JEFF PROBST:
<i>16 Americans</i>
<i>forced to abandon ship</i>

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,297
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,554
<i>Marooned for 39 days,</i>
<i>they must work together</i>

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>to build shelter,</i>

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>find food and survive</i>
<i>the island,</i>

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,644
<i>but ultimately,</i>
<i>it is everyone for themselves.</i>

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,104
<i>Every third night</i>

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>they will hike</i>
<i>deep into the jungle</i>

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,734
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council</i>

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,110
<i>where they must vote</i>
<i>one of their own</i>

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,236
<i>off the island.</i>

12
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,239
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>only one will remain</i>

13
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>and will leave the island</i>

14
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

15
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,290
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor:

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,458
<i>The merge</i>
<i>was on everyone's mind</i>

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>as the two tribes</i>
<i>prepared to become one.</i>

18
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,129
We do got the merge coming.

19
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,922
(<i> growling</i> )

20
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,631
JEFF:
<i>At Tagi, Rich was flexing</i>

21
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,967
<i>his voting alliance muscles.</i>

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,886
RICHARD:
<i>I am in control</i>

23
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,304
of who's being voted off

24
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,514
and I think that's all
that matters to me.

25
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,767
JEFF:
<i>And Sue was deciding</i>

26
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,268
<i>who on Pagong</i>
<i>should be voted off</i>

27
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,603
<i>after the merge.</i>

28
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,854
Greg, definitely--
he's just way

29
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,314
<i>too psychotic.</i>

30
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,356
JEFF:
<i>At Pagong,</i>
<i>Gervase made a comment</i>

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,193
<i>that upset</i>
<i>his female tribe mates.</i>

32
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,445
Girls are the stupidest things
on the planet next to cows.

33
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,364
Oh! He called us "stupid."

34
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,283
Go!

35
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,159
JEFF:
<i>The immunity challenge became</i>
<i>more competitive than ever</i>

36
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,661
<i>because if Pagong won,</i>

37
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,997
<i>they would enter the merge</i>
<i>with six members</i>

38
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>to Tagi's four, giving them</i>
<i>a voting advantage.</i>

39
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,501
Yeah, you guys!

40
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,503
JEFF:
<i>But Tagi won,</i>

41
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>insuring them that the tribes</i>
<i>would merge</i>

42
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,173
<i>at five members each.</i>

43
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,466
<i>The loss sent Pagong</i>

44
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,804
<i>back to Tribal Council</i>
<i>where Greg joined the women</i>

45
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>in voting Joel off the island.</i>

46
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,142
<i>On the eve of the merge,</i>
<i>ten are left.</i>

47
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,896
<i>Who will be the first voted out</i>
<i>of the newly formed tribe?</i>

48
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,902

<i>Survivor</i> has reached
a turning point.

52
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,376
Very soon, the ten remaining
members of Tagi and Pagong

53
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,629
<i>will form one new tribe.</i>

54
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,423
<i>They will live together</i>
<i>but they will now compete</i>

55
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>against each other</i>
<i>individually.</i>

56
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,927
<i>There are many questions</i>
<i>to be answered:</i>

57
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,804
<i>Where will they live?</i>

58
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,723
<i>What will this new tribe</i>
<i>call themselves?</i>

59
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,308
<i>What kind of world</i>
<i>will they now create?</i>

60
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,437
<i>To begin the process,</i>
<i>an ambassador from each tribe--</i>

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,481
<i>Jenna from Pagong</i>
<i>and Sean from Tagi--</i>

62
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,276
<i>will assess the livability</i>
<i>of each other's camp.</i>

63
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,820
<i>They will then paddle out</i>
<i>to the sand spit for a summit</i>

64
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,571
<i>where they will negotiate</i>
<i>and decide</i>

65
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,616
<i>on which of the two beaches</i>

66
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,867
<i>this new tribe of ten</i>
<i>will live.</i>

67
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>Their decision will be final.</i>

68
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,622
<i>Sean is being guided</i>
<i>to Pagong Beach by Greg,</i>

69
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,125
<i>and Jenna is being guided</i>
<i>to Tagi by Kelly.</i>

70
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,127
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>either ambassador</i>

71
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,337
<i>has seen the opposing tribe's</i>
<i>camp.</i>

72
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,756
Our camp's way better
than theirs

73
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,757
just from talking to them.

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,758
They don't have

75
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,259
<i>a living room with benches,</i>

76
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,427
<i>never mind a decent kitchen.</i>

77
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,930
<i>I think our house is better</i>

78
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,139
from what they've described.

79
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,390
We have fish.

80
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,434
<i>Gretchen and I both fished</i>
<i>for an hour.</i>

81
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,936
<i>Really?</i>

82
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:48,937
Nothing. Not even a bite.

83
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,313
When do you guys fish?

84
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,814
Early morning, late evening.

85
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,690
Yeah, that's when we fish.

86
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,859
But, you know,
we got the gay guy...

87
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,902
gay compassionate guy.

88
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,195
He's, like, middle-of-the-road.

89
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,112
And you got Sue

90
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,198
who says whatever
the hell's on her mind.

91
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,158
SUSAN:
<i>As far as somebody coming here</i>

92
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,451
from Pagong today,
it's going to be fun.

93
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,622
<i>We like having company</i>
<i>over at camp,</i>

94
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,415
<i>even though we don't have</i>
<i>a whole lot to offer for lunch.</i>

95
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,793
<i>I'm hoping...</i>
<i>I think the kicker of it all</i>

96
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,211
will be if Rich gets fish

97
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,379
<i>and we have fish for lunch.</i>

98
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,505
<i>I think they'll be here.</i>

99
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,175
And Rich... Rich
is a sweetheart.

100
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:19,717
So easygoing.

101
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,343
He's naked a lot.

102
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,512
Um... okay.

103
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,348
I'm excited about it being
a big group, because right now

104
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,476
<i>there's not a lot</i>
<i>of personalities going on</i>

105
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,186
<i>and it's quiet</i>

106
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:33,690
<i>and we've seen every inch</i>
<i>of this little place here,</i>

107
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,566
<i>and I'm excited</i>
<i>to meet new people,</i>

108
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,528
<i>and even if it's some good,</i>
<i>some bad,</i>

109
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,238
or whatever,
at least, it's something.

110
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,864
It's a mix and so it'll be
more interesting

111
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,241
than it is right now.

112
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,160
Oh, good,
they sent the doctor.

113
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,163
Hi. How are you?

114
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,331
I'm fine.

115
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,000
Nice to see you.

116
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,417
What's going on, man?

117
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,836
How do you feel?

118
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,045
Good. How about you?
Nice to see you, man.

119
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,005
You want a tour?

120
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,257
Yeah, let me have a tour.
Take me around.

121
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,846
Hi, Sue.
How are you?

122
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:05,847
Good.

123
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,724
The sun's out.
Beautiful...

124
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,059
Stingray, cuttlefish
and lobster for lunch.

125
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,394
(<i> squeals</i> )

126
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,229
We're having rock lobster
for lunch.

127
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,606
Hey, Kel, check out
the cuttlefish.

128
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,066
Nice, nice.
Deluxe.

129
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,860
With a working lid
and everything.

130
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,861
Wi-with lid.
Uh-huh.

131
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,238
How often do you
guys move that?

132
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:22,989
Never.

133
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:23,573
This is, uh,
chef Rudy.

134
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,575
Check out
the kitchen.

135
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,243
Chef Rudy, um, can I
go in your kitchen?

136
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,244
OhOkay.h.

137
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,871
Wipe your feet.

138
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,789
"Rowdy Rudy's Diner"

139
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,585
This is where we keep spices,
toilet paper, candles...

140
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,087
fruit peels
go in there.

141
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,338
Nice.

142
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,548
This is so nice.

143
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,258
RICHARD:
Isn't that a cool kitchen?

144
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,886
So, see, now,
these are our Damn!en hammocks.

145
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,763
Oh, yeah, sleep five
really comfortable.

146
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,431
Ours is about
the same size,

147
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,100
but it's lifted a little higher
in the back.

148
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,643
And, uh, right
now, we've just...

149
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,103
we got two
mosquito nets.

150
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,938
The guys go
on the left

151
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,107
and me and Sue and
Rich, the girls,
go on the right.

152
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,108
Go ahead and pull out...

153
00:05:59,192 --> 00:05:59,942
Yeah, we have
this thing...

154
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,611
If you want,
I'll diagram what we got.

155
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,780
Nice.

156
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,573
Super bench,
living room area.

157
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,783
Oh, my God,
you guys are

158
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,575
very, very
well-organized.

159
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,576
(<i> laughing</i> )

160
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,620
So much more than ours.

161
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,662
Have a seat.

162
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,460
Hey, not too bad.

163
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,921
We got plenty
of this, too.

164
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,464
We don't eat
that much of it.

165
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,465
No?

166
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,591
No. We<i> have</i> it.

167
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,134
We don't eat it.

168
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,969
GERVASE:
We live off
this stuff.

169
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,263
It's a lot of work
for a little bit of sugar

170
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:29,806
it seems to me,
you know?

171
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,141
You guys are amazing.

172
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,143
Like a well-
oiled machine.

173
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,937
The stingray
looks wonderful.

174
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,146
KELLY:
Stingray is so good.

175
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,689
Stingray is<i> incredible.</i>

176
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,441
Does it
grab you?

177
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,484
Whoa.

178
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,444
Is it funkified
already?

179
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,824
Fermented?

180
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,492
That's not good.

181
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,243
Number two.

182
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,286
SUSAN:
You know, you kind of get...

183
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,496
Ah, there's a lot of meat
on that bad boy.

184
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,747
Yeah, just try that.

185
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,582
SUSAN:
Yeah.

186
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,669
Oh, my God.

187
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,171
SUSAN:
Isn't it good?

188
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,464
It's delicious.

189
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,468
I don't need anymore,
you know.

190
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,011
You know...

191
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,304
I mean, uh...

192
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,473
Right off, just chew
on the cuttlebone.

193
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,641
Hey, you know...

194
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,184
RICHARD:
It's calamari.

195
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,185
<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>just like squid.</i>

196
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,311
<i>It's the exact same thing.</i>

197
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,855
<i>If you've had fried calamari,</i>

198
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,647
well, we're having roasted.
That's awesome.

199
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,649
Here.

200
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,153
RICHARD:
That lobster, it's so sweet.

201
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,154
This is<i> delicious.</i>

202
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,989
(<i> laughing</i> )

203
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,657
That's what we
want you to say
when you get home.

204
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,867
Just tell them

205
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,201
how good
everything is.

206
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,953
Food, golden.

207
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,082
Yeah, when we merge tonight,
I think it'll be interesting.

208
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,669
I think, uh, it'll set up
a whole nother set

209
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,714
of interpersonal dynamics
that'll be fun for me to watch.

210
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,674
Tell us more, uh, like,
rumors you've heard about us,

211
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,592
or things you think you know
Okay.t us...

212
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,178
or what do you want to know
about us?

213
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,721
All right, um, let's see--
"rumors that I've heard"--

214
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,932
that you guys are plotting
an alliance against us...

215
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,559
divide and conquer
sort of thing.

216
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,560
That's the big one.

217
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,061
The alliance
that we have going on

218
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,106
is Rich, Rudy, Kelly and me.

219
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,566
<i>We'll vote four people strong,</i>

220
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,776
<i>and if we can make it</i>
<i>through the first two votes,</i>

221
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,694
<i>getting somebody</i>
<i>off of their team off...</i>

222
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,821
(<i> chuckles</i> )

223
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,449
we should be able to slide
into home plate.

224
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,159
Yeah, you only get...

225
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,077
We don't know any of you;
you don't know any of us.

226
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,162
Exactly,
and I'm<i> so</i> excited

227
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,580
to get to know
five new people.

228
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,581
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Cool.re we.

229
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,207
Jenna's sincere.

230
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,750
I believe
Jenna's sincere,

231
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,751
and I think
Gretchen's sincere,

232
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,628
but Gren...
Jenna is young, and not

233
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,754
a mature young
like you.

234
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,755
She's young.

235
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,382
She's young flaky.

236
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,592
JENNA:
I wanted to come across
as a strong young mom

237
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,593
'cause I think

238
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,594
they're often portrayed

239
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,763
as victims of circumstance,

240
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,682
and, uh...
wanted to be a good role model

241
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,767
for my girls when they see it
when they get older.

242
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,769
She wants to be proud
for her children.

243
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,728
Proud for your children--
win.

244
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,605
She's just really
happy to be here.

245
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,649
Show your girls what it's about
and how to win.

246
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:48,945
Six days ago, I was 180 out,
but, uh, I seen the light.

247
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,529
It's... (<i> chuckles</i> )

248
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,657
If you want to win this money,
you got to get a little dirty.

249
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,909
You know, who's next,
don't you?

250
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,953
I don't need to
deal with that.
Who, after Greg?

251
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,954
Jenna.

252
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:58,955
I was thinking Sean.

253
00:08:59,038 --> 00:08:59,956
Oh, yeah.

254
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,415
He's too much
competition

255
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,833
and he will not
participate.

256
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,963
The reason Sean's not
in the alliance

257
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,798
because... Sean...

258
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,007
is dumb.

259
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,094
So, Sean, are they,
uh, planning on
banding together

260
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,303
and picking us
off one by one?

261
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,265
SEAN:
I think they've changed
their minds, you know, because

262
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,015
I think they have
very nice, warm

263
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,309
touchy feelings
towards you guys.

264
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,479
Sean's ethically against
any kind of alliance

265
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,773
and I hear Gretchen is similar
on the other side

266
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,359
and, um... I don't get it.

267
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,819
You know, I-I consider myself

268
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,738
extraordinarily ethical
and moral

269
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,156
<i>and, uh, this has</i>

270
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>absolutely nothing to do</i>
<i>with this.</i>

271
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,160
<i>Uh, it sounds like</i>
<i>sheer stupidity to me</i>

272
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,328
<i>when somebody says</i>

273
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,830
<i>"Oh, no, I'm not going</i>
<i>to build an alliance,</i>

274
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,041
<i>and I hope they wouldn't</i>
<i>do that either."</i>

275
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,711
Uh, you know, I giggle
and think, "okay."

276
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,337
(<i> laughing</i> )

277
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,338
God, I'm glad I'm
on your team.

278
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,881
Yeah, baby.

279
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,841
Didn't come
here to...

280
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,051
make friends.

281
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,306
I got to lug
one of you guys?

282
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,686
GERVASE:
<i>Sean's cool.</i>
<i>Sean's a nice guy.</i>

283
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,854
He had a lot of stories
to tell, and...

284
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,691
I mean, he... he was just,
like, a genuine, honest guy--

285
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,735
you know, what he said,
you just believed what he said.

286
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,322
<i>You can just tell</i>
<i>he wants to have some fun.</i>

287
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,865
<i>He hasn't had fun yet,</i>
<i>so, uh...</i>

288
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,658
we'll bring lots of fun his way.

289
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,909
We'll keep him entertained.

290
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,369
(<i> both talking at once</i> )

291
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,871
I will.

292
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,831
Bye, Rich. Bye, Rudy.

293
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,834
RUDY:
<i>Jenna and Sean are going</i>
<i>to have a good time talking.</i>

294
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,211
I don't know which one
talks the most.

295
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,464
She ain't shut up
since she's been here.

296
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,597
Bye, guys.

297
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:39,930
Bye, girl.

298
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,767
Bye, Sean!

299
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,791
JEFF:
<i>Welcome, Jenna.</i>

300
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,794
A chair just for you.

301
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,754
And look at me--
I didn't dress
for dinner.

302
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,215
How you doing?
Nice to see you.

303
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:14,924
Hello. How are you?

304
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,134
Wow, we're off
to a good start.

305
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,303
A little kiss--
Pretty cool.

306
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,179
Well, here's the deal:

307
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,057
You guys are ambassadors
for your tribes.

308
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,809
You have a very important task
tonight.

309
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,020
We wanted you to
feel like ambassadors,
so we've prepared

310
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,815
some lobster,
you have some bread,

311
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,274
baked potatoes,

312
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,276
butter for the lobster,

313
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,487
uh, lemon-- I don't think

314
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,072
we missed anything
except for the wine

315
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,281
which is being chilled
right now.

316
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,117
What I need
in the morning is

317
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,618
on this parchment, with
a couple of pens in here,

318
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,954
to have the new name
of the tribe...

319
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,581
which camp
you're going to be at,

320
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,125
and the three items
you're taking.

321
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,001
You'll be given one new color
for this new tribe--

322
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,796
green-- yellow and
orange no longer used

323
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,131
to represent opposing tribes.

324
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,173
You are now one.

325
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,299
There's also stuff

326
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,301
to make two new flags for camp.

327
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,470
There are paintbrushes, paints,

328
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,307
so once you decide on the name,
you can go to town on that.

329
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,600
Can we eat first?

330
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,935
You can do...
you have all night.

331
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,271
As you can see... right here,
we have two beds.

332
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,355
Oh, my God.)

333
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,315
So we are definitely
staying here tonight?

334
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,984
You are here all night.

335
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,986
Jenna, how stylin' are we!

336
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,875
I immediately saw the table
set up with...

337
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,502
it was like a romantic dinner.

338
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,130
It was like this table all set
up with everything, two beds

339
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,673
<i>off to the right</i>

340
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,134
<i>single, like,</i>
<i>really nice sheets</i>

341
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,552
and pillows and blankets,
and, uh...

342
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,219
like, a stump,

343
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,305
<i>we had a bedside table,</i>

344
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,015
<i>we had lanterns everywhere,</i>
<i>tiki torches,</i>

345
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:46,891
<i>and the first thing</i>
<i>I thought was...</i>

346
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,435
"Oh, man,
they're so setting this up

347
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,395
for it to be romantic with Sean"

348
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,689
and there's just...
there's not a spark there.

349
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,524
Making out's, I think,
first base;

350
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:55,941
second base, up the shirt;

351
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,527
Okay, okay...

352
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,530
But I often give a bad first
impression sometimes.

353
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,199
You never heard
of bases like that?

354
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,950
I always just knew
what the home run was.

355
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,076
I'm all about the goal.

356
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,077
I'm goal-oriented.

357
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,412
Sliding into home plate

358
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,873
Okay.s Jenna.

359
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,416
They wanted it to be
more romantic

360
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,210
than it was ever going to be,
but, uh...

361
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,212
<i>from either end of us,</i>
<i>but we really had</i>

362
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,007
<i>an exceptional time,</i>
<i>and we tied one on, you know,</i>

363
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,883
uh, finished the bottles
of wine,

364
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,260
and we ate like
kings and queens,

365
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,845
and, uh, it was fantastic.

366
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,722
Uh, we saw Pagong's fire
was still lit

367
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,682
so I was like,
"Oh, I want to call home.

368
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,892
They're probably worried."

369
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,561
And, uh, so we threw
a bunch of kerosene on our fire

370
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,854
to make it whoosh,

371
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,397
<i>and they said they saw that,</i>

372
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,107
<i>so I hoped</i>
<i>that they would figure</i>

373
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,068
<i>that I was still there,</i>
<i>that I was okay.</i>

374
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,945
Whoa. Fire
on the spit.

375
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,114
It seems so far away
from the island.

376
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,910
GREG:
They had to have fed Jenna.

377
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,955
I mean, the summit going
from 4:00 in the afternoon

378
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,040
until... well after dark...

379
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,084
Yeah. They're not going
to let her starve.

380
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,585
With one lunch.

381
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,088
Well, Gervase can save hers
in case...<i> his</i>

382
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,509
in case she... wants to see
what it would have been like.

383
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,931
JENNA:
<i>We talked all night.</i>

384
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,767
<i>It helped that they had</i>
<i>four bottles of wine there.</i>

385
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,269
<i>So we drank them all</i>

386
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,646
and, uh, we were both
pretty drunk.

387
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,940
And... it's raining,
and we're inside now.

388
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,942
We're completely
covered.made it.

389
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,444
We had a great meal.

390
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,115
Me, I'm exhausted from
all this wine.

391
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,992
Do you want to go to bed?

392
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,608
GRETCHEN:
<i>We're just waiting</i>
<i>'cause no one's given us</i>

393
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,817
<i>any information.</i>

394
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,193
<i>So, I mean, last night</i>

395
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,987
we were wondering where she was.

396
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,196
And then somebody said
"Well, she can't come back

397
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,656
until the negotiations
are over."

398
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,699
<i>But there's really nothing</i>
<i>to negotiate.</i>

399
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>We could have made a shelter</i>

400
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,827
<i>in that time.</i>
<i>We could have made--</i>

401
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,661
<i>whatever they're</i>
<i>negotiating for,</i>

402
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,245
we could have moved
our whole camp--

403
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,664
been done in that time.

404
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,081
So I don't, I don't know what
the whole process is about.

405
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,166
We miss Jenna.

406
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,336
We haven't seen Jenna at all

407
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,962
<i>since she's left,</i>

408
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,213
<i>and we were kind of worried</i>
<i>about her last night</i>

409
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,883
when it got dark
and she wasn't here.

410
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,510
GREG:
<i>I'd be wasting</i>
<i>my time and energy</i>

411
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,679
<i>to, uh, guess what's happening.</i>

412
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,096
So I don't even bother.

413
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,181
What's going on?

414
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,183
It's a beautiful day.

415
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,351
The sun's nice.

416
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,977
You can see Mount Kinabalu

417
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,812
and, uh,
we're going to go fishing.

418
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,022
RUDY:
That's a big one.

419
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,316
RICHARD:
Yeah, he's a good fatty.

420
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,318
That's a lot of meat.

421
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,196
They talked about some kind
of a negotiation,

422
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,492
and I would imagine if the two
parties had opposing views

423
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,994
as to what camp
they should move to

424
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,204
<i>that the negotiation</i>
<i>might go on--</i>

425
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,665
<i>or might be interesting.</i>

426
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,041
<i>But since both parties,</i>

427
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,586
<i>as far as we know,</i>
<i>want to move to this camp,</i>

428
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,213
I can't imagine what's going on
on the sand spit.

429
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,174
SUSAN:
<i>We're not sure yet,</i>
<i>because Sean has been gone</i>

430
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,259
<i>almost 24 hours now</i>
<i>since we sent him off</i>

431
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,220
<i>on the messenger thing.</i>

432
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,181
So the anticipation
of waiting for Sean

433
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,685
is just actually starting
to drive us wild.

434
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,297
Oh, my God!

435
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,426
I have so much
to tell you guys.

436
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,976
First things first--

437
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,102
we are moving.

438
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,896
We have five minutes
from when we banked

439
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,148
to get everything in
your backpacks--

440
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,775
to get your luxury item.

441
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,610
Only what you brought
in your backpacks

442
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,028
and luxury item--

443
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,238
and three objects,
which we chose,

444
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,781
and we're out of here.

445
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,867
And we told Pagong
the unfortunate news

446
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,703
that they had five minutes
to pack their things--

447
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,164
get their luxury item
and choose three items.

448
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,666
<i>Which we decided were the wool</i>
<i>blanket that they have,</i>

449
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,959
<i>the mosquito netting,</i>

450
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,419
<i>so we could sleep</i>

451
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,296
<i>under the mosquito netting,</i>

452
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,797
<i>and the, um, cooking pot.</i>

453
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,674
We were given
a luxury dinner,

454
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,801
but we had to decide
a new name

455
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,178
and we had to paint
the new flag,

456
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,263
and we had to pick
a location--

457
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,640
she liked
our camp a lot.

458
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,767
You guys will love it.

459
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,310
Actually, Sean let me do
almost all of the deciding.

460
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,438
I came up with the name,
he added an "a" on the end.

461
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,315
Jenna came up with the name.

462
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,276
<i>It had to be something that</i>
<i>was indigenous to the island</i>

463
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,820
<i>and, you know, we have a lot</i>
<i>of rattan wood here.</i>

464
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,988
<i>And we just added an "a"</i>

465
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,323
to make it sound more exotic.

466
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,866
That was my idea.

467
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,242
You know, give it a little
flair, a little pizzazz.

468
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,495
JENNA:
As we were dining
on lobster and, um...

469
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,705
baked potatoes.

470
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,706
SEAN:
Dessert.

471
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,791
JENNA:
Four bottles of wine.

472
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,335
SEAN:
Four bottles of wine.
Four bottles of wine.

473
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,336
A hangover
in the morning.

474
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,004
Beds, a tent. bed...

475
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:09,671
GREG:
<i>You know, they come back</i>

476
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,507
<i>having had a great night</i>

477
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,842
and "oh, my God, I can't wait
to tell you guys

478
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,093
how much we've eaten."

479
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,428
And that's wonderful.

480
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,554
That's how ambassadors
should be treated.

481
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,724
But, you know, of course,
when you're on an island

482
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,310
surviving on white rice
and the occasional fish...

483
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,354
SEAN:
<i>Four croissants</i>
<i>with orange marmalade</i>

484
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,980
and strawberry jam.

485
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,066
Coffee... four bottles.

486
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,776
Hey, tell me a little bit
more about it.

487
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,318
I'd love to hear
about butter sauce.

488
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,363
Like... thanks.

489
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,032
GERVASE:
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it just makes more sense</i>

490
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,575
<i>to go to their side.</i>

491
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,494
I mean, I think that's what
everybody wanted to do anyway.

492
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,037
Everybody wanted to get out
of this section

493
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,872
<i>just for a new change</i>
<i>of scenery.</i>

494
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,166
<i>We've been here for 20 days.</i>

495
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,459
<i>We've seen it. We know it.</i>

496
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,794
<i>So it was just like,</i>

497
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,462
you know,
let's try something new.

498
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,215
COLLEEN:
<i>Sean was even saying there's</i>
<i>enough room for us in the hutch</i>

499
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,175
<i>because enough people</i>
<i>sleep outside, so...</i>

500
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,426
<i>It's going to go quick.</i>

501
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,222
God, I hope it goes quick from
here on out, you know. Really.

502
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,932
When I first got here,
I... you know,

503
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,727
I think maybe I would have been
more comfortable

504
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,895
on the other team,
because I, you know,

505
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,107
from what I understand,
they pulled their camp together,

506
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,567
they got their stuff
hanging up,

507
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,694
which is, like, something
that's been bothering me

508
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,195
since the day we got here,
and...

509
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,239
but I think it was good for me
to be with this tribe

510
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,201
<i>because, um, you don't have</i>
<i>to work all the time</i>

511
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,578
<i>and you don't have</i>
<i>to be busting butt.</i>

512
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,579
<i>It's nice... you know,</i>

513
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,747
<i>we're healthy and we're happy</i>

514
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,749
<i>and we spend a lot</i>
<i>of time having fun.</i>

515
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,751
<i>So I think it taught</i>
<i>me something, too.</i>

516
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,461
<i>You can be very comfortable</i>

517
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,882
and I don't feel like I need
to bust butt all the time,

518
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,717
and I've had a good time
while I'm here.

519
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
So I'll be glad to go
with the other tribe

520
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,345
and I was glad to be
with this tribe.

521
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,167
GREG:
<i>It's like starting over.</i>

522
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,501
<i>We've left behind</i>

523
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,337
<i>a lot of things--</i>
<i>a lot of material possessions.</i>

524
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,964
<i>Metaphysically, we've also</i>
<i>left behind</i>

525
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,633
<i>a lot of emotional issues.</i>

526
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,844
<i>Um... there was</i>
<i>a lot of baggage</i>

527
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,973
that we left on that...
on that Pagong Beach.

528
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,516
But, uh...

529
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,811
we're moving on
to bigger and better things.

530
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,979
I'm excited.

531
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,439
<i>I did feel sadness</i>
<i>when we left Pagong.</i>

532
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,150
<i>Looking back, that was where</i>

533
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,319
we rode to the first day
when we were shipwrecked.

534
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,655
It was where I'd formed a bond
with eight...

535
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,656
seven other people, so...

536
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,324
<i>it was sad.</i>

537
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,492
<i>But it was a new beginning</i>
<i>for me-- a whole nother tribe.</i>

538
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,620
Are we close to Tagi?

539
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,623
I don't think that's
what it's called anymore.

540
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,666
It's Rattana.

541
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:55,045
(<i> laughing and talking</i> )

542
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,339
Come on, left side.

543
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,925
Come on, left side.

544
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,183
God, it's
beautiful.

545
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,851
Yeah, it really is.

546
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,812
COLLEEN:
<i>So Rich came out,</i>
<i>it was like</i>

547
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,188
"Hey, how are you?"

548
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,107
You know, he swam out,
which was really nice.

549
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,858
They welcomed us
with open arms.

550
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,152
<i>We got along really well.</i>

551
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,195
Welcome.

552
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,571
Ooh!

553
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,997
So, what they
were really doing was coming

554
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,165
<i>to the beach</i>
<i>and, uh, were moving in</i>

555
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,042
<i>with what things</i>
<i>they could have gotten together</i>

556
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:34,751
<i>in the five minutes</i>
<i>that they had</i>

557
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,544
<i>to get together, I guess.</i>

558
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,046
I was glad to see that.

559
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,381
Hi. Nice
to see you again.

560
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,549
Can I get a hug,
all right?

561
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,550
You, too, handsome.

562
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,552
Were you guys
worried about me?

563
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,594
Oh, yeah, yeah.

564
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,891
Clothesline.

565
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,393
House.

566
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:51,685
Living room.

567
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,561
Kitchen.

568
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,562
Bathroom.

569
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,439
Oh, my.

570
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,815
The house ain't done yet.

571
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,775
We can't tour
the house yet, no.

572
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,860
GREG:
<i>A boy named Sue.</i>

573
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,195
Strong, loud, with an accent

574
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,281
that'll drive you
<i>up the wall!</i>

575
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,574
Was he talking about me?

576
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,575
Oh, yeah.

577
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,576
Oh, come on!

578
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,577
I'm up.

579
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,245
Remind me
to do it.

580
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,580
Yeah, you had
a good one.

581
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,623
This thing's
about 300 years old.

582
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,459
I think Rudy's
very set in his ways,

583
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,085
so having, you know,

584
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,754
<i>five new people move in,</i>
<i>it scared him a lot,</i>

585
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,297
<i>so he was just sitting back</i>

586
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>and he was assessing</i>
<i>the situation, I think.</i>

587
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,302
All of a sudden,
we doubled our population.

588
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,387
<i>Uh, the house got smaller,</i>

589
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,890
<i>the pots got smaller,</i>

590
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,225
<i>and, uh...</i>

591
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,477
personally,
it's a pain in the ass.

592
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,605
New people,
new scene...

593
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,523
new things
to talk about,
you know.

594
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,651
(<i> general conversation</i> )

595
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,569
KELLY:
<i>It's almost</i> too<i> good.</i>

596
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,738
<i>Like, everybody's too...</i>

597
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,323
"Oh, you go first."

598
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,741
"No, you go first,"
oh, you know, everybody's

599
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,411
<i>being real, real super polite,</i>
<i>you know, which is cool.</i>

600
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,455
COLLEEN:
<i>Sean is</i> very<i> intelligent.</i>

601
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,456
<i>Sometimes he says</i>
<i>interesting things.</i>

602
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,666
<i>Sometimes you tune out</i>

603
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,459
for a while,
and then he hits on something

604
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,795
so you tune back in, you know.

605
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,921
I mean, he's always going.

606
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,631
SEAN:
Girls always rank
"sense of humor"

607
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,800
then, like, "ambition"
and then all this other stuff

608
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,593
and then rank "looks,"
like, number five or six.

609
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,262
But meanwhile,
I know so many
unambitious,

610
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,305
good-looking guys,

611
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,140
who have absolutely
no personality,

612
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,975
that still get
a lot of girls.

613
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,061
I'm really going
to get skinny.

614
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,146
I got to go back
in the water. Bye.

615
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,190
GREG:
<i>Rich is clever</i>
<i>and, uh... I mean</i>

616
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,025
we'll start being honest now.

617
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,652
I think Rich thinks
he's very clever.

618
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,155
<i>He is, uh, relatively sharp,</i>
<i>and, uh...</i>

619
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,034
<i>he has a lot of things going on</i>
<i>in his mind that he, uh...</i>

620
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,496
<i>selectively decides, uh,</i>
<i>what he will share</i>

621
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,205
<i>and with whom.</i>

622
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,666
<i>Rich is playing a big game,</i>

623
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,710
which is very fun,
so he's awfully entertaining.

624
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,172
KELLY:
<i>That... it was suggested...</i>

625
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,048
that we should, you know,

626
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,592
"beef up" the supports
and everything.

627
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,719
<i>Okay, which, you know,</i>
<i>I don't know</i>

628
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,638
<i>I don't know anything</i>
<i>about shingles and roofing,</i>

629
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,057
and I just know
how to tie knots,

630
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,851
that's pretty much
all I know how to do.

631
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,195
Okay.

632
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,405
It ain't going
nowhere.

633
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,450
You might want
to tie this.

634
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,744
Ow!

635
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,954
Up and down.

636
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,540
(<i> loud crashing</i> )

637
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,208
That doesn't sound good.

638
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,209
Oh, yeah.

639
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,627
(<i> hearty laughter</i> )

640
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,587
I didn't
Oh, my God!

641
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,048
That did not
just happen.

642
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,383
Oh, my God.

643
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,718
And, bam, shingles break,

644
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,596
the whole roof
comes crashing down.

645
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,223
Felt like such an idiot.

646
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,225
It figures that the day
that everyone shows up

647
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,602
the whole roof caves in
while they're repairing it.

648
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:42,105
Yeah, it's the same as it is
back home, ladies,

649
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,148
here in the jungle.

650
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,442
The women are doing all the work

651
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,235
and the guys
are just hanging out

652
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,528
and b.s.'ing, yeah.

653
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,863
It's my turn.

654
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,406
I pick up
from here.

655
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,574
It's a hit.

656
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,783
I can hit you this card;
you can't drop.

657
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,994
Every time you get hit

658
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,580
you have to stay around
one more round.

659
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,586
(<i> gasping</i> )

660
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,004
Very good, Rich.

661
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,589
(<i> chuckles</i> )

662
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,133
The guys are kind of bumming
around, but I think that's good

663
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,718
'cause I think all the guys
got to get to know each other.

664
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,554
RICHARD:
Isn't that beautiful?

665
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,764
Don't lie.

666
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,807
It looks like mucus,
doesn't it?

667
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,768
SUSAN:
Oh, yeah.

668
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,603
Jammin'.

669
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,812
You see it, Sue?

670
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,813
You see anything?

671
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,440
(<i> laughing</i> )

672
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,150
It's how men and women relate,
you know.

673
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,610
The women-- we work together

674
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,445
<i>and we... it's a little...</i>
<i>women are always</i>

675
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,614
<i>a little bit competitive</i>
<i>in everything we do, you know,</i>

676
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,282
<i>so it's like</i>
<i>when you're working together</i>

677
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,784
<i>you're seeing</i>
<i>what the other person</i>

678
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,619
<i>can do, and you're proving</i>
<i>each other at the same time.</i>

679
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,955
Men can sit down
and talk for hours

680
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,789
<i>and walk away friends.</i>

681
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,126
You got the hang
of it now.

682
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,127
(<i> hearty chuckle</i> )

683
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,295
<i>Gervase was great.</i>

684
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,672
I beat the hell out of him

685
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,549
in a number of games
that I've never played before,

686
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,677
and he's, uh,
he's good at cards.

687
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,304
I think he could have been
letting me win.

688
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,597
Uh, who knows?

689
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,683
He could be playing the odds,
too.

690
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,184
It's natural to me.

691
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,769
What I do, I don't think
I'm doing anything special.

692
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,313
I'm just being myself.

693
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,357
But other people always say,
like, "You're a charmer."

694
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,692
"You're a smooth talker."

695
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,859
Looking real good
there, Rich.

696
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,986
Real good there.

697
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,820
Can you tell
Yeah.osing?

698
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,906
That makes me happy,
'cause I can't tell.

699
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,243
They don't...

700
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,536
they don't
cook out enough.

701
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,662
They're... they're great
for bait

702
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,707
but their insides
is just nothing but guts.

703
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,333
Greg's an interesting character.

704
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,501
He's young, too.
He's 24,

705
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,003
<i>and he was pretty cocky.</i>

706
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,339
<i>He was thinking he could go out</i>
<i>and get something, came back in</i>

707
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,340
with a sea urchin.

708
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,301
(<i> derisive chuckling</i> )

709
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,343
But that was good,
that shows people

710
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,054
that he who thought
he was a spear-fishing person

711
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,347
<i>could go out there,</i>
<i>no problem,</i>

712
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,807
<i>comes from the other tribe</i>

713
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,517
<i>and came back in,</i>
<i>telling everybody</i>

714
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,188
just how difficult it is--
that ups my value even more.

715
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,695
JENNA:
Free in sight,
less than 100 feet away

716
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,030
and we have, like...

717
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,823
I've got this girl laid out in,
like, across the back seat

718
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,994
of, like, a Suzuki Sidekick
and it was, like, incredible.

719
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,998
Come on. Who can
follow that?

720
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,042
Rich..

721
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,793
Rich, yay.

722
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,005
First night as one tribe
we sat around the campfire,

723
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,008
told stories-- very, very, very
revealing stories.

724
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:20,055
KELLY:
<i>Gretchen said she drank a fifth</i>
<i>of whiskey in two minutes</i>

725
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,306
<i>when she was 14</i>

726
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,851
and I would have never guessed
that about her, you know?

727
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,729
Sounds like we kind of have
a similar past.

728
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:32,150
This new group is, like,
it's like a banquet.

729
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,902
It's like a banquet of stories
and excitement.

730
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,862
Sean left
an orgy opportunity.

731
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:39,908
No, I left a two-on-one
opportunity. Two girls.

732
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,242
How come you
left it?

733
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,244
I was scared
out of my mind.

734
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,747
RUDY:
<i>Some of the stuff they talk</i>
<i>about don't interest me</i>

735
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,665
<i>and I don't want to hear it.</i>

736
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,541
I don't know.

737
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,419
They talk about a lot
of sex stuff.

738
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,213
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

739
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,343
(<i> rain pouring</i> )

740
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,972
Wait, Rudy.

741
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:06,976
You're going to be
good over there.

742
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,105
GRETCHEN:
Keep your hands to yourself.

743
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,940
RUDY:
Everybody's hands
all over me.

744
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,483
Damn, Rudy.

745
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,165
GRETCHEN:
<i>It rained again last night</i>

746
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,751
<i>and we had to rebuild the roof</i>

747
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,294
<i>of their shelter yesterday</i>

748
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,296
<i>and I think half of it</i>
<i>is leakproof</i>

749
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,257
<i>and half of it</i>
<i>doesn't have a roof,</i>

750
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,633
<i>and so a lot of us</i>
<i>got very wet.</i>

751
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:42,429
<i>And it's frustrating because we</i>
<i>had just moved from a shelter</i>

752
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,097
that we had worked out
all the bugs in

753
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,975
and kept us 90% dry.

754
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:52,522
RUDY:
<i>I was in there last night</i>
<i>and, uh, when the rain came</i>

755
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,482
all them women
eased down our way

756
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,444
and I had about five women
in my lap all of a sudden.

757
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,487
Rudy was kicking me in the head.
He doesn't care.

758
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,447
JENNA:
<i>Oh, yeah, people were getting</i>

759
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,990
<i>kicked in the head</i>
<i>all night long</i>

760
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,324
<i>because he got out three times</i>

761
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,826
and he would just barrel
through people.

762
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,663
RUDY:
<i>I mean, the pillows were</i>
<i>right across me,</i>

763
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,331
and I had to get up
and go to the head

764
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,374
and I couldn't.

765
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,917
I don't know.

766
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,794
Rudy kicked me in the head,
like, three times last night

767
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,837
and I said,
"Rudy, that's my head,"

768
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,338
and he said, "This is
my space, so..."

769
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,673
I said, "Rudy,
that's my head."

770
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:19,507
He goes, "That's my spot."

771
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,008
"I got to get out.
It's my spot."

772
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,343
That's what he said.

773
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,636
Did you ask him
to draw the outlines?

774
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,054
Hey, I'm the old guy,
don't forget.

775
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,057
Them young guys
might have liked it.

776
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,851
It's a pain in the ass to me.

777
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,187
You do the honors.

778
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,021
No, no, it's
yours now.

779
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,315
(<i> both laugh</i> )

780
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,317
Hey! I guess it's
not in there

781
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,359
but this is
different.

782
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,739
"The next challenge,
things couldn't be more fair.

783
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:47,202
"Just take a deep breath
and don't come up for air.

784
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,913
"Immunity's the same
except for this one note.

785
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,623
"Now only one will be safe

786
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:56,211
while the rest of you
face the vote."

787
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,545
I'm guessing

788
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,506
it's a "holding
your breath" competition.

789
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,223
Welcome to Snake Island.

790
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,558
Congratulations on surviving
the first phase.

791
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,060
You guys have now all proven

792
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,354
that you can definitely
survive the island.

793
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,897
I don't think
that's in question.

794
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,525
You've been here three weeks;
everybody's doing great.

795
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,236
Now it's going to be about
who can survive each other.

796
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,363
How well you guys survive
tribal politics.

797
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,699
We've replaced the immunity idol
with an immunity talisman,

798
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,076
so you will wear this
around your neck.

799
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,744
That means that
at Tribal Council

800
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,412
you cannot have any votes
cast against you.

801
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,748
You will not be voted off.

802
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,416
You can, however, vote
against others still,

803
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,668
so it's a great place to be.

804
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,422
This will go in the archives,
this becomes the treasured icon.

805
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,591
This is our first immunity
challenge as individuals.

806
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,552
It's very simple.
It's about holding your breath.

807
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,930
In the first round, all ten
of you will go under the water

808
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,931
to hold your breath.

809
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,684
You'll each hold
onto a bar that will

810
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,394
help keep you submerged.

811
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,605
The last three to surface
go on to the final round.

812
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,982
Make sense?

813
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,734
Head on in.

814
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,205
(<i> laughing</i> )

815
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,587
Survivors ready?

816
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,588
Go!

817
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,838
(<i> laughs</i> )

818
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,218
(<i> laughing</i> )

819
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,178
Come up for air.

820
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,981
Yeah, good job, Sue.

821
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,698
I guess I had to come up.

822
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,592
(<i> clock's second hand ticking</i> )

823
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,243
Yeah.

824
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,457
Yay!

825
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,836
Is he dead?

826
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:29,549
Everybody's up.

827
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,591
Come on, Gervase.

828
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,593
He doesn't know
if he should come up or not.

829
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,429
ALL:
Yay!

830
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,059
All right,
Gervase!

831
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,728
Sean, Gervase, Greg,
you guys are moving on.

832
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,604
The rest of you guys
can sit up here

833
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,606
on the dock with me
and take a break.

834
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,614
JEFF:
<i>Final round, this is it.</i>

835
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,033
<i>Still about</i>
<i>holding your breath,</i>

836
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,244
<i>but now we're adding speed.</i>

837
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,954
<i>We're going to swim out</i>
<i>to a buoy.</i>

838
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,581
<i>At the bottom</i>
<i>of the ocean floor</i>

839
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,125
<i>are three ladders,</i>
<i>one for each of you.</i>

840
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,251
<i>You're going to use the ladders</i>
<i>to get momentum,</i>

841
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,587
<i>and along the way are buoys.</i>

842
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,464
<i>Yank hard, release the buoy.</i>

843
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,423
<i>First person</i>
<i>to the end of the course</i>

844
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,760
that's released
all their buoys gets immunity.

845
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,803
Very simple.

846
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,262
Use the ladder,
it's much quicker.

847
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,305
All right?

848
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,306
Head out to
your buoys.

849
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,183
I'll give you a start.

850
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,225
Good luck.

851
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,499
Gervase! Greg! Sean!

852
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,834
This is for immunity--

853
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,003
the first individual immunity.

854
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,671
Win this,
you cannot be voted off.

855
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,174
Survivors ready!

856
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,175
Go!

857
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,844
Gervase!

858
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,013
Close! Very close, Greg!

859
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,432
(<i> cheering</i> )

860
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,560
You all right, Gervase?

861
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,187
Never swam like that
in my life, man.

862
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,566
Towards the very end, he
was a smidgen ahead of me,

863
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,400
and no matter
what I did,

864
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,111
we were right
at each other.

865
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,904
Feel like Miss America?

866
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,031
It's all you, man,
it's all you.

867
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:29,061
RICHARD:
<i>But even though we aren't</i>
<i>any longer two different teams,</i>

868
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,479
<i>I still have a team.</i>

869
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,607
It's going to be interesting
because we're not solid.

870
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,483
We're solid with one another,

871
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,737
but we're not
solidly unbeatable yet

872
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,447
<i>just by circumstance, because</i>
<i>there are only four of us</i>

873
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,659
<i>and there are ten people</i>
<i>still left on the island.</i>

874
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,827
KELLY:
<i>When you get</i>
<i>in that Tribal Council</i>

875
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,455
and you walk up and you see
that little piece of paper

876
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,456
and the thing that you
put the vote in--

877
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,126
it's all different.

878
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,420
You know, you might...
you might have a thought

879
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,424
and say, "Hey, I really don't
want to vote this person off."

880
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,467
<i>It's easier said than done.</i>

881
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,303
<i>An alliance</i>
<i>is easier said than done.</i>

882
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,097
GREG:
<i>If people are fear-</i>
<i>and self-preservation-motivated</i>

883
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,474
<i>they'll band together,</i>
<i>they'll form alliances,</i>

884
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,976
<i>they'll start</i>
<i>beating people out</i>

885
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,811
<i>to try and get rid</i>
<i>of the strong ones</i>

886
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,355
<i>and get rid of this</i>
<i>and get rid of that,</i>

887
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,439
and, uh, you know,
if that happens

888
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,650
I hope they vote me off
really soon

889
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,319
because, uh, that to me is--

890
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,446
whoa, cool flying fish--

891
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,573
that to me is really boring.

892
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,286
JENNA:
<i>Coming into this merger, I</i>
<i>consider it a brand-new tribe.</i>

893
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,456
<i>I want a vote</i>
<i>based on people's merits.</i>

894
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,999
<i>I don't want a vote based on</i>

895
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,501
"Let's get rid
of each of them first

896
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,503
and<i> then</i>
<i>come back to our tribe."</i>

897
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,631
I... I want a vote based on, uh,
who I really think should go,

898
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,549
<i>whether it be a member of our</i>
<i>tribe or a member of theirs.</i>

899
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,564
All right, welcome to

900
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,651
your first, uh, Tribal
Council as Rattana.

901
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,403
Doesn't change
the rules.

902
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,530
Doesn't change
anything here.

903
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,823
This is still
where you account
for your actions,

904
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,366
good or bad,

905
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,367
and, uh, by the
end of the night

906
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,203
one of you will be
voted off the island.

907
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:10,871
So let's talk
about the actions

908
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,914
of the past
few days.

909
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,708
Been a busy few days
with the merger.

910
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,209
Richard, with the
rules changing

911
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:18,379
how has that changed
the group dynamic?

912
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,547
You know,
I really haven't noticed

913
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,009
much of a change
in the dynamic at all. Um...

914
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,886
we still seem to just get
along really, really well.

915
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,973
There's only been two days
together as two teams

916
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:33,310
so there isn't, uh, really time
for conflict to develop yet.

917
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,395
Gretchen, is it
too soon to think

918
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,564
that strategies might shift?

919
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:41,068
Oh, I think people who are
strategically playing the game,

920
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,030
um, you know, strategy
has changed for them.

921
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,031
How so?

922
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,950
Well, from who's strongest
in your tribe to keep,

923
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,786
now who's strongest
in this one tribe to get rid of

924
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,997
'cause they're
your biggest competition.

925
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,582
Sean, aside from the physical--

926
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,084
who you want to hang
out with, who you
like being around--

927
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,335
how big a factor is that

928
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,004
now going to play
in who you vote for?

929
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,881
Well, for me it's still
a very big factor.

930
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,259
I think there's a lot of room
in a group of ten to not think

931
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:06,427
ultra-strategically
just yet.

932
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,429
In talking to my tribe

933
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,264
and talking to their tribe
as the ambassador

934
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,266
I think that most people
are very concerned

935
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,434
about alliances,
just having

936
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,145
a Tagi versus Pagong internal
bloodbath, you know, and

937
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,938
it's a--

938
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,398
yeah, that's a good word--

939
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,567
but, uh, I don't think
that's going to occur.

940
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,652
The rain is really coming down
all of a sudden.

941
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,447
All right, the only
person for whom

942
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,325
this does not really factor
in tonight is Greg.

943
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,826
You cannot vote
for Greg.

944
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,702
He however,
can still vote

945
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:36,082
for you, and will vote
for one of you.

946
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,291
So with that,

947
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,626
it's time to vote.

948
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,960
Greg, you're up first.

949
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,062
Either be here, or be gone.

950
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,538
I'm voting for Rudy.

951
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,041
He's probably the person that
I respect most in the tribe,

952
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,419
but the person I least
want to play the game with.

953
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,595
Overconfident.

954
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,902
Moo.

955
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,244
I am not really employing
any strategy.

956
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,204
I'm voting for Colleen today.

957
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,748
I love her, she's cute,
adorable and nice to look at

958
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,583
and fun to
have around,

959
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,586
but she's the first
in a long list

960
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,212
of alphabetical order

961
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,839
and she won't get
another vote from me

962
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,841
unless she pisses me off
or something.

963
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,342
But it's her turn today,
being the first...

964
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:10,634
alphabetical order.

965
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,517
JEFF:
Directly across from you
are the six torches

966
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,060
representing the first six
people voted off.

967
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,230
Tonight, one of your torches
will be added to that group.

968
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,566
I'll go tally the votes.

969
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,415
All right, I'll
read the votes.

970
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,836
"Jenna."

971
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,304
"Rich."

972
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,518
"Gretchen."

973
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,942
"Rudy."

974
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,366
"Sue."

975
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,205
"Colleen."

976
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:25,960
"Gervase."

977
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,838
Everybody
got nailed.

978
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,757
"Gretchen."

979
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:38,556
"Gretchen."

980
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,182
Oh, my God!

981
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,101
Oh, my God!

982
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:45,854
It's me.

983
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,285
Gretchen,
I need you

984
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,078
to bring me
your torch.

985
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,846
The tribe has spoken.

986
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,431
Yeah, they have.

987
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,895
It's time for
you to go.

988
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,856
Good-bye.

989
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,067
(<i> all saying good-bye</i> )

990
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,915
Well, if tonight's vote

991
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,459
is any indication,

992
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,045
the stakes have
definitely been raised.

993
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,047
You guys can head back to camp.

994
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,423
I'll see you
tomorrow.

995
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,231
<i>Next week on</i> Survivor...

996
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,400
<i>Greg cuts his play kitten</i>
<i>Colleen loose.</i>

997
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,527
You look right in the kitten's
eye and snap its neck.

998
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,779
It's nothing personal;
you're hungry.

999
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,405
<i>And makes a move on Rich.</i>

1000
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,866
RICH:
He's trying something.
That's great.

1001
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,618
<i>Tagi continues to plot.</i>

1002
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,869
Then it's their team,
one by one by one.

1003
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,080
<i>And things aren't great</i>
<i>for Jenna.</i>

1004
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,664
I miss my beauties.

1005
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,208
Now it seems like
she wants to leave the island.

1006
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,465
I would hope that
it was because

1007
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,133
<i>they felt that</i>
<i>I was a threat,</i>

1008
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,927
<i>unless, you know, people</i>
<i>had a conflict with me</i>

1009
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,595
<i>and didn't</i>
<i>ever voice it--</i>

1010
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:45,057
<i>which I do think</i>
<i>is kind of an injustice.</i>

1011
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,767
<i>And I would hope</i>

1012
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,268
<i>that if somebody had</i>
<i>a problem with me</i>

1013
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,812
<i>they would say it.</i>
<i>So, you know, I can hope that,</i>

1014
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,771
but I won't know
until I watch the show.

1015
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,772
I can hope that
it was because

1016
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,773
they thought
I was a threat.

1017
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,816
That would make me feel good.
