00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,419
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,837
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,255
>> Oh, my God, there were three!

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,339
>> PROBST: With their flint

5
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,841
to make fire at the bottom of

6
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:08,133
the ocean...

7
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,719
>> Oh, no!

8
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,511
>> PROBST: ...Koror had a

9
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,846
horrible night at their new

10
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:13,888
beach.

11
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:14,431
>> It was a mistake for us

12
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,181
to choose this island.

13
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,267
I regret that we didn't

14
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:17,642
think it through.

15
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,436
>> PROBST: At Ulong, Angie was

16
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,189
still feeling like an outsider.

17
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,607
>> I'm just making myself

18
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,276
a valuable asset to this tribe.

19
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,153
If I don't, I'll probably be on

20
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,279
the chopping block again.

21
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,448
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?

22
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,949
Go!

23
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,452
At the reward challenge,

24
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,663
the competition was brutal.

25
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,040
And Angie redeemed herself.

26
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:41,458
>> Good job, Angie!

27
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,042
>> PROBST: Angie is across.

28
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,669
Ulong wins reward!

29
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,420
Ulong walked away

30
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,046
with their first victory

31
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,256
as well as fishing gear...

32
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,632
Here's fire-- who wants it?

33
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,009
...and their own flint

34
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,511
to make fire.

35
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,262
At Koror...

36
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,889
>> I got it!

37
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,473
>> PROBST: Ian saved the day

38
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,223
when he helped salvage

39
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,601
the lost flint.

40
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,602
( cheering )

41
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,187
>> Getting the box was like

42
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,646
running a marathon

43
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,981
and winning first place.

44
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:05,857
>> Make love.

45
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,316
Don't blow too hard.

46
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,902
>> Who wants theirs first?

47
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:09,486
>> PROBST: Back at Ulong...

48
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,278
>> No, thank you.

49
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,071
I'm not hungry.

50
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:12,655
>> PROBST: Ashlee refused to

51
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,073
eat.

52
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:14,949
>> If we have someone

53
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:15,700
slowing us down, I hope that

54
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,534
that doesn't bring down

55
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:16,826
our team.

56
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,078
I think I'm going to crash.

57
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,580
>> PROBST: And the tribe noticed

58
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,664
sparks between Jeff and Kim.

59
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,749
>> Kim's been snuggling

60
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,751
on Jeff a lot.

61
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,960
I mean, two-people alliance

62
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,212
is a very strong alliance.

63
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,631
>> PROBST: At the next

64
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,590
challenge...

65
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,258
Kim, the only one yet to give it

66
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,176
a go for Ulong.

67
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,135
...Kim held Ulong back.

68
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:34,636
>> We gotta keep going.

69
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,178
We gotta keep going.

70
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,055
>> PROBST: Checking. Checking.

71
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:37,931
>> You sure?

72
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:38,723
>> PROBST: Koror!

73
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,058
>> Yeah!

74
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:40,600
>> PROBST: Koror won their

75
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,143
second immunity in a row.

76
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,853
Back at Ulong,

77
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,815
Stephenie wanted Kim out.

78
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,857
>> We need to break

79
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,233
Kim and Jeff up.

80
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,318
I mean, she didn't even try

81
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:50,693
at the challenge.

82
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,277
She sat out there.

83
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,153
>> Yeah.

84
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,196
>> She didn't go underwater.

85
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,198
>> PROBST: But there was a

86
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,157
divide in the opinions.

87
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,408
>> I was thinking Ashlee.

88
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,201
She's breaking down, man.

89
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,454
I can tell she's breaking down.

90
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,081
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

91
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,165
Kim and Jeff's relationship

92
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,792
came out in the open.

93
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,877
Kim, when did you feel

94
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,962
the first initial seeds

95
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:09,796
of any attraction?

96
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,797
>> It's hot in here

97
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,756
all of a sudden.

98
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,799
>> All jokes aside, there's no

99
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,842
alliances being built here.

100
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,009
>> PROBST: But when the votes

101
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,219
came in...

102
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
Second person voted out

103
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,639
of<i> Survivor: Palau...</i>

104
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,015
...Ashlee was sent packing.

105
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,810
Ashlee, the tribe has spoken.

106
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,186
16 are left.

107
00:02:25,270 --> 00:03:47,936
Who will be voted out tonight?

108
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,062
>> I really can't go back

109
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,146
there again.

110
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,189
Not soon.

111
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,398
We cannot lose any more reward.

112
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:57,654
We can't.

113
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,030
>> And, oh, Jeff was pretty

114
00:03:59,113 --> 00:03:59,822
tough today, I thought.

115
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,907
>> That's the way this game

116
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,033
goes, you know?

117
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:02,492
>> Yeah.

118
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,078
I think Tribal Council tonight

119
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,454
told a lot 'cause Kim and Jeff

120
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:06,829
both got votes.

121
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,331
If we would have went

122
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,332
with our original votes,

123
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,333
Ashlee'd still be here,

124
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:10,708
and Kim'd be gone.

125
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,044
I think Kim's aware,

126
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,297
and I think Jeff's aware, too.

127
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,674
>> Are you serious?

128
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,925
>> Mm-hmm.

129
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:19,550
I know, Jeff totally pinpointed

130
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,386
you guys, like, were a couple

131
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,595
or something.

132
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,721
>> I know. It was obnoxious.

133
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,722
>> And you know what?

134
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,057
You can't be like, "No, we're

135
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,225
just like really good friends."

136
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,559
You have to be like, "Oh, yeah,

137
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,394
we're kind of attracted

138
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,353
to one another."

139
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:30,728
You know, like...

140
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,313
>> It pisses me off.

141
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,731
It really does piss me off.

142
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,816
>> At Tribal,

143
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,775
Jeff was pretty brutal.

144
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,484
He asked me about Kim and I.

145
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,528
I just basically said that

146
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,029
we're keeping each other warm.

147
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,530
We...

148
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,365
It really does help

149
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,534
to have someone next to you.

150
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,753
>> I think the thing

151
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,130
between me and Jeff

152
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,214
has just been exaggerated

153
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,550
by everybody talking about it.

154
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,592
I don't want people conjuring

155
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,969
this image up in their head

156
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:03,970
that's not accurate,

157
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,013
and thinking that

158
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:05,555
there's two personal lives,

159
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,473
it's like strategy or what.

160
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,559
I don't want that image.

161
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,442
>> Jeff Probst asked Kim and

162
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,860
Jeff if there's anything going

163
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,903
on, you know?

164
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,821
And they said, "No,

165
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,031
we're just buddies, cuddling."

166
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:23,781
Mm-mm-- everybody sees

167
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,283
what they're doing.

168
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,076
Right now they're cuddling.

169
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,660
Next week, they're going to be

170
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,662
making out.

171
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,747
You know, sucking face

172
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,331
and stuff.

173
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:32,665
She's a woman,

174
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,917
and all she has to her advantage

175
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,127
is her sexuality.

176
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,628
Kim's got to go.

177
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,504
I'm keeping an eye on them.

178
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,049
I got ears like a bat,

179
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,508
I'm telling you.

180
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:50,475
( distant thunder rolling )

181
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,770
( seagulls crying )

182
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,111
>> Oh, man, look at that out

183
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,154
there.

184
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,113
>> It's the shower

185
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,948
we were all looking for.

186
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,158
It's been raining

187
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,243
a couple times a day.

188
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,162
We have kind of a lame shelter,

189
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:11,704
and we're kind of limited

190
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,081
to supplies here.

191
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,373
We're getting wet at night,

192
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,750
and we need a better shelter.

193
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,293
>> I've been digging and

194
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:17,919
digging-- a heavy day it's been.

195
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,796
I was not gonna let it go.

196
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,922
I'm trying to focus on

197
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:21,756
that damn shelter.

198
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,757
It's been three days,

199
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,758
and it's still not finished.

200
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,009
This is just going to take

201
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:25,885
a little thinking, girls.

202
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,427
( grunting )

203
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,429
Nine strong has its

204
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,013
advantages and disadvantages,

205
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,472
'cause, obviously,

206
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,641
we're all still together,

207
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,600
we're still strong.

208
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,601
Yeah, I think people are

209
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,602
grating their nerves even worse

210
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,020
'cause, you know, you can't

211
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,063
ever get rid of anybody.

212
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,688
You know you're stuck with them.

213
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,648
>> I need to ask you something.

214
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,691
If you can find more bamboo,

215
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,734
do you think you can?

216
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,610
>> It's hard to find.

217
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,653
>> Even getting something

218
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,654
on the other side if possible

219
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,239
to block out the...

220
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,240
Someone needs to get up

221
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,282
in that tree and do the top.

222
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,283
Don't you think?

223
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,409
>> Yeah.

224
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,078
>> Won't be me.

225
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,454
>> Katie is a very...

226
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,622
I don't know what the word is;

227
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,499
it's not outspoken,

228
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,458
it's tart, you know?

229
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,835
Just that she has something

230
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,211
to say all the time

231
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,003
about everything.

232
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,296
>> What are you going to do

233
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,588
with those?

234
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,509
>> I'm just filling gaps here.

235
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,635
>> I'm thinking we could use

236
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,012
those for the bed.

237
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,472
>> There's more, a lot more.

238
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,890
And it's especially true

239
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:13,766
with me.

240
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,184
For seven days, I've been not

241
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,185
saying anything,

242
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,645
and I've just had it.

243
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,896
And I just decided to confront

244
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,189
her; I want it to stop.

245
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,691
And I've just had enough!

246
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,609
Now, I don't want to make waves.

247
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,527
>> And you're making waves.

248
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,736
>> No, this is between you and

249
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,280
me.

250
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,364
I'm not making a scene

251
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,365
in front of the tribe.

252
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,408
And I don't want to bring

253
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,033
anyone else into this.

254
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:31,701
>> Why are you all freaked out?

255
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,619
>> Because everything I say,

256
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,329
you have some snotty remark.

257
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:35,830
I throw a freakin' stick

258
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,706
in the fire, you're like,

259
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,498
"Oh, they say don't throw

260
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,125
sticks in the fire."

261
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,376
Don't tell me what to do, Katie!

262
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:40,877
Don't tell me what to do

263
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,753
anymore.

264
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,338
I'm done hearing it.

265
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,214
>> I was just sitting

266
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,340
on the edge of the boat.

267
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,341
She just comes up to me

268
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,342
and she's, like,

269
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,719
"Do you have a problem with me?"

270
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,220
And I'm like, "What?"

271
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:51,971
And I started laughing

272
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,014
'cause she was so irate.

273
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,348
>> You said the guys said,

274
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:54,891
"Don't throw sticks in the

275
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,559
fire," like, everything I say,

276
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,602
you're on me.

277
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,563
Get off me!

278
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,689
>> She wouldn't even give me

279
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,857
the time to respond

280
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,358
to any of her accusations.

281
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,735
She wanted to come up to me

282
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,611
and just tell me off.

283
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,069
And then she went off

284
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,237
and she left.

285
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,488
She turns and frowns.

286
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,114
Like, I couldn't stop laughing.

287
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:10,615
She's crazy.

288
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,574
She's completely lost it.

289
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,826
I don't need you yelling at me.

290
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,994
I think there's a better

291
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:15,953
way of doing this.

292
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:16,913
>> Okay.

293
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,663
>> If there wasn't any

294
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,623
animosity, there is now,

295
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,665
'cause I don't like

296
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,917
people yelling at me.

297
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,084
>> The repercussions of my

298
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,461
confronting Katie will be that

299
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,670
she will not talk to me,

300
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,963
and that's just fine with me.

301
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,173
Unfortunately,

302
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,216
there might be some tension

303
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,634
around the tribe as well.

304
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,053
You will always run the risk

305
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,095
if you're too confrontational

306
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,347
of being the one who's voted

307
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,473
off, but I haven't heard

308
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,641
my name come up.

309
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,767
It could change now

310
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,645
as a result of what I did.

311
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,949
>> PROBST: I'll now bring in

312
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,785
the new Ulong tribe.

313
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,994
Ashlee voted out

314
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,289
at the last Tribal Council.

315
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,332
All right, you guys ready

316
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,166
for today's challenge?

317
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,209
>> We're ready.

318
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,168
>> Yeah.

319
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,086
>> PROBST: Today's challenge

320
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,254
is for a reward.

321
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,338
It is once again physical.

322
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,381
Here's how it works.

323
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,548
On my go,

324
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,841
a life ring will be released

325
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,218
from the bottom of the ocean.

326
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,302
Your goal?

327
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,762
Swim out, retrieve the ring,

328
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,931
bring it back to your

329
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:17,890
tribe-colored pontoon.

330
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,225
First tribe member to get

331
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:19,684
a hand on the pontoon

332
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,560
while having a hand

333
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,562
on the life ring

334
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,522
scores a point for their tribe.

335
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,481
Here's the catch.

336
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,649
Aside from punching

337
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,149
or otherwise intentionally

338
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,111
trying to hurt someone,

339
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,404
you can pretty much do whatever

340
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:31,946
you want to get that ring

341
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,573
and keep it and get back.

342
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,910
Push, pull, dunk, splash,

343
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,787
keeping in mind that ultimately

344
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,831
this is a social game.

345
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,790
And to win it,

346
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:43,916
you will need the votes

347
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,501
of the people you are living

348
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,752
with and competing against.

349
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,837
How you play it,

350
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,754
ultimately up to you.

351
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,839
First round, one man

352
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,216
from each tribe will square off.

353
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,801
Second round, one woman

354
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,344
from each tribe will square off.

355
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,512
After that,

356
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,013
we'll switch things up.

357
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,848
First tribe to score three

358
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,433
wins reward.

359
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,517
Want to know what

360
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,268
you're playing for?

361
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,394
>> Yes.

362
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,770
>> PROBST: Full-on sewing kit.

363
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,771
>> Nice.

364
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,772
>> Yes!

365
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,815
>> PROBST: I'm looking around,

366
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,942
I see a lot of people

367
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:10,860
in underwear.

368
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,902
We've got three buffs

369
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,820
working as skirts.

370
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,487
So, hopefully,

371
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,864
the reward will change

372
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,365
the way you guys look.

373
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:16,907
But if you are resourceful,

374
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,868
there are a lot of items

375
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,286
you can use around camp.

376
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,370
Worth playing for?

377
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,330
>> Hell, yeah.

378
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,247
>> PROBST: Koror, because you

379
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,248
have two extra members,

380
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,333
you're sitting two people out.

381
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,667
Who are you going to sit out?

00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:56,322
Jeff is going to hang back.

396
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,865
Jeff is going to let Tom

This is as physical

497
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,687
as it's gotten.

to say.

519
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,772
It's a tough physical challenge.

520
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,065
Ulong earned it; they won it.

521
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,150
I got nothing for you.

522
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,985
Ulong, nice job.

523
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:03,986
Good strategy.

524
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,821
You guys worked well together.

525
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,655
Here's your reward.

526
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,489
Be inventive.

527
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,617
Head back to camp.

528
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,590
>> That was so awesome.

529
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,633
We totally kicked their ass.

>> You're so awesome.

531
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,843
You're so quick.

532
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:28,927
>> It was a total shutout.

533
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,095
I'm going to tell you what.

534
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,305
Mmm...

535
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,723
That's what I'm talking about.

536
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,683
We kicked tail today

537
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,352
and we won a lot of things.

538
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,936
We can make a lot of different

539
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,520
types of garments.

540
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,647
We have so many tools.

541
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,064
>> Look.

542
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,065
>> This is elastic.

543
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,192
>> You could use these...

544
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,526
>> This is what we need.

545
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,653
...as fishing hooks.

546
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,655
>> The reward we won

547
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,197
was a big, huge sewing kit.

548
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,282
I'm not a sewer.

549
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,492
I'm not a seamstress.

550
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,284
I have no idea

551
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,577
what I could do with it.

552
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,662
Buttons, and a jar.

553
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,454
We can do something

554
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,205
with this jar.

555
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,039
>> This here, you...

556
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,207
That's is going to be

557
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,208
our fishing line, right?

558
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,292
>> Yep, that little red, gold

559
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,293
stick.

560
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,461
>> I know I'm going to use

561
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,796
some of the line that we have

562
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,922
and some of the metal posts

563
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:05,506
that we have for fish hooks.

564
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,049
Slip off, whoever wants

565
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,717
to slip off,

566
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,802
whatnot, whatever, and, uh,

567
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,428
we'll get some of the minnows.

568
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,429
>> That sounds good.

569
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,639
>> Yeah, go get some minnows.

570
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,682
>> So we need to get

571
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,766
some wood up, too, before it

572
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,892
starts getting wet, 'cause it's

573
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,185
going to for sure rain.

574
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,436
It rains every afternoon here.

575
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,729
The win today definitely gave

576
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,064
us a huge momentum boost.

577
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,399
We still got a few things

578
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,274
to do, though.

579
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,734
There's a lot of stuff right now

580
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,610
that's not done

581
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,736
that we need to do,

582
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,320
so I'm just kind of like, if I

583
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,239
gotta do it, then I'll do it.

584
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,206
>> It's not much,

585
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:45,170
but I think they'll like it.

586
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,715
>> What are we going to do,

587
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,050
just sit here?

588
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:55,472
>> Looks like everybody died.

589
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,432
>> I'm very disappointed

590
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,766
in my tribe right now.

591
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,934
I mean, there's little things

592
00:16:59,017 --> 00:16:59,393
that have to be done.

593
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,437
I'm not going to wait for

594
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,688
everybody to have a group

595
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,772
meeting.

596
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,898
Let's decide.

597
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,024
Well, we need to decide

598
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,942
and that's time,

599
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,485
and time's wasting.

600
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,195
>> Oh, so close.

601
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,697
>> You know, the first few days,

602
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,698
it was fine.

603
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,282
I like doing stuff for people.

604
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,367
But, man, they're going to let

605
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,577
you do everything out here

606
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,953
if you keep on doing it.

607
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,537
( stick thudding on coconuts )

608
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,456
>> Goodness.

609
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,957
( thudding )

610
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,291
There you go.

611
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,501
>> Especially Kim, I don't think

612
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,544
she understands

613
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,879
the value of work.

614
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,005
There's lots and lots of work

615
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,006
to do.

616
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,175
She doesn't really see that.

617
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,968
>> Are you tired?

618
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:33,969
>> No.

619
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:34,386
>> Are you crazy?

620
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,722
>> Yeah.

621
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,223
>> Bobby Jon really works his

622
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,642
booty off, almost to the point

623
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,727
where we are constantly

624
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,771
telling him to sit down,

625
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,147
you need to chill out.

626
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,691
I think he's playing his cards

627
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,359
in the beginning to be safe

628
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,694
and cement his place into the

629
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,446
group, and he'll be of no use

630
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,364
if, you know, he keeps doing

631
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,033
this for two weeks and, like,

632
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,243
crashes and burns.

633
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,546
>> We all took a walk down the

634
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,757
beach and spotted a couple

635
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,510
of banded sea snakes.

636
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,844
It's definitely a sea krait,

637
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,012
so just be careful.

638
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,263
They are very venomous, one of

639
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,556
the most venomous snakes

640
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,891
there is.

641
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,350
We're hungry,

642
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,478
and it was a big motivation.

643
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,771
The plan was to just

644
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,147
pin it down, hold it down

645
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,148
and then lop off its head.

646
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:28,690
Okay, I can take one chop

647
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,442
and be done.

648
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,944
>> They are poisonous snakes.

649
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:32,528
They're very poisonous snakes,

650
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,446
and they can cause cardiac

651
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,239
arrest, coma...

652
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,449
they can cause death, um,

653
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,575
with just one bite.

654
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,993
Ready?

655
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,246
>> Go.

656
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:42,663
>> Chop the snake!

657
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,164
Chop the snake!

658
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,290
>> We got him.

659
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:45,833
>> Keep going.

660
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,792
>> Sorry, buddy.

661
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,709
I'm sorry, buddy.

662
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,961
>> Ian chopped

663
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,920
the snake's head off.

664
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:50,921
He was so cute.

665
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:51,547
Like the whole time, he's all,

666
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,339
"Sorry, buddy, sorry, man.

667
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,299
Just got to do it, man, sorry."

668
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:54,550
( yells )

669
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,094
>> Okay, here's dinner.

670
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,262
>> You know, I work with

671
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,555
dolphins.

672
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,597
I love animals,

673
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,265
so to just kill a snake outright

674
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,350
and in cold blood wasn't for me.

675
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,936
So, I did feel bad.

676
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,521
>> Oh, no!

677
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,522
>> Koror!

678
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,023
Even without a head,

679
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,108
I'm still not convinced

680
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,860
he isn't going to bite me.

681
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,402
>> I was going to head back

682
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,237
with Katie and Jenn

683
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,864
to start the fire.

684
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,948
Tom and Ian, they found

685
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:18,782
three more snakes, and

686
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,908
they're, like, "Let's get these

687
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,659
while we can."

688
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,661
>> Nice little hari-kari stroke.

689
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,328
>> Are you ready? One...

690
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,415
>> Make it hard.

691
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,375
One, two, three.

692
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,334
>> He against the wall?

693
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:29,626
You got him?

694
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,419
>> Yeah, I got him pinned.

695
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,296
>> So he'll come out to fight.

696
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,380
When his head comes out,

697
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,381
man, lop it off.

698
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,215
There it is. There it is.

699
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,258
Get that head.

700
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,010
>> You got him?

701
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:38,385
>> We got him.

702
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,803
>> Got him?

703
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,846
>> That's it, Gregg.

704
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,389
>> Look, he's got something in

705
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,849
him, too, right, he just ate.

706
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,142
>> That's what we saw.

707
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:45,934
>> So it was maybe

708
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,518
a little foolhardy,

709
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,936
a little sense of adventure,

710
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,228
but, um...

711
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,313
obviously I've hooked up

712
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,232
with two other knuckleheads

713
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,776
who, uh, take fun in the

714
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,404
excitement of things like this.

715
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,405
And we're through.

716
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,531
>> Yes!

717
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,075
>> Ah!

718
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,952
We kind of let the carcasses

719
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,997
of the snakes hang out,

720
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,206
but as soon as we hung them

721
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:08,790
from the tree over the water,

722
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,000
we also noticed

723
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:10,417
that a young shark

724
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,628
came swimming and kept making

725
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,046
closer passes to it.

726
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,047
>> Oh, there it is.

727
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,048
That thing right there.

728
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:16,465
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,009
You know it might be the blood

730
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,010
from the snakes dripping

731
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,178
in the water.

732
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,179
We kind of got interested

733
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:22,721
that maybe we could trade

734
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,182
our snake with a shark.

735
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:25,599
>> A few of 'em...

736
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,476
>> If I saw a shark at Jones

737
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,269
Beach on Long Island,

738
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,312
we would all be running

739
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,313
out of the water.

740
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,024
We see a shark fin go by here,

741
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,192
everybody runs into the water

742
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:35,776
with sticks in their hands.

743
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,401
>> Probably the stupidest thing

744
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,862
I've done in a while, but...

745
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,696
>> You know,

746
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,114
the motivation is there;

747
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:46,203
we have to get food in us.

748
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:46,578
>> See 'em?

749
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,746
>> They see it.

750
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,999
Yup, they're coming closer.

751
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,167
>> Oh, my gosh.

752
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,919
>> Oh, my friggin' gosh.

753
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,003
>> You think they're interested

754
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,587
in that?

755
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,965
>> Let's see if we can, uh...

756
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,049
They got, they got...

757
00:20:59,132 --> 00:20:59,841
They keep getting...

758
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,676
Oh, here comes on.

759
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,677
Okay, here comes one.

760
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,220
Don't move. Don't move.

761
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,721
There he is. There he is.

762
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,974
Holy... Oh, he saw me.

763
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,058
>> Gosh, he came so close.

764
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,017
>> Hey, Jenn, you want

765
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:09,893
to chop up some more,

766
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:10,936
some more snake?

767
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:11,937
They really were close.

768
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,105
They were wily.

769
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,439
Close enough to make you

770
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,524
nervous, like, they come

771
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,275
straight at you and make you a

772
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,568
little bit heebie-jeebie.

773
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,653
Yeah, that's good stuff.

774
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,404
Nice and bloody.

775
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,863
Oh, that's nice and bloody.

776
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,364
>> It's a game of survival

777
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,323
as well as strategy,

778
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,034
and the survival aspect of it

779
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,743
is more real

780
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,786
than I ever imagined,

781
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,329
and also, the thought of having

782
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,497
shark steaks on a frying pan

783
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,666
is the motivation that takes

784
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,334
you past the fear of a shark.

785
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,919
>> There he is.

786
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,545
Oh, my gosh, he's right there.

787
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,589
Uh, two.

788
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,424
Two left.

789
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,341
Oh, man.

790
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,884
There's three of them around.

791
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,346
Bam! Bam! He took it.

792
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,641
Got really close.

793
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,350
>> They would get to just out

794
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,269
of reach of us.

795
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,770
I took a lunge at one

796
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,646
and missed,

797
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,023
but they knew we were there,

798
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,566
and would just probe so far,

799
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,984
but no closer.

800
00:21:59,067 --> 00:21:59,985
We had sharpened sticks,

801
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,319
which I don't think would

802
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:01,903
really go through shark skin.

803
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,571
He's big enough to put a

804
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,572
hurting on you, that guy.

805
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,323
>> Yeah.

806
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,450
We're going to back off the...

807
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,994
the snakes and redouble our

808
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:09,911
effort on the sharks,

809
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,247
I think is our plan right now.

810
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:31,391
We're going to get a shark.

811
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,477
>> Ow.

812
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,270
Going out to use the little

813
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,147
boys' room real quick,

814
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,398
and came walking down the beach,

815
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,859
stepped on a loose coconut.

816
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,568
Just my luck, rolled it on my

817
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,613
ankle that I had problems with

818
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,906
last year.

819
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,032
I'm just going to try

820
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:47,574
and keep it up right now.

821
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,408
Hopefully,

822
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,452
get all the fluids out of it.

823
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,661
Maybe wake up in the morning

824
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,579
and be a new man.

825
00:22:52,662 --> 00:23:13,016
Let's hope.

826
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,059
>> What's up, buddy?

827
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:14,518
>> How you doing?

828
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,561
>> Pretty good. How are you?

829
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:21,525
>> I'm all right.

830
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,152
Making yourself a diaper?

831
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:24,528
Be careful, buddy.

832
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,613
You might be piercing something

833
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,906
you don't want to pierce.

834
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,532
You need help, but I'm not going

835
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,574
to help you.

836
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,743
>> Right, right, right, right.

837
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,829
No, it's all good.

838
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,626
>> There's a lot on my mind

839
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:39,960
this morning.

840
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,837
Got a lack of sleep last night

841
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,754
because of my ankle.

842
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,505
I tried to keep it elevated

843
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,966
throughout the night,

844
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:46,508
but the pain is still there,

845
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,634
so I'm going to try

846
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,678
and take it easy today

847
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,388
and, you know, I want to try

848
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,305
and save my energy

849
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,015
until maybe our next challenge

850
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,978
so that I can do my best.

851
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,486
>> We got a challenge.

852
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,281
>> We got a challenge?

853
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,282
>> Yeah.

854
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:10,824
>> How's your ankle feel?

855
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,325
>> Horrible.

856
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,994
>> Horrible?

857
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:14,578
>> "The weight of the weak lay

858
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,580
on the shoulders of the strong.

859
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,581
Today's challenge will show you

860
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,375
where in the tribe you belong.

861
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,002
'Can I go any further?'

862
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:22,669
You may have reasonable doubt,

863
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,713
but let your tribe down, tonight

864
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,508
your torch could go out."

865
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,135
>> We got tree mail, and it was

866
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,553
the one tree mail that's talking

867
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,721
about pure strength,

868
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,223
and I've got it.

869
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:35,724
I just, at this point,

870
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,643
hope to God I can use it.

871
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,936
It's totally my luck.

872
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,521
I hurt my ankle, and we think

873
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:41,938
we have a challenge

874
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,399
in a couple days, but we have it

875
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,609
the very next morning.

876
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,735
If I mess up today,

877
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,904
it's on my shoulders.

878
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,696
I want to win this challenge

879
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,116
more than I've wanted anything.

880
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,492
I want to carry this tribe

881
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,452
all the way

882
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,536
to the end of this game,

883
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,121
and I'm going to do anything

884
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,373
I can to do that.

885
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,094
>> PROBST: All right,

886
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,262
first things first.

887
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:14,554
Willard...

888
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,307
Take back immunity.

889
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,768
Immunity back up for grabs.

890
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,144
Before we get to the challenge,

891
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,312
I got to ask, Jeff--

892
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,271
you were hobbling in here.

893
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:23,897
What happened?

894
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,190
>> I rolled it last night

895
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,441
in the middle of the night

896
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,984
on a coconut, and heard a snap,

897
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:28,777
crackle, pop.

898
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,320
And I'm just trying to take care

899
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,613
of it right now the best I can.

900
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,614
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

901
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,156
ready for today's challenge?

902
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,407
>> Yeah.

903
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,325
>> PROBST: It is for immunity.

904
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,284
Here's how it works:

905
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:36,910
You're each going

906
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,161
to be wearing a belt.

907
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:38,703
That belt will be clipped

908
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,788
to a common rope,

909
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,957
so you will move together

910
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,832
as a tribe.

911
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,209
In addition,

912
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,502
you'll be carrying a backpack

913
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,254
with 20 pounds of sand in it.

914
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,338
Starting on opposite sides

915
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,673
of an oval course,

916
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,466
you will race, trying to catch

917
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,842
the other tribe.

918
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,344
If a tribe member gets tired,

919
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:54,928
and they want out, they can

920
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,720
opt out of the challenge,

921
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,347
but they have

922
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,847
to take their weight off

923
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,599
and give it to another

924
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,600
tribe member, then unclip.

925
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,643
So they're out of the challenge,

926
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,603
but the weight is still

927
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,521
in the challenge.

928
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,272
Somebody will have

929
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,356
to carry that burden.

930
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:06,982
First tribe to catch the other

931
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,816
tribe and touch one

932
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,818
of their tribe members

933
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,735
wins immunity--

934
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,989
doesn't go to Tribal Council.

935
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:14,739
For the losers,

936
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,323
somebody going home tonight.

937
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:15,699
Big enough stakes?

938
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,658
>> Yeah.

939
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,451
>> Oh, yeah.

940
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,411
>> PROBST: Koror, you still

941
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,287
have two extra members.

942
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,788
You're sitting two people out.

943
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,831
Who's sitting out?

944
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,248
>> Jenn and Janu.

945
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:23,790
>> Jenn and Janu.

946
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,667
>> PROBST: Jenn and Janu are

947
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,710
sitting out.

948
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,003
Everybody else, take your spots,

949
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,006
wait for my go.

950
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,758
Here we go, for immunity.

951
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,303
Survivors ready.

952

Go!

953
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,138
Right away,

954
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,973
Jeff gets rid of his weight.

955
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,391
He's unclipping.

956
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,143
Can't run on that ankle.

957
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,227
Going to take strength

958
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,729
and strategy to win this.

959
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:51,359

960
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,361
>> Faster, Caryn.

961
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:58,116

962
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,285
>> Somebody's down.

963

>> PROBST: Caryn's down.

964
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,288
She gives her weight to Tom,

965
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,623
and she's unclipping.

966
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,750
Tom is now carrying 40 pounds.

967
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,960

Willard's out of the race.

971
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,721
He gives his weight to Gregg.

972
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,890
>> I can't do it.

973
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,101
>> Give me the belt!

974
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,186
>> PROBST: Kim falls down.

975
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,064
She's out.

She gives her weight

977
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:30,315

978
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,983
He's now carrying

986
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:46,790
in this challenge.

987
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,249
It is very hot out.

988
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,960
Heat really taking its toll.

989
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,761
>> Coby, dig deep, will ya?

990
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,973
Come on!

991

Coby trying to keep up.

1001
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,077
>> Yo, they're going to catch us

1002
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,744
if we don't jog.

1003
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,579
>> No they're not.

1004
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,205
>> Yes they are, they're getting

1005
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,373
close.

1006
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,707

in a full-on sprint,

1017
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,939
carrying a lot of weight.

1018
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,023
Steph showing no signs

1019
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,733
of slowing down.

1020
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,235
All right, let's have a burst

1021
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,278
or something.

1022
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,362
No one's holding us back,

1023
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,029
all right?

1024
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,074
We hit the shallows, we dash.

1025
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:03,700
>> Just think

1026
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,200
of Tribal Council, guys.

1027
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,035

>> Wear them down, guys!

1035
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,215
Wear them down.

Come on. In front of me!

1037

Ulong.

1044
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:34,647
That kicks Ulong into gear.

1045
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,107
>> Come on! Come on!

1046
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:36,774

Come on.

1053
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,912
>> They're wearing out.

1054
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,330
Look at them-- they can't even

1055
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,664
go through the shallows that

1056
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:51,873
fast.

1057
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:52,999
We can, so let's do it.

1058
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,918
>> PROBST: Ulong really slowing

1059
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,044

Bobby Jon now with 80 pounds.

1063
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,258
The longer this challenge goes,

1064
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,052
the deeper the water is getting.

1065
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,554
The tide is coming in.

1066
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,565
We're down to three on three.

1067
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,066
It's Tom, Gregg and Ian

1068
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,151
for Koror.

1069
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,945
Really closing the gap.

to kick it into gear.

1074

Do they have anything left

1075
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,663
in the tank?

1076
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,664
Ulong's been to two

1077
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,373
straight Tribal Councils.

1078
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,999
Doesn't want to go back again.

1079
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,334
>> I think we have to jog.

1080

>> PROBST: Koror has yet to go

1081
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:38,253
to Tribal Council, and

1082
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:46,386
there's no rush to get there.

1083
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:52,892
Koror making a move.

1084
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,062
Bobby Jon now takes the lead.

1085
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,897
>> Let's do it, guys.

1086
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,607
Burst. Little burst.

1087
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,191
>> PROBST: Koror is making up

closing the gap

1090
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,947
slowly but surely.

1091
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,365
Steph looking over her shoulder

1092
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,117
as Koror gets closer and closer.

1093
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,245
Does Ulong have anything left?

1094
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,414
>> Go, guys! Koror! Whoo!

1095
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,373
>> PROBST: Koror is making

1096

Ulong very close to going back

1098
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,795
to Tribal Council.

1099
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,965
Immunity at stake!

1100
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,049

with you guys.

1108
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,149
No Tribal Council,

1109
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,525
safe from another vote.

1110
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,610
Ulong, sadly, you're getting

1111
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,779
all too familiar

1112
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,196
with Tribal Council.

1113
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,990
Tonight, you will return

1114
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,074
and vote out yet another member

1115
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,743
from your tribe.

1116
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,954
Head on back to camp.

1117
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,642
>> All right, everybody,

1118
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,267
I want to talk to all you guys.

1119
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,227
First all, I think everybody

1120
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,646
tried their heart out today.

1121
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,730
I'm really sorry that

1122
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,982
I couldn't help participate.

1123
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,193
But I know there's no possible

1124
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,362
way that I can get to the end

1125
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,154
with a busted-up ankle,

1126
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,781
especially in these conditions.

1127
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,240
I know, myself, in three weeks,

1128
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,283
my ankle may start

1129
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,451
getting better.

1130
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,869
>> Really?

1131
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:35,578
>> In these conditions.

1132
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,204
I'm not, I mean...

1133
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,205
>> You don't even think,

1134
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:37,705
like, a couple of days...?

1135
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,289
>> To tell you the truth...

1136
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,375
There's no way.

1137
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,459
I can barely put

1138
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,002
any weight on it right now

1139
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,087
without clenching my teeth.

1140
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,880
Like, every time I step,

1141
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,382
I feel like a tear is going

1142
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,091
to come out of my eye.

1143
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,385
If I stay in here, you guys

1144
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,136
aren't gonna get to the end.

1145
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,429
>> I don't want you

1146
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,305
to leave here, though,

1147
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,598
and in two days your ankle

1148
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,391
will be feeling fine

1149
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,809
and us be like...

1150
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,352
>> So we're going to vote out

1151
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,728
someone else instead?

1152
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,813
There's no reason to

1153
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,357
vote off anybody else.

1154
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:04,607
All right?

1155
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,111
>> Yeah, we want you to stay.

1156
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,822
>> Soon as we got back to the

1157
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,782
beach, old Jeff said, "Guys,

1158
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,159
you need to vote me off."

1159
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,452
Oh, we were sad, you know.

1160
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,995
We didn't want to vote him out.

1161
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,872
He's strong, you know, he does a

1162
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,499
lot around here, you know?

1163
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,042
And the person we were planning

1164
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,085
on voting out, which is Kim,

1165
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,838
does hardly anything.

1166
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,463
>> We vote Jeff off, it's going

1167
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,465
to be like two people gone

1168
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,591
anyway, 'cause she ain't did

1169
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,759
none of the challenges.

1170
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,802
She ain't do nothing

1171
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,678
around the camp.

1172
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,721
>> Yeah, she's down there laying

1173
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,513
up, ain't doing nothing

1174
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,222
down there.

1175
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,181
>> She's so happy 'cause she

1176
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,057
thinks she's okay tonight.

1177
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,892
>> That boy's tough.

1178
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,643
>> Yeah, I'd rather,

1179
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,854
nurture him and feed him.

1180
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:43,646
I feel very strongly

1181
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,439
that Jeff should stay.

1182
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,523
We should get rid

1183
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,066
of Kim for sure tonight.

1184
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,360
Jeff's weakness is our strength.

1185
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,153
Even when he's down, he's ten

1186
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,613
times stronger than Kim.

1187
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,990
I'm definitely going to go talk

1188
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,116
with other people in the tribe

1189
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,827
and see what they think.

1190
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,786
>> Bobby Jon, I don't

1191
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,871
know about you,

1192
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,414
but just to let you know,

1193
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,624
I'm voting for Jeff.

1194
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,625
>> You are?

1195
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,209
>> Oh, yeah.

1196
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,795
I planed on voting for Jeff

1197
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,921
as soon as he hurt his ankle.

1198
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,131
>> Okay.

1199
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,507
>> And I'm not swaying from it.

1200
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,134
>> Okay, cool.

1201
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,136
Well, I ain't voting for him,

1202
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,763
'cause I'm voting for Kim,

1203
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,805
because I'll be danged

1204
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,389
if I'm going to feed somebody

1205
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,516
when they don't do nothing.

1206
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,684
>> Yeah.

1207
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,310
Some of the other tribe members

1208
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,227
want to vote off Kim,

1209
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,270
and I can see that

1210
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,146
because she didn't really

1211
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,523
do much, but I'm kind of hoping

1212
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,900
once Jeff goes

1213
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,401
she'll start maybe doing

1214
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,486
a little bit more instead

1215
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,279
of just thinking about Jeff.

1216
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,280
>> Yes!

1217
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:34,530
Check it.

1218
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,281
Hey, I can cut them

1219
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,408
right in half with one cut.

1220
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,201
>> Watch this.

1221
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,160
You watching?

1222
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,119
>> What are they doing?

1223
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:40,953
>> Come here, come here,

1224
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,996
come here, come here.

1225
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,122
Come here... come here!

1226
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,582
>> What's he cutting, coconuts?

1227
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,666
>> Just watch. Just watch.

1228
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,418
Watch, watch.

1229
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,419
>> Yes!

1230
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,337
>> You're just doing it

1231
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,379
to be a bad ass now.

1232
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,380
>> Now I am. Heck, yeah.

1233
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,465
>> She can't do that, okay?

1234
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,716
>> Okay.

1235
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,176
>> She's gone.

1236
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,012
Or is he going?

1237
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:58,346
Still tough?

1238
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,848
>> Still tough.

1239
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,103
We'll see.

1240
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,270
>> Perfect day to leave.

1241
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,147
Beautiful, warm.

1242
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,649
>> We need you.

1243
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,900
>> I know what you're saying,

1244
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:11,859
but just let me enjoy this

1245
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,777
one day.

1246
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,945
>> It's not logical

1247
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,071
to get rid of you.

1248
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:15,530
I think you're afraid

1249
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,532
that somebody else is going

1250
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,783
to get voted off.

1251
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,283
>> Huh?

1252
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,368
>> Well, it is

1253
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,495
right before Tribal,

1254
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,621
and, of course, people

1255
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,498
are whispering,

1256
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,707
and I don't know what

1257
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,667
conversations are taking place.

1258
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,709
They could be all

1259
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,919
be over there conspiring

1260
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,003
and, "We're not

1261
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,088
going to vote for him.

1262
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:32,713
We'll see what his ankle does."

1263
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,465
>> That's cool.

1264
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,967
>> I think that's cool.

1265
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,134
>> I'm feeling vulnerable.

1266
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,803
I mean, there's no way of

1267
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,054
telling what could happen.

1268
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:40,847
I definitely think

1269
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,722
there's a chance that

1270
00:35:41,806 --> 00:36:02,743
Jeff could be here tomorrow.

1271
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,161
>> PROBST: You guys got to be

1272
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,413
getting tired of seeing me here.

1273
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,373
>> Oh, we're tired of it.

1274
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,040
Very tired.

1275
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,708
>> PROBST: Ibrehem.

1276
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,417
Three immunity challenges,

1277
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,626
three losses.

1278
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,128
After tonight,

1279
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,004
three tribe members gone.

1280
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:13,796
Koror still

1281
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,047
standing strong at nine.

1282
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,716
Gotta be a little frustrating

1283
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,800
to continually get pummeled

1284
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,511
in these challenges.

1285
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,263
>> Uh, it is very frustrating,

1286
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,389
but honestly, today,

1287
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,515
I know if we would have

1288
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,683
had one person in there

1289
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,601
who we really needed,

1290
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,476
we would have won.

1291
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:27,977
>> PROBST: You're saying

1292
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,812
if you had Jeff

1293
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,980
you'd have won the challenge?

1294
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,064
>> I'm saying, if we would

1295
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:32,982
have had Jeff, we would

1296
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:33,733
have won the challenge.

1297
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,525
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon.

1298
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,693
Jeff really

1299
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,153
the difference in this?

1300
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:37,570
>> No, he wasn't.

1301
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,196
The difference was,

1302
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,908
is-is Tom for Koror is what the

1303
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,283
difference is.

1304
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,492
He's a man.

1305
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,869
He's a man among men,

1306
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,620
and he single-handedly

1307
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,370
whipped us, I think, today,

1308
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,371
to be honest with you.

1309
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,248
>> PROBST: Ibrehem, you're

1310
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:49,624
shaking your head.

1311
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,333
>> I don't think Tom

1312
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,043
single-handedly beat us.

1313
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,085
Him and his team did it

1314
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:53,419
together.

1315
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,463
We did good, but after

1316
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,797
a while, you know, Bobby Jon

1317
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,798
had 80 pounds on him.

1318
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,050
We just needed that extra man,

1319
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,885
and that's just point-blank

1320
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,094
what it was.

1321
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,095
>> PROBST: Steph.

1322
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,263
How long after getting back

1323
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,223
from the challenge

1324
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,683
did the finger-pointing begin?

1325
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,643
>> When we got back,

1326
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,977
actually, Jeff sat us all down

1327
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,020
and he just pretty much said

1328
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,104
that he's really

1329
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,147
hurting right now and he

1330
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,148
doesn't know how much use

1331
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,399
he's going to be to the tribe.

1332
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,484
No one really got a chance

1333
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,318
to point fingers.

1334
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,319
He just gave us a lot to think

1335
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,738
about coming into Tribal Council

1336
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,324
tonight.

1337
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,116
>> PROBST: Jeff, you got

1338
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,409
the weirdest look on your face.

1339
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,410
You're smiling.

1340
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,578
>> You know what?

1341
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,246
Jeff, I've always been a team

1342
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:29,830
player my entire life, and I

1343
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,414
really think that I screwed up

1344
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,334
my ankle, and it was a deathful

1345
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,713
thing for me as well as my team.

1346
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,173
I'm not saying that we would've

1347
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,675
have won today had I been there,

1348
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,926
but I know that we would

1349
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:42,969
have had a better chance.

1350
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,261
That would have been 20 pounds

1351
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,054
off one of these guys' backs.

1352
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,138
>> PROBST: What's your point?

1353
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,014
>> My point is that I want to be

1354
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,641
able to help the tribe

1355
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,308
in any way possible,

1356
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,226
and at this point,

1357
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,852
right this second, I can't.

1358
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,187
I can't do anything.

1359
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,188
>> PROBST: Ibrehem.

1360
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,481
What are the other reasons

1361
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,607
that you're starting to notice

1362
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,692
about why you might

1363
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,859
vote people out?

1364
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,611
Is it to a point now where

1365
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,029
you're starting to notice who

1366
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:02,613
really is doing the work you

1367
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,366
need versus who is starting to

1368
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,367
say, "You know, we're okay.

1369
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,410
I think I can take

1370
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:07,868
a nap this afternoon"?

1371
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,662
>> I think everybody works hard,

1372
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:13,040
but sometimes

1373
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,208
people might get a little tired

1374
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,167
and might not want

1375
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:15,668
to put in as much effort

1376
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,378
as everybody else.

1377
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,005
>> PROBST: But when it comes to

1378
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,047
voting somebody out of the

1379
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:20,840
game...

1380
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:21,882
>> That can play

1381
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,009
a big part in it.

1382
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,552
That can play a big part,

1383
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,386
in my opinion.

1384
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,054
>> PROBST: Kim, you seem

1385
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:27,555
very frustrated tonight.

1386
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,431
>> It's not that I'm frustrated.

1387
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,390
I mean, I'll admit to you, it's

1388
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,851
it's hard being on this team

1389
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,019
when you have these guys

1390
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,438
that are super-strong and tons

1391
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,398
of stamina and workaholics.

1392
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:37,815
Like, I could never

1393
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,358
measure up to Bobby Jon.

1394
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,401
I mean, he's freaking Tarzan.

1395
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,569
And it's frustrating losing.

1396
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,448
I'm so sick of being here.

1397
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,532
I'll be honest with you,

1398
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,658
if he wasn't going home

1399
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,075
then I would know

1400
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,493
that I was one of the people

1401
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,578
on the cutting block,

1402
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,121
chopping block, whatever,

1403
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,665
because our tribe's obviously

1404
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,542
manifested itself to be a tribe

1405
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,043
that the strongest stay

1406
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,294
and the weakest go,

1407
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,420
and it's not that I'm weaker

1408
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,504
than the average person,

1409
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,174
it just means in this tribe,

1410
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,341
that might be where I fall.

1411
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:04,759
>> PROBST: James.

1412
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,551
>> Yeah.

1413
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,386
>> PROBST: At any time today

1414
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,929
was there any dilemma,

1415
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:09,430
"Do we give him his wish

1416
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,432
or do we keep him"?

1417
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,892
>> Yeah, there's been a dilemma.

1418
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,560
We've been debating all day long

1419
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,188
on whether or not to keep Jeff

1420
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,564
or let him have his way,

1421
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:18,939
and we're probably

1422
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,317
still debating.

1423
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:21,859
It's just running through

1424
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,903
our head, you know.

1425
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,487
We don't even know what we're

1426
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,488
going to do until we do it.

1427
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,573
>> PROBST: Clearly this tribe

1428
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,075
has not yet made up its mind.

1429
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:29,784
Let's see which way

1430
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,534
you're going to go.

1431
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,535
It is time to vote.

1432
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:40,127
James, you're up.

1433
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,881
>> Kim... you are lazy.

1434
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:44,507
You don't do anything.

1435
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,258
You get out

1436
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,802
of the race a day early.

1437
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,096
You are not a helper.

1438
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:02,900
>> You've become one

1439
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:03,567
of my greatest friends

1440
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,903
on this island.

1441
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,613
I'm happy I got to know you, but

1442
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,156
this is what you wanted,

1443
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,367
so this what is I'm going to do.

1444
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,254
>> Everything's fine, but

1445
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,797
tonight I'm not going to play

1446
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,090
you and Jeff's

1447
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,259
little silly-ass game.

1448
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,723
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1449
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,851
votes.

1450
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:47,987
Once the votes are read,

1451
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,779
the decision is final.

1452
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,196
The person voted out

1453
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,697
will be asked to leave

1454
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,407
the Tribal Council

1455
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:51,991
area immediately.

1456
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,368
I'll read the votes.

1457
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:56,954
First vote.

1458
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:00,875
Jeff.

1459
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,042
Jeff.

1460
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,422
Two votes Jeff.

1461
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:10,384
James.

1462
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,094
Kim.

1463
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:12,845
Two votes Jeff,

1464
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,640
one vote James, one vote Kim.

1465
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:16,974
Kim.

1466
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,726
That's two votes Kim.

1467
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,730
Two votes Jeff, one vote James.

1468
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,398
Jeff.

1469
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:26,233
We're three votes Jeff,

1470
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,027
two votes Kim, one vote James.

1471
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,572
I'll read the last vote.

1472
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,656
Third person voted out

1473
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,949
of<i> Survivor: Palau.</i>

1474
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,075
Jeff.

1475
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,661
You need to bring me your torch.

1476
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,792
>> Kill Koror.

1477
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,085
>> PROBST: Jeff,

1478
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,254
the tribe has spoken.

1479
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,381
Time to go.

1480
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,809
You had a tough

1481
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,810
first eight days.

1482
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,270
So the question is, how

1483
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,481
do you turn tonight's vote

1484
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,941
into something positive?

1485
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,108
Grab your torches,

1486
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,151
head back to camp.

1487
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,237
Good night.

1488
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,165
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1489
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,042
from our next episode.

1490
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,796
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1491
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,714
>> I've never lost this

1492
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,966
bad in my entire life.

1493
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:32,675
>> PROBST: Ulong gets desperate.

1494
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,969
>> Don't freak out.

1495
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,387
>> PROBST: And the tribes have a

1496
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,012
big decision to make.

1497
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:37,763
>> "Choose one tribal

1498
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:38,097
representative

1499
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,307
to make some important choices."

1500
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,850
>> What if the person who goes

1501
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,144
doesn't get to come back?

1502
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,229
>> PROBST: You have not picked

1503
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,481
a representative yet?

1504
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,737
>> There is a huge part

1505
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,905
of me that wishes

1506
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,698
that I had not injured myself

1507
00:42:55,781 --> 00:43:00,160
to the point of being unable

1508
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:00,995
to help my team

1509
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:01,870
advance in the game,

1510
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,871
and it was my choice,

1511
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:03,163
and I know

1512
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,832
that by making that choice,

1513
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,084
my team is going to be able

1514
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:07,835
to advance further

1515
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,877
in the game.

1516
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:09,628
Ulong, it's time

1517
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,673
to take Koror to the cleaner.
