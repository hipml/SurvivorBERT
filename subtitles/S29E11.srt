00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,799
>> Jeff: JACLYN, HARD?

378
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,134
>> YEAH, BUT I SAW IT COMING.

379
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,219
THOSE THREE ARE TIGHT.

380
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:18,803
>> Jeff: A MOMENT AGO IT WAS A

381
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,845
HAPPY FIVE, SO HAPPY YOU SAID

382
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,722

WHO PROBABLY DON'T LIKE YOU VERY

387
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:29,522
MUCH.

388
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,189
>> WE LIKE HER A LOT.

389
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,023
>> I'M SURE YOU DO.

390
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,858

00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,028
BAYLOR.

393
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:36,946
YOU'RE A BRAT.

394
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,489
>> EXCUSE ME?

395
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,865
DID YOU JUST CALL HER A BRAT?

396
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,784
>> SHE'S BEING A BRAT.

397
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,035
>> WOW.

>> SURE.

401
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,708
THAT'S MY KID.

402
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,421
>> I KNOW IT'S YOUR KID.

403
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,964
>> SHE'S NOT A GIRL, SHE'S A

404
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:55,131
MOM.

405
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,257
>> THAT'S FINE, I UNDERSTAND

406
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,174
SHE'S YOUR MOM.

407
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,385
BUT YOU'RE-- HOW OLD ARE YOU,

408
00:11:59,468 --> 00:11:59,718
20-SOMETHING?

409
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,719
IF YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A BRAT,

410
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,929
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, YOU'RE

411
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:02,888
BEING A BRAT RIGHT NOW.

412
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,389
>> REED.

413
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:03,889
>> MISSY.

414
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,015
>> YOU'VE BEEN AFTER EVERYBODY

415
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,350
IN THIS GAME--

416
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,935
>> HOW HAVE I BEEN AFTER

417
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,185
EVERYONE.

418
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,020
>> WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN FOR ONE

419
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,230
ONCE, SHUT YOUR MOUTH FOR ONCE

420
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,148
AND I WILL TELL YOU.

421
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,983
I HAVE HAD YOUR BACK MULTIPLE

422
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,150
TIMES.

423
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,525
>> YOU HAVE NOT.

424
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,193
>> YOU LIED TO MY FACE.

425
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:16,819
>> IT'S THE GAME, OF COURSE, I'M

426
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,654
GOING TO LIE TO YOU.

427
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,321
>> FORGET IT.

428
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,614
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

429
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:20,739
>>

430
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,157
>> Jeff: FORGET IT?

431
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,241
>> IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

432
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,075
HE CAN'T LISTEN.

433
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,285
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW.

434
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:24,910
>> Jeff: MISSY, BAYLOR,

435
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,705
NATALIE, HORSES BACK RIDING,

00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,039
RESORT, GREAT MEAL, GOOD NIGHT'S

SLEEP.

438
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,040
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, AND

439
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,002
ENJOY IT.

440
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,003
>> HANG IN THERE, OKAY?

441
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,588
>> OKAY.

442
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,798
>> COME ON, GIRLS.

443
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,300
>> OH, MY GOD.

444
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,051
>> Jeff: WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

445
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,262
>> I FEEL LIKE JON SACRIFICED

FOR OUR ALLIANCE, AND I GOT THE

447
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,348
BUTT END.

448
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:46,682
>> ABSOLUTELY.

449
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,767
>> AND THE THREE TOP PEOPLE JUST

450
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,019
WENT OFF TO GO HORSES BACK

451
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:50,227
RIDING.

452
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:50,811
THAT'S HONESTLY HOW I FEEL.

453
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,189
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JUST

454
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:53,481
HAPPENED.

455
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,064
>> THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD FEEL.

456
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,235
THEM THREE RIGHT THERE ARE

457
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,988
TIGHT.

458
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,407
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JACLYN,

459
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,658
ALEC, REED, KEITH, GOT NOTHING

460
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,576
FOR YOU.

461
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,285
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

462
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,036
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

463
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,871
>> IT WAS VERY TELLING.

464
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,997
MISSY CHOSE NATALIE.

465
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,665
THAT MAKES ME THINK THAT WHEN

466
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,626
ITS DOES DOES COME DOWN TO OUR

467
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,711
FIVE IT WOULD BE BAYLOR, MISSY,

468
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,712
AND NATALIE.

469
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,298
IT MAKES ME SECOND GUESS

470
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:19,673
EVERYTHING.

471
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,856
EXILE BECAUSE THERE WERE TWO

472
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,399
IDOLS PLAYED LAST NIGHT, AND

473
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,026
THERE WAS GOING TO BE A NEW CLUE

474
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,904
FOR A NEW IDOL, SO FINDING THIS

475
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,822
IDOL IS SOMETHING THAT'S

476
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,075
DEFINITELY GOING TO HELP ME.

477
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:46,700
"SIDEWAYS TREE MARKS THE WAY TO

478
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,120
THE TREASURE YOU CRAVE THE MOST.

479
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,040
IT'S A DRIER TREK AT LEAST TWICE

480
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,083
A DAY SO ENJOY A STROLL ALONG

481
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,709
THE COAST."

482
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,002
HAVING A LOT OF TIME ON EXILE

483
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,337
GIVES YOU A LOT OF TIME TO

484
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,214
THINK, AND RIGHT NOW, MY FEAR IN

485
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,006
THIS GAME IS THAT I'VE BECOME

486
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,425
THE BIGGEST THREAT, AND THAT'S

487
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,510
SCARY BECAUSE PEOPLE TRY TO GET

488
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,928
OUT THE LARGEST THREATS, SO I AM

489
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,931
NOT GOING TO STOP UNTIL I FIND

490
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:16,397
THE DANG THING.

491
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,690
"SIDEWAYS TREE MARKS THE WAY."

492
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,567
I'M LOOKING AROUND AND I SEE

493
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,526
CLIFFS ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND

494
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,736
THERE ARE TREES HANGING OFF OF

495
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,947
THEM, JUST SHOOTING OUT.

496
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,241
"IT'S A DRIER TREK AT LEAST

497
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,076
TWICE A DAY."

498
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:35,332
IT'S NOT DRY RIGHT NOW.

499
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,459
I SAW A BUNCH OF SIDEWAYS TREES,

500
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,085
AND I STARTED SEEING A LOT OF

501
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,421
CRACKS AND CREVICES.

502
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,423
SO I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW,

503
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,592
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE PERFECT

504
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:49,972
PLACE TO HIDE AN IDOL.

505
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,851
THERE'S THE TREE.

506
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:58,731
YES!

507
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,317
HA-HA-HA!

508
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,318
OH, MAN!

509
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,528
I LOVE THIS!

510
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,280
FINDING THIS IDOL IS SOMETHING

511
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:06,905
THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO HELP

512
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,074
ME AND REFOCUS ME EVEN MORE ON

513
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,869
JACLYN AND I'S FUTURE.

514
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:16,206
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

515
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,672
>> WHAT A PERFECT DAY!

516
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,090
>> THIS IS THE PERFECT REWARD

517
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
FOR US TO ENJOY TOGETHER.

518
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,053
RIDING HORSES WAS AMAZING.

519
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,973
ME GOT TO SEE NICARAGUA FROM

520
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:33,307
ANOTHER VIEW.

521
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,768
WE WEREN'T STUCK ON THE BEACH

522
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,018
ANYMORE.

523
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:36,518
WE WERE TAKING IT ALL IN.

524
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,187
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT.

525
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,021
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER FORGET

526
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,481
THE EXPERIENCE.

527
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,482
>> OH, MY GOD.

528
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,026
>> OH, MY GOD!

529
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,278
>> WE'RE AT A PALACE!

530
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,029
>> I WANT TO SEE THE FOOD AND

531
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,990
THE POOL!

532
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,117
THIS IS AMAZING.

533
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,118
SALAD, CHIPS, BEANS.

534
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,204
>> YOU GUYS, THIS IS

535
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:55,537
UNBELIEVABLE.

536
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,748
>> THIS IS AMAZING.

537
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,832
MISSY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

538
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,333
PICKING ME.

539
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,210
>> MOM, THANKS FOR TAKING YOUR

540
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:01,460
DAUGHTER.

541
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,087
>> TO HAVE BAYLOR AND ME

542
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,506
TOGETHER WAS FANTASTIC, AND TO

543
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,716
HAVE NATALIE ALONG WHO REALLY

544
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,759
ADOARS MY DAUGHTER AS A BIG

545
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,761
SISTER KIND OF TYPE, SHE'LL BE

546
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,721
LIKE A DAUGHTER TO ME FOREVER.

547
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,347
>> TO THE GIRLS.

548
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,265
>> I COULDN'T HAVE GONE ON THAT

549
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,058
REWARD WITH ANYBODY ELSE AND HAD

550
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,434
THAT SAME EXPERIENCE.

551
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,311
>> JACLYN IS SUCH A LITTLE

552
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,312
PRINCESS THAT YOU HAVE TO WORRY

553
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,189
ABOUT JACLYN'S FEELINGS WHEN

554
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:22,648
PICKING ME FOR REWARD.

555
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,734
>> SHE WILL FLIP.

556
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,819
THEY ARE PILING ON TONIGHT WITH

557
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:27,736
RIDE, I KNOW THEY ARE.

558
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,405
>> IF JACLYN TELLS JON TO COME

559
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,407
OVER WITH THEM, THEN WE'RE IN

560
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,615
TROUBLE.

561
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,700
THIS WAS THE MOST AMAZING

562
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,034
REWARD, BUT IT'S HARD TO HAVE A

563
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,161
GOOD TIME DAWES BECAUSE WE'RE

564
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,746
NERVOUS THAT JACLYN BEING BACK

565
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,372
AT CAMP WITH THESE THREE GUYS,

566
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,791
SHE COULD EASILY BE SWAYED AND

567
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,417
TOLD THINGS THAT WOULD CHANGE

568
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,752
HER MIND ABOUT HOW SHE FEELS

569
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,129
ABOUT MY MOM, ME, AND NATALIE.

570
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,089
>> OKAY, WE HAVE TO TALK TO YOU

571
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:47,715
ABOUT SOMETHING.

572
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:52,386
>> ME AND BAYLOR HAVE AN IDOL!

573
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,178
>> WE FOUND IT TWO DAYS AGO.

574
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,263
>> YOU LITTLE ( BLEEP ).

575
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,182
WHY DID YOU KEEP THIS FROM ME?

576
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,684
I'M PROUD OF MY DAUGHTER.

577
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,727
SHE FOUND AN IDOL.

578
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,769
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.

579
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,145
I WAS LIKE, WHAT?

580
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,022
TODAY PROVES TO ME THAT SHE'S

581
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,858
PLAYING THIS GAME, AND I'M GOING

582
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,609
TO PAT HER ON THE BUTT THE WHOLE

583
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:07,943
WAY THROUGH IT.

584
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,446
>> SO FINAL THREE, HOW WOULD YOU

585
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,572
GUYS FEEL ABOUT GOING TOGETHER?

586
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,614
>> I THINK THAT'S OKAY.

587
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,491
>> YOU THINK THAT'S OKAY?

588
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,117
>> I'D BE DOWN.

589
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,494
>> FINAL THREE WITH ME, BAYLOR,

590
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,621
AND MISSY WOULD BE A HANDS

591
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,205
PICKED TEAM.

592
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,290
I WOULD BE A SURE WIN IN MY

593
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,125
HEAD.

594
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:23,917
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN BUT I

595
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,878
WOULD BE COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE

596
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,546
GOING TO FINAL THREE WITH THEM.

597
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,548
DO YOU WANT TO SPLIT A BROWNIE?

598
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,009
>> I WANT A FULL ONE.

599
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:32,843
>> WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

600
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,220
>> I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN

601
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:35,471
MYSELF.

602
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,263
>> WAIT, WHY ARE YOU?

603
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,307
>> BECAUSE, I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET

604
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,433
BAYLOR GET A RISE OUT OF ME.

605
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,934
>> YEAH, SHE DID.

606
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,020
>> SHE DID, AND I JUST-- I

607
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:43,270
SNAPPED.

608
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:43,645
IT HAS NOTHING--

609
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,980
>> AND MISSY'S LIKE--

610
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,523
>> IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

611
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,524
GAME.

612
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,317
THAT'S NOT THE WAY I AM IN REAL

613
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,485
LIFE.

614
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,195
>> I DIDN'T THINK MISSY WAS

615
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,155
GOING TO TAKE NATALIE.

616
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:53,530
THINK ABOUT IT.

617
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,157
THAT'S NOT SMART.

618
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,451
JON JUST WENT TO EXILE, AND I'M

619
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:57,785
SITTING THERE.

620
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,744
>> YEAH.

621
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,579
>> MAYBE I'M JUST MAD RIGHT NOW.

622
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,247
IT'S JUST SO FUN THEY MISSY

623
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,373
WOULD PICK NATALIE.

624
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,333
LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS

625
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,044
THE SMARTEST MOVE ON MISSY'S

626
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,128
PART, AND MAYBE IT'S JUST ME

627
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,254
BEING HOT HEADED AND MAD BECAUSE

628
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,340
I DIDN'T GET TO GO HORSES BACK

629
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,218
RIDING BUT THAT WAS DUMB.

630
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,260
>> I'D LIKE JACLYN TO ENJOY HER

631
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,720
MEAL TODAY.

632
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,013
>> IT'S ABOUT MAKING HER HAPPY

633
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:18,931
RIGHT NOW.

634
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,682
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT,

635
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,851
AND WE'LL START THERE WITH

636
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,101
JACLYN?

637
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,686
>> NATURALLY, THE GOAL IS STILL

638
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,271
TO MAKE JACLYN SEE THE LODGE

639
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,397
NICK WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

640
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,482
MISSY, BAYLOR, AND NATALIE WILL

641
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,275
GO TO THE TOP THREE, AND THEY

642
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,860
WILL TAKE OUT JON AND JACLYN IN

643
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,695
THE PROCESS.

644
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,073
HOPEFULLY, THIS ILLUMINATES THAT

645
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,616
FOR HER AND I'M HOPING TO BE

646
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,159
ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT

647
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:39,493
MOVINGED FOR.

648
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,870
>> GIRL, YOU GOT A SHELL FULL OF

649
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,037
RICE.

650
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,371
>> ALL RICE?

651
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:42,579
>> YUP.

652
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,956
>> THAT?

653
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,165
THAT IS NOT MINE.

654
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:45,541
>> IT IS.

655
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,334
>> I CAN'T EAT THAT!

656
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,462
ALEC, REED, AND KEITH ARE ALL,

657
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,840
LIKE, BY ME NOW AND BEING SUPER

658
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:53,340
NICE AND IT'S SO FUNNY.

659
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,343
IT'S LIKE, REALLY, GUYS?

660
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,136
AND I WANT TO SAY, "STOP, STOP

661
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,971
BEING FAKE."

662
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,763
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M

663
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,764
INTERESTED TO SEE HOW TONIGHT

664
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,307
PLAYS OUT WITH THE GUYS, AND

665
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,770
WHAT THEY TRY AND PITCH TO ME.

666
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,312
>> BOTH MISSY AND JON ARE

667
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,941
THREATS TO ONE ANOTHER.

668
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,818
AND I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE

669
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,570
WHO'S GOING TO ACT FIRST.

670
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,738
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE MISSY IS

671
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,322
ALREADY ACTING.

672
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,407
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

673
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,616
>> SHE JUST ACTED TODAY.

674
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,742
IF YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID.

675
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,453
>> JON IS SO LOYAL, AND HE'S

676
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,872
IT'S ABOUT TRUST, AND STUFF LIKE

677
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,163
THAT.

678
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:25,789
WHICH IS TRUE.

679
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,000
BUT MISSY IS MORE RUTHLESS THAN

680
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:28,208
THAT.

681
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,793
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU

682
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,920
GUYS GET STEAMS ROLLED BY THAT,

683
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,963
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

684
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,507
>> SO IN THAT CASE I WOULD GO

685
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,216
WITH YOU AND THE GUYS.

686
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,136
S IT NOT THE FIRST TIME JON HAS

687
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,012
CAME BACK FROM EXILE AND I WAS

688
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,346
LIKE HOLD THE PHONE.

689
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,764
WE'RE FLIPPING THE GAME.

690
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,348
AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE AGAIN.

691
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,350
IT'S SO FUNNY.

692
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:45,934
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS

693
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,602
KEEPS HAPPENING.

694
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,479
>> MAN, THAT COULD BE HUGE.

695
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,253
>> WELCOME BACK.

696
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,047
>> WE GET BACK TO CAMP FROM THE

697
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,549
REWARD THIS MORNING, AND MY FEAR

698
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,676
FOR JACLYN IS THAT REED WAS

699
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,054
GOING TO BEND HER EAR.

700
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,597
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN EYE

701
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:23,764
OUT.

702
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:24,264
>> WE NEED A--

703
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,141
>> GOOD MORNING.

704
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:26,475
>> HEY, GIRL.

705
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,561
>> I HAVE TO KEEP NURTURING

706
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,396
JACLYN TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE

707
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,440
KNOWS THAT SHE'S STILL GOT ME

708
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,359
BECAUSE I THINK REED WORKS FAST,

709
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:43,075
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ALEC SAYS.

710
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,499
>> BAYLOR GETS ON MY NERVES,

711
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:50,666
MAN.

712
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,250
>> SO ARE YOU LIKE

713
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,126
BROTHER-SISTER, OR WHAT?

714
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,920
OR WOULD YOU TAKE HER ON A DATE?

715
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,505
>> THERE'S, LIKE, NO GIRL I'M

716
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,132
TAKING ON A DATE FROM

717
00:20:59,216 --> 00:20:59,424
"SURVIVOR."

718
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,550
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

719
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,885
UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO GO ON A

720
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,219
DATE WITH ME.

721
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,679
>> SHUT UP.

722
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,097
>> JACLYN IS A COOL CHICK.

723
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,099
I LIKE JACLYN A LOT.

724
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,643
SO IT WAS A SMART MOVE IN MAKING

725
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,894
HER FEEL AS COMFORTABLE AS SHE

726
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,229
CAN, AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S

727
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:12,854
GOING TO VOTE WITH US, BUT IT'S

728
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,731
NOT GOING TO HURT ANYBODY.

729
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,608
IT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE CREAM

730
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,318
CHEESE-- YOU KNOW, CREAM CHEESE

731
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,278
YOU CAN'T HURT MANY THINGS WITH

732
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,155
PUTTING CREAM CHEESE ON IT.

733
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,156
YOU KNOW I WANTED TO PLAY WITH

734
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,700
YOU AND IT SEEMED LIKE YOU

735
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,742
DIDN'T AT ALL GIVE ME THE TIME

736
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,035
OF DAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

737
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,745
>> LOOKING AT ALEC AND JACLYN,

738
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,413
I'M THINKING WHY IS JACLYN

739
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,497
FLIRTING WITH HIM?

740
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,250
JON'S BEEN GONE TWO DAYS, AND

741
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,376
ALEC AND HER BODY LANGUAGE IS

742
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,169
JUST REALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

743
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,838
IF IF I HAD A BOYFRIEND HERE, I

744
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,798
WOULDN'T BE ACTING LIKE THAT

745
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:48,015
WITH ALEC.

746
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:48,473
>> I NEED TO GET FAT.

747
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,558
>> I WANT TO HAVE A COMPETITION

748
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,936
WITH YOU AND JON AND DREW.

749
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,312
>> LET'S DO IT.

750
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,649
>> IT WOULD BE FUN TO GO OUT.

751
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,782
>> IT MADE ME DEFINITELY FEEL

752
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,867
SUSPICIOUS THAT JACLYN IS

753
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,493
WORKING WITH ALEC MORE CLOSELY

754
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,995
THAN I THOUGHT.

755
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,294
>> MY CONCERN IS DEFINITELY THAT

756
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,086
JACLYN WILL BE SUEDE BY ALAND HE

757
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,214
CAN THE OTHER GUYS, AND IF SHE'S

758
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,883
SWAYED, THEN JON IS SWAYED,

759
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,550
BECAUSE JACLYN AND JON DO

760
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:23,967
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

761
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,803
SO JACLYN AND ALEC FLIRTING AND

762
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,430
TALKING ABOUT THE GAME IS JUST

763
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,392
NOT OKAY.

764
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:58,585
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

765
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,796

771
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,600

772
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,227

00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,265
HAPPENED BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE

936
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:45,849
AGAIN AND WE HAVE ANOTHER BIG

937
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:51,312
DECISION TO MAKE.

938
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,356
I HAVE SO MUCH TO TELL YOU.

939
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,691
LIKE, MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE

940
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,275
CHANGED AGAIN WHEN YOU WERE

941
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:55,483
GONE.

942
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,860
WHEN YOU WALKED OUT OF THE

943
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,278
REWARD, MISSY PICKED NATALIE TO

944
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,070
GO WITH THEM.

945
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,738
AND, LIKE, EVERYBODY BEHIND ME

946
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,116
WAS LIKE, "THAT IS A HUGE-- THAT

947
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:03,950
IS SO TELLING RIGHT THERE WHO'S

948
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,869
GOING TO BE IN THE TOP THREE.

949
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:06,202
OF.

950
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,288
>> WHEN I GOT BACK AFTER MY

951
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,706
TWO-DAY EXILE, ALL I WANTED TO

952
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,082
DO WAS SPEND TIME WITH HER.

953
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,208
I'VE MISSED HER SO MUCH.

954
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,877
LIKE THE ONLY OTHER THING I DID

955
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,171
WHILE I WAS ON EXILE, I GOT

956
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,046
PARANOID AND I MISSED JACLYN.

957
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,090
>> THE THREE GUYS WANT US TO GO

958
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:19,591
WITH THEM.

959
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,508
>> THEY'RE ALL LYING.

960
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,427
>> CAN I JUST FINISH BEFORE YOU

961
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:22,844
FREAK OUT.

962
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,470
>> YEAH.

963
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,929
>> AND THE FIRST THING HAVE

964
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,764
JACLYN THROW ALL THIS PARANOIA

965
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,183
BACK ON ME, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE,

966
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,226
I THOUGHT THIS WAS DONE.

967
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,687
>> REED WANTS US TO BLINDS SIDE

968
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:32,896
MISSY.

969
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,897
>> I ALREADY KNEW ALL THIS.

970
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,397
I ALREADY KNEW ALL THIS.

971
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,857
>> OKAY, I'M SORRY.

972
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,609
I WON'T TELL YOU ANYMORE.

973
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,152
>> I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

974
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:39,360
>> HEY!

975
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:39,903
>> NO!

976
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,155
>> HEY, JACLYN, STOP!

977
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:42,864
>> WELL, WHAT THE HELL!

978
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,824
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU WHAT

979
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,074
HAPPENED?

980
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:45,533
>> I KNOW.

981
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,035
GIVE ME A SECOND, I'M SORRY.

982
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,496
HAVE YOU HAD A TWO-DAY EXILE.

983
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:49,829
>> NO.

984
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,830
>> IT SUCKS.

985
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,499
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT

986
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,500
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO ATTACK YOU

987
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,335
IN, LIKE, 10 MINUTES.

988
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,669
>> I'M GLAD YOU DID.

989
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,880
>> NEXT TIME I WON'T.

990
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,589
DON'T TOUCH ME.

991
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,340
>> I'M SORRY.

992
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:00,715
>> OKAY.

993
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:01,216
>> OKAY.

994
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:01,966
>> I'M SORRY.

995
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,842
SO JACLYN'S MAD AT ME NOW.

996
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,969
>> THERE'S NO POINT OF US

997
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,054
TALKING RIGHT NOW.

998
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,014
>> I GUESS IN VOICING MY

999
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,098
FRUSTRATION, I THINK JACLYN TOOK

1000
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,892
IS AS ME, LIKE, NOT BEING

1001
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,144
APPRECIATIVE OF HER GIVING ME

1002
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:13,853
INFORMATION, WHICH THAT'S NOT

1003
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,479
THE CASE.

1004
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,023
I MEAN, I JUST WANT TO BE WITH

1005
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:17,357
MY GIRLFRIEND.

1006
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,275
LET'S TALK FOR A LITTLE BIT.

1007
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,818
>> THERE'S NO POINT IN US

1008
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,444
TALKING RIGHT NOW.

1009
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,111
>> HEY.

1010
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:22,820
>> WHAT?

1011
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,154
>> CHILL.

1012
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:23,780
>> NO.

1013
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,949
>> LET'S TALK FAIR LITTLE BIT.

1014
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,910
>> I DON'T THINK HE REALIZED

1015
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,078
WHAT HE WAS DOING WHEN HE

1016
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,288
SNAPPED, BUT IF HE THINKS-- YOU

1017
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,083
KNOW, THAT HE'S GOT IT-- HE

1018
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,084
DIDN'T NEED MY HELP.

1019
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,794
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENED

1020
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,672
IN THE TWO DAYS THAT HE WAS

1021
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,589
GONE.

1022
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,215
HE'LL FIGURE IT OUT FOR HIMSELF.

1023
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,759
SO, YOU KNOW, IF HE'S GOT THAT

1024
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:45,885
ATTITUDE, SCREW HIM.

1025
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:46,219
>> HI.

1026
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:50,348
>> I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE-- I

1027
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,975
THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL JUST

1028
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,060
COME OVER AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE

1029
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,104
EXACTLY YOU'RE AT WITH

1030
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,105
EXPLAINING STUFF TO JON.

1031
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,606
YOU HAVE THREE GUYS THAT ARE

1032
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:58,940
REALLY WILLING--

1033
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,400
>> NOBODY'S WILLING TO GO TO THE

1034
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,651
TOP THREE WITH ME.

1035
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,944
DON'T GIVE ME THAT B.S.

1036
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,654
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BLINDS

1037
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,238
SIDE ME.

1038
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,864
>> NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT

1039
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,199
BLINDS SIDING YOU JON.

1040
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,033
IT'S ABOUT GETTING ANOTHER STEP

1041
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,618
IN THE GAME.

1042
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,120
>> IT'S GETTING MISSY OUT TO SET

1043
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,747
UP A BLINDS SIDE ON ME.

1044
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,541
>> I COULD JUST AS EASILY GO TO

1045
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,293
MISSY AND SAWHY NOT WORK WITH ME

1046
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,043
AND BLINDS SIDE JON

1047
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,086
>> I KNOW.

1048
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,213
>> I'M SAYING I LIKE YOU GUYS

1049
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,299
BETTER AND I'D RATHER WORK WITH

1050
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,049
THE TWO OF YOU.

1051
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:25,883
>> I GET IT.

1052
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,344
>> I JUST GOT YELLED AT, TWO.

1053
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,555
>> I WOULD RATHER WORK WITH YOU

1054
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,639
TWO BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

1055
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,766
IF I HAVE TO GO WORK WITH MISSY

1056
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,602
I'LL GO WORK WITH MISSY AT THIS

1057
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,478
POINT BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

1058
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,897
>> I BELIEVE YOUR WORD MORE THAN

1059
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,692
ANYONE ELSE'S, EVEN DESPITE WHAT

1060
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,818
HAPPENED AT THE LAST TRIBAL.

1061
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,403
LET'S SAY WE VOTE MISSING OUT

1062
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,112
THIS TIME.

1063
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:46,654
YOU'RE SAYING TO GO WITH US

1064
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,323
THREE AND ALAND HE CAN KEITH.

1065
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,490
>> HEY, NAT.

1066
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,950
>> I CAN'T-- I CAN'T--

1067
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:51,701
>> THEN--

1068
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,828
>> I CAN'T TRUST-- AFTER YOU

1069
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,664
VOTED MY NAME ONE TIME, LIKE A

1070
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,583
TRIBAL AGO, I CAN'T TRUST A

1071
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,000
PITCH FROM YOU BYES.

1072
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,002
>> I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT.

1073
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,837
>> IS IT OKAY IF I'M HERE, GUYS.

1074
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,171
>> YEAH.

1075
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,965
>> YEAH, YOU JUST HEARD IT.

1076
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,383
>> I WAS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE

1077
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,926
OF DOING THIS PITCH WHEN NATALIE

1078
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,178
WALKS UP AND SITS DOWN.

1079
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,972
AND JON WINKING AT ME AND GOING,

1080
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,891
"THAT'S YI CAN'T TRUST AND YOU

1081
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,184
THAT'S WHY I JUST CAN'T WORK

1082
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,895
WITH YOU, REED, IT DOESN'T MAKE

1083
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:19,729
ANY SENSE."

1084
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,813
THAT WAS ENCOURAGING BECAUSE IF

1085
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,439
HE'S WILLING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB

1086
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,067
AND DO A KIND OF WINK THING

1087
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,985
BETWEEN US, THEN MAYBE HE'S

1088
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:26,527
CONSIDERING IT A LITTLE MORE

1089
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,111
THAN HE WANTS TO LET ON.

1090
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,404
>> ALL RIGHT.

1091
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,114
>> I HONESTLY DON'T CARE IF YOU

1092
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:30,990
GUYS WANT TO TALK.

1093
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,367
>> NO, WE'RE GOOD.

1094
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,326
>> IT'S COOL.

1095
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,035
>> I THINK JACLYN GOT A LITTLE

1096
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,787
CONFUSED BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

1097
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,371
SHE NECESSARILY SAW THE WINK

1098
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,790
HAPPEN AND SHE WAS STILL STIEWG

1099
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,166
ABOUT I THINK BEING BLOWN UP AT

1100
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,877
BY JON, WHICH I'M KIND OF LIKE,

1101
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,798
AH, THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

1102
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,592
>> I TALKED TO JON AND JACLYN.

1103
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,134
AND THEY ACTUALLY MIGHT BE

1104
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,929
WILLING TO WORK WITH US.

1105
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,055
IF WE STAY STRONG, WE MAY HAVE A

1106
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,767
SHOT AT I THIS.

1107
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,977
>> I'M PRETTY SURE JON IS

1108
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,270
STANDING THERE SCRAMBLING WITH

1109
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:01,479
MISSY.

1110
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,189
>> I DID FIND THE IDOL.

1111
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,149
( LAUGHING )

1112
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,819
>> OH, MY GOD.

1113
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:08,111
YOU DID?

1114
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:08,986
>> YUP.

1115
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,612
I FOUND IT.

1116
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,281
>> OH, MY GOD!

1117
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,826
>> I LITERALLY HAVE THE WORST

1118
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,576
HEADACHE RIGHT NOW.

1119
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,120
TELL ME WHOSE NAME TO WRITE

1120
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:17,328
DOWN.

1121
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,079
I DON'T CARE.

1122
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,080
AFTER OUR ARGUMENT, THE ONLY

1123
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,039
PERSON I WOULD EXPECT JON TO

1124
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,041
TALK TO WOULD BE MISSY BECAUSE

1125
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,669
HE LOOKS TO HIS MOM FOR ADVICE

1126
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,546
IN REAL LIFE, AND I THINK THAT

1127
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,714
MISSY HAS TAKEN ON THAT ROLE ON

1128
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,297
THE ISLAND.

1129
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,215
AND IT MADE ME MAD MAHE TALKED

1130
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,551
TO HER FOR, LIKE, A HALF HOUR,

1131
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,136
AND DIDN'T COME TALK TO ME AT

1132
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:33,678
ALL.

1133
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,262
THAT MADE ME EVEN MORE MAD.

1134
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,473
LIKE, YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING WITH

1135
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:37,682
MISSY.

1136
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,182
YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH ME.

1137
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,183
>> HE JUST FREAKED OUT WHEN I

1138
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,686
TRIED TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED

1139
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,270
THE LAST TWO DAYS.

1140
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,980
>> FREAKED OUT LIKE WHAT.

1141
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,690
>> FREAKED OUT ON ME.

1142
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,315
SCREW HIM.

1143
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,233
HE DOESN'T NEED ME.

1144
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,151
I DON'T NEED TO BE HERE.

1145
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,152
>> NO, HE DOES NEED YOU.

1146
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,488
MY FEARS ARE THAT JON AND JACLYN

1147
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,156
ARE NOT AS ATTACHED AT THE HIP

1148
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,575
AS THEY SEEMED TO BE WHICH THEY

1149
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,159
DO HAVE A LOT OF FRICTION WHEN

1150
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,202
IT COMES TO HOW TO PLAY THIS

1151
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,579
GAME.

1152
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,288
>> OH, GOD.

1153
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,205
I'M EVEN MORE ANNOYED RIGHT NOW.

1154
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,374
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WANT

1155
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,167
JON AND JACLYN FINE FOR TONIGHT.

1156
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,587
I CAN'T DO ANY MORE SURPRISES AT

1157
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:07,795
TRIBAL.

1158
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,797
>> HI.

1159
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,715
>> I'M SORRY.

1160
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,466
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU

1161
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,383
RIGHT NOW.

1162
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:12,633
>> BABE.

1163
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,885
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU

1164
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:17,305
RIGHT NOW.

1165
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,100
>> I'M SORRY I SNAPPED.

1166
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:27,523
OKAY.

1167
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,400
MY BIG PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A

1168
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,027
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT, AND MY

1169
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,861
GIRLFRIEND IS NOT ON THE SAME

1170
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,653
PAGE AS I AM.

1171
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,198
AND SHE REFUSES TO TALK TO ME.

1172
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:40,912
NOT A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT.

1173
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,207
>> I FEEL REALLY BAD NOW.

1174
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,166
I DIDN'T MEAN TO-- I DIDN'T FEEL

1175
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,210
LIKE I WAS, LIKE, EXPLODING ON

1176
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:47,376
HER.

1177
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,920
>> JUST NOW?

1178
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,799
>> NO, WHEN I FIRST GOT BACK.

1179
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,133
>> YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO PROCESS,

1180
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,136
BROTHER, A LOT TO PROCESS.

1181
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,638
>> JUST TAKE A BREATHER.

1182
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,766
SHE'LL BE FINE.

1183
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,911
>> WE'VE GOT TO MAKE ANOTHER

1184
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,206
WOOD RUN.

1185
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,666
>> HI.

1186
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,668
>> I'M NOT READY TO TALK YET.

1187
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,919
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TALK NOW?

1188
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,838
>> I'M NOT READY TO TALK YET.

1189
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,297
>> NO!

1190
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:38,678
STOP!

1191
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,139
>> I'M GETTING THE SILENT

1192
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:42,974
TREATMENT RIGHT NOW FROM JACLYN,

1193
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,852
AND IT'S THE MOST FRUSTRATING

1194
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,269
THING THAT SHE DOES.

1195
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,437
THERE'S NO POINT.

1196
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,438
TALK IT OUT.

1197
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,898
LET'S TALK.

1198
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:57,363
>> NINE DAYS LEFT.

1199
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,406
>> THAT CAN BE MY ONLY CHANCE TO

1200
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,741
TALK BEFORE TRIBAL, AND JACLYN

1201
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,161
IS OVER THERE FLIRTING WITH

1202
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:03,369
ALEC.

1203
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,495
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

1204
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,248
VOTE FOR REED OR VOTE FOR MISSY.

1205
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,334
>> YOU KNOW HOW DISRESPECTED YOU

1206
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,419
MADE ME FEEL TODAY.

1207
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,378
LIKE, WHY DID YOU YELL AT ME

1208
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,505
LIKE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR

1209
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:14,755
ANYTHING--

1210
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,673
>> I WAS OVERWHELMED.

1211
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,967
I JUST GOT BACK FROM A TWO-DAY

1212
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,175
EXILE.

1213
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:18,509
I MISSED YOU.

1214
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,469
LIKE, ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS SIT

1215
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,304
DOWN WITH YOU AND RELAX FOR A

1216
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,639
MINUTE.

1217
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,307
OKAY, YOU KNOW, WHAT?

1218
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,058
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT.

1219
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:26,642
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO

1220
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,936
ME, GO BACK BY THE FIRE.

1221
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,186
IT'S FINE.

1222
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,438
>> I'M LISTENING.

1223
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,356
>> YOU'RE ROLLING YOUR EYES.

1224
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,275
>> YOU'RE BEING A ( BLEEP ) NOW.

1225
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,109
>> I'M PISSED.

1226
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,819
>> GOOD!

1227
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,780
>> MY WHOLE PLAN HINGES ON JON

1228
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,866
AND JACLYN, AND SHE'S FURIOUS.

1229
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,201
SHE'S STOMPING AROUND CAMP AND

1230
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,785
NOT TALKING TO HIM.

1231
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,287
MY LIFE HINGES ON THOSE TWO

1232
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,539
TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND

1233
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,373
FIGURING OUT WHO THEY WANT TO GO

1234
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,250
WITH THIS ALLIANCE OR THAT

1235
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:51,500
ALLIANCE.

1236
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,631
>>ALLIANCE.

1237
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,052
>> THEN THAT SUCKS FOR YOU.

1238
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,763
WELL, HE WON'T TALK TO ME NOW,

1239
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,221
SO.

1240
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,806
I TRIED.

1241
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,100
>> THIS MAY BE A FATAL FIGHT FOR

1242
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:24,408
MY GAME.

1243
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,455
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1244
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:33,918
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1245
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,337
JOSH, JEREMY, AND WES VOTED OUT

1246
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,384
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1247
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,637
SO, JON, AFTER THE CHALLENGE

1248
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,721
TODAY WHEN YOU WENT BACK TO

1249
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,181
CAMP, DID YOU GET AN UPDATE ON

1250
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:50,268
WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER YOU LEFT

1251
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,268
AND WAS SENT TO EXILE?

1252
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,645
>> YES, I DID.

1253
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,063
JACLYN TOOK ME OVER AND GAVE ME

1254
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,775
A QUICK UPDATE AND ACTUALLY IT

1255
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,735
KIND OF GOT HEATED BETWEEN

1256
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,654
JACLYN AND I.

1257
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,989
BECAUSE AFTER EXILE, THERE WERE

1258
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,031
THINGS THEY NEEDED TO BE CAUGHT

1259
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,366
UP ON, SO SHE TOOK THE

1260
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,618
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ME ASIDE AND

1261
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,120
TELL ME THOSE THINGS--

1262
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,788
>> AND HE FREAKED OUT ON ME.

1263
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,832
>> I GUESS I JUST WASN'T READY

1264
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,457
TO HEAR IT ALL.

1265
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,792
>> Jeff: SO A FIGHT ERUPTS.

1266
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,793
>> BASICALLY.

1267
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,460
>> Jeff: HOW BIG A FIGHT,

1268
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:16,711
JACLYN?

1269
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,005
>> WELL, HE SNAPPED AT ME PRETTY

1270
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,089
BAD AND I FELT LIKE HE DIDN'T

1271
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:20,715
WANT TO HEAR WHAT I WAS SAYING,

1272
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,842
HE HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

1273
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,594
SO I WAS LIKE, WOW, THAT'S SO

1274
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:25,928
DISRESPECTFUL.

1275
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,015
SO THEN I WAS MAD, STARTED

1276
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:29,223
CRYING.

1277
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:29,724
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

1278
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,100
>> YEAH.

1279
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,351
SO THAT KIND OF LED INTO THE

1280
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,436
AFTERNOON.

1281
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:33,644
AND --

1282
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,522
>> IS ANYBODY ELSE SEEING THIS

1283
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,231
GO ON?

1284
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,649
>> EVERYBODY IS SEEING IT GO ON.

1285
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,942
>> Jeff: SO THIS IS A PUBLIC

1286
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,234
ARGUMENT.

1287
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,027
>> YEAH, YEAH.

1288
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,569
>> Jeff: REED, WHAT DID YOU

1289
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:41,736
SEE?

1290
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,487
>> WELL, I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE

1291
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,156
KIND OF SAW WAS THE AFTERMATH OF

1292
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:45,573
WHAT HAPPENED.

1293
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,407
AND, YOU KNOW, FOR THOSE OF US

1294
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,451
WHO ARE STILL TRYING TO PLAY THE

1295
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,786
GAME AND TRYING TO STAY IN THE

1296
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,454
GAME, IT MADE EVERYTHING JUST

1297
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,748
MORE COMPLICATED.

1298
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,166
>> Jeff: JON, THIS IS A REALLY

1299
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,000
INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.

1300
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,544
WHEN YOU HAVE A LOVED ONE COUPLE

1301
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,422
HAVE A REAL-LIFE ARGUMENT IN THE

1302
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,300
MIDST OF THE GAME, AND YOU DON'T

1303
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:04,884
KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'VE REALLY

1304
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:05,092
TALKED.

1305
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:05,718
YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE ON

1306
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,303
THE SAME PAGE.

1307
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,137
DID YOU SENSE THAT PEOPLE WANTED

1308
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:08,596
TO TALK TO YOU GUYS?

1309
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,931
>> YEAH, AND ACTUALLY,

1310
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:11,390
ESPECIALLY REED.

1311
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,059
HE DID GET A MINUTE TO TALK TO

1312
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,061
BOTH OF US AND KIND OF PITCH A

1313
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:15,478
CASE.

1314
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:15,686
SO --

1315
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,437
>> HOLD ON.

1316
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,563
SO ONCE AGAIN, YOU AND JACLYN

1317
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,398
ARE IN THE MIDDLE.

1318
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,567
>> I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY

1319
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:21,776
THAT.

1320
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,570
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY

1321
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:24,779
THAT!

1322
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:29,617
>> Jeff: IT'S CRAZY, BUT IT'S

1323
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:29,909
TRUE, RIGHT?

1324
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,577
>> YES, WE ARE THE COUPLE THEY

1325
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,080
ARE APPROACH GLG YOUR PLEA TO

1326
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:34,663
THEM IS?

1327
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,623
>> I SAID AT THE REWARD

1328
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,875
CHALLENGE MISSY CHOOSES BAYLOR

1329
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,501
AND NATALIE AND CLEARLY WHEN YOU

1330
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,670
GET DOWN TO FIVE THE TWO OF YOU

1331
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,172
ARE GONE SO WHY DON'T YOU COME

1332
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,633
OVER TO ME, ALEC AND KEITH AND

1333
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,175
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

1334
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,468
>> Jeff: THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR

1335
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:47,760
YOU, MISSY.

1336
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,263
>> NO, IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME AT

1337
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:51,430
ALL.

1338
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,681
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT

1339
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,516
THEY THINK I'M ON TOP OF SOME

1340
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,600
POSITION SAYING YOU GUYS ARE ON

1341
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,851
THE BOTTOM.

1342
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,686
HOLD UP, LET'S GO BACK TO THIS,

1343
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,230
TWO DAYS PRIOR AND THEY TRIED TO

1344
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,481
CUT YOUR BOYFRIEND AT THE KNEES,

1345
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,857
AND THE ONE SITTING BEHIND YOU

1346
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,734
OVER HERE, ALEC, IS NOW FLIRTING

1347
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,152
HIS WAY BACK INTO JACLYN.

1348
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,737
IT'S THE BIGGEST JOKE!

1349
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,446
>> WOW.

1350
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,989
>> IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

1351
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,366
>> Jeff: LITERALLY FLIRTING?

1352
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,368
>> LITERALLY FLIRTING, OVER THE

1353
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:12,535
TOP.

1354
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,702
>> JACLYN, WOULD YOU AGREE WITH

1355
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,662
THAT, REALLY JAI MEAN, I DON'T

1356
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:14,829
KNOW.

1357
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,664
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FOOD, WE

1358
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,915
WERE LAUGHING THE OTHER DAY.

1359
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,500
MAYBE IT COULD BE PERCEIVED AS

1360
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,167
THAT, YES.

1361
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,085
>> Jeff: IF I'M LOOKING,

1362
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,545
THAT'S A YES.

1363
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,505
>> JON, DO YOU THINK ALEC FLIRTS

1364
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:24,880
WITH HER?

1365
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,799
>> THERE ARE TIMES I FEEL LIKE

1366
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,342
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE-- A LITTLE

1367
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:30,719
WEIRD BUT, LIKE, IT COULD JUST

1368
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,721
BE FRIENDLY JIBBER-JABBER.

1369
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,556
>> MAYBE I'M TOO NICE AND TOO

1370
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:33,848
FRIENDLY.

1371
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,559
>> ALEC HAS BEEN MORE NICE TO ME

1372
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,060
THAN HE HAS EVER BEEN.

1373
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,811
I WILL SAY THAT.

1374
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,728
>> Jeff: WHAT WAS YOUR

1375
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,647
RESPONSE, JACLYN, TO REED'S

1376
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:41,856
PITCH?

1377
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,191
>> I HONESTLY FELT LIKE PARTS OF

1378
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,527
MY HEAD WERE KIND OF BELIEVING

1379
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:46,694
THEM.

1380
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,237
I MEAN, I WOULD BE LYING IF I

1381
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,697
SAID I WASN'T HURT BY THE FACT

1382
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,324
THAT MISSY CHOSE NATALIE TO GO.

1383
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,242
BUT THEN AT THE SAME TIME, I

1384
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,952
COME BACK TO CAMP, AND ALL THE

1385
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,871
GRIEZ LIKE, WELL, THAT'S THE

1386
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,538
FINAL THREE AND IT'S VERY

1387
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,082
TELLING, SO THERE'S A LOT OF

1388
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,125
PARANOIA CREATED IN MY HEAD.

1389
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,169
AND IT'S NOT BEEN THE EASIEST.

1390
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:03,752
AND, JEFF, IT'S NOT GREAT FOR

1391
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,463
THE REST OF US BECAUSE, YOU

1392
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,047
KNOW, THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY

1393
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:07,214
WANT.

1394
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,591
THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT LUCK THEY

1395
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,717
THEY GET TO CHOOSE WHICH

1396
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,301
ALLIANCE THEY WANT TO BE WITH.

1397
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,636
>> Jeff: SO, MISSY, WHAT'S THE

1398
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,556
LEVEL OF CONCERN THAT THAT ONE

1399
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,557
DECISION COULD PUT YOU OUT OF

1400
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,016
THIS GAME?

1401
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,434
>> THERE'S A LEVEL OF CONCERN

1402
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,394
BECAUSE I KNEW GOING BACK THAT

1403
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:21,896
SHE WAS GOING TO BE APPROACHED.

1404
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,647
I MEAN, I KNEW IT, SO, YEAH,

1405
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,692
THAT DECISION OF CHOOSING

1406
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,568
NATALIE COULD COST ME.

1407
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,152
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1408
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,654
TO VOTE.

1409
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:43,834
KEITH, YOU'RE UP.

1410
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,419
>> YOU HAVE TO GO BECAUSE YOU'RE

1411
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,046
A BIG RABBLE-ROUSER.

1412
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,964
AND BY THE WAY, MY CHILD'S NOT A

1413
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:59,767
BRAT.

1414
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,436
>> THIS THE WILL LIKELY BE THE

1415
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,230
ONLY TIME I EVER WRITE YOUR NAME

1416
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:09,777
DOWN.

1417
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,247
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1418
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:27,169
VOTES.

1419
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:31,257
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1420
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,007
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1421
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:37,721
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1422
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:37,930
OKAY.

1423
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:38,472
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1424
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,306
DECISION IS FINAL.

1425
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:39,848
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1426
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:40,391
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1427
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:40,933
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1428
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,812
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1429
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:49,441
FIRST VOTE, REED.

1430
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,652
MISSY.

1431
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,612
REED.

1432
00:42:53,696 --> 00:43:00,119
THAT'S TWO VOTES REED.

1433
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:00,327
REED.

1434
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,371
THAT'S THREE VOTES REED, ONE

1435
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,749
VOTE MISSY.

1436
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,459
REED.

1437
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:13,882
FOUR VOTES REED.

1438
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,217
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

1439
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,011
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, REED.

1440
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:17,636
THAT'S FIVE.

1441
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,220
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1442
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:24,518
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1443
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,693
REED, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1444
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,405
>> OUCH, JEFF.

1445
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,656
>> Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1446
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:43,245
>> THANKS.

1447
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,586
>> Jeff: AND THAT'S WHY "BLOOD

1448
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,211
VERSUS WATER" IS SO DIFFICULT.

1449
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,213
WHEN YOU PLAY WITH A LOVED ONE,

1450
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,840
YOU BRING YOUR PERSONAL LIFE

1451
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,884
INTO AN ALREADY-COMPLICATED

1452
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,927
GAME, AND WITH FOUR LOVED ONES

1453
00:43:59,011 --> 00:43:59,678
LEFT, THIS WON'T BE THE LAST

1454
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,722
TIME YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

1455
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:02,097
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1456
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,557
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1457
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,767
GOOD NIGHT.

1458
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,810
>> THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THE

1459
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,064
MOST AMAZING/TERRIFYING

1460
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:10,814
EXPERIENCE I THINK I'VE EVER HAD

1461
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,441
IN MY LIFE.

1462
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,610
THIS HAS BROUGHT JOSH AND I EVEN

1463
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,320
CLOSER WITH BOTH BEING SUCH

1464
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,363
SUPER NERDS ABOUT THIS SHOW BUT

1465
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,405
BEING ABLE TO SHARE THIS

1466
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,076
TOGETHER HAS BEEN SO INCREDIBLE.

1467
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,703
SO PROBST, SNUFFED MY TORCH

1468
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,206
TONIGHT, WHICH IN AN ODD WAY IS

1469
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,835
A DREAM COME TRUE, TOO.

1470
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,801
>> I KNOW.

1471
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,178
>> THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE

1472
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,304
ALL BEEN ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT

1473
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,681
A VOTE, THOUGH, GOOD LORD.

1474
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,099
>> I'M REALLY SORRY.

1475
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,350
>> ME, TOO.

1476
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,018
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TOWRND MINE

1477
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:48,185
YOU.

1478
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:48,769
>> IT'S FINE.

1479
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,439
>> I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

1480
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:52,940
OPINION, AND I LOVE YOU.

1481
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,067
>> OKAY.

1482
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,112
JON AND I, WE KIND OF RESOLVED

1483
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:58,946
EVERYTHING AT TRIBAL, WHICH WAS

1484
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,656
PRETTY INTERESTING.

1485
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,031
WE'RE FINE.

1486
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,618
HE SAID SORRY, AND I SAID SORRY.

1487
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:05,869
SO I'M HAPPY IT'S OVER BECAUSE

1488
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,790
TODAY WAS SERIOUSLY EMOTIONALLY

1489
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,040
DRAINING.

1490
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:10,916
IT'S BEEN A LONG DIE.

1491
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,502
>> YEAH, I KNOW, RIGHT?

1492
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,712
>> TRIBAL GOT KIND OF HEATED

1493
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:15,963
TONIGHT.

1494
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,714
EVERYONE THINKS I'M A BIG FLIRT,

1495
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,799
BUT THAT IS A SICK JOKE.

1496
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,718
IF I WANTED TO FLIRT WITH ANY OF

1497
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,429
THESE GIRLS HERE, I WOULD, BUT I

1498
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,014
WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

1499
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,641
STILL, SEEING ALL THESE OTHER

1500
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,768
LOVED ONES TOGETHER IS TOUGH.

1501
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,062
IT REALLY IS TOUGH.

1502
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,064
AND IT REALLY DIDN'T HIT ME

1503
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:34,815
UNTIL TONIGHT, BUT I'VE GOT

1504
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,941
LITERALLY NO ONE TO COME AND

1505
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,818
TALK TO AFTER TRIBAL.

1506
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,362
AND IT JUST SUCKS.

1507
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,239
SO I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO HOLD ON

1508
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:51,748
TO, BUT I'M STILL HOLDING ON.

1509
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:58,964
>> BREAKFAST!

1510
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,092
>> YEAH!

1511
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,305
SEEING YOU GUYS CAN GO AND

1512
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,140
RELATE WITH MISSY AND BAYLOR AND

1513
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,976
IT'S JUST LIKE-- I'M JUST LIKE

1514
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,730
HERE BY MYSELF.

1515
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,981
>> I HONESTLY DO NOT BELIEVE

1516
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,859
THAT KEITH OR ALEC HAVE ANY PLAY

1517
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,237
LEFT IN THE GAME.

1518
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,615
>> I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING TO BE

1519
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,200
STRAIGHTED FOR, RIGHT.

1520
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,201
AND I'M GOING TO BE.

1521
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,453
I HONESTLY DO NOT SEE FINDING A

1522
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,413
CRACK AND SPLITTING US UP, AND

1523
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,039
LOOKING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE,

1524
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,583
IT PROBABLY SOUND LIKE I'M

1525
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,211
TALKING "SURVIVOR" SUICIDE, BUT

1526
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,921
I-- I TRUST THEM.

1527
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:39,588
I REALLY DO.

1528
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,256
>> IT DOES ACTUALLY SEEM LIKE I

1529
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,967
FOUND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRUSTWORTHY

1530
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,427
AND UNLESS I AM READING

1531
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:45,969
EVERYTHING WRONG, WHICH I

1532
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,597
HAVEN'T YET, I'M STILL

1533
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,181
CONTROLLING AND STEERING THE

1534
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,309
DIRECTION OF THE GAME.

1535
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:21,088
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1536
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,839
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

1537
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,632
REWARD CHALLENGE?

1538
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,258
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

1539
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,177
GOING TO STAND ON A SMALL BLOCK,

1540
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,512
WHILE STABILIZING A BALL AGAINST

1541
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,764
AN OVER-HANGING PIECE OF WOOD.

1542
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,015
IF AT REQUEST POINT, YOU LOSE

1543
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:32,891
JUR CONCENTRATION ON YOUR

1544
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,936
BALANCE, THE BALL WILL DROP, AND

1545
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,104
EUROPE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

1546
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,357
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

1547
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:40,607
REWARD.

1548
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,359
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING

1549
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:42,526
FOR?

1550
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:42,985
>> YES.

1551
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,069
>> Jeff: THE WINNER WILL HAVE

1552
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,823
DELIVERED TO CAMP A KING-SIZED

1553
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:48,240
CANOPY BED.

1554
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,616
>> OH, MY GOD!

1555
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,909
>> Jeff: YOU WILL ENJOY A NICE

1556
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,371
MEAL IN THAT BED-- SPAGHETTI.

1557
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:54,997
CHICKEN PARMESAN.

1558
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,498
GARLIC BREAD.

1559
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,207
>> OH!

1560
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,042
>> Jeff: WINE, AND DESSERT.

1561
00:47:59,126 --> 00:47:59,376
>> IT'S OVER.

1562
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,002
>> Jeff: IT'S YOUR BEST SHOT

1563
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,046
TO GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP ON A

1564
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,132

1565
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,049

1566
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:06,300
CHALLENGE.

1567
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,552
AND AS ALWAYS, THE WINNER WILL

1568
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,929
DECIDE WHO GOES TO EXILE ISLAND.

1569
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,556
BIG STAKES.

1570
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,015
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

1571
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,391
WE'LL GET STARTED.

1572
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,267
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1573
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:21,732
>> I'M WINNING THIS.

1574
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,733
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY

1575
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,361
TAKE YOUR POSITIONS.

1576
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,946
PLACE YOUR BALL, STABILIZE IT

1577
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,075
AGAINST THE WOOD.

1578
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,869
MAKE SURE YOU'RE STABLE.

1579
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,330
GOTTA KEEP ONE FOOT ONLY ON THAT

1580
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,789
BLOCK.

1581
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,082
EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD.

1582
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:43,795
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

1583
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,212
ANOTHER TEST.

1584
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,798
THIS ONE REQUIRES CONCENTRATION

1585
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,092
AND BALANCE.

1586
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,011
AND JUST LIKE THAT, ALEC DROPS

1587
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:51,261
QUICKLY.

1588
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,263
HE'S OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

1589
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,140
NO SHOT AT REWARD.

1590
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,183
30 DAYS OF FRUSTRATION SETTING

1591
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,061
IN.

1592
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:03,565
WE'RE DOWN TO SIX NOW.

1593
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,567
YOU CANNOT LET YOUR

1594
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,027
CONCENTRATION LAPSE.

1595
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,030
ALL IT TAKES IS JUST A LITTLE

1596
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:10,280
MOVEMENT.

1597
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,407
THE BALL THE SLIDE OUT, AND

1598
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:20,332
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

1599
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,417
JACLYN WITH A NICE RECOVERY.

1600
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,545
THIS WILL BE A BIG WIN, FOOD AND

1601
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,005
SLEEP, TWO THINGS YOU TAKE FOR

1602
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,507
GRANTED BACK HOME.

1603
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,008
NOT OUT HERE.

1604
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:41,311
OUT HERE, YOU HAVE TO EARN IT.

1605
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,112
EVERYBODY FEELING IT NOW.

1606
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,114
THIS IS NOT EASY.

1607
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,075
JON'S BALL WEDGING A LITTLE TO

1608
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,034
THE SIDE.

1609
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,078
FATIGUE STARTING TO SET IN ON

1610
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,121
THE ARMS.

1611
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,248
YOU'RE FEELING IT IN ALL PART OF

1612
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,249
YOUR BODY-- YOUR FEET, YOUR

1613
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,794
BACK.

1614
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,923
KEITH WITH SOME MOVEMENT.

1615
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,717
MISSY'S BALL'S STARTING TO SLIDE

1616
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,177
UP A BIT.

1617
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,262
JON'S BALL MOVING SOME MORE.

1618
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,682
KEEP CONCENTRATING.

1619
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,225
KEEP PRESSURE AGAINST THAT BALL,

1620
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:24,938
NOT TOO MUCH, THOUGH.

1621
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,231
MISSY DROPS OUT.

1622
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,859
MISSY, SECOND PERSON OUT OF THIS

1623
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:29,109
CHALLENGE.

1624
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,444
GOING TO TAKE A SPOT ON THE

1625
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,448
BENCH, JOINING ALEC.

1626
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,949
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT FROM

1627
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:42,539
BAYLOR.

1628
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,958
KEITH DROPS OUT.

1629
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,376
NO SHOT AT REWARD FOR KEITH.

1630
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,338
AND WE ARE DOWN TO FOUR.

1631
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,882
JOB FIGHTING.

1632
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:52,466
THAT BALL HAS BEEN MOVING THE

1633
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,342
ENTIRE CHALLENGE, BUT HE'S STILL

1634
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,344
UP THERE.

1635
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,722
NOT ONLY ARE YOU PLAYING FOR

1636
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:58,972
REWARD.

1637
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,058
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD YOUR CASE

1638
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,393
IF YOU GET TO FINAL TRIBAL TO

1639
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,686
SHOW THAT YOU WON SOMETHING.

1640
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,228
>> GOD.

1641
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,146
YEAH, I DON'T GOT THAT GOING FOR

1642
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:12,235
ME.

1643
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,237
>> Jeff: BAYLOR DROPS OUT.

1644
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,322
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.

1645
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,742
JON'S BALL IS JUST HANGING ON

1646
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,202
THE SIDE OF THE BOARD BUT IT'S

1647
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,203
STILL THERE.

1648
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,288
>> JON'S IN TROUBLE HERE IT

1649
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,458
LOOKS LIKE.

1650
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,001
>> Jeff: JON'S BALL MOVING A

1651
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:28,502
LITTLE MORE.

1652
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:37,344
HE'S TRYING TO GET IT BACK.

1653
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,429
>> JON, JON, JON, JON, JON.

1654
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,224
>> Jeff: JON SUCCESSFULLY GOT

1655
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,226
HIS BALL BACK CENTERED, A GREAT

1656
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,102
RECOVERY.

1657
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:55,153
PUTS HIM RIGHT BACK IN THIS.

1658
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,863
A LITTLE MOVEMENT FROM JACLYN'S

1659
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:02,869
BALL DOWN ON THE END.

1660
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,246
JON STRUGGLING AGAIN TO KEEP

1661
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:08,583
THAT BALL BALANCED.

1662
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,586
SLOWLY TRYING TO RECOVER YET

1663
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:18,844
AGAIN.

1664
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:23,598
JON CAN'T HANG ON ANY LONGER.

1665
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,684
BIG EFFORT, CAME UP SHORT, AND

1666
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,018
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

1667
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,271
IT IS NATALIE AND JACLYN, FOR

1668
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,649
REWARD.

1669
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,069
KEEP DIGGING.

"SURVIVOR" PUSHES YOU TO GO PAST

1671
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,531
THAT PLACE OF COMFORT.

THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO RIGHT

1673
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,242

1674
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,452
JACLYN WITH ANOTHER NICE

NATALIE STRUGGLING NOW.

1677
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:02,596
JACLYN DROPS OUT.

00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,430
NATALIE WINS REWARD.

<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

1680
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,437

>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, BIG REWARD

1689
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:22,657
FOR NATALIE.

1690
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,783
FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DECIDE,

1691
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,451
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO SEND TO

1692
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,203
EXILE ISLAND.

1693
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,372
>> IT WILL BE ALEC.

1694
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,625
>> Jeff: NO HESITATION.

1695
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,126
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S WHATEVER.

1696
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:33,627
I FIGURED IT WAS COMING.

1697
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,629
IT'S NOT REALLY A SURPRISE.

1698
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,379
>> Jeff: ALEC, HERE'S A MAP TO

1699
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,547
EXILE.

INVITE ONE PERSON TO JOIN YOU.

1711
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,151
>> I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH

1712
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:58,360
JACLYN.

00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,402
SHE TALKS ABOUT SPAGHETTI MORE

1714
00:53:59,486 --> 00:53:59,819

00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,504
AND JACLYN ALONE, BUT NO GETTING

1727
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,923
FREAKY TONIGHT, GUYS.

1728
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:20,715
>> Jeff: MISSY.

1729
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,800
>> YOU'RE ALREADY GETTING READY

1730
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,093
TO LEAVE.

1731
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,261
HOW DOES THIS FEEL, MISSY.

1732
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,137
YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION ON

1733
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,306
THE OTHER SIDE WHEN YOU CHOSE

1734
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,016
AND SOMEBODY WAS DISAPPOINTED.

1735
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,393
>> YEAH, AND IT'S GOING TO BE AT

1736
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,435
CAMP, SO THAT'S NOT FUN.

1737
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,061
>> UH-OH.

1738
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:33,687
>> IT'S GOING TO BE RUBBED RIGHT

1739
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,189
IN OUR FACES, SO THAT'S THE

1740
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:36,481
DIFFERENCE.

1741
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,983
>> YUP.

1742
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,527
>> I'M USED TO IT.

1743
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,403
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, NATALIE,

1744
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,531
JACLYN, JON, NICE REWARD.

1745
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:44,990
BED WILL BE DELIVERED.

1746
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,951
HAVE A GOOD MEAL.

1747
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:48,493
KEITH, MISSY, BAYLOR, GOT

00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,453
NOTHING FOR YOU.

1749
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:50,829
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1750
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:51,997
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1751
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,373
>> I'VE BEEN WANTED TO GET JON

1752
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:58,545
OUT SO PICKING JACKIE AND JON

1753
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,130
FOR REWARD SHOWS I'M SUCH A

1754
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,423
LOYAL PERSON AND THEY WILL TRUST

1755
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,174
ME MORE SO WHEN I TAKE MY

1756
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,135
REVENGE, HE WILL NEVER SEE IT

1757
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:05,468
COMING.

1758
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,193
>> OH, MY GOD, IT'S BIG.

1759
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:22,610
>> IT'S SO PRETTY.

1760
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,445
>> WE GOT BACK FROM THE REWARD,

1761
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,572
AND THE BED WAS SET UP.

1762
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,573
PART OF YOU IS SO HAPPY, LIKE

1763
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,700
OH, MY GOSH, SOMETHING

1764
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,745
COMFORTABLE TO LAY ON.

1765
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,871
WHAT?

1766
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:36,291
>> THIS WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THE

1767
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:36,624
GUEST BEDROOM.

1768
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:36,958
>> YEAH.

1769
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:37,584
>> BUT THEN YOU LOOK OVER AT THE

1770
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,377
OTHER PEOPLE, AND YOU REALIZE,

1771
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,755
OH, WE'RE GOING TO BE ENJOYING

1772
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,590
THAT WHILE THEY'RE STARING AT

1773
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,632
US.

1774
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:48,386
>> THEY'RE TALKING.

1775
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,680
>> GO GRAB SOME WATER.

1776
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,932
>>IARY GOING TO GO GET WATER?

1777
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,976
>> I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING WEIRD

1778
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,729
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1779
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:58,563
>> MISSY, BAYLOR, AND KEITH KIND

1780
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,774
OF JUST LEFT AND WALKED OFF, AND

1781
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,526
I WAS LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON?

1782
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,945
BUT JON HAS HAD A REALLY STRONG

1783
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:06,446
BOND WITH MISSY FROM THE

1784
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,447
BEGINNING, SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN

1785
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,783
KEEP GOING WITH THAT AND NOTHING

1786
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:10,158
CRAZY WILL HAPPEN.

1787
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,701
>> I JUST FEEL SO BAD.

1788
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,577
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE MISSY'S

1789
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:12,786
PISSED.

1790
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,662
>> IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

1791
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,955
THEY'LL GET OVER IT, BUT RIGHT

1792
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,457
NOW IT'S BITTER BECAUSE THEY

1793
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:17,624
SEE--

1794
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,585
>> GUYS, YOU ARE BEING SO

1795
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:20,835
PARANOID.

1796
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,128
YOU GUYS ARE THE WORST.

1797
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,129
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO JUST HANG OUT

1798
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:23,713
WITH ME AND EVERYBODY WILL BE

1799
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:23,922
FINE.

1800
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:24,589
>> YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1801
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,674
AS WE'RE APPROACHING THE END OF

1802
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,510
THIS GAME, THERE ARE ALWAYS

1803
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,178
CHANCES FOR WEIRD THINGS TO

1804
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:30,428
HAPPEN.

1805
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,972
BUT I'VE GROWN TO TRUST MISSY A

1806
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:33,139
LOT.

1807
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,058
AND THE MORE I GET TO KNOW

1808
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,434
NATALIE, THE MORE REASSURED I AM

1809
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:44,025
OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR ALLIANCE.

1810
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,693
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, CHEERS TO

1811
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,653
DAY 30, AND THEN WE CAN START.

1812
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,114
>> CHEERS.

1813
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,824
>> REWARD AT THIS POINT IN THE

1814
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,075
GAME IS WAY MORE THAN JUST

1815
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,077
GETTING TO SLEEP IN A BED AND

1816
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,621
ENJOYING PASTA AND CHICKEN PARM.

1817
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:57,580
>> OH, MY GOD.

1818
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,582
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN

1819
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,126
DREAMING ABOUT FOR 30 DAYS.

1820
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,502
>> EVERYBODY IS SO COMFORTABLE

1821
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:02,794
NOW.

1822
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:06,214
THEY PROBABLY WANT TO GET RID OF

1823
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,298
KEITH BECAUSE KEITH'S CONNECTION

1824
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,633
WITH THE JURY IS SCARY.

1825
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:11,302
BUT I WANT TO BLINDED SIDE JON.

1826
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,848
I'M GETTING BACK AT JON FOR

1827
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,265
JEREMY.

1828
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,891
I DON'T TRUST JON IN THE LONG

1829
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:17,058
RUN.

1830
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,518
I WANT TO MOVEED FOR WITH A NEW

1831
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,646
PLAN WITHOUT JON IN IT YOU CAN

1832
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,981
HAVE MY WINE.

1833
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,232
>> THANKS!

1834
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:28,361
>> CALL ME A WINE SNOB, BUT I

1835
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:29,612
LIKE WINE BECAUSE IT'S A MEMORY

1836
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,614
OF MY DAD TEACH MEEG HOW TO

1837
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,991
DRINK WINE PROPERLY.

1838
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,242
THERE WERE SO MANY LAYERS OF

1839
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,410
COMPLEXITY TO WINE.

1840
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,494
THAT THE FURTHER YOU GET INTO

1841
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,371
IT, THE MORE YOU REALIZE OH, MY

1842
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:38,538
GOSH.

1843
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,497
I HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED THE

1844
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,999
SURFACE OF IT.

1845
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:44,043
AND IT'S SUCH A CONVERSATION

1846
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:44,252
PIECE.

1847
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:47,547
I WANT TO GET MY REP PORUP FOR

1848
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,591
BEING A SOMELLIER.

1849
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,967
I WILL PROBABLY END UP WORKING

1850
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,594
IN ONE OF THE NICE

1851
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,386
ESTRESTAURANTS IN LAS VEGAS.

1852
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:54,637
IT WILL BE, LIKE, A YEAR IN LAS

1853
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,639
VEGAS AND THEN WE FINISH LIVING

1854
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,224
A YEAR IN ITALY.

1855
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,143
>> OH, MY GOD, AMAZING.

1856
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,103
JON IS ALWAYS BRINGING UP ANY

1857
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,062
EXCUSE TO TALK ABOUT WINE AND

1858
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,815
HOW HE WANTS TO-- I DON'T KNOW,

1859
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,067
BE SOME KIND OF WINE SPECIALIST

1860
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,612
IN THE FUTURE AND MOVE TO VEGAS.

1861
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,696
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT, BUT HE IS

1862
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,115
ALWAYS TRYING TO PRETEND HE

1863
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,200
KNOWS EVERYTHING AND THE

1864
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,743
ARROGANCE OR ENTITLEMENT JON

1865
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,243
HAS.

1866
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,119
HONESTLY, EVERY TIME HE TALKS

1867
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:18,703
ABOUT WINE I JUST WANT TO BE

1868
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:20,246
LIKE SHUT UP.

1869
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,540
IT WAS TORTURE, BASICALLY.

1870
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,459
ARE WE GOING TO TALK STRATEGY AT

1871
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:24,626
ALL.

1872
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,169
>> WHAT STRATEGY DO WE NEED TO

1873
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:26,377
TALK?

1874
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:26,753
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1875
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,546
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE I CAN TRUST

1876
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,548
100% THAT THE PLAN IS WHAT WE

1877
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,758
SAY IT IS BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE

1878
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:37,805
WE CAN TRUST YOU VERY WELL.

1879
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:38,181
HOW ABOUT THIS.

1880
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,974
BECAUSE OF HOW COMFORTABLE WE

1881
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,684
ARE WITH YOU, I DID FIND THE

1882
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,394
IDOL.

1883
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,187
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

1884
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,521
>> THAT'S SO CRAZY.

1885
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,482
>> YOU'VE HAD SO MUCH LUCK ON

1886
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:47,690
EXILE.

1887
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,235
JON SHOULD NOT TRUST ME BUT I'M

1888
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,152
HAPPY THAT HE DOES.

1889
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,154
THE FACT THAT HE TOLD ME THAT HE

1890
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,490
FOUND AN IDOL ON EXILE IS

1891
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,741
AMAZING BECAUSE I'VE BECOME LIKE

1892
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,951
THE BEST FRIEND NOW FOR HIM.

1893
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,328
GETTING JON OUT NOW IS REALLY

1894
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:00,620
IMPORTANT.

1895
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,246
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

1896
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,580
DO ALL THIS, AND IF I COULD FULL

1897
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,416
OFF, THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

1898
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,436
>> YOU WERE MOVING A LOT.

1899
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,397
>> I KNOW, SORRY.

1900
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,066
I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE.

1901
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,735
IT FREAKED ME OUT.

1902
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,950
I WAS JUST LISTENING TO HIM TALK

1903
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,034
AND TALK AND TALK.

1904
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,661
HE FEELS SO COMFORTABLE AFTER

1905
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,620
LAST NIGHT.

1906
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,746
HE'S ALREADY BANKING ON WHAT

1907
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,581
HE'S GOING TO DO WITH THE

1908
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:46,249
MILLION DOLLARS.

1909
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:46,833
HE'S LIKE I CAN'T WAIT TO DO

1910
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,543
THIS AND THIS AND THIS.

1911
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,585
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY.

1912
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,253
>> EVERYTHING.

1913
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:50,837
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GAME FOR

1914
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,004
THEM.

1915
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,589
IT'S JUST ABOUT THEM AND THEIR

1916
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,173
PERFECT LIFE THEY WANT AS A

1917
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:54,382
COUPLE.

1918
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,633
JON IS VERY CONFIDENT.

1919
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,177
HE THINKS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

1920
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,846
A REALLY EASY CAKEWALK TO THE

1921
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,764
FINAL THREE BECAUSE HE HAS MISSY

1922
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:02,181
AROUND HIS FINGER.

1923
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,559
HE THINKS BAYLOR IS NOT GOING TO

1924
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,685
DO ANYTHING TO MESS UP HIS MOM'S

1925
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:05,893
PLAN.

1926
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,854
HE HAS HIS GIRLFRIEND WRAPPED

1927
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,897
AROUND HIS FINGER AND HE THINKS

1928
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,026
I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER HE

1929
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,192
WANTS.

1930
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,485
>> HE'S SUCH A PUNK.

1931
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:14,986
>> I JUST WANT HIM OUT.

1932
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,529
>> YEAH.

1933
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:18,364
EVEN THOUGH HE'S OBNOXIOUS,

1934
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:18,990
JON'S PLAYED A REALLY GOOD GAME.

1935
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,742
THE MORE AND MORE I'M THINKING

1936
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,701
OF THE JURY, WHY RISK EVEN GOING

1937
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,703
TO FINAL THREE WITH SOMEBODY

1938
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,287
LIKE JON.

1939
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,872
IF HE WINS, I WILL LITERALLY

1940
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:26,164
KILL MYSELF.

1941
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,749
I SAY WE VOTE OUT JON.

1942
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,585
BUT DON'T TELL MISSY BECAUSE

1943
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,669
THESE NOT GOING TO VOTE JON OFF.

1944
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,213
YOUR MOM IS KIND OF BLINDED BY

1945
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:34,380
JON.

1946
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,051
>> NOT ONLY THAT, MY NOM IS

1947
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,304
BLINDED BY TRYING TO HELP HIM.

1948
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,849
>> ME AND NATALIE ARE KIND OF

1949
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,768
"SURVIVOR"" SISTER AT THIS POINT

1950
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,562
AND DECIDED TO GET RID OF JON.

1951
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:50,605
UNFORTUNATELY, MY MOM, MY

1952
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:51,564
CLOSEST ALLIANCE HERE, IS

1953
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:51,939
ALIGNED WITH HIM.

1954
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,274
>> HOW WAS IT?

1955
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:53,524
SO GOOD?

1956
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:54,400
>> IT WAS GOOD.

1957
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,152
IT'S WEIRD, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE

1958
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:56,819
WE'RE, LIKE SITTING OVER THERE

1959
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,697
AND THE WHOLE TIME WE'RE LIKE,

1960
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,699
THIS SUCTION, WE CAN'T JUST

1961
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,493
SHARE THIS WITH EVERYBODY.

1962
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:04,744
>> JON JUST REMIND ME TOO MUCH

1963
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:08,706
OF PAST MEN IN MY MOM'S LIFE

1964
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,501
WHERE SHE GETS BLINDS SIDED,

1965
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,251
HEARTBROKEN AND HURT AND I DON'T

1966
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,295
WANT HIM TO SCREW HER OVER.

1967
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,339
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL BAD

1968
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,465
VOTING HIM OUT.

1969
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,717
>> ME, YOU, KEITH, AND ALEC.

1970
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:20,885
I KNOW THEY WILL VOTE HIM

1971
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:22,345
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE JON.

1972
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,765
JUST HOPEFULLY HE DOESN'T WIN

1973
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:29,769
IMMUNITY.

1974
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,785
>> THEY SLEEP ALL NIGHT AND THEY

1975
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:50,790
SLEEP ALL DAY.

1976
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,709
I'M BEHIND THE 8 BALL RIGHT NOW,

1977
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,794
AND IT PISSES ME OFF THAT JON'S

1978
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,379
JUST COASTING.

1979
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,631
I DON'T HAVE NO STROKE OUT HERE.

1980
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:00,800
I'M NOT THE CAPTAIN OUT THERE.

1981
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:04,762
THAT FIVE-SOME THEY'VE GOT IS

1982
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:04,971
TIGHT.

1983
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,305
I'M ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN.

1984
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,599
I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY IS GOING TO

1985
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,059
BOLT BEFORE LONG AND HOPEFULLY

1986
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:15,064
THEY'LL BOLT MY WAY.

1987
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,249
>> TODAY, I GOT A VERY WEIRD

1988
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:34,208
VIBE FROM CAMP.

1989
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:34,834
AND IT WORRIED ME BECAUSE WE'RE

1990
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,837
SO CLOSE TO THE END.

1991
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,632
A WEIRD VIBE CAN MEAN VERY BAD

1992
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,258
THINGS.

1993
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,801
>> I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S GOING

1994
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,345
ON BACK THERE.

1995
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,347
DO YOU REALLY TRUST NATALIE?

1996
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,932
>> YEAH.

1997
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,685
>> MAYBE I'M JUST BEING

1998
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:54,020
PARANOID.

1999
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:54,353
I DON'T KNOW.

2000
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,106
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY OUT HERE,

2001
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:57,482
HONESTLY.

2002
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,275
BUT IF-- BUT YOU HAVE A

2003
01:02:59,358 --> 01:02:59,734
CONNECTION WITH THEM.

2004
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:03,779
I DON'T.

2005
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:04,822
>> I'M WORRIED THAT KEITH IS

2006
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:05,990
TRYING TO SWAY MISSY, BAYLOR,

2007
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,825
AND NATALIE TO PROBABLY VOTE OUT

2008
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,368
JON.

2009
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,287
IT JUST MAKES ME SO NERVOUS THAT

2010
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,123
JON THINKS HE GOT IT IN THE BAG,

2011
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,416
AND THAT'S HOW WE ARE IN REAL

2012
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,334
LIFE, TOO.

2013
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,003
LIKE, HE GETS SUPER AMPED UP FOR

2014
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:19,837
STUFF AND REALLY POSITIVE AND,

2015
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,547
"I GOT IT."

2016
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,174
AND THEN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND

2017
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:23,841
HE'S SUPER DISAPPOINTED.

2018
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,259
AND I'M WORRIED IF HE'S NOT

2019
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,427
CAREFUL, THAT COULD HAPPEN TO

2020
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:31,140
HIM AGAIN.

2021
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:54,956
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

2022
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,666
WE'LL NOW BRING IN ALEC,

2023
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:57,625
RETURNING FROM EXILE ISLAND.

2024
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,502
>> YAY!

2025
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:02,296

01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,889
ONE IN SIX SHOT AT WINNING THIS

2209
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:27,097
GAME.

2210
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,516
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 32

2211
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,267
OBVIOUSLY VERY TOUGH DAYS,

2212
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:33,395
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT,

2213
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,939
WILL BECOME THE FIFTH MEMBER OF

2214
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,857
OUR JURY, AND WILL HAVE A BIG

2215
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,651
HAND IN DECIDING WHO WINS THIS

2216
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:38,817
GAME.

2217
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,318
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

2218
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:39,693
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

2219
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,278
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL,

2220
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:41,528
CONGRATS.

2221
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:44,031
>> I LITERALLY THOUGHT WE COULD

2222
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:47,076
GET OUT JON TONIGHT AND WE WON

2223
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:47,660
IMMUNITY SO WE HAVE TO COME UP

2224
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,453
WITH A PLAN "B" AND FAST.

2225
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:52,122
I'M FEELING OH, MY GOD, NOW WHAT

2226
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,123
DO I DO?

2227
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,513
>> HOME, SWEET HOME.

2228
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,932
>> GOOD JOB, JON!

2229
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,142
>> THANKS!

2230
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,144
WINNING THIS IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

2231
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,312
WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

2232
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,398
ESPECIALLY WHEN GOING INTO IT, I

2233
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,150
DID HAVE A FEW WORRIES ABOUT MY

2234
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:20,401
ALLIANCE.

2235
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,152
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I WAS JUST

2236
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,445
BEING A LITTLE PARANOID, BUT

2237
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,198
IT'S A GREAT FEELING GOING INTO

2238
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:27,700
TRIBAL HAVING THE NECKLACE.

2239
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:28,867
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

2240
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,785
ANYTHING GOING ON TONIGHT.

2241
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:30,411
JUST FOCUS ON WHAT WE NEED TO

2242
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:31,954
DO.

2243
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,540
JUST IN CASE ONE OF THEM SOMEHOW

2244
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,376
HAS AN IDOL, WE HAVE THE

2245
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:37,584
NUMBERS.

2246
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,545
WE SHOULD JUST SPLIT THE VOTE

2247
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:40,546
JUST TO BE SAFE.

2248
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,464
THREE ON KEITH, AND AS LONG AS

2249
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,299
HE DOESN'T PLAY AN IDOL, HE'S

2250
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,800
GOING HOME.

2251
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:45,968
>> EXACTLY.

2252
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:46,552
>> TRIBAL TONIGHT, THE PLAN IS

2253
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,679
TO GET KEITH OUT.

2254
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:51,557
HE'S AN INCREDIBLE THREAT AND

2255
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,433
NALL IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

2256
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:53,851
HE'S BEEN RIGHT IN THE FIGHT IN

2257
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:54,643
EVERY SINGLE ONE.

2258
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:55,519
HE'S WON TWO OF THEM.

2259
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:59,148
SO HE NEEDS TO GO.

2260
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,399
>> JON WANTS TO SPLIT THE VOTES,

2261
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,484
AND THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

2262
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,570
JON IS MY GUY.

2263
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,281
HE'S GOT MY BACK.

2264
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,408
SO OUR FAB FIVE IS STRONG, AND

2265
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:15,497
WE'RE SENDING KEITH HOME.

2266
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:18,959
>> ME, YOU, AND JON ON KEITH,

2267
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,170
AND MISSY AND BAYLOR ON ALEC.

2268
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,921
>> EITHER WAY, I GUESS IT'S GOOD

2269
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,549
TO SCARE ALEC, TOO, AND NOT MAKE

2270
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:26,008
HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE.

2271
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,176
>> LET'S SPLIT.

2272
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:27,634
WE MIGHT AS WELL.

2273
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:28,802
>> THAT'S GOOD.

2274
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:29,553
JON WINDS IMMUNITY, AND I WAS

2275
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,181
JUST SO MAD.

2276
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,474
I FELT LIKE EVERYTHING I WAS

2277
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:34,558
DOING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF

2278
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,185
DAYS WAS JUST DOWN THE CRANE,

2279
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,312
AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DEPRESSED

2280
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:39,813
AT THIS POINT.

2281
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,273
EVERYTHING DITO GET HIM OUT, AND

2282
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:42,232
I CAN'T KICK HIM OUT.

2283
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,193
I GAVE HIM THE REWARD BECAUSE I

2284
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:44,735
WANTED TO BLINDS SIDE HIM.

2285
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:47,529
>> TRUST ME, I WAS ON BOARD FOR

2286
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:47,738
TODAY.

2287
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,156
>> KEITH, STUPID ASS.

2288
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,324
>> I KNOW, HE FREAKED OUT.

2289
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:51,784
>> I NEED HIMED TO WIN THAT.

2290
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,827
>> IT COMPLETELY SUCKS THAT JON

2291
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:54,661
WON IMMUNITY TODAY.

2292
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,330
NATALIE AND I WERE BANKING ON

2293
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:57,706
HIM NOT WINNING AND NOW IT'S

2294
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,333
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND

2295
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:00,334
IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THERE'S

2296
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:09,676
NOT MUCH TIME LEFT.

2297
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,637
>> EVERYBODY I WAS CLOSE WITH IN

2298
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,766
THE GAME IS GONE.

2299
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:16,350
BESIDES YOU.

2300
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:16,934
BUT I'M JUST SAYING, YOU'RE

2301
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:19,561
GOING TO VOTE ME OUT, TOO.

2302
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,396
DEFINITELY SEEMS LIKE A TOSS-UP

2303
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:21,939
BETWEEN KEITH AND MYSELF.

2304
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:23,941
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

2305
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,651
I MEAN, MY BACK'S AGAINST THE

2306
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,320
WAW, AND I JUST GOTTA START

2307
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:29,655
SWINGING.

2308
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,366
SO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO,

2309
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:32,991
WHOEVER I HAVE TO LIE TO, FLIRT

2310
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:33,617
WITH, WHATEVER, I'M WILLING TO

2311
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,576
DO IT AT THIS POINT.

2312
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,955
I'M NOT, LIKE, AN EMOTIONAL

2313
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:38,288
DUDE.

2314
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:39,873
NORMALLY I'M, LIKE, SUPER TOUGH,

2315
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:40,499
AND I JUST SAY ( BLEEP ) AND DO

2316
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:45,838
MY OWN THING AND I'LL BE FINE.

2317
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:51,385
I JUST KIND OF LOST THAT.

2318
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:51,593
WHAT?

2319
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,678
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

2320
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:56,306
>> I'M JUST GETTING WISDOM FROM

2321
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,849
ALEC, AND I LIKE IT.

2322
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,226
>> I'M NOT GIVING YOU WISDOM.

2323
01:13:59,309 --> 01:13:59,977
IT'S NOT WISDOM.

2324
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:00,519
>> I'M GETTING TRUE FEELINGS

2325
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:01,603
FROM ALEC.

2326
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,438
THAT'S-- THAT'S NEW.

2327
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:03,981
>> YEAH.

2328
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,983
I NORMALLY DON'T SHARE MY

2329
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:09,278
FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS.

2330
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,863
BUT THIS GAME HAS REALLY DONE

2331
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,281
SOMETHING TO ME.

2332
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:14,783
>> ALEC AND I EYE DON'T KNOW.

2333
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:18,453
WE DO HAVE SUCH AN UP-AND-DOWN

2334
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,581
RELATIONSHIP, BROTHER-SISTER,

2335
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:21,206
BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND WEIRD KIND

2336
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:21,582
OF THING.

2337
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:22,666
STILL, PART OF ME IS GLAD HE'S

2338
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:25,002
NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT BECAUSE I

2339
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:26,712
SAW A DIFFERENT SIDE OF HIM THEY

2340
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:27,212
HAVEN'T SEEN IN THIS GAME.

2341
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,006
AND I LIKED IT.

2342
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,008
I LIKED IT A LOT.

2343
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:32,718
JUST BE PATIENT.

2344
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:36,722
TRUST ME.

2345
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:43,729
>> WELL YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IT'S

2346
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,731
LIKE-- IT'S EITHER YOU OR ALEC

2347
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:46,064
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

2348
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:46,732
>> OH, YEAH.

2349
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,401
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU DESERVE TO BE

2350
01:14:49,484 --> 01:14:53,238
HERE MORE THAN ALEC.

2351
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,698
BUT I THINK YOU'RE SCARY ON

2352
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:55,115
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

2353
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:55,616
THAT'S YET DECISION IS

2354
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:55,908
PROBABLY--

2355
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,284
>> OH, ME?

2356
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:00,078
>> YEAH, COME ON, ALEC IS

2357
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:00,287
USELESS.

2358
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:00,662
>> YEAR, HE IS.

2359
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,207
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

2360
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,166
HIM WINNING.

2361
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:04,750
>> I WAS REAL CLOSE AGAIN TO

2362
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,627
GETTING THE NECKLACE TODAY, AND

2363
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,128
I COULD KICK MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

2364
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,087
I NEEDED IT.

2365
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,172
I NEEDED IT.

2366
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,840
EVERYBODY KNOWS I NEED IT.

2367
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,593
IT IS A BAD FEELING.

2368
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,345
IT'S BURNING YESTERDAY, AND IT'S

2369
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,262
BURNING AGAIN TODAY THAT THEY'RE

2370
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,805
JUST LAYING UP OVER THERE.

2371
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,141
AND Y'ALL ARE TAKING THEM TO THE

2372
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:21,308
END?

2373
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:21,892
YOU ALL COULD SEND A MESSAGE

2374
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:23,977
JUST LIKE THAT.

2375
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:26,355
TAKE ALEC OUT OR TAKE ME OUT BUT

2376
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:27,314
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

2377
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:27,940
EVENTUALLY TAKE EACH OTHER OUT.

2378
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,108
>> I HAVE BEEN FEELING

2379
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,026
COMPLETELY HELPLESS TO DO

2380
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:32,736
ANYTHING AT THIS POINT, BUT I

2381
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:35,280
JUST REALIZED, OH, MY GOD, I

2382
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,574
COULD TOTALLY FLIP THE ENTIRE

2383
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:38,283
GAME.

2384
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,494
>> YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO THINK

2385
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:41,578
WHO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE THREE

2386
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,914
WITH BUT YOU BETTER START

2387
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:44,164
THINKING.

2388
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,749
>> KEITH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

2389
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:47,751
I'M SMARTER THAN I LOOK

2390
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:48,001
SOMETIMES.

2391
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,087
RIGHT NOW THE PLAN IS SPLIT

2392
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:50,295
VOTES.

2393
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,214
ME, JON, AND JACLYN ARE VOTING

2394
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:56,260
FOR KEITH, BUT FIFLIP, AND KEITH

2395
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:58,178
VOTES ALEC, ALEC WILL GO HOME

2396
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,973
AND KEITH WILL BE HERE, BE LOYAL

2397
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,517
TO ME, AND I CAN USE HIM TO

2398
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,476
BLINDS SIDE JON.

2399
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:05,727
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR

2400
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:05,978
TONIGHT?

2401
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:06,687
>> I GUESS I'LL VOTE FOR ALEC.

2402
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,481
>> FIDO THIS AND BETRAY JON, IT

2403
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:11,024
WILL BE MY BIGGEST MOVE YET.

2404
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:11,733
THE ONLY SCARY THING FOR ME,

2405
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,777
THEN, IS DEALING WITH EVERYTHING

2406
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,611
WHEN I COME BACK TO CAMP BECAUSE

2407
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:17,239
JON IS GOING TO BE REALLY

2408
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:18,448
PISSED.

2409
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,284
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'M THINK.

2410
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,369
I VOTE ALEC TONIGHT INSTEAD OF

2411
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:22,703
KEITH.

2412
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,246
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.

2413
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,206
KEITH IS GOOD ON IMMUNITY

2414
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,250
CHALLENGES AND WOULD BE AGAINST

2415
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:28,417
JON.

2416
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,918
>> NATALIE WANTS TO MAKE BIG

2417
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,670
MOVES AND I DO AS WELL, BUT I

2418
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,839
DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO GET RID

2419
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,133
OF ALEC RIGHT NOW.

2420
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:38,468
IT'S A HUGE RISK BECAUSE JON

2421
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,553
COULD FREAK OUT AND TURN ON US

2422
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,847
IN A HEARTBEAT.

2423
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,807
ALEC WILL DO WHATEVER WE SAY

2424
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:44,224
AFTER KEITH'S GONE.

2425
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,768
>> THE THING SI DON'T KNOW IF

2426
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:47,769
IT'S WORTH IT ME GETTING IN

2427
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,147
TROUBLE WITH MY ALLIANCE, SO I'M

2428
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,273
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A

2429
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:52,482
DECISION, I GUESS, TONIGHT.

2430
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:53,358
ULTIMATELY, IT'S JUST DECIDING

2431
01:16:53,442 --> 01:17:00,741
IF I HAVE THE BALLS OR NOT UPON

2432
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:15,589
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

2433
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:19,176
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

2434
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:19,384
JOSH.

2435
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:19,801
JEREMY.

2436
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:20,927
WES.

2437
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,137
AND REED VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

2438
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,891
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2439
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:26,808
SO, MISSY, BIG VOTE TONIGHT.

2440
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,685
BECAUSE IF WE GO ON THE

2441
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,937
ASSUMPTION THAT WE STILL HAVE

2442
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,898
THIS ALLIANCE OF FIVE, YOU AND

2443
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,316
BAYLOR, JON AND JACLYN, AND

2444
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:35,734
NATALIE, AND WE HAVE THESE TWO

2445
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,986
OUTSIDERS LEFT, KEITH AND ALEC.

2446
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,821
FAIR ASSUMPTION?

2447
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,073
FAIR ASSUMPTION.

2448
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,115
>> Jeff: SO REALLY IT COMES

2449
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:42,783
DOWN TO NOT ONLY WHO YOU VOTE

2450
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:44,993
OUT BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT WHO

2451
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,495
YOU KEEP AROUND.

2452
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:46,953
>> YEAH.

2453
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,498
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT WHO IS

2454
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,541
THE BEST AT CHALLENGES.

2455
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,585
WHO WOULD BE HARDER TO BEAT.

2456
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:54,544
>> Jeff: JON, DO YOU AGREE

2457
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:55,962
WITH THAT, THAT IT'S REALLY

2458
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,547
ABOUT WHO'S STRONG AT

2459
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:57,839
CHALLENGES?

2460
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,423
>> RIGHT NOW, YEAH, I THINK

2461
01:17:58,507 --> 01:17:59,007
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S COMING

2462
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,801
DOWN TO AT THIS POINT.

2463
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:04,054
>> Jeff: SO IF THAT STRATEGY

2464
01:18:04,137 --> 01:18:04,763
COMES OUT TO PLAY, KEITH, THEN

2465
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,224
YOU WOULD BE THE OBVIOUS TARGET

2466
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:07,933
BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF

2467
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:08,433
SUCCESS IN CHALLENGES.

2468
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,185
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, I'VE WON A

2469
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:10,769
COUPLE OF IMMUNITY DEALS.

2470
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,397
BUT I'M REALLY NOT GOOD IN SOME

2471
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,773
OTHER STUFF, TOO.

2472
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:17,192
SO IT'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

2473
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:19,152
>> Jeff: NATALIE, AM I MISSING

2474
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:19,444
SOMETHING?

2475
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:19,986
OR IS THIS JUST THE WAY THIS

2476
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:22,280
GROUP IS GOING, THAT WE JUST

2477
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,950
DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BEAT US?

2478
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,035
>> UM, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

2479
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,871
BUT I WOULD SAY IF SOMEBODY'S

2480
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,832
INTIMING IN CHALLENGES, THEN,

2481
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:32,874
YEAH, THAT'S SCARY.

2482
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,627
BUT I THINK THERE IS A LOT MORE

2483
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:36,878
THAT GOES UNDER IT.

2484
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,798
>> Jeff: SO WHOEVER SURVIVES

2485
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,217
TONIGHT, FINDS THEMSELVES IN AN

2486
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:42,801
INTERESTING SITUATION BECAUSE

2487
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,845
HAVING A LOVED ONE IS NOT

2488
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:45,178
NECESSARILY--

2489
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,513
>> AAHH!

2490
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:48,181
>> OH, MY GOD!

2491
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:56,148
>> IT'S A RAT!

2492
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,190
SPHWHRU WOULD EAT THAT RAT?

2493
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,193
>> I MEAN, THAT'S HOW HUNGRY I

2494
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,820
AM, YEAH.

2495
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:02,404
HONESTLY, AFTER EXILE ISLAND I

2496
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:03,947
WOULD EAT THAT RAT WITHOUT A

2497
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:04,239
HESITATION.

2498
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:05,782
>> Jeff: JON, SEEING A RAT

2499
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,201
SCURRY ACROSS TRIBAL COUNCIL

2500
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:08,827
BRINGS IT ALL HOME TO WHAT'S

2501
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,455
HAPPENING OUT HERE.

2502
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:12,080
AND THAT IS YOU GUYS ARE LIVING

2503
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:15,500
IN THE JUNGLE WITH NOTHING.

2504
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,544
TRY TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE

2505
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:18,795
FOR ME.

2506
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,797
>> I ACTUALLY THINK BACK JUST TO

2507
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,257
THIS MOST RECENT REWARD.

2508
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,050
IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE SMALLEST

2509
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:26,219
THING, BUT IT BROUGHT OUT A

2510
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,597
TRAY, AND THERE WAS AN ACTUAL

2511
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,306
WINE GLASS ON IT.

2512
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:30,974
I'M A HUGE WINE FAN.

2513
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,392
THAT'S BECAUSE MY DAD INTRODUCED

2514
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:33,977
ME TO WINE, AND HE'S DYING OF

2515
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,562
BRAIN CANCER RIGHT NOW, AND, YOU

2516
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:37,856
KNOW, BEING OUT HERE JUST

2517
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:40,609
REMINDS YOU WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

2518
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:41,985
AND WHEN I WON THIS IMMUNITY

2519
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:43,945
TODAY, I TEARED UP, BECAUSE I

2520
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:44,863
KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

2521
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,115
MOMENTS THAT MY DAD IS GOING TO

2522
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,909
BE ABLE TO SAY TO ME, "SON, I'M

2523
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:50,160
PROUD OF YOU FOR THAT."

2524
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:50,994
AND I DON'T HAVE VERY MANY OF

2525
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:53,914
THOSE MOMENTS LEFT WITH HIM.

2526
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,373
>> Jeff: WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR

2527
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,834
DAD SAY THE WORDS "SON, I'M

2528
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:00,670
PROUD OF YOU," WHAT IS THE

2529
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:01,796
FEELING INSIDE?

2530
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,089
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST THING

2531
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:07,928
THAT COMES TO MIND IS REGRET.

2532
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,555
BECAUSE MY DAD AND I REALLY ONLY

2533
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,641
STARTED TO BOND A LOT THE PAST

2534
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,185
TWO OR THREE YEARS.

2535
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:17,938
AND I CAN ADD SO MUCH MORE TIME

2536
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:18,855
AND COULD HAVE BUILT SO MUCH

2537
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:22,526
MORE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM,

2538
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,361
AND I LOOK BACK AT ALL THE YEARS

2539
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:27,155
THAT I WAS STUBBORN AND THAT I

2540
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:31,618
WOULDN'T LET HIM IN, THAT I-- I

2541
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:32,994
REGRET IT EVERY DAY.

2542
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:39,167
I REGRET SO MUCH OF IT.

2543
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,211
>> Jeff: KEITH, YOU'RE A DAD.

2544
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:41,920
YOUR SON IS SITTING RIGHT OVER

2545
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,630
THERE ON THE JURY.

2546
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:44,172
THIS GAME IS COMPLICATED.

2547
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:49,302
BECAUSE ON ONE HAND, THIS IS A

2548
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,220
VERY PERSONAL SHARING THAT JON

2549
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:51,429
IS DOING.

2550
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:54,099
AND YET, THERE'S THIS CRAZY

2551
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:54,266
GAME.

2552
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,017
AND IT'S ONLY A GAME.

2553
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,894
BUT YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINK,

2554
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:01,982
MAN, COULD HIS TRAGEDY WORK

2555
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:02,941
AGAINST ME IN THIS GAME?

2556
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,110
AND IS THAT FAIR?

2557
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,697
>> I-- I GUESS IT'S ALL FAIR ON

2558
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,322
"SURVIVOR," BUT I HOPE THEM FOUR

2559
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,741
OVER THERE ARE SHARPER THAN

2560
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:11,950
THAT.

2561
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,368
I'M GOING TO BE OVER THERE

2562
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:13,660
EVENTUALLY.

2563
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:14,786
A LOT OF US ARE.

2564
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:16,079
AND I HOPE WE'RE SHARPER THAN

2565
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:18,623
THAT TO SEE THROUGH SOME OF THIS

2566
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:18,790
STUFF.

2567
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:19,541
>> Jeff: SO, KEITH, IF YOU'RE

2568
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,293
THE TARGET, AND YOU KNOW THAT,

2569
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,252
WHAT DO YOU CO?

2570
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:24,504
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LAY DOWN AND

2571
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:24,671
DIE.

2572
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:25,130
>> THAT'S RIGHT, JEFF.

2573
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,047
I'VE GOT A VOTE HERE.

2574
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,884
IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING, USE

2575
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:30,635
MY VOTE.

2576
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:31,845
SEE WHO THEY THINK.

2577
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:33,430
SEE IF THEY'LL TAKE ME UP ON IT.

2578
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:35,890
>> Jeff: NATALIE, THIS IS WHY

2579
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,058
TONIGHT'S VOTE IS SO CRITICAL.

2580
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,310
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR

2581
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,061
SOMEBODY IN THIS FIVE TO MAKE A

2582
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:40,937
GIANT MOVE AND SAY TO THE JURY,

2583
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:44,774
"I CAME TO PLAY, AND I CAME TO

2584
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:44,983
WIN."

2585
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,818
>> YEAH, I FEEL LIKE NO MATTER

2586
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,028
WHAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I

2587
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:49,029
KNOW EVERYBODY IS THINKING ABOUT

2588
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:50,363
ONE THING, WHICH IS THEY WANT TO

2589
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,407
WIN A MILLION BUCKS.

2590
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:53,158
SO NO MATTER WHAT ALLIANCE WE'RE

2591
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,535
IN, EVERYBODY IS LOOKING OUT FOR

2592
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:55,827
THEMSELVES.

2593
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,245
AND I KNOW IT'S COMING AND IT'S

2594
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,455
SCARY, BUT TONIGHT I'M CONFIDENT

2595
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,080
THAT, YOU KNOW, ALL OF US ARE ON

2596
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,916
THE SAME PAGE, NO SURPRISES WHEN

2597
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,710
IT COMES TO THE ALLIANCE OF

2598
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:07,255
FIVE.

2599
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,423
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

2600
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:09,049
TO VOTE.

2601
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:21,978
BAYLOR, YOU'RE UP.

2602
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,773
>> SORRY, BROTHER.

2603
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:25,231
IT'S EITHER YOU OR ME.

2604
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:29,110
HAD TO DO IT.

2605
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,675
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

2606
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:56,179
VOTES.

2607
01:22:56,262 --> 01:23:01,601
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

2608
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:02,227
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

2609
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:09,651
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

2610
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:09,859
OKAY.

2611
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:10,402
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

2612
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:10,819
DECISION IS FINAL.

2613
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:11,403
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

2614
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:11,903
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

2615
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:12,737
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

2616
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,115
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

2617
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:17,409
FIRST VOTE.

2618
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:21,246
KEITH.

2619
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:25,375
ALEC.

2620
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:27,419
KEITH.

2621
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:28,753
ALEC.

2622
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:29,713
WE'RE TIED.

2623
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:33,216
TWO VOTES KEITH, TWO VOTES ALEC.

2624
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:39,889
THAT'S THREE VOTES KEITH.

2625
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:40,974
WE'RE TIED.

2626
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,559
THREE VOTES ALEC, THREE VOTES

2627
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:46,062
KEITH, ONE VOTE LEFT.

2628
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:47,230
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

2629
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:50,233
THE FIFTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

2630
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:51,443
ALEC.

2631
01:23:51,526 --> 01:24:05,123
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

2632
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:18,219
ALEC, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

2633
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,182
>> Jeff: WELL, BASED ON THE

2634
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:23,266
REACTIONS AFTER THE VOTE, THIS

2635
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:25,977
TIGHT ALLIANCE OF FIVE MIGHT NOT

2636
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,520
BE SO TIGHT.

2637
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:28,897
KEITH, THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR

2638
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:29,063
YOU.

2639
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,106
>> SURE IS.

2640
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:32,108
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

2641
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:33,693
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

2642
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,863
GOOD NIGHT.

2643
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,869
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

2644
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:46,206
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

2645
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:50,585
>> Jeff:NEXT TIME ON

2646
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:50,960
"SURVIVOR":

2647
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,172
>> Jeff: NATALIE WON'T REST

2648
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:58,051
UNTIL SHE GETS REREVENGE ON JON.

2649
01:24:58,134 --> 01:24:59,302
>> I WANT JON OUT BAD.

2650
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:00,762
>> Jeff: BUT ONE MOMENT COULD

2651
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:05,058
CHANGE THE FATE OF THE GAME.

2652
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:07,727
>> YOU NEED AN X-RAY.

2653
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:14,192
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING!

2654
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:18,112
>> I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY MY

2655
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:18,696
AMBITION I CLEARLY WASN'T GOOD

2656
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,323
AT ANY OF THE CHALLENGES.

2657
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:21,825
AND THE ODDS WERE AGAINST ME FOR

2658
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:22,909
A LONG TIME IN THE GAME.

2659
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:25,286
AND I JUST KEPT FIGHTING AND I'M

2660
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,955
NOT COMPLETELY CONTENT BECAUSE I

2661
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:27,664
WANTED TO GO FURTHER.

2662
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:29,457
BUT I GAVE IT MY ALL.

2663
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,459
I DIDN'T WIN, BUT AT LEAST I

2664
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:32,544
BEAT DREW.

2665
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,504
SO THAT COUNTS AS A WIN FOR ME.
