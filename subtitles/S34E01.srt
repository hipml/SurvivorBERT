>> Jeff: OVER 17 YEARS AND 33

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:17,726
SEASONS, THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR"
HAS EVOLVED.

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:24,274
THESE ARE THE PLAYERS THAT
CHANGED THE GAME.

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,361
>> COMING INTO THIS GAME, I
ALREADY KNOW I'M A HUGE THREAT.

5
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,279
I CREATED THE SPY SHACK.

6
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,322
I FOUND THE SPECIAL IDOL.

7
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,116
I VOLTED OUT MY CLOSEST ALLY.

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,409
>> THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

9
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,618
>> THANK YOU.

10
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,163
>> JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU SEEN
IT ALL, YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,249
YET.

12
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:46,296
>> IN "SURVIVOR" PHILIPPINES AND
SURVIVOR CARAMOAN, I SWUNG FOR

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,842
THE FENCES MAKING SPLASHY,
FIREWORK-TYPE MOVES.

14
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,637
THIS IS THE OTHER IMMUNITY IDOL,
I'M GIVING IT TO EDDIE.

15
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,388
>> Jeff: THE LOOKS ON FACES.

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,099
>> I HAVE A REPUTATION TO
UPHOLD.

17
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,851
I'M GOING TO KEEP MAKING BIG
MOVES.

18
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,643
I'M SO EXCITED.

19
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,981
I CAN'T STOP BOUNCING IN MY
SEAT.

20
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:08,860
>> I'M THE ONLY PERSON TO EVER
WIN "SURVIVOR" TWO TIMES.

21
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,155
IT ONE JUST LUCK.

22
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,032
I'M AGAINST YOU, RUSSELL.

23
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,494
THAT'S WHAT I KNOW HOW TO DO,
MAKE IT TO DAY 39 AND NOT GET

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,495
VOTED OFF.

25
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,498
THE QUEEN STAYS QUEEN.

26
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:27,712
ADIOS.

27
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:32,675
>> I AM A BONA FIDE EX-COUCH
POTATO THAT SAW THIS GAME AND

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,677
LOVED IT.

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,390
IF YOU WERE TO GIVE UP IMMUNITY,
I WOULD BELIEVE YOU.

30
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,520
I'M A GANGSTER WITH A SOMETIME,
LIKE A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING.

31
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,981
>> I WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TO NATALIE.

32
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:47,524
SORRY.

33
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,399
I MADE IT TO THE END.

34
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:58,034
THE ONLY NEXT STEP FOR ME IS TO
WIN.

35
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:03,665
>> ANYBODY WHO WATCHED
"SURVIVOR" KAOH RONG WOULD NOVI

36
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,418
STRENGTH LIKE A GYMNAST AND A
TENACITY LIKE A GIANT SQUID.

37
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,711
I WANT HIM GONE.

38
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,712
>> OKAY.

39
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,714
>> WHEN I COME INTO THIS GAME,
IT'S GO FOR BROKE.

40
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,384
THIS IS THE KENTUCKY DERBY, THE
PREAKNESS AND THE BELMONT STAKES

41
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:21,391
ALL AT ONCE, SO YOU BETTER GO
FOR IT.

42
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:27,230
>> Jeff: THEY'LL BATTLE IT OUT
ON THE ISLANDS OF FIJI AS

43
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,439
"SURVIVOR" KICKS OFF ITS
500th EPISODE.

44
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:34,404
>> WE'VE ALL CHANGED THE GAME,
SO TO WIN THIS GAME, YOU HAVE TO

45
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,699
GO BIG OR GO HOME.

46
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,408
>> Jeff: THIS IS "SURVIVOR:
GAME CHANGERS," 39 DAYS, 20

47
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,492
PEOPLE, ONE SURVIVOR.

48
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,457
(<i> THEME SONG PLAYING</i> )
>> Jeff: WELCOME TO THE

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,127
34th SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,674
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YOU WERE EACH HAND-PICKED

51
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,846
BECAUSE YOU SHARE ONE THING IN
COMMON: YOU HAVE PROVEN YOU ARE

52
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,682
WILLING THE MAKE THE KIND OF
MOVES THAT WILL CHANGE THE GAME.

53
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,644
SOME OF YOU MAKE BOLD MOVES.

54
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,812
SOME OF YOU MAKE QUIET MOVES.

55
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:55,485
SOME OF YOU HAVE MADE MOVES THAT
WERE SO SUCCESSFUL THEY'RE

56
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,653
LEGENDARY.

57
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,113
AND OTHERS HAVE MADE MOVES THAT
WERE A DISASTER AND GOT YOU

58
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,281
VOTED OUT.

59
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,576
BUT THAT'S THE NATURE OF A GAME
IN WHICH THERE IS ONLY ONE

60
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,327
WINNER.

61
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,453
MOST MOVES WON'T WORK.

62
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:10,291
IT'S HAVING THE GUTS TO MAKE THE
MOVE THAT GOT YOU HERE.

63
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:15,338
THIS SEASON IS CALLED "SURVIVOR:
GAME CHANGERS"

64
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,342
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OZZY, HOW MUCH TIME WHEN YOU'RE

65
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,513
NOT PLAYING "SURVIVOR" IS SPENT
THINKING ABOUT THE MISTAKES I'VE

66
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,681
MADE?

67
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,809
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE SOME CRAZY
DREAM, WAKE UP SWEATING WITH

68
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,853
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SLIPPING
THROUGH MY FINGERS, BUT I ALSO

69
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,023
HAVE AMAZING MEN RISK AND
SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER GIVE UP.

70
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,860
>> Jeff: J.T., DOES IT MATTER
THAT THERE ARE HANDFUL OF

71
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,698
WINNERS HERE, THAT YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S WON THE

72
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,865
$1 MILLION?

73
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,367
>> I THINK IT'S GREAT I'M NOT
THE ONLY WINNER HERE, BUT I

74
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,079
DON'T THINK IT MATTERS AT ALL.

75
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,040
SANDRA IS NOT GOING TO BE THE
ONLY TWO-TIME WINNER, I THINK.

76
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,376
>> Jeff: WOW.

77
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,337
CIRIE, IF J.T. IS RIGHT, YOU
HAVE NO SHOT.

78
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,048
>> WHO SAYS J.T. IS RIGHT?

79
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,093
>> Jeff: ZEKE, FRESH OFF
PLAYING IN MILLENNIALS VS. GEN

81
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,514

"SURVIVOR"?

82
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:11,102
>> YEAH, JEFF, I MEAN, AS A FAN,
I'M GEEKING OUT QUITE A BIT

83
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,856
RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK, YEAH,

84
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,441
BOAT, AND I INTEND TO PROVE THAT
I DO.

00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,400

HE'S OUT QUICKLY.

117
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,805
AND NOBODY IS GOING AFTER HIM.

118
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,014

EVERYONE HERE IS A SNAKE IN THE
GRASS, AND I'M LIKE THE COBRA

163
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,874

169
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,721
THIS SEASON I BELIEVE MY BEST
SHOT AT WINNING IS GOING TO BE

170
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,682
LITERALLY SCHMOOZING UP TO
EVERYBODY HERE AND MAKING THEM

171
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,725
FEEL AWESOME.

172
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:48,272
>> IS YOUR NAME TOYS FOR TROYZAN
>> I THINK IT IS.

173
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,440
>> IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME?

174
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,901
>> ANY TIME SOMEBODY STARTS
TALKING TO ME I'M GOING TO GO

175
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,738
LIKE THIS BECAUSE I CAN'T
CONTROL MY FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

176
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,240
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO
LIE.

177
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,535
>> THERE'S A LOT OF HUGE BAMBOO.

178
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,121
>> I IMAGINE WE'RE DOING IT LIKE
RIGHT HERE.

179
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,541
>> YEAH, LOOK AT THOSE LOW ONES
RIGHT THERE, YOU COULD...

180
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,584
>> OH, THESE TWO?

181
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,877
>> HEY, YOU GUYS DO NICE, NICE.

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,795
I'M OUT.

183
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,921
I'M LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

184
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,758
>> WHERE'S HE GOING IN
>> HE SAID, I'M OUT, I'M LOOKING

185
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,510
FOR THE IDOL.

186
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,053
>> HE'S SERIOUS, THOUGH.

187
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,765
>> I BET HE IS.

188
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,808
>> WE'RE GOING TO VOTE HIM OFF
FIRST.

189
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,394
>> SHOULD WE LET HIM GO?

190
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:32,233
>> YEAH, HE'S MAKING HIMSELF A
TARGET.

191
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,901
>> I THOUGHT THEY WOULD ALL BE
CHASING ME.

192
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,780
>> IF HE FINDS IT, AT LEAST
WE'LL KNOW HE HAS IT.

193
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,493
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT BIG BAD
MANIAC SCREAMS, I'M GOING FOR

194
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,661
THE IDOL.

195
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,997
>> YOU ALL GO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
SO WE KNOW IF HE GETS IT.

196
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:51,627
IF YOU'RE GOING TO CALL A SEASON
ACCOUNT GAME CHANGERS" I THINK

197
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,964
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR ME TO
GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE LION'S DEN

198
00:11:55,047 --> 00:12:00,970
AND NOT BE PULLING A TONY WHO IS
FREAKING OUT EVERYONE AT CAMP

199
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,972
WITH ALL OF HIS IDOL HUNTING.

200
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,016
>> I JUST WANTED TO WALK AROUND
AND LOOK AT THE SCENERY AND THE

201
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,519
LANDSCAPE.

202
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,812
OH, MAN, THEY'RE REALLY NOT
COMING.

203
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,939
I WAS GOING TO RATTLE THEM A
LITTLE BIT.

204
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,859
SO I WAS THINKING THEY WERE ALL
GOING TO CHASE ME, AND IF THEY

205
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,696
WERE CHASING, I WOULD STOP AND
SAY, I'M MESSING YOU.

206
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,323
BUT THEY WEREN'T CHASING ME, SO
I SAID, LET ME TAKE ADVANTAGE

207
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,160
AND START LOOKING FOR THE IDOL
FOR SURE, YOU KNOW.

208
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,120
>> HE WASN'T GOING NOWHERE.

209
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,874
NOBODY WAS GOING TO VOTE HIS ASS
OFF OR NOTHING.

210
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,460
EVERYONE IS ALREADY TALKING
ABOUT WE CAN'T TRUST TONY, LOOK

211
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,336
AT WHAT HE'S DOING.

212
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,881
BUT I DON'T KNOW WE CAN HURRY UP
AND TAKE TONY OUT.

213
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,465
WE NEED HIM.

214
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,759
HE'S A PHYSICAL PLAYER.

215
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,427
WE NEED STRENGTH.

216
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,846
>> YOU GOT EVERYBODY PARANOID.

217
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,057
>> WHO THEY PISSED OFF AT, NOT
ME?

218
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,351
>> THEY'RE LIKE, SOMEONE GO
WATCH HIM.

219
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,853
OH, MY GOD.

220
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,356
>> YOU GUYS WATCH ME WHILE WE
LOOK FOR THE IDOL.

221
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,816
>> I LIKE TONEY.

222
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,067
HE'S GOT HIGH SPIRITS.

223
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,069
DAY ONE, PARANOIA, STIRRING UP
TROUBLE.

224
00:12:59,153 --> 00:12:59,904
>> ALL RIGHT.

225
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,990
LET'S GRAB SOME BAMBOO AND GO
BACK.

226
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:07,703
>> ALL I CAN SAY, THAT'S TONY
FOR YOU, YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT

227
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:17,796
ANYTHING LESS, BUT HE'S GOT A
BIG TARGET ON HIS BACK.

228
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:26,388
ANYTHING LESS, BUT HE'S GOT A
BIG TARGET ON HIS BACK.

229
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,182
>> GREAT JOB, MAN.

230
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,058
AWESOME JOB.

231
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,726
>> OH, MY GOD.

232
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,727
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

233
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,020
>> NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

234
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:37,942
>> I'M HERE THE SLAY EVERYONE
AND THE WIN A MILLION DOLLARS,

235
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:38,817
RIGHT?

236
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,070
BUT I HAVE LIKE THE GREATEST
TRIBE EVER.

237
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,073
I GOT THE GODDESS CIRIE.

238
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,077
>> CIRIE.

239
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,454
I'VE GOT OZZY.

240
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,581
I'VE GOT J.T.

241
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,750
I'M PLAYING SURROUNDED BY GAME
CHANGERS.

242
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,545
PART OF ME HAS TO KEEP SLAPPING
MYSELF AND BEING LIKE, YOU'RE

243
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,754
OUT HERE, TOO.

244
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,258
IF YOU BELONG OUT HERE, YOU NEED
TO ACT LIKE IT.

245
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,093
SO I WANT TO GET MY HANDS DIRTY.

246
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,054
I WANT THE LATHER MYSELF IN THE
BLOOD OF MY ENEMY, RIGHT?

247
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:11,100
LIKE I WANT TO CHANGE THE GAME.

248
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,061
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT
"SURVIVOR."

249
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,771
>> LOOK AT THAT.

250
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,605
LOOK, A GOAT.

251
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,108
>> THERE ARE THREE GOATS OVER
HERE.

252
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:19,942
THREE GOATS.

253
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,068
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN GET THAT
GOAT.

254
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:21,527
>> NO WAY.

255
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,904
>> THERE'S IN WAY.

256
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,573
YOU KNOW HOW FAST THEY GO.

257
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,118
>> LISTEN, LISTEN, I THINK TO
KILL A GOAT WE'D HAVE TO KILL

258
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:29,535
TAI.

259
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,453
>> THERE YOU GO.

260
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:31,954
SWEET.

261
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,456
>> WHAT'S IN THERE?

262
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,417
WE GOT TONS OF NAILS AND
HAMMERS.

263
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,960
WE CAN HAMMER AND NAIL.

264
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:38,711
WE GOT ALL THE TOOLS.

265
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,087
>> LET'S DO IT.

266
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,630
>> ALL RIGHT.

267
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,091
>> I PLAYED "SURVIVOR" CAGAYAN.

268
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,010
I HAVE A ME UNTIL NAL SOCIAL
GAME.

269
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,761
I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

270
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:53,017
SO I CAN READ PEOPLE, AND WITH A
SEASON CALLED "GAME CHANGERS," I

271
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,936
FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY WILL GET
ANXIOUS AND FEEL AS THOUGH THEY

272
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,189
NEED TO MAKE A MOVE, WHICH WILL
PUT A TARGET ON THEIR BACK, AND

273
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:05,487
THEN I'M GOING TO BE THE SILENT
ASSASSIN.

274
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,991
>> FINDING THE SECRET ADVANTAGE
IS JUST GIVING ME THIS

275
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,159
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING BIG.

276
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:17,499
AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED
TO DO WITH MY GAME THIS TIME

277
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,542
AROUND.

278
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,627
CONGRATULATION, YOU FOUND THE
LEGACY ADVANTAGE.

279
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,172
WITH THIS NOTE IN YOUR
POSSESSION, YOU ARE GUARANTEED

280
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,340
IMMUNITY, BUT IT COMES WITH A
TWIST.

281
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,051
YOU MAY ONLY USE IT WHEN THERE
ARE 13 PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME

282
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,137
OR WHEN THERE ARE SIX PEOPLE
LEFT IN THE GAME, AND IF YOU ARE

283
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,183
VOTED OUT, YOU MUST WILL THIS
ADVANTAGE TO ANOTHER PLAYER

284
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,684
STILL IN THE GAME FROM ANY
TRIBE.

285
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,687
THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE OPENS UP A
LOT OF DOORS FOR ME.

286
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,521
I'M ALREADY A STRONG COMPETITOR.

287
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,316
I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO DO IT
SOCIALLY.

288
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,400
I'M A COWGIRL.

289
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,320
LIKE MY JOB IS WORKING WITH GUYS
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE.

290
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,031
MY COMFORT IS HANGING OUT WITH
THE GUY, SO I GOT TO KEEP THEM

291
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,740
CLOSE.

292
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,034
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ON MY TRIBE.

293
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,662
>> LISTEN, I HAVE TO PLAY WITH
PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF.

294
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,081
>> HAVE YOU TALK TO THE OZZY AT
ALL?

295
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,707
>> HE'S GREAT.

296
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,750
IN BLOOD VS. WATER, IT WAS SO
DIFFICULT.

297
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:04,046
I HAD MY WIFE MONICA ON ONE SIDE
AND I HAD MY SIDE.

298
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,255
I WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE.

299
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,217
THIS TIME I'M TRYING TO LET
EVERYBODY COME TO ME, AND I FIND

300
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,389
MYSELF SAYING, W.W.M.D., WHAT
WOULD MONICA DO.

301
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,225
AND I PROMISE YOU, SHE WOULD BE
SLOW PLAYING THIS RIGHT NOW.

302
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:23,399
I GOT A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT I
THINK I'M OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT.

303
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,569
>> OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO BE A TEAM
PLAYER, BUT YOU DO ALSO HAVE TO

304
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,322
HAVE WITHIN THAT TRIBE YOUR CORE
NUMBERS.

305
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:30,906
SURE.

306
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,033
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

307
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:33,826
>> FOR SURE.

308
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,786
>> I THINK MY COMPETITION IS
FIERCE.

309
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,580
IN "SURVIVOR," BIG MOVES ALWAYS
REQUIRE BIG RISKS.

310
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,417
A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE NOT
SUCCESSFUL, BUT IF YOU DON'T

311
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,253
MAKE THEM, YOUR CHANCES OF
WINNING THE GAME ARE VERY SMALL.

312
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,924
>> THE ONLY ONE THAT I REALLY
GET A LITTLE BIT SCARED OF

313
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:49,466
HONESTLY IS CIRIE.

314
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,676
>> I DO, TOO.

315
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,180
>> CIRIE AND I PLAYED TOGETHER
ON FANS VERSUS FAVORITES, AND

316
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,933
CIRIE HELPED TO GET ME OUT.

317
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,518
I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN TRUST HER.

318
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,272
SO THIS TIME AROUND AS A GAME
CHANGER, I NEED TO BE THE MASTER

319
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,649
OF BLIND SIDES.

320
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,775
IF WE LOSE AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, CIRIE IS GOING TO GO.

321
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,167
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.

322
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,295
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A HELL OF A
HOUSE WHEN YOU FINISH.

323
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,339
I THINK IT'S GOOD THE SAY YOU
CAN PUT THE PAST ASIDE, BUT I

324
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:36,472
KNEW IT WAS A PROBLEM WHEN I SAW
IVY ON THE SAME TRIBE AS ME.

325
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,389
I DIDN'T START THE BLIND SIDE.

326
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,310
I PARTICIPATED.

327
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,187
BUT THAT WAS EIGHT YEARS OR
SOMETHING.

328
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,146
GET OVER IT.

329
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,399
>> SO WE GOOD, OZZY?

330
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,442
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

331
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:52,029
YOU COMING IN HERE WITH BAGGAGE?

332
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,989
>> WHAT WAS IT?

333
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:54,656
EIGHT YEARS AGO?

334
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,366
>> I WANT A CLEAN SLATE.

335
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:02,873
I'M JUST SEEING WHERE EVERYBODY
IS.

336
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,668
IT FELT LIKE WE WERE SOLID, SO
MAYBE EVERYBODY WILL REMAIN

337
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,796
CALM.

338
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,380
>> I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE
DIFFERENCES.

339
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:14,343
>> WELL, THE THING IS WITH ME
AND CIRIE, IT REALLY WASN'T

340
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,804
ANYTHING BECAUSE SHE WASN'T...

341
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,349
SHE JUST WENT ALONG WITH WHAT MY
ALLIANCE DECIDED TO DO, SO I

342
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,311
CAN'T HOLD THAT AGAINST HER, BUT
SHE'S JUST NOT A PHYSICAL

343
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,813
PLAYER.

344
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,357
SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE A REALLY
PHYSICAL PLAYER.

345
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,279
>> I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH
J.T., OZZY, HE KEEP BRINGING

346
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,906
CIRIE UP.

347
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,866
HE AND CIRIE HAVE HISTORY.

348
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,996
HE DOESN'T TRUST CIRIE, BUT I
LIKE CIRIE, SO I DON'T WANT TO

349
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,375
GET CAUGHT IN SOMETHING THAT
SUDDENLY THEY SAY CIRIE HAVE TO

350
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:55,384
GO.

351
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,010
>> I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

352
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,178
>> I'M NOT WORRIED.

353
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:03,767
>> I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO
WORRY.

354
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,395
>> SO WHEN YOU TALKED TO OZZY
THIS MORNING, YOU GOT A FEELING

355
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:18,532
THAT I STILL NEED TO WORK IT OUT
WITH HIM?

356
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,575
THAT PAUSE IS GIVING ME CONCERN.

357
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,243
>> IT'S JUST A VIBE.

358
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,414
I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS... IF
YOU TALK TO HIM, THAT'S WHY I'M

359
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,040
TRYING TO CONFER WITH YOU GUYS.

360
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,711
>> I KNOW, BUT WHEN YOU TALKED
TO HIM, YOU STILL GOT A VIBE

361
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:37,926
THAT THERE'S UNRESOLVED ISSUES
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

362
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,138
SO JUST HEARING THE WAY OZZY IS
FEELING ABOUT ME, I KNOW THAT

363
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,932
IT'S GOING THE TAKE SOMETHING
MORE THAN JUST A CONVERSATION WE

364
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,850
HAD.

365
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,102
LISTEN, THE WAR IS GOING TO
START ANYWAY.

366
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,605
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF
THE WAR STARTS TONIGHT OR

367
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,272
TOMORROW?

368
00:19:50,355 --> 00:20:03,368
THERE WILL BE BLOOD EITHER WAY.

369
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,968
>> ANYBODY NEED A REFILL OF
WATER?

370
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,679
I'M GOING TO GO GET SYSTEM
WATER.

371
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,055
>> PLEASE.

372
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,014
>> ANYBODY?

373
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,476
WATER?

374
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,190
>>WE'RE ALL GAME CHANGERS HERE,
WE KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS.

375
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:46,328
SO WHEN ALL THESE BUMS ARE
TALKING, TONY IS ALWAYS WORKING.

376
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,498
I WENT TO DIG A BUNKER NEXT TO
THE WATER WELL SO I CAN GO UNDER

377
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,375
THE GROUND WHERE NOBODY IS GOING
TO EXPECT IT, BECAUSE THEY'RE

378
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,335
GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR SPY
SHACKS.

379
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:59,508
THEY AIN'T GOING TO BE LOOKING
FOR AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER.

380
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,803
THE BEST QUALITY I HAVE FOR THIS
GAME IS WHAT'S NEEDED TO WIN

381
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,387
THIS GAME.

382
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,222
AND THAT'S ADAPTABILITY.

383
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,724
IF THEY GET FOOLED AGAIN, THAT'S
SHAME ON THEM.

384
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,977
THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH IT IF YOU
LOSE.

385
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,733
I WOULD NEVER DO IT IF I DIDN'T
THINK I COULD WIN.

386
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,194
>> TONY IS THE BIGGEST THREAT
HERE.

387
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,571
HE'S PROBABLY THE NUMBER-ONE
GAME CHANGER, AND LOOK, I

388
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:27,244
ALREADY CAUGHT HIM DIGGING IN
PLACES LIKE THE IDOL WEASEL.

389
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,412
HE'S JUST OUT OF CONTROL.

390
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,371
>> WHAT'S UP, TONY?

391
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,540
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHT, BRO?

392
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,460
AND THEN HE ACTED LIKE, HEY,
BRO, WHAT'S UP?

393
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:40,882
I'M LIKE, I DIDN'T CONFRONT HIM,
BUT HE HAS... WHEN HE'S GUILTY,

394
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,219
HE HAS A FANTASTIC GUILTY FACE.

395
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:51,685
BUT I GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL
WITH A GUY LIKE THAT.

396
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,354
>> RIGHT IN THERE DIGGING LIKE A
CRAZY MAN.

397
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,940
I DON'T KNOW IF HE FOUND
SOMETHING, BUT THAT'S ALL DUG

398
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,774
OUT.

399
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,069
>> YOU WOULD NEED A CLUE TO DIG
THERE.

400
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,071
HOW DID HE GET A CLUE?

401
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,032
>> HE'S DIGGING IN THE MIDDLE OF
NOWHERE.

402
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,577
>> WHAT DO WE EXPECT?

403
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,246
APPARENTLY TROY CAUGHT TONY
DIGGING IN THE IDOL IN THE

404
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,247
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

405
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,250
>> I PLAYED "SURVIVOR" A FEW
TIMES WITH WINNERS.

406
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,711
I PLAYED WITH TINA.

407
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,755
AND I THINK I HAVE THAT
ADVANTAGE WHERE I KIND OF KNOW

408
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,505
HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT.

409
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:27,262
>> TONY I GUARANTEE YOU IS
LOOKING.

410
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,764
TONY'S PLAYED ONE TIME AND HE'S
WON.

411
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:33,935
SO HE'S C&MING IN EXTREMELY
ARROGANT AND HE'S ALREADY PRETTY

412
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,562
CLOSE.

413
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:40,442
AND I AM SO EXCITED TO TEACH HIM
A LITTLE LESSON.

414
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,279
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
TONY.

415
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:48,909
LIKE JUST LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

416
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,410
>> YOU SAW THAT?

417
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,453
>> JUST NOW.

418
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,455
THE OPTIONS ARE GET RID OF HIM
OR GET RID OF CALEB.

419
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:58,752
>> I DON'T THINK WE CAN GET RID
OF CALEB, HE'S TOO STRONG

420
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,961
CHALLENGE-WISE.

421
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:05,509
>> I'M THINKING IF WE'RE IFFY
ABOUT TONY HAVING AN IDOL, WE

422
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,593
SHOULD GET RID OF HIS RIGHT-HAND
MAN.

423
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,346
>> IT'S OPEN SEASON.

424
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,598
NAMES ARE STARTING TO BE THROWN
OUT, CALEB, TONY.

425
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,477
THOSE ARE TWO PEOPLE I DON'T
WANT TO GO AT ALL, BUT I KNOW

426
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,857
THE PERSON THROWING THESE NAMES
OUT IS CIERA.

427
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,317
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

428
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,485
>> CIERA SEEMS TO BE VERY GAMEY.

429
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,821
THAT'S MY GUT.

430
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,740
>> STRATEGICALLY FOR MY GAME,
I'M WHERE I WANT TO BE.

431
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,661
EVERYONE IS TALKING TO ME, BUT
IF CIERA IS GOING TO PUSH US OUT

432
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,123
OF ZEN MODE ON THIS TRIBE, IT
MAKES IT EASY TO TARGET HER

433
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,207
EARLY.

434
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:13,326
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

435
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,452
ALL RIGHT.

436
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,581
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

437
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,206
>> YEAH.

438
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,708
>> YEAH.

439
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,210
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'RE GOING TO RACE

440
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,713
TO A RAFT AND PADDLE OUT TO A
PLATFORM.

441
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:30,385
ONE PERSON WILL THEN SWIM OUT
THE RETRIEVE A SET OF KEYS.

442
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:36,433
YOU'LL ALL MAKE YOUR WAY OVER A
SERIES OF OBSTACLES BACK TO THE

443
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,309
BEACH.

444
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:42,397
YOU'LL DIG UP TWO BAGS OF PUZZLE
PIECES.

445
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,774
YOU'LL THEN USE THE KEYS TO
UNLOCK THE CHEST, WHICH WILL

446
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:49,196
RELEASE THE THIRD BAG OF PIECES.

447
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,242
YOU'LL USE THE PIECES INSIDE THE
BAGS TO FORM A SHIP'S WHEEL

448
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,410
PUZZLE.

449
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,747
FIRST TRIBE TO SOLVE THEIR
PUZZLE AND RAISE THEIR FLAG WINS

450
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,623
IMMUNITY.

451
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:04,753
THIS IS THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

452
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,045
>> OH, WOW.

453
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,755
>> WOW.

454
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,299
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: WITH THIS IN YOUR

455
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,928
POSSESSION, YOU CANNOT BE VOTED
OUT.

456
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,763
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL.

457
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,099
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:

458
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,309
GAME CHANGERS."

459
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,854
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
FIRE IN THE FORM OF FLIPGHT.

460
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,440
THERE IS A TWIST TO THIS SEASON.

461
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:29,444
THIS SEASON IN THE EVENT OF A
TIE VOTE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

462
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,820
THERE WILL BE NO REVOTE.

463
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:35,784
WE WILL GO IMMEDIATELY TO A
TIEBREAKER.

464
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:40,622
THAT MEANS IF THERE IS A TIE,
YOU'LL HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION

465
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,251
AT TRIBAL IN FROM THE OF
EVERYBODY, AND IF YOU CAN

466
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:49,297
UNANIMOUSLY AGREE ON WHICH OF
THE TRIBE MEMBERS WHO ARE TIED

467
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,590
TO SEND HOME, THEY GO HOME.

468
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,302
IF YOU CAN'T UNANIMOUSLY AGREE,
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TIED ARE NOW

469
00:25:54,386 --> 00:26:00,308
SAFE, EVERYBODY ELSE DRAWS ROCKS
AND SOMEBODY GOES HOME.

470
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,643
ANDREW, WHAT IMPACT INITIALLY DO
YOU SEE THIS HAVING?

471
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:07,649
>> IT WORRIES ME BECAUSE THERE
MIGHT BE AN IDOL AND LET'S SPLIT

472
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,694
THE VOTE, BUT NOW SPLITTING THE
VOTE IS VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE

473
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,154
YOU COULD BE THE ONE PULLING THE
ROCK.

474
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:13,989
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

475
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,782
GIVE YOU GUYS A MINUTE THE
STRATEGIZE.

476
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:22,747
WE'LL GET STARTED.

477
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,630
ALL RIGHT.

478
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,506
HERE WE GO.

479
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:37,304
FOR REWARD AND IMMUNITY,
SURVIVORS READY?

480
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,848
GO!

481
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,184
SEVEN FROM EACH TRIBE ON THE
RAFT FOR THE FIRST LEG.

482
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,646
GOT TO PADDLE OUT TO THAT
PLATFORM.

483
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,649
THESE RAFTS ARE HEAVY.

484
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,027
ONCE YOU'RE IN THE WATER, START
PADDLING.

485
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,986
LET'S GO.

486
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:53,403
EVERYBODY ON.

487
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,073
>> GO, GUYS GO.

488
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,993
YOU'VE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY ON
THE PLATFORM BEFORE THE SWIMMER

489
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:00,827
CAN GO.

490
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,079
>> RIGHT SIDE, RIGHT SIDE.

491
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,374
>> Jeff: NUKU VERY CLOSE TO
THEIR PLATFORM.

492
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,501
MANA IS NOW AT THAT PLATFORM.

493
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,254
EVERYBODY ON THAT PLATFORM.

494
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,340
OZZY'S IN THE WATER.

495
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:13,965
HALI IN THE WATER FOR MANA.

496
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,385
>> GREAT JOB, HALI, COME ON.

497
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,014
>> Jeff: IT'S OZZY AND HALI
RIGHT NOW IN A SHOWDOWN GOING

498
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:21,639
FOR THOSE KEYS.

499
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,098
>> LET'S GO, OZZY.

500
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,892
>> GOOD JOB, HALI.

501
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,560
>> LET'S GO, HALI.

502
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,895
>> YOU'RE RIGHT ON HIM.

503
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,562
YES!

504
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,439

HALI HAS HERS UNTIED.

507
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,902

510
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:43,411

511
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:43,787
OZZY'S BACK.

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,413

EVERYBODY OVER.

519
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,719
NUKU NOW WORKING ON THAT BARREL.

520
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:04,265
IT IS A LONG SWIM, A LOT OF
ADRENALINE.

521
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,976
NUKU TOSSING PEOPLE OVER.

NUKU NOW HITS THE NET.

525
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,322
STILL WITH THE LEAD.

526
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:19,906
MANA HAS ONE PERSON LEFT.

527
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,408
THERE HE IS.

528
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,117
LET'S GO, MANA.

529
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,495
GOT TO GET EVERYBODY TO THE MAT.

530
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,871
>> KEEP GOING.

531
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,790

532
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,874
>> Jeff: GO.

533
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,960
START DIGGING, TWO PEOPLE.

00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,810
CULPEPPER GOING TO GET OUT FOR
NUKU.

00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:54,357
CIERA COMING IN FOR CULL PEPPER.

541
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,817
MANA WILL NOW SWITCH OUT.

542
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,989
LAST TIME CALEB DID THIS, HE WAS
EVACUATED FROM EXHAUSTION.

543
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,907
TAI HAS THE SECOND BAG.

544
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,702

545
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,620

547
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,292
LOCKS.

00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,209
CALEB HAS FIRST BAG.

549
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,170
HE'S GOING TO SWAP OUT.

550
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,129
MALCOLM BACK IN WITH TONY.

551
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,047
>> I GOT IT.

552
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,174
>> Jeff: THEY'VE GOT IT.

553
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,216
LET'S GO.

554
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,135
MANA, YOU'RE BACK IN THIS.

555
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,346
DEBBIE STILL WORKING ON THOSE
LOCKS.

556
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,973
THAT HAS OPENED THE DOOR FOR
MANA NOW.

557
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,641
>> WE'RE RIGHT IN IT.

558
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,684
>> I GOT ONE.

559
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:30,852
>> THAT A BOY, JEFF.

560
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,647
>> Jeff: VARNER QUICKLY GETS
FIRST LOCK FOR MANA, AND JUST

561
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,191
LIKE THAT, MANA IS NOW IN THE
LEAD.

562
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,066
>> DON'T PANIC.

563
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,026
STAY CALM.

564
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:43,364
>> Jeff: NUKU HAD A HUGE HEAD
START.

565
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,534
>> DEBBIE FEELING THE PRESSURE.

566
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,912
>> Jeff: VARNER STARTING TO
PANIC.

567
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:49,996
>> I AIN'T PANICKING.

568
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,582
DON'T THROW THAT [BLEEPED] ON
ME.

569
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,458
I'M GOOD.

570
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,876
>> Jeff: NUKU HAS THEIR SECOND
LOCK OPEN.

571
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,920
NUKU BACK IN THE LEAD NOW.

572
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,213
START WORKING ON THE PUZ.

573
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,258
IT IS CIRIE AND ZEKE WORKING ON
THE PUZZLE FOR NUKU.

574
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,094
VARNER STILL TRYING TO OPEN THAT
SECOND LOCK FOR MANA.

575
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,056
FIRST PART OF THIS PUZZLE IS THE
OUTER RING OF THE SHIP'S WHEEL.

576
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,891
>> GOT IT.

577
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,851
>> GOT IT?

578
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,353
>> Jeff: VARNER HAS THE SECOND
LOCK.

579
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,187
THERE YOU GO.

580
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,773
START WORKING ON THE PUZZLE.

581
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,482
IT IS CIRIE AND ZEKE.

582
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,901
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

583
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,113
>> Jeff: AND SIERRA AND
SANDRA.

584
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,907
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS.

585
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:33,248
CIRIE AND ZEKE HAD A BIT OF A
LEAD, BUT SIERRA AND SANDRA

586
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,749
QUICKLY CAUGHT UP.

587
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:38,920
SIERRA AND SANDRA HAVE BEEN
BEHIND AND HAVE HAD TO CATCH UP

588
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,796
THIS ENTIRE CHALLENGE.

589
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,091
CAN THEY DO IT NOW WHEN IT
REALLY MATTERS?

590
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,886
ZEKE AND CIRIE HAVE FIRST
SECTION.

591
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,764
SIERRA AND SANDRA HAVE THEIR
FIRST SECTION.

592
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:52,058
ONCE AGAIN WE'RE DEAD EVEN IN
THIS FIRST CHALLENGE.

593
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:56,104
NOW WORKING ON THE SPOKES, THE
SECOND SECTION OF THE SHIP'S

594
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,355
WHEEL.

595
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:01,442
SIERRA HAS DONE THIS PUZZLE ONCE
BEFORE AGAINST HER MOM AND LOST.

596
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,444
CAN SHE PULL IT OFF THIS TIME?

597
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,989
ZEKE AND CIRIE MAKING PROGRESS
IF THEY'RE RIGHT.

598
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,075
YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU'RE
COMPLETELY FINISHED IF ALL THE

599
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:13,162
PIECE GOSS WHERE THEY NEED TO
BE.

600
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,206
ZEKE AND CIRIE THINK THEY HAVE
IT.

601
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:15,957
WILL IT FIT?

602
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,792
IS IT RIGHT?

603
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:18,835
>> YES, IT WILL.

604
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,836
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

605
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,087
>> Jeff: IT'S NOT RIGHT.

606
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,088
SOMETHING'S OFF.

607
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,673
THEY HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE
DRAWING BOARD AGAIN.

608
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,633
THAT OPENS THE DOOR ONCE AGAIN
FOR MANA.

609
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,926
>> COME ON, HURRY.

610
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,802
>> THAT'S IT.

611
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:28,970
THIS IS IT.

612
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,639
>> Jeff: SAN DR. AND SIERRA
THINK THEY HAVE FIGURED IT OUT

613
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,015
NOW.

614
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:32,432
>> YOU GOT IT.

615
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,475
>> YES, HERE.

616
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,978
>> Jeff: ZEKE AND CIRIE THINK
THEY FIGURED IT OUT NOW.

617
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:41,024
SUDDENLY BOTH PAIRS HAVE SOME
MOMENTUM.

618
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:41,608
ARE THEY RIGHT?

619
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,318
>> YES.

620
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,863
>> Jeff: AND THEY ARE, ZEKE
AND CIRIE ARE MOVING ON TO THE

621
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,739
THIRD AND FINAL BAG.

622
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,781
THESE ARE THE HANDLES.

623
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,450
THIS WILL FINISH IT RIGHT HERE.

624
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,620
SAN DR. AND SIERRA NOW HAVE TO
MOVE QUICKLY.

625
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,957
IT WON'T TAKE MUCH TIME FOR THIS
LAST BIT.

626
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,291
>> YOU GOT IT.

627
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,083
GREAT JOB.

628
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,836
>> Jeff: CIRIE HAS THE LAST
HANDLE.

629
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,258
SANDRA GIVING IT A GO.

630
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:07,967
NUKU HAS IT.

631
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,177
THIS WILL DO IT.

632
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,095
>> SPIN THAT WHEEL, YEAH!

633
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:17,060
>> Jeff: REWARD AND IMMUNITY
FOR NUKU, AND THE FIRST

634
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:27,320
CHALLENGE IN "SURVIVOR: GAME
CHANGERS."

635
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,238
NUKU, CONGRATULATIONS.

636
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,200
OUT OF THE GATE IMMUNITY IS
YOURS.

637
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,244
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

638
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,204
>> Jeff: AND FLINT.

639
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,539
>> THANK YOU.

640
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,041
>> Jeff: NICE CATCH, DEBBIE.

641
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,709
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

642
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,502
NOBODY GOING HOME.

643
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,878
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

644
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:44,504
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

645
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,215
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

646
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,552
ALL RIGHT, MANA, LIKE IT OR NOT,
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST

647
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,514
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
GAME CHANGERS."

648
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,099
GRAB YOU STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

649
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,350
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

650
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,770
>> THIS IS A PUZZLE I HAD DONE
BEFORE, AND I LOST THE PUZZLE TO

651
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,564
MY MOM, AND I TOTALLY LET
EVERYBODY DOWN.

652
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,694
AND IT'S JUST A CRAPPY FEELING
TO LOSE THE SAME PUZZLE TWO

653
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,903
TIMES.

654
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:12,907
I'M NERVOUS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
WANT TO BE FIRST VOTE OUT ON THE

655
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,991
GAME-CHANGING SEASON.

656
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,095
>> THAT WAS A DOOZY.

657
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,764
LOSING THE FIRST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE IS NOTHING NEW TO ME.

658
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,225
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO ME EVERY TIME I'VE EVER

659
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:39,684
PLAYED.

660
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,227
>> ANYBODY REFILL?

661
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,270
MALCOLM, YOU NEED A REFILL?

662
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,648
>> NOBODY WANTS TO BE THE FIRST
PERSON VOTED OUT.

663
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,818
TO EVEN HAVE TO GO TO THE FIRST
TRIBAL IS AWFUL F AWFUL.

664
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,237
AND EVEN THOUGH TONY IS A SNAKE,
NEW GUT IS TELLING ME TO KEEP

665
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,782
THE TRIBE STRONG.

666
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,284
>> THIS SUCKS, BRO.

667
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,785
I'M SO PISSED RIGHT NOW.

668
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,248
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE A
DECISION WHO WE DON'T FEEL

669
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,292
COMFORTABLE WITH AND SAY WE HAVE
TO GET RID OF THE WEAKEST

670
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:04,792
THREAT.

671
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,755
>> I FEEL LIKE SIERRA.

672
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,340
>> SHE'S THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S
THROWN NAMES OUT.

673
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:17,638
>> THAT'S THE ONLY PERSON WHO
HAS SAID ANYBODY'S NAME.

674
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,807
>> WHOSE NAME IN.

675
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,058
>> YOU TWO.

676
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,311
>> THE VOTE IS BETWEEN THE TWO
OF YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE DIGGING

677
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,479
FOR AN IDOL.

678
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:29,108
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GAME
CHANGING, YOU TALK ABOUT SIERRA.

679
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,318
SHE VOTED HER MOTHER OUT.

680
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,444
THAT SAYS A LOT.

681
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,236
SHE'S FLIP-FLOPPED.

682
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,781
SHE'S FORCED TIES.

683
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,323
SIERRA IS LIT.

684
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,200
>> SANDRA?

685
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:41,329
>> I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ALL
WANT?

686
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,499
>> WHOSE NAMES ARE OUT THERE AND
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I FEEL?

687
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:44,957
>> MINE.

688
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,167
>> WHO SAID YOU?

689
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,294
>> THE ONLY ONE THROWING NAMES
OUT IS SIERRA.

690
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,672
>> ONE PERSON.

691
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,341
FOR NO REASON.

692
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,467
>> HERE SHE COMES.

693
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,680
>> NO, HANG OUT, HANG OUT.

694
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,015
>> SAY MICHAELA.

695
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,016
SAY MICHAELA.

696
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,392
>> THIS SEASON THERE'S A LITTLE
TWIST HERE.

697
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:09,148
IN THE EVENT OF A TIE, THERE
WILL NOT BE A REVOTE, AND WE'LL

698
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,150
DRAW ROCKS RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

699
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,529
FOR ME IT'S A HUGE ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE I PLAY FEARLESSLY, AND

700
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,696
I'VE BEEN THERE.

701
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,282
SO I FEEL LIKE I WAS JUST HANDED
AN ADVANTAGE, BUT I KNOW I

702
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,368
DIDN'T PERFORM AT THAT
CHALLENGE, SO THE PRESSURE IS ON

703
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,372
FOR ME BECAUSE SOMETIMES EARLY
ON PEOPLE WANT THE KEEP THE

704
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,706
TRIBE STRONG.

705
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,375
>> WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
MICHAELA?

706
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,045
>> I THINK SHE'S
CONFRONTATIONAL.

707
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,004
>> I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

708
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:32,713
>> I'M GOOD.

709
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,090
>> SHE'S THE OUTCAST.

710
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,717
>> EVERYBODY MAJORITY WANTS TO
GET RID OF MICHAELA.

711
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,718
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

712
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:42,932
AT THIS POINT I'D BE FINE WITH
ANYBODY BUT MYSELF.

713
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,809
>> WE'RE CHECKING YOUR
TEMPERATURE.

714
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,726
>> OH, YEAH?

715
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,063
>> WELL, THEY SAID CIERA.

716
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,440
>> GOING ENTER TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT IS AN EASY VOTE.

717
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,193
THE NAME CIERA CAME UP.

718
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,195
I'M PERFECTLY FINE WITH THAT.

719
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,446
THAT'S WHO I WANTED TO GO HOME
FIRST.

720
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,866
>> I'M STAYING UNDER THE SHADE.

721
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,535
I FEEL LIKE MY BACK IS BAKING.

722
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:06,622
>> BUT WHO DOES SHE THINK IS
GOING HOME?

723
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,164
WHAT?

724
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:07,456
>> SHE VOTING FOR ME?

725
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,749
>> YEAH.

726
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,876
>> REALLY?

727
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,167
>> YEAH.

728
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:10,710
>> OKAY.

729
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,919
>> SHE'S THE ONLY ONE.

730
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,087
>> SHE'S THE ONLY ONE.

731
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,215
>> I DON'T LIKE IT.

732
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,386
>> WHO DOES SIERRA THINK
EVERYBODY ELSE IS VOTING FOR?

733
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,554
AND THAT FOOL SAYS ME.

734
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:27,476
>> DOES SHE THINK THAT ALL NINE
PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR ME?

735
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,270
MAN, WHY DID YOU ALL DO THAT?

736
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:33,232
>> SHE WANTED YOU SO WE SAID WE
AGREED.

737
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,401
>> I REACTED IN A WAY I
SHOULDN'T HAVE.

738
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:41,324
SO I'M NOT TRYING TO LET THEM
SEE HOW BIG MICHAELA CAN BE, BUT

739
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,243
SHE CAN'T CONTAIN GREATNESS, SO
IT CAME OUT.

740
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,286
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

741
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,787
>> DO YOU FEEL OKAY?

742
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,289
>> NO.

743
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:48,623
WHO WANTS THEIR NAME...

744
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,124
>> I KNOW.

745
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,417
I KNOW.

746
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,377
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, HONESTLY, IT
MIGHT CHANGE TO SOMEBODY ELSE IN

747
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,545
THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON.

748
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,633
>> YEAH, I THINK IT NEEDS TO
CHANGE TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE

749
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,009
COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON.

750
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,137
THAT WOULD BE IDEAL FOR MICHAELA
BRADSHAW.

751
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,473
>> MICHAELA IS DEFINITELY A
TRICKY ONE FOR US AS A TRIBE.

752
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:12,647
SHE HAS A BIT OF A HOT STREAK,
AND IF YOU IGNITE THAT THE WRONG

753
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,816
WAY, THE WHOLE PLACE IS BURNING
DOWN.

754
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,486
>> WOW, SHE'S SCARY, BREE.

755
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:23,282
>>FOR REAL, THAT'S SCARY.

756
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,492
MICHAELA IS FREAKING OUT.

757
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,869
>> I FIGURED MICHAELA WOULD BE
COOL.

758
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,496
LIKE I DIDN'T THINK SHE WOULD
BLOW UP ABOUT IT.

759
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,832
>> YEAH.

760
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,334
>> PEOPLE LIKE, THAT THEY GOT TO
GO.

761
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,338
>> THE PLAN IS CIERA IS GOING TO
GO HOME, BUT THE ONLY ISSUE IS

762
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,133
THE MINUTE THEY TOLD MICHAELA IT
WAS GOING TO BE CIERA BUT THAT

763
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,971
WE WERE GOING TO TELSEY SI IT
WAS MICHAELA, IT WAS A DIFFERENT

764
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:45,388
STORY.

765
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,097
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

766
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,889
>> I'M GOOD.

767
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,350
>> ARE YOU SURE?

768
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,187
>> MICHAELA WAS POUTING, MAKING
THESE FACES LIKE SHE WAS PISSED

769
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,230
OFF.

770
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,817
>> YOU ALL TALK ABOUT ANYTHING
SINCE I BEEN GONE?

771
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,029
>> WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, WE
COULD EASILY TAKE OUT CIERA SOME

772
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,239
OTHER TIME.

773
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,033
IF MICHAELA IS SOMEBODY THAT WE
NEED THE TAKE OUT, WE NEED TO

774
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:16,127
TAKE HER OUT QUICK, FAST, AND IN
A HURRY.

775
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:40,526
TAKE HER OUT QUICK, FAST, AND IN
A HURRY.

776
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,569
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.

777
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,406
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH, DIP
IT IN AND GET FIRE.

778
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,576
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THE

779
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,870
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

780
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:55,583
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

781
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,754
TONY, WHEN YOU HAVE A SEASON
CALLED GAME CHANGERS, THERE'S A

782
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,963
BIT OF AN EXPECTATION.

783
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,965
>> YEAH, IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

784
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,761
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DO MY
CRAZINESS AND THIS AND THAT.

785
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,471
THEY PUT THE BRAKES ON THAT REAL
QUICK.

786
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,223
IT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS IN CAGAYAN.

787
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,101
THESE ARE GAME CHANGERS, AND I'M
LIKE WHOA.

788
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,771
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, DID YOU SEE
TONY RACING AROUND TRYING TO

789
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,563
PUSH THE PACE?

790
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,899
>> LITERALLY.

791
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:23,277
WE WERE HERE FOR ALL OF TEN
SECOND, AND HE SAID, I'M GOING

792
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,655
FOR THE ITEM AND TOOK OFF INTO
THE WOODS.

793
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,117
I'M SURE IF I FIND IT IN THE
FIRST TEN SECOND, GAME CHANGER,

794
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,661
BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN ELEMENT OF
WE'RE ALL REALLY ENJOYING

795
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,122
OURSELVES AND TAKING IT LIKE A
GAME.

796
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,958
>> Jeff: AUBRY, HOW BIG A PART
DO YOU THINK IMPRESSIONS FROM

797
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,210
THE PAST WILL PLAY IN THIS GAME?

798
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:43,464
>> I THINK WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT
EACH OTHER SAYING, OKAY, THIS IS

799
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,927
A PERSON I SAW ON TV AND TRYING
THE FIGURE OUT IF THAT'S EXACTLY

800
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,638
WHAT WE THOUGHT THEY WERE OR IF
THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE

801
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,972
DIFFERENT.

802
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,142
>> Jeff: CALEB, YOU'RE IN AN
UNUSUAL SITUATION.

803
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,644
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT KIND OF
PLAYER YOU ARE STRATEGICALLY

804
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,146
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SHOW THEM.

805
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,608
>> YEAH, HONESTLY, JEFF, I THINK
IT CAN HELP ME BECAUSE THEY

806
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,652
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

807
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,863
AND I CAN LOOK AT THE OTHER
SIDE, AND IT MAY FRIGHTEN THEM A

808
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:08,948
LITTLE BIT.

809
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,574
>> Jeff: MICHAELA, WHAT
IMPRESSION DO YOU THINK THEY

810
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,660
HAVE OF YOU OUT OF THE GATE?

811
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,122
>> I HOPE I'VE MADE A GREAT
IMPRESSION, BUT I'M NOT PLAYING

812
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,708
WITH PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE MY
BEST FRIEND, LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT

813
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,960
TO GO.

814
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:25,714
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE PUNKISH
FOR THE FIRST VOTE ON A SEASON

815
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,592
CALLED GAME CHANGERS TO BE TOO
EASY OF ONE.

816
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,846
>> Jeff: SANDRA, THAT'S THE
KIND OF ANSWER A VERY

817
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,680
EXPERIENCED PLAYER GIVES.

818
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,975
>> JEFF, MICHAELA HAS BEEN A
PLEASURE.

819
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,060
I THINK THE GROUP LOVES HER.

820
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,311
I CARE FOR HER.

821
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,523
YOU KNOW, LIKE FROM THE LITTLE
TIME THAT WE HAVE BEEN WITH HER,

822
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,899
SHE IS A PLEASURE.

823
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:49,363
>> Jeff: BUT SAUNDRA, IT SEEMS
IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE THE

824
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,657
EASY VOTE, IT WOULD BE YOU, THE
TWO-TIME WINNER.

825
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,701
>> EVERYBODY LOVES ME, JEFF,
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

826
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,830
I AM THE PERFECT PERSON TO GO TO
THE END WITH BECAUSE WHO WILL

827
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:58,998
GIVE ME ANOTHER $1 MILLION?

828
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,667
AND THESE PEOPLE ARE PLAYING FOR
THE SECOND, THE THIRD, THE

829
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,751
FOURTH TIME.

830
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,712
HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU HAVE TO
PLAY TO GET YOUR MILLION

831
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,880
DOLLARS?

832
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,676
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT, DO IT
NOW AND DO IT WITH SANDRA?

833
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,887
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jeff: SO VARNER, WHAT

834
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,222
HAPPENED TODAY WHEN YOU GOT BACK
TO CAMP AFTER THE CHALLENGE?

835
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,684
>> WELL, A GROUP TOOK OFF TO THE
WELL TO DISCUSS WHAT ARE WE

836
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,562
GOING TO DO, HOW ARE WE GOING TO
DO IT.

837
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,731
SOMEBODY COMES DOWN THE WAY,
THEN YOU SEE ANOTHER GROUP TAKE

838
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,775
OFF DOWN THE BEACH, AND IT'S
LIKE, OH, HELL, WHAT'S HAPPENING

839
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,611
NOW?

840
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,737
IS THIS WHAT WE JUST TALKED
ABOUT?

841
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,905
IT'S VERY UNSETTLING.

842
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:35,743
>> Jeff: SO HALI, WHAT WILL
THE CRITERIA BE FOR TONIGHT'S

843
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,744
VOLT?

844
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,871
>> I THINK TONIGHT'S VOTE HAS
TWO COMPONENTS.

845
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,582
WE HAVE A CHALLENGES WEAKNESS
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT, WE WANT

846
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,875
THE KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG.

847
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,794
AND THEN ALSO PEOPLE GOT THEIR
FEATHERS RUFFLED BY SOME TALK

848
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:51,133
THAT WENT AROUND, AND I THINK
LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS.

849
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,803
I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT, TOO.

850
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,930
CIERA, WHY THE BIG REACTION?

851
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,766
>> I WASN'T SURE WHAT HALI WAS
TALKING ABOUT?

852
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,767
AM I IN THE MAJORITY?

853
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,851
WAIT A SECOND.

854
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,772
BUT I'M STILL GOING TO GO WITH
WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE

855
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,689
MAJORITY.

856
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,276
>> Jeff: SO MICHAELA, WE'RE
ABOUT TO VOTE.

857
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,487
ARE YOU NERVOUS THAT YOU MIGHT
BE THE MARK TONIGHT?

858
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,740
>> I'LL BE SURPRISED IF I GET
OUT OF HERE WITHOUT ONE VOTE

859
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,618
AGAINST ME.

860
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,787
>> Jeff: SANDRA, IF YOU HAD TO
PUT A CHAPTER TITLE ON THESE

861
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:25,793
FIRST THREE DAY, WHAT WOULD YOU
CALL IT?

862
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:30,130
>> THE UNKNOWN.

863
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,257
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

864
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,300
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

865
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:43,310
CALEB, YOU'RE UP.

866
00:42:55,447 --> 00:43:06,959
>> BYE, FELICIA.

867
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:15,759
>> A QUEEN STAYS QUEEN AND
ADIOS.

868
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:24,685
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

869
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,855
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

870
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,817
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

871
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,776
OKAY.

872
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,488
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

873
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,740
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

874
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,908
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

875
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,828
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

876
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:48,000
FIRST VOTE MICHAELA.

877
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,918
CIERA.

878
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,714
CIERA.

879
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,215
THAT'S THREE VOTES CIERA.

880
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,884
ONE VOTE MICHAELA.

881
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:57,885
CIERA.

882
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,930
FOUR VOTES CIERA.

883
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,182
CIERA.

884
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:07,895
THAT'S FIVE VOTES CIERA, ONE
VOTE MICHAELA.

885
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,857
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GAME CHANGERS,"

886
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,441
CIERA.

887
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,025
THAT'S SIX.

888
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:13,734
THAT'S ENOUGH.

889
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:23,077
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

890
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:28,791
CIERA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

891
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,043
>> GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.

892
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:31,668
GOOD JOB.

893
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:37,883
>> Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

894
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,886
WELL, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE
GAME OF "SURVIVOR" EVOLVES, ONE

895
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:47,768
THING ALWAYS REMAINS TRUE --
BLIND SIDES NEVER GO OUT OF

896
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,977
STYLE.

897
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,145
THE ONLY GOOD THING TO COME OUT
OF COMING THE TRIBAL COUNCIL,

898
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,272
FIRE IN THE FORM OF FLINT.

899
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,943
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

900
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:56,568
GOOD NIGHT.

901
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,362
>> JEFF, I WEAR GLASSES NOW.

902
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,978
>> LAST NIGHT'S TRIBAL WAS THE
SMOOTHEST TRIBAL I CAN REMEMBER.

903
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,896
IT WAS 9-1 UNANIMOUS.

904
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,106
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

905
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,484
RIGHT NOW EVERYONE IS WAITING
FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE THE FIRST

906
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,193
MOVE.

907
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,987
I'M BORED.

908
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,488
I'M TIRED OF JUST SITTING BACK.

909
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,948
I WANT TO GET INTO GEAR ALREADY.

910
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,576
THIS IS THE PART I SPECIALIZE
INCH I WANT THE JUMP INTO

911
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,368
ACTION.

912
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,203
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MAKE SOME
MOVES.

913
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,706
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS?

914
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,792
>> I FEEL GREAT AFTER LAST
NIGHT.

915
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,169
>> FORGET THAT.

916
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:55,752
THAT'S HISTORY.

917
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,171
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

918
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,297
I'M WILLING TO WORK FOR YOU.

919
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,883
>> I NEED YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE A
BIG THREAT.

920
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:04,344
>> AND I NEED YOU BECAUSE I'M A
BIG THREAT.

921
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,512
HOW ARE YOU WITH MALCOLM?

922
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,389
>> HE SEEMS COOL TO ME.

923
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,348
I TALKED TO TONY.

924
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,641
HE'S A THREAT IN THE GAME.

925
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,893
SO AM I.

926
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,686
AND I WANT THE PLAY WITH PEOPLE
WHO ARE THREATS BECAUSE I THINK

927
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,855
THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR ME
RIGHT NOW.

928
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,190
>> THERE'S NINE OF US.

929
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:20,027
RIGHT NOW WE NEED A MAJORITY
ALLIANCE OF FIVE.

930
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,987
ME, YOU, TWO.

931
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,530
>> I THINK MALCOLM.

932
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,531
>> THREE.

933
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,157
CALEB FOR SURE.

934
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,202
FOUR.

935
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,369
SANDRA?

936
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,205
ALL THE THREATS THAT ARE AROUND,
I WOULD LIKE THE KEEP THEM

937
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,372
AROUND BECAUSE THEY'RE SHIELDING
ME.

938
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,082
SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING
HERE.

939
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,377
AUBRY IS A BIG THREAT FOR BEING
A STRATEGIC BEAST.

940
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:42,216
MALCOLM AND CALEB BOTH HUGE
THREATS, AND SANDRA, THE BIGGEST

941
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,717
THREAT OF ANY RETURNING PLAYER.

942
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,552
YOU DON'T WIN TWICE BY A FLUKE.

943
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,554
RIGHT NEW IT'S STILL PEACEFUL.

944
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,931
SO WE HAVE THE SEE WHO IS
WEAKER?

945
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,391
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO SPLIT UP.

946
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,019
IT AIN'T GOING TO BE NINE, EIGHT
STRONG.

947
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:58,899
IN FACT, THE VERY NEXT ONE WILL
BE A 5-4, BECAUSE THESE

948
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,944
NON-WINNERS WILL NOT AWARD A
WINNER ANOTHER WIN.

949
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,696
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU THINK THAT'S
TRUE, BUT I THINK IT'S TRUE.

950
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,075
>> THE ONLY WAY A WINNER CAN WIN
IS THREE WINNERS AT THE END.

951
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,369
>> I WANT THE WORK WITH TONY.

952
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,119
HE'S A WINNER.

953
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,079
I'M A WINNER.

954
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,080
J.T. IS A WINNER.

955
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,499
WE HAVE TO PROTECT EACH OTHER
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

956
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,585
>> WE CAN'T START TAKING OUT THE
PHYSICAL PEOPLE BECAUSE WE'RE

957
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,419
GOING TO KEEP LOSING.

958
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,589
>> ME, YOU, AUBRY, MALCOLM,
CALEB.

959
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:28,136
>> IF YOU WANT ME AND IF WE CAN
BENEFIT EACH OTHER, THEN I'M IN.

960
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,597
TONY WANTS ME IN HIS ALLIANCE OF
FIVE.

961
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,765
MY GAME IS PRETTY SIMPLE.

962
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,101
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME, I DON'T
CARE WHO GOES HOME, WHICH I

963
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,310
REALLY DON'T.

964
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,106
>> IF I'M GOING TO GET TO THE
END, I'M NOT GOING WITH SOMEBODY

965
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:39,439
THAT DIDN'T WIN.

966
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,649
>> EXACTLY.

967
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,777
>> I HONESTLY BELIEVE TONY IS
GOING TO HELP MY GAME, AS LONG

968
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,780
AS OUR INTERESTS LINE UP,
THERE'S NO END TO THE DAMAGE WE

969
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:56,873
CAN DO TOGETHER.

970
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:03,297
CAN DO TOGETHER.

971
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:15,183
>> THEY CAN TIE UP THE ROOSTER,
BUT THE HEN CAN RUN FREE.

972
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,144
EVENTUALLY WE HAVE TO LET THEM
LOOSE.

973
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,980
THEY HAVE TO GET USED TO THIS
BEING HOME.

974
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:20,981
THEY'LL STAY TOGETHER.

975
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,817
>> TAI AND CHICKENS HAVE A
HISTORY THAT'S SKETCHY.

976
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,612
THERE'S JUST GOING TO COME A
POINT WHERE THOSE CHICKENS START

977
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,530
LOOKING LIKE ANGUS CATTLE, YOU
KNOW?

978
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,116
SO WE SHOULD NOT BE GETTING TOO
ATTACHED TO THEM.

979
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,203
>> NOW WE LIVE WITH THEM FOR A
WHILE AND WE CAN NAME THEM.

980
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:35,829
>> GLORIA.

981
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,205
>> THAT LOOKS LIKE A GLRA.

982
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:41,209
>> MONICA IS THE WHITE ONE.

983
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,086
>> SHE'S SO CUTE.

984
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,464
>> THE IT WILL SKINNY ONE, OKAY?

985
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:49,801
>> THE KITCHENS BECOME MY
RESPONSIBILITY, KEEP THEM ALIVE.

986
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,053
NOBODY ELSE WOULD.

987
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:51,928
I'M THE CHICKEN GUY.

988
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:57,351
IT'S A BURDEN BUT IT'S A
RESPONSIBILITY.

989
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:01,688
I DON'T MIND TAKING IT ON.

990
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,356
>> CORN.

991
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,482
YOU HAVE THE SHARE THE WEALTH.

992
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,233
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME DON'T GET
ALL THE CORN OFF THE COB.

993
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,904
>> DON'T.

994
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:12,699
>> WE GIVE THE CHICKENS MORE
FOOD THAN WE HAVE.

995
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,534
COME ON, TAI.

996
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,204
>> BOTH OF US LOVE ANIMAL, NO
DOUBT ABOUT IT.

997
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,666
I'M A COUNTRY BOY FROM ALABAMA.

998
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,877
I'M LOOKING OUT FOR ME AND
MYSELF, AND TAI IS LOOKING OUT

999
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,087
FOR THE CHICKENS.

1000
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,213
THERE'S A LOT OF CORN HERE NOW.

1001
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,216
I THINK THE CHICKENS INEVITABLY
WILL HURT TAI.

1002
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,718
>> WE GIVE YOU ENOUGH FOOD.

1003
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,928
GET OFF.

1004
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,347
>> IN THIS LEVEL OF COMPETITION,
ANYTHING CAN BE A REASON FOR

1005
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,765
SOMEONE TO GET RID OF YOU.

1006
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,726
>> I'M GOING TO HIDE THE RICE33
BEFORE HE GIVES THAT TO THEM.

1007
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,105
HE HAS TO DECIDE WHAT HE'S HERE
TO DO, WIN A MILLION DOLLARS OR

1008
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:47,275
MARRY THESE CHICKENS.

1009
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,090
>> I CAME INTO THIS GAME CALM
AND COLLECTED.

1010
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,299
NOW I HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY
BOTTLED UP INSIDE OF ME.

1011
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:15,762
IT BURNS ME UP JUST TO SIT DOWN
AND LET EVERYTHING BE QUIET,

1012
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,431
BECAUSE IN THIS GAME, ANYTHING
CAN HAPPEN.

1013
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,724
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE THEIR MINDS.

1014
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,850
PEOPLE COULD BE LYING TO YOU.

1015
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,977
SO I HAVE TO GET SOME KIND OF
INTEL.

1016
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,272
SO I NEED TO FINISH MY SPY
BUNKER AND GET CONTROL OF THIS

1017
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:29,901
GAME.

1018
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,319
YOU KNOW, I'M HERE FOR A REASON.

1019
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,487
I'M A GAME CHANGER.

1020
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,324
I'M GOING TO BE DOWN THERE
BUILDING MY BUNKER AND I'LL HAVE

1021
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:46,835
ALL NIGHT TO DO IT BECAUSE
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SLEEPING.

1022
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:51,506
SO I STARTED COVERING MYSELF UP
WITH DEBRIS TO SEE HOW IT WORKS.

1023
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,969
WHILE I'M DOING THAT, I SEE
SANDRA AND TROYZAN WALKING UP MY

1024
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:56,887
WAY.

1025
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:01,767
I HAD THE BAIL OUT OF IT AND I
HAD TO HIDE.

1026
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,937
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BETTER
TO GO?

1027
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:11,109
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1028
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,236
>> WHAT ABOUT TONY?

1029
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,155
>> YOU NEVER KNOW.

1030
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,324
>> I CREEP UP ON THEM, THEY'RE
TALKING.

1031
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,159
VERY INTENSE CONVERSATION.

1032
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:19,993
I'M HEARING MY NAME.

1033
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,620
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO STIR UP
THINGS.

1034
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,829
THEY'RE TRYING TO PLOT AGAINST
ME.

1035
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,706
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

1036
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,332
>> HUH?

1037
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:33,006
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

1038
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:33,840
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1039
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:39,679
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
THE PLATE.

1040
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:44,184
>> SANDRA GIVES ME THE BIGGEST
LIE.

1041
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,353
SO I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT
SANDRA IS AGAINST ME.

1042
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,898
>> I'M TELLING YOU THAT I'M NOT
STEALING AND SCAMMING.

1043
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,149
I KNOW I'M A THREAT.

1044
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,735
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO MAKE MY
TARGET BIGGER THAN IT ALREADY

1045
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,903
IS.

1046
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,030
I WANTED TO STAY WITH HER, BUT
THE MORE I SEE HER SNEAKING

1047
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,407
AROUND DOING THINGS, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO PUT A STOP TO THAT.

1048
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,244
>> FOR SOME REASON THERE'S
THINGS IN YOUR HEAD.

1049
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,872
>> RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOTHING IN
MY HEAD I'M JUST CURIOUS TO WHAT

1050
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,915
THE HELL IS GOING ON.

1051
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,001
>> I THOUGHT I HAD ALIGNED
MYSELF WITH TONY, BUT HE'S

1052
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,211
RUNNING AROUND ACTING CRAZY.

1053
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,840
HE WANTS THE LOOK ME IN THE EYE
LIKE THE FUZZ, LIKE THE POPO

1054
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,508
DOES, LIKE THEY'RE TAUGHT TO DO.

1055
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,052
I DON'T WANT TO EVER DEAL WITH
THAT AGAIN.

1056
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:22,430
THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT THIS
DUDE WOULD DO FOR $1 MILLION.

1057
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,557
TONY NEEDS TO GO HOME.

1058
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,290
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THE FIRST WEEK
OR TWO IS ALWAYS TOUGH.

1059
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,249
LIKE FIRST SEVEN DAYS FOR ME.

1060
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,710
>> DAMN RIGHT.

1061
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,211
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE STRONG.

1062
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,296
>> WE ARE.

1063
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,256
>> ME, TOO.

1064
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,174
>> I TRUST YOU 100%.

1065
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,427
>> I DO, TOO.

1066
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,887
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY.

1067
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,263
>> I DON'T EITHER.

1068
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:09,269
>> I KNOW OZZY IS COMING FOR ME,
AND I SEE THAT OZZY AND J.T.

1069
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,980
SEEM SUPER TIGHT, WHICH IS NOT
GOOD FOR ME.

1070
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:17,444
MY WHOLE LIFE RIGHT NOW IS
HANGING ON LIKE BY A STRING.

1071
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,612
IN THIS GAME.

1072
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:24,117
I THINK THEY THINK CIRIE THE
LEGEND JEDI MIND TRICK PUPPET

1073
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:24,576
MASTER IS TRYING TO GET ME.

1074
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,454
THAT MIGHT BE SO.

1075
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,290
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.

1076
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:35,003
SO I HAVE TO TRY TO WEED OUT WHO
I CAN PLAY WITH AND WHO I CAN'T.

1077
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,796
I HAVE TO GET IN WITH SOMEBODY.

1078
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,009
I CAN'T PLAY BY MYSELF.

1079
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:46,181
I DON'T TALK TO YOU A LOT
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT

1080
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:49,809
BLATANTLY OBVIOUS, BUT YOU KNOW
WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE SOLID.

1081
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,479
ONLY TIME I'M GOING TO WRITE
YOUR NAME IS IF I'M NOT HERE AND

1082
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,356
IT'S FOR YOUR BENEFIT.

1083
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:54,814
>> OKAY.

1084
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,316
SAME ON MY PART.

1085
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,526
>> I TOLD CIRIE I'M GOOD WITH
HER.

1086
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,321
BUT IF SOMEONE'S GOING TO THROW
HER NAME OUT, I'M GOING TO GO

1087
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,405
WITH IT.

1088
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:06,493
LAST TIME I PLAYED LIKE A COP,
LOOK WHERE IT GOT ME?

1089
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,495
THIS TIME I'M PLAYING LIKE A
CRIMINAL, AND WE'LL SEE WHERE IT

1090
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,496
GETS ME.

1091
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:14,167
MY WORD IS NOT MY BOND IN THIS
GAME THIS TIME.

1092
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:14,834
>> HOW YOU FEELING?

1093
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,836
>> I'M FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOU.

1094
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,505
>> I'M FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOU.

1095
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,839
>> 100%.

1096
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,342
>> YEAH.

1097
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,803
I'M LIKE, DON'T SCREW ME, PLEASE
DON'T SKEW ME.

1098
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,348
>> CIRIE, I'D NEVER SCREW YOU.

1099
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,849
CIRIE IS A MASTERFUL PLAYER.

1100
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:34,521
SHE HAS THIS MYSTICAL PLAYER
THAT DRAWS YOU IN.

1101
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,315
>> YOU'RE A SMART PERSON, ZEKE.

1102
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,985
I SEE YOU TALKING TO THESE GUYS,
AND I KNOW EVERYBODY HAS TO TALK

1103
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,237
TO EVERYBODY, IF I HEARD YOUR
NAME, I WOULD TELL YOU.

1104
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,697
>> WE'RE SOLID, DUDE.

1105
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:48,743
>> I WANTEDING TO MORE THAN TO
WORK WITH CIRIE, BUT AS GAGA AS

1106
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,205
I AM TO BE PLAYING WITH HER,
CIRIE IS ARGUABLY THE MOST

1107
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,874
DANGEROUS PLAYER HERE, SO MY GUT
TELLS ME IT'S TOO EARLY IN THE

1108
00:54:54,958 --> 00:55:00,422
GAME TO ALIGN WITH SOMEONE WHO
EVERYONE IS GUNNING FOR.

1109
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,842
>> I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU A
PIECE OF ADVICE LIKE A GIFT.

1110
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:04,926
>> OKAY.

1111
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,555
>> THE IMPRESSION IS THAT YOU'RE
TALKING TO EVERYBODY.

1112
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,389
>> AND EVERYBODY TALKS TO
EVERYBODY.

1113
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,099
>> OKAY.

1114
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,308
BUT THAT'S COOL.

1115
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,769
>> EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY TALKS
TO EVERYBODY, IF THEY LOOK AT

1116
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:18,189
YOU AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
TALKING MORE THAN EVERYBODY

1117
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,901
ELSE, THEN THEY'RE GOING TO SAY
YOU'RE SCRAMBLING.

1118
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,236
I DON'T THINK I AM.

1119
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:26,865
I DON'T FULLY TRUST CIRIE
BECAUSE SHE'S FEEDING ME WHAT

1120
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,950
SHE THINKS IS
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE.

1121
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,578
HEY, DEBBIE, I'M DOING YOU A
FAVOR, PAL.

1122
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,580
I'M COMING TO YOU, AND I'M
TELLING YOU THEY'RE TRYING TO

1123
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,581
GET YOU OUT.

1124
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,542
I ASSESSED IT, I DON'T BUY IT.

1125
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,545
I DON'T KNOW IF CIRIE
UNDERSTANDS WHAT KIND OF

1126
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,130
TRAINING I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

1127
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:46,301
I AM A CAPTAIN IN THE CIVIL AIR
PATROL, ALTHOUGH I DON'T GET

1128
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,177
PAID IN DOLLARS.

1129
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,721
I GET PAID IN MILITARY TRAINING.

1130
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:54,434
SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT TO
OUTWIT ME.

1131
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,102
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT.

1132
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,563
>> IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING
HAPPENS...

1133
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,482
>> OR WE LOSE YOU MEAN?

1134
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,610
>> WELL, THAT'S THE ONLY
SOMETHING THAT COULD HAPPEN.

1135
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,320
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1136
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,571
WE HAVE THE CLARIFY.

1137
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,324
>> IN THE EVENT WE HAVE TO TAKE
SOMEONE OUT, I THINK WE SHOULD

1138
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,617
GO FOR ONE OF THE GUYS.

1139
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:17,624
THE ONLY WAY THAT BIG BOLD MOVE
WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IS IF IT WAS

1140
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,166
COMPLETELY QUIET.

1141
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,627
>> I AGREE.

1142
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,044
WE'RE COOL, GIRL.

1143
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,629
>> ALL RIGHT.

1144
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:22,921
>> YEAH.

1145
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,130
OKAY.

1146
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,300
>> ALL YOU REALLY HAVE AT THE
END OF THE DAY AS FAR AS WHO TO

1147
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:32,680
TRUST IS YOUR INSTINCT, YOUR
INTERNAL RADAR, YOUR [BLEEPED]

1148
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:37,018
DETECTOR, AND MINE SAYS CIRIE
WOULD BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK

1149
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,686
IF WE LOST, AND SHE'S LOOKING
FOR AN OPENING.

1150
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,148
I ADMIRE IT, BUT MY B.S.

1151
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:55,203
DETECTOR WAS EH, EH, EH WITH
WHAT SHE WAS TELLING ME.

1152
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:55,954
>> YOU DOING LAUNDRY?

1153
00:56:56,037 --> 00:57:01,334
>> NO, I'M GOING TO WASH THE
POT.

1154
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:04,879
SO HAS TONY APPROACHED YOU TO
JOIN HIS ALLIANCE OF FIVE.

1155
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:08,675
>> TONY HASN'T TALKED TO ME THE
WHOLE TIME I'VE BEEN OUT HERE.

1156
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,635
ARE YOU IN HIS ALLIANCE OF FIVE?

1157
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,761
>> ACCORDING TO HIM I AM.

1158
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:15,598
BUT I NEED YOU TO KEEP THIS
BETWEEN ME AND YOU, BECAUSE

1159
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,809
WE'RE GOING TO TURN THE TABLES
ON HIM.

1160
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,479
I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE SAID, LIKE
HE'S THE BOSS, AND HE'S NOT THE

1161
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,063
BOSS.

1162
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:22,856
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1163
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,231
>> YEAH.

1164
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,191
>> I'M DONE.

1165
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,359
TONY CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

1166
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:30,697
I THINK HE FEELS LIKE HE CAN
THIS WHATEVER, BUT HE'S TOTALLY

1167
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,865
CONFUSED BECAUSE THIS IS MY
GAME.

1168
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:36,161
YOU KNOW THAT SAYING, YOU'RE
ONLY THE KING UNTIL THE QUEEN

1169
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:36,578
ARRIVES?

1170
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,829
I'M HERE.

1171
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,915
TONY TOLD ME THAT I'M A THREAT
AND AUBRY IS A THREAT AND IF WE

1172
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,377
CAN GET CALEB AND MALCOLM ON
BOARD US FIVE CAN TAKE OUT THE

1173
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,712
OTHER FOUR.

1174
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,256
I WAS BEEN TO PLAY THIS GAME.

1175
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,176
IT'S SO NATURAL TO ME THAT I
DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO PUT

1176
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,218
TOO MUCH EFFORT.

1177
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:58,057
HE WANTS TO GO FORWARD WITH FIVE
STRONG PEOPLE AND...

1178
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,767
>> I AIN'T ON THAT LIST?

1179
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,977
>> NO.

1180
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,729
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I'M STILL
HERE, STILL ON TOP, STILL THE

1181
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,479
QUEEN.

1182
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,191
TONY IS GOING HOME AND THAT'S
IT.

1183
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,902
>> SO HALI IS ON OUR SIDE.

1184
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,362
I THINK SANDRA IS EASILY ON OUR
SIDE.

1185
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,615
AND I HAVE A FANTASTIC FEELING
ABOUT JEFF VARNER.

1186
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,574
>> THAT'S FINE.

1187
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,658
>> OKAY.

1188
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:19,120
>> SANDRA PUT TOGETHER AN
ALLIANCE OF FIVE IN JUST 15

1189
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:19,662
MINUTES.

1190
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,081
I MEAN, THAT'S SCARY.

1191
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:22,957
SANDRA KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

1192
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,919
SHE'S WON THIS GAME TWICE FOR A
REASON.

1193
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,754
>> IT'S ON, MAMA.

1194
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:31,633
WHEN TWO WINNERS OF "SURVIVOR"
GO AFTER EACH OTHER FOR ANOTHER

1195
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:35,637
MILLION DOLLARS, IT GETS UGLY
FAST.

1196
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,429
AND I LOVE IT.

1197
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:36,846
I CAN'T WAIT THE SEE THE
FIREWORKS.

1198
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,448
>> HOW YOU DOING?

1199
00:58:55,531 --> 00:58:56,783
>> I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY'S TRYING
THE PLAY ME.

1200
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,825
THEY'RE PLANNING SOMETHING?

1201
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:58,743
>> ARE YOU WORKING WITH SANDRA?

1202
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,287
>> NO.

1203
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,665
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE TOLD ME, WE'RE
JUST TALKING ABOUT MICHAELA, HOW

1204
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,167
SHE MOVES THE CRATES CLOSE TO
THE FIRE.

1205
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,335
COME ON, SANDRA.

1206
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:11,005
I WANTED TO WORK WITH SANDRA,
BUT NOW I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S

1207
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:11,422
BREWING.

1208
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,173
I CAN FEEL IT.

1209
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:12,840
I CAN SEE IT.

1210
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,509
SHE'S SCHEMING AND SCAMMING.

1211
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,760
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PUT A
STOP TO THAT.

1212
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:20,139
WE HAVE TO GET STRONG, ME, YOU,
MALCOLM AND CALEB HAVE TO GET

1213
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,101
STRONG AND PULL SOMEONE ELSE IN,
BUT WE HAVE TO SOLIDIFY THAT.

1214
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:28,856
I DON'T MIND SNAKES, BUT
WEASELS, NOT TOO FOND OF THEM.

1215
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,526
IT'S TIME TO START GETTING
RUTHLESS.

1216
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,820
>> WE HAVEN'T TALKED TOO MUCH.

1217
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,698
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S
GOING TO START THINKING ABOUT A

1218
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,491
MAJORITY IN THIS TRIBE.

1219
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:39,951
SO WE NEED TO THINK, YOU KNOW.

1220
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:43,496
>> NO, I'M... MY THING IS
STRENGTH, STRENGTH, STRENGTH,

1221
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:44,539
STRENGTH, STRENGTH.

1222
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,833
>> 100%, BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING
TO START TROUBLE.

1223
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,378
I THINK IT'S SANDRA, SO WE GOT
TO KEEP THE STRONG TOGETHER.

1224
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:53,840
>> YOU CAN'T LET SANDRA MOBILIZE
HER FORCES AND HAVE THEM AT HER

1225
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,427
BECK AND CALL WHENEVER SHE WANTS
THEM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW SHE WON

1226
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,594
THE GAME TWICE.

1227
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:02,682
AS FAR AS ALLIES GO, TONY IS NOT
MY FIRST CHOICE, BUT HE'S

1228
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,976
SOMEBODY I THINK I CAN WORK
WITH, NOT BECAUSE I TRUST HIM, I

1229
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:10,398
DON'T TRUST HIM ANY FURTHER THAN
I CAN THROW HIS BIG, BALD BODY,

1230
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,818
BUT IT BENEFITS ME TO HAVE ALL
THE STRONG PLAYERS AS LONG AS

1231
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:14,402
POSSIBLE.

1232
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,905
I NEED CALM -- CAMOUFLAGE.

1233
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:18,740
>> I'M DOWN WITH THE DUDES.

1234
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,242
I WANT TO BE STRONG.

1235
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,203
SANDRA'S BEEN RUNNING AROUND
GRABBING DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

1236
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,414
SHE HAD TO GRAB ME.

1237
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,957
I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.

1238
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,209
>> SANDRA IS BAD NEWS.

1239
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:34,213
THEY GET RID OF ONE OF US STRONG
GUYS AND THE REINS GO IN THEIR

1240
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,381
HANDS AND THAT'S NO GOOD.

1241
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,551
>> WITH SANDRA AND TONY, YOU
CAN'T TRUST EITHER ONE, BUT

1242
01:00:38,634 --> 01:00:41,554
RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE I CAN
TRUST TONY MORE THAN SANDRA.

1243
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:44,557
BECAUSE HE'S GOT A BIG TARGET ON
HIS BACK, AND I FEEL THE SAME

1244
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,475
WAY.

1245
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,895
SO WE GOT TO TRY TO KEEP EACH
OTHER SAFE.

1246
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,899
SOMEBODY OFFICIALLY KICKED THE
HORNET'S NEST.

1247
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:57,904
>> IF SANDRA CAN PERSUADE
EVERYBODY TO SEND OUT ONE OF THE

1248
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,906
STRONGEST PLAYERS, THAT'S
IDIOTIC.

1249
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:00,865
SHE'S WON THE GAME TWICE.

1250
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,034
I TOTALLY GET HOW SHE DOES IT.

1251
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,744
SHE'S GOT EVERYBODY IN HER
POCKET IMMEDIATELY.

1252
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,789
>> I KNOW HE'S A THREAT, BUT IF
TONY GOES HOME, WE'LL GET NICKED

1253
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,791
OFF ONE BY ONE.

1254
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,042
THAT'S HOW I FEEL IT'S GOING.

1255
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:11,793
>> GAME OVER.

1256
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,920
>> PLAYING WITH TONY IS
DANGEROUS.

1257
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,923
BUT CHALLENGES, WE GOT TO KEEP
THE TRIBE STRONG.

1258
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:27,767
IT MIGHT BE A BLOODBATH LATER,
BUT FOR NOW WE GOT TO WIN.

1259
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:32,897
IT MIGHT BE A BLOODBATH LATER,
BUT FOR NOW WE GOT TO WIN.

1260
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:46,536
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1261
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:51,499
>> Jeff: NUKU GETTING YOUR
FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW MANA

1262
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,458
TRIBE.

1263
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,835
CIERA VOTED OUT AT THE FIRST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1264
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,294
>> KNEW IT.

1265
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,379
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1266
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,797
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

1267
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,798
>> YEAH.

1268
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,843
>> FIRST THINGS FIRST, TAKE BACK
THE IDOL, ZEKE.

1269
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:05,638
THANK YOU.

1270
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:08,307
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

1271
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,976
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, SIX
MEMBERS OF EACH TRIBE ARE GOING

1272
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:14,814
THE RACE OUT INTO THE OCEAN,
ACROSS A BALANCE BEAM, TO A

1273
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:16,149
CAGE.

1274
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,110
YOU'LL CRAWL UP AND OVER THE
CAGE, WHERE YOU WILL THEN UNTIE

1275
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:23,281
A VERY LONG AND VERY HEAVY
SNAKE.

1276
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:27,034
YOU'LL PUSH IT BACK UP OVER THE
CAGE, BRING IT BACK THE SHORE,

1277
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,829
PUT THE SNAKE IN ITS CRADLE
WHERE THE THREE REMAINING TRIBE

1278
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,999
MEMBERS WILL THEN UNTIE NUMBERED
TILES.

1279
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,710
YOU'LL USE THOSE TILES TO SOLVE
A COMBINATION LOCK.

1280
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,754
THAT WILL RELEASE A SERIES OF
RINGS.

1281
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,549
YOU'LL THEN ATTEMPT TO LAND
THOSE RINGS ON TARGET.

1282
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:46,846
THE FIRST TRIBE TO SPELL
"IMMUNITY" WINS IMMUNITY.

1283
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:50,224
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SECOND

1284
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,851
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

1285
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,519
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.

1286
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,896
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

1287
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:55,980
>> YES.

1288
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,106
>> YES.

1289
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:57,648
>> YES.

1290
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,358
>> Jeff: FISHING KIT.

1291
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,568
>> OH, WOW.

1292
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,819
>> WOW.

1293
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:08,493
>> Jeff: EVERYTHING YOU NEED,
TRAPS, NETS, HAND REELS, PLUS A

1294
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,994
RAFT WITH PADDLES WAITING FOR
YOU BACK AT CAMP.

1295
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,330
>> WOW.

1296
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,415
>> Jeff: NUKU, YOU HAVE ONE
EXTRA MEMBER.

1297
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:14,957
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT SOMEBODY
OUT.

1298
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:19,253
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?

1299
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,087
>> CIRIE.

1300
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:23,216
>> CIRIE GOING TO SIT THIS ONE
OUT.

1301
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,551
EVERYBODY ELSE TAKE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE.

1302
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:33,893
CIRIE, YOU CAN TAKE A SPOT ON
THE BENCH.

1303
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:34,727
ALL RIGHT.

1304
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:38,064
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY AND
REWARD.

1305
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,023
SURVIVORS READY?

1306
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,025
GO!

1307
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,736
UP AND OVER THAT BALANCE BEAM
FIRST.

1308
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:45,321
ALL THE WAY TO THE CAGE.

1309
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:55,456
YOU CAN'T GO OVER THE CAGE UNTIL
EVERYBODY IS THERE.

1310
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,208
>> WHOA, NUKU, YEAH.

1311
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,919
>> Jeff: WE'RE NECK AND NECK
RIGHT NOW.

1312
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,087
BOTH TRIBES VERY EVEN.

1313
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:05,424
YOU CAN'T MOVE UNTIL YOUR
SLOWEST SWIMMER GETS THERE, GO,

1314
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,469
NUKU, GO, MANA.

1315
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:16,143
NOW EVERYBODY HAS TO GO UP AND
OVER.

1316
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:24,610
THE NEXT STEP IS START UNTYING
THAT SNAKE.

1317
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,945
>> TONY, RIGHT UNDERNEATH YOU,
BY THE NECK.

1318
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,614
>> GET IT RIGHT, THERE RIGHT
THERE.

1319
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,158
>> Jeff: VARNER BARKING OUT
ORDERERS FROM THE SAFETY OF THE

1320
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:31,701
CAGE.

1321
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,578
>> RIGHT AT YOUR HAND.

1322
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,787
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO UNDER.

1323
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,790
>> Jeff: THE MORE PEOPLE UNDER
WATER, FASTER YOU WILL RELEASE

1324
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:38,624
THAT SNAKE.

1325
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,127
NUKU SENDING A LOT OF PEOPLE AT
ONCE.

1326
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,462
MANA NOT.

1327
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:47,258
NUKU ALREADY HAS THAT SNAKE
RELEASED.

1328
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:48,134
MANA IS STRUGGLING TO GET IT
UNTIED.

1329
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,011
>> COME ON, GUYS.

1330
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:53,931
>> Jeff: CALEB NOW GOING BACK
IN.

1331
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,475
NUKU NOW STARTING TO LIFT THAT
SNAKE.

1332
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,977
YOU CAN SEE THE EFFORT IT TAKES.

1333
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,771
THIS IS NO JOKE.

1334
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,647
>> OH, MY GOD.

1335
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,318
>> Jeff: THAT SNAKE WEIGHS
OVER 400 POUNDS.

1336
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:10,323
IT WILL TAKE EVERYBODY.

1337
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:13,034
>> ONE, TWO, THREE!

1338
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,370
>> Jeff: TAI, ZEKE, SARAH ALL
WORKING TOGETHER FOR NUKU.

1339
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,538
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1340
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,040
>> AWESOME JOB!

1341
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,875
>> YEAH!

1342
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:25,338
>> Jeff: NUKU MAKING A LOT OF
PROGRESS NOW.

1343
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:29,175
MANA STILL TRYING TO UNTIE.

1344
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,177
>> ONE, TWO, THREE.

1345
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:31,927
>> WE GOT IT.

1346
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,305
>> Jeff: NUKU HAS THE SNAKE
FREE.

1347
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:35,389
EVERYBODY OVER.

1348
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,974
>> GO, GUYS, GO!

1349
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,977
>> WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT, WE GOT
IT.

1350
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,687
>> Jeff: MANA FINALLY HAVE IT
FREE.

1351
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,396
CAN THEY CATCH UP.

1352
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,564
>> WE'RE STILL IN IT.

1353
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:46,651
>> Jeff: THEY STILL HAVE A LOT
OF CHALLENGE LEFT.

1354
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,027
THIS GIVES NUKU A BIG ADVANTAGE.

1355
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:53,240
THEY CAN DRAG THE SNAKE, WHICH
IS MUCH EASIER THAN CARRYING IT.

1356
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,034
>> I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH,
DUDE.

1357
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:59,705
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO GO UP AND
OVER?

1358
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,166
VARNER HAS BEEN USELESS SO FAR
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

1359
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,042
>> PUT CALEB ON THE WALL.

1360
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:07,088
>> Jeff: SOMEBODY GIVE ME THAT
HANDLE.

1361
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:12,385
CALEB WORKING WITH TONY.

1362
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,261
THEY HAVE THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE.

1363
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,721
NUKU CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY.

1364
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,183
IT WILL TAKE A GIGANTIC COMEBACK
FROM MANA, BUT ANYTHING CAN

1365
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:24,063
HAPPEN IN "SURVIVOR."

1366
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:27,233
NUKU IS NOW OVER THE BEACH AND
IN THE WATER.

1367
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,735
NUKU HEADING UP THE BEACH.

1368
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,862
MANA NEARLY HAS THEIR SNAKE
CLEAR.

1369
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:32,613
YOU'RE GOOD.

1370
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:36,534
GET OVER.

1371
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:37,743
>> GREAT WORK, GUYS.

1372
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:38,661
GREAT WORK.

1373
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,747
>> Jeff: THEY'RE NOW IN THE
SECOND STAGE.

1374
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,291
J.T., SIERRA AND DEBBIE UNTYING
THE NUMBERED TILES.

1375
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,920
MANA WILL HAVE TO HUSTLE TO GET
BACK IN THIS.

1376
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:49,255
>> GO, GO, GO GO, GO, GO, GO,.

1377
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,091
>> Jeff: NUKU HAS ALL SIX
TILES.

1378
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,384
>> DEBBIE, STAY COOL.

1379
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:56,345
>> Jeff: IT'S GOING TO BE
DEBBIE WORKING ON THE

1380
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:56,762
COMBINATION LOCK.

1381
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,265
HERE COMES MANA.

1382
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,099
BIG DISASTER.

1383
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,102
MANA LOSES THEIR SNAKE IN THE
WATER.

1384
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:03,811
WOW.

1385
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,438
>> LET'S GO, GUYS.

1386
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,733
>> Jeff: THAT IS A GIGANTIC
SETBACK.

1387
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,443
DEBBIE HAS ALL THREE PAIRS OF
NUMBERS.

1388
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,612
SHE CAN START WORKING ON THE
COMBINATION LOCK NOW.

1389
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,157
MANA HAS TO HOIST THAT SNAKE
BACK UP.

1390
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,617
AND THEY'RE BACK AT IT AGAIN.

1391
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,245
HALI GOES IN.

1392
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,413
TROYZAN GOES IN.

1393
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:26,667
THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A DISASTER
IN A "SURVIVOR" CHALLENGE.

1394
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,961
DEBBIE RELEASES THE COMBINATION
LOCK.

1395
01:07:29,044 --> 01:07:29,503
START TOSSING RINGS.

1396
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,673
>> YOU GOT THIS.

1397
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,258
>> YOU GOT IT, GIRL.

1398
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:38,262
>> Jeff: SIERRA LANDS THE
FIRST LETTER FOR NUKU.

1399
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,890
>> Jeff: WE'RE ALMOST THERE,
GUYS.

1400
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:41,474
>> COME ON, GUYS.

1401
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,434
>> Jeff: TROYZAN FALLS.

1402
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:45,936
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK NOW.

1403
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:46,479
ANOTHER SLOWDOWN FOR MANA.

1404
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,981
>> THERE IT IS, BABY.

1405
01:07:49,064 --> 01:07:52,526
>> Jeff: J.T. SCORES THE
SECOND LETTER.

1406
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,653
J.T. SNAGS A THIRD LETTER.

1407
01:07:54,737 --> 01:08:00,326
LET'S GO, TROYZAN.

1408
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,494
SIERRA SNAGS A FOURTH.

1409
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,496
NUKU EXTENDING THEIR LEAD.

1410
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,872
HERE COMES MANA.

1411
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:05,998
CAN THEY CATCH UP?

1412
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:06,832
>> COME ON, GUYS.

1413
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,876
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO WORK.

1414
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,003
DROP IT AND GET OUT OF THERE.

1415
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:12,213
MANA FINALLY BACK.

1416
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:15,174
IT IS NOW SANDRA, MICHAELA AND
MALCOLM, AND THEY'RE GOING TO

1417
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,135
HAVE TO WORK VERY FAST.

1418
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,387
SIERRA AND J.T. HAVE DONE A NICE
JOB WITH THESE RINGS.

1419
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:23,849
THEY'RE HALF-WAY THERE, BUT THEY
ARE NOT ALL THE WAY THERE, WHICH

1420
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:28,562
MEANS THAT DOOR IS STILL OPEN
FOR MANA.

1421
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:29,855
MALCOLM HAS ALL SIX.

1422
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,149
MOVE OVER TO THE COMBINATION
LOCK.

1423
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,692
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THREE PAIRS
OF NUMBERS.

1424
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,903
THIS CHALLENGE IS STILL ALIVE.

1425
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:39,532
WHICH IS AMAZING GIVEN THE LEAD
NUKU HAD.

1426
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,992
SIERRA SNAGS THE FIFTH LETTER
FOR NUKU.

1427
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,703
THEY ARE THREE AWAY.

1428
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,663
MALCOLM, HE'S GOT IT.

1429
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:50,709
MALCOLM NOW GOING TO DO THE
TOSSING, AS WELL.

1430
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,879
MALCOLM HAS THE FIRST LETTER.

1431
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:58,509
J.T. HAS THE SIXTH LETTER.

1432
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,594
MALCOLM SCORES THE SECOND
LETTER.

1433
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,973
SUDDENLY MANA IS GETTING BACK IN
THIS.

1434
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,599
MALCOLM SNAGS THE THIRD LETTER.

1435
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:08,269
IT IS NOW 6-3.

1436
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:13,190
MALCOLM IS SLOWING CLOSING THAT
GAP.

1437
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,401
MALCOLM SNAGS THE FOURTH LETTER
FOR MANA.

1438
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,069
>> COME ON, J.T.

1439
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:18,445
>> Jeff: NOW IT IS J.T.

1440
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,282
FEELING THE PRESSURE.

1441
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:26,537
MALCOLM CLOSES WHAT SEEMED TO BE
AN INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD.

1442
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,247
MALCOLM SNAGS THE FIFTH FOR
MANA.

1443
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,791
IT IS 6-5.

1444
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:36,255
>> YOU CAN DO THIS, MALCOLM,
COME ON, WASDY.

1445
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,423
>> Jeff: MALCOLM FOR THE
SIXTH.

1446
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,800
IT IS TIED NOW 6-6.

1447
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,761
NOW IT'S ON.

1448
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,096
MALCOLM WITH THE SEVENTH.

1449
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:44,597
JUST MISSING.

1450
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,265
>> YOU GOT IT, J.T.

1451
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,224
RELAX.

1452
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,935
>> Jeff: NUKU THOUGHT THEY HAD
IT IN THE BAG.

1453
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:50,477
NOW WORRIED.

1454
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,271
>> COME ON, MALL COMING.

1455
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,189
>> SLOW AND STEADY.

1456
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:58,277
>> Jeff: MALCOLM ON AND OFF
AGAIN.

1457
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,238
J.T. SNAGS THE SEVENTH FOR NUKU.

1458
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:04,658
NUKU NOW ONE AWAY FROM WINNING
THIS CHALLENGE.

1459
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:08,579
>> YOU NEED A BREAK OR YOU GOOD?

1460
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:11,457
>> MICHAELA BITING HER LIP,
WANTING IN SO BAD.

1461
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,126
THIS TOSS COULD DO IT RIGHT
HERE.

1462
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,129
>> BREATH, BABY, BREATHE.

1463
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:19,465
>> Jeff: AND HE DOES IT.

1464
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:31,518
NUKU PULLS IT OUT, WINS THEIR
SECOND CHALLENGE IN A ROW.

1465
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:32,102
WOW.

1466
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,104
THAT WAS EPIC.

1467
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,481
>> YOU DID AWESOME.

1468
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,607
WE WERE WAY BEHIND.

1469
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:42,863
YOU CAUGHT UP WITH THEM.

1470
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,657
>> Jeff: NUKU, CONGRATULATIONS
AGAIN.

1471
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,951
ONCE AGAIN NOBODY GOING HOME
FROM YOUR TRIBE.

1472
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:52,289
YOU CAN GRAB THIS PART OF YOUR
REWARD.

1473
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,375
YOUR RAFT WILL BE WAITING FOR
YOU BACK AT CAMP.

1474
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:58,337
MANA, FOR THE SECOND TIME IF A
RE, I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT

1475
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,004
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1476
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,172
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1477
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:03,509
>> I CAN'T LOSE EVERY DAMN
CHALLENGE AND EXPECT TO WIN GAME

1478
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:04,760
CHANGERS.

1479
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:07,805
SO WE NEED TO KEEP THE STRONG
PEOPLE GOOD AT CHALLENGES AROUND

1480
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:08,889
FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE OR ELSE
WE'RE DOOMED.

1481
01:11:31,286 --> 01:11:35,040
>> ALL I CAN SAY IS JEFF DIDN'T
EMPHASIZE HOW HEAVY THAT SNAKE

1482
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,166
WAS.

1483
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,628
I MEAN, THAT THING ALTOGETHER
WAS PROBABLY LIKE 600, 700

1484
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:40,170
POUNDS.

1485
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,088
THAT THING WAS HEAVY.

1486
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:43,340
>> WE JUST FELL A LITTLE BIT
SHORT.

1487
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,550
>> I DON'T LIKE TO LOSE.

1488
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,718
>> NO.

1489
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:46,844
NONE OF US DO.

1490
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:51,223
>> THE CHALLENGE TODAY WAS
DEPLORABLE.

1491
01:11:51,306 --> 01:11:55,352
IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I
AM A STRONG PLAYER.

1492
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:59,064
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THAT I'M
HERE.

1493
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,234
SO TO BE STANDING THERE DOING
NOTHING WHILE WEAKER PLAYERS

1494
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:04,278
LOSE IT AGAIN.

1495
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:05,529
IT PISSED ME OFF.

1496
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,407
BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE MAKING
DECISIONS FOR THE GROUP, SO I

1497
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:18,500
GUESS I GOT TO SIT HERE AND DEAL
WITH IT.

1498
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:30,721
GUESS I GOT TO SIT HERE AND DEAL
WITH IT.

1499
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,639
>> TONY'S GOT TO GO.

1500
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,892
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE HAPPY
ONCE TONY IS GONE.

1501
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:36,268
>> BUT HE NEVER STOPS.

1502
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:40,105
>> I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LET
HIM GO OFF BY HIMSELF.

1503
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,440
BECAUSE HE CAN FIND AN IDOL.

1504
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,276
>> IS MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GO
STRAIGHT UP AND VOTE TONY.

1505
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:50,657
IF HE STARTS RUNNING AROUND
LOOKING FOR THAT IDOL, WE HAVE

1506
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:51,950
TO SPLIT VOTES.

1507
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:55,079
>> AT THIS POINT I'M ALMOST SURE
I HAVE THE NUMBERS THE VOTE OUT

1508
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,288
TONY.

1509
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:58,373
HE'S RUNNING AROUND ACTING LIKE
HE'S THE KING, SO HE'S GOT TO

1510
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,125
GO.

1511
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:03,378
UNFORTUNATELY TONY IS GOOD AT
FINDING IDOLS, AND THAT MAKES

1512
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,463
HIM DANGEROUS.

1513
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,965
SO WE GOT TO SPLIT THE VOTE.

1514
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,509
WE NEED TO GRAB TWO MORE.

1515
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,135
>> CALEB AND MALCOLM?

1516
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,428
>> YEAH.

1517
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:19,269
>> RIGHT.

1518
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:23,315
>> TONY IS SUCH A TARGET IN THIS
GAME, AND WE HAVE A WIDE-OPEN

1519
01:13:23,398 --> 01:13:28,112
DOOR RIGHT NOW IF WE WANTED TO
GO.

1520
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:31,490
WHAT IF HE KEEPS RACKING UP THE
IDOLS?

1521
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,157
WE HAVE A OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW.

1522
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,785
>> TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW?

1523
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,829
AND TONY AND AUBRY ARE THICK AS
THIEVES.

1524
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,831
>> THEY RUSSIA THEY'RE ALWAYS
GOING OFF TOGETHER.

1525
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,999
>> SO LET'S SPLIT VOTES.

1526
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,168
>> WHOSE NAME ARE YOU PUTTING
DOWN?

1527
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,003
>> I THINK IT SHOULD BE AUBRY.

1528
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,298
>> SANDRA IS SAYING THEY'RE
GOING TO PUT AUBRY'S NAME DOWN.

1529
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:51,677
TO BE HONEST, I'LL DO WHAT I
HAVE TO DO TO NOT GET VOTED OUT,

1530
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,348
BUT IF AUBRY GOES HOME, SANDRA
TAKES CONTROL OF THE GAME.

1531
01:13:56,431 --> 01:14:00,144
MY BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL.

1532
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:00,936
I'M HERE TO WIN.

1533
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,147
TO DO THAT I HAVE TO MAKE BIG
MOVES.

1534
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:06,859
SO IF SANDRA IS GOING HOME, I
WANT THE THRONE.

1535
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:11,405
WHEN I SET MY SIGHTS ON A
TARGET, I'M A HEAT-SEEKING

1536
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:20,539
MISSILE.

1537
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:27,462
THE QUEEN, SHE'S DANGEROUS, BRO.

1538
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,714
>> SHE'S A TWO-TIME WINNER.

1539
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,259
>> EVERYBODY SAYS, NEXT WEEK,
NEXT WEEK, DOESN'T HAPPEN.

1540
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:34,219
>> THAT'S SOMEHOW SHE WINS.

1541
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,263
SHE'S LIKE A HYENA.

1542
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:37,097
>> I AGREE.

1543
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,057
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU'RE
SAYING.

1544
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,767
>> TONY WAS RIGHT.

1545
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,645
SANDRA'S CONVINCED EVERYBODY
THAT TONY SHOULD GO.

1546
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,731
AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO GET ME
TO BE PART OF IT.

1547
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,734
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT,
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO STRONG

1548
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:54,364
PEOPLE, WHEN YOU GET RID OF ONE,
IT EXPOSES THE OTHER, YOU SEND

1549
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:57,117
TONY HOME, IT'S EXPOSING ME AND
MALCOLM.

1550
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,786
BUT LOOKING AT NUMBERS ON WHO
WILL VOTE OUT SANDRA, WE ONLY

1551
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:00,412
HAVE FOUR.

1552
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:05,792
SO WE NEED ONE MORE PERSON.

1553
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,711
>> MICHAELA WOULD GO WITH US
PROBABLY.

1554
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,797
>> THEY WON'T SEE IT COMING.

1555
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,506
SHE'S OUT.

1556
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:16,762
>> WE GOT TO TRY TO DO IT, MAN.

1557
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:21,850
>> SO TONY THROWS OUT LET'S TRY
TO FLIP MICHAELA AND IT MIGHT

1558
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,810
JUST WORK, ONE THING ABOUT
MICHAELA, SHE JUST HATES TO

1559
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,772
LOSE, SO MAYBE SHE'LL BE DOWN
WITH GETTING RID OF THE WEAKEST

1560
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:27,147
LINK.

1561
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,483
>> BANG, DONE.

1562
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,109
GONE, SEE YOU.

1563
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,778
>> I NEED YOU.

1564
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:42,120
LET'S PLAY, LET'S DO THIS, MAN.

1565
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,832
>> THE ONLY THING I'LL SAY IS
AFTER A CHALLENGE LIKE THAT, I

1566
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,627
THINK SENDING A STRONG PERSON
HOME RIGHT NOW IS STUPID.

1567
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:53,131
>> I KNOW EVERYONE'S GUNNING FOR
TONY, BUT I WANT THE GET FURTHER

1568
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,715
IN THE GAME.

1569
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:54,758
I WANT TO WIN CHALLENGES.

1570
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:55,968
>> ME TOO.

1571
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:59,972
>> TONY IS DANGEROUS, YEAH, HE
SHOULD GO, DO I THINK HE SHOULD

1572
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:00,806
GO RIGHT NOW, HE'S STRONG.

1573
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,766
>> I WANT TO WIN.

1574
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:05,143
I WANT THIS TRIBE SUPER STRONG,
RIGHT?

1575
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,812
IF WE LOSE ANOTHER CHALLENGE,
WE'RE SCREWED.

1576
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:12,317
PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME KNOW THAT
LOSE IS NOT IN MY EVERYDAY

1577
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,485
VERNACULAR.

1578
01:16:13,568 --> 01:16:14,695
SO TO COME OUT HERE AND DO IT
TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN IT

1579
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:18,198
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN, IT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1580
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:20,117
I DON'T LIKE LOSING.

1581
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,451
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

1582
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:25,956
>> I LOVE SANDRA, BUT BOTH
CHALLENGES SHE'S THE WEAKEST

1583
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:28,292
WOMAN HERE, THE SLOWEST WOMAN
HERE.

1584
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:32,337
>> I KNOW THAT TONY IS A THREAT,
BUT HE CAN HELP US WIN

1585
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,338
CHALLENGES.

1586
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,340
BUT SANDRA IS USELESS IN JUST
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

1587
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,342
>> I GET THE WHOLE ARGUMENT.

1588
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,135
THAT WAS HELL.

1589
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,344
I JUST WENT THROUGH HELL.

1590
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,680
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN
WITHOUT TONY.

1591
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:45,517
I'M IN HEAVEN, HAVING TWO
WINNERS GOING AT EACH OTHER IS

1592
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,768
CHRISTMAS.

1593
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,354
AND THE BEST PART OF IT IS WE
GET TO DECIDE WHICH ONE IS GOING

1594
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,188
HOME.

1595
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,858
>> YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE.

1596
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,526
YOU DON'T EVER PLAY WITH IT.

1597
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:57,029
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW YOU CAN GET
BURNED, YOU KNOW.

1598
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,113
>> YOU HAPPY?

1599
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:04,703
>> THE ONLY REASON THAT I'M
HESITANT IS THAT THE GUYS.

1600
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:05,871
I DON'T KNOW.

1601
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,999
TONY HAS ALREADY BEEN EATING
AWAY AT CALEB'S BRAIN.

1602
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:10,208
THAT'S WHY HE'S GOT TO GO.

1603
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:14,713
THERE IS A CHANCE IT COULD GO
SOUTH AND THEN I END UP GOING

1604
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:18,550
HOME, BUT LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, JUST BECAUSE TONY WON

1605
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,968
ONE DOESN'T MAKE HIM A KING.

1606
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,846
NO ONE HAS A TRACK RECORD LIKE
ME.

1607
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:24,848
AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT INTO
PERSPECTIVE TONIGHT WHEN TONY

1608
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:25,932
GOES HOME.

1609
01:17:56,004 --> 01:18:00,384
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TONY, IS
BACK-TO-BACK LOSSES, NOT HOW YOU

1610
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:01,760
WANT TO START A SEASON OF
"SURVIVOR."

1611
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:04,304
>> JEFF, WE WENT INTO THE
CHALLENGE FEELING STRONG.

1612
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:05,222
WE DIDN'T GIVE UP.

1613
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:06,306
WE DIDN'T SLOW DOWN.

1614
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,892
WE WERE ALL FIGHTING AND WE'RE
ANGRY THAT WE LOST THAT

1615
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:10,769
CHALLENGE, SO COMING HERE
TONIGHT, WE NEED THE STAY

1616
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:11,937
STRONG.

1617
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,064
WE NEED STRENGTH IN THE GAME.

1618
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:17,943
WE GO BACK TO THE NEXT CHALLENGE
AND WE KICK SOME ASS.

1619
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:21,905
>> Jeff: SO MALCOLM, GIVEN
THAT YOU'RE 0-2, SHOULD THE

1620
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:24,074
PHYSICALLY STRONG PEOPLE FEEL
SAFER?

1621
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:27,244
>> HAVE TO KEEP THE TRIBE
STRONG.

1622
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,954
THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS TO
WHAT MAKES A STRONG COMPETITOR

1623
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:33,250
IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN A
CHALLENGE, BUT IF WE DON'T KEEP

1624
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,793
PHYSICALLY STRONG PEOPLE, WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS MOVING

1625
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,421
FORWARD FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

1626
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,756
>> Jeff: MICHAELA, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING DURING THE

1627
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,093
CHALLENGE WHEN MALCOLM THREW
RING AFTER RING AFTER RING WHILE

1628
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:44,261
YOU DID NOTHING?

1629
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:46,012
>> I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THIS,
I'M PHYSICALLY IN THIS GAME

1630
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,973
BECAUSE I'M A STRONG PHYSICAL
PLAYER.

1631
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:51,977
I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO
BE HERE AND WE'RE ALL PUT HERE

1632
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:56,648
FOR A REASON, BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO SEND STRONG

1633
01:18:56,731 --> 01:19:00,652
PHYSICAL PLAYERS HOME RIGHT NOW.

1634
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:02,487
>> NOW I'M GETTING SCARED.

1635
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,656
>> Jeff: SANDRA, WHAT DO YOU
MEAN WE THAT?

1636
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:07,742
>> IF THEY'RE SAYING A WEAK
PLAYER SHOULD GO, MAYBE I SHOULD

1637
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,036
BE AFRAID, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
IF YOU LOOK BACK, THEY'VE PUT

1638
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,665
THE STRONGEST PLAYERS IN THE
RIGHT POSITIONS AND WE'VE STILL

1639
01:19:13,748 --> 01:19:14,875
COME OUT BEHIND.

1640
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,836
SO WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN TO
BE PHYSICAL RIGHT NOW IN THIS

1641
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,005
TRIBE?

1642
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,548
>> Jeff: TROYZAN, IT'S TRICKY.

1643
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:22,674
>> YEAH.

1644
01:19:22,757 --> 01:19:24,968
>> Jeff: SO IF YOU SURVIVE
TONIGHT'S VOTE AND IT GOES THE

1645
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:27,679
WAY YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO GO,
HOW WILL THIS TRIBE BE

1646
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:28,597
DIFFERENT?

1647
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:33,018
>> WE WILL BE AT LEAST 50% LESS
PARANOID.

1648
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,855
THERE'S JUST CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT
MAKE PEOPLE ON EDGE, LIKE DO I

1649
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:39,983
HAVE TO WAKE UP AT 4:00 A.M. AND
MAKE SURE SOMEONE'S NOT RUNNING

1650
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:42,027
OFF DOING SOMETHING CRAZY?

1651
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:42,944
THAT'S NUTTY.

1652
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,654
>> Jeff: TONY, YOU WERE
SHAKING YOUR HEAD.

1653
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:48,158
>> BECAUSE I CAUGHT HIM TALKING
TO SANDRA AT 4:00 A.M., SO I

1654
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:51,203
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANT BEING
UNEASY.

1655
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:52,037
>> I'M IN THE SNEAKING OFF
ANYWHERE.

1656
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,040
>> I CAUGHT YOU SNEAKING OFF.

1657
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:57,876
>> IT WAS A TWO-SECOND
CONVERSATION, I TURN AROUND, AND

1658
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,045
THERE'S TONY, WHAT ARE YOU ALL
TALKING ABOUT.

1659
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:04,382
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CRATES
IN THE FIRE, THAT WAS IT, BUT TO

1660
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,050
TONY, EVERYTHING IS PARANOIA.

1661
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,051
I DON'T PLAY LIKE THAT.

1662
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,094
I'M CALM.

1663
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:08,887
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION.

1664
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:13,391
IS SOMETHING IN MY DAMN HAIR.

1665
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:13,892
DON'T PLAY WITH ME.

1666
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,061
OH, THAT'S HUGE.

1667
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,104
[SCREAMING]
IT'S OKAY.

1668
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:18,396
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1669
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:24,444
RELAX.

1670
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:25,737
GEEZ LOUISE.

1671
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:29,282
>> Jeff: SO TONY, GOING BACK
TO SANDRA'S POINT, IN YOUR

1672
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:32,077
SEASON, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU
DROVE A LOT OF THE ACTION, A LOT

1673
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,455
OF THE DECISIONS, DO PEOPLE LOOK
AT YOU NOW EXPECTING YOU TO BE

1674
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:36,623
THAT GUY?

1675
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:39,125
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE
LEADING PART PROCEEDING ME, BUT

1676
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:44,130
I KNOW ABOUT THE LYING PART AND
THE DISLOYALTY AND THE

1677
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:46,258
DISHONESTY AND THE BETRAYALS,
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BELIEVE

1678
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:49,052
THAT BECAUSE THEY NOVI A HISTORY
OF LYING, BUT THAT'S NOT THE

1679
01:20:49,135 --> 01:20:50,220
GAME I'M PLAYING.

1680
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:53,974
WE ALL GET CAUGHT SNEAKING
AROUND, BUT I CAN TELL EVERYBODY

1681
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:56,101
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE NOT BEEN
SCAMMING NOBODY.

1682
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:59,396
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, I BELIEVE
HIM.

1683
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:00,730
>> THANK YOU.

1684
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:01,773
THANK YOU, GUYS.

1685
01:21:01,856 --> 01:21:04,234
>> Jeff: SO VARNER, YOU'RE
SAYING YOU BELIEVE TONY.

1686
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:05,068
>> I DO.

1687
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:08,738
>> Jeff: AND CALEB, YOU
BEREAVE TONY?

1688
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:09,656
>> YEAH.

1689
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:11,741
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, YOU ARE
NODDING YOUR HEAD.

1690
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,785
>> I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD LIKE
TONY.

1691
01:21:13,868 --> 01:21:14,494
I LOVE TONY.

1692
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:16,413
>> IT'S PERCEPTION.

1693
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:20,458
>> I'VE SEEN A TONY THAT'S
DIFFERENT THAN THE TONY FROM

1694
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,585
CAGAYAN.

1695
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,503
>> I'M NOT COMING OUTS HERE
COCKY OR CONFIDENT BECAUSE

1696
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,005
THEY'RE A DIFFERENT CALIBER OF
PLAYER.

1697
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:28,258
>> Jeff: SO VARNER, WHAT IS
YOUR PLAY RIGHT NOW AS WE GET

1698
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,301
READY TO VOTE?

1699
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:35,265
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THIS MANY
GAME-CHANGING PLAYERS?

1700
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:42,272
>> WE ARE A ROUND HOLE, AND IT'S
TIME TO GET RID OF OUR SQUARE

1701
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:42,814
PEG.

1702
01:21:42,897 --> 01:21:44,107
>> Jeff: WOW.

1703
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,692
TONY, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT
MEANS?

1704
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:48,820
>> I'M NOT TOO SURE, JEFF.

1705
01:21:48,903 --> 01:21:51,823
>> JEFF, HE HOPES HE'S NOT THE
SQUARE PEG.

1706
01:21:51,906 --> 01:21:55,118
>> THAT'S TRUE.

1707
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:56,661
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1708
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,163
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1709
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:04,628
MALCOLM, YOU'RE UP.

1710
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:14,929
>> AUBRY, YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME
TONIGHT, BUT I STILL HAVE TO

1711
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:18,516
CAST THIS VOTE JUST IN CASE, AND
AS FAR AS TONY IS CONCERNED,

1712
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,853
YOU'RE THE CLOWN THAT'S GOING
HOME, AND THE QUEEN STAYS QUEEN.

1713
01:22:21,936 --> 01:22:28,109
ADIOS.

1714
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:48,046
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

1715
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,216
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1716
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:57,222
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1717
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,181
OKAY.

1718
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:00,016
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

1719
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,936
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1720
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:03,728
IMMEDIATELY.

1721
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,272
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1722
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:11,861
FIRST VOTE AUBRY.

1723
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,572
TONY.

1724
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:18,076
AUBRY.

1725
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:18,993
TONY.

1726
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:24,958
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES TONY, TWO
VOTES AUBRY.

1727
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:25,583
TONY.

1728
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:30,463
THAT'S THREE VOTES TONY.

1729
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:31,339
TONY.

1730
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:38,304
THAT'S FOUR VOTES TONY, TWO
VOTES AUBRY.

1731
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:41,725
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GAME CHANGERS," TONY.

1732
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:47,439
THAT'S FIVE, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1733
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,941
>> SHEEP BEING LED TO THE
SLAUGHTER.

1734
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:50,900
GOOD JOB, SANDRA.

1735
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:52,277
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR
PLOTTING AGAINST ME.

1736
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,279
>> GOOD JOB.

1737
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:57,240
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU GET, AND THE
QUEEN STAYS QUEEN.

1738
01:23:57,323 --> 01:24:00,910
>> YOU GUYS ARE SUCKERS IF YOU
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

1739
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,747
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU GET, TAKE
YOUR ASS HOME.

1740
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:10,295
>> Jeff: TONY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

1741
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:14,674
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1742
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:15,258
>> BYE, TONY.

1743
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:20,388
SAY HI TO CIERA FOR ME.

1744
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,308
>> Jeff: WELL, IT'S
INTERESTING THAT BOTH VOTES HAVE

1745
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:31,316
BEEN DECIDED BY GROUPS, WHICH
MEANS IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

1746
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:34,819
BEFORE THE FINGER IS POINTED AT
YOU.

1747
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,988
GAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

1748
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:38,448
>> THANKS FOR THAT PARANOIA.

1749
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:39,282
>> Jeff: MY PLEASURE.

1750
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:40,366
GOOD NIGHT.

1751
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,294
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1752
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:52,378
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1753
01:24:55,423 --> 01:25:00,220
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX

1754
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:00,887
DAYS.

1755
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,305
>> EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.

1756
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:06,518
>> Jeff: BUT THIS SEASON THE
GAME CHANGES FAST.

1757
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:10,021
IDOLS ARE UP FOR GRABS.

1758
01:25:10,104 --> 01:25:11,189
ANIMAL INSTINCTS KICK IN.

1759
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:12,357
>> IS HE CHASING A GOAT?

1760
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,316
>> I GOT IT.

1761
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:17,195
>> I'M HUNGRY, BUT I CAN'T.

1762
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,865
>> Jeff: AND THE SURVIVORS GET
RUTHLESS.

1763
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,367
>> I GOT TO TAKE THEM OUT.

1764
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:27,580
I TOOK THEM OUT AS FAR AS I
COULD.

1765
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,207
NOW I HAVE TO LOOK FOR AN IDOL.

1766
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:32,752
>> I KNEW COMING INTO THE GAME I
WOULD HAVE TARGET ON MY BACK.

1767
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:35,171
I KNEW I WAS THE MOST VICIOUS
PLAYER OUT HERE.

1768
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,422
I TRIED TO OVERCOME THE
REPUTATION I HAD COMING INTO

1769
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:39,467
THIS GAME, BUT APPARENTLY IT GOT
THE BEST OF ME.

1770
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:42,679
AS FOR NOW SANDRA IS THE QUEEN.

1771
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:46,432
SHE MANIPULATED EVERYBODY TO
BELIEVE I WAS SCHEMING OR

1772
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:47,058
SCAMMING.

1773
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:48,393
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

1774
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,477
SHE GOT ME TONIGHT.
