1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:03,253
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:07,048
Kucha and Ogakor merged into one
tribe at equal numbers with five

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,259
members each, calling
themselves Barramundi.

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,262
The tribe set up camp on a new
beach and started from scratch.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:16,266
(<i> cheering</i> )
In a test of endurance, the

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,144
first individual immunity
challenge lasted over ten hours.

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:23,732
Tina stepped down to give the
more vulnerable Keith immunity,

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,108
so that the ex-Ogakor tribe
could take the advantage at

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,570
Tribal Council.
So, we're ruling this a deadlock

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,322
vote.
Colby and Jeff were deadlocked

11
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:35,243
into tie, so Jeff's votes at
previously Tribal Councils

12
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,329
tipped the scales, and Jeff was
voted out of the tribe.

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:43,251
Nine survivors remain.
Who will be voted out tonight?

14
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,200
>> RODGER: It's a late-sleeping
bunch, isn't it?

15
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,451
>> ALICIA: Yeah.
>> RODGER: A lot different

16
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,287
than... than us.
>> ALICIA: I know.

17
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,206
>> RODGER: Mike would've been up
three hours ago.

18
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,250
>> ALICIA: I know.
>> RODGER: Every time I do that,

19
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,002
I think about old Mike.
>> ALICIA: No kidding.

20
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,004
>> RODGER: And, you know, every
time from now on, when we're...

21
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,381
when we're around the fire, we
will think of it.

22
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:23,393
>> ALICIA: Yep.
>> RODGER: After the last Tribal

23
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,397
Council, I just felt like we had
been outwitted by Ogakor.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,276
Kucha's tribe could be picked
off very easily.

25
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,403
They're in a good position to do
that.

26
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:38,366
We could be an extinct tribe, no
longer on the face of the earth.

27
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,077
To me, it's, uh, one-on-one and
every man for himself from here

28
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:51,296
on out.
See, I can catch 'em.

29
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,593
I am in it to win just like
anybody else.

30
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,802
I'm going to give it my best
shot.

31
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:02,849
My game plan right now to try to
assure my survival is try to

32
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,936
keep catching fish.
Ooh, yes.

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,271
If they're going to vote
somebody off, it's going to

34
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:15,028
probably not be the person that
is supplying 'em with the food.

35
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,656
I think that is my greatest
asset at this time.

36
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:36,299
I love this fishing hole. Whoo!
>> NICK: Wow, look at that

37
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:41,846
crocodile.
Do not want to go in that water

38
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,516
again.
>> ALICIA: This game has

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,812
definitely changed.
There's no doubt about it.

40
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,651
It's a whole new game.
New people. New set of rules.

41
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,527
>> NICK: You keep on catching
fish, you'll definitely be the

42
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,363
last of Kutcha to go.
(<i> laughing</i> )

43
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,490
>> ALICIA: Ogakor knows they're
in a good position now to be the

44
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:05,703
last five, but they also have to
know that four members on this

45
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:11,668
jury now are going to be Kucha
members, and these people decide

46
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,504
who's going to be the winner.
They better start stepping up

47
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:25,348
and being real nice to us.
>> KEITH: I feel like I'm on a

48
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:34,357
and being real nice to us.
>> KEITH: I feel like I'm on a

49
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,026
fishing trip with you.
It's like I'm with... you're my

50
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,487
older brother and taking me
fishing.

51
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,199
>> RODGER: Everybody is-is real
nice to everybody else, but then

52
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,536
you can still see groups getting
off and talking, and you know

53
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,622
what they're talking about.
You know the million dollars for

54
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,374
being the final survivor is on
everybody's mind.

55
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,419
>> AMBER: We're exactly where we
want to be.

56
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,088
>> COLBY: As a team, Ogakor, we
outplayed 'em.

57
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,589
>> AMBER: It's just, like, I
feel, like, some pressure has

58
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,882
been lifted off my shoulders.
>> COLBY: I agree.

59
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,845
I... I'm sleeping so much better
now after getting past the merge

60
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:08,391
and the final... the final vote
to see who-who grabs the

61
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,226
majority.
>> AMBER: I know.

62
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,480
>> COLBY: And we won.
>> AMBER: Geez!

63
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:19,861
>> KEITH: Yeah, I think Ogakor
was definitely a team that

64
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,906
stayed out of vision knowing
that we needed to whittle down

65
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,493
the Kucha people.
Kucha knows what we're doing.

66
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,913
They are really good, nice
people, which does make it

67
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,623
harder as the days go on.
And the closer you become to an

68
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:38,129
individual, you start
questioning, "Geez, you know, I

69
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:43,301
like this person better than
somebody I know on my own team."

70
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,552
>> RODGER: Well, if I had to
guess, I'd say somebody in your

71
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:49,474
all's group is going to be a
millionaire.

72
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,436
>> KEITH: Well, you know, help
yourself out, my friend.

73
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,272
It just seems natural that
certain individuals gravitate to

74
00:05:56,355 --> 00:06:00,109
each other, and Tina and I have
made the decision that we want

75
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,280
to be with people we like right
at the very end.

76
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,491
>> ELISABETH: You know Rodger
has my heart. I love him.

77
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,619
>> TINA: He's a good one.
>> ELISABETH: I love him.

78
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,828
See, I knew you guys would hit
it off, too.

79
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,373
>> TINA: I like him.
You go into a merger thinking

80
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,503
that you're very much aligned
with a team, but then, as time

81
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,923
goes by, you might find out that
there's people that are more

82
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:26,052
deserving, you know?
I want this to be on an

83
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:31,432
individual basis, and I want the
good guys to win.

84
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,939
>> JERRI: Today has been just
so... weird.

85
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,483
I feel, like, a lot of distance
between myself and everybody

86
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,945
else right now.
We do have the advantage now.

87
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:48,282
We're five... Kucha's...
to Kucha's four, but that's not

88
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,575
relaxing me at all.
It's the paranoia again setting

89
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:54,455
in.
We're in a situation where Tina

90
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,875
and Keith could team up with the
Kucha people.

91
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,169
You cannot be complacent.
Your back will be stabbed faster

92
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,923
than you can spit.
(<i> clattering</i> )

93
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:13,975
Ooh!
>> TINA: Ever since the

94
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:23,442
Ooh!
>> TINA: Ever since the

95
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,571
beginning, the cooking of the
rice has been a problem.

96
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,158
It was a problem at Ogakor, and
the same problem came with us to

97
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:34,537
Barramundi.
Basically, what it is is the

98
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,664
rice has to be cooked to Jerri's
specifications.

99
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,375
It has to be stirred a certain
number of times.

100
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:43,546
The lid has to stay on.
It has to be... perfect, you

101
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,176
know, or... you-you catch it.
>> What kind of spices we

102
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,179
have tonight, ladies?
>> ELISABETH: A little parmesan

103
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,389
pizza mix.
>> ALICIA: The lemon pepper is

104
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,099
not great on the rice.
>> AMBER: It's not?

105
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,894
>> ALICIA: No.
Not great.

106
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,396
>> ELISABETH: Alicia and I were
on the side of the fire, and

107
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,773
Jerri and Amber were sitting on
a log just watching every move

108
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,569
we made.
Every time I would... I would

109
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,238
take a lid off, I could see
them, you know, tensing up,

110
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,241
like, you know, "Why is she
taking the lid off?

111
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:20,750
Why is she stirring now?"
>> AMBER: Be careful.

112
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,752
>> TINA: They're not going to
go.

113
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,794
They're not going to go.
>> AMBER: If you guys have a

114
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,796
knife, a knife might be easier
to stir.

115
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,423
>> ELISABETH: Well, don't even
worry about it.

116
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,966
>> TINA: She actually got it.
>> AMBER: You got it?

117
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,134
>> ELISABETH: Alicia and I were
getting more tense trying to

118
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,802
make it.
You know, we were testing the

119
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,971
rice.
We always test to it make sure

120
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,433
it's done, and Jerri's over on
her log.

121
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:40,937
"It's mushy," she says.
>> JERRI: Mashed potatoes.

122
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,814
>> ELISABETH: I know you don't
like mushy... but it's mushy.

123
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,776
>> ALICIA: I'll stir it until
it's done.

124
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,653
>> JERRI: I guess it doesn't
really matter.

125
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,280
It's such crappy rice, anyway.
>> ELISABETH: I felt as if I

126
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,825
were under a magnifying glass,
and I do not need to be meant to

127
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,411
feel that way at all.
Like, don't tell me what I'm

128
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,498
supposed to be doing when I'm
making you dinner. Don't.

129
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,792
>> TINA: Whenever you have a
whole bunch, it's really hard to

130
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,337
make it, I think.
Poor little old Elisabeth was

131
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,130
sitting there trying to cook the
rice, and Jerri made some

132
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,967
comments about it.
It hurt Elisabeth's feelings,

133
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,428
because here she is, trying to
help the tribe, and then to not

134
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,975
be appreciated for it and to be
judged-- that's very hurtful.

135
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,103
And I think that right there
probably was enough for

136
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,813
Elisabeth to say, "You know
what?

137
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,275
You'll get my vote."
I try to stay away from cooking,

138
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:32,446
so I don't have to be judged.
>> JERRI: Ah!

139
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,159
>> ELISABETH: Within Ogakor, I
already am spotting some cracks.

140
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,497
There is definite dissent
between Tina and Jerri.

141
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,874
Does everybody have something to
eat with?

142
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,042
>> TINA: Yes.
>> ALICIA: Okay, hold on.

143
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,504
>> COLBY: Amber? Thank you.
>> Rodger would like to say a

144
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:52,508
blessing.
>> TINA: That's a good idea.

145
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,343
>> You ready?
>> RODGER: Yes, everybody ready?

146
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,012
>> Okay.
>> RODGER: Father God, we give

147
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,681
Thee thanks today for this
beautiful Lord's day and for all

148
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,560
Thy many wonderful blessings.
We thank Thee, dear Lord, for

149
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,188
this opportunity which we have
as a group to come to know one

150
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,482
another.
>> ELISABETH: If things are

151
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,652
going to get really crazy,
especially now, you know, and

152
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,197
seeing that there is a hole in
Ogakor, it kind of opens the

153
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,866
door to really take advantage of
that.

154
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,912
If they're not all together,
their plan's kind of wrecked.

155
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,914
>> RODGER: All these things we
ask in the name of our lord and

156
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,876
savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
>> ALL: Amen.

157
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,919
>> TINA: Thank you, Rodger.
>> JERRI: That was nice.

158

00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,243
>> JEFF: How ironic that you
were the one who read the menu.

315
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,077
>> JERRI: Yeah.
>> ALICIA: Yup.

316
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,537
>> JEFF: Yeah.
>> JERRI: That is kind of

317
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,080
bizarre.
>> Way to go, Jerri.

318
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,582
>> JEFF: Anything on there
interest you in particular?

319
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,749
>> JERRI: Every last thing on
there.

320
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,042
>> JEFF: Yeah?
>> JERRI: Yeah.

321
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:29,793
>> JEFF: All right.
Let's go eat.

322
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,461
>> JERRI: Right now?
>> JEFF: Yeah.

323
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,421
>> Oh, have...
>> Bye.

324
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,131
>> Bye.
>> JERRI: This is bittersweet,

325
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,757
though, really.
(<i> all talking at once</i> )

326
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,301
>> COLBY: Please, come on.
>> JERRI: No, I'm serious.

327
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,594
>> COLBY: We're going back to
rice.

328
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,970
What do you mean?
Come on.

329
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:40,971
>> JERRI: I know, everybody's
hungry.

330
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,472
>> RODGER: ...Your help with the
rice tonight.

331
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,682
>> JERRI: Okay, good.
Good.

332
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,394
(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )
>> JEFF: You know, there is

333
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,063
enough food for one more.
Yeah, you should pick somebody

334
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,440
else to come.
>> JERRI: Who really, really,

335
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,234
really, really wants this?
>> AMBER: We all do.

336
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,736
>> We all...
>> You already won it. Just...

337
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,738
>> JEFF: Jerri, I think...
Yeah, I think it's on you.

338
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,406
>> Jerri, just pick.
>> Just pick...

339
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,949
>> Just pick...
>> JERRI: Yeah.

340
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,451
Amber.
>> AMBER: You picked me?

341
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,787
>> JERRI: You-You got...
You got the closest to me, and

342
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,665
you scared my pants.
>> AMBER: Thank you.

343
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,792
>> Bye, guys.
>> Bye, guys.

344
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,629
>> JERRI: Oh, my God.
I feel like I just won the Miss

345
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,130
America pageant.
>> AMBER: I know.

346
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,966
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> JEFF: All right, let's head

347
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,508
right over here.
Wait until you guys see the

348
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:31,104
setup.
>> JERRI: Oh!

349
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,108
>> JEFF: Jerri, you can have a
seat over here.

350
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,779
Amber...
Have her slide in here.

351
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,489
>> AMBER: Oh, my God!
Look at the rolls!

352
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,825
Oh, my God.
>> JERRI: You were just talking

353
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,161
about rolls today.
>> AMBER: I love rolls!

354
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,121
>> JERRI: Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

355
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,166
Can this really be real?
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.

356
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,335
>> JERRI: Oh, my God.
>> JEFF: Cheers to you guys.

357
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,504
Begin.
>> JERRI: Cheers!

358
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,381
>> AMBER: Cheers.
Thank you for choosing me.

359
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:02,010
>> JERRI: Thank you!
>> AMBER: Oh, my God, is that so

360
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,056
good!
>> JERRI: Iced tea.

361
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,516
>> AMBER: Let's take our first
bite.

362
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,353
>> JERRI: Oh, my gosh, I'm
eating a shrimp.

363
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,396
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.
>> JERRI: I don't even care that

364
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,982
my fingernails are completely
and totally dirty.

365
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,441
>> AMBER: There you go.
(<i> Jerri laughs</i> )

366
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,237
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.
>> JERRI: Mmm.

367
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,947
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
>> AMBER: I'm gonna try the

368
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,699
salmon.
>> JEFF: So what's going on back

369
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,034
at camp?
>> JERRI: They're making rice

370
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,745
over there, but they've got two
extra helpings of rice, so...

371
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,830
(<i> laughs</i> )
>> JEFF: Great trade off.

372
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,665
>> AMBER: Right, right.
(<i> Amber laughs</i> )

373
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,791
Yeah.
Things are going good, though,

374
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,545
as far as, like, people getting
along and everything.

375
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,216
>> ELISABETH: This is the first
time since we got here that I

376
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,426
feel just, like, kind of just
relaxed, hanging out.

377
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,761
>> KEITH: Isn't it nice?
>> ELISABETH: Enjoying dinner.

378
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,929
Yeah.
>> ALICIA: This is how it...

379
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,098
>> KEITH: What's missing?
What's making it feel that way?

380
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,725
What could that be?
How can I put my finger on that?

381
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,684
(<i> someone gasps</i> )
>> ...spaghetti.

382
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,602
>> ALICIA: You know what's kind
of weird?

383
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,271
>> KEITH: The Wicked Witch of
the West isn't here.

384
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,647
>> ALICIA: How could Amber have
acted so...

385
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,690
>> KEITH: That's what it is.
>> ALICIA: ...surprised that she

386
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,234
was the beauty queen...
>> KEITH: It's all fake.

387
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,610
>> ALICIA: ...that knew she was
going to win...

388
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,362
>> KEITH: It's all fake.
Yeah, exactly.

389
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,613
>> ALICIA: And-And, like, was,
like, "Oh, my god!"

390
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,657
>> KEITH: Did you see...?
>> ALICIA: Did you see her face?

391
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,075
I looked at her, like, "Okay,
Amber."

392
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,119
>> KEITH: You chose me?!
>> ELISABETH: It was kind of

393
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,537
funny, because everyone else
kind of felt like we won the

394
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,415
reward.
That was probably the one time I

395
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,251
felt like Barramundi.
We just kind of hung out.

396
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:19,713
Everyone kind of vented about
how they feel about Jerri, and

397
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,465
it was an eye-opener to some
people.

398
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,383
I knew it.
>> KEITH: Well, see, I cooked

399
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,593
for two Presidents, I've cooked
for all kinds of people...

400
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,470
>> ELISABETH: Have you really?
>> KEITH: And I've never, ever,

401
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,930
ever been stressed.
Other than these last so many

402
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,891
days.
>> Isn't that weird?!

403
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,227
>> KEITH: Never been stressed.
>> I can't believe that.

404
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,772
>> KEITH: Over cooking rice!
>> ALICIA: Over rice.

405
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:41,234
>> Beautiful.
>> TINA: I'm so excited.

406
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,779
I love spaghetti.
I'm so excited.

407
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,239
>> ELISABETH: This isn't gonna
make a difference to me.

408
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,408
I'll have rice.
Honestly, please, because...

409
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,451
I'm not kidding.
>> TINA: Thank you, Elisabeth.

410
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,787
>> ELISABETH: One of my worst
foods.

411
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,246
>> TINA: You are so sweet.
Thank you.

412
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,831
Thank you for, like, Elisabeth,
giving some of her spaghetti!

413
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,126
(<i> laughs</i> )
>> ELISABETH: I just haven't

414
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,879
seen you enjoy anything like
this, Tina, like no reward...

415
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,176
>> AMBER: Talk about Tina being
extra chipper...

416
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,428
She's had a constant smile on
her face since the merge.

417
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,638
>> JERRI: Mm-hmm.
>> AMBER: She's been talking in

418
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,849
a different voice.
>> JERRI: I know.

419
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,351
>> AMBER: "Oh, you want to go do
this?

420
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,852
Want to go do that?"
(<i> speaking gibberish</i> )

421
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,728
It's unbelievable.
She's a completely different

422
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,481
person.
>> JERRI: You got to really keep

423
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:23,652
your eye on Tina, 'cause she has
been acting really weird.

424
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:28,323
I'm, like, so sure that she's
going to back stab us.

425
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,659
>> AMBER: Oh, I totally agree.
>> JERRI: Well... and she'd be

426
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,370
doing it with people who would
be ready to jump ship.

427
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,579
>> AMBER: Yeah.
>> JERRI: Jump right on her

428
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,497
ship.
>> AMBER: Mm-hmm. It's a

429
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,041
completely different game.
>> JERRI: Yeah.

430
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,167
>> AMBER: Isn't it weird?
Playing for yourself is

431
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,503
definitely different.
>> JERRI: So, we need to talk to

432
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,674
Colby.
>> AMBER: Yeah.

433
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,343
>> JERRI: To making it to the
end.

434
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:59,688
>> AMBER: Yeah.
>> ELISABAETH: I just would

435
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,730
never want to have to make that
decision.

436
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,732
>> COLBY: Hey, ladies.
>> JERRI: Hi, you guys!

437
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,693
>> AMBER: Hi. We come bearing
gifts.

438
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,861
>> JERRI: You guys, we got
boomerangs.

439
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,696
There's one bent one and one
straight one for everybody.

440
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,740
>> AMBER: Everybody gets two.
It was very weird coming back to

441
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,535
the tribe after we had eaten our
meal.

442
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,787
Like, nobody even turned around
to look at us.

443
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,331
It was very uncomfortable.
I didn't like the feeling at

444
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,542
all.
>> TINA: What kind of dessert

445
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,170
did you get?
>> AMBER: I don't want to say

446
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,379
anything.
>> JERRI: I know. We-we feel...

447
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,046
guilty.
>> TINA: She doesn't want to

448
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,716
hear it.
We had a great time.

449
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,593
Don't you feel bad at all.
>> COLBY: When Jerri and Amber

450
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,346
came back, I made my way down to
the beach just to get some...

451
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,766
grab some time alone, and Jerri
came up, sat down beside me and

452
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,394
decided it was time for us to
talk.

453
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:43,106
>> JERRI: The next person Amber
and my concern... with Tina and

454
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,067
Keith taking off and gathering
three Kuchas...

455
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:51,698
>> COLBY: Mm-hmm.
>> JERRI: And coming after us.

456
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,743
She said the same as me-- like,
she wouldn't doubt it, after

457
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,621
that whole episode with Tina
before.

458
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,416
It's not good for us to just
assume that we can trust her.

459
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,751
Colby's kind of middle ground.
Nobody really knows what he's...

460
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,922
what he's going to do, and he's
not really letting anyone onto

461
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,175
what his plans are.
I mean, have you ever considered

462
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:16,806
maybe... maybe, um... even
leading Keith and Tina to

463
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:23,146
believe that you want the three
of them to be the final three?

464
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,231
>> COLBY: Keith and Tina?
>> JERRI: Yeah.

465
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,066
>> COLBY: And myself?
>> JERRI: Have you... have you

466
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,734
ever thought maybe...?
>> COLBY: Oh, they're fully

467
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,777
convinced that's what's going to
happen.

468
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,612
>> JERRI: Oh, they are?
>> COLBY: I mean, they've-

469
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,947
they've-they've thought that
for...

470
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,989
>> JERRI: For a while?
>> COLBY: Before the merge,

471
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,991
yeah.
>> JERRI: Oh, really.

472
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,117
>> COLBY; And that's been my...
>> JERRI: And you didn't tell

473
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,327
me.
>> COLBY: Oh, I'm sorry.

474
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,036
That's been my only bargain...
That's been my only bargaining

475
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,624
chip.
So, the inevitable came.

476
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,793
I was painted into a corner and-
and had to lie to her to

477
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,629
convince her that there wasn't
anything going on.

478
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,631
I just said, "Look, Jerri, Keith
owes me one on this.

479
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:54,177
"He and Tina think that the
three of us are going into the

480
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,429
finals," which is the truth,
but Jerri thinks it's just a

481
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:02,102
ploy.
You and I and Amber still have

482
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,188
complete control of this thing.
>> JERRI: Okay, 'cause I-I was

483
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:10,193
completely unaware that, at this
point, you were leading Tina and

484
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,987
Keith to believe that it was
going to be the three of you.

485
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,154
>> COLBY: I haven't held led
'em.

486
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,364
They've assumed that.
>> JERRI: Okay.

487
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,992
>> COLBY: Jerri doesn't deserve
to win this thing, if for no

488
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,494
other reason, simply because of
the way she's treated the people

489
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,538
around her.
And that was the biggest

490
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,873
decision when I had to choose
between carrying my plans out

491
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,502
with either Amber and Jerri or
Keith and Tina.

492
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,879
Yeah, everything's cool.
>> JERRI: And this is the deal.

493
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,172
>> AMBER: Do you think it makes
sense?

494
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,341
>> JERRI: No, no, I didn't even,
like, have to talk to him about

495
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,342
that.
>> AMBER: Oh, really?

496
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,844
>> JERRI: Yeah, because he...
>> AMBER: Okay, go.

497
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,139
>> JERRI: He, um, filled me in
on something I was completely

498
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,390
unaware of.
>> COLBY: Yeah. I didn't like

499
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,810
the fact that I had to lie, but
because I was lying to Jerri, I

500
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,855
didn't lose sleep over it.
>> AMBER: Give me a hug.

501
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,233
I really owe you one.
>> COLBY: Are you so full of

502
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:50,942
food, you can't?
Is that tummy full right now,

503
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:55,071
there?
>> JERRI: I want a hug.

504
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,156
>> AMBER: The biggest it's ever
been.

505
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,533
>> JERRI: I buy it.
I-I-I believe him, 'cause-'cause

506
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,701
to him... to him, right now,
winning means everything.

507
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,872
So, I mean, I'm... I'm looking
at this whole thing right now

508
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,167
as, yes, we are working as a
team to get to a specific point,

509
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,545
and so that doesn't leave me
feeling very vulnerable at this

510
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:19,763
point.
>> ALICIA: Oh, boy.

511
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,224
Is that it?
>> NICK: Bits and pieces.

512
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,185
Want to open that?
>> ALICIA: No, let's go.

513
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,895
Let's wait.
>> NICK: Screw them.

514
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,440
Open it now.
>> ALICIA: (<i> laughs</i> )

515
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:35,570
Hey, you guys, we got tree mail!
>> NICK: Ah, let see what we got

516
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,323
here.
I love puzzles.

517
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:45,747
>> ALICIA: A-ha!
One more.

518
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,208
>> NICK: This is the last piece.
Probably just a straight line,

519
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,711
you guys.
"When marking your land, there

520
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,089
can be no doubt."
>> ALICIA: "Just fence off your

521
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,258
spot and keep others out."
>> NICK: "You must plan ahead if

522
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,928
you want to succeed.
It's hip to be square, if it's

523
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,598
immunity you need."
>> ALICIA: Wow.

524
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,767
>> NICK: What can it be?
Very interesting.

525
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,397
Uh, we got tree mail, and, uh,
it says for our immunity

526
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,608
challenge, uh, we got to keep
others out of your land and

527
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,777
fence each... everybody off.
>> AMBER: That is very

528
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,946
interesting.
>> TINA: Cool. What if it's like

529
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,948
one of those...?
>> ALICIA: Whatever you think it

530
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,784
is, think something else.
>> JERRI: Right, right.

531
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,830
Alicia right now is our biggest
threat by far.

532
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:32,085
She's got the guns, and she out-
strengthens even the men.

533
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:37,757
The men are sweating it right
now over Alicia, so I think

534
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,386
she... she probably knows that,
and it's probably very important

535
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,638
to her to win immunity right
now.

536
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,849
>> RODGER: Just... just hang in
there and do your best, kiddo.

537
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:50,311
>> ALICIA: Okay.
>> RODGER: All we can... we can

538
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,980
do.
>> ALICIA: That's it.

539
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,954
>> JEFF: I'll take back the
immunity necklace from you,

540
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:11,040
Keith.
Put it right back here.

541
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,544
Up for grabs again.
Today's immunity challenge has

542
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,172
nothing to do with age or
strength.

543
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,383
It's all about how you think.
We've created a challenge using

544
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:24,345
posts and rope.
The object of the game: connect

545
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,224
the ropes to the poles to make
as many squares as possible.

546
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,561
You'll each take turns
connecting one rope at a time.

547
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,647
If it's your rope that completes
the square, you drop a disk in

548
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,025
it, you go again.
Person with the most squares at

549
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:42,113
the end wins immunity, cannot be
voted out at tonight's Tribal

550
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,991
Council. Ready to go?
Head over here to your disks,

551
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,410
and we'll start.
The order in which you'll take

552
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,580
your turns we determined by
drawing numbers outs of a hat.

553
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,041
Jerri, you're up.
You're going to start it.

554
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:05,470
Keith.
All right, Amber, you're up.

555
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,520
All right, Tina, you're up.
Okay, Alicia, your turn.

556
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:20,068
All right, Elisabeth.
Go, Kentucky Joe.

557
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:26,824
Let's go, Colby.
All right, Nick.

558
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,577
Okay, now it gets a little
harder, 'cause any move you

559
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,412
make's going to either going to
give you a box or set somebody

560
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,083
else up for a run, so choose
wisely.

561
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:43,216
A gift. First on the board.
Somebody's going to have a good

562
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,719
run in a minute.
Getting tough out there.

563
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,805
>> ALICIA: It's getting tough.
>> ELISABETH: You can all thank

564
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,433
me later.
Nick can thank me now.

565
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,275
>> JEFF: Nick has one.
Amber has one.

566
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,150
>> COLBY: Did you leave Rodger a
square?

567
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,152
>> NICK: No.
>> COLBY: Come on, Rodg, help

568
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,405
your brother out.
>> JEFF: Now you're brothers.

569
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,197
>> RODGER: Yeah.
>> COLBY: Me and Rodg-- we go

570
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,033
way back.
>> RODGER: All family now.

571
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,287
>> COLBY: Four days.
>> JEFF: No box for Rodger.

572
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,539
Let's see what he left for
Colby.

573
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,129
Colby has one.
See if he gets another one.

574
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:34,100
Colby has two.
>> COLBY: There you go, Jerri.

575
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,815
>> JEFF: Looks like Jerri's on a
run.

576
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:45,153
Oh, that hurts.
Good run. Six.

577
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,989
Jerri in the lead.
Keith is anxiously awaiting your

578
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,117
next move.
>> JERRI: I'm sure he is.

579
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,592
>> JEFF: Nine.
Keith, you hit the jackpot.

580
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,887
I guess you have Jerri to thank
for that. 15.

581
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,348
>> AMBER: Girl, you set him up.
>> JERRI: Yes, I did.

582
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,226
>> JEFF: 16.
17.

583
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,687
>> KEITH: All good things come
to an end, though.

584
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,023
>> JERRI: I want a massage.
>> JEFF: Good run.

585
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,150
Keith in the lead with 17.
>> JERRI: Whoo!

586
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:30,198
>> JEFF: Amber, think you can
make a dent in Keith's 17?

587
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,044
>> AMBER: I got 'em all, right?
>> RODGER: Yeah, you got 'em

588
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,797
all.
>> AMBER: Ah, this is killing

589
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,550
me!
>> TINA: It's killing me too.

590
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,011
>> Let's go.
>> AMBER: Oh, you guys.

591
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:08,528
>> JEFF: Tina has a plan.
14. 15.

592
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,699
16. All right, Tina, you got 16.
Keith's got 17.

593
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,410
You got to find one more spot on
the board.

594
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,745
This is for immunity.
>> TINA: Yep, and I think that's

595
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,873
all of mine.
>> JEFF: Good effort, Tina.

596
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,918
Not good enough.
Mathematically impossible for

597
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:27,547
Keith to be beat.
Nicely done, Keith.

598
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,549
You get the immunity necklace
again.

599
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,885
Congratulations.
>> TINA: Good job.

600
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,595
>> JEFF: Feels good, doesn't it?
You're getting used to that.

601
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,097
All right, you guys can head
back to camp.

602
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,767
I'll see you tonight at Tribal
Council, where one of you will

603
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:45,064
be voted out of the tribe.
Somebody's going home tonight.

604
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:19,348
>> ELISABETH: Lightning.
>> TINA: Whoa, that was close.

605
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:26,147
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )
(<i> lightning crashes</i> )

606
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,194
>> RODGER: I love it here in the
Australian outback! Whoo-hoo!

607
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:35,615
>> KEITH: Mysteriously, every
time we go to Tribal Council, we

608
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:41,996
have a rainstorm.
I don't know what that means,

609
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,125
but you have to think there's
something working there of

610
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,295
stronger powers than we're aware
of.

611
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,804
>> ALICIA: Elisabeth thinks that
the next vote at Tribal Council

612
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,222
will go for Jerri.
I think Elisabeth is naive in a

613
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,810
lot of ways.
You know, Colby and Keith and

614
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,187
Tina would be foolish to vote
Jerri off.

615
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,397
It would put them at a
disadvantage.

616
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,026
So Nick and I both feel like
it's going to be one of us that

617
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:16,823
they're targeting.
>> ELISABETH: I'm hoping that

618
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,826
that swing vote to get Jerri off
is Tina.

619
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,328
But I really think Jerri is a
goner tonight.

620
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:26,040
And I just want to keep playing.
I'm not ready to go home.

621
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,543
I'm not ready to see my friends
go, either.

622
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,378
Tribal Council is going to be
much more interesting than the

623
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:38,177
last, and... who knows what is
going to happen?

624
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,081
>> JEFF: Always seems to rain at
Tribal Council.

625
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,457
Elisabeth, talk about the tribes
merging, now that you've had a

626
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:12,253
few days.
Has it been an interesting

627
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,423
dynamic in two different ways of
living coming together now and

628
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,634
forming a new way of living?
>> ELISABETH: It has.

629
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,803
It's been quite interesting.
I mean, I think that we probably

630
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,472
couldn't have done things in a
more opposite way when you look

631
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,476
at the two tribes.
I-I just think that the

632
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,230
differences are known.
I mean, sometimes it's tricky,

633
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:36,110
and you get used to doing things
your own way, but, um, then you

634
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,821
realize that, well, there might
be a more efficient way also, so

635
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,783
there's been compromise, and I
think it's worked to our benefit

636
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,370
as a group so far.
>> JEFF: What was the reaction

637
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,332
last night, Amber, when you and
Jerri came back with little

638
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,627
bellies from a nice meal?
>> AMBER: It was a very weird

639
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,964
feeling, a guilty kind of
feeling, and I couldn't help but

640
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,635
feel like somewhat of an
outsider for a little while.

641
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,012
>> JEFF: So, what was it like
for you guys not having two

642
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,140
people around last night?
Different feeling, Alicia?

643
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,516
>> ALICIA: It was interesting
going back to camp just having

644
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,810
seven people.
It was, you know, a little

645
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,272
quieter, and everybody was, you
know, kind of contemplating the

646
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,317
situation, and... and our
situation.

647
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,986
Uh, a lot of us had already
resigned ourselves to the fact

648
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,114
that we'd be having rice that
night, so, um... it was... it

649
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,991
was all good.
>> JEFF: Well, you nine have

650
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:29,997
reached... really the final
phase: the last leg of<i> Survivor.</i>

651
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,666
Someone will be voted out of the
tribe tonight, but they don't go

652
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:36,379
home.
They become a part of that jury,

653
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:40,758
and will have a big part in how
this thing plays out, because

654
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,220
the jury will ultimately decide
who the winner is.

655
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,974
You each have, right now, a one
in nine shot at a million bucks.

656
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,851
So, this game is really shifted
now.

657
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,436
The goal is get to the final two
with the goodwill of the other

658
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,359
seven.
Every vote from here on out

659
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,697
counts, so you better think
about that when you're casting

660
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,199
your vote, because the game has
changed.

661
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,994
Let's vote.
Elisabeth, you're first.

662
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,341
>> ELISABETH: Tonight I'm voting
for Jerri.

663
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,552
I just feel it's her time to go,
and she gets really cranky when

664
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:29,140
she's hungry, and it's bumming
me out a little.

665
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,956
>> AMBER: My vote's for Alicia,
and girl, you're strong inside

666
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,376
and out.
That's the main reason why I

667
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,754
have to vote for you-- because
you're threatening.

668
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,923
So, this is a respect vote, and
I'm going to miss you a lot.

669
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,614
>> RODGER: Nice kid, but way too
loud.

670
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:37,458
Way too loud.
>> JERRI: Alicia, not only do

671
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:46,634
Way too loud.
>> JERRI: Alicia, not only do

672
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,136
you intimidate the hell out of
the women around here, but also

673
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,807
the men.
They are scared to death of you.

674
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,936
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

675
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:06,612
(<i> music playing</i> )
Once the votes are tallied, the

676
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:17,873
(<i> music playing</i> )
Once the votes are tallied, the

677
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,835
decision is final, the person
will be asked to leave the

678
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,921
Tribal Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

679
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:34,056
First vote...
Jerri.

680
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,437
Very muscular...
(<i> laughing</i> )

681
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,689
Alicia.
>> ALICIA: Who did that?

682
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:47,570
Who did that?
>> JEFF: Jerri.

683
00:40:53,409 --> 00:41:02,376
Alicia.
Alicia.

684
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:15,806
Alicia.
Jerri.

685
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:25,149
Jerri.
Four votes Jerri, four votes

686
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:31,697
Alicia.
Final vote...

687
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,870
Alicia.
Alicia, you need to bring me

688
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,414
your torch.
>> ALICIA: Okay.

689
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,250
Listen, bear in mind, be safe,
everybody here.

690
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:43,959
>> See you in three days.
>> ALICIA: See you all in three

691
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:50,925
days.
Thank you; thanks, guys.

692
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,220
Thank you, sweetie.
Be good.

693
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,602
>> JEFF: Alicia, the tribe has
spoken.

694
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:09,735
It's time for you to go.
>> ALICIA: Bye, guys.

695
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,409
>> JEFF: Grab your torches and
head back to camp.

696
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:21,372
Good night.
(<i> music playing</i> )

697
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,639
>> ALICIA: I have to say that I
was expecting this.

698
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,684
We knew there was going to be a
threat, and I just hope somebody

699
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:46,480
from Kucha can take this thing
out and break Ogakor's spirit.

700
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:49,942
It's all good, though.
Now I get to sit on the jury and

701
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:55,281
watch everything that happens.
Peace, out.
