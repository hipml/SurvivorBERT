1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,630
THIS TIME I'M PLAYING LIKE A
CRIMINAL.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:09,092
IF YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT US
TALKING, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,554
THERE ARE SMALL WINDOWS OF
OPPORTUNITY IN THIS GAME, AND IF

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,556
YOU MISS THEM, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO WIN.

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,976
I SWORE TO MYSELF I'M GONNA MAKE
BIG MOVES.

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,896
DON'T YOU THINK TO BE IN WITH
THE ENEMY COULD BE A GOOD THING?

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,940
I MADE MOVES THAT OTHER PEOPLE
WERE SCARED TO MAKE.

8
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,233
I WILL GIVE YOU MY ADVANTAGE.

9
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,944
I MADE MOVES THAT I WAS SCARED
TO MAKE.

10
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,112
YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,113
I'M GOING TO USE MY ADVANTAGE.

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,240
AND IT WORKED.

13
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:39,289
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jeff: WELCOME TO THE

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,917
"SURVIVOR" LIVE REUNION "GAME
CHANGER" SEASON WHERE SARAH HAS

15
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,294
JUST WON $1 MILLION.

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,130
CONGRATULATIONS ON A REALLY
NICELY PLAYED GAME.

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,801
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, BEFORE WE GET INTO YOU,

18
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,219
GLENN, GIVE ME A BIG SHOT OF
EVERYBODY.

19
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,180
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO
ALL YOU GUYS BECAUSE THIS REALLY

20
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:59,642
WAS A GREAT SEASON, AND TO GIVE
UP WHAT YOU GIVE UP AND TO DO

21
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,812
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR
FAMILIES AND YOUR JOBS AND YOUR

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,482
LIVELIHOODS AND TO COME OUT HERE
AND PLAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

23
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,483
IT WAS REALLY FUN.

24
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:10,153
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
ALL RIGHT, SO, SARAH, I THINK

25
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,491
ONE OF THE BIGGEST, REALLY
BIGGEST GAME-CHANGING MOVES OF

26
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,202
THE ACCEPT FOR YOU WAS YOUR VERY
SIMPLE-- YOUR SWITCH OF

27
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,329
PHILOSOPHY FROM COP TO CRIMINAL.

28
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,624
AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY
INTERESTING IS YOU ENDED UP

29
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,460
PLAYING A LOT LIKE YOUR FORMER
ADVERSARY, TONY.

30
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,129
DID YOU FIND SOME TRUTH IN THAT?

31
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:35,470
>> RIGHT, SO, IN CAGYAN, WE SAW
HOW THAT WORKED OUT FOR ME AND

32
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,055
HOW IT WORKED OUT FOR TONY.

33
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:42,727
I HAD A FRONT-ROW SEAT TO WATCH
TONY PLAY SO MASTERFULLY.

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,604
AND HE WAS SO SUCCESSFUL AT IT
--

35
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,356
>> WAS HE REALLY A MENTOR IN
THAT SENSE?

36
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,233
>> ABSOLUTELY.

37
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:53,363
AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T GET ABOUT
TONY IS THE GUY CALLED ME AT

38
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,365
5:30 IN THE MORNING EVERY
MORNING PREPPING ME FOR THE

39
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,700
SHOW, BUT HE WAS, LIKE, TRYING
TO PREP HIMSELF.

40
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,662
AND HE'S LIKE, "GET UP, YOU
BUM."

41
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,873
I'M LIKE,"IT'S 5:30, DUDE."

42
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,418
HE'S LIKE, "YO, SARA, WE'VE GOT
TO TALK."

43
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,670
>> Jeff: SO HE WAS TRYING TO
HELP YOU.

44
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,420
>> YEAH.

45
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,380
>> Jeff: I HAVE ANOTHER
QUESTION.

46
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,589
>> SURE.

47
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,260
>> Jeff: YOU SAID SOMETHING
THAT CONTINUES TO BAFFLE ME THAT

48
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:19,931
SURVIVOR IS A GAME BY DEFINITION
OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.

49
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,058
AS TAI SAID, IT'S ABOUT
DECEIVING.

50
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,061
HOW DO YOU DO THE SLEIGHT OF
HAND WITH EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL

51
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,145
POLITICS.

52
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,272
AND YOU SAID I HAD TO GET
PERMISSION FROM MY FRIENDS.

53
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:31,401
WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT FOR
PEOPLE TO KNOW THEIR FRIENDS

54
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,111
WILL KNOW UNEMPLOYMENT I'M NOT
THIS PERSON.

55
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,571
>> SO NOBODY WANTS TO GO OUT AND
MAKE THEIR FAMILY, THEIR

56
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,907
FRIENDS, THER PROFESSION LOOK
BAD, SO THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED,

57
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,576
THAT WEIGHED HEAVILY ON ME.

58
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,954
IN ORDER TO COME OUT AND BE
SUCCESSFUL, I HAD TO LET THAT

59
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,205
GO.

60
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,292
I WAS GIVEN THE RIGHT OF WAY BY
EVERYBODY, AND I JUST CAME OUT

61
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,420
GUNS A-BLATION BECAUSE THE GATES
WERE OPEN FOR ME TO DO WHATEVER

62
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,254
I HAD TO DO.

63
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,423
>> Jeff: KNOWING THEY WOULD
LOVE YOU.

64
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,632
>> KNOWING THEY KNOW WHO I AM.

65
00:02:54,716 --> 00:03:01,389
AND IN FACT, THEY KIND OF BEAT
ME DOWN FOR NOT BEING MORE LIKE

66
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:01,681
THAT THE FIRST TIME.

67
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,932
SO YEAH.

68
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,436
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO HAVE THEIR
BLESSING TO COME OUT AND PLAY

69
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,312
THIS WAY.

70
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,398
EVEN THOUGH I HURT A LOT OF
PEOPLE OOP.

71
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,858
IT'S NOT EASY TO WATCH BACK.

72
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,402
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE GAME I
PLAYED.

73
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,155
I'M NOT PROUD OF HOW I TREATED
PEOPLE.

74
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,573
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU CAN'T HAVE
IT BOTH WAYS.

75
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,949
THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER DISCUSSION.

76
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,075
>> RIGHT.

77
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,161
>> Jeff: THAT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS "SURVIVOR" SHOWS IS YOU

78
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,120
HAVE TO OWN IT BECAUSE THE JURY
WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE.

79
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,955
CULPEPPER, IT COMES DOWN TO ONE
BIG DECISION.

80
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,125
I WAS WATCHING WITH FRIENDS
BACKSTAGE AND THEY WERE RIVETTED

81
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,253
WITH THE DECISION BEING MADE
AMONG THE FOUR OF YOU, WHO IS

82
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,964
GOING TO GO TO THE JURY-- IN
THIS CASE TAI-- AND WHO IS GOING

83
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,174
TO GO TO THE FINAL THREE.

84
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,802
YOU SAID AS YOU'RE VOTING TAI
OUT, AND YOU SAID IN THE SHOW,

85
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,930
"I FEEL LIKE I CAN BEAT
ANYBODY."

86
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:46,309
SO I JUST WANT TO WALK THROUGH
THAT.

87
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,811
HERE ARE THE VOTES.

88
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,939
GLENN, SHOW THE VOTES OF THE
TRIBAL.

89
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:51,981
WE DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS.

90
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,441
LET'S SEE WHO EVERYBODY VOTED
FOR.

91
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,695
BECAUSE WHAT I'M WONDERING IS,
DID YOU MISCALCULATE?

92
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,198
>> CLEARLY
( LAUGHTER ).

93
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,494
>> Jeff: BUT, NO, SPECIFICALLY
DYOU MISCALCULATE THE BITTERNESS

94
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,372
THAT YOU THOUGHT THE JURY MIGHT
HAVE TOWARD WHAT SARAH JUST

95
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,832
SAID, WHICH IS HURTING THEIR
FEELINGS.

96
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,625
>> I DID.

97
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,168
BUT FIRST, CLEARLY LET ME SAY
THIS.

98
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,503
I CLEARLY NEEDED A SNICKERS OUT
HERE, I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT

99
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,006
HERE, AND I HATED WATCHING THAT,
BEING THE BULLY.

100
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,132
TAI, I LOVE YOU.

101
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,344
AND WE HAD A COMPLICATED
RELATIONSHIP.

102
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:30,687
( APPLAUSE )
TAI, WE WERE TOGETHER.

103
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,688
I WAS FRUSTRATED.

104
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,022
AND IT CAME ACROSS TERRIBLE.

105
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,315
AND I APOLOGIZE.

106
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,149
THAT IS AWFUL.

107
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,528
>> OH, NO YOU DON'T NEED TO
APOLOGIZE.

108
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,112
IT'S A GAME.

109
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,530
YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT GUY.

110
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,198
>> I LOVE YOU.

111
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,408
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER.

112
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,534
NO, NO, NO.

113
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,535
THIS IS PERFECT.

114
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,869
LET'S FORGET WHAT I JUST ASKED.

115
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,704
>> OKAY.

116
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,414
>> Jeff: BECAUSE, STAY WITH
WITH ME.

117
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,415
STAY WITH ME.

118
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,210
THAT EMOTION THAT YOU JUST
TALKED ABOUT "I WAS SO

119
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:54,836
FRUSTRATED WITH TAI.

120
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,253
OF.

121
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,337
>> YEAH, I WAS.

122
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,505
>> Jeff: HAD AN IMPACT IN YOU
VOTING TAI OUT, RIGHT?

123
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,423
>> YES.

124
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:03,177
>> Jeff: SO NOW YOU
MISCALCULATED WITH SARA,

125
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:03,594
CLEARLY.

126
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:03,970
SHE WON, RIGHT?

127
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,847
>> YES, YES.

128
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,890
>> Jeff: LET'S SEE WHAT WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED.

129
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,559
LET'S PLAY A PRETEND GAME.

130
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,393
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT GAME.

131
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,310
>> Jeff: BUT I LOVE IT.

132
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,230
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, WHEN YOU'RE
OUT THERE --

133
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,606
>> I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME.

134
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,734
CULPEPPER, COME OIT'S FUN.

135
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:22,238
YOU LIKE GAMES.

136
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,406
BUT WHAT?

137
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,616
>> THE FEELING YOU HAVE OUT
THERE, EVEN THE PERCEPTION OF

138
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,911
THE JURY OUT THERE, IS MUCH
DIFFERENT THAN IT WOULD BE NOW.

139
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,746
>> Jeff: I UNDERSTAND THAT.

140
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,581
I TRUST THE JURY TO BE HONEST
WITH ME.

141
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,499
JUST GO WITH ME.

142
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,919
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE AT TRIBAL
WITH ANY CULPEPPER.

143
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,047
MONICA OR BRAD.

144
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,257
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY, SO, SARAH, YOU'RE ON THE

145
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,924
JURY.

146
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,342
TAI, YOU'RE IN THE FINAL THREE.

147
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,055
OF THE PEOPLE--
>> NO, I'M FOUR.

148
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,598
>> YOU'RE FINAL.

149
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,807
>> Jeff: COME ON, GUYS.

150
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,603
>> IF I HAD CUT YOU LIKE, THAT
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE VOTE FORWARD

151
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,687
ME.

152
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,606
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER, WILL YOU
JUST STOP FOR A SECOND!

153
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,442
( LAUGHTER )
SO EVERYBODY THAT'S IN THE JURY,

154
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,737
INCLUDING SARA, BUT NOT YOU,
TAI, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOW IN THE

155
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,613
FINAL THREE.

156
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,448
WHO WOULD HAVE VOTE FORWARD
BRAD?

157
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,034
HOW MANY PEOPLE.

158
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:08,743
OKAY.

159
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,953
YOU'RE NOT IN THE JURY, TROYZAN!

160
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,956
HOLD YOUR HANDS UP!

161
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,460
HALI, DEBBIE, ZEKE, SIERRA,
ANDREA.

162
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,669
SO THAT'S FIVE VOTES.

163
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,590
THE OTHER FIVE WOULD YOU HAVE
VOTED FOR SARAH-- I MEAN TAI?

164
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,425
>> YEAH, I THINK SO.

165
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,095
>> Jeff: OKAY, SO FIVE-- OKAY,
SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER

166
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,139
TALKED ABOUT, AND IT'S A PERFECT
TIME.

167
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,308
EVERYBODY ASKS, WHAT, WOULD DO
YOU IN THE CASE OF A TIE AT

168
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,518
FINAL TRIBAL?

169
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,645
WE WOULD HAVE HAD ONE HAD YOU
SAID "YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING

170
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,646
TO KEEP TAI AND GET RID OF
SARAH."

171
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,773
WE WOULD HAVE HAD HAD A TIE,
5-5.

172
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,982
THIS IS THE RULE.

173
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,944
HS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN A
FUTURE SEASON.

174
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,654
THE PERSON WHO WAS NOT IN THE
TIE.

175
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,156
WE HAVE BRAD WITH FIVE, TAI WITH
FIVE.

176
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,870
TROYZAN, YOU GO TO THE JURY AND
DECIDE THE FINAL VOTE.

177
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,663
>> WOW!

178
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,792
>> Jeff: SO, TROYZAN, IN THIS
CASE--

179
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:04,340
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

180
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,343
TROYZAN, IN THIS CASE, HONESTLY,
BACK THEN, NOT WATCHING THE

181
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:11,639
SHOW, WHEN YOU WERE IN THAT
MOMENT, WHO WOULD YOU HAVE VOTED

182
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,056
FOR?

183
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,682
>> TAI, SAY IT.

184
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:17,478
>> IF IT WAS TAI OR BRAD?

185
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:17,728
BRAD.

186
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,896
BRAD.

187
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,022
>> Jeff: SO, CULPEPPER, I
BRING THIS UP BECAUSE-- AND YOU

188
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,026
GUYS ARE-- ARE MAKING IT
DIFFICULT TO MAKE THIS POINT.

189
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,197
( LAUGHTER )
BUT I BELIEVE THE JURY'S TELLING

190
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,365
THE TRUTH.

191
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,869
AND THE REASON I'M BRINGING IT
UP IS IT SHOWS HOW HARD THIS

192
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,870
GAME IS.

193
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,664
YOU ACTUALLY DID PLAY A GAME
GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN.

194
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,708
AND ONE DECISION WILL HAUNT YOU.

195
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,335
YOU MADE ONE WRONG DECISION.

196
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,838
>> OH, NO.

197
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,215
>> Jeff: IT WILL HAUNT YOU
BECAUSE I WILL BE STAYING TO YOU

198
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,049
ALL THE TIME.

199
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,843
ANYWAY, THAT'S HOW TOUGH THIS
GAME IS.

200
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,763
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
LET IT GO.

201
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,682
I'M MOVING ON.

202
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,603
AND IT'S NOT LOST ON ME, SARAH,
THAT THE-- THE-- NO, THAT THE

203
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,564
NUANCED WAY IN WHICH YOU
MANEUVERED THAT KNOWING WHAT

204
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,818
NEEDED TO HAPPEN SHOWS YOUR
SOCIAL PLAY AT WORK.

205
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,861
BRILLIANT.

206
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,779
TAI, WHY IS THIS GAME SO HARD
FOR YOU EMOTIONALLY?

207
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,239
WHAT IS IT?

208
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,365
>> OH, MY GOD.

209
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,783
I THINK IT'S JUST IN MY NATURE.

210
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:19,373
IT'S SO HARD STORY ME TO-- IT'S
EASY TO BE NICE AND KIND AND

211
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,542
TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.

212
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,420
BRAD DOES A LOT AT CAMP.

213
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,088
HE CARES FOR THE CAMP AND
EVERYTHING ELSE.

214
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,758
IT'S JUST, I DON'T KNOW, I GO
INTO THIS GAME.

215
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,595
I SAY IT'S EYE GAME.

216
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,307
SOMEHOW OUT-- I ALWAYS GET WHAT
I WANT OUTSIDE OF THE GAME, I

217
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,143
SLOWLY CAN MANIPULATE PEOPLE TO
GET WHAT I WANT.

218
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,605
SOMEHOW, IN SOME GAME, IT JUST
SEEMS BIGGER-- I JUST --

219
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,066
>> BUT WHY IS IT EMOTIONAL?

220
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,237
TO SARAH'S QUESTION, WHY DO YOU
NEED TO ALWAYS BE KIND AND NICE?

221
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,739
IF YOUR FRIENDS GAVE YOU
PERMISSION TO LIE, WOULD YOU BE

222
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,490
ABLE TO?

223
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:56,786
>> I GIVE MYSELF PERMISSION TO
LIE.

224
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,997
ON THE SHOW ITSELF, IT'S NOTABLY
TO DO IT.

225
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,459
I GO TO MY HEART INSTANTLY.

226
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,796
THERE ARE SO MANY CHANCES I FEEL
I SHOULD BE PLAYING THE IDOL AND

227
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,630
I DON'T.

228
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,131
I KNOW I FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE
GAME.

229
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,883
I KNOW HOW THE GAME IS GOING.

230
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,134
AND SMOWRK I DON'T KNOW.

231
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,137
IT IS JUST REALLY HARD-- IT'S
JUST NOT IN MY NATURE.

232
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,639
AND I HOPE I GROW FROM IT.

233
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:23,145
IF YOU EVER WANT ME BACK --
>> I LOVE HEARING THAT.

234
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,982
CIRIE, I HAVE TO GO DOWN TO YOU.

235
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,985
WE SAW THE RECEPTION YOU
RECEIVED EARLIER.

236
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,948
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CIRIE, SO, I THINK THIS IS A

237
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,158
QUESTION I SINCERELY AM
INTERESTED IN.

238
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,326
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

239
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,871
LIKE, I WOULD ALWAYS SAY ABOUT
YOU,"WELL, SHE'S THE WOMAN WHO

240
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,791
GOT UP OFF THE COACH," WHICH
MEANT TO ME, YOU'RE THE WOMAN

241
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,878
WHO THOUGHT, "COULD I DO THAT?"
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT

242
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,421
YOU?

243
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,672
WHAT DO YOU REPRESENT?

244
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:58,014
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, I THINK THAT
BECAUSE I HAVE, LIKE-- OR I HAVE

245
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:02,310
HAD SO MANY INSECURITIES ABOUT
MYSELF-- I'M MY HARDEST CRITIC.

246
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:07,690
AND I DON'T COME IN TO ANY
SITUATION JUDGING ANYONE BECAUSE

247
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,941
WHO AM I TO JUDGE ANYONE?

248
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:16,240
AND I THINK BECAUSE I AM NOT UP
HERE LIKE A BIG ATHLETE AND I'M

249
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,494
NOT, LIKE, A CRAZY CHALLENGE
BEAST, I'M MORE LIKE EVERYBODY

250
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,203
ELSE AT HOME.

251
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,747
SO I'M EASY TO RELATE TO.

252
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,540
I'M NOT THREATENING TO ANYONE.

253
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,043
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO, JEFF?

254
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,714
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE ARGUINGURE
YOU'RE THE EVERY PERSON IN THAT

255
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,506
SENSE?

256
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,384
LET'S BOIL IT DOWN TO ITS
ESSENCE.

257
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,721
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
WATCHING LIKE YOU FOR YEARS AND

258
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,515
YEARS DEBATING, I SHOULD DO IT.

259
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,853
>> THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DO IT,
JEFF.

260
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,898
DO YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
YOU ASKED ME THAT 12IERS YEARS

261
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:49,482
AGO.

262
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,650
I SAID STAY ON THE COUCH.

263
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,070
GET OFF THE COUCH AND GO OUT AND
DO IT.

264
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,238
>> Jeff: WHAT DOES IT MAKE
TAKE?

265
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,742
WHAT IS THE IBGREEDIENT FOR A
GOOD PLAYER?

266
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,244
JUST PHILOSOPHICALLY.

267
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,706
>> YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
CONNECT WITH PEOPLE ON A GENERAL

268
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,874
PERSON-TO-PERSON LEVEL.

269
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,584
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN AND HEAR WHAT
THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY.

270
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,752
YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR
FAMILIES.

271
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,588
YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR
FEARS.

272
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,965
YOU HAVE TO LEARN SOMETHING
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE TO RELATE TO

273
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,092
THEM.

274
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,886
IF YOU CAN'T ISRAEL TO THEM,
IT'S LIKE TALKING TO A BRICK

275
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,720
WALL.

276
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,764
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THEIR
VOTE.

277
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,266
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE
HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT

278
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,936
TONIGHT, INCLUDING ONE OF THE
BIGGEST MOMENTS IN ANY SEASON OF

279
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,603
"SURVIVOR."

280
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,399
IT MADE NEWS AROUND THE WORLD.

281
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,401
PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT
IT.

282
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,112
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY IT WAS
A CULTURAL MILESTONE WHEN ZEKE

283
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:41,117
WAS OUTED AS BEING TRANSGENDER.

284
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,958
>> WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ANYONE
YOU'RE TRANSGENDER?

285
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,961
>> Jeff: ZEKE, AND JEFF VARNER
ARE NEXT.

286
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:52,461
( APPLAUSE )

287
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,731
I DIDN'T WANNA BE LIKE
THE TRANS "SURVIVOR" PLAYER.

288
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,651
I WANTED TO BE ZEKE THE
"SURVIVOR" PLAYER.

289
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,152
>> AND YOU ARE.

290
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,987
>> I FEEL LIKE I AM.

291
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,821
>> YOU ARE.

292
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,822
<i>.</i>

293
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:27,830
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: WELL, IT WAS ONE OF

294
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,000
THE BIGGEST GAME-CHANGING MOVES
OF ALL TIME ON ANY SHOW ANYWHERE

295
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,170
AND IT BECAME A WORLDWIDE
CULTURAL MOMENT.

296
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,921
IT STARTED SO MANY
CONVERSATIONS.

297
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:40,676
IT BROUGHT AWARENESS TO WHAT IT
IS TO BE TRANSGENDER.

298
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,552
I'M STILL HEARING FROM FAMILIES
WHO SAID IT GAVE THEM AN

299
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,512
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THEIR
KIDS ABOUT IT.

300
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,183
AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON AGREES
ON ONE THING AND THAT IS HOW

301
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,643
AMAZING ZEKE WAS IN THE MOMENT.

302
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:59,028
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ZEKE, I KNOW-- I KNOW THIS

303
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:04,867
ISN'T-- EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE BEING
CELEBRATED, IT'S NOT SOMETHING

304
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,035
YOU CELEBRATE.

305
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,871
BUT TAKE US BACK TO THAT MOMENT
JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS

306
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,541
HAPPENING FOR YOU EMOTIONALLY AS
IT WAS UNFOLDING.

307
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,753
>> RIGHT, WELL I WAS REALLY
SCARED.

308
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,005
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN TO MY WORLD.

309
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,883
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE REACTION
WAS GOING TO BE.

310
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,011
AND YOU'RE GROWING UP IN
OKLAHOMA, I DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE A

311
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,221
LOT OF FRIENDS.

312
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,057
AND EVEN THROUGHOUT MY LIVES,
PEOPLE HAVEN'T ALWAYS STUCK BY

313
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,226
MY SIDE THROUGH THE HARD TIMES.

314
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,020
BUT WHAT THIS EXPERIENCE HAS
SHOWN ME IS I HAVE SO MUCH LOVE

315
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,063
IN MY LIFE.

316
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:40,277
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
MY FRIENDS ARE HERE TONIGHT, AND

317
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,487
THEY WERE WITH ME THAT NIGHT.

318
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,616
AND MY FRIENDS ARE A BIG PART OF
MY FAMILY, AND I DID NOT GET

319
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,742
THROUGH THIS WITHOUT THEM.

320
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,744
>> Jeff: SO YOU WATCHED WITH
THEM AT HOME.

321
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,912
>> YEAH, I DID.

322
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,121
AND I NEVER FELT AS LOVED AS I
DO RIGHT NOW.

323
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,083
>> Jeff: YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE
MOST CHALLENGING MOMENTS FOR ME

324
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,921
WAS TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE
METAMORPHOSIS MOMENT WASN'T

325
00:13:59,004 --> 00:13:59,547
SCRIPTED.

326
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,756
THIS IS AN UNSCRIPTED SHOW.

327
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,428
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN AMAZING
MOMENT FOR YOU TO GRAB THAT WORD

328
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,097
AND PULL IT INTO THE
CONVERSATION.

329
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,975
SO WHAT, IN TERMS OF
METAMORPHOSIS, WHAT HAS THIS

330
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,059
EXPERIENCE-- WHERE ARE YOU NOW
WITH IT?

331
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,104
>> YEAH, WELL, I.

332
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,272
>> -- SO.

333
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,650
WHEN I TRANSITIONED, I WAS HIT
WITH A PRETTY BIG BOWPT OF

334
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,484
DEPRESSION, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE.

335
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,613
AND I-- I ALMOST FAILED OUT OF
HARVARD.

336
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,406
I WAS LIVING AT HOME.

337
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:25,948
I WAS ALONE.

338
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:26,949
I WAS PRETTY HOPELESS.

339
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,286
ASK & I STARTED WATCHING
"SURVIVOR."

340
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,787
AND I BINGED 20 SEASONS.

341
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,955
IT & IT TOOK ME AWAY.

342
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,585
I GOT TO GO ON ADVENTURES WITH
OZZY AND CIRIE AND SANDRA.

343
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,128
AND IT GOT ME THROUGH.

344
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,923
AND SLOWLY I PUT MY LIFE BACK
TOGETHER.

345
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,967
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING MISSING,
A COURAGE AND BOLDNESS.

346
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,802
AND SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME KNEW
I HAD TO GO PLAY "SURVIVOR."

347
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:50,306
AND I FOUND THAT BOLDNESS IN
FIJI, I FOUND IT ON THE BEACHES.

348
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,852
AND IN SO MANY WAYS "SURVIVOR"
HAS GIVEN ME MY LIFE BACK.

349
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,980
>> Jeff: SARA, AT LEAST FOR
ME, WHEN I WAS WATCHING IT, THE

350
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,650
OTHER NECESSARY HALF OF THE
EQUATION FOR CHANGE TO HAPPEN IS

351
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,029
WHAT YOU SAID WHICH IS, "HERE I
AM, SOMEBODY TRISTATE MIDWEST,

352
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:12,036
NOT EXPOSED TO THIS, ANDS I SEE
YOU AS ZEKE, AND I LOVE YOU AS

353
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,245
ZEKE."

354
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,206
WHAT WAS THE REACTION TO YOUR
FRIENDS WHEN THEY SAW HOW YOU

355
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,416
HAD HANDLED IT?

356
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,503
>> SO I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS HOW
MY STATE WOULD REACT TO IT.

357
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,548
AND EVERYBODY'S BEEN SO
POSITIVE.

358
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,010
AND, YOU KNOW, I TALKED TO MY
DAD ABOUT IT, BEFORE THE SHOW

359
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,178
HAPPENED.

360
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,348
AND HE WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M
SO PROUD OF THE WAY THAT YOU

361
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,515
HANDLED IT."

362
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,060
AND THEN MY GRSMS THE ONE THAT I
WAS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT.

363
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,355
AND WHEN WE GOT OUT HERE, WELL,
FIRST OF ALL,.

364
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,025
>> WHEN VOTED ZEKE OUT, SHE
SCOLDED ME FOR IT.

365
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,194
SHE SAYS, "HE GAVE YOU HIS
JACKET!"

366
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,198
AND I'M LIKE, "I KNOW, BUT" --
>> SO THEY WERE ACCEPTING.

367
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,449
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

368
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:55,037
AND WHEN SHE GOT OUT HERE, HE
WAS THE ONE PERSON SHE WANTED TO

369
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,414
MEET AND SHE GOT TO MEET HIM
YESTERDAY.

370
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,040
>> Jeff: OH, GOOD.

371
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,041
OH, NICE.

372
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,209
WELL, ZEKE, SINCE THEN.

373
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,171
MAN YOUR WORLD-- YOU HAVE BEEN
WRITING-- ONE THING YOU HAVE

374
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:04,713
BEEN WRITING A LOT FOR THE
"HOLLYWOOD REPORTER."

375
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,173
>> YES, I LOVE TO WRITE.

376
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:13,097
THERE'S A GREAT TEAM AT THE
"HOLLYWOOD REPORTER."

377
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,224
IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE AND I'M SO
GRATEFUL FOR THE PLATFORM

378
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,350
THEY'VE GIVEN ME.

379
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,727
>> Jeff: AND YOU'RE WORKING
WITH ANOTHER PLATFORM, GLAD.

380
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:23,190
>> YES, I PARTNERED WITH GLAD,
PARTICULARLY NICK ADAMS OF THE

381
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,734
DIRECTOR OF THE TRANSGENDER
MEDIA PROGRAM.

382
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:33,575
AT THE CORE OF GLAD'S PHILOSOPHY
IS AUTHENTIC L.G.B.T.Q.

383
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,577
REPRESENTATION ACCELERATES
ACCEPTANCE AND SAVES LIVES AND

384
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,080
THAT'S WHY I'M SO PROUD TO BE
PART OF "SURVIVOR" AND CBS

385
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,250
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS
EMPOWERED ME TO SPEAK

386
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,502
AUTHENTICALLY AND TO TELL MY
STORY ON MY OWN TERMS.

387
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:47,923
AND I FEEL LIKURE PARTNERSHIP IS
THE MODEL FOR HOW TRANS STORIES

388
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:51,093
SHOULD BE APPROACHED IN WANT
MEDIA GOING FORWARD.

389
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:51,802
>> Jeff: VERY COOL.

390
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,095
THANK YOU.

391
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,265
YOU KNOW, I LOVED THAT-- BECAUSE
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT FOR YOU THAT

392
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,477
THERE'S THIS PRESSURE OF
EXPECTATION WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE

393
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,438
TAKING CARE OF AND YOU'RE DOING
YOUR PART.

394
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,859
BUT I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT
YOU'RE ALSO USING THIS-- BECAUSE

395
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,986
YOU'RE A GREAT STORYTELLER.

396
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,613
YOU'RE COMPELLING-- THAT'S WHY
WE PUT YOU ON THE SHOW.

397
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,242
SO I'M GLAD YOU ARE GIVING
YOURSELF PERMISSION TO PURSUE

398
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,244
YOUR OWN PERSONAL DREAMS AND NOT
FEEL LIMITED TO HAVING TO TALK

399
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,412
ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME.

400
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,123
SO IF THIS IS A PERFECT WORLD,
BEFORE WE GET TO JEFF, IN A

401
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,834
PERFECT WORLD, WHAT COMES FROM
THIS?

402
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,254
>> WELL, I THINK FOR ME, I FELT
THAT I WAS SOMEHOW LIMITED

403
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,298
BECAUSE I WAS TRANS.

404
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,759
THAT THERE WERE THINGS THEY
COULDN'T DO.

405
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,177
AND I DON'T BE THAT ANYMORE.

406
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,386
SO THAT SHATTERED THAT FOR ME.

407
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,015
THERE WERE DREAMS THEY BURIED
THAT I THINK ARE ALIVE AGAIN.

408
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:43,103
AND I ALSO DON'T WANT ANY YOUNG
TRANS PERSON TO BELIEVE THEY ARE

409
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,229
IN ANY WAY LIMITED.

410
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,231
AND IN THE MEANTIME, THE JOURNEY
MIGHT BE HARDER, BUT THE

411
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,608
ADVENTURE IS SO WORTH TAKING.

412
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,860
>> Jeff: AWESOME, GREAT, I
LOVE THAT.

413
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:56,158
SO THE OTHER PERSON IN THIS
CULTURAL MOMENT WAS JEFF VARNER,

414
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,328
WHO TOOK A LOT OF HEAT,
DESERVEDLY SO.

415
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,956
BUT SINCE THE EPISODE, JEFF, YOU
HAVE BEEN REALLY PUBLIC IN

416
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,166
OWNING YOUR MISTAKE.

417
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,462
YOU MADE A POST ON YOUR FACEBOOK
PAGE, I THINK WHERE YOU TALKED

418
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,421
ABOUT IT.

419
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,298
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE REACTION
WAS THAT NIGHT.

420
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,885
I'M CURIOUS, WHAT HAS THE
REACTION MEANT TO YOU SINCE

421
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,054
PEOPLE HAVE SEEN YOU SAYING, "I
AM SORRY.

422
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,347
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT."

423
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,890
HOW ARE THEY RECEIVING YOU?

424
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,518
>> WELL, THIS HAS BEEN A VERY
DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR BOTH OF

425
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,355
US, AND I DON'T EVER WANT TO
TALK ABOUT MY JOURNEY WITHOUT

426
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,192
ACKNOWLEDGING THE IN FACT THAT
THE REAL JOURNEY IN THIS

427
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,027
SITUATION HAS BEEN FOR ZEKE.

428
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,444
THIS HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT.

429
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,696
I GOT HIT HARD.

430
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,948
WE KNEE WE WOULD.

431
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:40,661
YOU TOLD ME I WOULD, "PREPARE
YOURSELF" AND IT WAS REALLY UGLY

432
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,537
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

433
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,704
AND THEN IT CHANGED.

434
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,374
AND I WAS TOLD THE WAY THEY
REACTED AND THE WAY I HANDLED

435
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,210
IT-- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TAUGHT TO
STAND UP AND ADMIT YOUR MISTAKES

436
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,213
AND OWN THEM AND TURN THEM INTO
SOMETHING POSITIVE, AND I DID

437
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,508
THAT EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY.

438
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,217
AND--
( APPLAUSE )

439
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,093
I'VE HEARD THAT FROM EVERYBODY.

440
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,055
AND I'M --
>> SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?

441
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,059
>> AS MUCH AS HE IS HAPPY ABOUT
THE LOVE IN HIS LIFE, I AM

442
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,604
THRILLED WITH THE SUPPORT IN
MINE, AND IT WILL ULTIMATELY BE

443
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,856
A GOOD THING.

444
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,608
I GOT FIRED, COWARDLY.

445
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,070
BUT KELLER WILLIAMS, THE NUMBER
ONE REAL ESTATE AGENCY IN THE

446
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,698
COUNTRY HIRED ME AND I'M SO
PROUD OF THEM.

447
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,740
BUSINESS HAS BEEN GREAT.

448
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:23,537
>> I LOVE THAT, JEFF, WELL
HANDLED.

449
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,621
>> Jeff: WELL, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.

450
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,208
IT WAS-- IT WAS VERY HARD
TRANSITION TO MAKE THIS ONE

451
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,378
BECAUSE THAT WAS POWERFUL AND
AMAZING.

452
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,255
THIS WAS TINY BUT INTERESTING.

453
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,256
IT WAS A LITTLE MOMENT.

454
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,425
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT IN LAST
WEEK'S EPISODE.

455
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,509
TAKE A LOOK.

456
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:43,098
>> THIS IS A "SURVIVOR" CLASSIC,
LAST WON BY COCHRAN.

457
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,308
SET A RECORD.

458
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,435
17 MINUTES.

459
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,477
>> MY BOYFRIEND.

460
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,729
>> Jeff: GOT A LITTLE CRUSH.

461
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,274
THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A
LITTLE "SURVIVOR" LOVE AFFAIR.

462
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,776
BREAK THIS RECORD, YOU MIGHT WIN
HIS HEART.

463
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,614
COULD WE HAVE A NEW "SURVIVOR"
COUPLE?

464
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:05,245
PLUS, SHE RUBBED A LOT OF PEOPLE
THE WRONG WAY, MICHAELA DID.

465
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,289
SHOULD SHE IMMATURE OR JUST
MISUNDERSTOOD.

466
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,292
SHE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES,
MICHAELA.

467
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:10,792
NEXT.

468
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,668
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

469
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,461
I'LL CIRCLE BACK.

470
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,603
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO THE

471
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,315
"SURVIVOR" LIVE REUNION SHOW FOR
"GAME CHANGERS."

472
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,692
AUBRY, THIS ISN'T A BIG THING
BUT YOU BROUGHT IT UP.

473
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,485
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

474
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,153
YOU WERE TWEETING ABOUT COCHRAN.

475
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:42,366
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND,
BUT IS THIS-- WHAT IS THIS, A TV

476
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:42,783
CRUSH?

477
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,992
WHAT IS THIS?

478
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,287
>> I WAS CRESTFALLEN WHEN DEBBIE
GOES AND STEALS MY MINE, BUT

479
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,830
EVERYONE HAS A CRUSH ON COCHRAN.

480
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,831
LIKE, WHO DOESN'T?

481
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,582
YOU DO.

482
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,126
>> Jeff: I HAVE A COCHRAN
CRUSH.

483
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,669
THAT'S TRUE.

484
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,544
FAIR ENOUGH.

485
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,380
WHERE'S SANDRA.

486
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,506
SANDRA.

487
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:02,344
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THIS GAME, IT SEEMS SO EASY FOR

488
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,512
YOU.

489
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,139
IT'S REALLY JUST A SIMPLE
QUESTION-- IS IT AS EASY AS IT

490
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:06,640
APPEARS?

491
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,766
>> IT'S A JOB TO ME.

492
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,687
I HAVE 39 DAYS TO GO GET MY
MILLION DOLLARS, AND I'LL DO

493
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,232
WHATEVER TO WHOEVER TO GET TO
THE END.

494
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,858
THAT'S MY JOB.

495
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:22,030
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jeff: MICHAELA, WHAT

496
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,740
ADVICE-- I WATCHED YOU PLAY
TWICE.

497
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,033
I LOVE YOU.

498
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,745
I KNOW HOW CARING AND EMPOWERING
ARE YOU ABOUT-- ALL THESE THINGS

499
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,539
THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING,
"MICHAELA?

500
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,500
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MICHAELA?"
WATCHING YOURSELF NOW BACK TO

501
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,044
BACK, WHAT ADVICE DO YOU GIVE TO
MICHAELA?

502
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,215
>> MY ADVICE TO ME IS RECOGNIZE
THAT THE OUTPLAY PART OF THE

503
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,676
GAME IS NOT JUST A PHYSICAL
THING.

504
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,055
IT'S ABOUT RESPONDING TO THE
SITUATION YOU'RE PUT IN, IN THIS

505
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,559
GAME, AND LEARNING HOW TO DO IT
WITH GRACE, WITH STYLE, WITH

506
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,562
FINESSE, WHEN YOU NEED TO, AND
IN YOUR FACE WHEN YOU NEED TO,

507
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,355
BUT WITHOUT ISOLATING YOURSELF.

508
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,899
>> Jeff: DID YOU FIND THAT
MILLION DOLLAR-- YOU WERE SO

509
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,862
BLINDED BY RAGE, LITERALLY, AS A
METAPHOR, YOU DIDN'T SEE A

510
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,654
MILLION-DOLLAR OPPORTUNITY.

511
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,407
>> I'M CHECKING THE STUMP RIGHT
NOW.

512
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,454
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jeff: SIERRA, QUESTION-- I

513
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,955
GOT THIS QUESTION A LOT.

514
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,707
I HAVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS FOR
YOU.

515
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,708
>> OKAY.

516
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,585
>> Jeff: WE'RE LIEFG, WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

517
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,588
BUT WHY-- LIKE, YOU TELL SARAH,
"I HAVE A LEGACY ADVANTAGE."

518
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,300
AND EVERYBODY GOES, "WHY DID YOU
TELL HER!"

519
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,594
WHY DO YOU GUYS FEEL THE NEED AT
TIMES TO SHARE THE MOST

520
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,471
IMPORTANT THING IN THE GAME,
INFORMATION?

521
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,638
>> RIGHT.

522
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,768
I AT THAT POINT MADE THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE YOU COULD MAKE IN

523
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,435
"SURVIVOR" WITH MY HEART.

524
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,978
I WAS SITTING WITH HER.

525
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,396
I WAS BEING HONEST WITH HER.

526
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,647
I WAS BEING VULNERABLE WITH HER.

527
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:43,612
I HAD JUST SEEN MY FATHER, AND I
WAS IN A WEIRD PLACE AND THOUGHT

528
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,947
I COULD BE HONEST WITH SOMEBODY
WAS ALIGNED WITH.

529
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,449
>> Jeff: IT'S ULTIMATELY
TRUST.

530
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,117
>> I TRUST HER 100%.

531
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,286
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, WHEN YOU
COME OUT AND DO EVERYTHING YOU

532
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:55,791
HAVE TO DO TO GET INTO THIS GAME
AND YOU'RE BLINDSIDED IN A CRAZY

533
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,251

TO RECOVER FROM THAT?

534
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,629

535
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,463
NO, WE'VE ALL DONE THIS BEFORE.

536
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,591
WE KNOW HOW UNPREDICTABLE IT CAN
BE.

537
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:08,136
ALL THE WINNERS ARE SITTING IN
THE BACK ROW THIS SEASON.

538
