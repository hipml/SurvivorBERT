1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:03,253
- Previously on<i> Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,921
Lex embarked
on a witch-hunt

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,590
to find out who voted
against him at Tribal Council.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,259
- I will not live
with a snake.

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,928
I will cut the head off of
whoever it is that did this.

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,974
- It was me and I want to keep
quiet for a while longer.

7
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,600
- Ethan won
the reward challenge

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,310
and chose Lex to join
him on an excursion

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,105
to barter goats
for food and gifts.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,942
- As a life experience,
it was a day I will never,

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,486
ever, forget
for the rest of my life.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,780
- Back at camp,
Lex condemned Kelly

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,407
for a vote she
never cast.

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,659
- There is absolutely
no doubt in my mind now.

15
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,744
- That she's the rat?

16
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,246
- Kelly tried to save
herself by joining forces

17
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,330
with the ex-members
of Samburu--

18
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,292
Teresa, Frank,
Kim and Brandon.

19
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,629
- I feel like my only real
strategy is to try to defect.

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,464
- But at Tribal Council,

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,133
Brandon turned
on the ex-Samburus

22
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,469
and joined Lex to
vote off Kelly.

23
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,888
Kelly.

24
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,808
Eight are left.

25
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,269
Who will be the next to go?

26
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:05,607
(singing
in native language)

27
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:13,615
â™ªâ™ª

28
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,220
(rooster crowing)

29
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:27,897
- The mood in camp
this morning is pretty grim.

30
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:34,404
We had an emotion-packed
Tribal Council last night.

31
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,072
The mood is heavy.

32
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:40,201
There's definitely two kind of
divisions here, you know--

33
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:44,080
people that voted for Lex;
people that voted for Kelly;

34
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,083
and we're waiting for
the smoke and ash to settle

35
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,960
before we can figure out
kind of what's going on.

36
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,587
But the biggest issue in
the game right now is--

37
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,422
is trust and
who do you trust,

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,592
and who do you
believe, and, you know,

39
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,260
that's,
that's kind of the--

40
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,428
when you think about it
in life,

41
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,762
that's
kind of the foundation

42
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,265
that you
base everything on.

43
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,777
- I'm going to be
honest with you.

44
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,905
I don't really trust Brandon.

45
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,991
If he's willing to turn like
that on those people

46
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,160
and on Kim
and on his friends,

47
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,953
then there's
no reason...

48
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,413
- That's what they say.
That's what they say.

49
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,665
- It was so shocking to me

50
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,460
because I've trusted Brandon
for 24 straight days.

51
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,378
He's been my friend,
so I thought.

52
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,632
And I thought what
he said was, you know,

53
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,885
going to be true, and, I'm
really burnt up today for sure.

54
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,303
I mean,
I can't understand it.

55
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:45,308
I was set up by somebody
I thought was my friend.

56
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,977
- Yeah.

57
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,064
- Lex has made a bond--

58
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,441
a supposedly strong bond--
with Brandon.

59
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,985
- I mean, let's say
you get immunity.

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,988
He has no loyalty to me.
He has no loyalty to Tom.

61
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,158
He has no loyalty to Kim.
He only has loyalty to you.

62
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,493
- Brandon saved our skin.

63
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,328
- I know, but...

64
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,622
- And I-I-I can't, I won't
forget that.

65
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,666
And if I think that--
if I think that there is,

66
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,168
that-- that both Brandon
and Frank are sure bets

67
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,336
to vote for each other,

68
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,462
I'll go for the guy
that did me a favor,

69
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,506
not for the guy that's been
trying to screw me.

70
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,801
Last night we had to do
something to save our ass.

71
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,803
Kelly was not going to
be the one to do that.

72
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,137
Someone had to act.

73
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,097
I acted and I'm
regretting it now.

74
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,431
- I know you don't want
that responsibility.

75
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,724
- I do not want to make
that decision anymore.

76
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,393
It's a position I didn't ask
for in the first place,

77
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,019
and I've been put in it
and I don't like it.

78
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,062
- I know.

79
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,814
- There's nothing but doubt
and lack of trust,

80
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,482
and you guys need to help me
figure this one out.

81
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,859
I'm not going to
do it by myself.

82
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,238
- Now the major issue
here is,

83
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,824
Lex is 100% confident
in Brandon.

84
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,494
However, I'm not 100% and Tom
isn't 100% convinced

85
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,455
that Brandon will be loyal
to us till the end.

86
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,878
- I sit here
waiting on these women,

87
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,046
the same, all the time.

88
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,507
No matter if you're in Africa,
in Virginia, New York,

89
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,551
you still
got to wait on them.

90
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,428
- It's a good thing there
isn't a mirror around

91
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,013
or it would be
twice the wait.

92
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,389
- Right, and how many
we got in there?

93
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,725
- Three?
- Too many.

94
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,437
- We got three damn women and
it's-- it's still 30 minutes.

95
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,731
Here we are in Africa,
ain't got a damn thing,

96
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
there ain't
nothing to do in there.

97
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,093
- This morning things were
a little bit tense.

98
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,221
I went against my group last
night and I voted Kelly off,

99
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,433
and so the old
Samburu tribe

100
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,603
is not
very happy with me.

101
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,937
I wasn't going to
align myself with Frank.

102
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,272
That wasn't
going to happen

103
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,440
and they should have
known better than that.

104
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,276
So, that's pretty much
my main motivation.

105
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,154
I'd rather be out of here,
you know, in three days,

106
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,323
than to--
for anybody back home to say

107
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,866
that I had aligned
with Frank in any way.

108
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,579
- Frank just decided I'm going
to be a jerk about this thing

109
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,456
and that set the tone for
probably the next three days.

110
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,334
He approached me a few
days ago and asked me

111
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,460
to make an alliance
with him, and I said,

112
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,795
"You know, I've got my
alliances already set.

113
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,130
I don't feel comfortable making
an agreement with you."

114
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,465
I mean, I was fully
straight up with him,

115
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,133
and he's probably
pissed off about the fact

116
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,260
that I made some sort of
agreement with Brandon,

117
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,137
who happens to be
public enemy #1 to Frank.

118
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,473
At this point now, I feel
it's his time to go

119
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,433
because I'm
having a hard time

120
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,351
dealing with
that guy anymore.

121
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,312
The guy has just become
a pain in my butt,

122
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,480
and just having him
around brings morale down.

123
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,525
The guy's always
in a sour mood.

124
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,360
It's just not good
for tribe morale

125
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,486
and I'm ready to get rid
of him.

126
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,118
(flies buzzing)

127
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,413
- The flies are terrible.
- I know, they're awful.

128
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,222
- The flies are
so rampant and so brazen.

129
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,516
You're waving your hand
and touching them

130
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,519
and they still
stay there.

131
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,645
At home, you have
one fly in the kitchen

132
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,564
and you go ballistic.

133
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,403
I feel like the baboons.

134
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,696
You're like picking,
picking, picking.

135
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,781
When we go back home,

136
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,367
we'll probably look
like nervous wrecks,

137
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,494
just picking at
ourselves all the time.

138
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,662
Between
picking at the insects

139
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,165
and picking at the scabs,
we'll be...

140
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,503
- Don't.

141
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,214
- Tom's got a massive boil,

142
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,133
and I just can't stop
looking at that thing.

143
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,217
- I feel...

144
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:53,890
- It's like third eye,
extra brain, I don't know.

145
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,558
I can't
look him in the eyes.

146
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,058
I'm like looking at
the side of his neck.

147
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:56,851
I mean, it's big.

148
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,562
I've never seen a boil
that big.

149
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,565
- I have seen all these animals
out here in Africa,

150
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,942
and most of the animals
that are fit and strong

151
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,903
usually has a horn.

152
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,531
Take the rhino,
the antelope.

153
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,743
So, I'm growing a horn to fight
off the beast that comes,

154
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,413
and mainly it's coming
from inside the camp.

155
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,081
- All right, Big Tom.

156
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,042
That boil
is making him crazy.

157
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,710
- Misery loves company.

158
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,088
When you got
something like this,

159
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,965
they just can't keep their
hands off of it.

160
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,595
- Two weeks ago he had one
under his arm.

161
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,264
He squeezed it
and it hurt real bad

162
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,100
and it just popped,
and oh, my goodness.

163
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:43,105
- Oh, oh!

164
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,233
- Tons of stuff seeped out.

165
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,276
It would have
filled up a shotglass.

166
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,451
- Oh, my golly gee.

167
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,702
- I think it's too deep.
- Yep.

168
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,748
- The women like to squeeze
and cause pain to men,

169
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,667
and that's one way they can
get back at you.

170
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,253
Some things you want
them to touch, they won't.

171
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,921
Some things you don't want them
to touch, they will.

172
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,673
That's your typical beast.

173
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,883
(laughter)

174
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,969
- Two little...
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,014
- Two little peoples.
- Two little people.

176
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,724
- Aren't they adorable?
You ready?

177
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,477
- Totally.

178
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,483
- "You'll need strength and
agility, and brains to contend.

179
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,319
You can't do it alone, so you
each choose a friend.

180
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,655
The reward is for two,
an evening's getaway,

181
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,866
so pair up and prepare to
outwit, outlast and outplay.

182
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,869
- So it's pairs and there's
eight of us.

183
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,996
- I don't know what
the fairest way to do it is.

184
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,124
- I think if we start
choosing up, it's going to be...

185
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,792
- It's going to get
uglier than it already is.

186
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,961
- Yeah, it's going to be
difficult, I think. You know?

187
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,546
- We'd kill each other
before we get to the...

188
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,464
- Well, we could put eight
numbers in a hat.

189
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,717
- Two ones, two twos,
two threes, two fours.

190
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,846
- Who's got number four?
- Holding number one.

191
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,850
- Yeah.
- Two.

192
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,854
- Three.
- Big Bear and little bear.

193
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,523
- Lex and I are a team.
- That's good.

194
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,066
- Who are you?
- Big bear.

195
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,320
- Big bear.
- And Brandon and Frank.

196
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:17,867
- Let the games begin.
- Let the games begin.

197
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,370
(laughter)

198
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,372
- Believe me, I did
not pick Brandon.

199
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,874
Brandon would be the last
person on Earth I would pick.

200
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,711
I cringed because I saw
everyone pairing up,

201
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,506
and big old Tom got a big
bellyful on this one, you know?

202
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,717
- I better
get away from you.

203
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,720
- Frank is, man...

204
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,849
His disposition is about 80
years old, set in his ways.

205
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,894
And for them two to get together
and get that reward...

206
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,898
I swear, if I was playing
a dirty trick on them,

207
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,734
I couldn't have thought of a
better thing to do to Frank.

208
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,486
- It was so funny.

209
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,737
Of all people, Frank and I
partnered up.

210
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,906
I mean, we are polar opposites
of each other.

211
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,033
We could live
next door to each other

212
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,701
and never say words to
each other

213
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,911
because our lives
are so very different.

214
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,914
- Me and Kim Powers were
partners,

215
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,540
and really
it's the first time

216
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,584
we've ever been so together
in anything.

217
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,919
Everybody's kept us apart.

218
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,878
Look at us!

219
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,589
Yeah, look at us.

220
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,424
If it's physical,
we're going to win,

221
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,718
but if it's anything
mental, we're screwed.

222
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,428
- Come on, now.
Follow my lead.

223
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,680
Let's go.

224
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,852
- Tom's going to get
injured tonight.

225
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,978
- You can tell yourself it's
just a game a million times,

226
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,273
but it's hard for me to
differentiate

227
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,567
between playing
the game very strategically

228
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,070
versus playing the game and
bonding with people

229
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,780
and building relationships.

230
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,448
We are so...
We are so...

231
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,449
- We bad.

232
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,450
- We need a team name--
come on.

233
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,284
Team name, team name,
um...

234
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,286
- Big and little.
- Big and little?

235
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,955
Big and little, yeah.
Yeah.

236
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,581
We're big and little.
- You're little. You little.

237
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,792
- Big Tom is just such
a good, good person,

238
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,253
and I was totally excited
to be paired up with him,

239
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,587
plus he's big and strong,

240
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,464
so we figure
we might have a chance.

241
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,590
- Big game here.

242
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,968
Frank, listen--
you and Brandon,

243
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,973
you are a team,
you are as one.

244
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,976
- It's just funny seeing people
that are matched up.

245
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,521
Everyone's got a partner now
and everyone's happy.

246
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,357
And boy, the thing
with my partner,

247
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:13,816
my camping trip just
went to hell.

248
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,942
That's all.

249
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,785
- Okay.

250
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,995
For today's reward challenge,
we've assembled

251
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,666
a good old-fashioned
<i>Survivor</i> obstacle course.

252
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,169
You'll start by making
your way over the cargo net

253
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,795
and across
the timber tumble.

254
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,172
You'll then
go up the rope climb

255
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,340
by using either the rope
or the rope ladder

256
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,341
and ring the bell.

257
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,677
Next stage is
the belly crawl.

258
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,138
You'll then go over
a series of three walls.

259
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,723
That will bring you
to a ladder.

260
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,891
You're going to assemble the
ladder and use that

261
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,685
to get over
the final 10-foot wall.

262
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,854
First team finished wins.

263
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,690
The winning team will leave
camp, be under the African sky,

264
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,524
and you'll have your own

265
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,611
private, outdoor movie
experience,

266
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,654
complete with
popcorn, candy, hot dogs,

267
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,990
and all the Mountain Dew
you can drink.

268
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,909
We've randomly selected in what
order you're going to run.

269
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,622
Brandon and Frank, you're up
first against Tom and Kim.

270
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,541
Here we go, guys.
This is heat one.

271
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,835
Winners move onto the next
round.

272
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,046
Survivors ready?
Go!

273
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,887
- Hold up, Brandon.

274
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,516
No, no, no.

275
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,517
Now you're good.
Now you're good.

276
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,019
Go, go, go.

277
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,062
(bell clanging)

278
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,022
- Come on, boy.

279
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,239
- It's a tight race.

280
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,532
You guys are dead even.

281
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,868
- (coughing)

282
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,953
- You can go to the ladder,

283
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,789
but don't start working
on it without your teammate.

284
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,252
If it's not fitting,
it ain't working.

285
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,254
- This does.
This has to fit there.

286
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,463
That's the only place.

287
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,049
- The square right here
and right there.

288
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,300
- That's good.
Get the next one.

289
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,136
Move your foot.
- It's got to flip-flop.

290
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,972
- It looks like Brandon
and...

291
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,933
They're up.
It's theirs.

292
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,184
- Son of a bitch!

293
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,688
- Yeah!

294
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,235
- Brandon and Frank win
the first heat.

295
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,612
Moving on to the finals, guys.
Take a rest.

296
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,947
Here we go: heat two.

297
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,200
Ethan and Kim, you're up
against Lex and Teresa.

298
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,660
Winners move on
to the finals.

299
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,580
Survivors, ready?
Go!

300
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,135
- You're doing great,
T-bird.

301
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,763
- Go, T-bird.

302
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,730
- Get that foot down.
Get that foot down.

303
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,320
- You can't start on
the ladder without her, though.

304
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,779
- Take your time.

305
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,615
- You want to use all your
pieces.

306
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,459
- Last one.

307
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,629
- Ethan and Kim, moving on
to the finals.

308
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,714
All right, this is
the final heat.

309
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,675
Winners are going to
the movies,<i> Survivor</i> style.

310
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,970
Survivors ready!
Go!

311
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
- Go, Frank, go!
- Go.

312
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,690
- Come on, dude, let's go.

313
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,655
- Go! Down!

314
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,913
Come on, Frank.
Go!

315
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,748
(rings bell)

316
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,791
Go!

317
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,928
- Combination of square round.
Square, round.

318
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,849
- Come on, Frank. Go.

319
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,851
- Go, go, go, Frank!

320
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,449
- Got a date with Frank!
Got a date with Frank.

321
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,910
- Brandon and Frank,
going to the movies.

322
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,135
(overlapping chatter)

323
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,429
- I never thought
I'd see the day

324
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,057
where Brandon would be
Frank's taskmaster!

325
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,934
- Yes.
"Frank, you go"!

326
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:01,270
- Brandon had
a whip on Frank.

327
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,147
- He did.
- "Go, go, go!"

328
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,274
- And he was so damn weak he
could hardly move.

329
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,358
- I'm like standing there
in total shock,

330
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,152
going, "Oh, my,
oh, my."

331
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,821
- I wonder if they're going to
get hot dogs and hamburgers.

332
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,948
- Hot dogs, nachos.
- Nachos.

333
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,243
- All right,
this is your Mecca.

334
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,287
Here's your setup.

335
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,664
You've got your own
35-millimeter projector

336
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,668
with a movie that happens
to be<i> Out of Africa.</i>

337
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,961
- Of course.

338
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,797
- Behind you, couple of
chairs, and of course...

339
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,758
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

340
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,802
- Yep, hot dogs,
some chips.

341
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,512
Gorge, feast,
do whatever you want.

342
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,431
When the sun comes down,
we'll start the movie.

343
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,272
- This is tough.
This is tough.

344
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,983
I just feel guilty as hell
eating it.

345
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,110
- Yeah, me too.
Can't you tell?

346
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,488
- He assumed his position
well, I thought.

347
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,156
- I think it's the beginning
of something really big

348
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,325
and permanent with
those two, I really do.

349
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,828
- A night to remember-- I hope
it's a good moonlit night.

350
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,332
The key to success on this one
with Frank and Brandon

351
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,501
is working together
closely.

352
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,628
Hands-on participation.
- Yes.

353
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,546
- They definitely found their
rhythm together.

354
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,006
There's no doubt that...

355
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:14,301
- They did find it.
- Harmony.

356
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,011
- Mmm.

357
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,558
- I can hear them back there
cracking the whip on him!

358
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,810
And it worked.

359
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,894
- And if you go to
that movie tonight,

360
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,854
you might hear
that whip again.

361
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,855
(laughter)

362
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,898
- Whoo!

363
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,321
- I'm looking for Frank
to walk home any minute.

364
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,407
They'll drive Brandon home--
Frank will be walking.

365
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,535
- I'm not going.
- I ain't riding with him.

366
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,161
- I'm not watching
this with him.

367
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,872
- This crazy movie, it ain't
even an army movie.

368
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,916
They didn't kill nobody
in this movie.

369
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,368
- To see<i> Out of Africa</i> in
Africa was unbelievable.

370
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,327
Brandon's a competitor,
and yes,

371
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,413
I high-fived him in
the spirit of victory.

372
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,749
It still doesn't mean I'd
go to coffee with him.

373
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,626
As far as sharing
the movie with him

374
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,879
and the reward challenge,
has it really changed my mind?

375
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,880
No, it hasn't.

376
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,882
I'm still old-fashioned,
you know.

377
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,258
Don't even go there.

378
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,259
- Frank is somebody
that in my real life

379
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,553
I would never be
around.

380
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,764
Frank is very abrasive and,
you know, kind of cold,

381
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,308
and he doesn't have
that kind of warm side

382
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:50,981
to offset his, um...
less-than-charming personality.

383
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,607
- I take the cards that I'm
dealt with

384
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,400
and make the best of them.

385
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,485
It was difficult enough
for me personally,

386
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,778
but, hey, it's a movie.

387
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,447
Be quiet
and watch the damn movie.

388
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,948
Yeah, the company could have
been better,

389
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,658
but we simply had popcorn.

390
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,285
We had pop.
We watched a movie.

391
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,286
It's history.
It's over with.

392
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,287
Let's move forward.

393
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,645
- Quit eating
all the white ones.

394
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,146
- Are there really no more?

395
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,648
- Nope, they're all gone.
You ate them all.

396
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,900
- Liar, I saw you eat some.

397
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,669
- Where does Brandon
fit in now?

398
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,962
That's what's become very
complicated.

399
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,881
Because Brandon
helped save our skins.

400
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,008
Brandon did us a favor.

401
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,636
However, Tom and Ethan
are not in agreement.

402
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,720
They still
don't trust him

403
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,180
and they're actually
talking about

404
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,182
wanting to vote
Brandon out next,

405
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,350
which I have a hard time
understanding.

406
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,478
I don't think I'm going
to be able to do that.

407
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,021
This is one situation

408
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,898
where I may have to vote
outside my fray.

409
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,484
- I'm debating, you know,
is your word just your word

410
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,362
or does your word have
a different level of words?

411
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,823
Like, is your word
with Brandon

412
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,700
just as important
as your word with us?

413
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,869
- No, it's-- I mean, my word
with you guys

414
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,371
goes to the end of
the game.

415
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,915
- So when does your word
with Brandon go?

416
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:36,461
- I guess, if Brandon--
you guys get rid of Brandon.

417
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,390
- Well, Jungle Jim, did you
see anything out there?

418
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:54,229
- Just a few gazelles there
snorting at me.

419
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,398
- How you feeling today?

420
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,526
- The big boy has been
smelling a little rat.

421
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:04,197
How did Lex and Brandon
get so tight all of a sudden?

422
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,576
- I give you
my word of honor:

423
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,454
Brandon is going down
before you.

424
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,955
- I heard you.

425
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,750
But see, since Lex said no,
I've got to go

426
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,920
across tribal boundaries
and get me more votes.

427
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,758
- I'm presuming you got an ax
to grind with me tomorrow night.

428
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,218
- Yeah.
- That's what I thought.

429
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,179
- Huh?
- That's what I thought.

430
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,972
- I like Tom.
Tom reminds me of back home.

431
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,599
You know,
only things are slow,

432
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,434
firm-- things get done.

433
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,103
You know, there's no
political correctness.

434
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,438
We're just men of action

435
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,774
and we just do our job
and get it done.

436
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,068
I should have met Tom
from day one, you know?

437
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,611
I'm going down low.

438
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,822
I respect his original
alliance, you know,

439
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,282
with the Boran members,

440
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,993
but I sense he's growing
uneasy with that.

441
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,578
He sees some changes,
obviously,

442
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,706
with Lex's recruitment of
Brandon right next to his side.

443
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,083
You know,
he doesn't like that.

444
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,626
People are
changing their mind

445
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,377
like their changing
their underwear.

446
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,477
- Here's the thing.

447
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,062
The more I thought about it,
the more I thought, you know,

448
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:17,896
I just wanted to
get rid of Kelly

449
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,315
because she was like
double-talking.

450
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,108
- Then you should
have told me.

451
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,068
I would have never
voted for Lex.

452
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,153
- I know, but there was no way
in the line-- I mean,

453
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:25,737
I didn't
know what to say in the line

454
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,697
with them watching us.

455
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,324
- You could have just pulled me
aside for two seconds.

456
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,700
I don't care if
Lex was watching you.

457
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,576
Because you owed it to me
because you were my friend.

458
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,829
- I do owe...
I'm still your friend.

459
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,497
It didn't have anything
to do with that.

460
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,292
Matches.
Something to do with fire.

461
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,002
Well.

462
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,130
Just vote for me
next time or whatever,

463
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,049
because I can't take
hearing you say stuff about me.

464
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,175
You know what I mean?

465
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,301
I don't want to hear that
anymore.

466
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,470
It just... it hurts me.

467
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,805
You're the only person I care
about out here,

468
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,514
so I just--
I can't take that.

469
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,058
You're still my friend,

470
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,185
and you're going to be
my friend forever.

471
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,437
- I appreciate that.

472
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,574
- Okay, you all go ahead
and read it.

473
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,493
It's better for
some of you than others.

474
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,662
- It says, "Earth, wind, and
fire, elements to win this game.

475
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,207
"The object's pretty simple:
be the first to make a flame.

476
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,667
"It's done here every day,
but it may cause some strife,

477
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,752
"and with
Tribal Council pending,

478
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:23,545
fire represents your life."

479
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,757
- Wow. Oh!

480
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,177
- The immunity challenge

481
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,761
feels very important to me,
personally.

482
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:36,183
I mean, I am now in the most
vulnerable position

483
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,060
of anyone in our tribe.

484
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,604
I have the most, as I know--
as far as I know,

485
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,064
I've got the most
votes against me.

486
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,026
So I'm going to do everything
I can to win immunity.

487
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,569
- Depending on who wins
immunity,

488
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,905
it's going to put
a whole spin on this game

489
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,739
and it
will be very interesting

490
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,908
to see who gets voted off
next.

491
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,743
I mean, it could
very well be me.

492
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,245
And a lot of people
want to vote Brandon off.

493
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,457
I know Teresa still thinks we
might be able to vote Lex out.

494
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,751
So it's going to be very
interesting

495
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,502
and whoever wins immunity,

496
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,754
it will be hugely
important this time.

497
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,047
I mean it always is,

498
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,756
but this is like another
really crucial,

499
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,176
crucial move
to win immunity.

500
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,782
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.

501
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,577
- Like falling into
formation.

502
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,787
First things first.
Ethan.

503
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,958
Got to take back
the immunity necklace.

504
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,336
Once again, immunity
back up for grabs.

505
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,130
Well, if there's one thing you
guys had to have learned by now,

506
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,758
it is how important
fire is for survival.

507
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,427
And after 26 days,

508
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,013
all eight of you should know
how to make fire.

509
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,640
Today we're going to find out
who's the best.

510
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,141
Here's how
it's going to work.

511
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,979
On my "go," you'll gather as
much brush, as many sticks,

512
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:04,980
elephant dung,
whatever you want.

513
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,648
Bring it back.
Put it in your fire circle.

514
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,651
Then, using
a magnifying glass,

515
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,319
the bright light of the sun,

516
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,947
you'll attempt to
create fire.

517
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,285
The goal is, get your flame
high enough to light the wick,

518
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,037
which will drop the bag
and raise the flag.

519
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,499
First person to raise
their flag wins immunity,

520
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,294
guarantees himself three
more days in Africa,

521
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,629
and a one-in-seven shot
at a million bucks.

522
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,340
Only one rule:
None of the material you gather

523
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,677
can touch any part of your
structure, including the wick.

524
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,345
Only the flame
can touch your wick.

525
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,681
Anything other than the fire,
you'll be disqualified.

526
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,225
Take your positions.
Wait for my "go."

527
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,769
This is for immunity!

528
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,523
Survivors ready?
Go!

529
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,929
- There you go.

530
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,443
- Come on, Powers.
You can do this, Powers.

531
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,237
Come on.
Come on.

532
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,238
All right.

533
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,198
- Kim and Lex have fire.

534
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,993
Frank has fire.

535
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,459
- Come on, burn!
Burn!

536
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,670
Come on,
burn, burn! Burn!

537
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,672
Burn!

538
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,344
Burn, burn!

539
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,933
- Frank, your branch
touched the string.

540
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,352
I'm sorry.
You're out.

541
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,942
Everybody keep going.
Keep going.

542
00:28:56,025 --> 00:29:00,822
Kim! Keep going.
It's not over. Keep going!

543
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,992
You guys cannot have
anything hit the wick.

544
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,827
- All right,
I understand.

545
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,956
- Keep going.
- Come on, burn!

546
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,876
Come on, burn.
Come on.

547
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,214
- Come on!

548
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,231
- Yes, yes!

549
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,568
- Lex wins immunity.
- Yes!

550
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,362
- Lex was first done.

551
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,365
It was a clean hit--
immunity.

552
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,913
At four votes
at last Tribal Council,

553
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,372
I'm thinking you might
need this.

554
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,373
- I'm thinking
this is good.

555
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,917
- Congratulations.
Nice job.

556
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:28,701
- I've been out here
for 24, 25 days now.

557
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,954
I have a lot invested,
and the longer you're out here,

558
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,039
the more
you want to go all the way.

559
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,457
I mean,
it has a strange way

560
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,584
psychologically of
working out that way.

561
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,379
You just-- it becomes less
and less an option

562
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,756
to take that long
walk out, you know,

563
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,924
out of the game.

564
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,051
You want to stay.
- Sweet siesta.

565
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,136
- That's right.
- Yep.

566
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,057
- Sweet, sweet siesta.

567
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,101
- Next couple days are going
to be really difficult.

568
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,103
We've got... we've got to
make a decision.

569
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,730
Tom, Ethan, Kim and I
have to make a decision

570
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,399
about what we're going to
do at Tribal Council,

571
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,483
and how
we're going to vote.

572
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,776
I've already
indicated to them

573
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,444
that if they decide that
Brandon's the mark,

574
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,779
then I can't vote
that way

575
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,114
and they better be able to
figure out a way

576
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,658
to get extra votes,
or else our coalition,

577
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,952
our alliance
is going to go down,

578
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,912
and they're going to be
able to pick us off one by one.

579
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,964
- You can't let
your personal feelings

580
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,591
get involved here anymore.

581
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,593
I don't care if you like
Frank more than Brandon.

582
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,804
Brandon helped us out
and he may do it again.

583
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,098
- Yeah, but that's
a long shot.

584
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,141
- If he doesn't
make a deal with us,

585
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,517
he's going to
make a deal with them

586
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,102
and then all bets
are off and you're screwed.

587
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,979
Because Frank
will vote for you.

588
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,148
Don't get me wrong:
he's going to vote for you

589
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,525
in a heartbeat
if he thinks he can win.

590
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,987
If he gets Brandon on board,
he's voting for you

591
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,156
and then Brandon is next.

592
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,366
Guaranteed.
Think about that.

593
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,618
Don't take too long

594
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,161
because if you take
too long, you're going.

595
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,329
- Oh, I know.
I know.

596
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,666
Lex has done said he will not
vote against Brandon.

597
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:04,005
So, um... that's fine.

598
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,051
But that, you know...

599
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,177
it's kind of like
going to the dance.

600
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,847
If you dance with my old lady,
I'll dance with yours.

601
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,683
- I know T-bird I can count on
like my own family,

602
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,684
you know what I mean?

603
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,852
- Yeah.

604
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,812
- I've had the same
feeling about you,

605
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,856
and that's why I said
put the three of us together.

606
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,483
I think we could walk
to the top on this.

607
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,860
- Well, I'm telling you, if I
shake your hand on something,

608
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,487
you can count on that.
- I know that.

609
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,741
- If I see you put it out
there, then I'll know.

610
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,369
- I see something
over there, maybe.

611
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,205
See it?
It just went to the right.

612
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,582
That may just be another
gazelle.

613
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,046
If Frank
hates Brandon enough

614
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:49,258
to say he wants
Brandon's gone...

615
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,052
- I know
the way Frank thinks

616
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,261
and Frank wants to get
as far as possible.

617
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,390
- That's the American way.
We all do.

618
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,183
- So he will do anything--

619
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,728
even make friends
with Brandon again

620
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,230
to get further in the game.

621
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,607
He will compromise
whatever it is to make...

622
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,151
- Right, but I still feel safer
getting it done that way

623
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,071
than the other way.

624
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,739
- In trusting Brandon
to vote for Frank?

625
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,032
- Hell, yeah.

626
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,424
- I'm ready for day
after tomorrow.

627
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,426
- From what I've been
able to see,

628
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:36,681
anybody who either tried to
manipulate people, jump ship,

629
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:41,310
come up with a plan B
too soon, got gooned.

630
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,272
These are smart people.

631
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,232
And if they see
the writing on the wall,

632
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,358
that you lack confidence

633
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:51,654
and you're looking to
come up with an ulterior plan,

634
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,157
you shoot yourself
in the foot

635
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,324
with the people
that you have

636
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,786
somewhat of
an original alliance with.

637
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,288
So I've been
pretty steadfast

638
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,999
in trying to keep
with my original alliance.

639
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,667
I really have not
faltered from that,

640
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,794
and for me that's worked.

641
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,629
At least it's
gotten me this far.

642
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,841
- Exactly.

643
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:16,679
- Hey, Big Tom got his self
between a crack and a hard spot.

644
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,514
I'm still going to
hold to my guns,

645
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,602
but after the vote
tonight, if Lex don't help me,

646
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,396
we may not have the tightest
marriage as we once did.

647
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,823
- At Tribal Council
tonight,

648
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,450
we know Kim
is a big question mark.

649
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,202
I know she has a bond
with Brandon.

650
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,829
However, he screwed her over
big time,

651
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,372
so I don't know if she's
resentful.

652
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,166
They said they'd never
vote for each other,

653
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,503
but I can't count on
that 100%.

654
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,172
I know Frank doesn't
love Lex, you know,

655
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:51,964
and they see him
as a leader.

656
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,841
They don't like
the way he leads,

657
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,135
and if they get him off,
you know, they thought,

658
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:56,844
you know,
they'd have a better chance

659
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,846
of getting into
the final four.

660
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,973
They smell the final four--
those guys.

661
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,350
That's the one thing that
makes me a little nervous

662
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,728
about Frank
and about Teresa

663
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,022
is they could be
so close to the final four

664
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,315
if they side with Brandon.

665
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,673
- We'll now bring in
the first member of our jury.

666
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,341
Kelly returns tonight.

667
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,386
Kelly will be with us
for each Tribal Council.

668
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,722
And each week,
one of you will join her.

669
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,183
The jury is always here
only to observe.

670
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,226
You're not to
speak to the jury.

671
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,062
Ultimately, the jury
will have the last say

672
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:49,564
because they will
make the final vote

673
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,399
to determine
who gets the million dollars

674
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,568
and the title
of Survivor.

675
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,736
So before we get to
tonight's vote,

676
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,447
let's talk about the past
few days.

677
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,243
Ethan, can you capture in one
word what this game is about?

678
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,496
What's the overriding quality
that it takes to get this far?

679
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,707
- I'd say confidence.

680
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,251
Confidence in yourself,

681
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,212
confidence in your friends
that you make.

682
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,755
Confidence
in your decisions.

683
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,884
Confidence in winning
the challenges.

684
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,012
- Brandon, do you look
at this in terms of morality

685
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,221
and ethics
or do you look at this

686
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,264
in terms of
"What are the rules

687
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,433
and how far
can I push them?"

688
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,143
- Yeah, you know what?
I do.

689
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:31,397
I wouldn't do anything like
amoral or you know,

690
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,107
disgusting
or anything like that,

691
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,984
but as far as just
playing the game goes,

692
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,069
yeah, it's a game.

693
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,449
I came to have a really good
time, and I have.

694
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,160
- Big Tom,
is this an adventure

695
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,453
that tests your
morality and integrity,

696
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,664
or is this a game that
is about rules

697
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,249
and how can I exploit them?

698
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,461
Morality doesn't play?
- All the above.

699
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,129
You know, you've got to
hold all of them

700
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,422
before you get through
the day,

701
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,465
and you've got to
check yourself,

702
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,593
and then you look in
the eyes of your compadres

703
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,970
and say, "Well, is he

704
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,472
the same kind
of man I came in here with?

705
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,475
How has his value changed?"
Or what?

706
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,392
But I can't dwell
on that much

707
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,645
because whatever will happen
will happen,

708
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,604
and I can't change that,

709
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:15,149
and out here there's other
things to do.

710
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,276
- What is there to do
out here

711
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,987
other than think about
the game?

712
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:24,283
- Well, Lord have mercy.
I've had to watch these women.

713
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,620
I've got responsibilities.
I've got to dance.

714
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,665
I've got to sing.
It's a pretty lively bunch.

715
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,043
- Frank, how big an
issue is trust at this point?

716
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,671
- Trust is a big factor because
it could be the shield

717
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,173
that takes you
all the way up there.

718
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,803
How much there is, it's
hard to tell, you know.

719
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,554
It's very limited in some
respects, you know.

720
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,306
We're a little broken
here or there,

721
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,393
but when you do find it,
it means an awful lot.

722
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,602
- Lex, what do you base
your votes on?

723
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,688
How well you
trust somebody?

724
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,065
- Trust plays
a huge part for me

725
00:37:56,148 --> 00:38:00,027
and probably the single
biggest factor

726
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,487
I take into consideration
when voting is my gut.

727
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,740
It's how I make
decisions in life.

728
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,742
- But your gut out here
is influenced

729
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,162
based on a certain
set of experiences, facts,

730
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,580
assumptions, fair?

731
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,540
- Fair, but my gut still
doesn't lie

732
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,543
and my gut is still
pretty damn accurate.

733
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,211
- Kim, how about you?

734
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:21,090
When you vote for somebody,
is it based strategy--

735
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,550
"Got to get rid of them;
they're too strong;

736
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,176
they could win it,"
or is it, you know what,

737
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,386
"They're just not
nice and I want them to go"?

738
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,597
- I would say
it's the latter.

739
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,058
But I go on "Who am I
comfortable with?

740
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,770
Who will I respect in the
final three, the final two?"

741
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,565
If it's not me,
who do I want to win?

742
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,442
And again,
I'm a little bit like Lex.

743
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,611
I go on a gut feeling
of who I respect

744
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,238
and who
I'm comfortable with.

745
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,615
- Kim, think you've
made any wrong judgments?

746
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,411
- Um, sure, yeah.
I definitely think that.

747
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,497
I think my biggest weakness
is that I build

748
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,501
relationships with
people and trust them.

749
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,088
And, you know, foolishly
think that some of that

750
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,173
is part of the game,

751
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,508
when really the game is
much more about strategy.

752
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,510
And I think my biggest
weakness is being naive.

753
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,888
- Okay,
it's time to vote.

754
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,140
Tom, you're up first.

755
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:42,129
- Frank, you have been
nothing but rude,

756
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,131
grouchy and a poor sport,

757
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,674
and the last few days with
you have been insufferable.

758
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,969
Bottom line: you've
been a real downer,

759
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:49,637
and I can't wait to see
you gone.

760
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,847
Bye-bye.

761
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,500
- I don't even really
know what to say.

762
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,377
It's such a shame
that it came to this.

763
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,711
But I just don't trust you.

764
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,047
I don't know even if
we had a friendship.

765
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,465
I'm not even sure
of that anymore,

766
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,136
but I'm sorry that
it came down to this.

767
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,807
- I'll go tally the votes.

768
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,029
Once the votes have been
counted, the decision is final.

769
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,364
The person will be asked

770
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,032
to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.

771
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,326
I'll read the votes.

772
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,417
First vote: Brandon.

773
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,754
Brandon.

774
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,553
Frank.

775
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,932
Brandon.

776
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,812
Brandon.

777
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,733
Frank.

778
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,904
That's four votes Brandon;
two votes Frank.

779
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,199
The ninth person voted out

780
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,452
for the second member
of our jury: Brandon.

781
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,287
- You guys,
only 12 more days.

782
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,331
Have a lot of fun.

783
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,629
- Brandon, the tribe
has spoken.

784
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,259
It's time for you to go.

785
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,344
- See you, sugar bear.

786
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,194
- Well, with two
members on the jury now,

787
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,612
and a one-in-seven shot
at winning this whole thing,

788
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,614
this game is
getting very tricky.

789
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,865
You guys
can head back to camp.

790
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,992
Good night.

791
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,761
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

792
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,305
- Next time on<i> Survivor...</i>

793
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,139
Lex is in the hot seat.

794
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,141
- All he was worried
about was Lex.

795
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,977
- Now he's got to thinking
about me and you.

796
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,104
- Tom takes up
shower duty.

797
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,981
- Tom gets away with murder.

798
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,649
- Frank shows his
sensitive side.

799
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,442
- These little liberal
special interest groups

800
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,319
that the media
give open market to,

801
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,363
instead of the average
working class American

802
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,614
that founded this
country.

803
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:55,739
- Okay, enough!
All right, enough.

804
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,871
- I cannot believe
I made it 27 days.

805
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,375
I had never gone camping.
Never slept on the ground.

806
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,877
I don't have any hard feelings
for those guys voting me off,

807
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,839
because, honestly,
I stirred up some trouble.

808
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,674
I do regret, however,
that Kim

809
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,467
feels like I somehow
betrayed her.

810
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,844
I think she is
such a great person.

811
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,845
I should be saying,
"Damn, I didn't win."

812
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,973
But you know what?
I feel like I won.
