1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,794
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,212
"SURVIVOR": AT THE UPOLU
TRIBE--

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,339
THERE WAS FIVE OF US SIT, OUT

4
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,550
BY THE CANOE.

5
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,634
Jeff: A RANDOM CONVERSATION

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,638
ON THE FIRST NIGHT TURNED INTO
A

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,808
FINAL FIVE PACT.

8
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,309
LATER, COACH ADDED EDNA TO THE

9
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,519
GROUP AS THE SIXTH.

10
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,271
IT'S MY JOB TO PROTECT HER.

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,982
Jeff: AFTER THE MERGE, WHEN

12
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,608
THE ALLIANCE OF SIX WAS IN

13
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,276
DANGER--

14
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,944
THERE'S A LINE IN THE SAND.

15
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,446
COME ACROSS THAT LINE.

16
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,823
Jeff: COACH PERSUADED

17
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,575
COCHRAN TO FLIP AND JOIN HIS

18
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,284
ALLIANCE AS THEIR SEVENTH.

19
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,286
I GOT COCHRAN ON OUR SIDE TO

20
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,787
PLAY THE REST OF THE THIS GAME.

21
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,122
I CONVINCED HIM HE WILL BE

22
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,623
VALUED AND LOVED OVER HERE.

23
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,332
Jeff: BUT ON DAY 29 WHEN HE

24
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,668
WAS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, COCK

25
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,295
RAN USED ALL THE TRICKS HE

26
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,672
LEARNED AT HARVARD LAW TO MAKE
A

27
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,381
FINAL SUMMATION.

28
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,299
HE SAID I KNOW A LOT OF YOU

29
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,968
FEEL INDEBTEDDED TO ME.

30
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,594
DON'T

31
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,803
FEEL INDEBTEDDED TO YOU.

32
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,429
SCREW YOU.

33
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,305
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

34
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,767
ONCE AGAIN BRANDON PUT HIS

35
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,476
FOOT IN HIS MOUTH.

36
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,769
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS WHAT'S

37
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,478
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THESE TWO.

38
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,230
TONIGHT I VOTE OUT COCHRAN, AND

39
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,692
THE NEXT NIGHT I VOTE FOR EDNA.

40
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,945
Jeff: COCHRAN HEADS TO

41
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,324
REDEMPTION ISLAND AND EDNA HAS

42
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,283
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STAY IN

43
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,745
THE GAME.

44
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,883
OH, COCHRAN.

45
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,885
COCHRAN, HAS ARRIVED.

46
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,180
COCHRAN, COCHRAN, COCHRAN.

47
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,390
WHY?

48
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,184
WHY?

49
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,310
DIDN'T YOU LEARN YOUR LESSON?

50
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,395
I GOT-- YOU KNOW, I GOT

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:44,854
SCREWED.

52
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,689
I'M HUMILIATED.

53
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,398
OH, GOD.

54
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,691
I'M SORRY, BUDDY.

55
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,359
IT HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US.

56
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,194
THE BIG MOVE I MADE AT THE

57
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,697
MERGE IN JUMPING OVER TO UPOLU,

58
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,033
IN RETROSPECT, MAY NOT HAVING

59
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:57,742
HAVE BEEN THE BEST MOVE.

60
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,161
I ABSOLUTELY FEEL LIKE UPOLU

61
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:00,745
USED ME.

62
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,038
THE FACT THAT THEY DID

63
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,331
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SHOW

64
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,209
REQUEST SORT OF GRATITUDE,
APART

65
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,919
FROM LIP SERVICE, IS INSULTING

66
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,503
TO ME.

67
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,004
DRANK THE KOOL-AID.

68
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:10,713
I KNOW YOU DID.

69
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,382
WELL, I'VE GOT A WAY THAT YOU

70
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,716
CAN NOT LET THEM WIN.

71
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,426
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS VOTE FOR

72
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,095
ME IF I MAKE IT.

73
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,722
IF YOU HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN ME

74
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,557
OR COACH?

75
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,726
UHM... I'M NOT READY TO

76
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,686
COMMIT TO THAT.

77
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,395
AND IT'S KIND OF INSULTING

78
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,982
THAT'S THAT IT'S ALREADY A

79
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,066
FORGONE CONCLUSION IN HIS MIND

80
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:31,776
THAT I'M GOING TO LOSE AT THE

81
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,485
DUEL.

82
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,736
WHAT IF I DEMOLISH YOU IN A

83
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,445
DUEL.

84
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:34,779
HOW COME THAT'S NEVER TALKED

85
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,238
ABOUT?

86
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,406
THAT'S TRUE.

87
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,407
AS A POSSIBILITY.

88
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,157
THAT'S TRUE.

89
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,742
AND IF YOU MAKE IT TO THE END

90
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,410
I'LL VOTE FOR YOU?

91
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,244
REALLY?

92
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,370
HOW ABOUT THAT?

93
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,248
DO I HAVE A CHANCE OF BEATING

94
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:45,748
YOU AT A DUEL?

95
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,583
YOU HAVE A CHANCE.

96
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,252
EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE.

97
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,753
HE REALLY DOESN'T STAND A

98
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,381
CHANCE.

99
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,048
Captioning brought to you by

100
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,926
Survivor Productions, CBS,

101
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,413
GOOD MORNING.

102

GOOD MORNING.

103
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,793

READY, BRO, I'D LIKE TO SAY

105
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,466
MORNING PRAY BEFORE EVERYBODY

106
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,804
DISBURSES.

107
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,555
SHE SAID SHE'S NOT PART OF

108
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,015
THIS TRIBE.

109
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:52,148
SO SHE WALKED OFF.

110
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,233
WHEN BRANDON ANNOUNCED HE

111
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,819
WANTED TO PRAY WITH THE TRIBE,

112
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,321
HE MADE IT CLEAR TO ME
YESTERDAY

113
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,948
AT TRIBAL THAT I'M NOT PART OF

114
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:00,740
THE TRIBE.

115
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,491
I'M NEXT TO GO.

116
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,659
YOU SLEEP NEXT TO THESE PEOPLE

117
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,869
AND THEY TELL YOU FROM DAY ONE

118
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,496
THAT YOU'RE INCLUDED IN THE

119
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,164
TRIBE, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,.

120
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:08,790
AND WE'RE GOING TO PREACH

121
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,124
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY.

122
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,168
I FEEL LIKE COCHRAN HAS.

123
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,544
I FEEL DUPED.

124
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,965
THANK YOU FOR EDNA, FATHER

125
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,841
GOD.

126
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,969
COACH AND HOW CAN YOU BE NOT

127
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,844
THE LEADER?

128
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,512
HE'S THE ONE PREACHING IT DAY
IN

129
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,013
AND DAY OUT.

130
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,847
THIS IS REALITY.

131
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,349
THIS IS REAL LIFE FOR THESE

132
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,850
INDIVIDUALS, AND TO TREAT ME

133
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,978
LIKE A SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN, IS

134
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:35,233
THAT TRUE LIFE?

135
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,567
I CAN'T BELIEVE I VOLUNTEERED
TO

136
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,987
COME OUT HERE TO BE DECEIVED BY

137
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,571
EVERYBODY.

138
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,198
EVERYBODY GETS DECEIVED.

00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,200
IT'S JUST EYE JUST FEEL LIKE

140
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:49,539

SIX STRONG, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

142
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,499
BUT WE WERE.

143
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,376
NOW THERE'S SIX, OKAY.

144
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,210

SORRY, SORRY.

147
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,547
WE ARE A TRIBE.

148
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,590
IT NOW GOINGS AN INDIVIDUAL

149
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,299
GAME.

THAT'S WHAT I DON'T LIKE.

00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,564
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

159
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,314

SPIT ON A MILLION DOLLARS.

641
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,615
SPIT ON THE SOLE "SURVIVOR."

642
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,367
WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR, THEN?

643
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,494
I'M HERE TO SET AN EXAMPLE

644
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,995
FOR CHRIST, BRO.

645
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,830
AND I'M GOING TO PLAY THIS GAME

646
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,208
OUT WITH HONOR AND INTEGRITY
AND

647
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:51,833
LIKE CHRIST WOULD PLAY IT.

648
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,501
I KNOW YOU'RE LOYAL AND

649
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,878
THAT'S THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS

650
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,712
TAUGHT YOU TO BE.

651
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,838
BUT I'M JUST SAYING.

652
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,589
WHAT?

653
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,340
AT THE END OF THE DAY AND YOU

654
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,133
KNOW THAT A MOVE WOULD PUT YOU

655
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,177
INTO THE FINAL THREE--

656
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,844
NO.

657
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,012
BRANDON, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

658
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:04,972
I'M NOT KIDDING YOU.

659
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,974
YOU CAME HERE TO WIN A

660
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,058
MILLION DOLLARS.

661
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:08,892
LET'S NOT LOSE PERSPECTIVE.

662
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:09,643
IT'S CHANGED.

663
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,019
IT'S CHANGED, MAN.

664
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,688
I'M SORRY IF IT MAKE US UPSET.

665
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,523
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME UPSET THAT

666
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,482
YOU WANT TO STAND ON THE FACT

667
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,317
THAT YOU'RE A CRIB BUT YOU'RE

668
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,402
ALSO HERE TO DO A JOB AND THAT

669
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,112
JOB IS TO BRING HOME THE GOLD.

670
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,072
I'M SEEING BRANDON FRAZZLED.

671
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,240
I'M SEEING HIM EYE DON'T LIKE

672
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:23,991
WHAT I SEE.

673
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,535
SO I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I CAME

674
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,494
TODAY BECAUSE IF I HAD TO GRADE

675
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,247
BRANDON ON THE WAY HE'S PLAYING

676
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,581
RIGHT NOW I'D PROBABLY GIVE HIM

677
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,916
ABOUT A "C."

678
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,043
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE HASN'T

679
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,545
GOTTEN VOTED OUT YET.

680
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,505
GOD ALSO WANTS US TO BE WISE,
BE

681
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,591
WISE AND MAKE A GOOD POSITION.

682
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,968
PUT YOUR FAMILY IN A GOOD

683
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:43,719
POSITION OR YOU CAN JUST GO

684
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,470
PREACH ON THE STREET CORNER AND

685
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,180
DON'T WORRY ABOUT MONEY.

686
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,516
JUST TRUST THAT GOD-- GOD--
DUDE,

687
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,518
OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN PLANNED OUT

688
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,394
SINCE WE WERE BORN, BRO.

689
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,771
HE HAS TO BEGIN TO PLAY THE

690
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,440
GAME AND PLAY IT TO WIN IT.

691
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,233
IT'S THE HANTZ WAY, BABY.

692
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,526
YOU HAVE GOT TO PUT YOURSELF

693
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,861
INTO THIS FINAL THREE, AND THEN

694
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,195
AT THAT POINT THAT'S WHEN IT'S

695
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,030
UP TO GOD.

696
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,115
I'M GLAD I CAME OUT HERE.

697
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,951
BECAUSE BRANDON REALLY LOOKS

698
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,080
LIKE HE'S NOT HOLDING TOGETHER

699
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:12,414
WELL.

700
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,081
YEAH.

701
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,916
SO I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM

702
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,668
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE
HIM,

703
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,087
YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE-- WHERE YOU

704
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:19,755
REALLY WERE WITH HIM.

705
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,464
YEAH, YEAH, SURE.

706
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,591
YOU'RE THE SINGLE PERSON THAT

707
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:28,055
HE HAS ALL HIS EGGS IN BASKET.

708
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,264
AT THIS POINT, WHO DO YOU WANT

709
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,140
TO BRING TO THE FINAL THREE?

710
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,808
WHEN IT GET TO FIVE, I HAVE

711
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,559
TO FIGURE OUT--

712
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,643
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A

713
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,352
DECISION.

714
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,187
I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION--

715
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,940
BEFORE I LEAVE HERE, I'LL

716
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,150
TELL HIM WHATEVER YOU TELL HIM

717
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:40,901
TO DO, PERIOD.

718
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,278
IT'S IN YOUR HANDS.

719
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,196
SO THERE IT IS.

720
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:44,905
THAT'S IT.

721
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,615
BRANDON HANTZ'S DAD, A CHIP

722
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,658
OFF THE OLD BLOCK.

723
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,493
THEY'RE ALL CUT OF THE SAME

724
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,368
CLOTH.

725
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:55,248
BRANDON'S DAD COMES OUT HERE
AND

726
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,124
BASICALLY TRIES TO BULLY ME
INTO

727
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:56,792
MAKING SURE HIS SON GOES ALL
THE

728
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,417
WAY TO THE END AND WINS A

729
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,126
MILLION DOLLARS.

730
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,628
EVEN IF HE WINS A CHALLENGE,

731
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,506
HE GOES TO YOU TO ASK WHAT--

732
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,299
EVER SINGLE VOTE, I'LL GO TO

733
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,634
YOU TO ASK.

734
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,510
ALL RIGHT.

735
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,178
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

736
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:08,637
ARE WE DOWN?

737
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,346
ARE WE STRAIGHT?

738
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,556
IT'S ALL ABOUT MANIPULATION

739
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,100
AND CONTROL AND THE HANTZ
FAMILY

740
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:13,809
ARE THE KINGPINS.

741
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,814
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYBODY

742
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,315
BROW BEAT ME AND HANDCUFF ME

743
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,483
INTO A FINAL THREE WITH
BRANDON.

744
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:26,029
THE KID IS A LOOSE CANNON.

745
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,531
( TICK-TICK-TICK )

746
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,658
HE IS A TICKING TIME BOMB.

00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,080
CAN NEVER STEP PACK ON TO IT.

762
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:17,706
ONCE YOU'RE OUT OF MOVES,
YOU'RE

763
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,624

777
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,035
ALBERT.

778
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,286
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AS BIG A

779
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,954
PIECE OF THIS PIE AS YOU CAN.

780
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,249
ONCE YOU RUN OUT OF YELLOW

781
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:01,917
TILES, YOU ARE OUT.

782
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,418
COACH, IS THIS CHALLENGE A

783
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,586
LITTLE BIT LIKE A METAPHOR FOR

784
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,755
THE GAME, THE MOVES YOU MAKE

785
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,632
EARLY WILL DICTATE YOUR SUCCESS

786
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,257
LATER?

787
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,092
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

788
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,427
GREAT METAPHOR, JEFF.

789
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,804
TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF MY

790
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,263
MOUTH.

791
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,726
Jeff: SOPHIE.

792
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,435
ALBERT.

793
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,145
BRANDON WITH AN INTERESTING

794
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,772
MOVE, MOVES TOWARD ALBERT.

795
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:28,777
COACH IS MOVING CLOSER TO EDNA.

796
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,782
CIRCLE'S GETTING VERY SMALL.

797
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,992
LOOKS LIKE EDNA IS GETTING

798
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:41,539
SQUEEZED OUT.

799
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,626
EDNA JUST REDUCED BRANDON'S

800
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,002
OPTIONS QUITE A BIT.

801
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,337
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

802
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,632
Jeff: BRANDON FEELING VERY

803
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,636
CONFIDENT.

804
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,306
RICK MAKES HIS MOVE, AND WITH

805
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,183
THAT COACH GIVES WHAT APPEARS
TO

806
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,018
BE A DRAGON SLAYER MOVE.

807
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,437
IT LOOKED LIKE TO BE-- A LITTLE

808
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:09,109
DRAGON SLAYER.

809
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:09,818
ALBERT HAS ONE MOVE TO MAKE.

810
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,112
HE GOES INTO THE CENTER SQUARE,

811
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,989
AND THAT WILL BE ALBERT'S LAST

812
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,323
MOVE.

813
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,826
ALBERT IS OUT OF THIS
CHALLENGE.

814
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,496
EDNA LOOKING AT HER LIMITED

815
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,247
OPTIONS.

816
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,334
BRANDON MAKES HIS LAST MOVE SER

817
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,502
MOANSLY.

818
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:34,718
BRANDON, OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE

819
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,719
( APPLAUSE ).

820
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,637
I'M KIND OF EXPLAINING

821
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,179
EXACTLY WHAT I DID OVER HERE.

822
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:38,888
Jeff: WHAT'S THAT?

823
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,141
I WAS TALKING TO HIM ABOUT MY

824
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,350
LITTLE VAULT GEE THERE.

825
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,101
Jeff: WHAT WAS IT?

826
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,186
I JUST WANTED TO COVER ENOUGH

827
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,854
SURFACE AREA TO WHERE A

828
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,855
PARTICULAR PERSON DIDN'T WIN

829
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,605
THIS IMMUNITY.

830
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,691
YOU CAN JUST USE MY NAME FROM

831
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,818
NOW ON LIKE YOU DO.

832
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,361
Jeff: EDNA, THEY TALKING

833
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,362
ABOUT YOU?

834
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,238
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE

835
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:55,947
TALKING ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE
HERE.

836
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,866
IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

837
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,201
I WAS SO UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO BE

838
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,370
NOT ON THE BEACH THE FIRST DAY,

839
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,789
AND NOW THAT REPERCUSSION, JUST

840
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,874
LIKE YOU USED THE ANALOGY, YOUR

841
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,877
MOVES ON DAY ONE, OR YOUR EARLY

842
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,378
MOVES HAVE IMPLICATIONS LATER

843
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,506
ON.

844
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:22,182
Jeff: EDNA, YOU'RE UP.

845
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:22,891
COACH.

846
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,100
COACH CAN FEEL THE NECKLACE.

847
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,852
HE HAS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF
REAL

848
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,936
ESTATE ON THE BOARD.

849
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,899
IT IS HIS CHALLENGE TO LOSE.

850
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,566
RICK.

851
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,568
RICK MAKES HIS LAST MOVE.

852
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,569
THANK YOU

853
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,195

854
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,029
Jeff: TAKE A SPOT ON THE

855
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:40,200
BENCH.

856
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,118
SOPHIE MAKES HER LAST MOVE.

857
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,871
SOPHIE'S OUT OF THE CHALLENGE

858
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,040
( APPLAUSE )

859
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:51,669
EDNA, EDNA WITH EVERY MOVE YOU

00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,922
MAKE, YOU SEEM TO GET MORE

861
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,631
AGITATED.

862
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,967
IT'S A BIT OF INSULT TO SAY

863
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:58,718
MILDLY.

864
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,761
IT'S BEEN A TEAM SPORT FOR SOME

865
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,096
INDIVIDUALS AND AT SOME POINT,

866
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:01,888
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
REALIZE

867
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:06,059
IT WILL BE AN INDIVIDUAL GAME.

868
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,811
Jeff: EDNA, MAKE YOUR LAST

869
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,439
MOVE.

870
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,900
WITH THAT, COACH WINS
INDIVIDUAL

871
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,902

Jeff: COACH, SAFE TONIGHT

877
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:32,627
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

878
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,129
CANNOT VOTE FOR COACH.

879
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,631
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, EDNA,

880
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,592
RICK, BRANDON, SOPHIE, ALBERT,

881
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,970

882
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,929
PACIFIC, SOMEBODY VOTED OUT

883
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,181
TONIGHT AND SENT TO REDEMPTION

884
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:45,932
ISLAND.

885
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,016
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

886
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,642
CAMP.

887
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:51,771
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

888
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,439
CONGRATS.

889
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,982
HELP A SISTER OUT, COACH.

890
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,527
BRANDON'S SO TRUTHFUL HE

891
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,821
STICKS HIS FREAKING SMELLY FOOT

892
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,322
IN HIS MOUTH AND GET IN
TROUBLE.

893
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,824
I'M NOT GOING TO LET THIS MAKE

894
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,533
ME DOWN.

895
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,284
IF SHE WANTS TO PUT ME AS HER

896
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,661
LITTLE BAD GUY TODAY, I'LL BE

897
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:07,328
THE BAD GUY.

898
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,037
HOPEFULLY MY TRIBE WILL STAY

899
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,831
STRONG AND AS LONG AS WE COI

900
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,041
HAVE MORE GAME TO PLAY AND I'M

901
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,043
GOING TO ENJOY THAT BREAKFAST
ON

902
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,171
DAY 39.

903
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,980
EVERY DAY, THE PEOPLE IN THIS

904
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,356
TRIBE SURPRISE ME WITH THE

905
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,107
THINGS THEY DO.

906
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,817
AND EVERY DAY I'M RECALCULATING

907
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,027
WHO I THINK THE JURY'S GOING TO

908
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,028
HATE WHO I THINK THE JURY'S

909
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,779
GOING TO LOVE.

910
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,198
AND BRANDON OPENED HIS MOUTH.

911
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,032
HE WAS REALLY RUDE TO EDNA.

912
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,494
THERE WAS NO REASON TO TELL HER

913
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,077
"WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET YOU

914
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:48,828
OUT."

915
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,039
I MEAN, THAT'S A BULLYING THING

916
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:51,706
TO DO.

917
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:55,418
DO YOU BOYS NEED SOME WATER

918
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,169
FILTERED?

919
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,879
WHY DO YOU GOT TO DO THAT,

920
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,379
BRANDON?

921
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,881
AND I LIKE EDNA.

922
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,049
IT DIDN'T NEED TO HAPPEN.

923
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,175
SHE WAS CLEARLY NOT GOING TO
WIN

924
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,552
THE GAME SO WHY KICK HER IN THE

925
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,221
GUTS LIKE A LITTLE DOG, CALLING

926
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,096
A DOG OVER, COME HERE, COME

927
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,224
HERE, COME HERE, AND WHACK IT
IN

928
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,391
THE GUT WITH YOUR FOOT.

929
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,851
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

930
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,353
EDNA, I JUST WANTED TO LET

931
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,896
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE

932
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,939
YOU FEEL BAD OR ANYTHING.

933
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,065
WELL, YOU DID.

934
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,066
DID I REALLY?

935
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,901
YES, I WAS ABOUT TO CRY.

936
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,528
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO CRY

937
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,111
NOW.

938
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,239
WELL, YOU KNOW ME IN ANY

939
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:24,906
SITUATION, I'M VERY TRANSPARENT

940
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,283
WITH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

941
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,451
HOPEFULLY YOU RESPECT THAT.

942
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,912
I DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM.

943
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,247
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE WE

944
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:32,914
SAYING SOMEONE'S NAME.

945
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,832
THE FACT THAT YOU EVEN

946
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,084
BROUGHT IT UP IS A LITTLE BIT

947
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,043
UNNECESSARY TO MENTION.

948
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,044
I THINK.

949
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,088
ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M SORRY

950
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,589
AND I HOPE YOU ACCEPT MY

951
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,298
APOLOGY.

952
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,925
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, IT'S

953
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,219
LIKE YOU ALREADY DID IT, SO.

954
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,762
I UNDERSTAND.

955
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,097
I ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY

956
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,722
ACTION.

957
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,433
BRANDON DID VERBALIZE AN

958
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,269
APOLOGY BUT IT'S INSIGNE TEAR.

959
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,312
IT'S LIKE BEATING YOUR WIFE.

960
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,647
AND THEN APPROXIMATIONING OR

961
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,774
BUYING HER A DIAMOND NECKLACE.

962
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,901
I BOUGHT HER A DIAMOND
NECKLACE.

963
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,403
I APOLOGIZED, AND THAT'S IT.

964
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:07,115
IN HIS MIND, IT'S LIKE OKAY,
SHE

965
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:07,782
APOLOGIZED.

966
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:08,950
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

967
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:09,576
INSULT.

968
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,912
BRENDAN, I THINK, OFTEN

969
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,290
THINKS HIS APOLOGY ABSOLVES ALL

970
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:15,999
SIN.

971
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:16,749
MAYBE THAT'S TRUE IN CHURCH BUT

972
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,460
ON "SURVIVOR" PEOPLE ARE NOT AS

973
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,670
FORGIVING, YOU KNOW, AS JESUS

974
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,546
CHRIST IS.

975
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,213
AND EDNA IS NOT AS FORGIVING
AND

976
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,966
THE REST OF THE TRIBE-- IT

977
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:32,307
DIDN'T GO UNNOTICED WITH US.

978
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,975
I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU

979
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,851
ALL.

980
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,770
OBVIOUSLY, I WANT TO SAVE MY
OWN

981
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:38,146
HIDE AND LIVE ANOTHER DAY IN

982
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:38,896
THIS GAME.

983
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,524
MY CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW IS AT THE

984
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,028
EXPENSE OF BRANDON.

985
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,154
WE'VE BEEN PREACHING THAT OUR

986
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,989
TRIBE IS ABOUT HONOR,
INTEGRITY,

987
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,491
AND PLAYING THIS LIKE IT'S REAL

988
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,367
LIFE.

989
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,161
AND I FEEL AS THO THE ACTIONS
OF

990
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,832
BRANDON IN THE LAST 32 DAYS

991
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:58,833
DON'T-- AREN'T REALLY
CONSISTENT

992
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,834
WITH THAT.

993
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:01,878
IT'S DAY 32, AND I ASK YOU TO

994
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,838
DEFINE WHAT HONOR AND INTEGRITY

995
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:04,547
IS.

996
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,341
DOES IT INCLUDE LYING TO YOUR

997
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,467
OTHER TRIBE MATES?

998
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,009
DOES IT INCLUDE ALL THESE

999
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,219
EMOTIONAL OUTBREAKS?

1000
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,805
I JUST ASK YOU TO JUXTAPOSE

1001
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,390
AGAINST THE WAY I PERFORMED IN

1002
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,141
THIS GAME.

1003
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,851
I JUST CANNOT ACCEPT THE FACT

1004
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,853
THAT OUR TRIBE SAYS HONOR AND

1005
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:19,520
INTEGRITY AND HONOR AND

1006
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,813
INTEGRITY AND THEN YOU ALLOW

1007
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,189
SUCH BEHAVIOR TO HAPPEN IN OUR

1008
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:21,939
CAMP.

1009
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,232
THAT IS ALMOST A HALL PASS FOR

1010
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,027
HIM TO ACT IRRATIONALLY AROUND

1011
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,362
CAMP AND EMOTIONALLY
DESTRUCTIVE

1012
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,031
TO EVERYBODY AROUND US-- ME,

1013
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,532
MIKAYLA, YOU GUYS, WHEN YOU
GUYS

1014
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,660
WERE INVOLVED IN THE MIKAYLA

1015
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,369
THING.

1016
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:34,744
MY NECK IS IN THE GUILLOTINE

1017
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,204
RIGHT NOW.

1018
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,873
AND I'M JUST GIVING YOU GUYS--

1019
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,375
PLEASE, GIVE ME ONE MORE DAY

1020
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,000
HERE.

1021
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:45,046
EDNA PROVOCATIVELY PUT

1022
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:45,797
SOMETHING ON THE TABLE.

1023
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,674
VOTE OUT BRANDON TONIGHT, KEEP

1024
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,217
ME, AND THE FOUR OF US WILL
TAKE

1025
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,553
OWNERSHIP OF THIS GAME.

1026
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,513
SYSTEMATICALLY SHE JUST LAID IT

1027
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,222
ALL THE OUT FOR US.

1028
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,224
IF THERE'S ANY ARGUMENT FOR US

1029
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,393
TO SEND SOMEBODY ELSE HOME

1030
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,062
TONIGHT, SHE SERVED BRANDON UP

1031
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,230
VO-PITCH STYLE.

1032
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,233
A PITCH WE CAN KNOCK OUT OF THE

1033
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:05,983
PARK.

1034
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,819
ON A DAY WE DEFINITELY THOUGHT

1035
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:08,528
EDNA WAS GOING TO GO HOME,

1036
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,238
THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.

1037
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,282
ALL RIGHT, GIVE IT TO ME

1038
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:17,203
STRAIGHT.

1039
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,246
YOU TAKE AN INDEPENDENT JURY.

1040
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,374
AND YOU PUT EDNA ON THE STAND

1041
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,419
AND YOU PUT BRENDAN ON THE

1042
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,169
STABBED.

1043
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,421
WHO WILL BE CONVICTED GUILTY?

1044
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,004
BRANDON.

1045
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,256
WHO IS MORE DESERVING OF

1046
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,757
STAYING?

1047
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,174
IDNA.

1048
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:30,925
ABSOLUTELY.

1049
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,218
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEND BRANDON

1050
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,886
TO REDEMPTION, HAVE HIM WIN AND

1051
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,929
COME BACK.

1052
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,264
THAT'S FINE AND GOOD AND

1053
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:36,973
EVERYTHING.

1054
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,600
IT'S JUST-- I HAVE TO ASK THIS

1055
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,727
QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S
DEFINITELY

1056
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,103
AN OPTION.

1057
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:46,941
WOULD YOU BE-- I HAVE TO ASK IT

1058
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,109
BECAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY AN

1059
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:48,818
OPTION.

1060
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,736
WILL YOU PLAY YOUR IDOL FOR ME?

1061
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,445
NO.

1062
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,571
WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS FOR

1063
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,447
THE IDOL.

1064
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,781
WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL USE
IT?

1065
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,491
I DON'T THINK I'LL USE IT.

1066
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,118
IF I USE THE IDOL RIGHT NOW,

1067
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,786
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE GAME NO

1068
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,620
LONGER TRUST MEAS.

1069
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,956
IF I PLAY THE IDOL, I'M FOR
SURE

1070
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,915
THE NEXT PERSON TO GO.

1071
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,292
IF I GIVE YOU THE IDOL THEY'RE

1072
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,211
GOING TO VOTE MY ASS OFF.

1073
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:07,920
LIKE, 100%.

1074
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,298
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN

1075
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,299
WITHOUT AT LEAST ATTEMPTING

1076
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,049
EVERYTHING.

1077
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,635
I ADMIRE THAT, I ADMIRE THAT.

1078
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,095
YOU KNOW, ABSOLUTELY, YOU
SHOULD

1079
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,181
GO UP AND TELL, YOU KNOW,
ALBERT

1080
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,100
AND SOPHIE.

1081
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,935
YOU SHOULD GO TELL ALBERT AND

1082
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,478
SOPHIE I TALKED TO COACH AND

1083
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,354
EVERYTHING IS COOL.

1084
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,731
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

1085
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,817
SEE HOW THEY VOTE.

1086
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,497
OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GOING TO BE

1087
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,623
WRITING MY NAME DOWN.

1088
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,000
I'LL BE WRITING BRANDON'S NAME

1089
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,709
DOWN.

1090
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,460
ALL I NEED IS THE 22 OF YOU TOO

1091
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,003
COME ON BOARD AND JUST-- I JUST

1092
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,463
WANT TO HEAR IF THAT'S
SOMETHING

1093
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,507
THAT YOU WOULD EVEN CONSIDER.

1094
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,051
HONESTLY, I'M NOT GOING TO

1095
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:55,676
B.S. YOU.

1096
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,010
I'M GIVING IT LEGITIMATE

1097
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:56,677
THOUGHT.

1098
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,637
I JUST HAVE TO KNOW THAT OUR

1099
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:57,970
NUMBERS ARE THERE.

1100
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:58,638
RIGHT.

1101
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,348
IT'S JUST YOU AND SOPHIE,

1102
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,015
BASICALLY.

1103
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,559
YOU'RE SAYING COACH IS 100%

1104
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,227
IN RIGHT NOW.

1105
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,646
ABSOLUTELY.

1106
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,355
100%.

1107
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:07,939
I PERSONALLY NEVER HEARD THAT

1108
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:08,397
FROM HIM, BUT OKAY.

1109
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,526
COACH IS 100%.

1110
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,612
I'LL EAT-- THE ONLY THING I CAN

1111
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,490
SAY IS I'LL EAT A PIECE OF HIS

1112
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,199
( BLEEP ).

1113
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,867
THAT'S HOW MUCH OF 100% I AM

1114
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,994
THAT HE'S IN WITH THIS.

1115
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,080
YOU KNOW, EDNA CAN KIND OF

1116
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,873
FEEL THE HEAT BARING DOWN ON

1117
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,541
HER.

1118
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,209
BUT EDNA SMACKS REALLY GOOD

1119
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,085
POINS.

1120
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,213
EDNA SAID STRAIGHT UP, I'M NOT
A

1121
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:32,922
THREAT.

1122
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,674
I'M NOT GOING TO WIN THE GAME.

1123
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,383
I'M NOT GOING TO BE VERY

1124
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,510
COMPETITIVE IN CHALLENGES.

1125
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,386
JUST SAVE MY NECK NOW AND I CAN

1126
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,889
GUARANTEE YOU GUYS A PLACE IN

1127
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,515
THE FINAL FOUR.

1128
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,184
AT THIS POINT IN ANYTIME

1129
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,520
SURVIVOR" ANY TIME YOU CAN HAVE

1130
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,188
A PLACE THAT DEEP IN THE GAME,

1131
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:49,897
IT'S APPEALING.

1132
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,899
IF I CAN DO THAT, THERE'S A

1133
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,734
CHANCE BRANDON MIGHT HAVE A BIG

1134
00:35:53,818 --> 00:36:03,828
SURPRISE TONIGHT.

1135
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:10,918
SURPRISE TONIGHT.

1136
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:11,878
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1137
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:16,883
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1138
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,551
JIM.

1139
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,427
KEITH.

1140
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,761
DAWN.

1141
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,178
WHITNEY.

1142
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:25,433
AND COCHRAN.

1143
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,435
SO, EDNA, BASED ON TODAY'S

1144
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,604
CHALLENGE, IT'S CLEAR YOU'RE IN

1145
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,771
THE HOT SEAT TONIGHT.

1146
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,982
WHEN YOU GO BACK TO CAMP, WHO
DO

1147
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,817
YOU TARGET AS THE PERSON WHO

1148
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,777
SHOULD GO HOME INSTEAD OF YOU?

1149
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,072
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TARGET

1150
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:40,781
BRANDON.

1151
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,408
HIS OBJECTIONS, BEHAVIORS, AND

1152
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,409
WORDS HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT

1153
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,120
WITH OUR UPOLU MANTRA OF-- WHAT

1154
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:49,290
IS IT AGAIN, COACH?

1155
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,461
OUR MANTRA IS HONOR, LOYALTY,

1156
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,045
INTEGRITY.

1157
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,296
AND I THINK OF ALL THE

1158
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,382
REMAINING TRIBE MEMBERS,
BRANDON

1159
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,344
DEVIATES MOST FROM OUR MANTRA.

1160
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,470
FROM THE FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL,

1161
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,432
HE PLOTTED A LIE THAT INVOLVED

1162
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,267
STACEY AND CHRISTINE AGAINST

1163
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,477
MIKAYLA TO CREATE DISRUPTION.

1164
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,978
TODAY'S CHALLENGE WAS ANOTHER

1165
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:11,687
CHAMPION.

1166
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,605
HE SAID, "MY STRATEGY WAS TO

1167
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,274
PREVENT YOU, EDNA, FROM WINNING

1168
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:15,983
IMMUNITY."

1169
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,609
HOW IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH

1170
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,319
HONOR AND INTEGRITY?

1171
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,487
Jeff: BRANDON, WHAT'S IT

1172
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,947
LIKE TO HEAR THIS MOMENTS
BEFORE

1173
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,823
WE VOTE SOMEBODY TO REDEMPTION

1174
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,491
ISLAND?

1175
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,367
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1176
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,493
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING

1177
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:30,289
NEGATIVE TO SAY ABOUT EDNA.

1178
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,791
SHE'S MISCONSTREWED A LOT OF

1179
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,375
THINGS.

1180
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,042
SHE'S BEEN INACCURATE --

1181
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,627
I HAVE TO SAY, BRENDAN, I

1182
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,628
REMEMBER THE FIRST TRIBAL AND

1183
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,171
THE LIE AND I REMEMBER YOU

1184
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:37,880
ADMITTING IT.

1185
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,881
AND EVERYONE HERE, INCLUDING

1186
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,840
OUR JURY, KNOWS THAT.

1187
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,342
Jeff: I THOUGHT YOU WERE

1188
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,260
JUST SAYING SHE'S MISCONSTRUED

1189
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:43,844
EVERYTHING.

1190
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,054
WELL, MY APOLOGIES.

1191
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,514
HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE SHE'S
JUST

1192
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,515
TAKING SHOTS AT ME.

1193
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,434
I DON'T MIND BEING A PUNCHING

1194
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,895
BAG TODAY BUT I DON'T THINK SHE

1195
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,690
SHOULD TAKE AT MY CHARACTER

1196
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,399
PERSONALLY.

1197
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,108
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY OPEN

1198
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,985
WITH EVERYTHING, WITH EVERY

1199
00:37:59,068 --> 00:37:59,568
SINGLE THING.

1200
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,820
Jeff: SO, WOULD IT HURT

1201
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,238
YOUR FEELINGS IF YOU WERE VOTE

1202
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:02,697
OUT TONIGHT?

1203
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,364
ABSOLUTELY.

1204
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,240
AND AFTER HEARING THE THINGS

1205
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,408
THAT EDNA SAID ABOUT ME, IT
HURT

1206
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,743
MY FEELINGS A LOT BECAUSE I'VE

1207
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,704
NEVER HAD A NEGATIVE THING TO

1208
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,664
SAY ABOUT EDNA, DESPITE THE
FACT

1209
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,873
THAT SHE'S RUNNING AROUND THE

1210
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,917
TRIBE AND PLANTING SEEDS IN

1211
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:15,501
PEOPLE'S MINDS.

1212
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,669
Jeff: EDNA--

1213
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,005
TO CLARIFY, I WASN'T PLANTING

1214
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:19,714
SEEDS.

1215
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,841
I AM NOT FABRICATING THE EVENTS

1216
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,009
THAT HAPPENED.

1217
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:23,676
THEY WANT.

1218
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,510
I DIDN'T MAKE ONE OF THOSE

1219
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,554
THINGS UP.

1220
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,848
Jeff: SOPHIE, TAKE ME

1221
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:29,849
THROUGH THE DIFFICULTY OF

1222
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,518
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1223
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,895
NOW THAT YOU ARE WITH A GROUP
OF

1224
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,397
PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN

1225
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,064
TOGETHER FOR 32 DAYS?

1226
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,107
RIGHT.

1227
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,525
AS EVERYBODY SAID, WE'RE A

1228
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,109
FAMILY.

1229
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:40,776
WE HAVE ALL THIS UNITY.

1230
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,070
WE HAVE ALL THIS LOYALTY.

1231
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,072
BUT AS SAVAII HAS BEEN
REMINDING

1232
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:45,781
US, IT'S GOING TO END SOON, AND

1233
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,408
I THINK TODAY IS THAT DAY THAT

1234
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,451
IT'S ENDING.

1235
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,453
Jeff: ALBERT, WHERE DO YOU

1236
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,162
SIT ON THIS?

1237
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,247
WELL, IT GETS DIFFICULT WHEN

1238
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,291
YOU GOAT THIS POINT YOU KNOW

1239
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,292
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE

1240
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,043
CONTRIBUTED TO US GETTING HERE,

1241
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,586
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT CORE,

1242
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,504
IT ALWAYS STARTS TO GET THINNER

1243
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,089
AND THINNER THE DEEPER GO INTO

1244
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,924
THIS GAME AND WE'RE MAKING A

1245
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,426
DECISION BETWEEN HOW THE GAME
IS

1246
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:05,968
PLAYED OUT AND THE PROMISES
THAT

1247
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:10,598
WERE MADE EARLY ON.

1248
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,599
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET

1249
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,433
TO THE VOTE.

1250
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,977
COACH HAS THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.

1251
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,312
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1252
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,813
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1253
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:27,907
RICK, YOU'RE UP.

1254
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:35,414
RICK, YOU'RE UP.

1255
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,457
BRANDON, I KNOW YOU CAME OUT

1256
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,959
HERE TO CLEANSE YOUR FAMILY

1257
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:39,794
NAME.

1258
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,961
YOU'RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD
JOB

1259
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:41,504
AT IT.

1260
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:51,597
I'M SORRY.

1261
00:39:51,680 --> 00:40:01,816
I'M SORRY.

1262
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,652
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1263
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:10,616
VOTES.

1264
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,662
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1265
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,371
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1266
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,164
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1267
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,165
TO DO SO.

1268
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:18,791
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1269
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,708
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1270
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,794
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1271
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,796
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
AREA

1272
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,338
IMMEDIATELY.

1273
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,841
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1274
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:33,806
FIRST VOTE, EDNA.

1275
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,808
BRANDON.

1276
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,392
EDNA.

1277
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,310
TWO VOTES EDNA, ONE VOTE

1278
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,646
BRANDON.

1279
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,647
EDNA.

1280
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,566
THREE VOTES EDNA, ONE VOTE

1281
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:49,155
BRANDON.

1282
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,198
14th PERSON VOTED OUT, EDNA.

1283
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:51,824
THAT'S FOUR.

1284
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:52,700
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1285
00:40:52,783 --> 00:41:03,169
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.

1286
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,838
EDNA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1287
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,173
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

1288
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,299
BACK IN THIS GAME.

1289
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:08,716
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

1290
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,718
HEAD TO I'D.

1291
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,552
GOOD LUCK.

1292
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:19,018
THANKS, JEFF.

1293
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,561
Jeff: WELL, FROM THE

1294
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,562
BEGINNING, YOU'VE SAID IT WOULD

1295
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,731
BE THE FIVE OF YOU.

1296
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,357
NOW WHAT?

1297
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,233

1311
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:50,758
INTEGRITY.

1312
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,300
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

1313
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,551
DON'T YOU LIE TO ME.

1314
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,385
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

1315
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,222
THEY TOLD US.

1316
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,598
WILL YOU ( BLEEP ) LET ME

1317

1318
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,100
I DO NOT CARE A SINGLE THING

1319
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,101
ABOUT HONOR AND INTEGRITY.

1320
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:01,769
EDNA THINKS SHE MAY HAVE IT.

1321
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,854
NO WAY.

1322
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,110
OZZY?

1323
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,695
YEAH.

1324
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,948
SORERY TO SCARE YOU.

1325
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:14,365
IT'S EDNA.

1326
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,032
HEY, EDNA.

1327
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,659
I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO

1328
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,954
SEE COACH WRITE DOWN MY NAME.

1329
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,789
HIS CONSTANT FEAR OF LOOKING

1330
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,750
LIKE HE'S BETRAYED THE TRIBE
HAS

1331
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,835
MADE ME FEEL BETRAYED BY HIM.
