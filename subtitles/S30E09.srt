JENN WERE STUCK ON THE BOTTOM.

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,050

00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:12,929
ALLIANCE OF SEVEN.

7
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,639
>> THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO GET

8
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,143
TO THE END IS BY TAKING BIG

9
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:18,435
RISKS.

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,978
>> Jeff: BUT SHIRIN HAD A PLAN

11
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:20,895
THE SHAKE THINGS UP.

12
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,814
SHE WARNED MIKE ABOUT A SECRET

13
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,398
ALLIANZ WITHIN THE SEVEN.

14
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,650

>> SHIRIN'S SMART ENOUGH TO

18
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,779
REALIZE THERE'S A GROUP WITHIN

19
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,947
OUR GROUP.

20
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,449
I SEE IT.

21
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,117
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT

NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

25
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,169
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY, JOE.

26

IN THE END THEY TOOK OUT JOE,

27
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:46,796
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN

28
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,505
CHALLENGES.

29
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,591
JOE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

30
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,467
NINE ARE LEFT.

31
00:00:50,550 --> 00:01:04,814
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

32
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,317

36
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,824
WE CAN GET HIM OUT RIGHT NOW AND

37
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,243
HE'LL NEVER KNOW.

38
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,119
>> MIKE, ARE YOU CRAZY?

39
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,288
>> WE GOT RID OF JOE LAST NIGHT,

40
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,373
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THE GAME,

41
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,459
AND RIGHT OFF THE BAT RODNEY

42
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,877
APPROACHED ME WITH A NEW TACTIC,

43
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,337
WHICH IS WHY DON'T WE STOMP ON

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,756
MIKE BEFORE HE PULLS HIS NUMBERS

45
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,758
AND HIS CHARISMA AND JUMPS ON

46
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,343
US, AND RODNEY'S IDEA COULD BE A

47
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:39,140
REALLY GOOD IDEA.

48
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,226
>> WE'LL COME BACK AND REVISIT

49
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:41,476
IT.

50
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,227
>> ABSOLUTELY.

51
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,728
>> YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE FINAL

52
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:43,937
FOUR.

53
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,356
>> I OVERHEARD RODNEY, WILL,

54
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,067
TYLER AND MAMA C, AND THERE'S

55
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,692
DEFINITELY BEEN A POWER SHIFT IN

56
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,945
THIS GAME.

57
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,905
RODNEY HAS FLIPPED ON THE BLUE

58
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,155
COLLARS.

59
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,199
HE IS NO LONGER IN MY ALLIANCE.

60
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,327

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,039
>> SOMEONE JUST DO $20.

191
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:13,915
>> $20.

192
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,500
>> Jeff: SIERRA, GOING TO BID

193
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,793

00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,585
GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE, SOLD TO

195
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,795
SIERRA.

196
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:23,299
COME UP, $20.

197
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,884
WE SET THE PRICE AT $20, WHICH

198
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,302
MEANS ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTS TO

199
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,470
BUY THEIR LOVED ONE LETTERS FROM

200
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,472

00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,309
INTERESTING POSITION.

203
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,686
>> LET'S ALL DO IT FOR $20, AND

204
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,188
THEN WE FIGHT FOR THE ADVANTAGE

205
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,066
FAIR AND SQUARE WITH $480.

206
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,234
WHO IS IN?

207
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,361
>> PLEASE.

208
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,071
>> Jeff: WHO WANTS IT?

209
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,239
EVERYONE'S IN FOR $20.

>> Jeff: EVERYBODY COMING UP.

214
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,207
ALL RIGHT.

215
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,543
FIND YOUR NOTE.

216
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,253
>> I'M GOING TO DO IT.

217
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,587
I'M NOT GOING TO TRICK YOU GUYS.

218
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,004
>> PLEASE, PLEASE.

219
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:07,051
>> WHY WOULD I DISPLACE TRUST?

220
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,302
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, DAN.

221
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:08,845
GRAB YOURS.

222
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,470
YOU SAW IT SITTING THERE.

223
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,682
WHY ARE YOU ALREADY SO

224
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,519
EMOTIONAL?

225
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,438
>> I LOVE MY WIFE LIKE YOU READ

226
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,984
ABOUT, AND ON DAY TWO IT WAS MY

227
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,401
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

228
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,070
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

229
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:26,654
>> Jeff: BUT YOU JUST BOUGHT

230
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,156
IT FOR $20.

231
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,240
>> THANK YOU.

232
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,367
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

233
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,577
NICE.

234
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,661
MIKE, DID YOU...

235
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:38,082
>> YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

236
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:43,462
>> WOW.

237
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,161
>> MIKE DIDN'T DO IT?

238
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,787
>> HE DIDN'T DO IT.

239
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,413
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T GOING TO DO

240
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:17,872
IT.

241
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,623
>> ALL RIGHT.

242
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,625
I'LL GIVE MINE BACK.

243
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,876
THAT'S COOL.

244
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,543
I'LL GIVE IT BACK.

245
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:38,768
>> SO MUCH FOR YOUR TRUST, MIKE.

246
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,102
>> I CAN'T DO IT.

247
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,438
I CAN'T DO IT.

248
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,149
I CAN'T DO IT.

249
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,275
THAT WOULDN'T GO WITH MY

250
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:46,651
CONSCIENCE.

251
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,238
THAT GOES AGAINST WHO I AM AS A

252
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,199
PERSON.

253
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,159
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

254
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:55,743
SO IT'S CLEAR YOU HAVE BEEN

255
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,205
WAITING FOR IT.

256
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:03,292
THIS IS AN ADVANTAGE IN THE

257
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:03,459
GAME.

258
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,505
>> $480.

259
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:07,713
$480.

260
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,173
>> Jeff: MIKE, CAROLYN, DAN

261
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:09,590
ARE IN.

262
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,216
ALL RIGHT.

263
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:10,800
COME ON UP.

264
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,051
$480.

265
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,553
IT'S EVERYTHING YOU GOT.

266
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,888
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

267
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,555
DO, RIGHT?

268
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,890
>> DRAW STRAWS.

269
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,893
>> THE WINNING ROCK IS WHITE.

270
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:31,112
>> NO PROBLEM.

271
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:31,821
>> Jeff: ON THREE EVERYBODY

272
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,447
REVEAL.

273
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,323
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHITE.

274
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,451
ONE, TWO, THREE.

275
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,995
>> YEAH, BABY!

276
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:39,996
>> Jeff: DAN HAS WON THE

277
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,454
ADVANTAGE.

278
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,207
YOU GUYS CAN HAVE A SEAT.

279
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,250
DAN, YOU JUST BOUGHT AN

280
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,126
ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME.

281
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,377
KEEP IT SEALED.

282
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,587
WHEN YOU GET BACK, OPEN IT IN

283
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:48,838
PRIVATE.

284
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,467
>> THANK YOU.

285
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,135
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

286
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,720
THIS AUCTION IS OVER.

287
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,139
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

288
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:58,347
CAMP.

289
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,224
>> I TOLD MIKE TO GO BEFORE ME.

290
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,809
HE TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK.

291
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,770
AND IT BROKE MY HEART.

292
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,566
AND HE MIGHT HAVE JUST LOST MY

293
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:15,239
TRUST.

294
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,615
>> I'M SO UPSET.

295
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,867
I SPENT $100 TO GET MYSELF OUT

296
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,538
OF THE FOOD AUCTION AND I WAS

297
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,332
LIKE, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

298
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,708
I WAS DEVASTATED.

299
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,752
SO I'M WALKING BACK TO CAMP, AND

300
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,878
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M LIKE,

301
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:33,382
OH, MY GOD, THERE'S A CLUE FOR

302
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:38,679
ME.

303
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,349
WOW.

304
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,019
I JUST GOT A MAP AND IT SAYS,

305
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,021
"TRIBE CAMP" AND IT HAS AN X AND

306
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:47,980
IT SAYS DIG.

307
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,607
THEY'RE PROBABLY GETTING BURGERS

308
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,900
AND FRIES, BUT MAYBE I GOT

309
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,275
SOMETHING WETTER.

310
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,235
IT'S SHOCKING HOW THIS GAME CAN

311
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,362
CHANGE IN YOUR FAVOR JUST LIKE

312
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:54,570
THAT.

313
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,113
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE WORST DAY

314
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,574
EVER, BUT THIS COULD BE HUGE FOR

315
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:08,417
ME.

316
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:24,100
>> OH, MY GOD.

317
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,644
I GOT A NOTE, "YOU BOUGHT

318
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,895
YOURSELF OUT OF THE AUCTION, AND

319
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,980
YOU ALSO BOUGHT YOURSELF A

320
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,941
PERSONAL STASH OF RATION, ENOUGH

321
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,609
TO LAST YOU FOR THE REST OF THE

322
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:33,943
GAME.

323
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,735
THE INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE THE

324
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,490
SHARE, IF ANY, IS UP TO YOU."

325
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:39,949
WOW.

326
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,409
THE BIBLE SAYS IT'S BETTER TO

327
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:45,079
GIVEN THAT RECEIVE, SO EVEN

328
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,498
THOUGH THESE SNACKS ARE FOR ME,

329
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,582
WE'VE ALL BEEN OUT HERE FOR 25

330
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,208
DAYS.

331
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,126
EVERYBODY'S STARVING, SO I'M

332
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,669
GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SHARE.

333
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,212
MAYBE THIS WILL GIVE ME SOME

334
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,672
BROWNIE POINTS WHEN IT COMES TO

335
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,881
PEOPLE TRYING TO VOTE ME OUT, I

336
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,174
DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S

337
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,759
GOING TO BE A NICE GESTURE, NO

338
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:11,021
HARD FEELINGS.

339
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,064
>> CLOSE YOUR EYES.

340
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,816
>> CLOSE YOUR EYES?

341
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,109
>> JENN, READ THAT.

342
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,485
>> YOU BOUGHT YOURSELF OUT OF

343
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,488
THE AUCTION, AND YOU ALSO BOUGHT

344
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,657
YOURSELF A PERSONAL STASH OF

345
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,909
RATION, ENOUGH TO LAST YOU FOR

346
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,286
THE REST OF THE GAME.

347
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,787
>> JENN, GET THE FIRST PIECE OF

348
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,497
THAT JERKY, PLEASE.

349
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,666
>> NO, NO, NO.

350
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,005
HANG ON TO THAT.

351
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,592
>> RODNEY...

352
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,218
>> I SCREWED UP BIG TIME AT THE

353
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:41,469
AUCTION.

354
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,263
BUT I KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN

355
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,764
ALLIANCE FORMED THAT WAS COMING

356
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,725
FOR ME.

357
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,350
AND I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE

358
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,937
AND WATCH IT HAPPEN.

359
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,398
>> BLOW IT UP RIGHT NOW.

360
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,233
>> BECAUSE IF I DON'T OUT THIS

361
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:56,901
ALLIANCE IMMEDIATELY, DAN,

362
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,028
SIERRA AND MYSELF ARE GOING

363
00:12:59,111 --> 00:12:59,195
HOME.

364
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,780
>> THE ONLY REASON WHY I ALMOST

365
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,824
DIDN'T TAKE MY LETTER IS BECAUSE

366
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,993
I KNOW THAT YOU'LL FLIPPED

367
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,412
RODNEY, AND I KNOW AT TOMORROW

368
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,914
NIGHT'S VOTE IS GOING FOUR FOR

369
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,917
ME, AND I KNOW THE FOUR, ONE,

370
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,713
TWO, THREE, AND FOUR.

371
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,797
I KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW OF A

372
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,423
DOUBT.

373
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,049
I'VE HEARD CONVERSATIONS THAT I

374
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,967
WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HEAR.

375
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,596
DAN'S THREE FAMOUS WORDS,

376
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,055
"FLIPPERS NEVER WIN."

377
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,098
GREAT GAME PLAY, RODNEY.

378
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:28,390
HE FLIPPED.

379
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,100
>> I DIDN'T FLIP.

380
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:30,643
WE'RE SITTING RIGHT HERE.

381
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,852
>> YOU FLIPPED.

382
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,895
>> YOU'RE STILL HERE.

383
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,854
WHO DID I FLIP ON?

384
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,898
>> WE'LL SEE TOMORROW NIGHT.

385
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,900
>> YOU WILL SEE, AND YOU'RE

386
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,901
RUINING IT FOR YOURSELF.

387
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,902
WE ALL GOT OUR LOVED LETTERS AND

388
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,028
YOU'RE BRINGING THE MOMENT DOWN

389
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,904
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING NUTS RIGHT

390
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,531
NOW.

391
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,115
YOU BETTER RELAX, BRO.

392
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:45,533
YOU BETTER RELAX.

393
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,785
>> I'M TELLING YOU.

394
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,577
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

395
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,746
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW.

396
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,705
YOU LOST YOUR DAMN MIND.

397
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,334
>> I KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

398
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,419
>> OH, MY GOD.

399
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,098
>> I'M JUST GLAD THEY'RE ALL

400
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,183
HERE.

401
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,643
DON'T BE MAD BECAUSE YOU GOT

402
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:12,893
BUSTED.

403
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,352
>> NOBODY GOT BUSTED.

404
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,896
>> YOU LOST YOUR DAMN MIND.

405
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,856
>> WHEN WE GET BACK FROM THE

406
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,400
REWARD, MIKE'S TELLING ME

407
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,901
THERE'S FOUR AGAINST ME AND DAN,

408
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,070
RODNEY FLIPPED.

409
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:23,904
ON THE BLUE COMERS, SO MIKE

410
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,073
FEELS THE URGE TO JUST LET IT

411
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,366
ALL OUT.

412
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,994
THIS IS A SYMPTOM OF BEING

413
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,954
EXHAUSTED AND PARANOIA AND HE

414
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,622
HAS THE WORST TIMING EVER.

415
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,040
WE HAVE LETTERS FROM OUR LOVED

416
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:35,708
ONES.

417
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,292
WE JUST WANT TO SIT DOWN AND

418
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,585
READ THEM.

419
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,210
I'M DIGGING IN.

420
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,378
I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE.

421
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:39,837
I'M SORRY.

422
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,676
>> DO YOUR THINK, SIERRA.

423
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,385
>> PICTURES.

424
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,387
>> OH, MY GOSH, LOOK AT YOUR

425
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,388
HAIR IN THE PICTURES.

426
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,307
LOOK AT YOUR HAIR.

427
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,935
>> THEY SENT PICTURES OF MY

428
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,231
ANIMALS.

429
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,026
>> REMEMBER, PLAY SMART BUT BE

430
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,069
TRUE TO YOURSELF.

431
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,321
COME HOME SAFE, DAD.

432
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,406
>> I MISS YOU SO MUCH IT HURTS.

433
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,949
ALL MY LOVE.

434
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,243
>> ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DO

435
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,161
APOLOGIZE FOR BRINGING ALL THAT

436
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:12,703
UP.

437
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,623
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT.

438
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,957
I JUST OUTED THE ALLIANCE THAT

439
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,125
WAS TRYING TO GET ME OUT TODAY.

440
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,294
NOW THEY'RE ALL MAD AT ME

441
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,755
BECAUSE I RUINED THE MOMENT.

442
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,339
FOR EVERYBODY.

443
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,423
BUT THIS IS A GAME.

444
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,175
AND I'M HERE TO WIN.

445
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,176
HOPEFULLY MY STRATEGY WORKS.

446
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,054
IT MAY NOT, BUT AT LEAST IT'S

447
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,181
OUT IN THE OPEN NOW.

448
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,850
>> WHAT MIKE WAS SAYING WAS

449
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,727
TRUE, BUT I JUST GOT TO USE IT

450
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,353
TO MY ADVANTAGE, SO I'M GOING

451
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,229
AFTER WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW,

452
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,190
WHICH IS DAN'S VOTE.

453
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:47,196
>> HEY THERE, BIG GUY.

454
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,989
>> LOVE YOU, MAN.

455
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,035
>> THAT WAS SO UNCALLED FOR.

456
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,079
>> YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET YOUR

457
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:55,371
EXPERIENCE.

458
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,539
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT, MAN.

459
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,208
>> HE'S GONE OFF THE DEEP END.

460
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:06,882
>> IF THIS NOT "SURVIVOR," I'D

461
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:07,466
BATTLE MIKE OUT IN THE STREET,

462
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,302
BUT IN "SURVIVOR," I HAVE TO

463
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,179
BEAT HIM WITH MY MIND AND MY

464
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:12,721
WIT.

465
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,181
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID, HE

466
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,224
MADE MY JOB EASY.

467
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,558
THAT'S THE MOST DISRESPECTEDFUL

468
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:16,892
THING.

469
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:17,976
HE DOGGED YOU.

470
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,435
>> I KNOW.

471
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,228
>> HE'S LET THIS GAME TAKE OVER

472
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,480
HIS MIND, BRO.

473
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,523
THAT'S JUST PLAYING LIKE...

474
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,983
>> HE SHOWED HIS COLORS, MAN.

475
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,152
MIKE TOOK A REALLY NICE MOMENT

476
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:27,486
AND RUINED IT.

477
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,446
THAT HURT ME.

478
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,948
BECAUSE MIKE IS MY FRIEND.

479
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,117
BUT HE IS CONVINCED THAT RODNEY

480
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,078
HAS FLIPPED, WHICH NOW PUTS

481
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,122
MIKE, MYSELF AND SIERRA ON THE

482
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,040
BOTTOM END OF THE FOOD CHAIN.

483
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,376
WHO IS RIGHT?

484
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,087
DON'T KNOW.

485
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,717
>> $480 SPOT.

486
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,134
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

487
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:54,179
YOU BOUGHT YOURSELF AN EXTRA

488
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:54,847
VOTE.

489
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,349
WHEN YOU INTEND TO USE THE VOTE,

490
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,144
YOU MUST ANNOUNCE IT AFTER JEFF

491
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,855
SAYS, "I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES."

492
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,190
THIS VOTE WILL COUNT LIKE ANY

493
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:12,281
OTHER AT THAT TRIBAL COUNCIL."

494
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,825
I COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED THIS IN

495
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,618
MY WILDEST DREAMS.

496
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,621
I WAS EXPECTING AN ADVANTAGE IN

497
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,540
THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

498
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,334
BUT TO GET A SECOND VOTE.

499
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,295
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS

500
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,129
MEANS TO ME?

501
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,631
IT'S LIKE THE WILLIE WONKA

502
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,049
GOLDEN TICKET.

503
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,134
OH, MY GOD.

504
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,273
>> YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE

505
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,067
GETTING BACK THE CAMP.

506
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:49,610
>> YES.

507
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,278
>> I WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR

508
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,113
WHAT YOU SHARED.

509
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,282
I JUST THINK THERE'S MORE TO THE

510
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,533
STORY.

511
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,619
HE SAID THAT HE HAD TO DIG DOWN,

512
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,120
OPEN THIS BOX AND THERE WAS ALL

513
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,247
KINDS OF STUFF IN IT, AND HE

514
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,290
BROUGHT IT BACK TO CAMP.

515
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,793
WELL, WHERE'S THE BOX?

516
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,752
>> YEAH.

517
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,462
>> I THINK THERE'S MORE THAN

518
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,839
WHAT HE GAVE US, ABSOLUTELY.

519
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,800
>> SUPPOSEDLY WILL SHARED ALL

520
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:17,387
THE FOOD WITH US.

521
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,680
THESE RATIONS THAT ARE SUPPOSED

522
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,306
TO LAST THE REST OF THE GAME,

523
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,517
WHICH IS A LITTLE SUSPECT TO ME.

524
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,351
>> I WANT THE FIND OUT WHERE HE

525
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:27,231
HID THAT FOOD, MAN.

526
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:34,112
>> HE JUST GAVE US THIS.

527
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,448
>> EVERYBODY'S SPREADING THESE

528
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,574
RUMORS THAT THERE'S MORE FOOD

529
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,285
OUT THERE.

530
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,037
LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO HIDE STUFF

531
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,996
FROM US.

532
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,540
SHIRIN, JENN, MIKE ARE LIKE,

533
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,165
WE'RE GOING TO EXPOSE HIM AND

534
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:45,499
CALL HIM OUT.

535
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,292
>> I JUST HEARD THAT THOSE THREE

536
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,336
ARE SAYING THAT I'M LYING THAT

537
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,129
THERE WAS MORE FOOD AND THAT I'M

538
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,258
HIDING IT, WHICH IS A CROCK.

539
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,220
I'M ALREADY MAD BECAUSE I DIDN'T

540
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,014
GET A LETTER OF MY FAMILY, BUT

541
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,892
WHEN I DO A GENEROUS ACT AND YOU

542
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,353
QUESTION THAT... I CHOSE TO

543
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,938
SHARE THAT WITH YOU GUYS AND YOU

544
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,481
QUESTION THAT.

545
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,149
MISS GREEDY ASS.

546
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,568
ALL YOU'VE BEEN DOING IS RUNNING

547
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,277
YOUR DAMN MOUTH.

548
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,319
SHIRIN, ALL YOU DO IS EAT AND

549
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,445
TALK.

550
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,738
WHAT ELSE CAN FIT IN THERE?

551
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,364
>> DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO SPEAK

552
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,032
TO ME THAT WAY?

553
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,242
>> I AM SPEAKING TO YOU THAT

554
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,785
WAY.

555
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,079
DON'T EVER QUESTION MY

556
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,582
CHARACTER, DOLL, FOR REAL.

557
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,625
WILL CAME BACK TO CAMP FREAKING

558
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,334
OUT.

559
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,128
MIKE WAS MISSING, JENN WAS

560
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:31,879
MISSING.

561
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,505
WILL STARTS TEARING INTO ME LIKE

562
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,840
A CRAZY PERSON.

563
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,551
>> YOU ALL WANT TO TALK, LET'S

564
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:37,759
TALK.

565
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,011
LET'S DO IT, BABY.

566
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,888
>> WHY DON'T YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH

567
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,014
SHUT AND YOU'LL STAY HERE

568
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:42,639
LONGER.

569
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,808
IT'S CRAZY.

570
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,268
>> WHEN YOU GET CALLED OUT,

571
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,353
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

572
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:48,937
YOU DON'T WANT THE HEAR THE

573
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,438
TRUTH.

574
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,898
>> NOBODY EVEN LIKES YOU.

575
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,481
I CAN GUARANTEE THERE'S NOBODY

576
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,317
IN THE UNITED STATES AT HOME

577
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,985
THAT IS MISSION YOU.

578
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,862
>> AND THEN HE JUST STARTED

579
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,780
DIGGING IN WITH THE PERSONAL

580
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:58,989
ATTACKS.

581
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,575
>> WE ALL HAVE LOVED ONES THAT

582
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,576
LOVE AND CARE FOR US.

583
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:02,951
YOU HAVE NOTHING.

584
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,953
>> HAVING GROWN UP IN FAMILY

585
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,413
TORN APART BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

586
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,832
AND THEN VERBALLY ASSAULTED MY

587
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,458
ENTIRE CHILDHOOD, I GET WORKED

588
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,709
UP ABOUT IT.

589
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,794
>> YOU HAVE NOTHING.

590
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,129
YOU HAVE NO FAMILY, YOU HAVE

591
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:14,338
NOTHING.

592
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,422
>> STOP WITH THE PERSONAL

593
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:15,631
ATTACKS.

594
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,381
>> DUDE, I'LL DO WHAT I WANT.

595
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,968
>> HE'S MAN OF GOD, HE PRAYS

596
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,427
BEFORE EVERY MEAL.

597
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,389
>> GOD DON'T LIKE UGLY.

598
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,432
I'M EXPOSING UGLY.

599
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,309
GO ON WITH YOUR LITTLE BITCH

600
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,728
MIKE AND GET THE HELL UP OUT OF

601
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,020
HERE.

602
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,188
>> WHAT?

603
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,272
>> YOU HEARD, BRO.

604
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,233
>> OTHER THAN MIKE, EVERYONE IS

605
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,068
SITTING THERE SMILING LIKE, THIS

606
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:36,485
IS FUN, ISN'T IT.

607
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:43,742
TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN, IT'S

608
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,495
DISGUSTING.

609
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,580
LIKE I HAVE NOBODY IN MY LIFE

610
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,373
WHO LOVES ME AND LIKE HOW I'M

611
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:54,962
LIKE A LOSER AND...

612
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,797
>> WHAT ARE PEOPLE GETTING SO

613
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,133
PERSONAL FOR?

614
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,385
>> THE PAST COUPLE DAYS I

615
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,303
HAVEN'T REALLY WANTED TO BE

616
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:03,595
HERE.

617
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,973
BUT THOSE PEOPLE SUCK SO BAD.

618
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,349
I THINK I'LL STICK AROUND JUST

619
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:11,645
SO I CAN [BLEEPED] UP THEIR

620
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:11,979
GAME.

621
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,356
>> AT THIS POINT ME, SHIRIN AND

622
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,234
JENN, WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER,

623
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,986
BUT WE'RE STILL IN THIS GAME.

624
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,237
AND I'M GOING TO KEEP WORKING

625
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,698
EVERY ANGLE I CAN UNTIL EITHER

626
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:34,334
SOMETHING BREAKS OR I GO HOME.

627
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:50,392
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

628
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,435
HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING 27 DAYS

629
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,437
INTO THIS GAME?

630
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,022
>> PRETTY GOOD.

631
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,023
>> PRETTY GOOD.

632
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,107
>> NOT GOOD.

633
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,191
NOT GOOD.

634
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:58,734
>> Jeff: JUST STRUGGLING?

635
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,986
>> UM, WHEN THEY CAME WITH WITH

636
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,072
THEIR LETERS FROM HOME, IT JUST

637
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,992
HURT.

638
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,537
AND I WAS WONDERING IF I TOOK

639
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,414
MYSELF OUT OF TODAY'S IMMUNITY

640
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,415
CHALLENGE, WHICH PUTS ME AT RISK

641
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,501
OF BEING VOTED OUT AND LOSING $1

642
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,419
MILLION, I'M WILLING TO DO THAT

643
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,214
FOR THOSE LETTERS.

644
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,091
FAMILY MEANS MORE TO ME THAN

645
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:23,300
MONEY.

646
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,886
SO THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

647
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,428
>> Jeff: HERE'S HOW I FEEL

648
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,888
ABOUT IT.

649
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,473
IF EVERYBODY HERE FEELS GOOD

650
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,559
WITH WILL SITTING OUT, THEN WILL

651
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:37,814
CAN SIT OUT AND I'LL HAVE YOUR

652
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,649
LETTER WAITING BACK AT CAMP,

653
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,151
BUT, WILL, IN THE FAIRNESS OF

654
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,611
THIS GAME, THE INTEGHTD OF IT,

655
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,528
EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS TO

656
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:43,904
AGREE.

657
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,363
IF ONE PERSON SAYS, NO YOU CAN'T

658
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:45,822
DO IT.

659
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,157
DOES THAT SEEM FAIR TO YOU?

660
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,825
>> YEAH, THAT'S FAIR.

661
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,284
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

662
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,786
WE'LL DO A SIMPLE SHOWING OF

663
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,536
HANDS.

664
00:22:51,620 --> 00:23:08,970
ANYBODY HERE OBJECT?

665
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,851
>> SHOCKING.

666
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,478
>> Jeff: SHIRIN THE ONLY ONE.

667
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,813
>> HE BOUGHT WHAT HE PRESIDENT

668
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,522
AT THE AUCTION.

669
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,022
HE BOUGHT OUT.

670
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,399
HE MISSED OUT ON THE LOVED ONE'S

671
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,150
LETTERS AND THAT'S THE WAY THE

672
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,277
GAME WORKS.

673
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,320
>> Jeff: WILL, CAN'T DO IT.

674
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,240
>> THAT'S FINE.

675
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,574
SO LET'S DO IT, BABY.

676
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:29,866
LET'S DO IT.

677
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,576
>> Jeff: IMMUNITY.

678
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,536
LET'S GET TO IT THEN.

679
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,955
FIRST THINGS FIRST, TYLER.

680
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:35,497
I'LL TAKE IT BACK.

681
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,750
>> BRING IT TO YOU.

682
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,253
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY

683
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,504

00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,300
TRANSPORT A BALL ACROSS A SERIES

687
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,385
OF TEETER TO THERS.

688
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,594
WHEN YOU REACH THE END, YOU'LL

689
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,929
PLACE THE BALL IN THE STAND AND

690
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:51,596
HEAD BACK.

691
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,431
IF AT ANY POINT YOU FALL OFF OR

692
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,350
THE BALL DROPS, YOU HAVE TO GO

693
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,226
BACK TO THE START.

694
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,811
FIRST PERSON TO PLACE ALL SIX

695
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:01,064

00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,197
AND BECOME THE THIRD MEMBER OF

701
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,949
OUR JURY.

702
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,242
WE'RE GOING THE DRAW FOR SPOTS.

703
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:20,083
WE'LL GET STARTED.

GO!

709
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,719
A SIMPLE-LOOKING CHALLENGE.

710
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,847
THE TONGS ARE VERY HEAVY, AND

711
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,641
IT'S HARD TO BALANCE THAT BALL.

712
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,602
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE THE GUY

713
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,853
WHO DIDN'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE

714
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,605
IS IN THE EARLY LEAD.

715
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,230

WILL DROPS.

717
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,274

00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,114
>> Jeff: DAN DROPS.

723
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,657
A STEEP LEARNING CURVE ON THIS

724
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,283
ONE.

725
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,036
HERE COMES TYLER SLOW AND

726
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,244

728
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,248
TYLER AT HIS STAND.

TYLER HAS HIS FIRST BALL AND IT

730
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,293
IS ON THE STAND.

731
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:03,752
TYLER HEADS BACK.

732
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:08,256
RODNEY DROPS.

733
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,842

734
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,552
THERE GOES DAN AGAIN.

735
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,556
MIKE IS AT HIS STAND.

736
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,645
MIKE HAS HIS FIRST.

737
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,647
>> OH, WHAT IN DAMNATION.

738
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,564
>> Jeff: DAN DROPS.

739
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,149
HE WAS ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

740
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:26,942
DAN'S GOT TO HEAD BACK.

741
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,526
IT IS TYLER WITH ONE, MIKE WITH

742
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,361
ONE.

743
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,695
JENN DROPS.

744
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,281
SHIRIN STILL TRYING TO GET OUT

745
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:33,823

746
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,283
HERE COMES MIKE TRYING TO PICK

747
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:35,700
UP THE PACE.

748
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,662
THERE'S TYLER WITH HIS SECOND.

00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,246
TYLER DROPS.

750
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,872

00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,517
SIERRA HAS HER FIRST.

762
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,186
HERE COMES TYLER.

763
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,688

MIKE NOW WITH HIS THIRD.

MIKE IS SCREAMING ACROSS THIS

768
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,696
COURSE NOW.

769
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,573
HE'S GOT A RHYTHM AND IT IS

770
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:23,373
WORKING.

771
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:23,873
THAT IS THREE FOR MIKE.

772
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:24,499
THERE'S TYLER WITH HIS SECOND.

773
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:24,874

HERE COMES DAN WITH HIS SECOND.

775
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,086

OH, SIERRA DROPS AT THE LAST

777
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:35,593
SECOND.

778
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:35,844
WILL...

779
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,845
>> OH, MY GOD.

780
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,679
>> Jeff: WILL DROPS.

781
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,389
HERE COMES MIKE.

782
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,849
MIKE JUST BARELY CLEARS THAT

783
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,267
SECOND TEETER TOTTER.

784
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,643
MIKE NOW WITH HIS FOURTH.

785
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,186
RIGHT NEXT TO HIM IS TYLER WITH

786
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,729
HIS THIRD.

787
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:50,108
IT IS MIKE AND TYLER RIGHT NOW.

788
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,110
EVERYBODY ELSE WAY BEHIND.

789
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,279
HERE COMES MIKE AND TYLER RIGHT

790
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:54,696
BEHIND HIM.

791
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,490
MIKE HAS A ONE-BALL LEAD RIGHT

792
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,743
NOW.

793
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,369
THAT IS FIFE FOR MIKE IF HE CAN

794
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:01,745
GET IT.

795
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,455
AND HE DOES.

796
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,706
MIKE HEADING BACK FOR HIS SIXTH

797
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,665
AND FINAL BALL.

798
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,833
TYLER WITH HIS FOURTH.

799
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:13,048
IT IS A RACE TO THIS FINISH.

800
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,716
DAN DROPS AGAIN.

801
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,303
TYLER COMING BACK WITH HIS

802
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,388
FIFTH.

803
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:20,722
TYLER DROPS.

804
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,681
GOT TO HEAD BACK.

805
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,849
OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE WIN RIGHT

806
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,142

807
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:28,938
MIKE WITH HIS SIXTH BALL.

808
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,776
TAKING HIS TIME.

809
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,153
FOR IMMUNITY.

810
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,822
MIKE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY!

811
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,992
GUARANTEED A ONE IN EIGHT SHOT

812
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,660
OF WINNING THIS GAME.

813
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,371
>> YEAH, MIKE!

814
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,789
NO ONE ELSE GET TOO EXCITED.

815
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,459
>> THANKS, JENN.

816
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,585
>> I NEEDED IT.

817
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:55,840
I NEEDED IT.

818
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,885
>> Jeff: MIKE, COME ON OVER.

819
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,887
>> JUST WHEN I NEEDED IT MOST,

820
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,346
BABY.

821
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,013
>> Jeff: IS THAT RIGHT?

822
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,140
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

823
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,517
>> Jeff: FIRST INDIVIDUAL

824
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,309
IMMUNITY WIN FOR MIKE.

825
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,852
MIKE CANNOT BE VOTED OUT AT

826
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,104
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

827
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,271
YOU'RE GUARANTEED A 1-8 SHOT IN

828
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,147
THIS GAME.

829
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,149
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 27

830
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,984
DAYS OUT HERE, SOMEBODY WILL BE

831
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,569
VOTED OUT AND BECOME THE THIRD

832
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,738
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

833
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,323
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE AN

834
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,199
INTERESTING AFTERNOON,

835
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,367
ESPECIALLY WITH WILL AND SHIRIN.

836
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,202
>> BRING THE POPCORN, BABY.

837
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,161
IT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST TRIBAL

838
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:25,703
EVER.

839
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,830
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD

840
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,163
BACK TO CAMP.

841
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,207
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

842
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:29,874
>> ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT

843
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,962
COULD HAPPEN IS THAT MIKE WON

844
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,463
IMMUNITY, SO MY GAME HAS TAKE AN

845
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:35,839
HUGE HIT.

846
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,049
THIS CAMP HAS TURNED INTO A DAMN

847
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:38,675
CIRCUS.

848
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,926
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPEN, TRIBAL

849
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,511
AIN'T GOING TO GO EXACTLY HOW WE

850
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,596
WANT IT TO GO.

851
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,945
>> WHEN YOU WIN IMMUNITY, YOU DO

852
00:28:59,028 --> 00:28:59,988
THE HAPPY DANCE.

853
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,741
YOU DO THE HAPPY DANCE WHEN YOU

854
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,159
DO SOMETHING GOOD.

855
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:04,784
IT FELT AMAZING.

856
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,121
AND IT COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A

857
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,165
BETTER TIME IN THIS GAME BECAUSE

858
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:14,836
I WAS 100% ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK

859
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,004
TONIGHT.

860
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,800
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK TODAY?

861
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,888
>> SHOULD WE GET SHIRIN OUT?

862
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,391
>> NO, MAKE HER LIFE MISERABLE.

863
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,517
JENN'S A BIGGER THREAT.

864
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,269
GET RID OF THE THREAT.

865
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,479
SHIRIN'S NOT A THREAT.

866
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,438
TONIGHT'S GOING TO BE A VERY,

867
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,230
VERY IMPORTANT TRIBAL BECAUSE WE

868
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:38,943
NEED TO BRING UP THE NUMBERS.

869
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:44,032
I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE OUT SHIRIN,

870
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,117
SHE HAS NO SOUL, NO WORTH, NO

871
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,619
NOTHING, BUT JENN IS GOOD AT

872
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:47,911
CHALLENGES.

873
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,370
>> I THINK WE SPLIT 3-3.

874
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,872
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT ONE

875
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,040
OF THEM GOES HOME.

876
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:52,373
WE STAY STRONG.

877
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,000
THEN WE DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.

878
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,879
>> THIS IS LIKE SURE VERY --

879
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,963
"SURVIVOR" 101.

880
00:29:59,047 --> 00:29:59,923
WE HAVE SIX STRONG.

881
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:07,347
THEY CAN'T WIN.

882
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,059
>> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:

883
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,062
WOULD YOU RATHER SEE TYLER GO OR

884
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:14,312
MAMA C GO?

885
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,398
>> I WOULD RATHER SEE MAMA C GO

886
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,024
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HER?

887
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,484
>> WOULD YOU THROW THAT VOTE

888
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:19,734
THAT WAY?

889
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,944
>> I WOULD ABSOLUTELY DO THAT.

890
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,154
I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY OF THOSE

891
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:23,988
PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE

892
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:24,239
WINNING.

893
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,615
>> I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

894
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,241
SPLIT THE VOTE BETWEEN JENN AND

895
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,033
ME.

896
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,410
>> THAT'S A GREAT SCENARIO.

897
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:34,249
I'M ABOUT 99% SURE SIERRA'S

898
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:34,832
DONE.

899
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,417
SHE'S BARELY EVEN LOOKING AT ME,

900
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,545
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT DANO.

901
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,130
IF WE DID HAVE DAN, THAT WOULD

902
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,091
GIVE US FOUR.

903
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,552
WE COULD BLINDSIDE MAMA C.

904
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,970
>> AT THIS POINT I WANT THE STAY

905
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,137
IN THIS GAME BECAUSE I DON'T

906
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,722
LIKE THOSE PEOPLE, AND I WANT TO

907
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,890
VOTE THEM OUT, BUT IF THIS IS

908
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,643
GOING TO WORK, IT'S UP TO DAN,

909
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,978
WHO IS DUMB AS A BOX OF ROCKS

910
00:30:55,061 --> 00:31:01,401
SOME MY ENTIRE GAME IS IN DUMB

911
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,987
ASS' HANDS.

912
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,532
>> THOSE FOUR, YOU CAN'T TELL ME

913
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:12,120
YOU DON'T SEE THEM AS TIGHT.

914
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,331
>> I'M TELLING YOU THAT I SAW US

915
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:15,748
ALL TIGHT.

916
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,916
>> MIKE, ALL OF US HAVE TALKED

917
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,876
ABOUT FINAL FIVE, FOUR AND

918
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,127
THREE.

919
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,212
ALL OF US HAVE.

920
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,463
WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT THE END

921
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:22,630
GAME.

922
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,256
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE

923
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,133
GOING TO MAKE THE MOVE EARLY.

924
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,468
>> I THINK THEY THINK THEY HAVE

925
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:27,635
DAN.

926
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,681
>> YEAH.

927
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,599
BUT THEY DON'T GOT DAN.

928
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,809
>> DAN WOULD BE STUPID TO FLIP.

929
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:35,268
>> YEAH.

930
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,269
>> I UNDERSTAND.

931
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,979
AND I PUT YOU GUYS IN THIS

932
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:38,771
POSITION.

933
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,147
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

934
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,608
>> BUT YOU'VE ALIGNED YOURSELF.

935
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,901
>> I HAVE NO CHOICE TO ALIGN

936
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:44,319
MYSELF.

937
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,903
BUT YOU AND SIERRA ARE THE ONLY

938
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,405
TWO THAT I'VE GIVEN MY WORD ON

939
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,240
THAT I WANT TO GO TO THE FINAL

940
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,116
THREE WITH, AND I WOULD STILL

941
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,410
HONOR THAT.

942
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,579
ONE MILLION PER SEPTD BECAUSE WE

943
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,163
ARE BLUE STRONG.

944
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,665
I HAVE BEEN BLUE, BLUE, BLUE

945
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,043
SINCE DAY ONE.

946
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,629
>> THEY'VE BEEN DOWN THERE ALL

947
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:02,879
DAY LONG.

948
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,130
>> WHY IS HE DOING THAT?

949
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,382
>> THE MORE TIME DAN SPENDS WITH

950
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:06,966
THEM, THE MORE DANGEROUS HE

951
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,051
BECOMES.

952
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,261
>> AT THIS POINT I'M LIKE, OH,

953
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,721
MY GOD, IS DAN IN?

954
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,597
IS DAN OUT?

955
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,973
BECAUSE DAN HAS NOT PROVEN

956
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,516
HIMSELF TO BE THAT SMART IN THIS

957
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:15,683
GAME.

958
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,143
BUT I DO HAVE MY IDOL, AND IF

959
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,646
MIKE GETS TO HIM, I MIGHT HAVE

960
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,980
TO USE IT.

961
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,025
>> WHO DO YOU TRUST IN THIS

962
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:24,525
GAME?

963
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,110
RODNEY, WHO IS ALL OF A SUDDEN

964
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,071
EVERYBODY'S BEST FRIEND NOW, WHO

965
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,990
YOU YOURSELF HAVE SAID IS THE

966
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,201
MOST DESPICABLE, VULGAR AND FOUL

967
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:37,830
HUMAN BEING THAT YOU'VE EVER MET

968
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,998
AND WILL ATTACKING A 29-YEAR-OLD

969
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,501
WOMAN, COMING INTO CAMP CALLING

970
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,794
ME A BITCH?

971
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:43,795
I'VE HAD YOUR BACK.

972
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,089
THEY DON'T HAVE YOUR BACK, DAN.

973
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,549
THEY ARE USING YOU.

974
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,929
YOU AND ME BUILT THIS CAMP THAT

975
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,430
WE'RE LIVING AT RIGHT NOW WITH

976
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,016
WITH OUR BARE HANDS.

977
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,518
I'VE SWEATED AND I'VE BLED WITH

978
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:58,768
YOU.

979
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,560
>> ABSOLUTELY.

980
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,438
>> IN THESE TRENCHES.

981
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,856
WHO DO YOU TRUST?

982
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,943
WHO HAS DEVELOPED TRUST WITH

983
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:07,735
YOU?

984
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,986
I GAVE IT MY BEST SHOT.

985
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,196
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL COME

986
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,906
AROUND TO MY WAY OF THINKING OR

987
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:12,115
NOT.

988
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,616
I WOULD LIKE THE THINK DEEP DOWN

989
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,034
IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS DAN DOES

990
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,202
STILL WANT TO WORK WITH ME.

991
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,162
>> WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO VOTE

992
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,580
CAROLYN TONIGHT?

993
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,124
>> IT COULD BE MIKE IS RIGHT.

994
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,418
FOUR OF THEM ARE ABOUT TO SELL

995
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,127
US DOWN THE RIVER.

996
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,130
OR MAYBE HE'S LOST HIS MIND AND

997
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,591
WHAT UPSETS ME THE MOST IS I AM

998
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,259
THE SWING VOTE TONIGHT, WHICH IS

999
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:37,098
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

1000
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,226
>> I'M GOING TO ASK EVERYONE

1001
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,728
AROUND THE CAMPFIRE A QUESTION,

1002
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,271
INCLUDING ME.

1003
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,815
>> I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF PLAYING

1004
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,107
THE GAMES.

1005
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,610
IF I GO WITH THEM, THAT'S MY

1006
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:49,819
CHOICE.

1007
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,114
I MAKE MY OWN DESTINY.

1008
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,491
NOBODY DICTATES MY FUTURE BUT

1009
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:55,658
ME.

1010
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,075
MY CHOICE.

1011
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,161
MY CHOICE, NOT YOURS, NOT YOURS

1012
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,913
AND NOT THEIRS.

1013
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,122
MINE.

1014
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,082
IF I GO AGAINST MIKE AND I'M

1015
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,252
WRONG, I'LL NEVER FORGIVE

1016
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,629
MYSELF, BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY TO

1017
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,089
PUT YOUR EMOTIONS ASIDE BECAUSE

1018
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,549
IT'S A GAME.

1019
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,510
EITHER WAY, IF I'M ABOUT TO MAKE

1020
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,013
A $1 MILLION DECISION OR A $1

1021
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:30,568
MILLION MISTAKE.

1022
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,569
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1023
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:43,164
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1024
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,625
HALI AND JOE VOTED OUT AT THE

1025
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,169
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1026
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,003
ALL RIGHT.

1027
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:51,923
WILL, YOU SAID BRING POPCORN.

1028
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,175
YOU SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE AN

1029
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,009
ENTERTAINING TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1030
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:55,718
>> IT SURE.

1031
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:55,968
IS.

1032
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,385
>> Jeff: I'M READY.

1033
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,013
>> THERE WAS AN INCIDENTS THAT

1034
00:34:59,096 --> 00:34:59,430
HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

1035
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,556
SHIRIN WAS SAYING, YOU HAD ALL

1036
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,225
THIS FOOD, YOU DIDN'T SHARE YOUR

1037
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:02,475
SNACKS.

1038
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,392
>> FALSE, FALSE.

1039
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,061
>> HOW DARE YOU QUESTION ME

1040
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,270
SAYING THAT I'M HIDING FOOD WHEN

1041
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,730
I SHARED IT WITH EACH AND EVERY

1042
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,481
ONE OF YOU.

1043
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,359
SOME PEOPLE I DON'T LIKE.

1044
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,528
AND I DIDN'T GET TO EAT TO THE

1045
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,111
THE AUCTION.

1046
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,613
I DIDN'T GET THE LOVE LETTERS.

1047
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,114
I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS

1048
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,951
WHAT I GOT FOR YOU.

1049
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,118
IT SET ME OFF.

1050
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,954
>> Jeff: YOU EXPLODE.

1051
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,247
>> 150,000% I EXPLODED.

1052
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,376
>> BUT, JEFF, TO BE CLEAR,

1053
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,503
THAT'S NOT WHERE HIS YELLING

1054
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,462
INCIDENT.

1055
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,965
HE SAID TWO THINGS ABOUT THE

1056
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,134
ACTUAL INCIDENT AND HE STARTED

1057
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,885
PERSONALLY ATTACKING ME.

1058
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,345
>> I DIDN'T PERSONALLY ATTACK

1059
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:39,595
YOU.

1060
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,264
>> HE SAID MORE PEOPLE LIKE HIM

1061
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,640
IN THIS GAME THAN IN MY ENTIRE

1062
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:42,849
LIFE.

1063
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,516
>> THAT'S TRUE.

1064
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,184
>> THAT I HAVE NO SOUL, THAT HE

1065
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,644
NEEDS THE PRAY FOR ME, AND IT

1066
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,854
WAS ALL PERSONAL ATTACKS.

1067
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,980
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

1068
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:49,188
GAME.

1069
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,316
IT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ME

1070
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,608
PERSONALLY.

1071
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,402
IT WENT WAY BEYOND THE GAME, AND

1072
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,903
YOU KNOW WHY I DON'T HAVE

1073
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,696
FAMILY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT

1074
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,905
FOR A SECOND, JEFF.

1075
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,866
YEAH, IT'S SO FUNNY AND SO GREAT

1076
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,491
TO PUT ME DOWN FOR NOT HAVING A

1077
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,534
FAMILY.

1078
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,786
I DON'T HAVE FAMILY BECAUSE MY

1079
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,454
BIOLOGICAL FATHER IS JUST LIKE

1080
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,330
YOU, VERBALLY ASSAULTED ME ALL

1081
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:06,581
THE TIME.

1082
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,124
>> I DIDN'T VERBALLY ASSAULT

1083
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:08,291
YOU.

1084
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:08,583
>> SHUT UP!

1085
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,418
>> I JUST CALLED YOU OUT.

1086
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,711
>> YOU VERBALLY ASSAULTED ME.

1087
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,462
>> YOU GET CALLED OUT, YOU PLAY

1088
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:13,880
THE VICTIM.

1089
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,632
>> AND I AM A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC

1090
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,508
VIOLENCE, AND THIS IS WHY OUR

1091
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,093
FAMILY WAS TORN APART, AND THAT

1092
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,845
IS WHY I DO NOT HAVE FAMILY AT

1093
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,470
HOME, AND HE IS MAKING LIGHT OF

1094
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:21,679
THAT.

1095
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,347
>> I AIN'T MAKING LIGHT OF THAT

1096
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,434
WHILE A WHOLE SLEW OF PEOPLE

1097
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,021
JUST WATCH LIKE IT'S

1098
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,355
ENTERTAINMENT.

1099
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,401
>> Jeff: SHIRIN, IS THE

1100
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,193
LAUGHTER RELEASE?

1101
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,403
>> YES.

1102
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,115
>> Jeff: EVEN A LITTLE BIT

1103
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:41,365
CATHARTIC?

1104
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:41,616
>> YES.

1105
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,244
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1106
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,371
SIERRA, TRY TO GIVE ME A PICTURE

1107
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,372
OF WHERE WE ARE FROM THIS

1108
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,540
STANDPOINT.

1109
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,375
FOUR BLUE COLLARS, THREE WHITE

1110
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,419
COLLARS, TWO NO COLLARS, HOW

1111
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,295
DOES EVERYBODY'S INDIVIDUAL

1112
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,381
POINT OF VIEW TOWARD LIFE IMPACT

1113
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,508
THE GAME ON DAY 27.

1114
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,677
>> JEFF, I THINK IT SAYS IT BEST

1115
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,762
BY WE ARE WORLDS APART.

1116
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,305
YOU CAN COMPLETELY FORGET HOW

1117
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,473
THIS GAME STARTED BECAUSE WE ARE

1118
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,517
NINE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

1119
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,268
DEPRIVED, STARVING, WANTING $1

1120
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,103
MILLION.

1121
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,313
WE'RE ALL FIGHTING FOR OURSELVES

1122
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,773
AT THIS POINT.

1123
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,775
>> Jeff: DAN, THE BLUE-COLLAR

1124
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,276
TRIBE IN PARTICULAR WAS VERY

1125
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:17,610
TIGHT.

1126
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,071
THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK OF

1127
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,364
LOYALTY, THIS IS HOW

1128
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:21,822
BLUE-COLLARS BEHAVE.

1129
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,032
DOES THAT MAKE IT TOUGH FOR YOU

1130
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,658
TO BE IN A SITUATION IN WHICH

1131
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,620
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO VOTE AGAINST A

1132
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:27,912
BLUE-COLLAR?

1133
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,746
>> IT'S VERY TOUGH.

1134
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,165
AS A FAN, YOU THINK TO YOURSELF,

1135
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,458
I CAN PARK MY EMOTIONS.

1136
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,877
I CAN COME OUT HERE AND PUT THEM

1137
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,086
ASIDE.

1138
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,671
THAT'S CRAP.

1139
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,090
THAT'S ABSOLUTE CRAP.

1140
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:39,507
YOU GET OUT HERE.

1141
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,424
YOU GET TO KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

1142
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:45,972
YOU MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH THESE

1143
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:46,180
PEOPLE.

1144
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,474
WE'VE BONDED OVER A LIFESTYLE.

1145
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,726
>> Jeff: MIKE, WITH YOUR

1146
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,978
IMMUNITY WIN TODAY, YOU SAID,

1147
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,603
NEVER NEEDED IT MORE THAN I NEED

1148
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,646
IT TODAY.

1149
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,772
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1150
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,607
THESE PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED THAT

1151
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,485
I'M A MASSIVE THREAT IN THIS

1152
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,236
GAME.

1153
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,197
BUT THERE'S A FOUR-CORE ALLIANCE

1154
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,243
RIGHT NOW, RODNEY, MAMA C, TYLER

1155
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:07,618
AND WILL.

1156
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,245
THOSE FOUR WILL WALK TO THE END

1157
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,706
OF THIS GAME.

1158
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,540
SIERRA, DAN, YOU TWO ARE GOING

1159
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,293
HOME FIFTH AND SIXTH.

1160
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,878
>> Jeff: RODNEY, YOU WANT IT,

1161
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,295
YOU WANT IT.

1162
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,381
>> BECAUSE THIS MANIAC AT THE

1163
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,757
AUCTION ALMOST MADE IT SO DAN,

1164
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,508
TYLER AND CAROLINE COULDN'T GET

1165
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,760
THEIR LOVE LETTERS BECAUSE HE

1166
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,637
TOOK HIS $20 BACK.

1167
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,306
>> THEY STILL GOT THEIR LETTERS.

1168
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:28,723
>> LET ME FINISH.

1169
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,058
>> THEN WHEN WE'RE ABOUT TO OPEN

1170
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,102
UP OUR LETTERS, THIS IS AN

1171
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:33,519
ALLIANCE.

1172
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,146
THIS DUDE JUST WENT OFF IN A

1173
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,147
MANIC STATE AND THAT'S WHY HE'S

1174
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,315
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

1175
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,399
SO I DON'T CARE WHAT HE HAS TO

1176
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,150
SAY NO MORE.

1177
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,236
I WAS GOING TO KEEP IT COOL, BUT

1178
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:45,197
I'LL COME AT YOU WITH FACTS.

1179
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:45,823
EVERYBODY'S NODDING BECAUSE THEY

1180
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,826
KNOW IT'S REAL.

1181
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:52,705
>> Jeff: WOW.

1182
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,497
SHIRIN, DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

1183
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,623
GOING TO GET VOTES TONIGHT.

1184
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,499
>> YES.

1185
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,917
I THINK 2 PLAN IS TO SPLIT THE

1186
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,461
VOTES BETWEEN JENN AND ME SINCE

1187
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,546
MIKE HAS IMMUNITY.

1188
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:04,383
>> Jeff: SO YOU THINK IT'S SIX

1189
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,469
VERSUS THREE.

1190
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,889
>> I THINK IT'S FOUR PLUS TWO

1191
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,390
VERSUS THREE.

1192
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,434
>> Jeff: CAROLYN, YOU'RE

1193
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,727
SHAPING YOUR HEAD.

1194
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,773
>> WHEN YOU HAVE SIX STRONG AND

1195
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,316
YOU'RE PICKING OUT THE OTHER

1196
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,400
ALLIANCE, IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

1197
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,860
THEY'RE IN THE PART OF THE SIX.

1198
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,362
>> Jeff: DAN, DO THE TENSIONS

1199
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,947
FALL ON DEAF EAR, OR DO YOU HAVE

1200
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,240
TO LISTEN AND GO THROUGH IT AND

1201
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,492
THINK, OKAY, LET ME THINK ABOUT

1202
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:29,784
THIS ONE.

1203
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,328
>> I'D BE STUPID NOT TO LISTEN.

1204
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,579
YOU HAVE TO WEIGH OUT YOUR

1205
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,538
OPTIONS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST

1206
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,749
ABOUT GETTING TO THE END OF THE

1207
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:37,249
GAME.

1208
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,709
AT THIS STAGE, IT'S HOW YOU GET

1209
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,502
TO THE END OF THE GAME.

1210
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:48,010
AND IT'S WHO YOU PUT OVER THERE.

1211
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:48,636
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1212
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,137
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1213
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:59,480
TYLER, YOU'RE UP.

1214
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:10,699
>> YOU'RE A FIRECRACKER, JENN.

1215
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,331
>> JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERY

1216
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:18,249
SINGLE SEASON OF "SURVIVOR"

1217
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:18,833
DON'T MEAN YOU CAN PLAY THE

1218
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:26,632
GAME, SISTER.

1219
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,645
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1220
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:43,274
VOTES.

1221
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,067
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1222
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:45,693
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1223
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:52,867
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1224
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:56,287
OKAY.

1225
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:56,871
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1226
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,289
DECISION IS FINAL.

1227
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,665
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1228
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,333
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1229
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:01,625
IMMEDIATELY.

1230
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,586
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1231
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:09,049
FIRST VOTE, JENN.

1232
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,759
SHIRIN.

1233
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,177

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,762
TWO VOTES JENN.

1235
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:14,221

1236
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:19,226
THAT'S TWO SHIRIN.

1237
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,061

CAROLYN.

1239
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:27,693
SHIRIN.

1240
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,445
THAT'S THREE VOTES SHIRIN, THREE

THAT'S FOUR VOTES JENN.

1244
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,832
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

1245
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,667
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY, JENN.

1246
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:56,764
YOU NEED TO BRING MY YOUR TORCH.

1247
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:01,143
JENN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1248
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:01,894
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1249
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,354
>> BYE, GUYS.

1250
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,899
GOOD LUCK, AND PLAY NICE, ALL

1251
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:07,483
RIGHT?

1252
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:07,900
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

1253
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:12,988
>> LOVE YOU.

1254
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,281
>> Jeff: WELL, THE GOOD NEWS

1255
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,783
IS YOU'VE MADE IT THIS FAR.

1256
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,910
THE BAD NEWS IS YOU'RE LEFT WITH

1257
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,287
EIGHT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PLAY SO

1258
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,165
BADLY THEY WILL STOP AT NOTHING

1259
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:23,999
TO WIN.

1260
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:24,792
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1261
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,167
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1262
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:30,673
GOOD NIGHT.

1263
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,305
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR

1264
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,224
NEXT EPISODE.

1265

>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,146
"SURVIVOR"...

1267
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,815
>> YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE OF A

1268
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,317
THREAT NOW.

1269
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,319
>> MIKE IS RUNNING OUT OF

1270
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:52,569
ALLIES.

1271
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,281
>> I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

1272
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,282
I'M PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.

1273
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:56,865
>> WHILE TYLER TURNS ON ONE OF

1274
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:57,449
HIS OWN.

1275
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,617
>> GAME ON.

1276
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,078
I GRABBED DAN'S BAG.

1277
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:01,870
HE GETS AN EXTRA VOTE.

1278
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:10,379
>> WOW.

1279
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:15,217
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE SUCK SUPER

1280
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,678
HARD.

1281
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,305
WILL, MAN.

1282
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,641
I HATED RODNEY AND MAMA C.

1283
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,726
I CAN'T WAIT THE WATCH THE REST

1284
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,894
OF THIS TRIBE DESTROY EACH

1285
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:26,478
OTHER.

1286
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,771
I JUST HOPE THEY'RE NOT ON THE

1287
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,856
JURY ANY TIME SOON SO I DON'T

1288
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:29,940
HAVE TO SEE THEIR FACES.
