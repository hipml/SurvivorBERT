00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,502
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,129
<i>Survivor:</i> Both tribes were

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,923
hammered hard by wind and rain.

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:07,590
>> I have never in my life been

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,300
this cold, had my hands this

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,343
destroyed, and my feet look so

7
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:16,057
miserable.

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:16,433
We're freezing.

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,686
>> PROBST: But with their huge

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,730
lead in numbers and rewards--

11
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,273
>> That looks so good.

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,607
>> PROBST: Galu still had plenty

13
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,233
of reason to celebrate.

14
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,485
>> After I finish this, I'll

15
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,236
take the whole team by myself.

16
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,530
>> PROBST: The only storm Galu

17
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,490
couldn't weather was Shambo.

18
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,533
>> Escaped chicken, escaped

19
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,284
chicken.

20
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,661
9-1-1.

21
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,079
>> Shambo is just a complete

22
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,998
Gilligan who just messes things

23
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,500
up all the time.

24
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,377
>> PROBST: On her second visit

25
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,879
to the Foa Foa tribe, it became

26
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,797
clear these were Shambo's real

27
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,173
friends.

28
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,258
>> I am really, really happy to

29
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,635
be over here with Foa Foa.

30
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,678
>> PROBST: Russell, on the

31
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,096
other hand, had no friends,

32
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,347
only targets.

33
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,600
>> Marisa threatened me, Betsy

34
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,018
threatened me-- each time

35
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,478
somebody threatened me, they're

36
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:01,811
going home.

37
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,229
>> PROBST: and when Liz

38
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:03,980
confronted Russell.

39
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:04,981
>> You are lying to me.

40
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,065
>> I'm telling you the truth.

41
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,941
Are you telling me I'm not

42
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,692
honest?

43
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,443
>> PROBST: She became next on

44
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,235
his hit list.

45
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,862
But after Liz's strong effort

46
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,238
in another loss-- Galu wins

47
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,407
immunity.

48
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,200
Russell put his vendetta

49
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,702
against her on the back burner

50
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,953
in order to jettison the

51
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,163
tribe's weakest member, Ashley.

52
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,123
>> It's because of me you're

53
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,249
going home.

54
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,584
I'm out here playing for

55
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,752
$1 million.

56
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,337
Never trust me.

57
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,631
>> PROBST: With only five Foa

58
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,674
Foa left, Liz needs a miracle

59
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,258
to save herself from Russell's

60
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,094
cruel intentions, assuming they

61
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,138
can all survive the conditions.

62
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,890
14 are left.

63
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,601
Who will be voted out tonight?

64
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,484
(thunder crashing)

65
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,579
>> Are you shaking?

66
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:01,830
>> Yeah.

67
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,331
>> You're that cold?

68
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,001
I mean, I'm cold, too, but

69
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:07,919
geez.

70
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,962
>> okay, Mick's having a

71
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:09,879
seizure over here.

72
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,964
He's epileptic.

73
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,217
>> Since day ten, this is day

74
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,302
15 now, we're getting soaked at

75
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,220
night.

76
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,638
It's cold.

77
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,931
So, it's been pretty bad for

78
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,058
the last several nights.

79
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,894
I'll be honest, like there was

80
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,395
some envy last night when

81
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,230
Ashley went home.

82
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,149
There was a little tinge of

83
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:29,899
jealousy there.

84
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,486
I was like, "Oh, man," you know?

85
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,696
>> I really think we got

86
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,905
another two days of this, three

87
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:43,997
days, something.

88
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,957
>> I used to watch this cartoon

89
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,083
when I was growing up called

90
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,334
<i>Captain Planet,</i> and there was

91
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,461
always that one guy with the

92
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,921
ring, heart, and we always make

93
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,923
fun of him.

94
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,632
Like, "What is heart?"

95
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,717
Everybody else gets a real

96
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,885
element and you get heart."

97
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,844
And I really wish I had that

98
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,012
heart ring right now.

99
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,471
Because I'm tired, I'm really

100
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,390
hungry, and I'm sitting here

101
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,100
trying to battle what seems to

102
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,394
be a battle that fate just

103
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,021
doesn't want us to win.

104
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,731
What do you think?

105
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,773
Yeah.

106
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,691
>> It's not bad.

107
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,986
>> It's not bad.

108
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,780
>> This is the man test.

109
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,948
>> If it takes seven days and

110
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,783
seven nights of rain for one

111
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,328
person to quit, I'll take it.

112
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,123
Hell, yeah, I'm having fun.

113
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,166
I'm out in the rain.

114
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,168
This is how I want it to be.

115
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,419
That sunny days we had for nine

116
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,754
days, I was like, "Man, this is

117
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,756
too pretty.

118
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,299
I'd take my family here."

119
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,634
I want to be somewhere where I

120
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,843
can't take my family, where

121
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,303
it's miserable.

122
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,429
>> (laughing)

123
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:45,224
>> What's wrong, man?

124
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,392
>> I'm so freaking cold right

125
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,062
now, it's ridiculous.

126
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,356
>> So silly.

127
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,817
>> I'm freezing!

128
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,443
>> Come on, man.

129
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,362
You can take this.

130
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,364
It's just a little water.

131
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,865
Man.

132
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,409
>> This isn't even right.

133
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,370
>> They're going to be soaking

134
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,372
wet, whether it stops raining

135
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,248
or not stops raining.

136
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,124
Tonight, they're going to be

137
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,834
wet, so this is really no big

138
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,335
deal.

139
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,712
As a matter of fact, this makes

140
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:20,301
me stronger.

141
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,428
(theme song playing)

142
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:02,236
(thunder rumbling)

143
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,539
(thunder crashing)

144
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,391
>> A what?

145
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:32,767
>> It's raining.

146
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,476
People are miserable.

147
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,021
Spirits are down.

148
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,649
And it could all be alleviated

149
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,819
had Russell gotten us that tarp.

150
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,444
But it's just the way the game

151
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,446
goes sometimes.

152
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,824
You know, one person is elected

153
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,992
to make decisions for the group.

154
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,285
Sometimes, it puts you in a

155
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,328
worse position than you would

156
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,371
have been if you were making

157
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:53,996
those decisions for yourself.

158
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,917
(thunder crashing)

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,627
>> Welcome to Samoa, brother.

160
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,588
Rain doesn't stop.

161
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,723
Russell's an animal.

162
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,351
>> Where is he?

163
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:16,435
>> Right there.

164
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:16,894
>> Oh, yeah.

165
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,063
>> Russell was out working on

166
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:19,689
the fire while every single one

167
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,649
of us was huddled up trying to

168
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,693
stay warm, just trying to keep

169
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,111
sane, and he's out there just

170
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,113
busting his butt.

171
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,282
For me to see that, you know,

172
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,575
it's awesome to see him push

173
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,201
himself, but, also, like, you

174
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,494
know, it's great that you're

175
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,579
out there doing it, but at the

176
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,705
same time, it's like, no one

177
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,417
expects you to do that.

178
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,543
You know, it might have been to

179
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,627
a point where it was a bit

180
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,795
unnecessary and went a little

181
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,464
bit too far.

182
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:45,882
>> You know what?

183
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,550
There's no reason to be

184
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,677
sitting out here right now.

185
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:51,929
>> I'd rather be in the

186
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,514
shelter, but sometimes you have

187
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,683
to make some deposits in case

188
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,143
you need any withdrawals later

189
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,686
on.

190
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,854
You know, the chief thing

191
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,230
counter-balances to the

192
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,232
negative, so just trying to

193
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,901
keep the fire burning.

194
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,111
This is buying stock low.

195
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:07,737
Hopefully I'll be able to sell

196
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,739
high later.

197
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,536
>> Fire looks good though, huh?

198
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,579
>> I just got a chill.

199
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,458
Hold on.

200
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,751
>> Careful, careful, careful!

201
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,960
>> Are you okay?

202
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,295
>> Just hand me my jacket.

203
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:24,795
Just hand me my jacket.

204
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,588
>> Here you go.

205
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,341
>> Goodness!

206
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,634
Oh, that sucked.

207
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,844
That sucked.

208
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,346
>> Russell's definitely got

209
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,055
this, like, stubborn

210
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:34,931
determination to do everything.

211
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,681
But truth is, like, the

212
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,265
elements out here, like, it's

213
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,642
going to break you down.

214
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,852
He's just pushing himself too

215
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,437
hard and it's going to take its

216
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,439
toll, you know.

217
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:44,023
>> I can go back out there.

218
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,650
I just got to get my body

219
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,777
temperature back up.

220
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,872
(thunder crashing)

221
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,893
>> I probably look like some

222
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,603
crazy person, but basically,

223
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,689
this spot actually is a pretty

224
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,691
good cover.

225
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,944
I can kind of-- with my body

226
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,529
heat, kind of keep this corner

227
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,531
a little bit warm.

228
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,408
The shelter has so many gaps in

229
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,034
it, that when it rains this

230
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,160
hard, it just pours right

231
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,578
through.

232
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,663
I can't wear my clothes because

233
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,290
they're all soaking wet.

234
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,167
So I'm just doing the best I

235
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,544
can at just trying to stay

236
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,962
semi-warm and out of the rain

237
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,089
and...

238
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,801
Just trying to get through this.

239
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,519
>> It's wet.

240
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,061
They don't want to get out.

241
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:04,645
Where are they all from, New

242
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,439
York City?

243
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,942
"Got to stay dry.

244
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,279
Can't get my hair wet."

245
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,406
Man, this is crazy.

246
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,877
>> You never know, man, they

247
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,628
might also sucking each other's

248
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,464
thumbs because they're just a

249
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,131
bunch of babies.

250
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:32,923
That's why we lose the

251
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,925
challenges because they're lazy.

252
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,719
They give up.

253
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,096
They start walking, they start,

254
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,098
"I'm too tired."

255
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,100
Don't stop until you throw up,

256
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:43,726
you pass out, something.

257
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,686
If you don't throw up after

258
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,771
every frickin' challenge, you

259
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,064
didn't do your job.

260
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,149
That's how I think of it.

261
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,693
Now, it was freezing last night,

262
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,862
wet, cold.

263
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,947
It's time to do something about

264
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,574
it today, but they don't want

265
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,033
to.

266
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,910
They want to sit there and suck

267
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,203
on their thumbs.

268
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,579
So I don't know how to help

269
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,372
them.

270
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,623
I don't think it's going to

271
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,750
stop raining.

272
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,299
(thunder rumbling)

273
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,856
>> (groans)

274
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,901
I had been in my hole for, you

275
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,861
know, almost 26 straight hours

276
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,946
of rain, and I was laying in

277
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,782
the hole and I was, like, "Okay,

278
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,784
I give in. We give in.

279
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,910
We understand your greatness.

280
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,079
We understand your power.

281
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,956
And if you are kind to us, I

282
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,582
promise we will speak of your

283
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:48,916
mercy."

284
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,876
And less than 12 hours later, I

285
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,128
wake up from my hole, and not

286
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,629
only is it blue skies, but the

287
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,255
most beautiful rainbow you have

288
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,173
ever seen.

289
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,676
It's as if Samoa said, "That's

290
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,802
all I wanted to hear, Erik.

291
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,804
Just know I'm the man, you're

292
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,055
not.

293
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,640
Now that we got that clear,

294
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,058
enjoy yourself for the next 24

295
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,144
days."

296
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,895
I'm so happy.

297
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,188
>> That's a nice sign, isn't it?

298
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,356
>> That's a real nice sign.

299
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,691
I don't think they have a

300
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,900
rainbow on Foa Foa's side of

301
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,192
the island.

302
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,861
>> A rainbow.

303
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,112
That is really, really nice to

304
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,156
wake up to.

305
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,240
I mean, getting a ray of

306
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,367
sunshine today was like-- you

307
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,453
talk about lifting spirits.

308
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,245
You know, winning challenges

309
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,371
and rewards-- nothing beat this

310
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,373
morning.

311
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,708
>> Look at that!

312
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,750
>> I feel like we just got off

313
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,877
of Noah's Ark.

314
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,504
>> There actually is a sky out

315
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,506
there other than just clouds.

316
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,717
Can you believe it?

317
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:39,925
Look!

318
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,011
There's blue sky out there!

319
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,263
I think going through a storm

320
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,431
like this, I think it

321
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,390
definitely brings the tribe

322
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,892
together, 'cause we weathered

323
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,226
it all together.

324
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,728
Now that we're out, we know

325
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,730
we've got a task at hand, and

326
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,482
we're stronger than ever.

327
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,525
I mean, we really are.

328
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,742
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

329
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,875
Galu, getting your first look at

330
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,794
the new Foa Foa tribe.

331
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,630
Ashley voted out at the last

332
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,424
Tribal Council.

333
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,008
All right, you guys ready to

334
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,427
get to today's challenge?

335
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,178
>> Yes.

336
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,221
>> PROBST: For today's

337
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,347
challenge, one person from each

338
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,265
tribe will be strapped into a

339
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,518
large sphere.

340
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,143
That person will then guide two

341
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,146
blindfolded tribe mates as they

342
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,022
push the sphere through a long

343
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,901
course to a table maze.

344
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,402
The person inside the sphere

345
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,571
will then guide the rest of

346
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,114
their blindfolded tribe mates

347
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,824
as they navigate a ball through

348
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,452
a table maze to a finish hole.

349
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,036
First tribe to get it right

350
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,079
wins reward.

351
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,872
Want to know what you're

352
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,831
playing for?

353
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,082
>> Yes!

354
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,833
>> PROBST: Pizza!

355
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,461
Hot, piping pizza.

356
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,796
You guys have been enduring a

357
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,088
lot of rain.

358
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,465
A nice, hot pizza will go down

359
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,007
really good, right?

360
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,093
>> Yes, sir.

361
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,303
>> PROBST: There's one twist--

362
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,099
win or lose, both tribes going

363
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,934
to Tribal Council.

364
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,269
Both tribes will vote somebody

365
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,355
out tonight.

366
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,149
You'll enjoy the pizza tonight

367
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,067
when the winning tribe sits in

368
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,110
on the losing tribe's Tribal

369
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,486
Council.

370
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,405
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

371
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,406
>> PROBST: So, not only will

372
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,615
you see what is going on within

373
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,157
the tribe, you will do it by

374
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,076
enjoying pizza in front of them.

375
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,206
All right, Galu, you have four

376
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,666
extra members, sitting four

377
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,875
people out.

378
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,459
Who's going to sit out this

379
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,086
challenge?

380
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,136
>> You know, I feel weaker as

381
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,971
the days go on, but I'm the

382
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,140
leader.

383
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,683
I got to go forward.

384
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,142
I can't look back.

385
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,977
And I'm playing the game.

386
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,817
Monica, Kelly, Shambo, Dave.

387
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,776

Everybody else, give you a

00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,279
minute to strategize.

391
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,947
We'll get started.

For Galu, it's Laura in the

396
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,625
ball; Russell and Erik doing

397
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,792
the pushing.

00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,752
Here we go!

To your left!

408
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,097
Good, good, good.

409
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:32,389
Keep going.

410
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,807
They're behind us.

412
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,605

their ball right into Erik.

415
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,276
They're on top of Erik.

416
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,235
>> Straight, straight.

>> PROBST: Foa Foa trying to

418
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,987
sneak around the right.

419

Liz does it.

420
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,657
Foa Foa now in the lead.

421
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,950

00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,452
To your right.

Foa Foa now trying to go around

433
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,594
them again.

434
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,137
>> Hold it. Now forward.

435
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,013
>> PROBST: They are side by

436
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,098

Under the side, Russell!

00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,238
Hold on, hold on.

447
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,322
>> One short turn.

448
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,490
Perfect, now bring it home.

449
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,116
We're almost there.

450
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,909
>> PROBST: Foa Foa very close.

451
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:34,201
Galu stuck.

452
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,120
>> Come on, Galu!

453
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,121
Laura, direct them, Laura, we

454
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,789
can't hear you!

455
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,916
>> Russell, go, go, push, push.

456
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,292
>> PROBST: Russell is exhausted.

457
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,168
>> Russell, push.

458
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,253
>> I'm pushing.

459
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,671
>> There you go, one more.

460
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,714
Okay, now--

461
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,881
>> PROBST: Foa Foa.

462
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,549
You're good.

463
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,425
Now you've got to orient Liz so

464
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:49,717
she can see.

465
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,551
>> Upright.

466
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,594
>> Yeah, pull up. Pull up

467
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,178
>> Towards me!

468
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,681
Russ, Russ, harder, push harder.

469
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,849
>> PROBST: Russell, Erik, and

the finish.

472
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,395
>> Okay, now, get into your

00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,438
positions.

474
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
>> PROBST: Liz, happy where she

475
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,189
is.

476
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,232
>> Go, go, go.

477
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,068
Keep going, come on, Russ!

478
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,194

Galu has their ball in the

481
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,449
right spot.

482
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,199
Erik gets crushed in the end.

483
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,410
>> Get to your spots!

484
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,453
>> Mick, go...

485
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,620
>> PROBST: Galu put Laura in

486
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,538
great position.

487
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,415
No extra orientation needed.

488
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,833
>> Left, left, left, to your

00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,170
left, left, left, left.

490
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:26,587
Left, Russ, left.

491
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,548
>> Hold on. Stop.

492
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,507
>> Russell.

493
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,258
>> Russell!

494
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,342

He is exhausted.

498
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,473
>> Don't fall.

499
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,599
>> PROBST: He has no idea where

500
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,224
he's at right now.

down.

508
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,608
>> Straight down.

509
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,233
>> PROBST: Foa Foa now has a bit

510
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,360
of a lead on the table maze.

511
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,695
>> Brett, down.

512
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,863
Brett down!

513
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,155
John, up.

514
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,992
The ball is right in the middle.

515
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,368
>> Don't move. Don't move.

516
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:58,660
Don't move!

517
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,538
Stop moving. Stop moving!

Hold up, hold up, hold up.

Medical!

527
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,847
Hold where you are.

528
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,682
Everybody, hold where you are.

00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,601
>> Hold it, hold it, Galu.

530
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,393
Hold it right here.

531
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,144
>> PROBST: Hold right where you

00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,229
are.

533
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,856
>> Yeah, yeah.

534
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,191
I'm good.

535
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,818
>> PROBST: He-- he was out.

536
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,902
He was definitely out.

537
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,861
>> Yeah, I saw that.

538
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,403
>> Russell, can you sit down

539
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,822
for a moment?

540
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:35,447
>> PROBST: Yeah, yeah, take

541
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,156
over.

542
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,199
>> Russell, sit down.

543
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,661
Russell.

544
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,204
Lie him down.

545
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:47,084
Can you get the last pack?

546
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,419
>> Russell, can you hear me?

547
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,218
>> Come on, Russ.

548
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:56,969
>> Russ?

549
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,386
Russ, talk to me.

550
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,262
Can someone get me that life

551
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,638
pack?

552
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,764
>> Danielle, can you get the

553
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,433
life pack?

554
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,726
>> Russell passed out during

555
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,602
the challenge.

556
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,728
I mean, I saw him stumbling

557
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,187
around, staggering.

558
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,272
And I figured it was because he

559
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,274
was blindfolded.

560
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,525
I couldn't figure out exactly

561
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:11,900
what was going on.

562
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,235
I should have guessed he passed

563
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,279
out.

564
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,781
>> Russell, you can hear me?

565
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,991
>> I'm good.

566
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,992
Let's go.

567
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,451
Let's go.

568
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,452
>> PROBST: You passed out for a

569
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,328
minute.

570
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:23,871
You weren't with us for a

571
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:24,413
second.

572
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,330
Just relax and let them do what

573
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,583
they're doing.

574
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,042
Everybody, you can take off

575
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,211
your blindfolds.

576
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,550
>> Your blood pressure is really

577
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,759
low too, Russ.

578
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,094
I'm just going to have a listen

579
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,221
to your heart there.

580
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,641
>> I'm cool.

581
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,767
I mean, I was a little winded

582
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,810
from pushing the ball, but I'm

583
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,644
good.

584
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,729
>> You just need to relax just

585
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,565
for a little while, okay?

586
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,612
>> PROBST: Ramona, what's the

587
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,030
update?

588
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,072
>> His blood pressure is even

589
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,450
lower than Mike's was.

590
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,119
If we stood him up now, he'd

591
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:05,203
just black out and collapse

592
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,663
again.

593
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,456
>> PROBST: All right, here's--

594
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,582
here's what's going to happen.

595
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,625
I'm going to make a call right

596
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,126
now, which is this challenge is

597
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,377
over.

598
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,463
Neither tribe wins reward.

599
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,382
Both tribes will go to Tribal

600
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,425
Council tonight.

601
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,843
Both tribes will vote somebody

602
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,344
out tonight.

603
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,386
You're going to both head back

604
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,429
to camp.

605
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,430
We'll stay here and monitor

606
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,932
Russell.

607
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:25,515
If he's able to return to the

608
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,893
game, you'll see him at Tribal

609
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,144
Council.

610
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:29,728
Foa Foa, grab your stuff, head

611
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,730
on out.

612
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,192
>> Feel better, Russell.

613
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,693
>> PROBST: All right, Galu,

614
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,653
grab your stuff.

615
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,320
Head back to camp.

616
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,197
>> We'll be waiting for you,

617
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,614
Russ. Get better.

618
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,531
>> We'll see you back there.

619
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,115
>> PROBST: Either way, we'll

620
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:42,658
see you tonight at Tribal

621
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,700
Council.

622
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,161
>> Hang tight, chief.

623
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,509
>> If he comes back, I will be

624
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,510
shocked.

625
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,595
I'll be happy, but I'll be

626
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,139
shocked.

627
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,266
>> You think Russ is okay?

628
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,768
>> No.

629
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,894
>> You don't think he's coming

630
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,436
back?

631
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,646
>> No.

632
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,106
But I'm not a doctor, I don't

633
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,233
know.

634
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,404
>> Everyone's concerned about

635
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,406
Russell.

636
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,407
For Russell to go down the way

637
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,617
he did today, it shows you how

638
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,619
tough this game is.

639
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,496
No one has any experience with

640
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,123
this level of dehydration.

641
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,332
No one has any experience with

642
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,542
the level of malnutrition that

643
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,584
we go through.

644
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,627
And a guy like Russell gives

645
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,670
you everything he's got and

646
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,130
more every single time, and

647
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:38,714
then he comes back and he's a

648
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,340
workhorse.

649
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,718
And his body failed him today.

650
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,845
And it's so unfortunate.

651
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,680
>> I'm about to make a break

652
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,807
for the shelter.

653
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,478
(thunder crashing)

654
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,442
>> I'm so sick of the rain.

655
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,945
>> Yeah, me, too.

656
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,450
>> Our leader's not here.

657
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,285
And that's a big hit to take.

658
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,287
(thunder crashing)

659
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,539
It's kind of surreal.

660
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,166
We're kind of just not really

661
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,625
knowing really what to do.

662
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,418
We're used to, we're used to

663
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,295
rallying and saying, "Okay,

664
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:18,795
give us our game plan."

665
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,463
(thunder crashing)

666
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:23,175
Uh, but you can't let these

667
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,634
emotional things distract you

668
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,094
too much out of the game.

669
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,387
You have to keep your focus.

670
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,306
Uh, we still are playing

671
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:29,848
the game.

672
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,099
We're still thinking about the

673
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,017
next person that, that's

674
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,226
going to go.

675
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,103
But I know my heart is really

676
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,229
heavy for Russell.

677
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,316
I just hope that he's okay.

678
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,909
(sighs)

679
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,412
>> All right, we'll try and sit

680
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:52,621
him up.

681
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,247
>> PROBST: Sounds good.

682
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,165
>> All right.

683
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,209
>> I just want you to sit up

684
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,586
from where you are.

685
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,629
Just to there.

686
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,090
Any head spins there?

687
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:03,632
>> A little light-headed.

688
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,467
>> A little light-headed? Okay.

689
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,220
Stay exactly like that.

690
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,304
I'm gonna take your blood

691
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,806
pressure again straight away

692
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,307
and see what change we got.

693
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,808
(device beeping)

694
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,684
Russ, are you okay?

695
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,478
Russ?

696
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,188
Russ? Russ? Just lie down.

697
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,940
Come on, Russ. Russ?

698
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:20,607
Russ? Russ, are you with us?

699
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,068
Lie down. Russ?

700
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,277
>> Russell.

701
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,570
>> Russ, talk to me.

702
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,322
Russ, talk to me.

703
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,199
Russell, Russell,

704
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,367
wake up, mate.

705
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:30,617
Wake up.

706
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,536
You there? Mm-hmm?

707
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,662
Do you remember what

708
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,413
just happened?

709
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:34,788
>> Huh?

710
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,540
>> His heart rate was 97 when we

711
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,499
sat him up, and now it's 68.

712
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,875
Okay?

713
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,168
>> PROBST: And it dropped

714
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:40,627
like that.

715
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,044
>> It dropped really

716
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,796
quickly.

717
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,509
>> PROBST: Just so you're clear

718
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,009
on what's happening is,

719
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,095
is we're going to have to pull

720
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,179
you out of the game.

721
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,639
There's no question to all of

722
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,558
us watching, brother, that, that

723
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:54,975
you are not okay.

724
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,685
>> Come on, come on.

725
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,602
>> PROBST: Russell, we've hung

726
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,937
in there as long as we can.

727
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,147
You are not doing well.

728
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,606
I just watched your, your heart

729
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,400
rate plummet.

730
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,318
>> My family depends on me to

731
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,195
be the strong one.

732
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,822
Is this how you want this

733
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,447
to end?

734
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:09,865
>> PROBST: No, no.

735
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,741
It's frustrating to be pulled

736
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,869
out of a game you wanted to be

737
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,453
a part of for so long.

738
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:15,954
You were in great shape.

739
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,331
You were the leader of a tribe

740
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,040
that was dominating.

741
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,667
You heard no sign that you were

742
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,210
going home any time soon.

743
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,503
You pushed and pushed and

744
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,172
pushed your body until your

745
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,007
body said, "Enough."

746
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,674
There's nothing about that that

747
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,676
is a quitter, nothing.

748
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,595
>> But I'm just dehydrated.

749
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:31,887
I'm not...

750
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,554
>> PROBST: But you're not

751
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,431
recovering fast enough.

752
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,891
You need help, and if you

753
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,517
don't, you're gonna be worse.

754
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,103
Russell, I watched you black

755
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,189
out in front of me two times.

756
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,607
There's no way you could have

757
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,817
stayed in this game.

758
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,319
I'm gonna leave you alone

759
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,154
and stop talking.

760
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,118
(Russell sobbing softly)

761
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,445
>> I feel bittersweet because

762
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,572
we were close to winning, and

763
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,282
then big Russell had his

764
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,284
medical accident.

765
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,161
But when Jeff said that we

766
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,746
still had to go to Tribal

767
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,622
Council, regardless of who won

768
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:45,627
the challenge, it was

769
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,087
surprising, and, you know, a

770
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,046
little upsetting because none

771
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,631
of us want to go back there.

772
00:25:49,714 --> 00:26:03,853
We were just there.

773
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,063
>> I'm packing my bags.

774
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,690
>> I'm for sure packing mine.

775
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,732
>> I have a fair sense of

776
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,650
what's going on.

777
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,818
There's five of us.

778
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,028
We're, again, one big family.

779
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,905
Natalie and I, we both looked

780
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,448
at each other and said it's

781
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,741
gonna be one of us.

782
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,701
And it will be.

783
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,369
I mean, at this point, we need

784
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:19,911
to continue to win, and it

785
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,913
doesn't make sense to vote out

786
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,914
one of the guys.

787
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,541
My gut tells me maybe I'll

788
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,750
stick around because I'm just

789
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,710
competitively stronger, but my

790
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,504
fate and Natalie's fate rest in

791
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:32,882
the three guys in our tribe.

792
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,050
>> Your vote's very simple

793
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,219
tonight.

794
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,137
>> What is it?

795
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,014
>> It's Liz. And then, uh...

796
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,765
>> She and I talked about it.

797
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,226
>> And I'm... I'm trying my

798
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,436
best right now.

799
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,854
Because you know you and Liz

800
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,523
are the two names, of course.

801
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,025
>> For sure. We knew that.

802
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,277
>> So, uh, 'cause I'm putting

803
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,403
Liz, you putting Liz.

804
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,946
I know I can talk Mick into

805
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,697
putting Liz no matter what.

806
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,949
>> I mean, no, she and I

807
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,575
already talked.

808
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,784
We know that it's pretty simple;

809
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,119
I'm voting for her, and she's

810
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,245
voting for me.

811
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,955
>> Yeah.

812
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:14,549
>> How what?

813
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,884
>> I'd like to stay if it's

814
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:32,400
possible.

815
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,486
>> Every time that we come

816
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,488
close to something good, it

817
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,530
kind of gets taken away.

818
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,615
So, winning today would have

819
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,199
been our revenge, you know.

820
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,992
They would have had to watch us

821
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:41,993
eat and, you know, understand

822
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:42,285
how we felt.

823
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,912
And we were winning.

824
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,206
I think what's the most

825
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:46,915
disheartening is not

826
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,166
necessarily the losses, but

827
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,459
just the random things that

828
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,627
keep happening every time you

829
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,711
think you have something good

830
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,713
to go bad.

831
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,423
And, you know, I really hope

832
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:55,924
Russell's okay.

833
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,592
I mean, that, clearly, is the

834
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:57,967
primary concern.

835
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,344
I agree with the decision to

836
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,553
cancel the challenge and all

837
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,096
that stuff.

838
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,806
It just, uh, it just kind of

839
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,015
sucks that when you finally

840
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,475
feel like you're getting in a

841
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,476
groove and going someplace,

842
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,436
it's like, "No, sorry."

843
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,020
>> Do you think we would have

844
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,271
won that?

845
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,564
>> I think we were winning

846
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,357
by a lot.

847
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,817
I'm just wondering, with all

848
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,319
the stars seeming to be aligned

849
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:16,861
against us, how many of us

850
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,406
actually have a shot at getting

851
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,366
real far, you know?

852
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,368
>> Well, I mean, look at...

853
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,994
>> This tribe could be done by

854
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,372
day 21, the rate we're going.

855
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,791
>> I think it could be done.

856
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,834
I think it can be done.

857
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,379
They'll have people flip

858
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,756
over there.

859
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,144
>> I have a feeling that

860
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,395
Shambo's going to be gunning

861
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,063
for me, and so I want to be

862
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:52,856
sure that you have my back.

863
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:53,857
>> Hold on, hold on.

864
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,526
Shh! Shh! Don't talk!

865
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,318
Don't talk!

866
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,446
They were all over, and

867
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,780
they're probably up here,

868
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,030
my crabs.

869
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,408
>> Yeah.

870
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:03,992
>> If we were going to Tribal

871
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,910
Council, right now, Shambo is

872
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,911
going, 100%.

873
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:07,954
>> Here's a medium.

874
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,707
>> From day one, she's never

875
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,332
really jelled with the tribe,

876
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,334
and she's been over to the

877
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,336
other tribe.

878
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,672
None of us have.

879
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,549
And so when we merge, she could

880
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,968
very easily flop sides.

881
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,136
>> So what's, what's the

882
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:23,470
skinny, baby?

883
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,721
We're voting somebody off

884
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,096
tonight.

885
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,681
>> I don't know, honestly, who

886
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:27,974
should go home.

887
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,851
I don't know.

888
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,352
I didn't, like, I honestly

889
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:31,978
didn't think we'd come to like

890
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,688
a second Tribal.

891
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,647
I don't know.

892
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,023
>> Ever?

893
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,441
>> I mean, I thought we would

894
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,567
go to the merge first.

895
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,818
>> See, I'm just asking you guys

896
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,487
to not write my name down today.

897
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,154
>> Mm-hmm.

898
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,697
I mean, I started the fire the

899
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,823
first eight days we were here.

900
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,699
>> Yeah.

901
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:45,867
>> Chief and I collected 100% of

902
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,160
the firewood the first eight

903
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:47,827
days we were here.

904
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,913
I have been a good competitor,

905
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,081
an honest competitor,

906
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:52,832
a fair competitor.

907
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,417
I have not lied to anyone in

908
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,293
this game.

909
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,753
>> That's fine, but despite the

910
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,295
fact, my name got written

911
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,713
down twice.

912
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,381
The only person here who wrote

913
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,634
it down last Tribal was you.

914
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,010
>> So, you're writing my name

915
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:04,719
down tonight?

916
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:05,887
>> I don't know if I'm writing

917
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,804
your name down.

918
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,430
I can't guarantee you anything.

919
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,098
>> Who-who made fire for you the

920
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,475
first eight days you were

921
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:10,850
here, Monica?

922
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,268
Who kept you warm and dry

923
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:12,560
and safe?

924
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,019
>> Who didn't write my

925
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,395
name down?

926
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,021
Everyone else in this tribe

927
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,064
except for you!

928
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,316
The number one reason for

929
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,984
voting off Shambo, for me, is

930
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,319
the fact she wrote my name down

931
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,237
last time.

932
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,905
And you got to take your enemy

933
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,908
out the minute you can, and

934
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,493
right now seems like an

935
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,370
opportune moment.

936
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,916
>> As far as the weak girls go,

937
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,042
who's the weakest girl?

938
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:36,668
>> Monica.

939
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,210
>> Totally!

940
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,002
>> Right?

941
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,170
Bar none.

942
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:39,879
>> Yeah.

943
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,506
>> And I'm sorry, as much as

944
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,090
people like to talk Shambo, we

945
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,551
would not have won the fishing

946
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,176
gear in that first immunity and

947
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,053
started this whole ball rolling

948
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:47,762
without her.

949
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:48,972
And she poses no threat

950
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:49,639
to anybody.

951
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,139
>> Exactly, exactly.

952
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,724
>> No threat.

953
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,351
>> Exactly. None.

954
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,435
>> Post-merge, she does not

955
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,311
have the power, the

956
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,938
manipulative power that a

957
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,565
Laura-Monica tag team or a

958
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,900
Laura or a Monica sole have.

959
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,152
>> Voting Shambo off doesn't do

960
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:03,987
anything beneficial for

961
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,113
any of us.

962
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,198
Monica needs to go for

963
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,283
several reasons:

964
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,036
one, Monica and Laura have this

965
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,871
mother-daughter/sister-sister

966
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,247
relationship.

967
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,123
Post-merge, that's gonna

968
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,125
be dangerous.

969
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,042
One of the two of them needs to

970
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,253
go while we still have a

971
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,255
chance to get 'em.

972
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,423
Laura will be severely weakened

973
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,425
without Monica.

974
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,885
And Monica, I think, is the

975
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,054
clear move because Monica

976
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,347
doesn't help us win challenges

977
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,181
at all.

978
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,725
Is there a better move than

979
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,100
than that?

980
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,227
'Cause I can't think of any.

981
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,895
>> This is not a bad plan.

982
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,816
>> So it's me, you, Brett, Dave

983
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:42,942
makes four.

984
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,027
Either Coach or Shambo come

985
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,987
back, we have numbers;

986
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,279
game over.

987
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,115
No one flips.

988
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,205
>> Who else out here hasn't

989
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,457
lied but me?

990
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,291
No one.

991
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,334
Don't vote me off tonight.

992
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,002
>> Yeah, I know that about you,

993
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,796
Sham, but I know... I know that

994
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,048
your effort speaks for itself.

995
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,466
>> Obviously, it doesn't if

996
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,675
you're not telling me you're

997
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,885
not writing my name down.

998
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,510
>> Just 'cause I'm not telling

999
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,970
you I'm not writing your name

1000
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,096
down doesn't mean I'm not

1001
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,097
writing your name down.

1002
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:13,890
>> Okay.

1003
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,099
>> Shambo is on a very

1004
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,518
need-to-know basis.

1005
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,186
Us four guys-- Dave, Brett, and

1006
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,146
John-- we're pretty good about

1007
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,439
keeping the plan within the

1008
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,441
four of us.

1009
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,817
We're not gonna be telling

1010
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,443
her anything more than what she

1011
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,111
needs to know.

1012
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,988
>> So where you at tonight?

1013
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,824
>> What are your thoughts?

1014
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,367
>> Erik, if you were Shambo,

1015
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,160
who would you vote for tonight?

1016
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:34,994
>> Yeah.

1017
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,204
>> Not me.

1018
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,038
>> Not you.

1019
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,539
>> If I was Shambo, I would

1020
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,333
probably stay consistent.

1021
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,709
>> Who?

1022
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,794
>> Consistent.

1023
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:43,628
I'd stay consistent.

1024
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,921
>> Meaning who you voted for

1025
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,089
last time is probably your

1026
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:46,381
best bet?

1027
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,965
>> You would stay consistent.

1028
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,467
>> If I was Shambo.

1029
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,219
>> What if you were John?

1030
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:56,224
>> Um, I would follow

1031
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,851
the leader; as in Shambo's

1032
00:32:58,935 --> 00:32:59,727
the leader.

1033
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,186
>> Really?

1034
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,105
And if you were Erik, who would

1035
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,022
you vote for?

1036
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:03,523
>> I'd vote for Monica.

1037
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,566
>> Really?

1038
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,651
>> Who are you voting

1039
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,026
for, Shambo?

1040
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,111
Do you get what this is

1041
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:08,736
about yet?

1042
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,112
>> Yeah, I do.

1043
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:09,737
>> Mm-hmm.

1044
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,238
>> Brett's down with it.

1045
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,114
>> He is? Okay, good.

1046
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,156
>> Dave's down with it.

1047
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,866
And that's a wrap.

1048
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,575
>> Okay, cool.

1049
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,202
>> Sham, you got to lock it up.

1050
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,412
>> Lock it up.

1051
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,538
>> No worries.

1052
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,497
If that's what you want from

1053
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,957
me, that's what you've got.

1054
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,874
>> And don't even-- Hounding at

1055
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,001
this is not locking it up.

1056
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,274
>> PROBST: Well, this is a

1057
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,067
first-- 13 people at Tribal

1058
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,569
Council.

1059
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,903
All right, let me give

1060
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,320
everybody an update.

1061
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:55,032
Russell was pulled from the

1062
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,075
game.

1063
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,911
After you guys left, the

1064
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,747
doctors continued to monitor

1065
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,749
his blood pressure, blood

1066
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,166
pressure was steady.

1067
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,169
Two, three minutes in, out of

1068
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,295
nowhere, his heart rate dropped

1069
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,630
like that.

1070
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,758
He blacked out again, went down

1071
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,925
on his back.

1072
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:13,468
At that point, there was no

1073
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,095
question he needed to be pulled

1074
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,180
from the game.

1075
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:21,642
It was the scariest moment I've

1076
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,437
ever had on this show.

1077
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,688
19 seasons, I have never been

1078
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,815
more afraid in my life of how

1079
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,776
bad things were.

1080
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,235
Russell was in terrible shape.

1081
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:35,782
So, the update now is that he

1082
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,324
is in very good hands, being

1083
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,660
monitored, doing fine.

1084
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,078
There was no way he could have

1085
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,121
come back into the game.

1086
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,123
Shambo, what's your reaction to

1087
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,333
hearing that he's no longer in

1088
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,125
the game?

1089
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,628
>> I feel really sad that

1090
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,005
that's how he went out, because

1091
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:52,715
you see this guy with this

1092
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,134
amazing heart and spirit bigger

1093
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,470
than life.

1094
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,763
So, I mean, it's-- it's

1095
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,348
terribly sad.

1096
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,724
>> PROBST: Russell, on one

1097
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,602
hand, it's a break for Foa Foa.

1098
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,269
>> Yeah, he was definitely the

1099
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,814
strongest on their tribe.

1100
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,607
But I just don't like the fact

1101
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,274
that that's how he went out,

1102
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,984
you know?

1103
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,069
I mean, if I was going to beat

1104
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,070
him, I don't want to beat him

1105
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,363
like that.

1106
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,489
>> PROBST: Dave, what does it

1107
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,241
say about this game, when

1108
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,951
you're watching not only

1109
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:20,785
somebody you're on a tribe

1110
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,786
with, and you're also competing

1111
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,829
against, but just another human

1112
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,080
being, going through this

1113
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,748
crisis?

1114
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,916
>> Well, you know, it's

1115
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,668
definitely an eye-opener for me.

1116
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,752
I mean, you get out here and

1117
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,711
it's like a whole different

1118
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,879
level that I did not expect.

1119
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,421
It's been raining for days.

1120
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,132
We haven't been dry for more

1121
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:34,465
than an hour.

1122
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,884
It's pretty intense, easily the

1123
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,553
hardest thing I've ever done,

1124
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,720
and I've done a couple of hard

1125
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,179
things in my life.

1126
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,932
>> PROBST: Erik, this has been

1127
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,517
15 of the toughest days I've

1128
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,144
seen any group go through.

1129
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,397
>> I spent 22 hours in the

1130
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,314
bottom of a tree trunk, and

1131
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,984
with 22 hours, the inability to

1132
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,110
sleep, you prayed about

1133
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:54,735
anything that you could think

1134
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,028
of.

1135
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,071
>> PROBST: Are you literally

1136
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:57,989
praying?

1137
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,198
>> I prayed to God.

1138
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,157
I prayed to Samoa.

1139
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,117
(thunder)

1140
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,243
I prayed to... I don't know.

1141
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,537
I feel like I'm in solitary

1142
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,788
confinement for a crime I

1143
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,414
didn't commit, and that is not

1144
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,292
anything that was advertised.

1145
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,293
>> PROBST: Shambo, what is it

1146
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,461
that keeps you from saying,

1147
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,088
"I'm going to quit?"

1148
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,008
>> I'm the 45-year-old lady

1149
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,511
here that-- that will not quit.

1150
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,305
(thunder)

1151
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,264
And I have been, like Erik,

1152
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,018
shivering and praying-- "Dear,

1153
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:27,560
God, this is Shannon from

1154
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,103
Renton.

1155
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,187
Please, please, please let the

1156
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,522
sun shine."

1157
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,231
>> PROBST: And as we sit here,

1158
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,984
it is starting to pour once

1159
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,277
again.

1160
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,154
>> Yup.

1161
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,280
>> You know, it's not just the

1162
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,781
misery that the rain brings,

1163
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,742
but it's the constant fear, the

1164
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,077
constant torture that it's not

1165
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:45,411
going to stop.

1166
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,288
And every minute, you're

1167
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,624
terrified.

1168
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,708
>> PROBST: Dave, first time

1169
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,168
we've had everybody here

1170
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:52,460
together.

1171
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,295
What's the status of the game

1172
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,922
right now?

1173
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,214
>> Right now, it appears, you

1174
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,507
know, just based on numbers,

1175
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,967
that Galu is ahead.

1176
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,177
And I don't know how their

1177
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,219
spirits are, but they haven't

1178
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,512
had quite the sustenance that

1179
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,597
we have.

1180
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,890
And I know that our spirits, in

1181
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,141
spite of the rain, are pretty

1182
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,268
high.

1183
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,353
>> PROBST: Russell, Dave thinks

1184
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,480
Galu is winning right now.

1185
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,606
Not so good over here at Foa

1186
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,815
Foa?

1187
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,401
>> Attitude at Foa Foa is-- is

1188
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,277
fine.

1189
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:22,490
And I think they're going to be

1190
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,074
shocked in the next couple of

1191
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:23,658
challenges because we can come

1192
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:23,866
back.

1193
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,659
We can even up them numbers,

1194
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,368
and then it will be a different

1195
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,495
story then.

1196
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,580
>> PROBST: Mick, does today's

1197
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,873
challenge, even though we

1198
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,208
didn't finish it, feel like a

1199
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,377
moral victory for Foa Foa?

1200
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,836
>> Yeah, absolutely.

1201
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,588
I mean, we have to take this as

1202
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,714
a win.

1203
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,508
We feel like, at that point, we

1204
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,467
were ahead, and so we'd like to

1205
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,594
think that it would have played

1206
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,388
out and we would have won.

1207
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,139
>> PROBST: Erik, it's got to

1208
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,641
concern you a little bit.

1209
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,351
This group of five believes

1210
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,436
they won today's challenge.

1211
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,813
>> well, they had a big win a

1212
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,064
few challenges ago.

1213
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,232
We came back and we brought it

1214
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,733
again.

1215
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,528
And now today, they got a tie,

1216
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,530
and that's supposed to make us

1217
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,782
nervous about a momentum shift?

1218
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,617
I don't think so.

1219
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,703
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1220
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,496
to the topic of the vote.

1221
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,708
Due to the unprecedented nature

1222
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,876
of today's events, in which,

1223
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,461
for the first time ever, we did

1224
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,422
not complete a challenge, there

1225
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,592
will be no Tribal Council vote

1226
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,011
tonight.

1227
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,513
Nobody going home.

1228
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,140
Galu, you're not voting anybody

1229
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:29,348
out.

1230
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,517
Foa Foa, you will not vote

1231
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,435
anybody out.

1232
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,395
I'm seeing a lot of mixed

1233
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,604
reactions.

1234
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,814
Some happy people.

1235
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,274
And some jaws that are hitting

1236
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,483
the floor.

1237
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,319
Erik, is this good news?

1238
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,696
>> We lost a guy today.

1239
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,905
So, whether we're voting or not

1240
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,949
voting, we're down already.

1241
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,326
So let's stop the bleeding at

1242
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,535
one.

1243
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,661
>> PROBST: Russell, you guys

1244
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,121
would be down to four if you

1245
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:52,663
voted someone out tonight.

1246
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,373
>> Yeah, I think it's the best

1247
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,708
news I heard all day, because

1248
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,500
right now, us five, we're the

1249
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,753
strongest that we've ever been

1250
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,254
this whole game.

1251
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:01,922
So now, if they beat us fair and

1252
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,049
square, then we'll send

1253
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:03,966
somebody home.

1254
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,592
But I really believe that the

1255
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,510
table's about to turn and I'll

1256
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,681
give 110% that it does, so I'm

1257
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,391
going to go all out.

1258
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,894
>> PROBST: Erik, with every

1259
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,854
comment from Foa Foa about

1260
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,147
"bring it," you're getting more

1261
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,440
and more forward.

1262
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,441
>> Let's line it up and let's

1263
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,194
do a challenge right now.

1264
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,195
You know, because that's what

1265
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,071
Russell would do.

1266
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,197
He'd be saying, "Are you

1267
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,114
kidding me?

1268
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,365
There's five of them over there

1269
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:28,949
and there are eight of us over

1270
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,533
here."

1271
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,619
I don't know if there's emotion

1272
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,703
in me that comes up, but every

1273
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,246
bead of sweat that he put into

1274
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,664
everything he ever did, we're

1275
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,750
bringing that to you.

1276
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,585
We will bring that every day,

1277
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,544
every challenge.

1278
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,671
>> We welcome it.

1279
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,717
>> PROBST: Well, it is clear

1280
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,468
that the events of today have

1281
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,805
only intensified the rivalry

1282
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,848
between these two tribes.

1283
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,557
Foa Foa believes they've got a

1284
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,143
moral victory today, and now

1285
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,104
they can turn this game around.

1286
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,855
And Galu believing, "Even

1287
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,190
though we lost Russell, his

1288
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,525
spirit is still with us and we

1289
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,276
will continue to dominate this

1290
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,319
game."

1291
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:05,820
We're in store for a great

1292
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,321
finish.

1293
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:08,239
There is one order of

1294
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,490
business-- Galu, you are now

1295
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,825
without a leader.

1296
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,450
Somebody come grab this.

1297
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,493
When you get back to camp,

1298
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,662
assign a new leader.

1299
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,295
That concludes things for

1300
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:23,504
tonight.

1301
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,506
Foa Foa, grab your torches head

1302
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,633
back to camp.

1303
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,518
Galu, grab your torches.

1304
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,270
Head back to camp.

1305
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,397
Good night.

1306
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,372
>> Being taken out of the game

1307
00:40:58,455 --> 00:40:59,748
for medical reasons is the worst

1308
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,585
thing I've ever felt in my life.

1309
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,712
>> One, two, three, lift.

1310
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,758
>> I played every minute to win

1311
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,093
this game.

1312
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,430
And to have my body fail me is

1313
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:18,100
utterly demoralizing.

1314
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,935
But even though it pains me to

1315
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,814
not be in it, to do it and fail

1316
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,526
is better than to never try.

1317
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,962
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for

1318
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,590
scenes from our next episode.

1319
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,009
>> PROBST: Next time on

1320
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,510
<i>Survivor:</i> At Galu, the guys

1321
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,845
make Shambo one of their own.

1322
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:55,554
>> Only strategic drawback is

1323
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,681
that Shambo is so dim that she

1324
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,476
could screw up our plan.

1325
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,101
>> PROBST: And a Russell seed

1326
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,811
gets planted in the other tribe.

1327
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,355
>> What I have to do now is

1328
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,314
work my Houdini magic.

1329
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,398
>> What are we going to do?

1330
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,858
Go to the final two, the two of

1331
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,567
us?

1332
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,736
>> Final two.

1333
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,241
>> I'm really ashamed that, you

1334
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,493
know, I'm not in the game

1335
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,661
anymore.

1336
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,329
And I'm angry, because I'm a

1337
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:20,579
fighter.

1338
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,789
But at the same time, I have to

1339
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,416
be realistic because I have to

1340
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:24,959
get well, because I have an

1341
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,877
even bigger job to do, one that

1342
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,795
I love, one they cherish every

1343
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,712
day.

1344
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,048
And that's being a husband to

1345
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,132
my wife a father to my child.
