00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,210
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,796
<i>Survivor,</i> at Zhan Hu, James was

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,964
doomed.

4
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:06,464
>> If we lose tomorrow's

5
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,049
immunity, James is going to be

6
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,175
gone.

7
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:09,759
>> PROBST: But at the reward

8
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,760
challenge...

9
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,012
Fei Long wins reward!

10
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,139
...Fei Long kidnapped their old

11
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,724
tribe mate, giving him a chance

12
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,809
to survive.

13
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:21,771
James, this is for you.

14
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,023
At Fei Long, James chose Todd to

15
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:24,607
receive the clue to the hidden

16
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,317
immunity idol.

17
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,736
>> I know what they're talking

18
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:28,153
about.

19
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,071
It's those stupid bats above the

20
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:34,409
freaking thing.

21
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,493
>> PROBST: Todd found the hidden

22
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,244
immunity idol, which was clearly

23
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,080
marked "Congratulations," and

24
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,832
gave it to James as part of his

25
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,250
and Amanda's plan to throw the

26
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,210
immunity challenge and take out

27
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,545
a Zhan Hu member.

28
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,337
>> Throw it.

29
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,172
>> Because that's Jaime's ticket

30
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:47,380
home.

31
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,174
James loses immunity; they vote

32
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,010
for him, but he uses the idol to

33
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,012
get rid of Jaime.

34
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,013
>> PROBST: He then told James

35
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,765
about the second idol hidden at

36
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,641
the Zhan Hu camp.

37
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,225
>> All I have to do is stay

38
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,102
focused, get the other idol.

39
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,438
Now I'll have both of them.

40
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,606
>> PROBST: But at the immunity

41
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,607
challenge...

42
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,316
Go.

43
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,109
>> Ah!

44
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:08,693
>> PROBST: ...Denise couldn't

45
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,528
stomach the chicken fetus...

46
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,905
>> I can't swallow it.

47
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,739
You can do it, James.

48
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,656
Eat it up.

49
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,532
>> PROBST: ...making it

50
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,366
impossible for James to

51
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,159
deliberately lose the challenge,

52
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,661
ruining Todd's plan.

53
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,497
Zhan Hu wins immunity.

54
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,414
With Fei Long facing tribal

55
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,499
council...

56
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,709
>> Genius idea smashed.

57
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,627
>> PROBST: ...Sherea seemed like

58
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,962
a sure bet to go home, but

59
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:28,546
Courtney lobbied to get rid of

60
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,423
Jean-Robert.

61
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,382
>> That's my enemy.

62
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,258
>> I don't trust Sherea.

63
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:32,842
I trust her more than I trust

64
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,511
Jean-Robert.

65
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,970
>> I feel like we should vote

66
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:36,971
out Jean-Robert tonight.

67
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:37,972
>> Todd, I don't know.

68
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,182
My gut feeling is that I don't

69
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:39,516
trust Sherea.

70
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,100
>> And my gut's saying Jean-

71
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,018
Robert.

72
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,729
This sucks.

73
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,355
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

74
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,315
Courtney attacked Jean-Robert's

75
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,775
character.

76
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,692
>> He walks around, he talks a

77
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,902
lot, a lot of judgments of other

78
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,820
people.

79
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,905
He's just a crappy person.

80
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,031
>> PROBST: Despite Courtney's

81
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,950
plea to get rid of Jean-Robert,

82
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,118
the tribe saved him once again.

83
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,495
Sixth person voted out of

84
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:04,749
<i>Survivor: China,</i> Sherea.

85
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,291
Ten are left.

86
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:19,055
Who will be voted out tonight?

87
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:19,722
>> That was a little bit of a

88
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,265
surprise.

89
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:20,849
I didn't even know there was

90
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:29,440
that kind of tension.

91
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,567
>> I promise you, Amanda, if

92
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,526
somebody did that to you, you'd

93
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,652
be a little bit upset about it

94
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,987
too.

95
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,988
>> I personally, Jean-Robert,

96
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,322
feel like my personal feelings

97
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,866
towards you have changed.

98
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,409
I like the guy you kind of

99
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,201
showed me who you can be.

100
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,704
I can't speak for Courtney, and

101
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,246
you can't speak for her.

102
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,456
And you know, I just... I

103
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,667
just... you guys have a tiff.

104
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,626
And if you guys resolve it,

105
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,003
that's what you guys can do.

106
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,713
If not, then not, you know?

107
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,047
>> Jean-Robert, he's horrible to

108
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,799
me.

109
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,342
He's not nice to me.

110
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,177
They suck up to him, even the

111
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,804
two people who want to be, like,

112
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,723
my friends-- like, "friends"--

113
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,390
Todd and Amanda.

114
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,350
I don't feel like I really need

115
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,310
to be anybody's friend in this

116
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,103
game.

117
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,313
I dislike everyone else more

118
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,898
than I dislike Todd and Amanda.

119
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,982
I think they mistake that for

120
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,818
friendship.

>> James, I hope you trust us

126
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,766
now, because we told you we were

127
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,185
going to stick with you.

128
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,357
You know that?

129
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,442
>> Yeah.

130
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,783
>> Yeah, to each other, yeah.

131
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,452
>> Don't let me down, okay?

132
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,038
>> Let you down how?

133
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:49,539
>> Just stick with us.

134
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,165
As long as we all stick

135
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,918
together, you know, if we merge,

136
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,003
we basically sacrificed one of

137
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,379
our old tribe mates for you.

138
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,463
>> We'll see how it goes.

139
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,632
Hopefully...

140
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,883
>> I mean, like, honestly, like,

141
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,968
I like you.

142
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,302
Like, I think, like... I think

143
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:03,845
you've been a huge, like,

144
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,470
competitor in this game, and,

145
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,556
like, I'm one of those people,

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,724
like, I would rather see you go

147
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,766
further just because I really do

148
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,393
think you deserve it.

149
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,978
I really like James personally.

150
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:12,562
I do-- whether he's a really

151
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,648
good con man or he is exactly

152
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,401
how he puts himself out to be.

153
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,610
From what I've seen so far, my

154
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,697
gut instinct is to trust James.

155
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,687
>> I was kidnapped, so, you

156
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,480
know, I got the clue for the

157
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,397
idols.

158
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:56,981
I wasn't going to do like Todd

159
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,775
did and be impatient.

160
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,567
There are so many times when

161
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,153
you're by yourself.

162
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,118
I picked off one.

163
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,036
It was the wrong one.

164
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,664
It was a blank sheet of wood.

165
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,457
So I hurried and picked off the

166
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,584
second one.

167
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,047
I kind of had to hustle off to

168
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,549
my bag and hide it.

169
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,598
Did y'all get anything?

170
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,599
>> We didn't rack up, but we got

171
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,434
a decent amount.

172
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,228
>> So I have it now.

173
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:35,853
I have it in my position, and I

174
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,522
have the two idols.

175
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,190
That's funny.

176
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,650
I'm on<i> Survivor</i> with two idols.

177
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,084
>> Yeah.

178
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,378
>> Yes, it is.

179
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,088
>> This morning, I slept in.

180
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:02,547
I was in a good mood.

181
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,298
And Courtney comes up and sits

182
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,091
down, and she's like

183
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,677
(<i> sighing</i> ).

184
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,011
We all kind of look at her like,

185
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,763
"Uh, are you okay, Courtney?"

186
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,556
>> Jean-Robert could have gone

187
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,765
last night.

188
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,015
>> What?

189
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,016
>> He could have gone last

190
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,309
night.

191
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,310
>> From the way that I'm playing

192
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,728
the game, I need him.

193
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,355
>> Okay.

194
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,064
>> From the way you're playing

195
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,606
the game, you didn't.

196
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,524
>> But, like, when I make a

197
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,568
point to you guys that, like,

198
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,777
this guy does not like me, he's

199
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,820
not nice to me, and I don't feel

200
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,363
like you stick up for me, I feel

201
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,698
like you play, like, "Okay,

202
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,949
well, we need him, so da, da,

203
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,492
da, da," I can't go along with

204
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,743
that.

205
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,828
>> I don't realize that I do

206
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,121
that, Courtney, and I would love

207
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,706
to stand up for you.

208
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,248
>> You don't have to even

209
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,666
stand... just, like, don't

210
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,542
pander to him and say, "You have

211
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,712
a point, Jean-Robert."

212
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,296
>> You have your opinion about

213
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,422
him.

214
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,423
You don't have to like him.

215
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,215
>> But I don't say anything to

216
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:46,924
him.

217
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,633
>> I know you don't.

218
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,759
>> But he walks around falling

219
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,844
around like he's the god

220
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:50,803
everything, and you guys are all

221
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,679
like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

222
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,263
>> We can't have him know that

223
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,764
we don't like him, Courtney.

224
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,183
We can't, or else he will swap

225
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:55,766
on us.

226
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,184
>> He's not here.

227
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:56,726
You can say something to me.

228
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,394
Like, the three of you can...

229
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,395
>> Courtney, you are right.

230
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,146
>> All right.

231
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,147
You know...

232
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,440
>> It does worry me that

233
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,566
Courtney will continue to vote

234
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,401
for Jean-Robert every single

235
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,945
time, because all the other

236
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,322
tribe, if there is a merge,

237
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,698
needs to know that one person is

238
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,657
voting against Jean-Robert, and

239
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,701
they will automatically have

240
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,578
Jaime, Peih-Gee, and Erik with

241
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,871
Courtney voting against Jean-

242
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,456
Robert, and that's a campaign to

243
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,916
get him off, which is losing one

244
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,042
of our numbers.

245
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:21,918
Can we patch things up between

246
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,294
us instead of having hard

247
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,337
feelings like that?

248
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,546
>> What difference does it make?

249
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,423
>> It makes a big difference,

250
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,716
Courtney.

251
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:36,807
>> What does she want?

252
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,433
Like, what does she expect from

253
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:37,683
me?

254
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,353
Right now I need my numbers, and

255
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,354
Jean-Robert is one of my

256
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,231
numbers.

257
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,690
Deal with it, bitch.

258
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,062
>> This used to be hanging on

259
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,730
the archway, and it looks like

260
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,983
someone took it off.

261
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,692
I don't know if it was James,

262
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,735
because James now knows that

263
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,695
there's a hidden immunity idol

264
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,737
as well.

265
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,321
I don't know if he knows where

266
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,116
it is or what it is, but you

267
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,619
know, it looks idol-ish.

268
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,329
Peih-Gee didn't really think

269
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:40,830
much of it.

270
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,330
She doesn't know there's a

271
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,540
hidden idol yet.

272
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,916
So Peih-Gee left.

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,126
I just was like, "Well, I guess

274
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,794
I'll grab it," and put it in my

275
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,131
bag.

276
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,173
>> It could definitely say,

277
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,091
like, "Immunity idol" in

278
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,342
Chinese, and I'd have no idea.

279
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,510
It's a weird symbol, so I don't

280
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:57,138
know what it stands for.

281
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,023
I just want to look in his bag.

282
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,524
Do you think he'll see me if I

283
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,277
pull it out?

284
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,787
I knew it.

285
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,623
He has one in here.

286
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,583
Hey, you watch over there.

287
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,292
Make sure they're not coming

288
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,046
back.

289
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,839
Peih-Gee and James went off to

290
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,842
go frog hunting, so I saw
James'

291
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,052
bag sitting there, and I figured

292
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,261
it might be a good idea to look

293
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,929
through it, because we know

294
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,181
James would have had a good idea

295
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,265
where the hidden immunity idol

296
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,808
was.

297
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,359
I think it's the same thing we

298
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,277
have.

299
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:53,861
Look.

300
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,738
He's got... he's got one in his

301
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,490
pant leg.

302
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,199
>> He's got two?

303
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,033
>> Yeah.

304
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,702
He has two of them.

305
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,387
>> The first board where the

306
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,513
immunity idol could have been

307
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,890
was a blank board.

308
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,017
Apparently it's missing, because

309
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:25,893
I didn't see it.

310
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,061
I know that an animal didn't

311
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:27,978
come up and pick it up and take

312
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,897
it away.

313
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:32,775
The other one's filled.

314
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,112
Does it some more water?

315
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,197
>> I'll bring it over.

316
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,824
Let's see.

317
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,950
>> I figured Jaime would have

318
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,034
been looking for it, but there's

319
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,202
no way this dummy grabbed the

320
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,121
wrong one, because it would have

321
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,163
to say "Immunity" something on

322
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,623
it.

323
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,458
The thought of this woman having

324
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,043
a blank one, I would not be able

325
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,294
to take it.

326
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,588
I would pass out in pure joy.

327
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,632
My head would explode.

328
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,883
I mean, please, let that happen,

329
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,885
please.

330
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,762
That would be the best thing

331
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,472
ever.

332
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,100
That would be the best... that

333
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,269
would be the best one ever, if

334
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,603
she pulled out a blank thing and

335
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,897
was like... "What do you mean?

336
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,649
But it don't have no writing on

337
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,191
there.

338
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:14,775
You at least have to have

339
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,862
some... one of these!"

340
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,033

Guys ready to get to it?

346
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:41,927

Drop your buffs.

360
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,033
>> We have merged.

361
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:04,867
So it's pretty exciting.

362
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,868
I really don't know how to take

363
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,536
it all in right now.

364
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:07,953
It happened so fast.

365
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,996
You know, we just have such a

366
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,040
wide variety of people, so it's

367
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,582
a pretty scary point in the

368
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,250
game.

369
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,502

00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,369
"monsoon"?

570
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,954
>><i> "Dei fung."</i>

571
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,331
<i>"Da fung"</i> is "fighting wind."

572
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,666
It is a unifying factor.

573
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,583
>> We got through the wind.

574
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,251
We got through the rain.

575
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,878
I think it's good.

576
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,963
>> It'll literally be "Fighting

577
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,672
Wind."

578
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,381
>> "Fighting Wind."

579
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,340
>> "Black Fighting Wind."

580
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,675
>> "Black Fighting Wind."

581
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,759
>> Now that we've merged, we are

582
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,301
all playing for individual

583
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,595
immunity.

584
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,472
But there are six original Fei

585
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,224
Long members to four original

586
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,225
Zhan Hu.

587
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,061
The biggest factor is whether I

588
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,688
have James and whether I have

589
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,814
Frosti.

590
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,773
If I can get them both with me

591
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,233
on these first two votes...

592
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,609
these first two votes are

593
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,902
crucial for me to know whether

594
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,070
I'm going to be in a powerful

595
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:15,571
position or a really sucky

596
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,447
position.

597
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,757
>> It is Jeff!

598
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,466
>> Jeff's here.

599
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,759
Guys, guys, you got a visitor.

600
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,719
>> PROBST: No welcome?

601
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,803
>> Jeff's here!

602
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,429
>> Hey, Jeff!

603
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,431
(<i> applause</i> )

604
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,348
>> Hey, guys, guys, Jeff's here!

605
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,893
>> Jeff's at our camp!

606
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,977
>> Is anyone listening?

607
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,769
>> Nobody cares?

608
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,271
>> PROBST: What up?

609
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,607
>> Welcome!

610
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,691
>> Hey, Jeff!

611
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,400
>> Hi!

612
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,234
>> PROBST: Working on the new

613
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:54,443
flag?

614
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,319
>> Yeah.

615
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,279
>> PROBST: Nice.

616
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,488
What's the tribe name?

617
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,615
>> Hei Da Fung.

618
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,824
>> "Black Fighting Wind."

619
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,992
>> PROBST: "Black Fighting

620
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,161
Wind," Hei Da Fung.

621
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,370
>> Hei Da Fung.

622
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,246
>> PROBST: Well, I brought you a

623
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,040
little something.

624
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:08,790
>> We love a little something.

625
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,750
>> We love everything.

626
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,792
>> Is it cookies?

627
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,753
>> PROBST: It's not cookies.

628
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,629
>> Pizza!

629
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,047
>> PROBST: It's not pizza.

630
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,923
It's something much better than

631
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,257
food.

632
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,844
It is a gift for one of you.

633
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,847
It is the individual immunity

634
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,641
necklace.

635
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726
>> Wow!

636
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,356
>> Oh, my God.

637
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:32,940
>> PROBST: And I brought it

638
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,650
because it is time for our first

639
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,818
individual immunity challenge.

640
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,071
>> Oh, my God!

641
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,489
>> PROBST: Follow me.

642
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,826
>> Oh, my God!

643
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,744
>> PROBST: Plop a seat wherever

644
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,455
you like.

645
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,881
So before the merge celebration,

646
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,049
I said, "Let me issue one

647
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,719
reminder: the game never stops."

648
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,804
And I suggested you keep it in

649
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,680
mind as you enjoyed the

650
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,014
festivities.

651
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,516
For today's challenge, you will

652
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,101
be tested on your recollection

653
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:09,685
of events that happened during

654
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,230
the feast and the celebration.

655
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,568
You'll have a tablet.

656
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,903
You'll write your answer down.

657
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,114
If you're wrong, you're out--

658
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,907
single elimination, no second

659
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,702
chances.

660
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,454
>> PROBST: Last person left

661
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,747
standing wins individual

662
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,207
immunity, is safe at the next

663
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,834
tribal council.

664
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:34,626
For the other nine, somebody

665
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,254
will be going home.

666
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,510
>> I'm so screwed.

667
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,052
>> PROBST: You say you're

668
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,886
screwed?

669
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,637
Why, Frosti?

670
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,388
>> I have a horrible memory.

671
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,265
>> PROBST: Going into this

672
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,558
challenge, who is ready for it?

673
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,392
Anybody here pay particular

674
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,269
attention?

675
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,145
>> I paid particular attention

676
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,896
to how much I could eat.

677
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,522
>> PROBST: You guys ready for

678
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,566
the first question?

679
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,527
Here we go, first question: how

680
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,987
many times during the

681
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,197
celebration did firecrackers go

682
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,283
off?

683
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:06,783
Nothing subtle about the

684
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,620
firecrackers when they went off.

685
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,415
Everybody reveal.

686
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,377
Correct answer is three.

687
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,588
There's one at the beginning,

688
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,922
one during, and one at the end

689
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,009
of the feast.

690
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,260
James got it wrong.

691
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:25,719
Amanda got it wrong.

692
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,554
Courtney got it wrong.

693
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,348
And Peih-Gee got it wrong.

694
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,016
You are all out of the

695
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,434
challenge.

696
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,685
Todd got it right.

697
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,020
Frosti, Jaime, Jean-Robert got

698
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:35,604
it right.

699
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,396
And Denise and Erik got it

700
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,815
right.

701
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,484
We are down to six.

702
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,652
What was the centerpiece on the

703
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,697
table?

704
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,074
Describe it.

705
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:51,369
Tell me what it was.

706
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,914
Everybody reveal.

707
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,456
Todd says a dragon.

708
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,750
Frosti, Jaime, Jean-Robert all

709
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,126
say a dragon.

710
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,377
Denise says a dragon.

711
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,837
And Erik says a slender, dark,

712
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,422
glass container...

713
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,548
>> "Slender dark glass

714
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,384
container-- soy sauce?-- and a

715
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,178
stone dragon."

716
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:08,929
>> PROBST: So you covered the

717
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,097
whole table.

718
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,847
It's a good thing you did.

719
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,723
The last thing was right.

720
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,933
Dragon is correct.

721
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,518
Everybody got it right.

722
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,312
Next question: there was a tall

723
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,357
pole with knife blades as ladder

724
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,817
rungs in the middle of the

725
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,902
courtyard.

726
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,322
What color was the pole?

727
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,282
One long, tall pole situated in

728
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,951
the middle of the courtyard--

729
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,621
what color was the pole?

730
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,498
All right, everybody reveal.

731
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,958
Todd originally wrote yellow.

732
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,751
He changed it to red.

733
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,795
Frosti and Jaime say yellow.

734
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,629
Jean-Robert said red.

735
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,673
Denise said red.

736
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,508
Erik said red.

737
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,553
Correct answer was yellow.

738
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,346
>> There we go!

739
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:51,847
>> PROBST: Todd is out.

740
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,765
Jean-Robert is out.

741
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,475
And Denise and Erik are out.

742
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,270
We are down to Frosti and Jaime.

743
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,396
If one of you misses and the

744
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,022
other gets it right, that person

745
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,234
wins individual immunity.

746
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,777
Next question, immunity on the

747
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,655
line: the four cultural dancers

748
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,242
with the long, flowing skirts

749
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,579
wore what on their feet?

750
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:19,166
The four cultural dancers, they

751
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,793
had the long, flowing skirts.

752
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,003
What did they wear on their

753
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:23,545
feet?

754
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,672
>> This is not fair, because I

755
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:29,176
was not looking at their feet.

756
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,344
>> PROBST: All right, reveal.

757
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,889
Jaime says silk stockings.

758
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,057
Frosti says nothing.

759
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,728
The correct answer is...

760
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,190
nothing.

761
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,232
Frosti wins first individual

762
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,775
immunity.

763
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,985
>> Wow, Frosti.

764
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:47,903
(<i> applause</i> )

765
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,904
>> PROBST: Come on over.

766
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,322
Turn around, brother.

767
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,740
Congratulations.

768
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,575
You're safe at the next tribal

769
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,701
council, guaranteed a one in

770
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,496
nine shot at a million bucks.

771
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,080
For the rest of you, somebody

772
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,416
will be going home.

773
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,000
For once, you don't have to go

774
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,627
back to camp.

775
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,794
You're already here.

776
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,086
I'll split.

777
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,754
I'll see you at tribal council.

778
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,007
Congratulations.

779
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,578
>> Damn.

780
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,537
From now on, we got to go to

781
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,497
every tribal.

782
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:40,747
>> Huh?

783
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,540
>> Now we have to go to every

784
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,126
tribal.

785
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,545
The predicament today is that

786
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,672
there's tribal council.

787
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,714
There's a big chance that it's

788
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,634
going to be me, Jaime, or Erik

789
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,177
that's going home, since Frosti

790
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,470
has immunity.

791
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,805
And the big question mark is do

792
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,681
we have James's vote?

793
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,641
And we don't know if James is on

794
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,810
our side.

795
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,522
>> Huh?

796
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,773
Uh-huh.

797
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,984
>> This is a huge vote for us

798
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:09,943
tonight, because we will know

799
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:10,902
where everybody's loyalties

800
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,653
stands.

801
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,279
I mean, it's going to be really

802
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,864
interesting.

803
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,586
>> How great would that be?

804
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,504
You've got them both though?

805
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,463
>> Yeah.

806
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:30,839
>> Five, right?

807
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,049
Me, you, Amanda, Denise,

808
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:33,758
Courtney.

809
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,467
>> Yeah.

810
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,010
>> Beautiful.

811
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:35,635
>> Please hold that together.

812
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,594
>> I promise to.

813
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,013
I'll shake on it.

814
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:38,847
>> I mean, you know I can't talk

815
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,723
to you that much, especially

816
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,974
right now, but I just had to

817
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,059
tell somebody.

818
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,787
>> We just have to keep loyal.

819
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,289
We can't let Jaime and Peih-Gee

820
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:04,831
and Erik break us up.

821
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,499
>> No.

822
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,042
>> I don't think Erik will.

823
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,919
Jaime is a silent leader of the

824
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,589
old Zhan Hu Tribe, definitely.

825
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,214
She's really close with Erik,

826
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,924
and by getting rid of Jaime,

827
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,718
it'll break up that alliance.

828
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,595
And Peih-Gee you can just kind

829
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,137
of see through, you know.

830
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,389
She's a little devious.

831
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,475
But Jaime is so threatening

832
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,851
because people don't see that

833
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,311
right away with Jaime.

834
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,437
Denise is in for sure.

835
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,147
Me, you, like, are locked in.

836
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,066
Todd is locked in now.

837
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,108
But Courtney kind of has a mind

838
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,568
of her own.

839
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,235
Courtney said at tribal council

840
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,945
she doesn't have anyone here she

841
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,322
likes except Sherea.

842
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,406
She was saying stuff like that.

843
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,449
She like, "Well, you guys keep

844
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,367
voting off everyone I like.

845
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,034
You voted off Leslie.

846
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,035
You want to vote out Sherea."

847
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,119
I'm like, "Courtney, this is a

848
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,205
game."

849
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,957
>> Well, the problem is Courtney

850
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:48,750
keeps getting close to people

851
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,043
that we can't have here.

852
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,044
>> I mean, we've done everything

853
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,130
so good.

854
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,223
>> I know, I know.

855
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,224
>> We've got to watch Courtney

856
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,350
because she is a loose cannon.

857
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,768
She does stray off and fall in

858
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,144
love with any swinging Dick or

859
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,604
Harry that floats and smiles at

860
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:09,896
her.

861
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,273
But damn, you don't get friends

862
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,025
on<i> Survivor.</i>

863
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,193
This ain't<i> Love Connection.</i>

864
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,111
Ain't nobody trying to get a

865
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,612
match or a relationship.

866
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,571
You're supposed to make the

867
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,197
strongest team you can and align

868
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,782
with some people you somewhat

869
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,908
can trust to win a million

870
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:26,871
dollars and stop playing around!

871
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,914
>> Thank you.

872
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:28,248
>> It's good.

873
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,666
We have every vote from here on

874
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,291
out.

875
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:30,875
>> I know.

876
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,668
>> Okay?

877
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:31,960
I love it.

878
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:32,877
It will be you, me, and Amanda.

879
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,587
>> It's perfect.

880
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,463
>> 100%.

881
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,339
>> You know right now it has to

882
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,216
go Jaime, Peih-Gee, Erik.

883
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,676
>> I am going to make a

884
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,301
suggestion, and hear me out on

885
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,387
this.

886
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,972
Everybody on our team already

887
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,848
knows Jaime is shady.

888
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,183
We're already suspicious of her,

889
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,227
and nobody's going to trust her.

890
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,645
Peih-Gee we don't know about

891
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:51,771
because she's just starting to

892
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,147
work her magic.

893
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,523
>> Right.

894
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,232
>> Like I said.

895
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:54,899
Today I was, like, surprised.

896
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,483
She just went and plopped her

897
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,067
arm on me.

898
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:56,651
I was like, "You know what?

899
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:57,444
That's kind of cool.

900
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:57,986
That's kind of cool."

901
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,528
I was like, "That's kind of

902
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,154
cool.

903
00:28:59,237 --> 00:28:59,779
This girl's kind of cool.

904
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,613
This girl's all right."

905
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,281
I don't want her to feel all

906
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:01,489
right.

907
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,699
>> And she's working her way

908
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,283
with Courtney.

909
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:03,950
>> I don't want to feel all

910
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,452
right with her in a few days.

911
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,202
>> Right.

912
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:06,786
>> You know?

913
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,248
>> So...

914
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:10,957
>> Oh, one thing also.

915
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,043
If somehow you do end up

916
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,670
screwing me over, you know, the

917
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,589
game or whatever-- and I don't

918
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,214
believe that's going to happen,

919
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,717
but if I get screwed, I'm going

920
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,301
to hold you responsible, not

921
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,469
Amanda.

922
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,303
>> Okay.

923
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,304
>> Just so you know.

924
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,222
And you will never, ever see a

925
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,474
juror lobby so hard against

926
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,308
somebody.

927
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,184
You will not win.

928
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,435
>> Okay, okay.

929
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,187
>> If I get screwed, it's going

930
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,188
to be on you, because I know you

931
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,397
have more power than her.

932
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:34,981
>> Okay.

933
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,483
>> Yeah.

934
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,026
It's the three of us.

935
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,152
We're going.

936
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,905
>> Good.

937
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,864
>> If I didn't agree to all of

938
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,949
his terms, right away the trust

939
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:45,825
with me and him, he wouldn't

940
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,826
trust me anymore, so he would

941
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,703
have moved along and found

942
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:49,579
another alliance and done who

943
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:49,954
knows what.

944
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,624
So of course I agreed to it all

945
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,249
and was like "Yeah, we're going

946
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,834
to the top three, man.

947
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,335
We're going all the way.

948
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:55,919
I'm watching your back."

949
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,213
Little does Jean-Robert know...

950
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,506
like, little clue, no, he has no

951
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,632
idea that I'm ready to... when I

952
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,842
need to.

953
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,807
>> I have no idea.

954
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,517
Some days I do.

955
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,101
Some days I don't.

956
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,775
>> Uh-huh, I'm sure they will.

957
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:29,244
>> Did she?

958
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,871
>> Yeah.

959
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,053
>> Well, hello.

960
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,277
>> Me and Erik found it, and he

961
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,070
has it in his pack.

962
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,280
>> Wait.

963
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,489
>> Okay, this... I'll...

964
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,323
>> How do you know it's the

965
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,491
immunity idol?

966
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,326
>> Because there's two sides to

967
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,828
the sign, right?

968
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,829
We were lying there.

969
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,871
One day I was on the bed, and it

970
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,248
was just lying on the floor.

971
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,417
So I picked it up, and I was

972
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,585
like, "Erik, what is it?"

973
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,794
We're like, "I don't know."

974
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:21,087
So he put it in his bag.

975
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,505
Well, then the next day, we

976
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,089
found two of them in James's

977
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,383
bag.

978
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,552
So we're like, "He must have got

979
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,930
spooked by us and dropped it."

980
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,765
And we picked it up and put it

981
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,267
in our possession.

982
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,184
We're thinking we'll play it

983
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,686
tonight anyway, no matter what.

984
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,645
>> Uh-huh.

985
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,230
>> If they're all voting for me,

986
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,607
and I have the idol, then the

987
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,983
only votes that count are ours,

988
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,651
so Jean-Robert will be voted out

989
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,361
instead.

990
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,571
So we might as well try and use

991
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,780
it tonight.

992
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,407
>> Jaime came up to me with Erik

993
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,575
and said that she had found

994
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,659
something that she thought was

995
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,118
an idol.

996
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,871
Now, I've seen the actual idol

997
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,748
from the Fei Long camp.

998
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,083
And what she's describing is

999
00:31:59,167 --> 00:31:59,959
similar, so there is a

1000
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,045
possibility that she has one.

1001
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,087
The worst that would happen

1002
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,131
would be that Jean-Robert would

1003
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,215
end up going home if she knew to

1004
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,008
play it.

1005
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,843
And now that I've won the

1006
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,303
immunity idol, I'm in a safe

1007
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,013
place, and both tribes think

1008
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,348
that I'm with them.

1009
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,807
So I could easily be considered

1010
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,017
a swing vote, and I could go

1011
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,813
either way.

1012
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,523
>> What are you thinking?

1013
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,441
>> Do you know anything about

1014
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,025
the immunity idol over here?

1015
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,527
>> Well, I know a little, but

1016
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,487
not much.

1017
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,113
>> Okay.

1018
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,948
If you can somehow just keep me

1019
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,867
here tonight, I think I know who

1020
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,202
has your immunity idol, and I

1021
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,621
know who has mine.

1022
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,789
>> Do you know who has them

1023
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,539
both?

1024
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,165
>> I do.

1025
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:39,999
>> Okay.

1026
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,876
>> And I'll tell you tomorrow if

1027
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,377
you can keep me around.

1028
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,961
>> And you know, I acted all

1029
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,004
interested when Jaime told me

1030
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,631
that she knew who had the hidden

1031
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,674
immunity idols and that she was

1032
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,758
going to tell me, but she made

1033
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,384
it sound like someone from their

1034
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,302
tribe has one and someone from

1035
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,178
our tribe has one.

1036
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,014
Wow, does she have to catch up.

1037
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,101
So... she's... she's on the

1038
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,102
small bike in the back, you

1039
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,813
know, just pedaling as fast as

1040
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,814
she can.

1041
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,481
How did you find out who got

1042
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,025
ours?

1043
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,236
>> Um, long story.

1044
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,195
I'll explain it, everything,

1045
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,071
but...

1046
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:10,905
>> Okay, okay.

1047
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:11,781
>> I've come to realize that I'm

1048
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,407
very good at playing stupid, and

1049
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,283
it works to my advantage, so I

1050
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,159
think I'm just going to stick on

1051
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,536
with it.

1052
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,412
As far as the other tribe's

1053
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,454
concerned, I think they kind of

1054
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,580
think I'm little Jessica Simpson

1055
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,373
out here running around in the

1056
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,042
jungle.

1057
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,378
If Todd sees me play the hidden

1058
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,629
immunity idol tonight, he's

1059
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,964
definitely going to be floored

1060
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:28,923
when he sees it come out.

1061
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,007
I think it's probably going to

1062
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,009
shock everyone, including Jeff.

1063
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:32,969
I'm not as dumb as I look, and

1064
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:37,849
maybe they're figuring it out.

1065
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,016
>> Dude, I'm telling you, it has

1066
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,227
to go Peih-Gee and then Jaime.

1067
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,270
>> I don't want any dissension

1068
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,980
amongst us until we get to the

1069
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,606
final six, until all of them are

1070
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,107
gone.

1071
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,942
Then we can act as much as a

1072
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,444
fool as we want.

1073
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,194
>> It's Peih-Gee.

1074
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:50,737
>> We can't screw this up.

1075
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,238
>> I'm telling you it's done.

1076
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,239
>> There should be no mistaking.

1077
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,490
>> I'm just telling you 100%,

1078
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,199
that's where I'm going.

1079
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,452
>> No, don't say that.

1080
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,703
We're going to pick who it is,

1081
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,829
and we're sticking together.

1082
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:00,747
>> It's Peih-Gee.

1083
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,205
Okay, yes, we are.

1084
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,290
>> Jean-Robert probably would go

1085
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,458
home tonight, because Jean-

1086
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,877
Robert is stupid.

1087
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,295
>> This girl is the enemy.

1088
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,379
This girl is the devil!

1089
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,297
This girl is the devil!

1090
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,632
>> The best scenario is for the

1091
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,258
Fei Long Tribe to stick together

1092
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,553
and vote off the Zhan Hu Tribe,

1093
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,889
but Jean-Robert's dumb ass is

1094
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,140
going to vote for Peih-Gee, even

1095
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,726
though we all said Jaime.

1096
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,895
It's been Jaime for a month now.

1097
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,855
The Zhan Hu people naturally are

1098
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,856
going to vote for Jean-Robert.

1099
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,065
They know he's the easy win.

1100
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,691
And lord help him if Courtney's

1101
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,777
dumb ass decides to vote for

1102
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,945
Jean-Robert out of pure spite

1103
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,905
because she just wants to be

1104
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,281
hateful.

1105
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,891
>> PROBST: Full house.

1106
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:02,475
Amanda, from a game point of

1107
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,811
view, how did the merge change

1108
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,479
the game?

1109
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,647
>> Well, Jeff, it's kind of

1110
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,649
nice, actually, because we spent

1111
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,191
a lot of time as, like, Fei

1112
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,359
Long, wondering what the other

1113
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,152
tribe was doing.

1114
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,320
So it's kind of nice to have

1115
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,239
some new people around, and we

1116
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,490
all get along really well.

1117
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,366
We're having a lot of fun.

1118
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,159
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee, when you

1119
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,202
hear Amanda say it's fun, does

1120
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,120
that make you think she has no

1121
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,372
clue what this game is about or

1122
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,331
that she's extremely confident

1123
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,708
that she's not going anywhere?

1124
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,334
>> Well, of course, I mean, they

1125
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,962
have higher numbers.

1126
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:31,587
So I'm sure it's easier for them

1127
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,214
to have fun.

1128
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,216
>> PROBST: Jean-Robert, you're a

1129
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,801
student of people.

1130
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,219
Have you noticed a shift in how

1131
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,387
people are operating?

1132
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,639
>> It's so interesting how the

1133
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,349
dynamic changed from the team

1134
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,225
now to the individual.

1135
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,226
Now that we're in the individual

1136
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,187
situation, I very much see

1137
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,981
Courtney making it down to the

1138
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:50,523
bottom two, bottom three,

1139
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,275
because she's not going to be

1140
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,068
perceived as the type of threat

1141
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,778
that James or myself might be.

1142
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,363
So now she's somebody that

1143
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,990
nobody's going to be gunning for

1144
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,407
for a while.

1145
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,242
I don't see her name showing up

1146
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,910
on a ballot for a long time.

1147
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,744
>> PROBST: Courtney, you're

1148
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,495
rolling your eyes.

1149
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,371
Why?

1150
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,206
>> Because this is now Jean-

1151
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,875
Robert trying to be like, "The

1152
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,001
biggest threat in the room is

1153
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,002
the little blonde!

1154
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,295
Come on, everyone!"

1155
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,005
It's a person who I don't get

1156
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,214
along with pointing out that all

1157
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,257
of a sudden I'm going to be the

1158
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,134
biggest threat there is.

1159
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:18,634
It's just... it's funny.

1160
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,136
>> I didn't say she's going to

1161
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:20,636
be the biggest threat.

1162
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,470
I said that it's likely she's

1163
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,305
going to get the furthest.

1164
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:22,930
>> Which translates to "You're a

1165
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,682
big threat."

1166
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,516
>> I don't think it does.

1167
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,309
It means that you're not a

1168
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,144
threat.

1169
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,061
And the same is true for several

1170
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,730
people in this group.

1171
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,439
>> PROBST: James, why does that

1172
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,899
bother you?

1173
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:33,983
>> Jean-Robert, he just don't be

1174
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,026
quiet.

1175
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,651
I don't know.

1176
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,819
He just don't stop.

1177
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,737
>> PROBST: And you think that

1178
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,322
that might become a liability?

1179
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,698
>> Yeah, he puts his name on the

1180
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,657
chopping block because he's

1181
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,408
always saying, "Oh, well, I'm

1182
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:42,950
going on the chopping block

1183
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,118
today."

1184
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:44,660
He'll mention it every day.

1185
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,495
When he's tired, he'll announce

1186
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,580
that he's tired.

1187
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,414
He doesn't have to do that.

1188
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,040
See, when you're tired, just go

1189
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,041
lay down.

1190
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:50,625
We understand.

1191
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,417
You're a card player.

1192
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,543
You haven't been in the sun.

1193
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,461
You're used to people bringing

1194
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,629
the food up to you, probably

1195
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,713
putting it in your mouth and

1196
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,881
helping you chew.

1197
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,965
You know, we don't expect that

1198
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:58,758
much from you.

1199
00:36:58,841 --> 00:36:59,800
So you don't have to go on and

1200
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,384
on about it, which I guess is

1201
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,385
part of his tactic.

1202
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,386
But I'm like, "Dude, you don't

1203
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,097
have to talk that much."

1204
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,057
>> PROBST: Peih-Gee, when you

1205
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,641
guys all merged together, did

1206
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,018
you try to find cracks in the

1207
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,853
Fei Long group?

1208
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,063
>> You kind of know about some

1209
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:12,521
of the cracks already.

1210
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,524
We've had spies back and forth.

1211
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,151
I know Jean-Robert's name has

1212
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,070
come up quite a bit.

1213
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,113
He's politicking his ass off.

1214
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,573
He's doing everything he can to

1215
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,449
ensure that he's got as many

1216
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,786
votes on the jury as possible.

1217
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,787
>> PROBST: Jaime, what do you

1218
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,871
think the key is to getting the

1219
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,331
attention off you?

1220
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,582
If you hear that your name is on

1221
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,168
the block, what should you do?

1222
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,044
>> You know, I just kind of

1223
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:35,670
wanted to come in here and talk

1224
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,421
to the Fei Long members, just in

1225
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,506
case there was a crack, just in

1226
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,465
case there was someone on that

1227
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,716
team that they just can't stand

1228
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,842
enough that they would be happy

1229
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,969
to get rid of.

1230
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,136
You know, it just would take one

1231
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,096
other person to be like, "I

1232
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,013
really can't stand this person

1233
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,223
anymore; I want them to go home,

1234
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,391
and Jaime is more pleasant to be

1235
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,767
around, so..."

1236
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,102
>> PROBST: All right, Frosti has

1237
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,353
the immunity necklace.

1238
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,396
I know you're not giving it up.

1239
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,481
You cannot vote for Frosti.

1240
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,900
Everybody else is fair game.

1241
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:58,943
It's time to vote.

1242
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,153
Erik, you're up.

1243
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,637
>> Trying to keep it Zhan Hu.

1244
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,000
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1245
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,253
votes.

1246
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:12,933
Once the votes are read, the

1247
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,809
decision is final.

1248
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,560
The person voted out will be

1249
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,436
asked to leave the tribal

1250
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,729
council area immediately.

1251
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,396
I'll read the votes.

1252
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,190
>> Jeff, I have a question for

1253
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,108
you.

1254
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,152
>> PROBST: Yes.

1255
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,403
>> I found this at camp lying on

1256
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,532
the floor, so I thought it might

1257
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:33,454
be immunity.

1258
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,540
>> PROBST: Thanks.

1259
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,630
The rules of<i> Survivor</i> state that

1260
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,091
if the hidden immunity idol is

1261
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,301
played, any votes cast against

1262
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:49,178
that person will not count, and

1263
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,387
the person with the next highest

1264
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,806
number of votes be will be sent

1265
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,807
home.

1266
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,058
That's in the case of a hidden

1267
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,935
immunity idol being played.

1268
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,812
This, however, is not a hidden

1269
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,815
immunity idol.

1270
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,486
>> Oh, my gosh!

1271
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,612
(<i> laughter</i> )

1272
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:10,116
Oh, oh!

1273
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,075
>> PROBST: Any votes cast

1274
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:11,617
against Jaime will count.

1275
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,038
I'll now read the votes.

1276
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:21,710
First vote, Jean-Robert.

1277
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,548
Jaime.

1278
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,966
Jaime.

1279
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,217
Two votes Jaime, one vote Jean-

1280
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,720
Robert.

1281
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,013
Jean-Robert.

1282
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,140
We're tied, two votes Jaime, two

1283
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,685
votes Jean-Robert.

1284
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,103
Jean-Robert.

1285
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,354
That's three votes Jean-Robert,

1286
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:44,859
two votes Jaime.

1287
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,402
Jaime.

1288
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,027
Tied again, three votes Jaime,

1289
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:52,908
three votes Jean-Robert.

1290
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,076
Jaime.

1291
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,910
Four votes Jaime, three votes

1292
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:59,957
Jean-Robert.

1293
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,041
Jaime.

1294
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,042
That's five votes Jaime, three

1295
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,921
votes Jean-Robert.

1296
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:06,964
Seventh person voted out of

1297
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,174
<i>Survivor: China</i> and the first

1298
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,550
member of our jury, Jaime.

1299
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,218
That's six.

1300
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:11,760
That's enough.

1301
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,180
You need to bring me your torch.

1302
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:26,150
Jaime, the tribe has spoken.

1303
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,651
Time for you to go.

1304
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,578
Well, the game has just shifted

1305
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,913
again.

1306
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,955
With Jaime becoming the first

1307
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,332
member of the jury, you are now

1308
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,875
voting people out of the game

1309
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,668
who will ultimately decide who

1310
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,628
they feel is most deserving of

1311
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,963
the title of sole survivor and

1312
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,131
the million dollars that goes

1313
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,549
with it.

1314
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:50,925
Grab your torches.

1315
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,343

>> I would love to see some

1328
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:17,701
craziness.

1329
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,619
>> PROBST: ...Todd wants to

1330
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,621
blindside James.

1331
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,039
>> If we blindside him, both

1332
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:22,665
immunities would be out of play.

1333
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,333
>> PROBST: ...causing his

1334
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,209
alliance to question his

1335
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,126
leadership.

1336
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,044
>> Todd is all over the place

1337
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:27,878
right now.

1338
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,712
>> He won't listen to anyone.

1339
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,338
>> PROBST: And Peih-Gee makes a

1340
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,589
power play.

1341
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,757
>> There's five of us here.

1342
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,926
I'll try anything at this point.

1343
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,225
>> I learned that I'm probably

1344
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,184
too nice for the game of

1345
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,185
<i>Survivor.</i>

1346
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:43,769
I wish Erik and Peih-Gee the

1347
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,646
best of luck.

1348
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,772
I made a bad decision with

1349
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,648
James.

1350
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,692
He's obviously not very

1351
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,193
trustworthy, and I hate that I

1352
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,361
trusted him.

1353
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,070
I'm kicking myself in the butt

1354
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:53,904
right now.

1355
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,780
I tried to plain the hidden

1356
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:55,823
immunity idol.

1357
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,824
It wasn't it, but it was worth a

1358
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,909
shot, so I'm glad I tried it.
