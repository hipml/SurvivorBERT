I STOLE EVERYTHING FROM THEM.

189
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,067

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,286
REDEMPTION ISLAND IS NOT.

198

WOMEN YOU'RE HEADING OUT THIS

210
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,179

211
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,598
WE'RE NOT LISTENING THOSE

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,648

TOGETHER AND TAKE THE BOYS DOWN,

218
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,196
THEN WE'LL BE ONE HUGE BALL OF

219
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,323
BAD-ASSNESS.

220
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,881
AS WE WALKED THROUGH THE

221
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,507
JUNGLE, WE BEGAN TO REALIZE, OH,

222
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,551
MY GOD.

223
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,927
THIS ENCAMPMENT IS HUNDREDS OF

224
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,720
MILES AWAY, AND WE HAD TONS OF

225
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,638
STUFF TO CARRY.

226
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,391
IT WAS A HUGE BURDEN.

227
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,560
WE EACH LOST 10 POUNDS OF WATER

228
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:21,065
WEIGHT.

229
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,485
I'M TRYING TO ACT ALL TOUGH

230
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,862
BUT INSIDE I'M JUST HURTING,

231
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,654
JUST SUCKING WIND.

232
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,823
BUT THE GUY THAT IMPRESSED ME

233
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,534
THE MOST ON THAT TREK WAS LEIF.

234
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,660
HE WAS CARRYING THE HEAVIEST

235
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,995
THING OUT OF ANYBODY.

236
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,831
YOU KNOW, HE'S A BUFF LITTLE

237
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,123
DUDE.

00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,207

239
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,835
YEAH.

240
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,836
BACK THERE.

241
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,421
WATCH OUT.

242
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:50,803
WE'RE STUCK ON SOMETHING.

243
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:57,101
THIS IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

244
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:05,109
OH, MY GOD!

245
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,737
PUT THE COCONUT INTO THE

246
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,029
BASKET.

247
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,572
COME ON.

248
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,239
WE CAN DO IT.

249
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,115
ALL RIGHT.

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,241
ARE YOU SURE?

251
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,244
WELL, THEN PUT THE POT.

252
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,704
GIVE HER THE POT.

253
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,497
YEAH, I WASN'T TOO THRILLED

254
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,082
ABOUT THE MEN VERSUS WOMEN

255
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:20,458
THING.

256
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,542
I'M A GIRL.

257
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,460
I KNOW, I'M CRAZY.

258
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,169
WE'RE ALL CRAZY.

259
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,921
I MEAN, WOMEN-- AND THAT'S THE

260
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,257
THING TOO, BUT NOE OFFENSE, BUT

261
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,759
WOMEN CAN BE SEE WARM AND THEY

262
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,802
SEEM SO UNDERSTANDING AND

263
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,929
COMPASSIONATE AND ACCEPTING, AND

264
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,264
THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, JUST

265
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,766
LIKE-- YOU KNOW.

266
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,143
YOU BETTER PUT THAT ON YOUR

267
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:39,852
SHOULDER.

268
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,520
THE HIKE INTO CAMP DEFINITELY

269
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,647
SHOWED WHO ARE THE STRONGER

270
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,151
GIRLS, AND IT'S KIM, MYSELF, AND

271
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:47,735
CHELSEA.

00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,694
AND I WOULD SAY SABRINA.

273
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,614
I LOVE KITTY KAT.

274
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,741
SHE WAS A LITTLE WEAK AND SHE

275
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,535
WAS IRRITATING ME, BUT SHE KNEW

276
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,622
THAT.

277
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,208
RIGHT AWAY I ALREADY KNEW WHO

278
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:02,917
OUR FIVE WAS GOING TO BE AND IT

279
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,877
WAS DONE IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.

280
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,923
IT'S ME YOU, KAT.

00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:09,423

283
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,303
I THINK THAT CORE CAN WIN

284
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:14,762
CHALLENGES, ACTUALLY.

285
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,179

00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,195
TIME WILL TELL.

IN, RIGHT?

295
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,323
I DIDN'T PLAN TO FORM AN

296
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,616
ALLIANCE RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

297
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,867
I WAS JUST GOING TO LAY LOW BUT

298
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,078
I THINK WHEN THE GUYS STARTED

299
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,413
STEALING OFF THE TRUCK, THAT WAS

300
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,872
A HUGE RIVALRY RIGHT OFF THE

301
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,623
BAT.

302
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,626
AND WHEN THE GUYS DID THAT, THE

303
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,836
GIRLS UPON LIKE, WOMEN POWER!

304
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,797

305
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:58,973
GOING WITH IT.

00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,851
LADIES, WE ARE SO CLOSE.

00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,810
LOOK AT THE MOUNTAINS AND THE

308
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,102
CLOUD.

00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,732
CRAZY!

310
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,861

SO WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

315
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,874
SHUT UP!

316
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,878

WHATEVER.

319
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,716
WHEN WE WALKED ON TO THE

320
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,051
BEACH, WE LOOKED UP AND SAW OUR

321
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,385
FLAG AND WE WERE SO HAPPY TO GET

322
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,596

WHAT IS GOING ON?

326
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,226

PARTY!

330
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,736
WE WERE KIND OF PISSED.

331
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,737
NICE TO SEE YOU, LADIES.

332
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,448
SO WE ACTUALLY DO GET TO SEE

333
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,074
THEM AT LEAST.

334
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,909
WHEN WE SAW OUR FLAG I WAS

335
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,576
EXCITED.

336
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,869
BUT WHEN I SAW THER FLAG NEXT TO

337
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,704
OUR FLAG I WAS JUST CONFUSED.

338
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,748
I WAS LIKE, WAIT.

339
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,457
WHAT?

340
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,917
SO I'M GOING TO HOLD ON TO THIS

341
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,378
JUST IN CASE THE LADIES GET ANY

342
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:10,920
IDEAS.

00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,712
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE

ONE WORLD TO ME, BRO.

348
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,804
IT LOOKS LIKE THEIR WORLD AND

349
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:26,060
OUR WORLD.

350
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,937
DO YOU SEE IT?

351
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,021

00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,620
SOME THINGS THEY STOLE FROM US.

387
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,747
THEY PLAYED DIRTO THAT TRUCK.

389
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,625

390
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,334
GAME, AND GAME ON.

391
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,211
WE WILL GIVE THEM THE CHICKEN

392
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,045
BUT WE NEED THEM TO HELP US WITH

393
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:16,587
OUR SHELTER.

394
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,506
LET'S GO OVER HERE.

395
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,924
I'M NOT A LADIES' MAN.

396
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,800
I'M NOT A GUY THAT'S GOING TO GO

397
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,927
AROUND AND KEEP THE GIRLS HAPPY.

398
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,887
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THOSE GIRLS.

399
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,514
GIVE US THAT CHICKEN AS AN

400
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,848
APOLOGY, AND THEN WE'LL THINK

401
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,891
ABOUT TALKING.

402
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,768
SCREW THE CHICKENS FOR NOW.

403
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,852
WE NEED TO BUILD A SHELTER.

404
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,103
THEY NEED US MORE THAN WE

405
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:33,771
NEED THEM.

406
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,480

MINUTE THAT I'M WITH THE GUYS,

00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:36,899

00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,903

00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,149
LUMBERJACKS COMING THROUGH.

418
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,944
THERE'S A CLEAR DIVIDE

419
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,112
WITHIN, LIKE, THIS "ONE WORLD."

420
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,114
THERE'S THE GUYS OVER HERE AND

421
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,407

00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,219
I MEAN, THE MINUTE I SAW

433
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,138
COLTON I KNEW COLTON WAS GAY.

434
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,015
HE'S VERY COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

435
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:51,599
GOOD FOR HIM.

436
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,142

I LOVE YOU ALREADY.

442
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,440
I ALSO KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING

443
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,649
TO HAVE PROBLEMS IDENTIFYING

444
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,483
WITH THE GUYS AROUND CAMP.

445
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,152
THERE'S A LOT OF MANLY MEN

446
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,653
AROUND HERE.

447
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,155
NOBODY HAS AN ISSUE WITH HIM

448
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,197
BEING GAY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

449
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,284
IT'S JUST HE DOESN'T TRY TO FIT

450
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:10,951
IN AT ALL.

451
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,495
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST CHANCE I

452
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,204

453
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,456
I'M GOING TO BE OVER HERE.

454
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,166
IF COLTON DOESN'T FIX, THAT

455
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,709
HE'S GOING TO BE GOING HOME

456
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,251
QUICK.

457
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,210
I MEAN, I JUST KNOW,

458
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,004
IMMEDIATELY, I'M-- WE'RE LIVING

459
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:22,755
WITH THE GIRLS.

460
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,298
THE GIRLS ARE GOING TO LIKE ME.

461
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,176
IF YOU GET-- IF YOU'RE MORE

462
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,469
ONE OF THE GIRLS THAN ONE OF THE

463
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,219
GUYS THEY'RE ALL GOING TO WANT

464
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,639
TO GET RID OF YOU.

465
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,640
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE GUYS AND

466
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,016
WANT TO BE A RUNNER AND USE THAT

467
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,768
TO OUR ADVANTAGE, THE ACCESS,

468
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,477
YOU'RE SAFE.

469
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,811
SO DO THAT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

470
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,729
ALL RIGHT?

471
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,649
MATT IS-- HE'S VERY ARROGANT,

472
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,483
FIRST OFF.

473
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,859
HE'S VERY CONDESCENDING AND HE

474
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,152
THINKS HE'S RUNNING THIS SHOW.

475
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:49,490
BUT IF I GET WHAT I WANT, HIS

476
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,866
TORCH IS GOING OUT.

477
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,243
SO IS THIS THE FRATTED BOY

478
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:53,911
ALLIANCE OVER HERE?

479
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,536
YEAH.

480
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,206
YOU GUYS ARE WORKING HARD.

481
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,500
FRAT BOYS?

482
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,751
I WAS BLINDED BY THE HOTNESS,

483
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,878
ALL RIGHT.

484
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,129
WE'RE PUTTING A HUGE TARGET

485
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:04,546
ON OUR BACK.

486
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,173
NO, WE'RE NOT.

487
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,050
WHAT IS ANYBODY GOING TO DO

488
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:08,634
ABOUT THAT?

489
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,177
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

490
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,886
YOU GET FOUR STRONG.

491
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,972
THE WAY "SURVIVOR" WORKS IS THE

492
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,598
STRONG SAY BECAUSE THEY BENEFIT

493
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,266
THE TRIBE AND THE WEAK GO.

494
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,267
I'M ALIGNED WITH BIG MIKE,

495
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,894
J-BIRD AND BILL.

496
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,104
IT'S AN EASY ALLIANCE.

497
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,814
WE'RE THE YOUNG, FIT GUYS.

498
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,732
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET

499
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,526
ANY "SURVIVOR" POINT FOR THAT

500
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,110
ONE.

501
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:26,902
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE WE

502
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:27,945
NEED TO TALK ABOUT.

503
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,363
EVERYBODY ELSE IS SCREWED.

504
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,197
( LAUGHS )

505
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,782
I'M IN THE GROUP AND I'M

506
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,076
HAPPY AND IT'S THE DOMINANT

507
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,078
ALLIANCE, CLEARLY, SO I'M SIT,

508
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,996
PRETTY, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

509
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:47,548
WHERE ARE MY MATCHES?

510
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,799
CAN I-- HOLD ON.

511
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,717
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

512
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,384
YEAH.

513
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,720
CAN I TALK TO YOU THREE JUST

514
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,011
FAIR SECOND?

515
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,679
SURE.

516
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,140
I AM NOT, LIKE, TRYING TO BE

517
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,935
"THAT PERSON" BUT IF ANY OF YOU

518
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,270
FIND, LIKE A CLUE TO AN IDOL OR

519
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,439
ANYTHING, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHO

520
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:08,110
NEEDS IT THE MOST.

521
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:08,777
'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY TWO THINGS

522
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,280
THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP ME THIS

523
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,281
GAME AND IT'S THE IDOL AND JESUS

524
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,951
AND HE AIN'T SHOWING UP.

525
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,953
COLTON IS A WILD CARD.

526
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,663
I-- MY GUT ITS TELLING ME TO

527
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,749
BELIEVE IN HIM, BUT WHO KNOWS?

528
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,333
ANYTHING CAN GO DOWN IN

529
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,460
"SURVIVOR" BUT HE HAS ME

530
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,919
CRACKING UP IN STITCHES.

531
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,881
AND IF HUMOR IS HIS ARMOR, THEN

532
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,133
HE HAS ALL OF US SOLD LIKE

533
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:41,143
SUCKERS, SO I LIKE HIM.

534
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,312
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ONE

535
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,314
WORLD, TWO ME IT'S TWO
HEMISPHERES

536
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,356
THEIR TRIBE VERSUS OUR

537
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,819
TRIBE.

538
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,155
I DON'T REALLY THINK THE WOMEN'S

00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,992

540
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,701

THEIR SIDE SO I DON'T WANT TO

542
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,537
HELP THEM IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.

543
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,288
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THEY

544
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,623
NEED TO STAY ON THEIR SIDE.

545
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,624
I'LL STAY ON MINE.

546
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,292

547
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,835
NEED THEM, THEN WE'RE IN CHARGE

548
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,503

00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,209
SWAPPED-- IF SOMEONE CAME OVER

568
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,544
AND STARTED A FIRE, AND WE GAVE

569
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,507
YOU A CHICKEN?

570
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,258
WE SAID WE'D WORK TOGETHER

571
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,386
AND SPLIT THE CHICKEN, NO MATTER

572
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,178
WHO CAUGHT THEM.

573
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:58,554
OKAY, WE'LL SEE.

574
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,221
ALL RIGHT.

575
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,181
THE WOMEN DEFINITELY NOTICED

576
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,183
THE FIRE, AND AS SOON AS THEY

577
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,229
SAW THAT SMOKE, THEY CAME

578
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:07,813
A-RUNNIN''.

579
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,397
I'M JUST CHECKING IT OUT.

580
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,398
I'M JUST CHICKING IT OUT.

581
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,733
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

582
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,402
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

583
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,695
WHERE IS THAT CHICKEN?

584
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,238
I AM THE MASTER OF THE

585
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:16,905
CHICKEN.

586
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,740
THE CHICKEN THING SET THINGS

587
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,242
OFF ON THE WRONG NOTE.

588
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,619
THEY WANT US TO GIVE THEM FIRE

589
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,871
AND THAT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

590
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,414
SINCE YOU GUYS STOLE OUR AXE,

591
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,415
MAYBE WE COULD TRADE THAT AWX

592
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,082
STOLE.

593
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,417
LISTEN, YOU HAVE NINE GUYS

594
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,586
HERE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A

595
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,129
CHICKEN AND THEY'RE NEGOTIATING.

596
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,714
YOU GIRLS ALWAYS COME BARE

597
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,006
HANDED.

598
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:34,590
YEAH.

599
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,049
LISTEN, WE'RE BEYOND THE

600
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:36,592
CHARM.

601
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,260
YOU'RE BEYOND THE CHARM?

602
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,429
LISTEN, I'M A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR

603
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:40,971
CHARM.

604
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,764
WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME!

605
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,224
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK!

606
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,434
IT WAS WORTH A TRY.

607
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,603
IT WAS WORTH A TRY.

608
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,439
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU,

609
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,443
THESE CHICKS OVER THERE, THEY'RE

610
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,613
IN KOOKUE-LAND.

611
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,573
THEY WANT TO TRADE FIRE FAIR

612
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,282
CHICKEN.

613
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:00,657
IT'S THE FIRST DAYS, IT'S THE

614
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,283
FIRST HOURS.

615
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,244
WE DON'T NEED A CHICKEN.

616
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:08,790
IF MONICA TAKES HER PANTS OFF

617
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,625
WILL YOU GET US ONE.

618
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,752
MONICA, WE'RE GOING TO SET UP

619
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,963
A POLE AND YOU GIRLS USE THE

620
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,465
GIRL AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

621
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,634
I DON'T KNOW NAKED.

622
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,469
IF WE GET NAKED, WE GET WHAT?

623
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,262
I HAVE NO IDEA.

624
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,472
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THAT.

625
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,474
SEE, THEY'RE NOT AGREEING TO

626
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,058
ANYTHING.

627
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,142
THE GIRLS ARE SO TYPICAL.

628
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,311
I'VE BEEN AROUND 50 YEARS, LADY.

629
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,646
YOU DIDN'T JUST COME OVER HERE

630
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,607
WITH A SET OF TATTERS ON YOU AND

631
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,692
WALKING AROUND IN YOUR BIKINI.

632
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,777
YOU'RE NOT GETTING FIRE FROM ME

633
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,819
IN THE FIRST DAY.

634
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,196
YOU HAVE TO SUFFER TWO OR THREE

635
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,614
DAYS AND MAYBE ONE BY ONE

636
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,490
THEY'LL QUIT-- "WE'RE DONE!

637
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,494
THIS IS NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP

638
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,036
FOR."

639
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,663
LET'S GO RINSE OFF.

640
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,830
AND THINK ABOUT THE FIRE WE

641
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,498
DON'T HAVE.

642
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,666
I JUST WISH WE HAD A LITTLE

643
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,375
BIT OF FIRE SO WE COULD HANG OUT

644
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,084
AND TALK.

645
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,294
WAIT, MAYBE WE SHOULD GO OVER

646
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,338
TO THE GUYS' CAMP AND JUST ASK

647
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,839
IF THEY MIGHT WANT TO GIVE US

648
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,507
FIRE.

649
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,508
IT'S NOT JUST THEY WANT FIRE.

650
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,550
I WANT TO SEE YOU GUYS.

651
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,385
I WANT TO TALK MORE.

652
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,512
I WANT A CAMPFIRE SETTING.

653
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,806
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE AMBIANCE.

654
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,558
ME, TOO, ME, TOO-- WHAT DOES

655
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,519
THAT MEAN, AMBIANCE?

656
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,395
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.

657
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,522
WE WERE JUST GOING IT COME

658
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,190
AND SEE IF YOU WANTED TO GIVE US

659
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:15,857
FIRE NOW.

660
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,359
DO YOU WANT TO SHARE AT ALL.

661
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,652
WE JUST WANT TO SEE EACH

662
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,987
OTHER SO WE CAN TALK.

663
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,570
REALLY.

664
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,531
WE WANT CAMPFIRE SETTING.

665
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,533
I DON'T KNOW IF FIRE IS GOING

666
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,200
TO HAPPEN.

667
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:26,326
WHO DO WE HAVE TO CONVINCE?

668
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,536
WHO DO YOU THINK IS RUNG THE

669
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:27,869
SHOW OVER HERE?

670
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,246
TARZAN?

671
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:33,041
YOU THINK TARZAN IS RUNNING

672
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,335
THE SHOW THE OVER HERE.

673
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:46,221
AOOOHHHH!

674
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,597
YOU SEE TARZAN AND THINK HE

675
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,933
MUST BE CALLING THE SHOTS.

676
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,727
I'M JUST ASKING.

677
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,021
MATT, AND BILL AND YOU.

678
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:58,066
THEY'RE DEHYDRATED.

679
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,402
THERE'S NO WATER.

680
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,112
THEY CAN'T BOIL THE FIRE SO US

681
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,406
HAVING FIRE IS A BIG ADVANTAGE.

682
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,074
IS THAT A NO, JAY?

683
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:06,742
IS THAT A NO?

684
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,952
YOU'RE AT WAR HERE, PERIOD.

685
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:09,619
SOMEBODY HAS TO BEAT SOMEBODY,

686
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,537
SO I THINK ANY DEAL WITH THE

687
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,623
GIRLS AT THIS POINT IS

688
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,082
LUDICROUS.

689
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:14,541
THEY'RE DOWN.

690
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,250
KEEP THEM DOWN.

691
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,835
IF THEY GET FIRE ON THEIR OWN,

692
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,419
GOOD FOR THEM.

693
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,422
IF THEY DON'T, LET THEM

694
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,132
STRUGGLE.

695
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:31,433
( SNORING )

696
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,977
TONIGHT, CHRISTINA AND I

697
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:34,686
THOUGHT THE BOYS STOLE THE AXE

698
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,939
FROM US, SO LET'S GO OVER AND

699
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:45,655
STEAL AN EMBER FROM THEM.

700
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,617
SHOOT.

701
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,952
I MEAN, WE'RE HERE.

702
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,790
MIGHT AS WELL JUST DO IT.

703
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,918
OKAY, LET'S GIVE IT A WHIRL.

704
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:23,652
DO YOU GUYS WANT PINEAPPLE

705
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,486
FOR BREAKFAST BECAUSE THAT'S ALL

706
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:24,903
WE'VE GOT?

707
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,155
YEAH, MAYBE.

708
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,991
I CAN'T BELIEVE Y'ALL STOLE A

709
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:30,951
FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

710
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:31,618
YEAH.

711
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,829
LAST NIGHT WE WENT OVER AND

712
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,831
TRIED TO STEAL AN EMBER.

713
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,540
DID WE START A FIRE?

714
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:36,957
YEAH.

715
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,667
DID IT LAST?

716
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:38,959
NO, IT DIED.

717
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,338
COME ON.

718
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,798
I SMELL IT.

719
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,508
DO YOU SMELL IT?

720
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,384
YOU CAN'T SMELL THAT?

721
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,677
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!

722
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,261
I SMELL WOOD BURNING.

723
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,846
FIRE IS SO IMPORTANT.

724
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,682
WE NEED TO GET THAT FIRE TO-DAY.

725
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,766
OH, GOD.

726
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,186
I CAN'T DO THAT FAST BY MYSELF.

727
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,854
I THINK SOME OF THESE GIRLS

728
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,688
WHO HAVE THIS CHIP ON THEIR

729
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,648
SHOULDER THINKING WE DON'T NEED

730
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,315
THE GUYS.

731
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,650
LOOK, IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT

732
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,235
PRIDE IT'S ABOUT, YES, WE HAVE A

733
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,945
GAME TO PLAY, BUT WE ALSO NEED

734
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,572
TO SURVIVE AS WELL.

735
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,159
LOOK, GUYS, WE REALLY NEED

736
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:12,868
FIRE.

737
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,869
WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE THAT WE

738
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,996
CAN WORK TOGETHER, LIKE, FOR

739
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,749
FIRE, FOR INSTANCE?

740
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,878
IF YOU GUYS ARE WILLING TO

741
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,879
LEAVE US 40 OF THOSE--

742
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,338
YEAH, WE WILL--

743
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,340
WE WOULD GIVE YOU FIRE, AND

744
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,342
WE WOULD EVEN MAKE IT FOR YOU.

745
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,051
40?

746
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,635
IT'S JUST-- THAT'S SO MUCH.

747
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,929
THAT'S A LOT OF WORK.

748
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:37,517
20, EACH PERSON DO TWO?

749
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,019
20 FRONDS AND YOU'VE GOT A

750
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:39,311
DEAL.

751
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:39,853
OKAY.

752
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,063
SHE IS A NEGOTIATOR.

753
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:42,731
I'VE LEARNED A LOT.

754
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,900
CHRISTINA KEEPS GOING TO THE

755
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,068
BOYS' CAMP, MAKING DEALS.

756
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:47,736
EVERY TIME PEOPLE FIND HER SHE'S

757
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,238
DOING, LIKE, HANDSHAKES AND

758
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,364
THINGS LIEB THAT.

759
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,073
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE LITTLE

760
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,743
PEACE TREATIES WITH THE GUYS.

761
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,745
I'M NOT STUPID POOP WE CAN DO 20

762
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,579
AND THEY'LL DO FIRE.

763
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,956
BUT WE NEED THEIR FRONDS.

764
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,374
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

765
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,042
DONE.

766
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,251
ARE YOU BRINGING IT TO US OR

767
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,252
DO WE HAVE TO CARRY IT?

768
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,962
WE'LL COME OVER HERE, WE'LL

769
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:06,755
DO IT--

770
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,548
NO, SHE WANTS THEM BROUGHT TO

771
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,216
HER.

772
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:09,883
WE WILL WEAVE FOR THEM, BUT

773
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,219
WE ARE GOING TO WEAVE AT OUR

774
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,929
CAMP AND THEY'RE GOING TO BRING

775
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:14,721
US OUR FIRE.

776
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,722
LET ME TELL THEM.

777
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,015
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO DO

778
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,682
THEM OVER HERE.

779
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,601
I'M ABOUT TO PUNCH CHRISTINA

780
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,102
THERE HER FACE.

781
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,063
I SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING.

782
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,397
SHE'S TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY WITH

783
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,482
THE GUYS AND SHE'S GOING TO BE

784
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,775
THE FIRST ONE TO GO, FIRST ONE

785
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:36,451
TO GO.

786
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,786
I JUST WENT TO GO KIND OF,

787
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,789
YOU KNOW, TAKE A BATH, AND ON MY

788
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,665
WAY BACK I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT?

789
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,961
LET ME LOOK FOR THE IDOL WHERE

790
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:54,469
ARE YOU?

791
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:54,761
OH, MY GOD.

792
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,428
OKAY.

793
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,306
I AM HAVING AN AMAZING DAY.

794
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,432
LITERALLY, THE SECOND PLACE I

795
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,684
LOOKED, I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD!

796
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,311
THERE'S A PACKAGE."

797
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,312
I FOUND THE IDOL!

798
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,313
OH, MY GOD.

799
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:05,981
ANOTHER ALL RIGHT.

800
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,650
THIS IS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

801
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,486
FOR THE MANONO TRIBE.

802
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,862
IF YOU'RE NOT A MANONO TRIBE

803
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,490
MEMBER YOU MUST GIVE THIS TO

804
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,199
SOMEONE.

805
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,534
I FOUND AN IDOL BUT IT'S NOT FOR

806
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,159
ME.

807
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,536
THE RULE SAYS IT'S FOR THE

808
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,287
MANONO TRIBE.

809
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,496
I HAVE TO GIVE IT UP BEFORE THE

810
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,247
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND I'M

811
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,957
JUST TRYING TO THINK, LIKE, WHO

812
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,793
SHOULD I GIVE IT TO?

813
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,130
THANK YOU, GUYS.

814
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,341
OUR MAIN THING SGIRLS, I

815
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,012
DON'T WANT TO CAUSE SOMETHING IN

816
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,805
YOUR ALL CAMP, BUT I NEED A

817
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,848
PARTNER TO HELP ME FIND AN IDOL.

818
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,058
I HAVE TO SAVE SOMEONE FROM

819
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,643
THE GUYS' TEAM.

820
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,061
THAT COULD HURT OR HELP ME.

821
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,690
COLTON IS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE.

822
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,569
I FOUND AN IDOL BUT IT'S NOT

823
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,320
FOR ME.

824
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,030
I CAN'T USE IT FOR ANYONE ON MY

825
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:55,780
TEAM.

826
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,824
I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO ONE OF YOU

827
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,366
GUYS.

828
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:58,867
I HAVE TO SAVE YOU.

829
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,827
OBVIOUSLY, I'M HER

830
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,078
FIRST-CHOICE CANDIDATE TO GIVE

831
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,582
THE IDOL TO.

832
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,708
IT'S TAKE, EVERYTHING NOT TO

833
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,959
JUMP UP AND DOWN RIGHT NOW.

834
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:19,429
THIS IS, LIKE, MY SAVING GRACE.

835
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:29,564
COME ON IN, GUYS!

836
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,857
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET

837
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,193
TO YOUR FIRST IMMUNITY

838
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:33,443
CHALLENGE?

839
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,194
YES.

840
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,363
WHOOO!

841
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,072
Jeff: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

842
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,741
ON MY GO, ONE AT A TIME YOU WILL

843
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,118
JUMP FROM A 25-FOOT TOWER INTO A

844
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,119
NET BELOW.

845
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,538
YOU'LL THEN RACE ACROSS A GIANT

846
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,415
BALANCE BEAM AND MAKE YOUR WAY

847
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,292
OVER A LONG ROPE BRIDGE.

848
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,919
ONCE ALL YOUR TRIBE MEMBERS ARE

849
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,088
AT THE MAT, RAISE YOUR TRIBE

850
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:53,755
FLAG.

851
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,881
FIRST TRIBE TO RELEASE THEIR

852
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,967
FLAG WINS IMMUNITY AND IS SAFE

853
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,219
FROM THE VOTE.

854
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,261
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

855
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,097
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST

856
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,265
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:

857
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,393
ONE WORLD" AND SENT HOME.

858
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,937
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR

859
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,606
FIRE IN THE FORM OF FLINT.

860
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,273
BIG STAKES.

861
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:12,899
WORTH PLAYING FOR.

862
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,274
YES.

863
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:13,775

864
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,442
OH, YEAH!

MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

867
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:23,618
WE'LL GET STARTED.

868
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,538
THIS IS A VERY HIGH FALL.

869
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,039
MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR ARMS TO

00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,291

00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,059
THE WOMEN ARE BEHIND, NEED TO

I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.

941
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,807
Jeff: EVERYBODY HOLD UP!

942
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,100
STOP WHERE YOU'RE AT!

943
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,102
STOP!

944
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:54,686
MEDICAL.

945
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,895
WE NEED MEDICAL IN TO SEE

946
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:02,277
KOURTNEY.

947
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,944
LET ME SUPPORT IT.

948
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,113
DON'T LET ME MOVE IT.

949
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,447
ANY PAIN HERE?

950
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,115
YES, YES.

951
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,157
CAN YOU MOVE THAT THUMB?

952
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:08,825
NO.

953
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,411
CAN YOU WIGGLE YOUR FINGERS

954
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,245
AT ALL?

955
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,455
CAN YOU MAKE A FIST?

956
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:19,586
CAN YOU BEND IT BACK AT ALL?

957
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,003
THAT HURTS.

958
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:25,425
ALL RIGHT.

959
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,844
Jeff: RAMONA GIVE US AN

960
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:28,469
UPDATE.

961
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,596
WHEN KOURTNEY CAME OFF THE

962
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,305
NET HE LANDED WITH HER ARM DOWN

963
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,975
LIKE THAT ON THE SO SHE BENT IT

964
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,143
BACK AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE BONE

965
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,436
MIGHT BE BROKEN HERE.

966
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,146
YOU CAN SEE A BIG BEND THERE.

967
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,647
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU JUST SPRAIN

968
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,816
SOMETHING IT CAN BRUISE AND IT

969
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:44,110
CAN SWELL UP, SO I WANT TO MAKE

970
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,945
SURE IT IS NOT JUST A BAD SPRAIN

971
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:46,613
THAT IT ISN'T BROKEN.

972
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,615
WE'D LIKE TO GET AN X-RAY TO

973
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,282

00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,491
Jeff: SO IT'S UNCLEAR RIGHT

00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,534
NOW WHAT IT IS FOR SURE.

976
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,201
UH-HUH.

977
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,620
Jeff: NULL X-RAY, YOU WON'T

978
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:53,870
KNOW.

979
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,537
YUP.

980
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,455
Jeff: WHICH MEANS WE'RE NOT

981
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,664
SURE OF HER STATUS IN THE GAME

982
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,165
AT THIS POINT.

983
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:57,582
ABSOLUTELY.

984
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,291
Jeff: OKAY.

00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,042

989
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,132
STATUS OF THAT.

990
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,175
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

991
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:07,634
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

RIGHT NOW, IT'S UNCLEAR.

999
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,192
TECHNICALLY, THIS CHALLENGE

1000
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,153
REQUIRES NINE PEOPLE START, NINE

1001
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:27,862

WHAT'S THE DECISION?

1027
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,743
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IMMUNITY.

1028
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,494

GOING TO GO THE OPPOSITE WAY.

1033
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,875

RIGHT WAY?

1039
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,214
I UNDERSTAND.

1040
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,924
IF IT WAS REVERSED AND ONE OF US

1041
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:30,466
GOT HURT, I JUST DON'T THINK IT

1042
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,218
WOULD BE THE SAME THING.

1043
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,219
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

1044
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,096
LET ME JUST FINISH, LET ME

1046
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,099
THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO

1047
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:38,641
WIN.

1048
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,308
OKAY?

1049
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,518
THERE'S PLENTY OF CHALLENGES

1050
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,437
LEFT IF YOU GUYS WANT TO PROVE

1051
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,438
YOURSELF THAT YOU CAN DO IT, BUT

1052
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,440
THERE'S NO WAY YOU GUYS WOULD

1053
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,774
SAY, "LET'S PLAY OVMENT.

1054
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,275
YOU JUST WOULDN'T DO IT.

1055
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,277
I JUST DON'T BUY IT.

1062
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:55,950

UPDATE ON KOURTNEY.

1070
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,293
IN OUR MINDS, WE KNEW THAT

1071
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,003
THERE WAS NO CHANCE THEY WOULD

1072
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,671
JUST TAKE THE IMMUNITY, AND WHEN

1073
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,965
THEY DID, IT WAS, LIKE,

1074
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:11,632
HEARTBREAK.

1075
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,801
THOSE GUYS DON'T GIVE A CRAP

1076
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,678
ABOUT ANY OF US GIRLS AND THEY

1077
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,679
SHOWED IT TODAY.

1078
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,305
THEY DON'T CARE.

1079
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,390
THIS IS A NO-MERCY GAME.

1080
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,158
YEAH, THE CHALLENGE.

1081
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:37,742
WOW.

1082
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,328
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

1083
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,830
I FEEL SO BAD FOR KOURTNEY, AND

1084
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,290
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY, BUT IT'S

1085
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,709
DISAPPOINTING NOT TO BE ABLE TO

1086
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,336
FINISH IT AND ONLY GOT THROUGH

1087
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,171
THE FIRST PART OF IT, AND THIS

1088
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,506
IS WHAT HAPPENED.

1089
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,340
( LAUGHS )

1090
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,634
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED!

1091
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,302
YEAH, IT SUCKED THAT WE

1092
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:56,969
COULDN'T, YOU KNOW--

1093
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,473
I KNOW, I WANTED TO AT LEAST

1094
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,140
TRY IT.

1095
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,892
IT'S KIND OF, LIKE, WHAT HAD

1096
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,643
TO BE DONE.

1097
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,894
MY ONLY THING IS I FELT LIKE WE

1098
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,229
WERE GOING TO BEAT YOU GUYS

1099
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:06,854
ANYWAY.

1100
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,855
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

1101
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,356
NEVER KNOW NOW.

1102
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,525
IT'S A GAME, RIGHT?

1103
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,234
THAT'S RIGHT.

1104
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,195
THE GUYS WITH THE NOT WANTING

1105
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,404
TO FINISH THE CHALLENGE, YOU

1106
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,948
KNOW, I GET IT.

1107
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,200
IN HINDSIGHT I CAN LOOK BACK AND

1108
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,576
SEE MAYBE WHAT THEY WERE

1109
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,244
THINKING.

1110
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,412
BUT I'M FROM TEXAS, MEN ARE

1111
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,373
CHIVALROUS, GREW UP WATCHING

1112

WESTERNS.

1113
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,875
IT'S JUST, LIKE, NO GUY I KNOW

1114
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,543
WOULD HAVE MADE THAT CHOICE.

1115
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,087
RIGHT NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE WHO

1116
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,463
HAS MAJORITY OF THE NUMBERS?

1117
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,548
HOW IS IT SPLIT UP?

1118
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,258
4-4 WITH ME IN THE MIDDLE.

1119
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,218
IF YOU SAY IT'S 4-4, YOU'RE

1120
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,388
THE SWING VOTE, RIGHT?

1121
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,722
THAT'S YOUR BIG MOMENT IN THIS

1122
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,391
GAME TO KNOCK OUT ONE OF THE BIG

1123
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,058

1124
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,601
BECAUSE THE THING STHAT THE

1125
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,395
STRONG GUYS ARE ONLY KEEPING YOU

1126
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,354
ON BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU'RE

1127
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:48,896
DISPOSABLE.

1128
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,565
NO, THEY'RE KEEPING ME

1129
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,400
BECAUSE THEY WANT ME TO BE ABLE

1130
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:52,984
TO WORK Y'ALL.

1131
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,361
RIGHT, YOU'RE DISPOSABLE

1132
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,404
THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY YOU.

1133
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,781
BUT WHEN I GET WITH YOU ALL--

1134
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,907
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

1135
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:09,876
SO I'M GIVING YOU THIS IDOL.

1136
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,877
I LOVE YOU.

1137
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,587
LISTEN, LISTEN VERY

1138
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,337
CAREFULLY.

1139
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,297
I MEAN RIGHT NOW IT'S UP TO YOU

1140
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,214
HOW YOU PLAY IT.

1141
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,257
THIS IS THE BIG MOVE THAT

1142
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,924
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR.

1143
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,093
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE RISK.

1144
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:19,468
FORGET WHO'S GOING TO BE PISSED

1145
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,095
OFF AT YOU.

1146
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,639
SWING OVER AND THINK ABOUT THE

1147
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,683
GAY GUY THAT COME INSIDE WHO

1148
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,976
EVERYBODY THINKS IS GOING TO GET

1149
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,102
OUT IN THE FIRST ROUND, YOU COME

1150
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,437
OVER AND YOU KNOCK OFF ONE OF

1151
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,481
THE BIGGEST PEOPLE THERE.

1152
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,900
HE HEADS INTO THE MERGE AND

1153
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,484
THEN WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS

1154
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,152
AROUND.

1155
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,904
DON'T LET HIM PUNK YOUR ASS,

1156
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,613
ALL RIGHT?

1157
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,616
I WANT YOU TO STAY AROUND, OKAY.

1158
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,742
THIS ISLAND WOULD NOT BE FUN

1159
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,117
WITHOUT YOU.

1160
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:43,910
I LOVE YOU.

1161
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,455
LOVE YOU MORE.

1162
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,289
MATT THINKS I'M A PUPPET AND

1163
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,833
HE'S IN FOR A HUGE SURPRISE IF

1164
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,459
EVERYTHING GOES LIKE I WANT IT

1165
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,168
TO.

1166
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,046
WE'RE GOING TO CUT HIS THROAT

1167
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,756
FASTER THAN TAYLOR SWIFT WILL

1168
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,467
WRITE A SONG ABOUT HER NEXT

1169
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,051
BOYFRIEND.

1170
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,802
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE BIG

1171
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,803
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM?

1172
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,513
WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE

1173
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,140
LAST MINUTE BECAUSE WE ARE GOING

1174
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:06,933
TO TRIBAL TONIGHT, TRIBAL

1175
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:07,600
COUNCIL.

1176
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,017
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S OKAY.

1177
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,644
I DON'T KNOW.

1178
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,939
EVEN IF SHE'S BACK IN THE GAME,

1179
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,316
HOW CAN SHE REALLY PARTICIPATE?

1180
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:15,608
REALLY?

1181
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,609
I MEAN--

1182
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,152
SHE BROKE HER WRIST.

1183
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:19,654
SHE SAID SHE HEARD IT CRACK.

1184
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,197
I GUESS WE JUST WAIT AND SEE.

1185
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,530
HARD TO DECIDE WITHOUT

1186
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,156
HEARING.

1187
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,659
I HOPE-- THIS IS GOING TO

1188
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,410
SOUND MEAN-- BUT HOPEFULLY SHE'S

1189
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,662
GETTING X-RAYED AND JUST REALLY

1190
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,829
GETTING USED TO THE AIR

1191
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,498
CONDITIONING THERE, AND GETTING

1192
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,832
A FRESH DRINK OF WATER AND

1193
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,501
SAYING, "I LIKE THIS," AND DON'T

1194
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:41,217
COME BACK.

1195
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,679
KOURTNEY, POOR KOURTNEY.

1196
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,389
SO UNCOORDINATED.

1197
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,598
OBVIOUSLY, SHE BROKE HER WRIST.

1198
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,517
BUT I'M GOING TO DEFINITELY TURN

1199
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,977
THE TABLES AROUND AND LET THEM

1200
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,562
KNOW THAT CHRISTINA NEEDS TO GO.

1201
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,189
IT'S GUYS VERSUS GIRLS, AND

1202
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,524
SHE'S PLAYING THAT SIDE AND

1203
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,525
PLAYING US AT THE SAME TIME.

1204
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,234
SHE'S POISON.

1205
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,819
SO I'M GOING TO CALL HER OUT.

1206
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,529
I ALREADY KNOW IT.

1207
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,531
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO SEE

1208
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,157
WHEN WE GET THERE WHO IS GOING

1209
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:15,209
TO BE KICKED OUT.

1210
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:24,635
TO BE KICKED OUT.

1211
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,762
Jeff: BEHIND IECH OF YOU IS

1212
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,722
A TORCH.

1213
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,182
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.

1214
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,559
APPROACH A FLAME, DIP IT IN, AND

1215
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,893
GET FIRE.

1216
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,729
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1217
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,604
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

1218
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,567
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1219
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,235
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE

1220
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,904
YOU.

1221
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,114
WELL, WELCOME TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1222
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,366
I'LL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON

1223
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,911
KOURTNEY'S CONDITION IN A FEW

1224
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,579
MINUTES.

1225
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,246
FIRST I WANT TO GET A LAY OF THE

1226
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,749
LAND OF THE FIRST TWO DAYS.

1227
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,499
ALICIA ATELL ME ABOUT THE FIRST

1228
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,418
MOMENT WHEN YOU WALK ON TO YOUR

1229
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,753
CAMP AND YOU REALIZE, WE'RE

1230
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,046
GOING TO BE LIVING WITH THE MEN?

1231
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,964
I ACTUALLY LIKE TO BOND WITH

1232
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:02,757
GIRLS BETTER.

1233
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,259
MY WEAKNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

1234
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:07,428
GUYS BEING, LIKE, WITH US SO I'M

1235
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,180
GLAD THAT THEY MOVED OUT.

1236
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:09,597
Jeff: KAT, WHO IS LEADING

1237
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,264
THIS TRIBE?

1238
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,974
EVERYBODY ON THIS TRIBE HAS A

1239
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:12,975
ROLE THAT THEY'RE PLAYING.

1240
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:13,642
LIKE, I CONTROL THE FIRE.

1241
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,478
BUT EVERYONE DOES THEIR

1242
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,730
INDIVIDUAL ROLES.

1243
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,482
Jeff: SO YOU HANDLE FIRE.

1244
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,901
AND, KRISTINA, HOW DID YOU GUYS

1245
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:22,485
GET FIRE?

1246
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,194
WELL, WE WENT OVER TO THE

1247
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,487
GUYS AND I SAID, "LOOK, IS THERE

1248
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,739
ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO THAT WE

1249
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,615
CAN WORK WITH WHERE YOU CAN HELP

1250
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,159
US WITH THE FIRE BECAUSE WE NEED

1251
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:30,659
IT TODAY."

1252
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,745
I CAN INTERRUPT?

1253
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,788
WHAT HAPPENED WAS A SHADY DEAL

1254
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,455
WENT DOWN.

1255
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,165
SHE TOLD THE GUYS SHE WOULD HAVE

1256
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,083
TWO GIRLS WEAVE FOR THEM.

1257
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:37,792
I DIDN'T TELL THEM I WOULD

1258
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,086
HAVE TWO GIRLS WEAVE FOR THEM.

1259
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,253
HOLD IT, I'M TALKING.

1260
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:41,962
COME ON!

1261
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,090
YOU DID.

1262
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,174
WE COULD HAVE KOURTNEY--

1263
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:45,883
YES, YOU DID.

1264
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,968
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION.

1265
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,303
NOW WE CAN MOVE ON.

1266
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:54,642
HOWEVER, IT DID BENEFIT US.

1267
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,977
IT DID BENEFIT US, YES.

1268
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,813
WE DID GET FIRE THIS WHOLE TIME.

1269
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,148
Jeff: I'M STILL NOT 100%

1270
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,149
SURE WHAT HAPPENED.

1271
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,652
ALICIA, THE DEAL WAS EXACTLY

1272
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,319
WHAT?

1273
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:05,861
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TWO GIRLS

1274
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,695
WEAVE IN THEIR CAMP.

1275
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,823
NO, THAT WAS NOT TRUE.

1276
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,282
SO I WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE ALL

1277
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,826
THE FACTS HERE ARE COMPLETELY

1278
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,201
FALSE, OKAY.

1279
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:12,785
THE GUYS--

1280
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,953
THEN WHY DID YOU--

1281
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:14,995
SHH!

1282
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,705
BECAUSE YOU'RE WRONG!

1283
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,123
OKAY?

1284
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,666
SO SHUT UP!

1285
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,333
REALLY?

1286
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:19,708
REALLY.

1287
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,543
REALLY?

1288
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,002
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE

1289
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:22,670
FACTS RIGHT.

1290
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,295
OKAY, I WAS STANDING THERE.

1291
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,381
WELL YOU KNOW WHO, IF THIS

1292
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,632
GAME IS ALL ABOUT--

1293
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,635
STOP, STOP, STOP.

1294
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,679
COME ON.

1295
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,472
DO YOU WANT TO TELL YOUR SIDE

1296
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,056
OR NOT.

1297
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,683
WE GOT A FIRE PIT AND A

1298
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,686
BETTER PIT THAN WE COULD HAVE

1299
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,188
CREATED.

1300
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,690
Jeff: CHELSEA, DO YOU GUYS

1301
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,316
NEED TO OPERATE FIRST AS A GROUP

1302
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,527
OF WOMEN BEFORE ANYBODY GOES

1303
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,154
INTO THE ENEMY TERRITORY OR IS

1304
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:48,863
IT, HEY, EVERYBODY IS PLAYING

1305
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,366
THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL GAME, DO

1306
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,033
WHAT YOU WANT?

1307
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,410
EVERYBODY IS DOING WHAT THEY

1308
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,119
WANT.

1309
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:55,828
I THINK EVEN IF WE SAID LET'S

1310
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,705
TALK ABOUT EVERY SINGLE THING WE

1311
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,124
NEED TO DECIDE ON AS A GROUP, IT

1312
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,041
STILL WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

1313
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:01,625
IT'S WOMEN.

1314
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,086
WE CAN'T ALL AGREE ON

1315
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,045
EVERYTHING, AND THAT'S JUST PART

1316
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:05,588
OF IT.

1317
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,338
Jeff: AND, MONICA, IT

1318
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,215
DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE'S ANY

1319
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:08,883
LEADER.

1320
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,758
UN, IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHATEVER

1321
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,178
IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US THAT HAS

1322
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,221
TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW TAKES

1323
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:14,638
PRECEDENT.

1324
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,222
IT'S CRAZY.

1325
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,391
IT'S TOTALLY ANARCHY.

1326
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:18,058
Jeff: AND YOU'RE LAUGHING

1327
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,727
ABOUT IT LIKE IT'S KIND OF

1328
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,436
FUNNY.

1329
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,729
BUT WHAT'S NOT FUNNY IS COMING

1330
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,354
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1331
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,732
YOU'VE GOT HUGE ANIMOSITY

1332
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,400
BETWEEN AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE.

1333
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:27,860
YOU HAVE NO STRUCTURE.

1334
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,529
AND RIGHT NOW, THE GUYS ARE

1335
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,405
THINKING THOSE WOMEN ARE ALL

1336
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,114
OVER THE MAP.

1337
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,074
WE HAVE THEM RIGHT WHERE WE WANT

1338
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,744
THEM-- NUTSVILLE.

1339
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,411
OKAY.

1340
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:40,414
LET ME GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON

1341
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,081
KOURTNEY.

1342
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,875
SOME GOOD NEWS AND SOME BAD

1343
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,667
NEWS.

1344
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,877
SHE'S DOING FINE.

1345
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,920
SHE'S IN GOOD SPIRITS.

1346
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:50,424
BUT HER WRIST IS BROKEN IN A FEW

1347
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:51,008
PLACES.

1348
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,051
IT WILL REQUIRE SURGERY.

1349
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:55,804
AND SHE IS OUT OF THE GAME.

1350
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,265
THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.

1351
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,642
THE GOOD NEWS, NOBODY ELSE IS

1352
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,769
GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1353
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,979
IN ADDITION, BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN

1354
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,773
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, YOU'LL NOW GO

1355
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,440
BACK WITH FIRE.

1356
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,234
YEAH!

1357
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:08,859
( APPLAUSE )

1358
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,361
Jeff: AND AS I SEND YOU ON

1359
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,695
YOUR WAY, I'D SAY THERE'S A

1360
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,280
LITTLE MORE GOOD NEWS AND A

1361
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,114
LITTLE MORE BAD NEWS.

1362
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,783
THE OTHER GOOD NEWS SIT'S ONLY

1363
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,617
DAY THREE.

1364
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,826
PLENTY OF TIME TO TURN THINGS

1365
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,535
AROUND.

1366
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,080
BAD NEWS, THERE ARE 36 DAYS LEFT

1367
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,790
IN THIS GAME, AND IF YOU DON'T

1368
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,291
GET IT TOGETHER, NONE OF YOU

1369
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,418
WILL MAKE IT TO THE END.

1370
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,795
THAT'S WHAT I SEND YOU HOME WITH

1371
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,254
TONIGHT.

1372
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:28,754
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1373
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,129
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1374
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:40,808
GOOD NIGHT.

1375
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,392
JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1376
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,309
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1377
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,522
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1378
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,106
"SURVIVOR: THE WOMEN OF SALANI

1379
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,150
GO FROM BAD TO WORSE.

1380
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,402
WOMEN COMPLETELY FALLING APART.

1381
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,570
RIGHT NOW WE LOOK LIKE

1382
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,154
IDIOTS.

1383
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,155
Jeff: AND COLTON IS ON AN

1384
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:55,823
ISLAND OF HIS OWN.

1385
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,199
COLTON IS THE WORST PERSON

1386
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,158
FOR OUR TRIBE.

1387
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,994
COLTON IS A VIRUS.

1388
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,496
IF YOU WANT TO MESS WITH ME,

1389
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,706
BY ALL MEANS, BUT YOU AIN'T

1390
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,833
GONNA WIN.

1391
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,714
I'M NOT SO PROUD OF MYSELF

1392
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,465
RIGHT NOW.

1393
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,800
BUT IT KIND OF WASN'T MY FAULT

1394
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:15,509
BUT IT WAS.

1395
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:17,678
I FEEL LIKE IF I HAD MOVED MY

1396
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,514
ARM OUT A LITTLE FARTHER I

1397
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:22,099
WOULDN'T BE IN THE SITUATION I

1398
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,851
AM RIGHT NOW.

1399
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,021
BUT IF MY SON SEES SOMETHING

1400
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,022
POSITIVE ABOUT ME FROM THIS

1401
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,189
EXPERIENCE I WOULD LIKE TO THINK

1402
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,274
HE THINKS I'M A STRONG WOMAN
