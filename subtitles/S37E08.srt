1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,570
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:10,110
"SURVIVOR," AFTER THE MERGE, THE
GOLIATHS HAD THE ADVANTAGE.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,344
THE NUMBERS ARE 7-6.

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,413
WE NEED TO STAY GOLIATH STRONG.

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,449
Jeff: BUT AN ALLIANCE
FORMED ACROSS TRIBAL LINES.

6
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,951
WE HAVE A SOLID SIX.

7
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,019
THREE FORMER DAVIDS.

8
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:19,919
THREE FORMER GOLIATHS.

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,821
ID CALL IT A STRIKE FORCE.

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,891
Jeff: FACING TRIBAL
COUNCIL, THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS

11
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:25,492
TARGET.

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,027
WE ALL WANT ELIZABETH.

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,362
Jeff: BUT ANGELINA SPOILED
"THE BLIND SIDE."

14
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,764
THEYRE THROWING YOUR NAME
OUT THERE.

15
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,965
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU.

16
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,602
I APPRECIATE IT.

17
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:39,506
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
ELIZABETH OUTED ANGELINA.

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,475
ANGELINA TOLD ME TODAY THAT
SHE WAS GOING TO BE VOTED FOR

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,911
ME.

20
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,480
THEYRE USING ME TO GET THE
NUMBERS BACK.

21
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:51,084
OBVIOUSLY YOU THINK WERE
GOING TO SIT HERE AND GET PICKED

22
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:51,751
OFF ONE BY ONE.

23
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,520
I DONT, I DONT.

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,355
Jeff: AND PUT THE SPOTLIGHT
ON ANGELINA.

25
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,724
I THINK SHE WAS STARTING TO
MANAGE THE JURY FOR HER FINAL

26
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:58,091
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

27
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,025
I AGREE.

28
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,628
Jeff: BUT ELIZABETH
COULDNT SAVE HERSELF.

29
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:05,365
ELIZABETH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

30
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,599
12 ARE LEFT.

31
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:11,704
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

32
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,474
Captioning funded by CBS

33
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,651
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS A DOOZY.

34
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:30,256
I DID NOT EXPECT ELIZABETH TO
DRAG MY NAME THROUGH THE MUD.

35
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,561
SHE MANIPULATED SOMETHING THAT
WASNT.

36
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,597
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE
WANTED HER OUT.

37
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,933
TELLING ELIZABETH IT WAS HER
NAME ON THE BLOCK WAS JURY

38
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:40,600
MANAGE.

39
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,435
, AND I GOT CAUGHT RED HANDED.

40
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,640
SO I NEED TO REASSURE EVERYONE
THAT THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

41
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:52,512
I WALKED TOWARD THE WATER LINE,
AND SHE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE

42
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,747
FOREST, AND SHE WAS BADGERING ME
FOR A NAME.

43
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,017
ITS SUPER FRUSTRATING BECAUSE
IT WAS A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

44
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,953
IT WASNT A MOMENT OF STRATEGY.

45
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,554
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IM SAYING?

46
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,024
AND FOR HER TO SAY I TOOK HER
ASIDE AND TOLD HER IT WAS HER,

47
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,826
THATS JUST IN THE TRUE.

48
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,561
OKAY.

49
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:13,433
ANGELINA TRIES THE MAKE UP
SOME STORY THAT, WAH, CRY, ITS

50
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,237
NOT MY FAULT, I HAD A MOMENT OF
WEAKNESS.

51
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,238
LIKE REALLY?

52
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,173
SHES MORE OF A THREAT THAN I
THOUGHT SHE WAS.

53
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:20,807
I DIDNT KNOW HER.

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,109
ANGELINA, YOU SLIMEBALL.

55
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,945
THAT WAS 100% A JURY
MANAGEMENT.

56
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,282
I AM NOT FOR ONE MINUTE
BUYING THAT LIE.

57
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,384
IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE I
SAW THEM GO TO THE WELL.

58
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,019
YOU WERE WORKING THE JURY.

59
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,521
YOU WENT AND TALKED TO HER.

60
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,456
THATS ALL THERE IS TO IT.

61
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,925
MY EYES WERE BIG AND SHE
FIGURED IT OUT.

62
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,228
THATS WHERE I HAVE EVEN MORE
OF A PROBLEM, IF YOURE NOT

63
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,099
GOING TO OWN YOUR MISTAKES AND
SAY, HEY, I TRIED MAKE A BOLD

64
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,168
MOVE, IT BACKFIRED, IM SORRY.

65
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,471
IF YOURE NOT WILLING TO DO
THAT, THEN I CANT TRUST YOU, SO

66
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:56,442
AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED, THE
FIRST OPPORTUNITY I GET, SHES

67
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:02,682
GONE.

68
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,351
IT WAS CRAZY.

69
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,421
ANGELINA BLEW UP HER OWN SPOT
EFFECTIVELY.

70
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,523
THAT WAS THE ONE TAKEAWAY I HAD.

71
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,494
BUT ANGELINA IN A WAY, NOW SHES
KIND OF BEEN DEFANGED OR

72
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:20,733
SOMETHING, BECAUSE ITS LIKE THE
JIG IS UP I GUESS.

73
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:25,104
THE SIX, WE HAVENT TALKED THAT
MUCH SINCE WEVE BROUGHT UP THE

74
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,372
SIX OR WHATEVER.

75
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,541
WE CAN TALK NOW IF THATS
OKAY.

76
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,510
I WAS LEGIT ABOUT ALL THAT.

77
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,112
AND LIKE IM TOTALLY ON THE
LEVEL ABOUT IT.

78
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,847
THIS SIX IS AWESOME.

79
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,149
YES.

80
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,953
IVE BEEN CALLING IT THE
STRIKE FORCE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

81
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,454
ABILITY TO STRIKE ANYWHERE AND
WITH ANYONE.

82
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,191
THE STRIKE FORCE OF SIX CONSISTS
OF THREE FORMER DAVIDS AND THREE

83
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,092
FORMER GOLIATHS.

84
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,062
WE GOT MYSELF, GABBY, AND NICK
ON ONE SIDE.

85
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:53,266
ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE MIKE,
ALISON, AND ALEC.

86
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,102
OUR PRIMARY STRATEGY IS TO VOTE
OUT ONE OF THE GOLIATHS.

87
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,405
RIGHT NOW THEY SEEM AMENABLE TO
VOTE ANG LEE NARCOTIC BUT I

88
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,308
THINK THIS WILL BE A PIVOTAL
TEST OF TRUST FOR THE STRIKE

89
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:02,742
FORCE.

90
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,444
WERE INSEAR.

91
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,479
I HOPE YOURE SINCERE.

92
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,249
GABBY AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS
MAKING ME FEEL LIKE SHES NOT

93
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,185
REALLY TAKING THIS ALLIANCE
SERIOUSLY OR SHE WOULDNT BE SO

94
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,787
ANGRY, TALKING ABOUT THE DAVIDS,
LIKE THEYRE PICKING US OFF ONE

95
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,922
BY ONE.

96
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,957
ITS LIKE, OKAY, YOU CLEARLY
DONT BELIEVE ANYTHING WEVE

97
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,192
BEEN TELLING YOU.

98
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:23,029
RIGHT NOW THERE IS THIS SIX, BUT
THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME OF THE

99
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,598
THINGS GABBY WAS SAYING LAST
NIGHT ACTUALLY MADE ME FEEL LIKE

100
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,533
SHES NOT FULLY ON BOARD.

101
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,503
MAYBE THESE DAVIDS ARE REALLY
THINKING ALONG TRIBAL LINES IN

102
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,339
WAYS THAT I WASNT THINKING
ABOUT.

103
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,377
I KNOW YOURE TIGHT WITH HER,
BUT THAT WAS MY ONLY ANXIOUS

104
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:37,977
TAKEAWAY.

105
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,145
ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?

106
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,116
GABBY DOES GET EMOTIONAL AT
TIME, BUT WE ARE SOLID.

107
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,552
MIKE HAS CONCERNS ABOUT GABBY IN
THAT HE WAS A LITTLE WORRIED

108
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:52,091
ABOUT GAB YESS COMMITMENT TO
THE SIX.

109
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,093
THATS A WEIRD THING TO SAY.

110
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,064
AT LEAST HE TOLD ME, THOUGH.

111
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,433
THERE ARE SO MANY TREES.

112
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,336
MAYBE IT WILL BE LIKE A COCONUT
OR WHATEVER.

113
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,205
MAYBE THERE WILL BE SOMETHING
UNDER THOSE MURKY WATERS.

114
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,974
MAYBE.

115
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:12,745
AT THIS POINT THE DAVIDS ARE
DOWN NUMBERS.

116
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,683
SO EVEN THOUGH ANGELINA IS IN
TROUBLE, ME AND DAVIE WENT OUT

117
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,784
TO FIND AN IDOL.

118
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,887
LOOK FOR SOMETHING OUT OF
PLACE, STRING OR ANYTHING.

119
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,222
WHATS THIS?

120
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:28,961
DUDE.

121
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,366
YES!

122
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,400
WHAT IS THAT?

123
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,502
SURE ENOUGH WE SEE A BLUE
RIBBON.

124
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:41,474
SO WE UNRAVEL IT, AND ITS THIS
BEAUTIFUL SYMBOL I REMEMBER FROM

125
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,111
THE MERGE THAT LOOKS LIKE A COOL
80s DESIGN I COULD PUT ON A

126
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,179
T-SHIRT.

127
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:51,284
SO IM LIKE, OKAY, WELL, WHAT IS
IT?

128
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,220
IM THINKING WE GOT TO FIND A
PALM TREE STICKING OUT ON A

129
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,054
CLIFF.

130
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,656
ITS ALL STARTING TO COME
TOGETHER.

131
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,523
THIS IS A CLUE.

132
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,058
ALL RIGHT.

133
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,961
WE NEED TO START LOOKING AROUND
THIS ISLAND.

134
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,664
PALM TREE AND A CLIFF.

135
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,935
SO WE COME OUT OF THE TRAIL
ON THE BEACH, AND THEN MY BOY

136
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,672
CARL COMES AND JOINS US.

137
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:18,277
AND THEN WE SAW A FREAKIN PALM
TREE COMING OUT OF A CLIFF LIKE

138
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,614
THE SYMBOL ON THE FREAKIN
WHATEVER THE THING IS WE JUST

139
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,584
FOUND, AND BECAUSE THESE OTHER
PEOPLE ARE RIGHT THERE, WHAT I

140
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:28,588
DID WAS I LET THEM CONTINUE TO
JUST WALK WHILE I KIND OF JUST

141
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,358
CREATED A DIVERSION TO MAKE THEM
THINK THAT IM JUST OUT HERE

142
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,292
ENJOYING LIFE.

143
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,627
LOOK AT DAVIE?

144
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,996
WHAT IS HE DOING?

145
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,797
TAE KWON DO?

146
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,367
IM OVER HERE DOING MY OWN
THING.

147
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:46,406
MEANTIME, I KNOW NICK IS GUNG
HO, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM.

148
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,411
I GET TO THE TREE, AND I SEE
A LITTLE RIBBON TIED AROUND THE

149
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,148
PARCHMENT JUST THE WAY THIS CLUE
WAS HIDDEN.

150
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:55,848
"CONGRATULATIONS.

151
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,049
YOU NOW HAVE POWER IN THE GAME.

152
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,552
THIS ADVANTAGE ALLOWS YOU TO
STEAL THE VOTE FROM ANOTHER

153
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,720
PLAYER AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

154
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,923
THE PLAYER WHOSE VOTE YOU STEAL
WILL NOT VOTE.

155
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:12,899
EN STEAD YOU WILL CAST A SECOND
VOTE."

156
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:18,438
HE HAS AN ADVANTAGE.

157
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,840
YOU HAVE AN IDOL NULLIFIER.

158
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,409
OH, MY GOD, DUDE, WE ARE SET.

159
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,646
THIS COULD BE MY SLINGSHOT THAT
I USE TO TAKE DOWN A GOLIATH.

160
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:30,082
I MEAN, THIS COULD BE THE STONE
THAT GOES RIGHT TO ITS HEAD.

161
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,817
WE FOUND AN ADVANTAGE.

162
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,185
WE FOUND AN ADVANTAGE.

163
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,085
WE GET AN EXTRA VOTE.

164
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,220
OKAY.

165
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,021
PERFECT.

166
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,722
WEVE GOT AN ADVANTAGE IN THE
GAME.

167
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,059
ANOTHER ONE.

168
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,362
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I GOT A
FREAKIN IDOL, MY VERY OWN, NO

169
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,498
ONE ELSE KNOWS.

170
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,200
WEVE GOT TWO ADVANTAGES.

171
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,068
WE HAVE AN IDOL NULLIFIER.

172
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:53,372
CARL HAS THE IDOL NULLIFIER,
WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO SMASH ANY

173
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:58,945
IDOLS THAT ARE PLAYED, AND NOW

IF AT ANY POINT A SANDBAG DROPS,
THAT TROUGH WILL DUMP, AND YOUR

185
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,734
SHOT AT VICTORY WILL WASH AWAY.

00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,049
EVERYBODY LOOKING GOOD.

00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:25,091
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

226
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,893
GABBY WAS A CAPTAIN.

YOU MUST ALWAYS BE HOLDING ONE

231
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:52,018

Jeff: EVERY 15 MINUTES ONE
PLAYER WILL DROP OUT AND HAVE TO

235
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,361
GIVE THEIR SANDBAG TO SOMEONE
ELSE.

236
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,031
SO THE LONGER THIS CHALLENGE
GOES, THE MORE WEIGHT YOURE

237
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,699

351
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,037
WE START EATING RIGHT THERE IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE.

352
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,707
WE CANT LOSE WHATEVER WE HAD
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

353
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,508
TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

354
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:21,847
IM HAPPY TO START IN ON THE
RICE IF YOU WANT THE TAG TEAM.

355
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,750
SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND KILL
THE CHICKEN?

356
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:30,556
WHEN WHEN WE LOST THE REWARD,
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT IM NOT

357
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,626
HERE FOR REWARD AND IM HERE TO
GET TO THE END OF THE GAME.

358
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,696
OTHER PEOPLE GET CAUGHT UP IN
THE MOMENT OF THE PIZZA AND THEY

359
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,900
FORGET WHAT THE REAL DRAMA IS
HERE, WHICH IS STAYING IN THE

360
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,102
GAME.

361
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,238
HOW DO YOU OUTLAST EVERYONE
ELSE?

362
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,340
FOR ME THAT IS MY FOCUS.

363
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,910
AND SO I FELL LIKE I NEEDED TO
TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK AT

364
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,112
ALL MY OPTIONS.

365
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:57,816
I HAVE A GOLIATH ALLIANCE, AND I
HAVE A NEW ALLIANCE OF SIX,

366
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,953
WHICH INCLUDES THREE GOLIATHS
AND THREE DAVIDS.

367
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,223
BUT IM STARTING TO REALIZE THAT
IF I GO WITH THE SIX, THERES

368
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,793
THE RISK THE DAVIDS MIGHT PULL A
FAST ONE ON ME, TAKE CONTROL OF

369
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,128
THE GAME AND SCREW ME OVER.

370
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:16,201
I WANT THE MAKE SURE THAT THAT
DOESNT HAPPEN.

371
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,469
OKAY.

372
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,038
HERE IS THE THING, MY FEAR IS WE
VOTE OUT ANGELINA NOW, THERE IS

373
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:24,143
STILL ROOM FOR SOMETHING THAT WE
CANT CONTROL COULD HAPPEN.

374
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,279
BECAUSE THE PERSON LEFT ON THE
FIELD THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS

375
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,315
TO WIN THE GAME IS CHRISTIAN.

376
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,352
HES ONE OF THOSE GUYS IN A WEEK
WERE TO WEEKS, YOURE GOING TO

377
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,355
BE LIKE, WHY DID WE NOT TAKE
THIS I GO OUT WHEN WE HAD THE

378
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:36,722
CHANCE.

379
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,057
YEAH.

380
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,060
CHRISTIAN IS SOMEBODY I
WANTED TO WORK WITH, BUT I WORRY

381
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:45,064
BECAUSE I THINK HES JUST AS
SMART AS I AM AND CAN ACTUALLY

382
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:49,168
PULL SOME MOVES I DONT SEE
COMING.

383
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:54,339
LIKE CARL AND DAVIE, THEYRE NOT
GOING TO MOUNT SOMEN VUX, --

384
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,941
UNSURE REST, AND GABI COULDNT
GET PEOPLE TO FOLLOW HER INTO

385
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,843
BATTLE BUT CHRISTIAN COULD.

386
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:06,718
HES THE LAST PERSON WHO COULD
WEASEL HIS WAY TO THE END.

387
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,054
THATS MY TWO CORRECTS ON THAT.

388
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,291
MIKE WANTS TO BLOW UP THE
ALLIANCE OF SIX BY VOTING OUT

389
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,961
CHRISTIAN AND JUST CONTINUE TO
BE GOLIATH STRONG FOR NOW.

390
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,663
AND TAKE OUT A BIG THREAT.

391
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:22,401
I TOTALLY HEAR HIS POINT, BUT IF
WE DO THIS, IM LOCKED IN WITH

392
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:28,607
THE GOLIATHS, AN I DONT KNOW IF
THATS BEST FOR MY GAME.

393
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,711
THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS LIKE A
STRONG PLAYER OUT HERE BESIDES

394
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:33,479
US IS CHRISTIAN.

395
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,047
CHRISTIAN.

396
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,585
ANYBODY WATCHING THIS SEASON,
EITHER THEYRE ROOTING FOR

397
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,621
CHRISTIAN AND THEYRE LIKE, WHY
ARENT THEY TAKING OUT THAT GUY.

398
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,156
HES EVERYBODYS FAVORITE
GUY.

399
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,792
SO WE TAKE HIM OUT NEXT, NO
MORE DISCUSSION.

400
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,494
NO MORE RUNNING AROUND TOMORROW.

401
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,094
THATS THE PLAN.

402
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,563
THIS WAS MY PLAN.

403
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,931
THIS WAS MY IDEA.

404
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,902
I WAS TRYING TO LEAD THE CHARGE
ON CHRISTIAN LAST VOTE, AND NOW

405
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,973
I AM HAVING FLASHBACKS TO ALL
THOSE TIMES, EITHER ME OR

406
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:05,444
ANOTHER WOMAN HAD THROWN OUT AN
IDEA AND A FEW MINUTES LATER A

407
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,046
MAN THROWS OUT THE SAME IDEA AND
EVERYBODY IS LIKE, THATS A

408
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,914
GREAT IDEA.

409
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,282
LETS DO THAT.

410
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,820
AND YOURE LIKE, UM, I JUST SAID
THAT A FEW MINUTES AGO.

411
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,688
YOU GUYS KNOW I WANT THIS.

412
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,891
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHAT
WERE GOING TO TELL HIM.

413
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,727
THE ONLY THING HES GOING THE
BELIEVE IS --

414
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,665
WHY DON WE STAY TIGHT-LIPPED
AND SAY NOTHING.

415
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,568
BECAUSE AFTER LAST NIGHTS
FIASCO, HES GOING THE BELIEVE

416
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,736
IT.

417
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,005
DONT YOU WANT TO BE THE STAR
OF ANOTHER TRIBAL COUNCIL,

418
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,139
ANGELINA.

419
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,408
ID RATHER NOTING BUT IF
THATS WHAT WEVE GOT TO DO,

420
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,643
THATS WHAT WEVE GOT TO DO.

421
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,712
BECAUSE MY NAME WAS THROWN
OUT THERE SO MUCH LAST TRIBAL, I

422
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:46,852
AM THE DECOY IN ORDER FOR US TO
BLINDSIDE CHRISTIAN, YET VERY

423
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,354
EASILY I COULD BECOME THE REAL
DEAL, BECAUSE SINCE WERE

424
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,392
TELLING THE DAVIDS TO VOTE FOR
ME, IF SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENS,

425
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,428
IT COULD BE THE DEMISE OF MY
GAME.

426
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:24,389
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

427
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,257

00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:49,881

PERCH OR YOUR BUOY DROPS, YOURE

436
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,083

EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD, AND THIS
CHALLENGE IS ON.

448
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,558
THIS COULD GO VERY FAST.

449

WEVE DONE THIS CHALLENGE ONE
TIME, IN "GAME CHANGERS."

450
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,565
BRAD CULPEPPER WON IT IN 23
MINUTES.

451
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,700
MY HERO.

452
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:45,604
Jeff: YOU ARE NOT YET 23
SECONDS.

453
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,708

456
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,917
KARA WILL TAKE A SPOT ON THE

A LONG WAY AWAY FROM WHERE BRAD

TOGETHER AS THE DYSFUNCTIONAL

523
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,201
GOLIATH FAMILY WE ARE.

524
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,904
I JUST HOPE THE GOLIATHS CAN
KEEP THEIR EGOS IN CHECK AN WE

525
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,505
CAN MAKE THIS WORK.

526
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:57,022
CONGRATULATION, DAN.

527
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,257
CONGRATS, DAN.

528
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,759
THAT WAS HARD.

529
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,727
GOOD JOB, ANGELINA.

530
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,596
LASER FOCUSED.

531
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,897
EPIC WIN.

532
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,633
I WAS LOCKED IN, DUDE.

533
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,369
I WAS LIKE, IM NOT LETTING
ANGELINA BEAT ME.

534
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,837
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

535
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,772
APPRECIATE IT.

536
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,807
THE VOTE IS GOING TO BE EASY
TONIGHT.

537
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,142
IM GUESSING THERE IS A PLAN.

538
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:17,909
ANGELINA.

539
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,679
ANGELINA.

540
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,315
CANT HAVE THOSE KIND OF
SHENANIGANS.

541
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,352
TONIGHTS VOTE IS GOING TO BE
A HUGE SHOCK FOR THE DAVIDS.

542
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,088
THE STORY WEVE BEEN TELLING
THEM IS EVERYONE IS GOING TO

543
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,925
VOTE OUT ANGELINA, BUT WHAT
ACTUALLY IS HAPPENING IS THE

544
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:38,096
GOLIATHS ARE ALL ON THE SAME
PAGE TONIGHT TO VOTE OUT

545
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,197
CHRISTIAN, AND IT SUCKS.

546
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,767
HES AN HONORARY BROCHACHO, BUT
HES SMART.

547
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,702
HES CHARISMATIC.

548
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:44,569
HES GOOD SOCIALLY.

549
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,539
AND BECAUSE OF THAT HES A
THREAT.

550
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:54,846
SO TONIGHT ITS GOING TO BE A
#BROCHACHOBLINDSIDE.

551
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,948
HARD TO BE IN THE HOT SEAT.

552
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,217
EVEN IF ITS A PRESUMABLY FAKE
HOT SEAT.

553
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,654
I GET IT, BUT YOU NEED TO
KEEP IT SIMPLE, BECAUSE IF WE

554
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:06,591
TRY TO GET ALL CRAZY, THATS
WHEN STUFF GOES AWRY.

555
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,160
I KNOW IT DOESNT FEEL GOOD TO
HAVE YOUR NAME BEING THROWN OUT,

556
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,197
THERE BUT WE HAVE SEVEN OF US
AGAINST FIVE OF THEM.

557
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,431
OKAY.

558
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,368
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, MY NAME IS

559
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,535
ON PEOPLES LIPS.

560
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,440
IF THE DAVIDS HAVE ANY SORT OF
POWER, A.K.A. AN IDOL, THEY

561
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,876
COULD PROTECT CHRISTIAN, IN
WHICH CASE, THE NEXT RUNNER-UP

562
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:25,510
IS ME.

563
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,212
ITS JUST VERY STRESSFUL.

564
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,482
BUT ANGELINA, YOURE THE ONE
THAT MESSED UP.

565
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:31,416
NO, LISTEN TO ME.

566
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,817
YOU MESSED UP, RIGHT?

567
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:38,089
AND IF CHRISTIAN WHIPS OUT AN
IDOL, ILL PULL OUT THE IDOL AND

568
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,424
GIVE IT TO YOU.

569
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,558
ITS NOT A PROBLEM.

570
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,995
I DONT WANT YOU GONE.

571
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,697
DUDE, SHES GOT TO GO.

572
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,665
ANGELINA?

573
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,866
YEAH.

574
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,736
ITS JUST WE NEED TO GET A
DAVID OUT BEFORE WE TAKE HER.

575
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,206
MY QUESTION IS, CHRISTIAN BUSTS
OUT AN IDOL --

576
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,308
I DONT THINK CHRISTIAN HAS
AN IDOL.

577
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,878
I DONT THINK HE DOES EITHER.

578
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:03,181
DO WE STILL GIVE IT TO ANGELINA
OR DO WE NOT?

579
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,450
IM SAYING NEW YORK BECAUSE
WE STILL HAVE THE NUMBERS AT

580
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,285
THAT POINT.

581
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,753
YOU DOWN WITH THAT?

582
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:09,688
YOU GOOD WITH THAT?

583
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,488
OKAY.

584
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,057
I WOULD LOVE TO GET ANGELINA
OUT.

585
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,694
ANGELINA IS A THREAT, AN SHE
DOES NEED TO GO.

586
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,129
BUT IF EVERYONES GOING TO VOTE
FOR CHRISTIAN, IM GOING TO HAVE

587
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,397
TO GO WITH IT.

588
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:23,368
HOWEVER, I DONT WANT NICK TO
FEEL BLINDSIDED BY THIS VOTE.

589
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,136
NICK AND I HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP.

590
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:30,842
I DONT WANT TO LOSE HIS TRUST.

591
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,278
I GOT TO BE 100% HONEST WITH
YOU?

592
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,312
UH-HUH.

593
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,448
THEYRE BLINDSIDING
CHRISTIAN.

594
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:42,087
MIKE IS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT
CHRISTIAN.

595
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,388
CHRISTIAN WOULD BEAT US.

596
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,289
UH-HUH.

597
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:50,595
I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON
WITH MIKE.

598
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,796
I THOUGHT WE WERE ON THE SAME
PAGE.

599
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,732
WELL, NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN HE
WANTS CHRISTIAN OUT IMMEDIATELY.

600
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,935
IM LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
ALLIANCE OF SIX.

601
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:00,038
TRUST ME, LIKE IM GOING
AGAINST MY ALLIANCE IN A WAY.

602
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:08,646
YOU COULD VERY EASILY GO IF YOU
WANTED TO.

603
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,417
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE
PLAN FOR ANGELINA IS ON.

604
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,486
BRO.

605
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,254
TELL ME WHAT YOURE THINKING.

606
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:16,788
I THINK THEYRE FULL OF...

607
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,556
THEYRE LYING TO YOU.

608
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,659
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

609
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,728
YOU THINK ITS THAT
DESPERATE?

610
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,963
YEAH.

611
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,333
EVERYONE IS TALKING, OH, ITS
ANGELINA, ITS ANGELINA, ITS

612
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:32,137
ANGELINA, WHICH IS COMFORTLING
BUT EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS.

613
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,074
NOW NICK IS TELLING ME, THEYRE
LYING TO YOU, MAN, AND ALL OF A

614
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,077
SUDDEN IM WONDERING IF THE
GOLIATHS ARE THINKING, THAT

615
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,280
CHRISTIAN, HES WILEY, LETS GET
RID OF THEM.

616
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,450
LETS FIGURE OUT WHO THE
LEADER IS.

617
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,719
HOW DO WE DO IT WITHOUT A
GOLIATH VOTE.

618
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,889
JUST DONT DO NOTHING, JUST
WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING BEFORE

619
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:51,956
WE TALKED, KEEP DOING THAT.

620
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,892
DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY, MAN.

621
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,193
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

622
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,762
WHY WOULD THEY TURN ON ONE OF
THEIR OWN WHEN THEY COULD TAKE

623
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,398
OUT A BIG THREAT AND HAVE THE
DAVIDS ON THEIR KNEES.

624
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,100
IF THATS THE CASE, IM SCREWED.

625
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,102
I DONT HAVE AN IDOL.

626
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,270
I DONT HAVE IMMOONTY.

627
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:12,243
I GOT NOTHING.

628
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,480
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU,
DAVIE, WOULD YOU USE THE

629
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,548
ADVANTAGE TO SAVE CHRISTIAN?

630
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,749
HES IN TROUBLE?

631
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:22,921
YEAH.

632
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,123
WHY ARE THEY TALKING HIM
ALREADY?

633
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,860
THEYRE CONVINCED THAT HES
THIS HUGE THREAT.

634
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,529
LIKE I WAS HOPING TO SAVE IT
UNTIL WERE LIKE IN THE FINAL

635
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,967
SIX ORFINAL SEVEN OR SOMETHING,
BUT I DONT WANT THE SEE

636
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,202
CHRISTIAN GO.

637
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,271
IF THE GOLIATHS ARE GOING FOR
CHRISTIAN ALREADY, THAT MEANS

638
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,842
MAYBE THEIR PLAN IS TO PICK THE
DAVIDS OFF ONE BY ONE BY ONE BY

639
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,076
ONE.

640
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:49,547
NICK IS GOING ON ABOUT MAN WE
NEED TO USE THE STEAL-A-VOTE TO

641
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,483
SAVE CHRISTIAN, BUT THE ONLY
THING THAT CAN SAVE HIM FOR SURE

642
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:57,355
IS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL THAT
I HAVE IN MY POCK WHICH NICK

643
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,790
DOESNT KNOW ABOUT.

644
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,658
SO WILL YOU USE IT?

645
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,962
AT LEAST LETS THINK ABOUT
IT.

646
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,397
I WOULD LIKE THE HELP
CHRISTIAN, BUT THERE IS

647
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,034
DEFINITELY A PART SAYING, DAVIE,
YOURE NOT IN TROUBLE, SAVE YOUR

648
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,002
IDOL.

649
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,272
MAYBE IF WE USE THE
STEAL-A-VOTE, WE CAN MAKE

650
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,307
SOMETHING HAPPEN.

651
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,783
IM NOT READY TO SEE
CHRISTIAN GO.

652
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,518
HES PART OF THE MASON-DIXON.

653
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,953
I HAVE SOME MOVES STILL.

654
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,824
I COULD USE MY ADVANTAGE, STEAL
A GOLIATHS VOTE AND CAUSE A TIE

655
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:33,958
VOTE.

656
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,727
ITS POSSIBLE IT COULD WORK,
BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY AINT

657
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,264
GOING TO DRAW A ROCK FOR
ANGELINA, BUT IF I USE THIS TO

658
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,200
STEAL A GOLIATHS VOTE AN THEY
ALL STICK TOGETHER AND COME OUT

659
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,803
ON TOP, THEN IM SCREWED BECAUSE
ITS GOING TO BE ME NEXT.

660
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,805
IM SO UNDER THE RADAR RIGHT
NOW.

661
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,842
NOBODY IS LOOKING THE VOTE ME
OUT.

662
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,344
SO I GOT SOME DECISIONS TO MAKE.

663
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:57,382
AND IF I SCREW UP, IT COULD BE
MY DOWNFALL IN THIS GAME.

664
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:27,812
Jeff: WELL NOW BRING IN
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

665
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:36,354
ELIZABETH VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

666
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:40,325
SO ANGELINA, THE LAST TRIBAL WAS
A UNANIMOUS VOTE, BUT IT WAS

667
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,759
ANYTHING BUT UNITED.

668
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,461
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

669
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,230
Jeff: SO WHEN YOU GET BACK
THE CAMP, WHAT WENT DOWN WITH

670
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,332
YOU?

671
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,867
YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO MAKE
SURE THAT EVERYONE IN MY

672
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:54,105
ALLIANCE WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR ON
WHAT WENT DOWN, WHY IT WENT

673
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,608
DOWN, AND IM PUTTING A LOT OF
FAITH IN THE PEOPLE WHO SAID

674
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,245
THAT THEY HAVE FORGIVEN ME AND
ARE MOVING FORWARD, AND IM

675
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,147
HOPING THAT THAT IS THE TRUTH.

676
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,417
Jeff: NICK WAS THERE ANY
TALK AMONGST THE DAVIDS OF

677
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:11,189
SAYING, MAYBE ANGELINA, SHE TOOK
SOME HEAT LAST TRIBAL, MAYBE

678
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,991
SHES OUR CRACK.

679
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,928
OF COURSE, BUT IF THERE IS A
GOLIATH ALLIANCE, IT DONT

680
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,129
MATTER HOW MAD THEY ARE.

681
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,198
THEY MIGHT KEEP HER AROUND.

682
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,634
Jeff: MIKE, WHY NOT KEEP
GOLIATH SEVEN.

683
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,836
ITS FIVE EASY VOTES.

684
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,840
THERES AN ARGUMENT FOR, THAT
BUT THE DAVIDS HAVE BEEN AN

685
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,242
INFLUENCE THE LAST VOTE AND WILL
BE AN INFLUENCE TO THIS VOTE

686
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,012
TONIGHT, SO ITS A LOT MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

687
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,981
Jeff: DAVIE, SURPRISE YOU
TO HEAR MIKE SAY DAVIDS WERE

688
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,051
INVOLVED WITH THE ELIZABETH VOTE
AND THERE WILL BE DAVIDS

689
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,121
INVOLVED WITH TONIGHTS VOTE,
BECAUSE THAT DOESNT SOUND LIKE

690
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,289
GOLIATHS VERSUS DAVIDS.

691
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,858
ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.

692
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,327
ELIZABETH DID A GREAT THING.

693
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,695
SHE EXPOSED SOME CRACKS.

694
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,464
YOU HAD ALISON TALKING ABOUT
JURY MANAGEMENT.

695
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,501
YOU GOT ANGELINA TELLING
SECRETS.

696
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,370
SO, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO HOPE
THAT WHAT MIKE IS SAYING IS

697
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:00,171
TRUE.

698
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,739
I DONT BELIEVE IT ONE BIT,
JEFF.

699
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,007
THEY GOT THE NUMBERS, MAN.

700
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,275
WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO?

701
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:08,446
YOU CAN TELL A PERSON TRUST ME
ALL DAY LONG, BUT I TRUST YOU

702
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,149
MORE AFTER I SEE THE VOTES READ
VERSUS JUST SITTING HERE

703
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,083
TALKING.

704
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,485
Jeff: JOHN, THAT REALLY IS
IT.

705
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,888
YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE OTHER
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO.

706
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,323
YOU DONT KNOW IF THEYRE SAYING
THE TRUTH OR IF THEYRE PULLING

707
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,625
FAST ONE ON YOU.

708
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,160
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE ALL OF THAT?

709
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,063
ULTIMATELY YOU GET WHAT YOU
GIVE.

710
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:28,699
IF YOU DONT GIVE ANYTHING, YOU
DONT REALLY HAVE CHANCE OF

711
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,867
RECEIVING ANYTHING HONEST FROM
ANYBODY.

712
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,604
THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU GET
WHAT YOU GIVE, THEY HIGH JUST

713
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,705
GIVE YOU THAT BACK.

714
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,375
IF YOU GIVE TO THE WRONG
PERSON, THEN YOURE BONED.

715
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,310
IT WORK BOTH WAYS.

716
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,680
YOU DONT GANN TRUST JUST BY
BOSTON, PEOPLE AROUND OR TELLING

717
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,581
PEOPLE HOW TO VOTE.

718
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,217
IT HAS TO BE A GIVE AND TAKE
RELATIONSHIP.

719
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,353
AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE THAT
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME PEOPLE

720
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,621
HERE.

721
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,424
THEY KNOW THAT IM READY TO WORK
WITH THEM, NOT JUST TONIGHT, BUT

722
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,226
FOR THE REST OF THE GAME.

723
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,229
Jeff: JOHN, WHEN YOU HEAR
NICK SAY, I DONT CARE WHAT

724
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,265
HAPPENS TONIGHT, IM LOYAL, WHAT
DOES THAT SAY ABOUT WHERE WE ARE

725
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,500
IN THE GAME?

726
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,536
WELL, I DONT PERSONALLY KNOW
EXACTLY WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN

727
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,841
TONIGHT, BUT FOR ME, I AM FOR
VOTING OUT THREATS, BECAUSE WHEN

728
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,677
YOU RESPECT SOMEONE AS A THREAT,
THEY MIGHT NOT BE GOOD FOR YOUR

729
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,812
GAME AND IT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR
THEM TO GO.

730
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,216
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, GENERAL
SAYS FOR HIM ITS GETTING RID OF

731
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,317
THREATS.

732
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,653
I GO BACK TO DAY ONE, YOURE
SELECTED AS THE PERCEIVED

733
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,021
WEAKEST, TURNS OUT YOU WERENT.

734
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,424
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT YOU MIGHT
BE THE OBVIOUS TARGET?

735
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,426
OF COURSE THAT IS MY WORRY.

736
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,162
YOU NEVER WANT TO BE TOO MUCH OF
A THREAT IN THIS GAME.

737
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,396
WHAT DID I DO?

738
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,133
I JUST CAME OUT AND ANNOUNCED
MYSELF, HELLO, MY NAME IS THREAT

739
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,902
IN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES.

740
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,637
Jeff: BIG BANG THEORY THEY
CALL YOU.

741
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,707
BUT YOU WANT TO MANAGE YOUR
THREAT LEVEL IN "SURVIVOR."

742
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,609
THATS SOMETHING I NEGLECTED IN
THIS GAME.

743
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,677
AS A RESULT, I COULD BE AN
ENORMOUS TARGET.

744
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,748
BUT I JUST HAVE TO POINT OUT
THAT IN SPITE OF DAVID VERSUS

745
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:55,553
GOLIATH, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SOME
DAVIDS ON THE BROCHACHOS, AS

746
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,354
WELL.

747
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,522
Jeff: WHATS YOUR POINT
WITH THAT?

748
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:02,126
IM HOPING THAT THESE BONDS I
BUILT ACROSS THESE SWAPPED

749
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,261
TRIBES MEAN SOMETHING.

750
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:07,532
ALTHOUGH I WOULD ARGUE THAT
THATTEN CREASES HIS THREAT

751
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,733
ACTUALLY.

752
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,935
SO YOURE ARGUING, ANGELINA,
THAT IM AN ENORMOUS THREAT.

753
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,172
I WASNT PUTTING YOU OUT AT
THE BIGGEST.

754
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:18,042
BUT JUST SAID BIG THREAT AND
YOURE LIKE, ACTUALLY EVEN

755
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,110
BIGGER THREAT.

756
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,746
I WANT TO MAKE SURE --
 THATS WHAT YOU COAT TRIBAL

757
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,014
COUNCIL.

758
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,449
YOU ELEVATE OTHERS OVER YOURSELF
IN ORDER TO MOVE THE TARGET AWAY

759
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,584
FROM YOU.

760
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,853
MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND
PERFECTLY WHAT YOU MEAN, AND I

761
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:29,587
THINK YOUVE DONE THAT.

762
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,356
OF COURSE.

763
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,260
Jeff: ANGELINA, IS IT EVER
POSSIBLE TO HAVE A VOTE AND GO

764
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,662
BACK LUKE YOU WERE BEFORE THE
VOTE?

765
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,464
I THINK LAST VOTE WAS
PROBABLY THE LAST TIME THAT WE

766
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,034
WOULD GO BACK THE CAMP MELLOW
AND UNITED.

767
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,770
Jeff: SO THERE WILL BE A
CONSEQUENCE TO TONIGHTS VOTE?

768
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,941
THERE HAS TO BE, AND
DEPENDING ON WHERE THE LOOKS ARE

769
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,110
DRAWN, THERE WILL BE SOME HAPPY
PEOPLE AND SOME UNHAPPY PEOPLE.

770
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:58,583
AN WERE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO
SLEEP TOGETHER REGARDLESS.

771
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,083
NO ALL RIGHT.

772
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,619
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

773
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,655
NICK, YOURE UP.

774
00:37:54,438 --> 00:38:03,180
ILL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

775
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,124
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

776
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:23,968
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

777
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,805
WHAT?

778
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,907
CAN I SAY A FEW THINGS, JEFF?

779
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,975
SURE.

780
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,644
FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY
ALLIANCE, IM SORRY I HAD TO

781
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,880
HIDE THIS FROM YOU GUYS, BUT I
THINK YOULL UNDERSTAND.

782
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:42,887
AND IM NERVOUS, JEFF, BUT IM
NOR NERVOUS FOR CHRISTIAN.

783
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,388
THIS IS FOR HIM.

784
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,424
Jeff: OKAY.

785
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,175
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

786
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:17,722
ANY VOTES CAST FOR CHRISTIAN
WILL NOT COUNT.

787
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:21,058
I WANT THE TAKE CARE OF MY
ALLIANCE, TOO.

788
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:27,231
OH, MY GOD, DAN, I LOVE YOU.

789
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,233
I WANT THE PLAY THIS FOR
ANGELINA.

790
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:29,967
Jeff: OKAY.

791
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,969
OH, MY GOD.

792
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,838
DID YOU SAY WHO IT WAS FOR.

793
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,538
YEAH.

794
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:41,345
THANK YOU, DAN.

795
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,347
Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

796
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,816
ANY VOTES CAST FOR ANGELINA WILL
NOT COUNT.

797
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,584
WOW.

798
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,452
THATS MY ANGEL RIGHT THERE.

799
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,521
OH, MY GOD.

800
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,455
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

801
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:56,193
ILL READ THE VOTES.

802
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,830
THIS IS DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH.

803
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,799
Jeff: FIRST VOTE,
CHRISTIAN.

804
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,835
DOES NOT COUNT.

805
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:05,269
CHRISTIAN.

806
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:09,240
DOES NOT COUNT.

807
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:09,673
CHRISTIAN.

808
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:13,911
DOES NOT COUNT.

809
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,515
CHRISTIAN, DOES NOT COUNT.

810
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,851
CHRISTIAN, DOES NOT COUNT.

811
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:21,285
CHRISTIAN.

812
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:27,158
DOES NOT COUNT.

813
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:27,591
CHRISTIAN.

814
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:33,664
DOES NOT COUNT.

815
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:34,064
ANGELINA.

816
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,866

GOOD GAME, GUYS.

832
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:30,488
Jeff: JOHN, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,591

GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

840

00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,511
GOOD NIGHT.

Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

846
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,399
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR:" WHEN THERES A BAD

847
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,300
BREAKUP.

848
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,302
WALK AROUND THE BEACH AND
FIGURE IT OUT.

849
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,471
I HAVE TO SEPARATE MYSELF
FROM HIM.

850
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,739
Jeff: YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE
FIELD.

851
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,575
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS LIKE,
SHOULD I GO OVER THERE?

852
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,278
COME TO THE DAVID, COME TO
THE GOOD SIDE.

853
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,146
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS TRUST
ISSUES.

854
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,214
DAN IS GOING HOME.

855
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,982
THEYRE LYING TO MY FACE
AGAIN.

856
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,920
IN CLASSIC GOLIATH FASHION,
DAVID WITH THE SLING, TWO VOTES

857
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,388
FROM A DISTANCE.

858
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,023
THATS ALL IT TAKES THE TAKE
DOWN A GOLIATH IN THE GAME OF

859
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,124
"SURVIVOR."

860
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:45,696
IRONICALLY, I PREDICTED TONIGHT
A BROCHACHO BLINDSIDE.

861
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,667
I WAS TALKING ABOUT CHRISTIAN,
AND IT ENDED UP BEING ME.

862
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,702
SON OF A BITCH.
