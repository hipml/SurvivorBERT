<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,422
>> If you don't win immunity, if

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,131
you don't have that silly idol

5
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,383
from that goofy island, you're

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,175
gone.

7
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,093
>> PROBST: As the last two

8
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,720
remaining members of La Mina,

9
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:12,345
Sally and Terry faced an uphill

10
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,263
battle.

11
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,849
>> I am totally motivated to

12
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,225
kick your butts at everything

13
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,060
that comes down the road.

14
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,061
>> PROBST: Before the reward

15
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,354
challenge...

16
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,480
>> Hey, Dad, it's me.

17
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,565
I love you so much.

18
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,524
>> PROBST: ...everyone got a

19
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,692
glimpse of their loved ones.

20
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,276
Win today's reward challenge,

21
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,068
you get to see the rest of

22
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,612
your video and you'll enjoy

23
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,363
peanut butter and jelly

24
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,866
sandwiches and ice-cold milk.

25
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:33,783
Go!

26
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,951
>> Go! Go! Go! Go!

27
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,119
>> PROBST: Terry, Sally, Bruce,

28
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,746
and Courtney swung their way to

29
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,705
victory.

30
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,874
Reward for Courtney, Terry,

31
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,293
Bruce, and Sally.

32
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,294
You're sending one person to

33
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,086
Exile Island.

34
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,545
Who is it going to be?

35
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,297
>> Aras.

36
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,549
>> PROBST: On Exile Island,

37
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,593
Aras's search for the idol was

38
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,469
futile.

39
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,219
>> Terry's quickness to send me

40
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,430
might suggest that there is no

41
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,390
immunity idol out here.

42
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,516
>> PROBST: The immunity

43
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,310
challenge began with a twist.

44
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,520
If immunity is just not that

45
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,938
important to you, you don't have

46
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,981
to take part in today's

47
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,024
challenge.

48
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,319
Instead, you can chow down.

49
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,737
>> Doh!

50
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,988
>> PROBST: Aras, Terry, and

51
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,656
Sally passed on the offer and

52
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,408
went head to head for immunity,

53
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,910
while the rest of the tribe

54
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,327
gorged themselves on

55
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,953
cheeseburgers.

56
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,829
>> Here you go.

57
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,955
>> PROBST: Terry wins immunity

58
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,832
for the third straight time!

59
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,503
>> Yes!

60
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,629
>> PROBST: Before Tribal

61
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,338
Council, the Casaya members were

62
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,255
unified.

63
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,508
>> So we go Sally six-nothing

64
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:31,758
tonight?

65
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,342
>> PROBST: But the threat of

66
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,552
Terry giving the immunity idol

67
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,971
to Sally made Aras vulnerable.

68
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,389
>> It's possible that I could

69
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,307
go home today.

70
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,642
If Sally ends up having the

71
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,477
hidden immunity idol, then Sally

72
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,770
and Terry's vote will knock

73
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,188
somebody out.

74
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,523
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

75
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,357
Council, Terry strategically

76
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,234
kept the hidden immunity idol,

77
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,903
and his last ally, Sally, was

78
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,863
voted out of the tribe.

79
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,280
Seven are left.

80
00:01:54,364 --> 00:02:03,331
Who will be voted out tonight?

81
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,417
(theme song playing)

82
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,487
>> Sally voted out last night at

83
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,030
Tribal Council means that I'm

84
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,532
the only one left from La Mina.

85
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,199
I still have a huge target on

86
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,786
my back, and at the Tribal

87
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,371
Council, and after feeling

88
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,831
melancholy sitting around the

89
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,708
fire and having them ask me,

90
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,042
"Oh, is there something wrong?

91
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:48,960
You want to talk about it?"

92
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,211
I'm like, of course there's

93
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,838
something wrong, you know.

94
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,006
And, no, I don't want to talk

95
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,756
about it.

96
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,133
I'm bummed.

97
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:59,262
>> Come a long way, baby.

98
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,306
>> I know.

99
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,642
>> It's a good feeling.

100
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,435
>> I'm going to have to win

101
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,354
every one in from now on, at

102
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,106
least the next three out of four

103
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,399
to get to the four, and then

104
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,401
I've got my hidden immunity

105
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,111
idol.

106
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,195
That will get me by that, if I

107
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:16,779
I need to, to get to the final

108
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,405
three.

109
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,657
I kind of feel that once I get

110
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,034
to the final three, I think I've

111
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,452
got it over everybody here as

112
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,661
far as mental power and

113
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,289
strength.

114
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,290
>> Oh, no!

115
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,792
>> Oh, Shane!

116
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,919
Damn!

117
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,337
>> You guy, can you help me?

118
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,505
Grab another thing or do

119
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,590
something?

120
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,257
>> Courtney, chill out, dude!

121
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,134
Relax!

122
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,302
Don't yell at me like that!

123
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,345
>> I wasn't yelling.

124
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,179
I just wanted...

125
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,221
>> I know, but I didn't have

126
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:42,680
anything in my hands.

127
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:48,561
>> Relax. I'm sorry.

128
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,020
>> What is going to be

129
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,563
interesting now is the longer I

130
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,023
hang out, the longer I get to

131
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,483
see how they end up turning on

132
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,234
one another.

133
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,277
>> Ridiculous.

134
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,695
>> The one good thing that I had

135
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,488
going for me as far as the

136
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,324
Tribal Councils recently is I

137
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,492
didn't have to vote against my

138
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,077
tribe mates.

139
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,328
There wasn't any of that, where

140
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,788
these guys are going to have to

141
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,705
turn on one another.

142
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,165
And I hope I'm the fly on the

143
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:13,920
wall.

144
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,006
>> My stomach really hurts.

145
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,508
>> You guys both are, like...

146
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,926
that's horrible.

147
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,643
>> It's difficult just to stand.

148
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,686
We have to drink water.

149
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,687
>> I remember being so

150
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,854
constipated, I thought I was

151
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,855
having a...

152
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,190
>> A child?

153
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:34,774
>> No, I thought I was having

154
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,817
a...

155
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,192
>> Appendicitis?

156
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:36,776
>> That's it.

157
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,485
I thought I was having

158
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,486
appendicitis, it was that bad.

159
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,488
>> It's hard.

160
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,781
My stomach is so bloated it

161
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,493
hurts, and I haven't gone to the

162
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,998
bathroom since just before the

163
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,126
Panamanian village feast.

164
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,961
It's just-- I was blocked up and

165
00:04:55,044 --> 00:05:02,301
it's very, very, very painful.

166
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,595
>> Yeah, we all have boxes with

167
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,725
our names on them.

168
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,352
>> Oh, my God!

169
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,354
>> "A doll represents each of

170
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,355
you.

171
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,441
It needs a bit of your hair,

172
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,151
your clothes, your heart.

173
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:18,776
Give it some of your personality

174
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,528
and you're off to a good start.

175
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,363
How well you've observed your

176
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,322
surroundings could help

177
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,365
rejuvenate you for a while,

178
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,408
but if you've lived with

179
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,451
blinders on, you may find

180
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,786
yourself in Exile."

181
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,247
>> Oh.

182
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,502
>> It's so cute.

183
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,463
>> We got these dolls and we're

184
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,716
supposed to make them in our

185
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,717
likeness.

186
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,386
They're basically almost there.

187
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,097
>> How fun is that?

188
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,308
>> I'm trying to help my doll

189
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,435
out here in giving her just the

190
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,395
right amount of curves, so she

191
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,026
looks more like myself.

192
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,444
Shane, is that about right?

193
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,405
(Cirie laughing)

194
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,534
I actually like the blouse.

195
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,535
>> What do you think?

196
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,537
Does it look like me, Cirie?

197
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,538
>> Oh, my God, twins.

198
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,168
(Cirie laughing)

199
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,260
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

200
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,641
All right, for today's

201
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,476
challenge, we're going to see

202
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,311
how well you know the people

203
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:35,937
you've been living with for the

204
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,356
past 25 days.

205
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,607
I have a series of questions.

206
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,400
Each of you is going to fill out

207
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,069
these questions and answer these

208
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,904
questions in private.

209
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,364
I'll then tally the results;

210
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,406
we'll get to the challenge.

211
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,533
You can leave your voodoo dolls,

212
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,450
find a spot, fill them out, and

213
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,703
I'll tally them up.

214
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,629
Okay, I've tallied the results.

215
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,006
Now I'm going to ask you these

216
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,007
questions again.

217
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,591
This time when I ask you the

218
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,219
question, you're trying to guess

219
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,013
whose name came up most often.

220
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,056
It's not necessarily who you

221
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,932
voted for.

222
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,058
It's who you think everybody

223
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:14,475
else voted for.

224
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,727
There's a difference.

225
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,271
Each time you get one right, you

226
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,231
get to chop another tribe

227
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,399
member's rope.

228
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,692
Each time you chop a rope, you

229
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,693
release a torch.

230
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,528
After three chops, the voodoo

231
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,364
doll will go up in flames.

232
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:28,906
That person is out of the

233
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,241
challenge.

234
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:30,867
The last person left standing

235
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,701
wins reward.

236
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,703
I know you want to know what

237
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,120
you're playing for.

238
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:34,662
>> Yeah!

239
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,663
>> PROBST: The winner of today's

240
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,207
challenge will leave here via

241
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,667
helicopter to a very nice spa.

242
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,211
You'll get a shower, we'll wash

243
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,754
those clothes, get a mud

244
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,755
massage.

245
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,465
Then you will eat chicken, beef,

246
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,466
fish, pork chops.

247
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,467
>> Ah...

248
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,385
>> Man.

249
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,052
>> PROBST: You'll spend the

250
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,304
night, return to camp in the

251
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:51,804
morning.

252
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,555
Worth playing for?

253
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:52,763
>> Yeah.

254
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,598
>> PROBST: In addition, the

255
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,766
winner of today's challenge will

256
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,642
decide who is sent to Exile

257
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,938
Island.

258
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,981
All right, everybody has their

259
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,065
answer board.

260
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,775
First question-- it's going to

261
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,529
be fun-- who does the least for

262
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,573
the tribe?

263
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,616
Again, you're trying to guess

264
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,618
whose name came up most often

265
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,369
to the question "Who does the

266
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,163
least for the tribe?"

267
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,581
All right, reveal.

268
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,583
Courtney and Danielle say Bruce.

269
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,876
You're not right, take a step

270
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,418
back.

271
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,419
Bruce says Courtney.

272
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:24,754
You're not right.

273
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,047
Danielle is the correct answer.

274
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,672
Cirie, Aras, Terry, Shane all

275
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,674
got it right.

276
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,469
Take a step forward.

277
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,094
All right, Cirie, take the first

278
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:32,637
shot.

279
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,721
Who is she going to hit?

280
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,723
Cirie going to do the first

281
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,726
damage.

282
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,852
Terry takes his first hit.

283
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,853
(Terry scoffs)

284
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,562
Aras, you're up.

285
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:47,068
Aras heading straight to Terry.

286
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,819
Terry takes his second hit.

287
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,404
Terry now has two people to get

288
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,199
even with, only one hit.

289
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,575
With some gusto, he takes Aras

290
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,576
out.

291
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,577
This game's getting real

292
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,495
interesting.

293
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,704
Shane can put Terry out of this

294
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,040
or inflict some pain on someone

295
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,458
else.

296
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,126
Just like that, Terry is out of

297
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,836
the challenge, takes a seat on

298
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,089
the bench.

299
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:08,714
Can't be a big surprise for you,

300
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,384
coming into this challenge.

301
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,843
Terry not talking at all.

302
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,180
Next question: who never shuts

303
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,307
up?

304
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,600
Keep your answers to yourself.

305
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,602
Everybody reveal.

306
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,771
A lot of Terrys, one Bruce, but

307
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,815
the name you actually wrote down

308
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,359
the most: Courtney.

309
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,652
Cirie has it right, Shane has it

310
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:29,860
right.

311
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,945
>> Oh, wow.

312
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,863
>> PROBST: Take a step forward.

313
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,865
Shane, take your shot.

314
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,368
Going down to the end.

315
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:37,910
Bruce takes his first hit.

316
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,661
Cirie.

317
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,414
>> Sorry, Bruce.

318
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,415
>> It's okay.

319
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,457
>> PROBST: Cirie gives Bruce his

320
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,333
second hit.

321
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,419
Bruce now down to one rope left.

322
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,628
Next question: who mistakenly

323
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,548
believes they are running this

324
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,674
game?

325
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,427
This should be very interesting.

326
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,513
Reveal.

327
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,057
The correct answer: Shane.

328
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,434
Courtney has it right.

329
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,435
Aras has it right.

330
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,477
Shane, obvious question: news to

331
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,478
you?

332
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,022
>> I do not perceive to think

333
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,315
that I'm running the game.

334
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,566
>> PROBST: Aras, take your shot.

335
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,567
Clear pecking order being

336
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,568
established.

337
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,110
Bruce is out of the game.

338
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,404
Take a seat on the bench next to

339
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,489
Terry, Bruce.

340
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,825
Courtney, make your move.

341
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,285
>> I'll go for this one.

342
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:19,910
>> PROBST: Courtney gives Shane

343
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,829
his first hit.

344
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,705
That was a rough round for you,

345
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,706
Shane.

346
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,707
(Cirie snickering)

347
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,625
Next question: Who would you

348
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,461
trust with your life?

349
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,086
Remember, you're trying to guess

350
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,755
what the group thought as a

351
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:30,963
whole.

352
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,673
Everybody reveal.

353
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,884
Cirie says Bruce.

354
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,219
Cirie did not vote for herself.

355
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,220
That's too bad.

356
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,764
"Cirie" was the right answer.

357
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,806
Aras is the only one that got it

358
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,807
right.

359
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,975
How does that feel, Cirie?

360
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,560
>> Thanks, guys.

361
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,145
(giggling)

362
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,480
>> PROBST: Make your move, Aras.

363
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:47,897
Setting down.

364
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,649
Courtney takes her first hit.

365
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,734
Next question: Who would you

366
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,030
not trust to watch your back?

367
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,032
The correct answer is Terry.

368
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,325
Courtney has it right.

369
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,285
Aras has it right.

370
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:01,744
Courtney, you're up.

371
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,331
Danielle takes her first hit.

372
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,542
Aras.

373
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,794
Aras gives Cirie her first hit.

374
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,046
We are even up.

375
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,382
Everybody down to two ropes.

376
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,425
Who is the biggest poseur?

377
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,927
Somebody's feelings are about

378
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,928
to get hurt.

379
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,929
>> What is a poseur?

380
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,430
>> PROBST: Reveal.

381
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,683
The answer to "What is a

382
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,059
poseur?" is you.

383
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,936
"Courtney" was the right answer.

384
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,229
Aras is the only one who got it

385
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:28,437
right.

386
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,315
Aras, take your hit.

387
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,359
Danielle now down to her last

388
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:33,859
rope.

389
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,278
Next question: Who is the

390
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,780
moodiest?

391
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,949
The correct answer: Shane.

392
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,076
Courtney got it right, and

393
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,452
Aras, again, got it right.

394
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,662
Courtney, you're up.

395
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,913
Shane takes his second hit.

396
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,124
>> You're the only one that's

397
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:48,833
hit me twice.

398
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,834
Your life is changing.

399
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,793
>> PROBST: Except for the fact

400
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,377
you aren't really running the

401
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,420
game.

402
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,379
>> No, I'm talking about

403
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:53,629
Courtney.

404
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,171
You're in the wrong team.

405
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:54,922
>> Give me a break, dude.

406
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,840
We're playing a game.

407
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,759
>> A helicopter game with a spa

408
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,760
to boot.

409
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,803
>> Come on, Bruce, please.

410
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,846
>> Why would you hit me twice?

411
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,888
>> 'Cause I didn't know...

412
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,889
>> Guys, guys, let's rise above

413
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,182
it.

414
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,225
This game is meant to splinter

415
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:06,392
us.

416
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,977
Rise above it. Come on now.

417
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,894
>> Yeah, it's meant to splinter

418
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,521
you guys.

419
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,522
Come on.

420
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,567
>> PROBST: Aras, take your hit.

421
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,985
>> Danielle, I love you, but I

422
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,319
you know you can't get me back.

423
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,779
>> PROBST: Danielle is out.

424
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,864
Take a seat on the bench with

425
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,906
Bruce and Terry.

426
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,617
Cirie, Courtney, Aras, two ropes

427
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,618
left.

428
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,161
Shane down to his last rope.

429
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,997
Next question: Who most easily

430
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,375
succumbs to intimidation?

431
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,543
Courtney, at the last minute,

432
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,586
you changed yours.

433
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,503
What did you have before that?

434
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,171
>> Myself.

435
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:35,921
>> PROBST: You were right the

436
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:36,714
first time.

437
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,339
Courtney is the right answer.

438
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,216
Shane got it right.

439
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,009
>> Yeah, I wonder who he's going

440
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:40,801
to hit.

441
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,385
>> Who do you think I'm going

442
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,012
to hit?

443
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,263
>> PROBST: Shane and Courtney

444
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,556
down to their last ropes.

445
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,932
Cirie and Aras still with two.

446
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,018
Who is the most annoying person

447
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,394
out here?

448
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,562
(Cirie snickering)

449
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,564
Everybody says Courtney except

450
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:53,898
Courtney.

451
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,025
Obviously, you're surprised.

452
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,610
>> By being the right answer

453
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,527
for everything? Yeah.

454
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,320
(Cirie stifling giggles)

455
00:12:59,403 --> 00:12:59,904
It makes me feel great.

456
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,449
>> PROBST: Aras, you're up.

457
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,284
And with that, Courtney takes

458
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,660
her third hit.

459
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,578
>> Horrible.

460
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,454
>> PROBST: Courtney's out of the

461
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,455
game and probably happy to be

462
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,456
out of the game.

463
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,457
>> Well, I'm sure I'll be the

464
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,708
right answer to everything else

465
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,709
today.

466
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,002
>> PROBST: Shane heads to Aras.

467
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,879
>> Baby doll, please don't put

468
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,796
me out.

469
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,923
Me owe you one.

470
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,174
>> PROBST: Shane playing

471
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,050
strategically.

472
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,676
Aras down to one rope left.

473
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,386
Shane down to one rope left.

474
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,639
Cirie, who are you going to put

475
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,056
out of this game?

476
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,474
(Cirie groans)

477
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,016
Come make your hit.

478
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,144
>> Shane, I'm sorry.

479
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,145
>> Why d... Why?

480
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,648
>> Because I promised Aras I

481
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,649
wouldn't hit him.

482
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,316
>> You did?

483
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:37,733
>> Yeah.

484
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,818
>> That tells me a lot, too.

485
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,947
>> Sorry, Shane.

486
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,948
>> PROBST: Cirie knocks Shane

487
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,908
out of the game.

488
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,909
>> Shane takes a seat on the

489
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,076
bench.

490
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,952
>> Cirie just like under the

491
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,329
radar, gets her thing.

492
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,789
>> Shane, come on, it's a game.

493
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,665
>> Don't be such a hard...

494
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,541
>> It's all good.

495
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,416
I'm just having an emotional

496
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:54,708
reaction.

497
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,668
>> Okay, it's all right.

498
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,252
>> It's all good.

499
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,086
I want to go on a jet and fly

500
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,254
and eat a sandwich.

501
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,088
It's all good.

502
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,257
>> PROBST: Here's where we

503
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,633
stand: Cirie has two ropes

504
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,968
left; Aras, you have one.

505
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,386
That means if Cirie gets this

506
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,471
right, regardless what you do,

507
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:07,888
it's over.

508
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,889
>> It's over. Right.

509
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,433
Next question: Who would never

510
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,811
survive on their own?

511
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,693
>> What do I do?

512
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,694
What do I do?

513
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,903
>> PROBST: Cirie not sure what

514
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,904
to do.

515
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,114
Takes a long time to make her

516
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,283
decision.

517
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,033
Did she get it right?

518
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,034
Reveal.

519
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,328
Aras says Terry.

520
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:31,996
Cirie says herself.

521
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,165
The correct answer is Cirie.

522
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,584
Cirie got it right.

523
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,126
Cirie wins this challenge.

524
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,295
Make your last hit.

525
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,838
(applauding and cheering)

526
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,880
>> Did you do that on purpose,

527
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,881
Aras?

528
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,924
>> Me? I don't think you could

529
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,551
survive a day in the wilderness.

530
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,094
>> Sorry, Aras.

531
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,721
>> PROBST: And with that, Cirie

532
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,055
wins her first challenge.

533
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,432
>> Yay!

534
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,392
>> Good job, Cirie.

535
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,810
(Cirie exhales sharply)

536
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:55,894
>> PROBST: Nicely done.

537
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,895
>> Thank you, thank you.

538
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:57,896
>> PROBST: All right, first

539
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,064
decision you have to make: Who

540
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,191
are you sending to Exile Island?

541
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,110
>> Oh, I can't send... 'cause

542
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,528
I... Terry, sorry.

543
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,904
>> PROBST: Terry, for a third

544
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,156
time, going back to Exile

545
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:07,364
Island.

546
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:07,990
Did you expect that?

547
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:08,991
>> I've come to expect all bad

548
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,201
things for right now, Jeff,

549
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,077
until, uh, something changes.

550
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,330
>> Sorry.

551
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,080
>> PROBST: Head on out, Terry.

552
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,167
The boat will pick you up.

553
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,960
All right, Cirie, so, helicopter

554
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,921
ride, spa, massage, clean

555
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,340
clothes, take a shower, a lot of

556
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,507
food.

557
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,508
You're bringing two people with

558
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,176
you...

559
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:27,968
(Cirie sighs)

560
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:28,927
>> PROBST: ...which means you

561
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,763
are leaving three people behind.

562
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,722
>> Oh...

563
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,890
>> PROBST: You've already sent

564
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,183
one person to Exile.

565
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,935
Who's the first person?

566
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,395
Shane is on his knees begging.

567
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,730
>> Oh, Cirie!

568
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,732
>> I promised Aras since day

569
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,358
one.

570
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,359
I'm sorry!

571
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,569
>> PROBST: Aras, head over.

572
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,028
>> I promised.

573
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:51,784
I gotta keep a promise.

574
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,118
Oh...

575
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,119
>> PROBST: One more person going

576
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,245
with you.

577
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,330
The other three going back to

578
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,873
Gitanos camp.

579
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,416
>> First.

580
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,043
>> We talked about this, Cirie.

581
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,044
We already talked about this.

582
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:02,961
>> She promised.

583
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,545
>> We did, Shane, but it was

584
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,963
after Danielle.

585
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,964
>> PROBST: Danielle is your

586
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:06,423
choice?

587
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,132
>> I'm sorry. Yes.

588
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,261
Sorry, Shane, I'm sorry.

589
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,972
>> You are sorry.

590
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,973
Devastating.

591
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,058
>> Aras promised me since day

592
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,101
one, day one, if he ever won, he

593
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,102
would take me.

594
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,062
>> I'm not worried about Aras.

595
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,063
>> So, I mean...

596
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,064
>> I'm worried about the

597
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,065
Danielle call.

598
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,066
I think that you made the wrong

599
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:24,692
call.

600
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,359
>> Okay.

601
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,360
>> Thanks.

602
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,986
>> Have fun.

603
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,987
>> PROBST: All right, guys,

604
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,572
helicopter waiting for you down

605
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,658
on the beach.

606
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,252
Bruce, Courtney, Shane, rough

607
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,211
afternoon.

608
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,213
I got nothing to make it any

609
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,047
better.

610
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:47,673
Get your stuff, head on back to

611
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,299
camp.

612
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,520
>> This is amazing!

613
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,521
>> We're doing it!

614
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,105
We're in a helicopter!

615
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,106
>> Oh, yeah.

616
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,191
(laughter)

617
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,077
>> Look at this.

618
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,245
>> Oh... my... God!

619
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,246
>> Ha-ha.

620
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,247
>> This is going to be the best

621
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,248
night of my life.

622
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,249
>> Oh, my God

623
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,250
Honestly, I'm so happy.

624
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,252
>> I'm not kidding.

625
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,253
>> I have never been in a

626
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,172
helicopter before.

627
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,715
It's almost like I was alone

628
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,468
flying above this place,

629
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,428
getting to see all of this

630
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,013
stuff that I would never in a

631
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,848
lifetime... on my own be able to

632
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:42,144
see.

633
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,605
Oh... my... God!

634
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,148
I picked Aras and Danielle

635
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,941
because they were the people

636
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,693
that I thought I would have the

637
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,903
most fun with.

638
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,237
But this could potentially be,

639
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,031
like, a fatal move for me.

640
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:54,615
I'm probably public enemy #1

641
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,575
now because I didn't take the

642
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,411
people who are back at camp.

643
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,120
>> What is on this plate?!

644
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,373
God, I'm so happy!

645
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,374
(Cirie chuckling)

646
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,626
I'm going to lean back.

647
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,294
You guys, relax, relax.

648
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,670
There's so much food.

649
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,798
>> Mmm...

650
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,466
>> I had fun at that challenge.

651
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,258
I laughed so much.

652
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,761
>> I did, too, but it wasn't

653
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,678
fun in the end.

654
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,180
Man, they put Courtney as the

655
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,181
most annoying.

656
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,182
Wow.

657
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,183
>> She got that, too?

658
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,184
>> Mm-hmm.

659
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,185
>> She and Cirie did.

660
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,812
She cleaned up today.

661
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,188
>> You should have seen her

662
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:26,396
face.

663
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,356
>> That's why I couldn't stop

664
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,108
laughing 'cause it was so funny.

665
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,026
I mean, I would be kind of

666
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,236
pissed if my tribe members

667
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,488
thought that I was the most

668
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,031
annoying.

669
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,325
(stifled laughter)

670
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,202
Oh, my gosh.

671
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:47,084
I would have felt the same way.

672
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,919
>> I've always thought that me,

673
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,963
Aras, and Cirie were tight in a

674
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,798
three-way thing, and today, I

675
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,966
don't know.

676
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:54,508
Like, I got to ask myself

677
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,718
where Cirie is with Danielle.

678
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,761
And so, I was pretty shocked

679
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,762
that she didn't pick me today,

680
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,764
for sure.

681
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,392
>> Well, that was fun.

682
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,813
You get to know where you stand.

683
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,397
>> I had no idea Danielle and

684
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,525
Cirie were that close.

685
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,986
>> I don't care about that.

686
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,071
I care about the game.

687
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,031
And what you said about me.

688
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,034
>> You do?

689
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,286
>> Are you kidding?

690
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,413
Can you just think for a second

691
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,623
how that would make you feel?

692
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,332
I'm sure you didn't pay

693
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,085
attention to how many answers I

694
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,086
was the answer to, but...

695
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,087
>> I think you're also

696
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,172
personalizing a lot of it.

697
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,424
>> How can I not be...

698
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,425
opinion about me?

699
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,426
>> No, but some of the questions

700
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,552
were stupid.

701
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,596
Who is the most annoying?

702
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,055
That one might not be fun,

703
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,098
but...

704
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,808
>> It's hurtful.

705
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,768
I just got, like, I was so

706
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,895
happy to be here, like,

707
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,562
yesterday.

708
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,689
Now I'm, like...

709
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,985
I don't want to be here.

710
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:55,986
I'm going to have to live with

711
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,404
this for the rest of my life.

712
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,197
>> Courtney destroyed herself

713
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,991
today.

714
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,034
I mean, she takes a lot of stuff

715
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,202
personally, anyway, and just to

716
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,370
hear the, like, some of the

717
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,623
answers to what the tribe thinks

718
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,958
about her is just, I think

719
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,293
really got her in an all-time

720
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,377
low.

721
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,881
(coughing)

722
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,007
You know, the common voice of

723
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,258
the tribe was heard today, you

724
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,468
know?

725
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,053
She got a lot of bombs dropped

726
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,221
on her today, so it's gonna be

727
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:22,846
very interesting to see how she

728
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,264
handles herself for the next few

729
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,851
days.

730
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:52,793
>> Yeah, Bud?

731
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,878
>> Bruce has been in pain for

732
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,420
the last few days, and it

733
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,464
started to really sort of double

734
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,633
and triple up, I think.

735
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,259
>> I've had so many weird

736
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:01,510
injuries.

737
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,971
Tons of horrible injuries and

738
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,348
injuries.

739
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,558
This is one of the most painful.

740
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,519
But... it's part of the game.

741
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,187
>> His stomach has been

742
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,063
bothering him for the last ten

743
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,022
to 12 days, and it's been a

744
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,357
matter of him not being able,

745
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,817
really, to go to the bathroom.

746
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,193
And at times, Bruce can tend to

747
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,236
be overdramatic, but there was

748
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,487
nothing overdramatic about what

749
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,863
was happening.

750
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,032
He was in a lot of pain.

751
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:29,538
(groans)

752
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,081
>> My whole back, all my

753
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,374
stomach, everything, my whole

754
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,876
inter... hurts so bad every

755
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,045
second.

756
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,005
And this, the pain is just

757
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,423
increasing.

758
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,968
So painful.

759
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,469
>> Yo, you got to get better

760
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,596
'cause we need you.

761
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,557
(groaning)

762
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,226
>> I'm just concerned 'cause

763
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,979
it's escalating so fast.

764
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,860
(groans)

765
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,572
(Cirie moans)

766
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,531
>> Ooh!

767
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,450
Thank you, God, for letting

768
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,785
me get this one.

769
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,245
If I don't win anything else,

770
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:14,499
thank you, God. Whoo!

771
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,293
We got a mud massage.

772
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,753
That is wonderful.

773
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,462
It was like "Lifetimes of the

774
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,380
Rich & Famous."

775
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,050
I felt like Robin Leach.

776
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,176
Well, Danielle, is this

777
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:24,843
something for your first

778
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,136
massage?

779
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,221
>> Oh, good.

780
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,347
The man that gave me a massage

781
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,183
was pretty rough 'cause I've

782
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,768
never had a professional massage

783
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,352
done, but I usually like to be

784
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,313
massaged a little bit easier.

785
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,522
Aah!

786
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,608
>> Danielle picked the guy.

787
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,525
>> Oh, boy.

788
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,568
>> She figured he'd have

789
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,321
stronger hands, and he did.

790
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,532
>> Holy snakies.

791
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,542
>> Wow. Oh, my gosh.

792
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,503
>> Do I have another stomach?

793
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,590
(laughter)

794
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,675
That's it.

795
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,555
Maybe one more bite.

796
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,641
>> Today is almost like I'm

797
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,726
starting over.

798
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,727
If I'm out of the game because

799
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,479
of this, at least I got to do

800
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,856
this before I went because

801
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,525
this is great.

802
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,859
>> I think that game officially

803
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,653
pointed out the immaturity of

804
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,780
our group.

805
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,156
Courtney, her and Shane, man,

806
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,533
they are so similar.

807
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,534
>> They are.

808
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,952
>> She has a serious crush on

809
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:32,536
him, I think.

810
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,330
>> A total crush on him.

811
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,456
>> And the thing is with

812
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,916
Courtney, is she just wants to

813
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,417
be wanted.

814
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,919
Like, that's her psychological

815
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,129
pattern, and so she loves it

816
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,131
when Shane engages her in those

817
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:44,673
arguments about her being

818
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,633
passive-aggressive.

819
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,217
Even though she'll, like, walk

820
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,801
away and be angry, she knows

821
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,510
that there's going to be a

822
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,637
makeup point.

823
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,763
>> I can imagine the arguments

824
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,806
they're going to have tonight--

825
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,141
Courtney and Shane.

826
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,225
You know they've been arguing

827
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:55,684
since they got back.

828
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,435
>> Poor Bruce, he's right there

829
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,478
smack-dab in the middle.

830
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:58,895
>> And he's hurting.

831
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,479
>> Poor Bruce.

832
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,522
>> I'm going to be so not liked

833
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,816
tomorrow.

834
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,483
>> I like you.

835
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,694
>> I love you.

836
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,446
(laughter)

837
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,996
(Bruce groaning)

838
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,428
(groaning)

839
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,897
>> Uh-oh.

840
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,149
>> It's been doubling and

841
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,026
escalating so fast since I got

842
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,236
back.

843
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,321
(groans)

844
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,530
>> Can I sing you a song.

845
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,658
Will that help?

846
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,285
>> No.

847
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,663
It's going to be okay.

848
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:11,551
♪ Just take me away... ♪

849
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,011
>> Bruce had really horrible

850
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,471
stomach pains.

851
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,931
He's had pains for about four

852
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,099
days now, and it just got

853
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,894
really unbearable for him.

854
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,355
And I went in there, was trying

855
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,481
to calm him down 'cause he

856
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,523
was just like, literally like

857
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,566
writhing and convulsing in

858
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,237
pain, and he was just begging

859
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,279
for the medics to get here, so

860
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,283
the medic had to be called.

861
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,576
>> I don't want to quit.

862
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,911
>> Huh?

863
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,079
>> I don't want to quit.

864
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:39,788
I just want to get well.

865
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:45,627
(groans)

866
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,838
(motor rumbling)

867
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,385
>> Aw...

868
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:01,726
>> Bruce?

869
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,645
(Bruce groans)

870
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:03,812
>> Hi.

871
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,688
>> Hi. How you doing?

872
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,439
>> It gets worse; it just

873
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,316
escalates so bad.

874
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,150
(groans)

875
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,819
>> Talk to me.

876
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,654
Whereabouts is the pain?

877
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,364
>> All over my back and stomach

878
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,199
but... (groans)

879
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,534
It's just getting worse.

880
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,119
>> Bruce, are you allergic to

881
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,288
anything?

882
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:30,714
>> No, injuries-- tons of them.

883
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,800
(Bruce groans)

884
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,552
>> Brain has been hurting for

885
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,471
hours.

886
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,682
Oh, God...

887
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,808
Oh, God, it hurts so much.

888
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,603
>> All right, lift your head up

889
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,022
for a minute.

890
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:47,814
Just going to unbutton your

891
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,817
shirt here.

892
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,571
>> It's not fair.

893
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:54,904
(Bruce yells)

894
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,573
>> Okay...

895
00:26:56,656 --> 00:27:04,998
>> Don't, don't, don't.

896
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:05,790
>> (groaning): All right.

897
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,210
Aah, I've been in pain so long.

898
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,256
(panting)

899
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:13,923
Don't miss.

900
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,805
(groaning)

901
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,934
>> I can't touch...

902
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:29,272
Oh, give me some relief, please.

903
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,482
>> What I want you to do is hold

904
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,858
this to your mouth and breathe

905
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,984
in and out, just nice smooth

906
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:33,818
breaths.

907
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,653
(coughs, groans)

908
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,489
>> That's it.

909
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,782
>> My stomach hurts so much--

910
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,493
it's increasing.

911
00:27:41,576 --> 00:28:09,979
>> Ow, ow...

912
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,772
>> I'm going to need you guys to

913
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,232
help me carry the stretcher.

914
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,274
I'm just going to go out to the

915
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,484
boat and head back to base camp

916
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,486
and I'll reassess him there.

917
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,404
I think we've got his pain under

918
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,321
control, and all his vital

919
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,447
signs...

920
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,115
>> Okay. Did you give him a

921
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,243
shot?

922
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,786
>> Uh, do we need to do this

923
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,246
right this second?

924
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,456
>> Yes, we do.

925
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,088
>> Bruce, what I'm gonna get you

926
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,591
to do...

927
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,012
You move towards me.

928
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:43,888
I'm not gonna move you.

929
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,182
Here, I'll give you help.

930
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:46,808
Lift that foot up.

931
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,561
There you go.

932
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,938
...so you roll back down.

933
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,273
(Bruce groans)

934
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,441
>> Just... on your side a bit

935
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,817
there.

936
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,485
Just nice and slow.

937
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,279
Do you want to use my hand?

938
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,238
>> Ow...

939
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,614
>> It's going to be all right,

940
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,907
Bruce.

941
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,910
(groans)

942
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,787
>> I'm going to pull it.

943
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,997
Everyone's going to follow him

944
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,081
all the way.

945
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:10,999
Lift up, nice and gently, that's

946
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,127
it.

947
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,636
>> Bruce, we'll see you really

948
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,054
soon.

949
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,223
>> Steady, and stop there.

950
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:31,102
(indistinct orders)

951
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,941
>> Love you, Bruce.

952
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,568
>> See you in a minute, Brucey.

953
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,986
(Bruce groaning)

954
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,658
(boat engine rumbles)

955
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,034
>> Back...

956
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,661
I would hope Bruce would

957
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,079
come back and finish on his own

958
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,456
terms, absolutely.

959
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,832
I don't want to have anybody,

960
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,875
just-- you know what I mean, be

961
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,043
pulled from the game because of

962
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:55,877
medical reasons.

963
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,503
I wouldn't feel right about it

964
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:56,836
at all.

965
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,837
But I think that he definitely

966
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,006
would feel like, um, he didn't

967
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,090
get to finish under his terms,

968
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,258
and I know that would be a hard

969
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,760
thing for Bruce, because Bruce

970
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,386
has lived a really beautiful,

971
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,639
whole, big, gi-normous life,

972
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,265
so...

973
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,601
No, I wish... I really hope

974
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:27,534
Bruce gets to come back.

975
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,743
>> Casaya totally has it out for

976
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:28,910
me.

977
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,787
There's been a target on my back

978
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,580
since the merge, so the

979
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,415
participation part of the reward

980
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,834
challenge was a joke, a waste of

981
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:37,877
time for me, but the good part

982
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,296
about it was the observation

983
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,798
time where I got to watch the

984
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,132
Casaya members go at it against

985
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,092
one another.

986
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,176
You know, yesterday wasn't a

987
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,886
total loss, and being sent here

988
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,429
to Exile Island gives me a

989
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,430
little bit more time to think

990
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,431
about strategy for the upcoming

991
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,518
two weeks.

992
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,190
>> Poor Brucey.

993
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,276
I wonder how he is today.

994
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,611
Yesterday was an extremely

995
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,655
emotional, draining day for me.

996
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,700
Ending the day with Bruce being

997
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,660
taken away was like the icing

998
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,869
and the cherry and the hot

999
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,621
fudge on top of my, uh, pretty

1000
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,331
poo-poo day.

1001
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,791
>> Let me ask you a question.

1002
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:17,417
If I need your vote in order to

1003
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,753
get us one person further, would

1004
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,422
you trust me and not break my

1005
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,506
back?

1006
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,465
I can't have the

1007
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,092
obsessive-compulsive, like, you

1008
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,094
overthinking part.

1009
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,137
>> It's-It's hard for me to say,

1010
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,013
yes, I'll just agree with

1011
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,014
everything that you think.

1012
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:31,931
You know, obviously, it's hard

1013
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,100
to say.

1014
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,101
But, you know, I want to be on

1015
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,102
your backside, and I would like

1016
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:36,978
you to be on mine.

1017
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,062
>> Okay.

1018
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,355
>> So, we're on the same page of

1019
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,732
what we want.

1020
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,691
>> All right, grab that little

1021
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,275
log right there, that skinny

1022
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,026
one.

1023
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,111
>> We just keep everything

1024
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,029
between us.

1025
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:46,446
>> If we don't...

1026
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,822
>> Don't.

1027
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:48,823
>> ...I'll kill you when I get

1028
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:49,741
back to Hollywood.

1029
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,617
>> (laughs): No. Great.

1030
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,576
>> I will.

1031
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,493
I'll drive up, and I'll kill you

1032
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,494
in your ... little apartment.

1033
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,120
Then I'll drive over to my club,

1034
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,956
and that'll be it.

1035
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,042
>> That was really nice.

1036
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,209
I don't have a ... apartment.

1037
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,461
>> (shouting): Well, obviously,

1038
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,462
dude, I don't...

1039
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,463
I've never been in your

1040
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,505
apartment!

1041
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,798
I don't know if it's ... or not!

1042
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,799
It was an adjective!

1043
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,050
>> I know.

1044
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,926
>> Don't take everything so

1045
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,011
personal!

1046
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,138
>> You're just so obnoxious.

1047
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:12,513
You're not funny.

1048
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,390
>> No, I'm not obnoxious, man.

1049
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,308
Think about it.

1050
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,184
>> Wait, you're not...

1051
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,143
>> Why are you so...

1052
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:17,518
>> You're not...

1053
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,103
>> ...sensitive?

1054
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,481
Glenn Close, Sybil, bunny

1055
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,650
boiler,<i> Fatal Attraction--</i>

1056
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,985
she's so scary, man.

1057
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,404
She's a lunatic, man, and

1058
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,656
especially after yesterday, and

1059
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,198
finding out that the entire

1060
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,116
tribe thinks she's an idiot.

1061
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,744
I mean, she is a dream to take

1062
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,162
to the final two.

1063
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,163
Anyone could win against her.

1064
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,164
Anyone.

1065
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,165
It's crazy.

1066
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,251
She's a dream.

1067
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,482
>> Danielle, Aras, and I-- we

1068
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,359
get home from the reward, and,

1069
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:10,405
uh, no one's there to greet us.

1070
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,656
Oh, my God.

1071
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,281
The tension at the camp when we

1072
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,492
got back was so thick, I was

1073
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,869
afraid to-to come past the palm

1074
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,371
frond trees, because I didn't

1075
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,914
know if, you know...

1076
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:21,207
Was it safe?

1077
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,542
>> Is that Court?

1078
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,459
>> Welcome home.

1079
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,377
We lost a member.

1080
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,253
>> Shut up!

1081
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:25,503
>> Bruce.

1082
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,046
>> Oh, my God!

1083
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,131
>> Bruce went home?

1084
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,132
>> Yeah.

1085
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,425
He was med-evac'd out of here.

1086
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,426
>> So he's done?

1087
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,427
>> Shut up.

1088
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,761
>> I don't know.

1089
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,846
Well, last night was just,

1090
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,930
like...

1091
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,140
He was super sick, then we

1092
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,976
called medical, and then the

1093
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,477
boat came and took him up, and I

1094
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,020
have no idea if he's in the

1095
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:43,438
game, if he's okay.

1096
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,188
I don't know anything.

1097
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,107
>> Wow!

1098
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,775
>> But you guys had a great

1099
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,234
time, I'm sure.

1100
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,778
>> We get back to the beach,

1101
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,946
and Bruce Factor has been

1102
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,157
med-evac'd out of here.

1103
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,908
Courtney, who was really

1104
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,326
affected by the last challenge.

1105
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,662
And finally I see Shane, and

1106
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,373
Shane, honestly, was an animal.

1107
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,875
>> I caught a boa constrictor.

1108
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,626
>> He just looked like he hadn't

1109
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,004
eaten food, had water, or seen

1110
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,006
people in days.

1111
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,007
>> You all right, man?

1112
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,008
>> Yeah, no, I'm good.

1113
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,009
>> What's going on?

1114
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,094
>> Nothing.

1115
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,232
>> Damn!

1116
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,076
>> We're not good.

1117
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,951
I don't trust her.

1118
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:39,786
>> Shane, Shane...

1119
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,536
>> She's got to come to me.

1120
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,245
>> She will.

1121
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:41,829
She'll talk to you about it.

1122
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,413
>> I am disappointed in her in

1123
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,499
a big way, and I am not going

1124
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,334
out before Danielle, dude.

1125
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,376
That bitch did nothing for 30

1126
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,503
days.

1127
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,962
Gets to go up yesterday.

1128
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,339
She's done nothing but be lazy

1129
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,173
and wait to get fed, and Cirie

1130
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,801
takes her?

1131
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,760
That is not right.

1132
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,385
I have put Cirie on my back, all

1133
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,136
300 pounds of her.

1134
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,346
Have put her on my back.

1135
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,225
You and I both have.

1136
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,142
It was wrong yesterday.

1137
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:07,021
It was wrong.

1138
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:07,980
>> Didn't you play sports?

1139
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:08,981
Didn't you have teams?

1140
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:09,982
Like, you lose some, you win

1141
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:10,983
some.

1142
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,069
Get over it.

1143
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:17,990
>> Listen, I'm not worried about

1144
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:18,991
anybody but me now.

1145
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,076
>> I know you're not.

1146
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:20,952
>> And guess what?

1147
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:21,744
Everyone is in big trouble

1148
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,745
'cause I'm going to do whatever

1149
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,704
it takes.

1150
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,705
If you and Cirie don't make me

1151
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,623
absolutely believe that it's

1152
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,415
still the three of us...

1153
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,375
>> Mm.

1154
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:27,917
>> ...I'm turning the whole

1155
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,334
game.

1156
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,335
I mean, look at me, look at me.

1157
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,336
I'm in the game now.

1158
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,170
I'm in the game.

1159
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,338
>> I know, and...

1160
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,257
>> And everyone's in a big, big

1161
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,800
problem.

1162
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,468
>> I tried not to get into it

1163
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,011
with Shane.

1164
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,555
All of it was basically his

1165
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,973
insecurity about where he

1166
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,932
stands.

1167
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,100
In my thinking, the last thing I

1168
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,351
need is Shane on the loose

1169
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,270
really changing this game up,

1170
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,397
so just let him say his piece.

1171
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,274
We'll get him down.

1172
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,275
We'll calm him down.

1173
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,401
We'll gain back his trust, and

1174
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,111
hopefully, Cirie will peace it

1175
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,821
with him, and we'll be all good.

1176
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,072
>> First, as far as the game

1177
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,324
part is concerned, I've never,

1178
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,325
ever wavered about me, you and

1179
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,326
Aras.

1180
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,327
Did you see me there?

1181
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,328
Did you see me?

1182
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,080
"Oh, okay, it's just you and

1183
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:07,123
you."

1184
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:07,748
It was so hard because I know

1185
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,792
how you felt.

1186
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,127
Did you not think it was hard

1187
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,378
for me to not take you after

1188
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,963
everything?

1189
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:14,922
>> Yeah, but, I... yeah.

1190
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,882
I didn't...

1191
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,424
I didn't know that it was...

1192
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,217
I had no idea that you and

1193
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,343
Danielle had the type of...

1194
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,386
Like, I watched it, but I was

1195
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,304
just, like...

1196
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:21,846
>> That's what I'm saying.

1197
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,556
It's not like a type of thing

1198
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,724
like we have.

1199
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,018
Nothing like that at all.

1200
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,728
Shane is so hurt because he

1201
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,395
feels like he deserved the

1202
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,647
reward way more than Danielle.

1203
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,857
He just thought it would be a

1204
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,900
no-brainer.

1205
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,484
If I won, me, him and Aras would

1206
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,570
go.

1207
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,784
>> Uh-uh.

1208
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,830
>> All right.

1209
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:56,881
>> Yes?

1210
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,257
>> Mm-hmm.

1211
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,383
>> Me, Cirie and Aras are in an

1212
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,260
alliance, officially, and will

1213
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,304
be until we get to the four.

1214
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,682
The whole discussion was a big

1215
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,392
rant and was absolutely

1216
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,020
calculated by me in order to get

1217
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,357
ahead of Cirie and Aras

1218
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,567
mentally, and it played exactly

1219
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,485
the way I wanted it to.

1220
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,445
I think, subconsciously, I

1221
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,864
control that-that threesome for

1222
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:25,326
sure.

1223
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,259
>> I'm just cleaning, um,

1224
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,552
Bruce's Zen garden, and I wanted

1225
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,763
to write the words, like, "Love,

1226
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,515
Bruce," just to send him love

1227
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,600
right now, 'cause no matter

1228
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,935
where he is right now, he's-he's

1229
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,353
having a hard time.

1230
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,980
I was going to put l-u-v, "luv

1231
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,272
you," on this side.

1232
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,442
>> That would be great.

1233
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,694
>> Bruce was just go, go, go,

1234
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,070
go, go.

1235
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,030
That was his mentality, and I

1236
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,490
gave him a lot of credit.

1237
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,491
I mean, I looked at him as like

1238
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,492
a father figure.

1239
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,493
I mean, I really connected with

1240
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,494
him.

1241
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,453
You know, I said my prayers for

1242
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,330
him last night.

1243
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,456
I just really hope that Bruce is

1244
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,791
okay.

1245
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,710
Um, you know, it was...

1246
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,961
I had, like, an eerie feeling

1247
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,045
last night that he wasn't even

1248
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,046
in the shelter, and I just pray

1249
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,047
to God that everything's fine

1250
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,507
and he's healthy.

1251
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,592
>> He would love it.

1252
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,679
He would love it.

1253
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,139
>> I don't even care about the

1254
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,265
game aspect of it.

1255
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,474
I just want to make sure he's

1256
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,435
okay.

1257
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:37,315
So I hope we find out soon!

1258
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,401
>> Here comes a boat.

1259
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,447
>> Terry has a red shirt with

1260
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,489
blue sleeves, right?

1261
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,532
>> Yeah.

1262
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,659
>> It's still three, whoever it

1263
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,120
is, man.

1264
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:53,956
>> Is that Terry?

1265
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,790
>> Yeah, that's Terry.

1266
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,624
>> It's Jeff.

1267
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,542
>> Isn't that Probst?

1268
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,376
>> Shut up!

1269
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:57,710
>> And Probst?

1270
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,004
>> Yeah, and Probst is with him.

1271
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,005
>> Jeff and Terry.

1272
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,006
Wow.

1273
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,007
I need to go find out what this

1274
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,092
is about.

1275
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,178
>> PROBST: What's going on,

1276
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:07,970
Aras?

1277
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,346
>> A lot, apparently.

1278
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,722
>> It is Terry.

1279
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,099
Damn.

1280
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,017
>> Well...

1281
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,101
>> Yeah.

1282
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:14,935
>> PROBST: How you doing?

1283
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,103
>> Good to see you, sir.

1284
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,021
>> PROBST: Nice to see you.

1285
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:17,438
(indistinct chatter)

1286
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,231
Hello.

1287
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,066
>> Hello.

1288
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,025
>> Hi.

1289
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,736
>> PROBST: Where's Courtney?

1290
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,695
You heard about Bruce?

1291
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,073
>> I haven't heard anything.

1292
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:27,865
>> PROBST: I'll give you the

1293
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:28,574
whole low-down.

1294
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,533
>> I haven't heard anything.

1295
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,117
>> PROBST: Let's do it up at

1296
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,703
camp.

1297
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,749
>> PROBST: Wouldn't have a...

1298
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:37,708
I don't know if you guys got

1299
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,501
seats or anywhere you can plop

1300
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:43,172
it.

1301
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,590
Okay, I know everybody wants an

1302
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,716
update.

1303
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,301
I have an update.

1304
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,677
First, we got to catch Terry up.

1305
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,637
I think everybody was pretty

1306
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,554
clear that when we went to the

1307
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,098
last reward challenge, Bruce

1308
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,099
wasn't feeling very well.

1309
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:53,682
Had a lot of stomach pain, was

1310
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,935
having trouble walking.

1311
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,937
Reward challenge ends, pain

1312
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,522
continues.

1313
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,398
Bruce asks for medical to come

1314
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:01,816
in and check him.

1315
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:02,525
Medical checks him out, runs

1316
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,443
some tests, says you need to go

1317
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,736
to a hospital.

1318
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,737
And it is a good thing that he

1319
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,696
got there when he did.

1320
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,864
They ran some tests and found

1321
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:09,573
out that his entire digestive

1322
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,201
system-- his colon and his

1323
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,078
bladder-- were blocked.

1324
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,246
Nothing was coming out.

1325
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,539
And I know everybody's concerned

1326
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,624
about Bruce's well-being.

1327
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,458
He's going to be okay, but he

1328
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,587
will not return to the game as

1329
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,630
a player.

1330
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,631
Bruce is no longer in the

1331
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:30,636
running for a million dollars.

1332
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,893
It is now down to you six.

1333
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,311
There will be no immunity

1334
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:39,687
challenge today.

1335
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,648
Nobody will be voted out tonight

1336
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,191
at Tribal Council.

1337
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,693
We're hoping that Bruce will be

1338
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,361
back for the next Tribal Council

1339
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,904
and continue on as a member of

1340
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,865
the jury, but we're waiting for

1341
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,700
approval from the doctors.

1342
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,827
So, that's the update.

1343
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,996
You have the afternoon off, and

1344
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:57,872
the game continues on.

1345
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,706
Make sense?

1346
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,707
>> Sure. Thanks for coming.

1347
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,624
>> PROBST: Sorry it was bad

1348
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,667
news.

1349
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,668
>> Thanks, Jeff.

1350
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,754
>> PROBST: Later, guys.

1351
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,019
>> Bruce is the master sensei.

1352
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,437
You know, he'll be back.

1353
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:21,812
He's a fighter.

1354
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,814
I-I don't think any one of us

1355
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,191
could have put up with the pain

1356
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,984
that he put up with in the hopes

1357
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,237
of, uh, staying in the game, and

1358
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,280
to see him go this way is a

1359
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,281
shame, 'cause he's a warrior, a

1360
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,282
total warrior.

1361
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,325
57-year-old master sensei in the

1362
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:41,415
true sense.

1370

>> Look for the address?

1371
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:55,429
>> Shane found a piece of wood

1372
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:56,430
and is calling it his

1373
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:57,598
Blackberry.

1374
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,599
>> Send.

1375
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,850
I'm communicating with people,

1376
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,810
not on this island.

1377
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,853
(cuckoo clock chimes)

1378
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,562

1379
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:03,979
you're playing for?

1380
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,397
The survivors are in for a

1381
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,273
surprise.

1382
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,358
>> Yeah! Yeah!

1383
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,359

1384
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,068

1385
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,153
monster!
