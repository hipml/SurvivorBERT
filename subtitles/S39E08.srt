1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,552
>> Jeff: TONIGHT IT'S
BACK-TO-BACK EPISODES OF

2
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,302
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,097
>> CAN I TRUST HER?

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:25,400
>> I'M LIKE REALLY DISGUSTED.

5
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,776
>> WELL PLAYED.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,653
>> DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONAL.

7
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,238
THERE I WAS TRYING TO SAVE MY
OWN ASS.

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:34,242
AFTER TRIBAL I HAD THE PLAY THE
CARD LIKE I SAVED MYSELF, NO

9
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:38,288
HARD FEELINGS, IT'S A GAME, BUT
EVERYONE WAS ABSOLUTELY IN

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,789
SHOCK.

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,459
THE GODMOTHER WAS UPSET HER SON
WENT HOME.

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,128
JAMAL WAS UPSET HE WASTED HIS
IDOL.

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,466
BUT KELLEE SAVED MY LIFE WHEN
SHE GAVE ME HER IDOL, AND I DO

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,717
FEEL LIKE I OWE A LOT TO HER.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,805
>> JAMAL, I'M SORRY YOU WASTED
YOUR ID.L. ON ME, AND I'M SORRY

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,639
JACK IS NOT HERE.

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,141
>> WHO WAS THE OTHER JACK?

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,642
>> WHO WAS THE OTHER JACK?

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,480
>> I THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE
ABIDOL, SO I HAD TO VOTE SOMEONE

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,022
TODAY.

21
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,816
IT ENDED UP BEING JACK.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
THAT DIDN'T COME JUST FROM ME.

23
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,652
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:14,115
>> IT WAS KIND OF LIKE ADVISED
IN MY BEST INTERESTS THAT I HAD

25
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:14,783
TO PUT JACK.

26
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,201
>> WHO TOLD YOU TO VOTE JACK?

27
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,368
>> I CAN'T SAY.

28
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,204
I MEAN, I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT
OTHER PEOPLE ON THE CHOPPING

29
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,371
BLOCK.

30
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,792
>> I AM PUTTING YOU IN<i> THE</i>
HARDEST POSITION, AND YOUR

31
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:29,255
CHOICE IS ANSWER IT OR DON'T,
BUT JUST KNOW THAT WHICHEVER

32
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,382
DIRECTION YOU GO THERE ARE GOING
TO BE CONSEQUENCES.

33
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,425
WHO TOLD YOU TO WRITE JACK'S
NAME?

34
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,722
>> I DO FEEL EMDEBTED TO JAMAL.

35
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,016
YOU SAVED MY ASS WITH THAT IDOL.

36
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,850
IT'S KELLEE.

37
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,060
I'M SORRY.

38
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:42,852
SORRY, KELLEE.

39
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,353
I LOVE YOU.

40
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,187
YOU KNOW THAT.

41
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,646
>> IT'S SICKENING.

42
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,230
>> I'M NAUSEOUS.

43
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,983
>> WOW, NOURA.

44
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,485
>> I'M GRATEFUL TO KELLEE.

45
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,695
>> KELLEE IS AN AMAZING PERSON.

46
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,198
>> NOURA CAN, YOU STOP SAYING MY
NAME.

47
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,033
LITERALLY JUST STOP SAYING MY
NAME.

48
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,537
LIKE WE HAD A REALLY TOUGH
TRIBAL, CAN WE JUST TABLE THIS

49
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,037
FOR TOMORROW?

50
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,496
>> OKAY.

51
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,540
>> SORRY, KELLEE.

52
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:08,169
>> OKAY, JAMAL, CAN WE GO TALK
ON THE BEACH?

53
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,337
NOURA IMMEDIATELY FESSES UP.

54
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,338
IT JUST MADE ME SO MAD.

55
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,424
BUT ALL OF WHAT NOURA IS SAYING
IS TRUE.

56
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,720
SO I'M LYING TO WHAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE MY TWO CLOSEST ALLIES IN

57
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,556
THIS GAME, JANET AND JAMAL.

58
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,099
LIKE I AM IN A PICKLE.

59
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:26,187
>> YOU ARE UNEQUIVOCALLY DENYING
HAVING SPOKEN TO NOURA RIGHT

60
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:26,688
BEFORE TRIBAL?

61
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,230
>> YEAH.

62
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,857
>> I DID NOT SAY THAT?

63
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,858
>> THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

64
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,278
>> WHEN DID I GET ONE-ON-ONE
TIME WITH HER TODAY?

65
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,195
>> I DIDN'T.

66
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,739
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE THREW
YOUR NAME OUT.

67
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,075
>> I'M UPSET FOR A LOT OF
REASONS.

68
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,244
>> IT'S CONVOLUTED.

69
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,454
I THINK THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO
COME OUT.

70
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,082
KELLEE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S
OVERWHELMED WITH EMOTION AND IS

71
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,084
STRESSING OUT, BUT SOMETHING
ABOUT IT DOESN'T ADD UP.

72
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,878
>> I'M SORRY.

73
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,047
IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY DOUBT --
>> I DON'T HAVE DOUBT IN MY

74
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:53,840
MIND.

75
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,924
>> I HAVE A LITTLE DOUBT IN MY
MIND.

76
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,261
>> I THINK KELLEE, SAVVY
SURVIVOR PLAYER SHE, IS IS

77
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,806
TRYING THE PLAY AN UNDERGROUND
GAME THAT PLAYED TO THE SURFACE

78
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,641
BECAUSE SHE TRIED TO DO IT WITH
NOURA.

79
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:13,735
YOU NEVER TRY TO PLAY AN
UNDERGROUND GAME WITH NOURA.

80
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:27,165
YOU NEVER TRY TO PLAY AN
UNDERGROUND GAME WITH NOURA.

81
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,418
>> SO THE ASSUMPTION IS THERE IS
AT LEAST ONE IDOL SOMEWHERE ON

82
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,252
THE ISLAND.

83
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,004
>> THERE'S NO IDOL HERE.

84
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:37,634
>> AND THERE IS ON IDOL FRIEND
ZYCH EVERYONE LAST NIGHT SAW

85
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,260
WHAT AN IDOL CAN DO.

86
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,805
THAT'S WHY EVERYONE IS UP AT THE
CRACK OF DAWN THE LOOK FOR THESE

87
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,598
IDOLS.

88
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,849
>> HOPEFULLY I DON'T FIND A
SNAKE.

89
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,312
>> BEFORE I CAME INTO THE GAME,
MY SISTER WAS LIKE, WHEN AN IDOL

90
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,981
PLAYED, GET UP AT DAWN AND DON'T
STOP LOOKING.

91
00:03:52,065 --> 00:04:00,823
AND I'M NOT GOING TO STOP UNTIL
I FIND THIS THING.

92
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,033
>> OH, MY GOD.

93
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,161
OH, MY GOD.

94
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,622
OH, MY GOD.

95
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,374
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE FOUND
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

96
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,709
WHEN POLICE DEPARTMENT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, ANY VOTES CAST AGAINST

97
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,505
YOU WILL NOT COUNT.

98
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:20,343
YOU WANT MORE TOOLS IN YOUR
TOOLBOX THAT YOU CAN USE IN

99
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,595
REALLY CREATIVE WAYS TO HELP YOU
GET FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

100
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,264
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

101
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,392
>> GATHER ROUND, GATHER ROUND.

102
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,688
READY FOR THIS?

103
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:36,734
GRAB YOUR -- [CHEERING]
>> I AM A SURVIVOR FAN.

104
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:42,323
I KNOW WHAT THE WORDS "GATHER
YOUR" MEANS.

105
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:48,037
>> THE MERGE TO ME MEANT A NEW
BEGINNING IN THIS GAME.

106
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,665
>> HEY, LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE.

107
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,376
>> I HAD A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME
THE FIRST HALF OF THIS GAME.

108
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,547
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T HAD A FOOD
REWARD FOR THE FIRST 20 DAYS OF

109
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,798
THE GAME.

110
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,592
I NEVER HAD THAT ONE PICK ME UP
YOU NEED TO GET YOU THROUGH NEXT

111
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,054
FIVE DAYS, SO I WAS JUST
THINKING, FEAST, FEAST, FEAST, I

112
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,764
NEED FOOD.

113
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:14,230
>> OH, HELL, YEAH.

114
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:17,567
>> THE MERGE SIGNIFIES THE NEXT
STAGE OF THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

115
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,236
NOW IT'S GAME ON.

116
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,072
NOW ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT
YOU SOLIDIFIED UP TO THIS POINT,

117
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,784
WE'LL SEE IF THEY MEAN ANYTHING
OR WAS IT JUST ALL SMOKE AND

118
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,452
MIRRORS.

119
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,536
>> JAMES HAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

120
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:34,459
>> HERE'S TO AN ADULT ASS
MASTERING.

121
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,419
LET'S GET LIT
>> GOING INTO THIS MERGE, THE

122
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,423
PEOPLE I WANT TO RECONNECT WITH
ARE JANET AND KELLEE, BECAUSE I

123
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,092
WAS CLOSE TO BOTH OF THEM IN THE
ORIGINAL VOKAI.

124
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,469
>> YOU AND KELLEE.

125
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:50,224
>> UH-HUH.

126
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,934
>> I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.

127
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,604
>> WHY WOULD I POSSIBLY WANT TO
WORK WITH JAMAL?

128
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,813
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

129
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,733
IT'S LIKE HE NOW WANTS TO WORK
WITH ME?

130
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:03,613
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT'S
CONTENTIOUS.

131
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,282
RIGHT NOW I'M SITTING IN THE
MIDDLE SEAT.

132
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,742
DO I GO WITH OLD VOKAI.

133
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,119
WE HAVE 7-6 WITH THE NUMBERS.

134
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,245
IT'S THE EASY ROUTE.

135
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,623
WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER.

136
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,709
OR DO I CHANGE THIS GAME UP AND
GO WITH MY NEW FRIENDS, VOKAI

137
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,126
2.0.

138
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,628
>> OH, DAN, DAN.

139
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,587
>> I'M DONE.

140
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,923
>> I HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

141
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,591
THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE CRAZY.

142
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:32,600
YOU JUST HAVE TO SMILE AND SAY,
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

143
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,269
>> YAY.

144
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,479
>> WELCOME HOME.

145
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,440
>> COMING BACK THE CAMP WITH 13
PEOPLE WAS VERY OVERWHELMING.

146
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,943
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT
SCENARIOS THAT COULD BE RUNNING

147
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,486
THROUGH PEOPLE'S HEADS.

148
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:48,032
THE VOKAI 2.0 PLAN WAS TO STAY
SEVEN STRONG AND THEN BRING IN

149
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,829
JANET AND KELLEE, BECAUSE WE
KNOW THAT AS LAIRO ALONE WE'RE

150
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,208
DOWN ON THE NUMBERS, SO FOR US
TO HAVE A BACK-UP ALLIANCE,

151
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,836
WHERE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS,
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WHAT I WANT TO

152
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,507
MOVE FORWARD WITH.

153
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,717
>> SO WE HAVE SEVEN FOR THE
INITIAL VOTE?

154
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,555
>> THIS IS WHAT THE PLAN IS: SO
THERE'S SEVEN OF US VOKAI.

155
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,514
>> RIGHT.

156
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,016
>> NOT YOU GUYS, LIKE THE ONES
ON OUR TRIBE.

157
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,520
THEY SAID BRING IN JANET AND
KELLEE, THAT'S NINE, AND THAT'S

158
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,354
THE PLAN.

159
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,773
>> THAT WOULD BE REALLY BAD FOR
US.

160
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,401
WE'RE AT THE TOP OF THE OLD
VOKAI.

161
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,736
IF WE GO WITH THE NEW VOKAI,
WE'LL BE AT THE BOTTOM.

162
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,701
TOMMY EXPLAINED THIS VOKAI 2.0
PLUS KELLEE AN JANET CREATING A

163
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,994
NINE-STRONG GROUP.

164
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:37,540
IT'S SO DUMB, BECAUSE WHY WOULD
I TAKE THESE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS

165
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,420
AND SWITCH OVER TO THIS ALLIANCE
OF NINE THAT LITERALLY ONLY

166
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,755
HELPS THE FOUR OLD LAIRO?

167
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,175
>> ALL OF THOSE OLD LAIRO HAVE
TO GO.

168
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,718
I THINK THOSE FOUR ARE THE MOST
DANGEROUS PLAYERS IN THE GAME.

169
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,220
>> BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THEM?

170
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:56,392
>> NO, BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE
LEGITIMATELY GOOD PLAYERS AND

171
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:56,976
CHARMING.

172
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,436
>> LIKE MISSY AND DEAN.

173
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,229
>> DEAN IS NOT REALLY A THREAT.

174
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,400
DEAN KNOW HE'S ON THE BOTTOM OF
THE OLD LAIRO.

175
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,818
>> I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THIS IS
LOOKING.

176
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,112
EVERY IDEA I PITCH GETS SHUT
DOWN.

177
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,240
THEY WERE SO ADAMANT, THEY WERE
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.

178
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,618
BUT MY ALLIANCE SOUTH CAROLINA
GONE TO BE STRAIGHT-UP VOKAI.

179
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,703
MY ALLIANCE ISN'T GOING TO BE
STRAIGHT-UP LAIRO.

180
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,789
MY ALLIANCE IS GOING TO BEST
SERVE ME.

181
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,263
>> WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE, DAN
WAS SUPER KIND AND SUPER

182
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,559
HELPFUL, BUT THEN ONE NIGHT THE
HANDS WERE WANDERING.

183
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,062
>> WAS .E DOING THAT WITH
ELIZABETH, TOO?

184
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,188
>> EVERYBODY.

185
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:47,610
>> BEFORE THE MERGE I HADN'T MET
AARON, ELIZABETH, MISSY.

186
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,654
WE BONDED OVER THE FACT THAT DAN
HAS BEEN EXTREMELY

187
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,571
INAPPROPRIATE.

188
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,450
>> DAY ONE I REFUSED TO SLEEP
NEXT TO DAN.

189
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,286
DAY ONE, KELLEE DOESN'T LIKE
TOUCHING PEOPLE.

190
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,748
I DON'T LIKE TOUCHING PEOPLE
BECAUSE DAN WAS TOUCHING ME.

191
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:05,378
EVEN YESTERDAY HE WAS STILL
TOUCHING ME.

192
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,423
I'M LIKE, DON'T TOUCH MY FACE.

193
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,968
>> TOMMY PUTS HIS ARM AROUND ME
AND IT'S LIKE WHATEVER.

194
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,760
>> IT'S DIFFERENT.

195
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,303
>> HE'S IN THE LIKE THIS.

196
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,806
AND I'M LIKE, WHY ARE YOU
TOUCHING MY RIB CAGE.

197
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,477
>> IT'S A GAME, SO I'M ASSUMING
NOBODY WOULD WANT TO SAY

198
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,728
SOMETHING, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
MAKE A SCENE.

199
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,856
>> IT'S SUPER UPSETTING, BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

200
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,068
THERE ARE ALWAYS CONSEQUENCES
FOR STANDING UP.

201
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,321
THIS HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE NEW
YORK WORK SETTINGS, IN SCHOOL,

202
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,865
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE
IT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOUR UPWARD

203
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,659
TRAJECTORY, IT'S GOING TO AFFECT
HOW PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU.

204
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,829
>> FOR MY MENTAL HEALTH, HE CAN
GO.

205
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,541
HE CAN GO, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
BENEFIT MY GAME TO HAVE TO WORRY

206
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,209
ABOUT LAYING THERE.

207
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:50,298
LIKE I LAY AWAKE, HIS ARM
SMOTHERS ME.

208
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,135
AT THE MERGE FEAST LAST NIGHT,
I'M TALKING WITH JANET ABOUT HER

209
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,845
KIDS, ALMOST GOING TO NAVY
BECAUSE I WENT THE AIR FORCE,

210
00:09:55,928 --> 00:10:01,017
AND I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE WIGGLING
MY TOES.

211
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,394
I'M LIKE, I WONDER WHO IT COULD
BE.

212
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,186
IT'S HIM.

213
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,814
IT'S JUST INAPPROPRIATE
TOUCHING.

214
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,149
I AM NOT AN OBJECT.

215
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:13,112
>> THE FACT THAT IT MAKES ME,
LAURAN, ELIZABETH, MISSY, LIKE

216
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,823
ALL OF US, MOLLY, IT MADE ALL OF
US UNCOMFORTABLE.

217
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,409
LIKE THIS ISN'T JUST ONE PERSON.

218
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,618
IT'S A PATTERN.

219
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:25,207
IT'S PATTERN, AND IT'S LIKE,
YEAH, LIKE IT TAKES FIVE PEOPLE

220
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,170
TO BE LIKE, MAN, LIKE THE WAY
THAT I'M FEELING ABOUT THIS IS

221
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,506
ACTUALLY REAL, LIKE IT'S NOT IN
MY HEAD, LIKE I'M NOT OVERWE

222
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,591
ACTING.

223
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:37,720
IT'S LIKE NO, HE'S LITERALLY
DONE THESE THINGS TO FIVE

224
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,346
DIFFERENT WOMEN IN THIS GAME.

225
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,306
THAT TOTALLY, TOTALLY SUCKS.

226
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,850
>> IF THERE ARE ISSUES TO THE
POINT WHERE THINGS NEED TO

227
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,142
HAPPEN.

228
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,101
>> YEAH.

229
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,520
>> COME TO ME AND I WILL MAKE
SURE THAT STOPS.

230
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,897
>> OKAY.

231
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,068
>> I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE.

232
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,445
LIKE I SAID.

233
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,697
>> I THINK IT WILL STOP BECAUSE
DAN IS SQUARED.

234
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,740
>> I UNDERSTAND.

235
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,202
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS
NOT... IT'S NOT OKAY.

236
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,412
>> YEAH.

237
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:10,753
>> I HAVE A -- KELLEE SCARES THE
HELL OUT OF ME.

238
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,590
LOOK AT HER.

239
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,384
NOW LOOK.

240
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:16,926
MISSY.

241
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,260
>> KELLEE IS DANGEROUS.

242
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,555
WHEN MISSY IS SUPPOSED TO GO
HOME, THEY SAT ON THE BEACH FOR

243
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,224
OVER TWO HOURS.

244
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,058
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

245
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,935
LOOK, I LOVE HER, BUT SHE IS SO
SMART.

246
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,396
SHE WENT TO HARVARD.

247
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,940
AND SHE'S DOWNPLAYED THAT SO
MUCH THAT NO ONE VIEWS HER AS A

248
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,524
THREAT.

249
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,984
SHOULD WE GO KELLEE FIRST?

250
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,152
>> I THINK SO.

251
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:40,449
>> MY BIGGEST THING WITH TOMMY
SAYING KELLEE IS THAT I HAVE

252
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,827
ALWAYS FELT LIKE HER AND I WERE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

253
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,790
BUT SHE'S PROVING TO BE A VERY
DANGEROUS PLAYER IN THIS GAME.

254
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,333
SO CAN I TRUST HER?

255
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:55,840
AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT I COULD?

256
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,426
>> OKAY.

257
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,135
>> YEAH.

258
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,011
>> YOU DON'T LOOK IT.

259
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,848
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

260
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,101
>> NO, IT WAS DAN.

261
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:07,810
I'M JUST A LITTLE UPSET ABOUT
IT.

262
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,980
>> I KNOW.

263
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,482
I KNOW.

264
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,650
IT'S SO UPSETTING.

265
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,152
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THAT.

266
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:16,986
YOU CAN'T IGNORE YOUR FEELINGS.

267
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,155
IT'S HOW YOU FEEL.

268
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,823
IT'S YOUR PERCEPTION OF WHAT'S
GOING ON.

269
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,074
>> YEAH, THIS IS LIKE A PROBLEM.

270
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:27,163
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE MOLLY AND I
WERE LIKE, OH, NO, IT'S US, LIKE

271
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,956
WE JUST GET WEIRD VIBES FROM
HIM.

272
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,166
BUT NEW YORK IT'S NOT.

273
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:36,088
>> INITIALLY MY TAKE ON DAN WAS
HE WAS JUST AN OLD-SCHOOL GUY

274
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,467
THAT NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

275
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,679
YOU KNOW, BEING PHYSICAL OR ARM
AROUND A SHOULDER OR, YOU KNOW,

276
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,556
STUFF I WOULD DO WITH MY
LIFEGUARDS.

277
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,601
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST A VERY
PHYSICAL PERSON.

278
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:53,022
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I CANNOT
IGNORE THESE GIRLS.

279
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:57,526
I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING, AND IF
I SEE ANYTHING, I'M GOING TO

280
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,736
CONFRONT.

281
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,862
ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT DAN IS
TOTALLY INNOCENT, HE'S GOING TO

282
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,864
BE DEVASTATED.

283
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:08,787
IT'S A TRICKY THING TO HAVE 100%
PROOF.

284
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,582
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET IT.

285
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,375
>> HOW WAS LAST NIGHT?

286
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,043
WHAT HAPPENED?

287
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:19,715
>> WELK HE DIDN'T TOUCH ME.

288
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,258
>> I DIDN'T GET TOUCHED AT ALL.

289
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,384
IT WAS GREAT.

290
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,054
KELLEE OPENED UP TO ME ABOUT HOW
HER AND MOLLY FELT VERY

291
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,305
UNCOMFORTABLE.

292
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:30,559
I TOLD HER THAT WE FELT VERY,
VERY SIMILAR AND WE CAN ALL BAND

293
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,020
TOGETHER TO GET DAN OUT.

294
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,189
SO SHE'S TALKING THE JANET.

295
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,234
SHE MAY ASK YOU HOW YOU FELT
ABOUT SLEEPING IN CAMP.

296
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,818
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S ASKING ABOUT.

297
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,070
TELL HER HOW UNCOMFORTABLE YOU
ARE.

298
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,907
LIKE YOU HAVE A VERY OPEN THING.

299
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,117
RIGHT NOW THAT'S OUR ONLY PLAN.

300
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,371
>> THE MASTERING IS ABOUT
NUMBERS, SO RIGHT NOW MY JOB IS

301
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,164
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE

302
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,415
NUMBERS.

303
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,919
THE ORIGINAL VOKAI ARE NOT THE
BIGGEST FAN OF DAN, SO IF I CAN

304
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:02,132
PLAY UP THAT CARD AND$ATEVER
WAY POSSIBLE, I'LL DO IT.

305
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,094
>> I'M LIKE VERY AWARE OF WHERE
LAIRO STANDS.

306
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,262
>> YEAH.

307
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:11,141
>> BUT YOU THROW OUT THE DAN
NAME, AND THAT'S BEEN A NAME

308
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,603
THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
SINCE WE GOT HERE, LIKE FOR

309
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,271
OBVIOUS REASONS.

310
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,605
I THINK YOU KNOW.

311
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,856
>> YEAH.

312
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,734
>> BECAUSE THE FIRST FEW NIGHTS
THAT WE WERE HERE, I WAS NEXT TO

313
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,944
HIM.

314
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,280
HE WOULD HAVE HIS HANDS RIGHT
HERE, AND HE WOULD BE LIKE, HEY,

315
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,239
IS THIS OKAY?

316
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,907
AND I'M LIKE...

317
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:27,449
>> NO.

318
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,284
>> UM...

319
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,662
>> IF YOU HAVE TO ASK, PROBABLY
NO.

320
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,456
>> DESPITE ME SAYING I DON'T
LIKE TO BE TOUCHED, HE CONTINUED

321
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,666
TO TOUCH ME.

322
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,836
HE'S LITERALLY TRIED TO PUT HIS
FINGERS IN MY HAIR TO RUB MY

323
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,628
SCALP YESTERDAY.

324
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,966
I PROBABLY NEED TO WASH MY HAIR,
TOO.

325
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:50,222
>> I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, I WAS
LOOKING THE SEE HOW MUCH SAND

326
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,517
THERE WAS.

327
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,560
>> UH.

328
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,895
>> MY HANDS ARE CLEAN
>> YOUR HANDS ARE NOT CLEAN

329
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,148
>> OH, MY GOD, I JUST SCRUBBED
THEM IN THE WATER.

330
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,444
>> DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BLOW UP
OUR GAME IF WE SAID SOMETHING.

331
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,821
>> OH, I THOUGHT YOU MEANT TO
VOTE HIM OUT

332
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,157
>> I DO WANT TO VOTE DAN OUT,
THIS TIME, NEXT TIME, WHENEVER.

333
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,159
I WANT TO VOTE DAN OUT.

334
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,327
>> LET ME KNOW.

335
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,369
I'LL BE THERE.

336
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:16,165
>> BUT AS MUCH AS I FEEL
DISRESPECTED BY HIM AND FEEL

337
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,001
DISGUSTED BY HIM, I'M NOT GOING
TO MAKE A GAME DECISION BASED

338
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,670
OFF OF THOSE FEELINGS.

339
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,130
LOOK, I'M UPSET WITH THE WAY
HE'S BEEN BEHAVING.

340
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:27,885
THAT IS THE FAIR THING TO DO,
BUT THIS GAME IS NOT FAIR.

341
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,511
I'M IN THE PLAYING THIS GAME TO
BE FAIR.

342
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,013
I'M PLAYING THIS GAME TO WIN.

343
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,851
SO DAN MAKES SENSE AS A DECOY
VOTE, BUT IS HE REALLY THE

344
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,144
PERSON WE WANT TO GET OUT?

345
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,814
>> THIS IS WHAT IS ABOUT TO
HAPPEN.

346
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,358
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING.

347
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,028
THE PLAN IS TO GET YOU.

348
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,324
THAT'S THEIR PLAN.

349
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,284
KELLEE KNOWING THAT PULLED YOU
ASIDE FOR TWO OURSELVES.

350
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,370
>> WHY WOULD SHE PULL ME ASIDE
THEN?

351
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,872
>> TO TRY TO MAKE YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE.

352
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:57,498
>> OKAY.

353
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,875
>> DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE?

354
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,459
>> YEAH.

355
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,377
>> DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT?

356
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,169
>> YEAH.

357
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,254
>> ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS WITH
ME?

358
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,884
>> I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE REAL
WITH ANYBODY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

359
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:17,559
>> SHE REALLY WAS TALKING FOR
TWO HOURS ABOUT LIFE, MISSY.

360
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:22,439
>> LAURAN SAID KELLEE AND HER
MOTLEY CRUE ARE COMING FOR YOU.

361
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,733
DO I TRUST LAURAN AND TOMMY TO
SAVE ME.

362
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,029
>> THEY DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS
WITHOUT TOMMY AND I, BUT THE

363
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,781
WEST THING WOULD BE FOR YOU TO
WIN IMMUNITY.

364
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,410
>> IF KELLEE THINKS THAT SHE'S
GOING TO GET ME OUT, THE VERY

365
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:39,456
FIRST MERGE VOTE, I FEEL AS
THOUGH THAT I CAN MAKE A MOVE.

366
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,586
I CAN'T GO OUT LIKE A PUNK.

367
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:32,634
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

368
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,761
ALL RIGHT.

369
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,304
FIRST THINGS FIRST, TAKE BACK
THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

370
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:42,686
THANK YOU, KARISHMA.

371
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,607
TRIBAL IMMUNITY NO MORE.

372
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,818
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS WHAT YOU
COVET.

373
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,323
THIS IS WHAT KEEPS YOU SAFE IN
THE GAME.

374
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,284
A TABLE HAS THREE BALLS ON TOP.

375
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,663
EVERY TIME YOU LOW THEIR TABLE,
IT LOCKS INTO A NEW POSITION,

376
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,332
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT.

377
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,710
YOU GET TOO LOW, A BALL WILL
DROP.

378
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,172
WHEN ALL YOU BALLS ARE GONE,
YOU'RE OUT.

379
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,383
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE,

380
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,720
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE EIGHTH

381
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,682
PERSON VOTES OUT OF THIS GAME.

382
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,310
TAKE YOUR SPOTS, LET'S DO IT AND
WE'LL GET STARTED.

383
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:29,733
ONE IS DOWN THERE, 13 IS HERE.

384
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,859
ALL RIGHT.

385
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:37,658
EVERYBODY GENTLY LIFT YOUR
HANDLES.

386
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,369
EVERYBODY LIFT.

387
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,287
EVERYBODY IS GOOD.

388
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:52,047
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

389
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,217
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE,
ELIZABETH DROPS HER FIRST BALL

390
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,344
AND NOURA DROPS HER FIRST BALL.

391
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,680
YOU HAVE THREE.

392
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,890
NO NEED TO PANIC.

393
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,061
EVERY TIME YOU DROP A BALL, LIKE
DEAN JUST DID, THAT'S A WARNING

394
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,188
THAT YOU'RE MOVING JUST A
LITTLE.

395
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,858
THERE ARE PEGS UNDERNEATH EACH
BALL.

396
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,695
EVERY TIME YOU LOWER THAT TABLE,
THE PEG UNDERNEATH THAT BALL IS

397
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,240
PUSHING UP MORE AND MORE AND
WHEN IT PUSHES ENOUGH, IT WILL

398
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,451
PUSH YOUR BALL OUT.

399
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,454
NOURA DROPS A SECOND BALL NOW.

400
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:30,294
NOURA DOWN TO HER LAST BALL.

401
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
KELLEE DROPS HER SECOND.

402
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,255
NOURA DROPS HER THIRD BALL.

403
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,592
NOW IS THE FIRST ONE OUT.

404
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,426
STEP OFF THE BACK.

405
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,594
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

406
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:43,265
YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE STRUGGLING
ALREADY FOR BODY POSITION.

407
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,266
KELLEE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

408
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,768
KELLEE IS OUT.

409
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,605
THE KEY IS HOW STRAIGHT CAN YOU
STAY.

410
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,898
DEAN DROPS THE SECOND BALL.

411
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,524
HE'S DOWN ONE NOW.

412
00:19:52,608 --> 00:20:00,407
JANET DROPS HER FIRST BALL.

413
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,409
DEAN DROPS HIS THIRD BALL.

414
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,744
HE'S OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

415
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,953
WE'RE DOWN TO TEN.

416
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,457
LOTS OF PEOPLE WORKING THEIR
BODIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS TRYING

417
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,666
TO FIND SOMEWHERE COMFORTABLE.

418
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,172
THE RISK YOU TAKE EVERY TIME YOU
LOWER IS THAT RATCHET TO YOUR

419
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:20,427
LEFT LOCKS IN A LITTLE LOWER AND
NOW YOU HAVE LESS ROOM TO

420
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,970
MANEUVER.

421
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:22,638
JANET DROPS THE SECOND BALL.

422
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,598
ELAINE DROPS THE SECOND BALL.

423
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,599
SHE'S DOWN TO ONE.

424
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,476
DAN DROPS HIS FIRST BALL.

425
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,353
JANET CAN'T HANG ON ANY LONGER.

426
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,313
SHE'S OUT.

427
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,108
LAURAN DROPS HER FIRST BALL.

428
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,153
THIS IS INSURANCE AND PAIN
THRESHOLD.

429
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,697
THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE.

430
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,491
DAN TRIES TO REPOSITION AND
DROPS A SECOND BALL.

431
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:47,496
DAN DOWN TO HIS LAST BALL.

432
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,997
ELAINE DROPS.

433
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,502
SHE IS OUT.

434
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,378
LAURAN DROPS BOTH BALLS AT ONCE.

435
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,172
LAURAN IS NOW OUT.

436
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:57,506
DAN DROPS.

437
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,507
HE'S OUT.

438
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,509
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY FOR DAN.

439
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,846
WE'RE DOWN TO SIX.

440
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,809
MISSY DROPS HER FIRST BALL.

441
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,018
JAMAL DROPS HIS FIRST BALL.

442
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,812
HE'S DOWN TO TWO.

443
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:17,526
IT IS ELIZABETH, JAMAL AND MISSY
EACH WITH TWO BALLS LEFT.

444
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,362
TOMMY, KARISHMA ANAARON WITH
THREE.

445
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,154
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

446
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,699
>> YOU GOT IT, KARISHMA.

447
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,366
>> Jeff: KARISHMA DROPS HER
FIRST BALL.

448
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,743
>> HANG IN THERE, GUYS.

449
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,371
>> Jeff: THERE IS NOWHERE
COMFORTABLE.

450
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,915
KARISHMA DROPS ANOTHER BALL.

451
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,208
YOU HAVE TO DIG IN.

452
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,252
YOU CAN STILL WIN IT.

453
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,213
YOU JUST NEED ONE BALL ON THAT
TABLE WHENNITES OVER.

454
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:38,880
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.

455
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,424
TOMMY DROPS HIS FIRST BALL.

456
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,634
KARISHMA DROPS HER FINAL BALL.

457
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,927
SHE IS OUT.

458
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,971
>> STAY FOCUSED, TOMMY.

459
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:46,555
>> WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.

460
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,558
>> DON'T BLOW IT, TOMMY.

461
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:54,229
>> Jeff: TOMMY GIVES OUT.

462
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,231
OUT OF NOWHERE LOSES EVERYTHING.

463
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:56,940
TOMMY IS OUT.

464
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,774
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.

465
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,026
TWO WOMEN, TWO MEN.

466
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:03,905
ELIZABETH AND MISSY ON THE ENDS,
AARON AND JAMAL IN THE MIDDLE.

467
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:09,745
BIG EFFORT RIGHT NOW.

468
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,247
SWEAT DRIPPING FROM EVERYBODY.

469
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,750
BODIES IN ALL SORTS OF
POSITIONS.

470
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,792
CONSTANTLY MOVING.

471
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,920
IF YOU LOSE FOCUS FOR A SECOND,
YOU CAN DROP A BALL.

472
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,589
YOU HAVE TO STAY IN THIS
MENTALLY.

473
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:30,599
YOU HAVE TO PUSH THROUGH THE
PAIN.

474
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:37,939
YOU HAVE TO PUSH THROUGH THE
PAIN.

475
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,025
>> DAMN
>> SUPER IMPRESSIVE.

476
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,110
>> Jeff: KEEP FIGHTING!

477
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,945
KEEP DIGGING IN!

478
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:51,119
DON'T LOSE YOUR FOCUS AND START
TO DRIFT.

479
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,245
MISSY DROPS.

480
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:52,746
MISSY IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

481
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,457
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.

482
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,417
>> CAREFUL.

483
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,335
BE CAREFUL.

484
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,044
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH GOING DOWN.

485
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,629
ELIZABETH DROPPING ANOTHER BALL.

486
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,465
ELIZABETH DOWN TO ONE NOW.

487
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,466
AARON WITH THREE.

488
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,093
JAMAL WITH TWO.

489
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,469
AARON DROPS HIS FIRST BALL.

490
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,640
FIRST SIGN OF ANYTHING FROM
AARON INDICATING A WEAKNESS.

491
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,184
>> YOU GOT IT.

492
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,310
KEEP HOLDING.

493
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,604
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH CAN'T HANG
IN ANY LONGER AFTER A HUGE

494
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,021
EFFORT.

495
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,981
BODY TREMBLING.

496
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:20,941
ELIZABETH IS OUT.

497
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,109
AND WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.

498
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,487
IT'S A SHOWDOWN.

499
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,698
IT IS AARON AND JAMAL, BOTH WITH
TWO BALLS LEFT.

500
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,493
VERY, VERY HOT DAY HERE IN FIJI.

501
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,536
>> FOCUS, FOCUS.

502
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,996
>> Jeff: THIS IS IT.

503
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,040
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GIVE OUT.

504
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:47,134
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE YOU.

505
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:53,807
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE YOU.

506
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,025
>> IMPRESSIVE, GUYS.

507
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,527
>> Jeff: YOU GOT TO REMIND
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW TO KEEP DOING

508
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,323
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE DOING,
BECAUSE IT'S WORKING.

509
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,200
IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW UGLY IT
LOOKS.

510
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:17,372
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOUR
BODY IS SHAKING, QUIVERING, HOW

511
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,331
MANY TIMES YOU A.

512
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,499
JUST NONE OF IT MATTERS.

513
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,377
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS
KEEPING THAT TABLE IN CHECK,

514
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,337
KEEPING THOSE BALLS IN PLACE.

515
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,672
>> GOOD WORK, BABY.

516
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:29,426
GOOD WORK, BABY.

517
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,886
>> STAY FOCUSED.

518
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,469
STAY IN THE MOMENT.

519
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:40,729
>> YOU LOVE IT.

520
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,023
>> OH.

521
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,568
>> Jeff: JAMAL STRUGGLING TO
GET OFF THE PLATFORM.

522
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,861
>> AM I GOOD?

523
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:48,904
AM I GOOD?

524
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,447
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD, AARON.

525
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:58,246
AARON WINS THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE OF THE

526
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,456
SEASON.

527
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,917
JAMAL'S TRIBE MATES RUSH OVER TO
SEE IF HE'S OKAY.

528
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,752
JAMAL, DO YOU WANT MEDICAL?

529
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,254
>> EXCELLENT EFFORT.

530
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,883
>> OUT OF EVERYONE IN THIS GAME,
MISSY IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO

531
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,051
WIN.

532
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,554
THIS GIRL IS SMART, LIKE SHE IS
THINKING THE WAY THAT I AM

533
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,764
THINKING.

534
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,099
I 1,000% WANT TO WORK WITH HER.

535
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,726
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE
IN THE GAME TO DO THAT.

536
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,812
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NAIL IN
HER COFFIN.

537
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:36,451
>> AARON, CONGRATS AGAIN.

538
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:42,123
>> CONGRATS.

539
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,291
>> DAMN.

540
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,127
I NEEDED TO WIN THAT ONE,
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT KELLEE IS

541
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,297
COMING FOR ME, SO GOING INTO THE
CHALLENGE KNOWING THAT I NEED TO

542
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,634
WEAR THE NECKLACE AND LOSING,
THAT SUCKS.

543
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,719
I'M JUST SCARED.

544
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,055
>> I'M SCARED.

545
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:01,309
>> I WOULD NOT APPROACH YOU IF I
WASN'T GENUINE.

546
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:08,608
>> WE'RE STILL --
>> TONIGHT WE'RE GOING AFTER

547
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,403
KELLEE, BUT THE PLAN DOESN'T
WORK UNLESS TOMMY AND LAURAN ARE

548
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,570
TELLING THE TRUTH.

549
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:17,325
>> YES, IT'S EASY TO BE LIKE
VOKAI, WE'RE ALL GOING TO STAY

550
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,788
STRONG, BUT I KNOW WHERE TOMMY
AND I ARE, AND THIS IS ON THE

551
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,914
BOTTOM.

552
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,041
>> YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING WE
FLIP NOW AND THEN GAME ON?

553
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,918
>> YES.

554
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,005
>> WE TAKE OUT KELLEE.

555
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,549
>> TOMMY AND LAURAN WANT TO GET
OUT KELLEE.

556
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:36,177
AND I THINK TO MYSELF, DAMN,
THAT PUTS ME IN A TOUGH SPOT.

557
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,473
HERE'S A GIRL THAT JUST SAVED MY
LIFE, GAVE ME A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

558
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,018
IDOL, AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO
VOTE HER OUT.

559
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,853
TO BE HONEST, I DON'T KNOW IF I
CAN DO IT.

560
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:52,319
>> SO WE WERE THINKING THE FIVE
LAIRO, DAN, LAURAN, MYSELF.

561
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,194
THAT'S EIGHT.

562
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:53,862
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

563
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,822
>> I'M SO DOWN WITH THAT, DUDE.

564
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,533
I WOULD DO A BACKFLIP RIGHT NOW
IF I COULD.

565
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:02,829
>> WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

566
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,332
>> LAURAN AND I WANT TO VOTE
KELLEE OUT.

567
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:05,957
WE NEED TO WOK TOGETHER.

568
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:06,875
>> I 5400% AGREE.

569
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,792
I'M DOWN.

570
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:12,881
>> SO TONIGHT IT'S KELLEE?

571
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,840
>> IS THAT A LIE?

572
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,051
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A LIE.

573
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,887
>> LAURAN TOLD ME THAT I'M FIRST
TO GO.

574
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,430
SO I THINK THEY'RE DOWN FOR
REAL.

575
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,056
>> ALL RIGHT.

576
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:26,186
LET'S GO.

577
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,564
>> I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH NOT
TRYING TO MAKE EMOTIONAL VOTES

578
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:33,109
OUT HERE, TRYING MAKE A LOGICAL
VOTE, BUT...

579
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,319
>> YEAH, 110%.

580
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:38,740
>> FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT,
WHY WOULD I KEEP DAN, WHO HAS

581
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,700
PUT MY NAME OUT THERE, WHO IS
TALKING ABOUT ME.

582
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,910
>> YES!

583
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,246
>> SO I'M WONDERING WHERE YOUR
APPETITE IS FOR MAKING A MOVE

584
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,414
WITH ME.

585
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,209
>> IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU BRING
THIS UP, BECAUSE DAN HAS RUBBED

586
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,921
PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY AND ON A
HUMAN LEVEL, I'M LIKE REALLY

587
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:53,380
DISGUSTED.

588
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,172
>> YES.

589
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:59,052
>> TONIGHT I'M VOTING FOR D-A-N,
DAN.

590
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:03,098
WHAT REALLY MADE IT SIMPLE FOR
ME IS HE'S MADE A LOT OF WOMEN

591
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,557
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

592
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,227
HE'S KIND OF PUSHED THE
BOUNDARIES OF, YOU KNOW,

593
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,730
SNUGGLING AT NIGHT AND BEING
FLIRTATIOUS, AND THIS IS NOT

594
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,940
OKAY.

595
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,317
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT TO GET
TO THE END AND THEN HAVE SOME

596
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,985
TALK ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR.

597
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,070
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS NOW.

598
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,405
>> WHY WAIT?

599
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:18,947
LET'S JUST DO IT.

600
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,823
>> THIS IS SO AMAZING.

601
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,409
I'M SO HAPPY.

602
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,326
>> ALL RIGHT.

603
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:31,626
CONTAIN IT.

604
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,127
>> RIGHT NOW.

605
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,795
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

606
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,463
CAN WE DO IT?

607
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:35,964
DO WE HAVE ENOUGH?

608
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,589
>> DONE.

609
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,549
>> PROMISE ME?

610
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,091
>> DONE.

611
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:38,925
>> OKAY.

612
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,176
IT'S DONE.

613
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,847
>> WHEN JAMAL TOLD ME THAT WE'RE
GOING TO VOTE DAN OUT TONIGHT, I

614
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:49,436
FELT A GREAT DEAL OF RELIEF,
BECAUSE SOME OF THE GIRLS HAVE

615
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,982
COME TO ME UPSET ABOUT BEING IN
HIS PRESENCE.

616
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:58,319
AND JAMAL COMING TO ME LIKE
THAT, IT JUST CONFIRMED IN MY

617
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,448
HEART THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

618
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:06,035
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME,
BECAUSE I REALLY, REALLY DO LIKE

619
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,078
DAN.

620
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,707
HOWEVER, THIS IS A MORAL
DECISION THAT I'M MAKING.

621
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,877
I JUST HAVE A PERSONAL EMOTIONAL
NEED TO HAVE THESE GIRLS FEEL

622
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,962
OKAY.

623
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,048
SO I'M GOING TO DO WHAT'S BEST
FOR THEM.

624
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:24,971
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING?

625
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,514
>> WE ARE VOTING DAN.

626
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,348
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

627
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,310
>> ACTUALLY, AFTER THIS MEETING
TODAY --

628
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,521
>> WELL, I'VE BEEN TRYING THE
TAKE CARE ALL OF YOU GIRL, YOU

629
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,523
KNOW THAT, SO DO ME FAVOR.

630
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,525
TELL ALL THE OLD LAIRO TO GO FOR
HIM.

631
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,026
WE'RE GOING TO BLOW HIM UP
TONIGHT.

632
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:38,985
>> OKAY.

633
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,822
>> JANET APPROACHED ME ABOUT
VOTING DAN OUT.

634
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,492
AND I KNOW FOR A FACT SHE'S
LYING TO MY FACE.

635
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:49,704
WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO
VOTE FOR MISSY, SO THIS DAN TALK

636
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,247
IS SMOKE AND MIRRORS.

637
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,918
THAT'S JANET'S PLAN TO PULL THE
WOOL OVER MY EYES AN I'M LIKE,

638
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,711
YEAH, JANET, YOU GOT IT GIRL.

639
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,589
>> I'M ON THE HONOR SYSTEM.

640
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:05,845
>> WHEN YOU'RE GONE, MISSY --
>> I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

641
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,556
UNCOMFORTABLE SAYING, OH, HE
LIKES TO CUDDLE.

642
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,186
HE'S TOUCHY FEEL, BUT HONESTLY,
I HAVE FELT SAFE THIS ENTIRE

643
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,231
TIME, AND IF I HAD FELT
UNCOMFORTABLE, I WOULD HAVE

644
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:22,111
SAID, PLEASE STOP.

645
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,115
SO I'M WRITING DOWN KELLEE'S
NAME, AN I AM HOPING SEVEN OTHER

646
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,409
PEOPLE DO, AS WELL.

647
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:32,038
>> SO YOU WANT ALL OF US TO VOTE
FOR DAN?

648
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:37,293
>> SHE WAS LIKE, GET ALL YOUR
GIRLS ON BOARD, SO I TOLD HER

649
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,755
THAT ALL OF US ARE.

650
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,091
>> I THINK IT WOULD SOLIDIFY HIM
WITH US.

651
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,300
>> OKAY.

652
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,054
>> AND IF JANET COMES UP TO YOU,
ALL THE GIRLS ARE ON BOARD,

653
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,431
BECAUSE WE ALL FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE.

654
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,059
>> OKAY.

655
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:57,313
>> SHE WAS TOLD TO VOTE YOU.÷p=>
>> UH-HUH.

656
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:01,651
>> I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD
KNOW.

657
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,443
DON'T GET SWIRLED.

658
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,195
>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

659
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,238
>> I TRUST YOU.

660
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,948
I THINK I TRUST MISSY.

661
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,740
SCREW THEM.

662
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,908
I'M SO OVER THEM.

663
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:13,496
THEY'RE SO UNTRUSTWORTHY AND
SO... I CAN'T FATHOM WHY JANET

664
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,455
WOULD TARGET ME.

665
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,623
I'VE NEVER BEEN AFTER JANET.

666
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,001
SHE WAS SOMEONE I THOUGHT I
COULD GO DEEP WITH I WANTED TO

667
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,294
PROTECTED.

668
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:26,593
SO WHAT SHE'S DOING NOW IS BOTH
STUPID AND REPREHENSIBLE TO ME.

669
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:35,685
>> I WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL
ABOUT HOW I DO, THIS BUT...

670
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:39,772
>> HOW MANY VOTES CAN YOU PUT ON
DAN?

671
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,150
>> I THOUGHT WE HAD THE VOTE
LOCKED.

672
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,320
BUT NOW JAMAL WANTS TO VOTE OUT
DAN.

673
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,155
AND I'M WORRIED.

674
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,990
I WAS JUST SITTING THERE.

675
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,201
EVERYONE IS IN A GROUP LAUGHING,
AND I'M LIKE, SOMETHING IS OFF.

676
00:31:52,285 --> 00:32:00,168
>> DAN IS WAY TOO QUIET RIGHT
NOW.

677
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,129
>> I THINK WE SHOULD HELP THEM.

678
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,214
>> THAT'S WHAT'S FREAKING ME
OUT.

679
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,301
WE'VE SWITCHED THE VOTE FROM
MISSY TO DAN.

680
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:12,513
BUT NOW I'M JUST LIKE GETTING
MORE AND MORE NERVOUS.

681
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,225
FORTUNATELY I FOUND AN IDOL ON
THE OID LAIRO BEACH, SO I WILL

682
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,478
BE FINE.

683
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,146
HOWEVER, GOING IN THE MERGE,
HISTORICALLY IN "SURVIVOR,"

684
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:24,317
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ANOTHER
IDOL, AND IF THERE IS AN IDOL ON

685
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,863
THIS BEACH, I WANT IT.

686
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,990
>> WE TOLD YOU MISSY, RIGHT?

687
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,909
>> YES.

688
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,993
ALL RIGHT.

689
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:38,498
WHAT COULD BE IN THE WORKS IS
JUST A CLEAN DAN VOTE.

690
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,207
>> TONIGHT?

691
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,208
>> YEAH.

692
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,711
>> I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO GO INTO
PRESERVATION MODE.

693
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,089
THE ONLY ONE HERE THAT I KNOW
FOR SURE WILL TRY TO RALLY

694
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,716
AGAINST ME IS DAN.

695
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,845
SO I'M ASKING YOU
>> OKAY.

696
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,055
I'M DOWN.

697
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,226
>> JAMAL IS NOW TRYING TO GATHER
UP THE TROOPS TO GET OUT DAN.

698
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,397
I KNEW MERGE WAS GOING TO BE
NUTS, BUT, DAMN.

699
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,774
JAMAL WAS LIKE, WE HAVE TO PUT
DAN.

700
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,149
>> I'M LIKE STRESSED.

701
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,277
>> SO AM I.

702
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,237
WE'RE MAKING THE DECISION.

703
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,406
WE CAN GO EITHER WITCH WAY.

704
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,573
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

705
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,577
AT THIS POINT HALF THE PEOPLE
ARE LIKE LET'S VOTE OUT DAN.

706
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,081
AND THE OTHER HALF OF THESE
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, LET'S GET RED

707
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,249
OF KELLEE.

708
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,252
SO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO MAKE A LOT

709
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,753
OF PEOPLE MAD.

710
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,590
BUT, DAMN, IT'S NICE TO HAVE A
LITTLE POWER.

711
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:34,721
>> THERE'S A BUNCH OF ROCKS WITH
LITTLE CREVICES, AND AS I'M

712
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:42,228
CLIMBING UP, I SEE A GLIPT --
GLINT OF BLUE, AND I'M LIKE, OH,

713
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,105
MY GOD, I JUST FOUND IT.

714
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,233
HOLY CRAP.

715
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,484
THIS IS HUGE.

716
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,113
IT FEELS REALLY GOOD TO HAVE TWO
IDOLS IN MY POCKET, BUT THERE'S

717
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,783
A LOT OF PRESSURE TO USE THIS
IDOL CORRECTLY TO, PLAY IT

718
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,993
RIGHT.

719
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,079
TO NOT GET VOTED OUT WITH TWO
IDOLS IN MY POCKET AND BE THE

720
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,289
BIGGEST "SURVIVOR" SUCKER EVER.

721
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,958
I DEFINITELY DID NOT EXPECT TO
THINK ABOUT EVEN PLAYING IT FOR

722
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,001
MYSELF TONIGHT.

723
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,379
BUT THE WAY THIS IS GOING, I
MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE TO.

724
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:34,071
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

725
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,211
ALL RIGHT.

726
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,881
SO 13 PEOPLE
BEACH.

727
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,550
DAN, GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE
VIBE.

728
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,303
>> WELL, IT'S A WEIRD GAME OF
SHUFFLING PARTIES AND WHICH

729
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,513
PARTIES ARE TALKING.

730
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:03,518
SO IT IS WEIRD, BECAUSE AS MUCH
AS THE GAME OF DECEPTION, IT'S

731
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,019
GOT TO BE A GAME OF TRUST.

732
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,229
AT LEAST FOR ME.

733
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,356
I'M IN A PROFESSION IF I TELL
ONE LIE ONCE TO ONE CLIENT, I'M

734
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,398
FIRED.

735
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,191
PERIOD.

736
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,360
AND SO YOU'RE FORCED TO DO IT
HERE.

737
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,988
I THINK TRUST ACTUALLY OUTWEIGHS
DECEPTION IN THIS GAME.

738
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,865
>> MISSY, DO YOU AGREE WITH
THAT?

739
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,033
>> YOU HAVE TO TRUST SOMEONE.

740
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:22,745
IF YOU TRUST NO ONE, THEN YOU'RE
PLAYING ON YOUR OWN ISLAND

741
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,538
AGAINST 12 OTHER PEOPLE.

742
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:28,167
SO, YEAH, TRUST IS BUILT
SOMETIMES.

743
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,253
>> Jeff: KARISHMA, WHERE DO
YOU STAND WITH THIS IDEA THAT

744
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,672
TRUST IS A BIGGER FACTOR THAN
DECEPTION?

745
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,715
>> YEAH, I AGREE.

746
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,052
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT ACHIEVE THE
DECEPTION REQUIRED IN THIS GAME

747
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:40,721
WITHOUT THE TRUST FIRST.

748
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,515
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT
PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT

749
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,225
TO BE HAVING CONVERSATIONS.

750
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,270
AND I THINK THAT'S PEOPLE TRYING
TO JUST GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER

751
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,940
ON A NEW LEVEL, ON A DEEPER
LEVEL.

752
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,693
>> Jeff: WHICH, LAURAN, LEADS
THE STRATEGIZING.

753
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,946
DID YOU FEEL THAT TENSION OF
SHARKS IN THE WATER.

754
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,074
I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
DOESN'T SOUND SCARY, BUT WHAT'S

755
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,076
HAPPENING BETWEEN THEM IS
TERRIFYING.

756
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,202
>> ABSOLUTELY.

757
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,412
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

758
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,582
LIKE I WAS TRYING TO GET TO KNOW
DEAN AND KARISHMA, AND I FEEL

759
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,669
LIKE ANY ALONE TIME WE HAD,
PEOPLE'S ANTENNAS ARE UP, WHEN

760
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:16,048
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY 30th
BIRTHDAY CARNIVAL.

761
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,301
I FEEL LIKE AGAIN, IT GOES BACK
TO TRUSTING THE PEOPLE YOU

762
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,387
TRUST, AND I DO BELIEVE TRUST
OUTWEIGHS DECEPTION IN THIS

763
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,597
GAME.

764
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,766
>> Jeff: KELLEE, WHEN YOU HEAR
THAT ANSWER, HOW MUCH OF IT GOES

765
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,313
RIGHT PAST YOU AND, YEAH, ALL I
KNOW IS I SAW YOU TALKING SO AND

766
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,315
SO AND MY ANTENNA WAS UP?

767
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,443
>> THIS GAME MAKES YOU VERY
SOCIALLY AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING

768
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:35,985
ON AROUND YOU.

769
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,278
IT MAKES YOU PRESENT.

770
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,489
IF YOU'RE NOT BEING PRESENT, YOU
PROBABLY AREN'T PLAYING THE GAME

771
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,616
THE WAY YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING.

772
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,952
>> Jeff: SO IS TONIGHT'S VOTE
FOR YOU ABOUT TRUST OR

773
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,787
DECEPTION?

774
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,623
>> UM...

775
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,750
>> Jeff: THAT'S THE SAME
QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKING.

776
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,293
WHY DOES IT STRIKE YOU AS FUNNY?

777
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,503
>> SHE JUST ANALYZES EVERYTHING.

778
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,840
>> UM, I THINK IT'S ABOUT TRUST.

779
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,966
YEAH.

780
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,845
>> Jeff: TOMMY, THE IDEA OF
THE ORIGINAL VOKAI NOW BACK

781
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,973
TOGETHER JUST DOMINATING THIS
GAME, HAS THAT BEEN DISCUSSED?

782
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,183
>> YEAH, OF COURSE.

783
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,102
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE I'VE KNOWN
SINCE DAY ONE OF "SURVIVOR."

784
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,105
I MET DEAN AND KARISHMA TWO DAYS
AGO.

785
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:17,026
SO WHEN WE MERGED, WE SAID,
WHOA, THERE'S A LOT MORE VOKAI

786
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,653
THAN OLD LAIRO.

787
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,655
IT'S AN EASY WAY TO GO.

788
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,908
>> Jeff: JANET, DO YOU THINK
TRIBAL LINES WILL HOLD FIRM,

789
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,659
VOKAI HAS THIS.

790
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,826
IF YOU'RE WEARING ORANGE, SEE
YOU?

791
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,248
>> YOU WANT TO HOPE AND THINK
THAT THE OLD VOKAI WILL HOLD

792
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,335
TIGHT, BUT YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO
KNOW PEOPLE, AND AS TIME WEARS

793
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:39,298
ON, TRIBAL LINES CAN BE
SOFTENED.

794
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,842
>> Jeff: DEAN, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?

795
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,388
>> JEFF, I FEEL LIKE I'M IN AN
INTERESTING SPOT.

796
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,472
>> Jeff: HOW SO?

797
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:50,518
>> WHEN I LAST SAW MY LAIRO
FOLKS I WAS BLIND SIDED.

798
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:55,523
I GOT TO THE MERGE BY THE SKIM
OF MY TEETH WITH THE

799
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,900
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY VOTING FOR
ME, SO I'M LOOKING TO BUILD SOME

800
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,026
TRUST WITH SOME PEOPLE TONIGHT.

801
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,822
>> Jeff: DAN, WHAT IS IT ABOUT
TONIGHT'S VOTE THAT IS SO

802
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:03,990
IMPORTANT?

803
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,910
>> IT'S ABOUT THE MOMENT YOU
EITHER CAN TRUST OR NOT TRUST

804
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,663
YOUR OWN ABILITY TO JUDGE
PEOPLE.

805
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,498
THAT HAPPENS TONIGHT.

806
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,584
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT MAKES THIS
SO TERRIFYING.

807
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,671
YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO BE PROVEN
REALLY WRONG OR REALLY RIGHT,

808
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,548
BUT YOU WON'T KNOW UNTIL THE
NAMES ARE READ.

809
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,632
THEN YOU CAN BEGIN TO PLAY.

810
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,094
>> Jeff: MISSY, REALLY
INTERESTING COMMENT, WHICH IS

811
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,889
TONIGHT IS ABOUT KNOWING IF YOU
ARE ON POINT, IF YOUR INSTINCTS

812
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,974
ARE RIGHT.

813
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,602
>> TONIGHT IS A BIG GUILT CHECK
I THINK FOR ALL OF US.

814
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,440
TONIGHT IS DID YOU APPLY FOR A
REASON AND ARE YOU GOOD AT THIS

815
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,899
GAME.

816
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,234
>> Jeff: WOW.

817
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,737
CAN'T SAY IT ANY MORE SIMPLY.

818
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,573
IF YOU DON'T SURVIVE TONIGHT,
YOU'RE NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS YOU

819
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,073
HOPED.

820
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,742
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

821
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:52,496
NOURA, YOU'RE UP.

822
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:10,931
>> CAN'T WAIT TO NOT BE LIVING
WITH YOU.

823
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,144
>> ONLY TWO WAYS TO SPELL
BLINDSIDE TONIGHT, AND THE OTHER

824
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,771
WAY IS D-A-N.

825
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,900
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE.

826
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,137
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

827
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,494
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

828
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:25,714
WANT THE PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

829
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,383
OKAY.

830
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,678
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

831
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,516
FIRST VOTE, DAN.

832
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,854
KELLEE.

833
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,565
DAN.

834
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,024
KELLEE.

835
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:44,733
WE'RE TIED.

836
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,695
TWO VOTES DAN, TWO VOTES KELLEE.

837
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,699
DAN.

838
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,533
KELLEE.

839
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:57,037
THREE VOTES DAN, THREE VOTES
KELLEE.

840
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,876
DAN.

841
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,626
TIED AGAIN.

842
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,837
FOUR VOTES DAN, FOUR VOTES
KELLEE.

843
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,507
>> OH, MY GOD.

844
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,175
>> Jeff: DAN.

845
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,719
THAT'S FIVE VOTES DAN.

846
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,469
TIED AGAIN.

847
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:20,728
FIVE VOTES DAN, FIVE VOTES
KELLEE.

848
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,604
KELLEE.

849
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:28,027
THAT'S SIX VOTES KELLEE, FIVE
VOTES DAN.

850
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,197
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

851
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,822
KELLEE.

852
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,574
THAT'S SEVEN, THAT'S ENOUGH.

853
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:44,752
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

854
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:54,136
>> HE'S SHAKING HIS HEAD.

855
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,640
>> Jeff: KELLEE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

856
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:07,441
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

857
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:10,277
>> Jeff: WELL, AS MUCH AS YOU
WANT THE BELIEVE IN TRUST,

858
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,571
ALWAYS GOT TO WORRY ABOUT
DECEPTION.

859
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,240
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

860
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:14,615
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

861
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:20,788
GOOD NIGHT.

862
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:25,584
>> I'M HONESTLY KIND OF IN
SHOCK.

863
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,419
I AM MY WORST ENEMY IN THIS
GAME.

864
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,005
FINDING TWO IDOLS IS GREAT, BUT
IF YOU FIND TWO IDOLS AN YOU

865
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,759
DON'T KNOW HOW THE USE THEM, YOU
MIGHT AS WELL NOT FIND THEM.

866
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:38,430
I LET THE PEOPLE I TRUST LULL ME
INTO SECURITY, AN I SHOULD HAVE

867
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:44,103
OBVIOUSLY POLICE DEPARTMENT AN
IDOL.

868
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,188
-- PLAYED AN IDOL.

869
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,780
>> WHEN I SAW THE VOTES COMING
DOWN AT TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR

870
00:42:54,863 --> 00:43:02,663
KELLEE, I WAS LIKE, HOLY CRAP,
WHAT HAPPENED?

871
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:07,001
MY MIND JUST WAS RACING, BECAUSE
THIS WAS A VOTE NOT BASED ON THE

872
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:11,046
GAME SO MUCH AS BASED ON
STANDING UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT.

873
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,174
>> I GUESS NOBODY'S TALKING,
HUH?

874
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,843
>> OKAY.

875
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,470
ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO TALK?

876
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:18,804
OKAY.

877
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,640
I GOT IT.

878
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,476
MY INFORMATION I WAS GIVEN FROM
ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS, THEY SAID

879
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,897
THEY FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN
DAN'S PRESENCE, SO I FELT VERY

880
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,234
BETRAYED ON A MORAL LEVEL.

881
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,114
BECAUSE I WAS WILLING TO
JEOPARDIZE MY GAME BECAUSE THESE

882
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,367
GIRLS WERE IN SUCH A PANIC FROM
WHAT I UNDERSTOOD.

883
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,163
>> I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE
FEELING.

884
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:44,788
WE CAME BACK PISSED OFF.

885
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,875
>> THIS IS MORE THAN A VOTE.

886
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,208
OKAY.

887
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,335
>> JANET.

888
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:54,256
I'M SORRY THAT THIS IS ALL
HAPPENING, BUT I DO NOT FEEL

889
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,009
COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THAT
THINGS WERE COMING TO LIGHT.

890
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,594
>> SO YOU VOTED KELLEE?

891
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,013
>> I'M GOING TO BE HONEST, I
VOTED KELLEE.

892
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:01,889
>> SO WHO ELSE?

893
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,224
YOU WENT KELLEE, TOO?

894
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,018
>> YEAH.

895
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,229
>> I WAS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING
FOR ALL YOU GIRLS.

896
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,982
THIS WASN'T EVEN MY --
>> AND I APPRECIATE THAT FROM

897
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,233
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

898
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:17,196
I JUST DON'T KNOW THEY WAS READY
TO DEAL WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON,

899
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,741
AND I'M WOMAN ENOUGH TO SAY THAT
>> OKAY.

900
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,285
VOTING DAN OUT FOR THE REASONS
THAT PEOPLE WANT TO VOTE HIM

901
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,579
OUT, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH.

902
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:30,042
AND I AM NOT GOING TO SAY ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER WHO IS

903
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,752
COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT OR WHAT
HAPPENED TO WHOM.

904
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:37,299
ALL I KNOW IS MY STORY AND WHAT
DAN AND I EXPERIENCE, SO FOR ME

905
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,509
IT WASN'T AN ISSUE.

906
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,302
AND THIS IS A GAME AT THE END OF
THE DAY.

907
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,888
I HOPE KELLEE DOESN'T TAKE IT
PERSONAL.

908
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,974
SO THAT'S WHAT IT IS FOR ME.

909
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,436
>> WE HAVE TO HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.

910
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,148
>> OKAY.

911
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:57,861
>> ELIZABETH, LAURAN, MISSY ALL
CAME TO ME CRYING AND FREAKING

912
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,824
OUT ABOUT HOW INAPPROPRIATE YOU
HAVE BEEN AND THANK GOD I'M

913
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,117
BACK.

914
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,159
>> OKAY.

915
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,787
>> I WONDER IF THAT WAS A GAME
>> NEW YORK IT WASN'T.

916
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,666
>> BECAUSE PEOPLE COME TO ME ALL
THE TIME TO CRACK MY BACK.

917
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,793
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS ODD, BUT
THEY ALL CAME TO ME SAYING THIS.

918
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,754
THE TALK TODAY WAS ABOUT YOU.

919
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,422
>> OKAY.

920
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,631
YEAH.

921
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:22,970
>> AND I DON'T THINK THE GAME,
BECAUSE THEY VOICED IT TO THE

922
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,138
POWERS THAT BE.

923
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:28,142
THEY WERE ALL HAPPY I WAS HERE
BECAUSE YOU SEEMED, THEY SAID,

924
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,979
THEIR WORDS, MORE CALM THAT I AM
HERE.

925
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,939
>> OKAY.

926
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,607
>> I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

927
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,944
>> IT'S THE MOST ABSURD
ACCUSATION.

928
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,362
>> EVERY ONE OF THEM MADE IT.

929
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,989
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU HAD AN
EMPLOYEE COME TO YOU.

930
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,031
>> OH, MY GOD.

931
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:43,949
I'VE HAD IT.

932
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,827
WE'VE IMMEDIATELY FIRED PEOPLE
>> EXACTLY.

933
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,372
I HAVE BEEN IN THAT POSITION
WHERE EMPLOYEES HAVE COME TO ME.

934
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,665
I UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES OF IT.

935
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:56,170
>> I HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS, HAD
EMPLOYEES, HAD CLIENT, HAD

936
00:45:56,253 --> 00:46:01,008
AUTHORITY FOR 20 SOMETHING
YEARS, AND I HAVE NEVER HAD EVEN

937
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,969
THE FAINTEST HINT OF IT EVER IN
MY LIFE.

938
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:08,015
SO IT'S DEPRESSING THAT
ANYONE -- IT'S DEPRESSING THAT

939
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:12,519
SOMEONE WOULD FEEL IT EVEN
AUTHENTICALLY FOR A MOMENT.

940
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,730
THEY SEEM AS TIGHT WITH ME AS I
HAVE EVER FELT.

941
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,189
>> OKAY.

942
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,523
THEN I GOT PLAYED.

943
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,150
THEY SENT ME ACROSS THE LINE.

944
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,026
>> WOW.

945
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,028
>> AND THEY PLAYED ME ON YOUR
REPUTATION.

946
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,031
>> THAT'S NOT WHO I AM, BUT I
CAN'T EVER BE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S

947
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,282
HEART.

948
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:29,870
IF THEY DON'T EXPRESS IT TO YOU
ENOUGH, YOU BEHAVE THE WAY YOU

949
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:36,877
THINK YOU'RE BEHAVING BECAUSE IT
SEEMS RIGHT TO YOU.

950
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,961
>> WHAT'S UP?

951
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,548
>> JANET TOLL ME SOMETHING THAT
RIPS MY SOUL IN HALF.

952
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:47,179
IF IT'S EVEN TRUE OR EVER WAS
TRUE FOR A NANOSECOND, BIGGEST

953
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:52,684
THING I CAN THINK OF IS DEEPLY
APOLOGIZING, BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME

954
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,896
THAT THERE WAS EVER A THOUGHT
THAT I'VE EVER COME NEAR YOU IN

955
00:46:55,979 --> 00:47:05,405
A WAY THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE OR
ODD OR WRONG, I CAN'T FATHOM IT.

956
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,907
I'M, YOU KNOW, I'M...

957
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,954
>> DAN, THE ONLY THING THAT WE
CAN SAY TO THAT IS IF WE TRULY,

958
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:17,084
TRULY FELT THAT, DID WE NOT HAVE
THE POWER TO VOTE YOU OUT

959
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,627
TONIGHT?C
>> OF COURSE YOU DID.

960
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,920
THAT'S WHAT I SAID TO JANET.

961
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,090
SHE SAID, NO, MISSY AND
ELIZABETH RAN IT UP THE

962
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:23,423
FLAGPOLE.

963
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,132
>> SORRY.

964
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,176
>> I APPRECIATE YOUR --
>> NO.

965
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,387
>> THIS RUINS MY LIFE.

966
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,430
>> WE SLEPT NEXT TO YOU EVERY
NIGHT.

967
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,392
IN THE BUNGALOW, WE DON'T WANT
TO SLEEP ANYWHERE ELSE.

968
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,769
WE DON'T WANT TO SLEEP ANYWHERE
ELSE.

969
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:36,728
JANET LITERALLY...

970
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,565
>> JANET TOLD ME YOU TWO CAME TO
HER CRYING.

971
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,066
>> WHAT?

972
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,778
MY VIEWPOINT IS I HAVE NEVER
FELT UNCOMFORTABLE, AND I KNOW

973
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:45,988
WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

974
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:50,117
BUT IT'S MORE IN A JOKING WAY,
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE ON

975
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,579
THE WRONG PART OF IT, BECAUSE WE
SHOULDN'T BE JOKING ABOUT THAT.

976
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:59,251
BUT NOBODY HAS COME TO ME WITH
LEGITIMATE LIFE CONCERNS.

977
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:03,088
IT WAS LITTLE BABY SNIPPETS HERE
AND THERE THAT SNOWBALLED INTO

978
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,966
SOMETHING WAY BIGGER THAN IT
EVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

979
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:13,265
>> IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
TAKEN AND MISCONSTRUED, BUT IT'S

980
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,474
NOT --
>> CORRECT.

981
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,852
BUT TO ME IT'S SO REPREHENSIBLE
THAT SHE WOULD USE THAT AS A

982
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:17,311
TOOL IN THIS GAME.

983
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,979
>> SHE'S A SNAKE.

984
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,441
>> I THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.

985
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,151
BECAUSE --
>> WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE A

986
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,319
CONVERSATION WITH HER TOMORROW.

987
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,156
>> SHE ACTED TO ME -- YOU'RE
GOING THE LOSE YOUR MIND, LIKE

988
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,367
SHE'S DISGUSTED WITH YOU ALL FOR
PLAYING HER THAT WAY.

989
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,621
>> I APPRECIATE WHAT JANET DID
BECAUSE SHE WAS BEING THE

990
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,833
MOTHERLY FIGURE THAT SHE IS, BUT
FOR ME PERSONALLY, I NEVER FELT

991
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,960
UNSAFE AND IT WAS NEVER SERIOUS
TO ME.

992
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,379
IT WAS ALWAYS GAME PLAY TO ME.

993
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:48,550
AND MY VOTE WAS BASED ON THE
GAME OF "SURVIVOR" AND THE FACT

994
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,219
THAT I WAS GOING WITH THE
NUMBERS AND THAT NAME HAPPENED

995
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,679
TO BE KELLEE.

996
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,055
>> DAN, WE ARE GOOD.

997
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:57,851
>> THANK YOU.

998
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,353
>> DAN, WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD.

999
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,314
>> DAN, THEY'RE GOING THE TRY TO
FIND CRACKS.

1000
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:05,025
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FIND A KINK
IN THIS ARMOR.

1001
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,319
>> I'M TRYING NOT TO.

1002
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,528
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1003
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:14,701
>> I'M ON A TRIBE OF 13 WHICH
WERE WOMEN, NOW EIGHT OF WHICH

1004
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,496
WERE WOMEN AND NOW SEVEN OF
WHICH ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE NEVER

1005
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,206
EXPERIENCED ANYTHING BUT COMFORT
AND STRENGTH AND HONESTY AND

1006
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,415
LOYALTY AND DECENCY.

1007
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:31,259
THAT VOTE PROVED THEY WANT TO
KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME WITH ME.

1008
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:38,266
THAT VOTE PROVED THEY WANT TO
KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME WITH ME.

1009
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,269
I THINK WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM
>> WHAT?

1010
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,229
>> WE HAVE REAL PROBLEM.

1011
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,730
>> WHAT?

1012
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,898
>> BEYOND THIS GAME.

1013
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:51,405
I WENT TO THEM AND SAID, AND
THEY SAID IT WAS A COMPLETE AND

1014
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,572
UTTER LIE.

1015
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,700
WE SLEPT IN THIS THING WITH YOU
EVERY NIGHT BY OUR CHOICE.

1016
00:49:54,783 --> 00:50:00,247
WE ASKED YOU -- WE COMPLETELY
ADORE YOU.

1017
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,250
>> I'LL GO TALK TO THEM RIGHT
NOW.

1018
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,251
>> I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT.

1019
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,085
>> WHY?

1020
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,129
I'M NOT LYING.

1021
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,132
>> AND LIZ IS THE ONE WHO SAID
HOW UNCOMFORTABLE SHE WAS, NOT

1022
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:10,841
MISSY.

1023
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,552
I WAS TOLD THAT FROM THE OTHERS.

1024
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,428
>> NO.

1025
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,932
JANET, LISTEN TO ME, DID SHE SAY
IT TO YOU?

1026
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,267
>> NO, MISSY.

1027
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:20,684
LIZ DID.

1028
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,601
>> TO YOUR FACE?

1029
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:21,935
>> YES.

1030
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,437
>> OKAY.

1031
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,397
LIZ SAID, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

1032
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,940
AND RIGHT UP THERE.

1033
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:30,944
>> OKAY.

1034
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:35,157
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
TO ME.

1035
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,787
>> MISSY, MISSY, ARE YOU IN
HERE?

1036
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,622
>> I AM, YES.

1037
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,290
CAN YOU COME OUT FOR A MINUTE
AND LIZ.

1038
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:48,336
>> ONE SECOND.

1039
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,254
>> IT'S BETTER WITH US ALONE.

1040
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:54,301
>> NEW YORK NO, IT'S NOT.

1041
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:59,681
LIZ, DID I NOT TALK TO YOU RIGHT
UP THERE ON THE CORNER AND SAID,

1042
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:03,810
YOU SAID HOW UNCOMFORTABLE YOU
ARE AND THANK GOD I WAS BACK?

1043
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:09,024
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT?

1044
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,819
AND HOW UNCOMFORTABLE YOU WERE
AND THANK GOD I WAS BACK?

1045
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,279
>> YEAH, I DID SAY THAT
>> OKAY.

1046
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,822
>> DAN, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

1047
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,824
>> UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ME?

1048
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,534
>> YEAH.

1049
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,328
>> IF THAT'S THE CASE, I...

1050
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,329
>> SHE SAID THAT.

1051
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,957
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO
TELL YOU.

1052
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:26,666
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN IN SHOCK.

1053
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,001
>> ARE WE OKAY?

1054
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:28,835
>> WE ARE FINE.

1055
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,336
>> OKAY.

1056
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,337
>> DAN, WE ARE FINE.

1057
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,171
>> OKAY.

1058
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:31,713
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

1059
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,172
>> BUT YOU DID SAY THAT?

1060
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,841
>> I DID.

1061
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,509
>> OKAY.

1062
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,554
>> OKAY.

1063
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,306
>> WE'LL TALK IN THE MORNING.

1064
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,974
THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT AND
SAYING THAT.

1065
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,184
>> NO, OF COURSE.

1066
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:48,855
>> DAN, I'LL GO AWAY.

1067
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,818
>> JUST KNOW THAT WE'RE FINE AND
THERE ARE SOME THINGS I NEEDED

1068
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,903
TO SAY THAT NEEDED TO BE SAID.

1069
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:55,237
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

1070
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,363
>> 100%.

1071
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,867
>> I AGREED WITH HER.

1072
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:06,623
>> I FEEL ANYTHING RELATED TO
SEXUAL UNCOMFORTABILITY HAS

1073
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:12,045
NOWHERE, NO PLACE IN A JOKING
ENVIRONMENT, IN A GAME

1074
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:12,712
ENVIRONMENT, IN ANYTHING.

1075
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,756
IT'S ITS OWN EASTBOUND "TKO."

1076
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,008
IT'S A VERY POWERFUL, POWERFUL
THING.

1077
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:17,926
LIVES CAN BE DESTROYED.

1078
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,344
LIVES CAN BE DESTROYED IF YOU'RE
ABUSED.

1079
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,222
LIVES CAN BE DESTROYED IF YOU'RE
FALSELY ACCUSED.

1080
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:26,226
LIVES ARE GOING TO BE DESTROYED,
AND IT'S TOO POWERFUL TO PLAY

1081
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,394
WITH.

1082
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:33,900
AND THE DEFENSIVENESS OF ALL THE
OTHER GIRLS DISGUSTS ME.

1083
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,444
THEY'RE EITHER LYING TO
THEMSELVES AND I CAN HAVE

1084
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,364
COMPASSION FOR THAT, OR THE
GIRLS LET I SLIDE THAT DAN WAS A

1085
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:44,327
PROBLEM, AND I'M UPSET ABOUT
THAT, BECAUSE HE WASN'T MY

1086
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,537
INITIAL VOTE.

1087
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,247
AND I CHANGED IT TO SUPPORT THEM
SO THEY COULD FEEL BETTER AT

1088
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,791
CAMP.

1089
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:53,920
THAT'S A DAMN SHAME.

1090
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:20,989
>> WHERE ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

1091
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:21,990
>> WE'RE GOING OUT.

1092
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,575
>> WALK, WALKING.

1093
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,453
>> I QUESTIONS MOST OF THE TRIBE
DID NOT KNOW WHERE I SPENT THE

1094
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:30,290
NIGHT, BECAUSE ALONG COMES MISSY
AND AARON WITH A SHOVEL AND A

1095
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,166
STICK.

1096
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,459
THEY'RE IDOL HUNTING, AND I NEED
THE IDOL.

1097
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:38,340
SO I FOLLOW THEM.

1098
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:42,177
THEY WALK DOWN THE BEACH, THEY
CUT INTO THE WOODS, AND I LOST

1099
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,428
THEM.

1100
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:50,602
BUT I WASN'T JUST GOING TO GIVE
UP.

1101
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,146
EVERYBODY IS TEARING THIS JUNGLE
APART.

1102
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:56,775
BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED THE IDOL
BECAUSE I'M THE NEXT VOTE AT THE

1103
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:07,869
NEXT TRIBAL.

1104
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,621
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I FOUND IT.

1105
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,039
IT'S AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1106
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:17,295
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

1107
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:17,671
"CONGRATULATIONS."

1108
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,129
THERE IT IS.

1109
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,005
THIS WILL SAVE ME.

1110
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,299
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHEN
TO USE IT.

1111
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,843
I GOT THIS BY NOT GIVING UP.

1112
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,347
I SAID, YOU NEED TO PICK
YOURSELF UP, AND YOU NEED TO

1113
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,516
JUST KEEP PUTTING ONE FOOT IN
FRONT OF THE OTHER, BECAUSE IF

1114
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,978
YOU DO, YOU CAN FIND AN IDOL.

1115
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,166
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING.

1116
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,210
>> WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

1117
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:00,046
>> SO ME AND JAMAL WERE LEFT OUT
OF THE VOTE, AND NOW WE SUDDENLY

1118
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,882
FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MINORITY.

1119
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,593
SO WE ARE DISCUSSING HOW WE CAN
GET OURSELVES OUT OF THIS

1120
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,013
POSITION.

1121
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:12,183
I THINK THERE MAY BE HOLES THAT
MAY COME UP.

1122
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,562
YOU NEVER KNOW.

1123
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,605
WHAT IS THAT?

1124
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,066
>> OH, MY GOD.

1125
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,446
SUDDENLY I SEE SOMETHING HANGING
FROM A TREE IN FRONT OF ME, AND

1126
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:30,035
I WANT TO GRAB IT MYSELF, BUT
JAMAL GOES AND GRABS IT BEFORE

1127
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,077
ME, AND IT'S A NOTE.

1128
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,912
>> DO NOT OPEN.

1129
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,916
BRING THIS WITH ME TO ISLAND OF
THE IDOLS.

1130
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,585
IF I DO THIS AND IT'S SOMETHING
GOOD, IT'S SOMETHING GOOD FOR

1131
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,669
BOTH OF US.

1132
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,381
I'M THINKING, WHY WOULD THERE
JUST BE A HANGING NOTE.

1133
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,091
THAT'S NEVER A THING.

1134
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,552
SO I'M 100% FLOORED.

1135
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,763
I FOUND A NOLT ON THE PATH.

1136
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,431
>> I'M SO HAPPY.

1137
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,099
>> I'M JUST CURIOUS.

1138
00:55:53,183 --> 00:56:04,444
I'M JUST WANTING TO KNOW WHAT IS
IN STORE FOR ME.

1139
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,321
THIS IS AWESOME.

1140
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:12,327
I COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED TO
BE HERE.

1141
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:16,331
I WAS LIKE JUMPING OUT OF MY
PANTS TO GET ON TO ISLAND OF THE

1142
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:22,670
IDOLS.

1143
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:32,680
LOOK AT THAT.

1144
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,640
>> WELL, HELLO.

1145
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,641
>> GET OUT OF HERE.

1146
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,642
>> COME BACK HERE.

1147
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,477
>> GET OUT OF HERE.

1148
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,480
>> COME ON, COME ON, WE'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

1149
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,607
>> WHAT?

1150
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,483
>> COME ON.

1151
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,820
>> HOW DID YOU POP OUT OF MY TV
SCREEN.

1152
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,614
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

1153
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,826
BOSTON ROB AND SANDRA, THEY
CREATED A BLUEPRINT FOR HOW TO

1154
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,077
PLAY THIS GAME.

1155
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,539
WHICH MAKES US ALL HAVE TO
EVOLVE THE GAME EVEN MORE,

1156
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,457
BECAUSE THEY WERE THE TREND
SETTERS.

1157
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,333
>> COME ON IN.

1158
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,627
>> SO YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HERE
FOR YEARS?

1159
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,256
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1160
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:10,718
SO HOW DID YOU END UP COMING
LIKE TO ISLAND OF THE IDOLS?

1161
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,680
>> SO I GO WALK WITH KARISHMA.

1162
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,848
SO WE'RE TALKING.

1163
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,058
AS WE WERE TALKING I SEE THE
SIGN, THE LITTLE NOTE HANGING

1164
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:20,895
FROM THE SEE THAT SAYS, YOU
FOUND ME, I'M YOURS.

1165
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,521
>> WHERE'S THE NOTE?

1166
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:26,192
>> IN MY POCKET.

1167
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:26,693
>> WHY DON'T YOU OPEN IT.

1168
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:33,700
>> ALL RIGHT.

1169
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,828
>> WHAT IS IT?

1170
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:40,540
>> READ IT LOUD AND READ IT
PROUD.

1171
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,543
>> YOU JUST LEARNED A TOUGH
SURVIVOR LESSON.

1172
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:48,006
THE MOMENT YOU GRABBED THIS NOTE
YOU LOST YOUR VOTE AT THE NEXT

1173
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,591
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1174
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:53,678
IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,
IT PROBABLY IS.

1175
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:58,349
I GOT GOT
>> YOU KNOW THERE ARE NO FREE

1176
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,392
LUNCHES ON "SURVIVOR."

1177
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:01,853
>> I'M LEARNING THAT
>> YOU HAVE TO LEARN EVERYTHING.

1178
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,771
>> YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT
>> EVERYBODY THAT COMES TO

1179
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:08,359
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

1180
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,611
YOUR LESSON IS IN THE ART OF
SABOTAGE.

1181
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,862
YOU OBVIOUSLY GOT BURNED.

1182
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:17,285
YOU LOST YOUR VOTE, AND THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

1183
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:21,372
BUT I WANT TO GIVE YAW CHANCE TO
TEST TO SEE HOW WELL YOU

1184
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,751
UNDERSTAND SABOTAGE.

1185
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,545
WOULD YOU LIKE THE TRY TO GET
SOMEONE OUT

1186
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,255
>> I WOULD LOVE TO TRY TO GET
SOMEONE OUT.

1187
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,632
>> WE HAVE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT
BE INTERESTED IN

1188
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,967
>> SAY MORE.

1189
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,262
>> SANDRA, GIVE THAT TO JAMAL.

1190
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,138
>> OPEN IT.

1191
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:46,773
>> OPEN THIS?

1192
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:50,109
IT IS BLANK
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

1193
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,613
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS
>> JAMAL, THIS IS OPPORTUNITY.

1194
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,530
>> OKAY.

1195
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,909
>> THIS CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT
IT TO BE.

1196
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,161
WHAT ELSE IS IN YOUR HAND?

1197
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,162
>> A PENCIL.

1198
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,790
>> HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE OF
THOSE ON "SURVIVOR."

1199
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,793
>> I HAVE NEVER SEEN A PENCIL.

1200
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:07,961
>> THERE'S A LOT OF POWER HERE.

1201
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,756
>> THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT YOU
CAN DO WITH THAT PIECE OF

1202
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:12,507
PARCHMENT.

1203
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,468
>> COME ON, JAMAL, START
THINKING.

1204
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:25,311
WHAT COULD YOU DO WITH THAT AND
THAT PENCIL?

1205
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,482
>> HEY, JAMAL.

1206
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:29,732
YAY!

1207
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,984
JAMAL.

1208
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:35,655
>> I WAS GIVE THEN OPPORTUNITY
TO USE THIS ART OF SABOTAGE IN A

1209
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,826
WAY TO GET SOMEONE OUT.

1210
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:44,872
SO I WROTE THIS FAKE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE, BUT THIS NOTE HAS NO

1211
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:45,873
POWER.

1212
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:50,295
SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK
UNLESS I SELL THIS.

1213
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,337
>> ALL RIGHT.

1214
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:51,713
STORY TIME.

1215
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:52,839
>> ALL RIGHT.

1216
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:53,798
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

1217
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,342
THE GAME THAT I HAVE TO PLAY WAS
REASONABLE.

1218
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:01,556
I RISKED MY VOTE TO PLAY 50/50
CHANCE.

1219
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,515
I WIN.

1220
01:00:02,598 --> 01:00:03,182
>> OKAY.

1221
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,143
>> SO WIN THE GAME.

1222
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,396
IT SAID, YOU GAIN CONTROL OF AN
ADVANTAGE.

1223
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:12,358
WHAT THEY MEANT WAS --
>> GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

1224
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,109
>> IT WASN'T FOR ME.

1225
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:18,698
I HAD TO GIVE IT TO SOMEONE
ELSE.

1226
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:25,038
SO IT'S ONLY FITTING BECAUSE IT
IS HIS BIRTHDAY, SO THIS

1227
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,999
ADVANTAGE IS GOING TO GO TO
DEAN, AND IT IS REALLY AN OLIVE

1228
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,542
BRANCH SO THIS IS FOR YOU.

1229
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:32,545
ALL RIGHT.

1230
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:33,379
>> HI, BIRTHDAY BOY.

1231
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,883
>> HELL OF A TARGET FOR MY
BIRTHDAY.

1232
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:42,889
>> MY MAN, JAMAL, SO ELOQUENTLY
EXTENDS ME AN OLIVE BRANCH IN

1233
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:43,639
FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

1234
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,600
>> DOES THAT SAY LEGACY
ADVANTAGE?

1235
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:46,225
>> GOOD JOB.

1236
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,393
>> YOU CAN BARELY READ IT.

1237
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,562
>> THAT'S MY HANDWRITING.

1238
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:53,191
IT WAS BLASTERED ON THESE WOODEN
BOARDS, AND I HAD A BLANK THING

1239
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:56,402
IN FRONT OF ME, SO I HAD TO COPY
IT DOWN TO TURN IT INTO A

1240
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:56,861
PHYSICAL THING.

1241
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:57,362
>> YOU MADE THAT?

1242
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,863
>> YOU MADE AN IDOL.

1243
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,365
>> YOU LITERALLY DID.

1244
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,240
>> I HAVE THE POWER.

1245
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,201
>> WHERE DID HE GET A PEN?

1246
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,411
WHERE DID HE GET A MARKER TO
WRITE IT?

1247
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,872
HE CERTAINLY FOUND A BIG OLD
PAINTBRUSH AND PUT A BIG OLD

1248
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,916
TARGET ON MY BACK BY DOING THAT.

1249
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,544
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD SAY
THANK YOU, BUT THANK YOU.

1250
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:13,920
>> ORR VERY WELCOME.

1251
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,546
>> MIND BLOWN.

1252
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,798
>> THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.

1253
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,800
>> AWESOME, THANK YOU, JAMAL.

1254
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,802
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TRYING
TO DO.

1255
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:24,305
>> IS THAT HIS HANDWRITING?

1256
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,640
>> HANDWRITING?

1257
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,725
>> YOU THINK IT COULD BE FAKE?

1258
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,059
>> NO.

1259
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:28,810
NO.

1260
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:32,271
IT FEELS TOO DETAILED TO BE
FAKE.

1261
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,817
>> THERE'S A THING, IF SOMEONE
HAS TOO MANY DETAILS, IT'S NOT

1262
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,110
TRUE.

1263
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:41,072
>> WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT, BUT
NOW, EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THIS

1264
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,950
TRIBE KNOWS THAT DEAN HAS GOT AN
ADVANTAGE BY JAMAL DOING THAT.

1265
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,286
THAT WASN'T AN OLIVE BRANCH.

1266
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,622
THAT WAS A DEATH THREAT.

1267
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:50,790
THIS GUY IS A THREAT.

1268
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,960
THAT'S WHY HE'S GOT TO GO.

1269
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:08,975
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1270
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,810
FIRST THINGS FIRST, AARON, GOT
TO TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY

1271
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,689
NECKLACE.

1272
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:20,445
THANK YOU.

1273
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,448
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

1274
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:27,660
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO HOLD ON THE HANDLE OVER

1275
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:28,870
WATER.

1276
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:32,665
AT REGULAR INTERVALS, I GET TO
LOWER YOU CLOSER TO THE WATER.

1277
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:35,877
WHEN THE PAIN BECOMES TOO MUCH,
YOU'LL FALL INTO THE WATER, AND

1278
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,837
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

1279
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:45,303
LAST WOMAN AND THE LAST MAN LEFT
STANDING WIN IMMUNITY.

1280
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:49,640
TWO PEOPLE WILL BE SAFE TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1281
01:02:49,724 --> 01:03:01,319
LET'S GET STARTED.

1282
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,404
ALL RIGHT
WE'RE READY TO BEGIN.

1283
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:09,911
EVERYBODY LEAN OUT NOW.

1284
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:11,454
EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD.

1285
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:16,000
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

1286
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:21,881
LET'S MAKE IT INTERESTING
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GAME.

1287
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,341
>> HOLY --.

1288
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,217
>> Jeff: HERE WE GO.

1289
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,094
DIG IN AND HANG OUT.

1290
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,391
>> OH, MY GOD.

1291
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,559
>> IT'S THE CLICK.

1292
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,060
IT'S THE CLICK.

1293
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,061
>> STOP, STOP, STOP.

1294
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,729
>> JEFF, JEFF, JEFF, JEFF.

1295
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:37,063
>> LAURAN, HANG IN.

1296
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,773
HANG IN.

1297
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:39,732
>> OKAY.

1298
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:42,068
STUDIO 1-A CALM.

1299
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,903
>> THERE WE GO.

1300
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,405
>> HE ENJOYS THIS WAY TOO MUCH.

1301
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,115
>> Jeff: YOU SURVIVED.

1302
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:52,119
YOU'LL BE HERE FOR FIVE MINUTES
AND WE'LL DO THAT AGAIN.

1303
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,080
EVERYBODY LOOKS GREAT.

1304
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,415
HANGING OUT OVER THE WATER.

1305
01:03:56,499 --> 01:04:00,419
>> JUST ANOTHER DAY IN FIJI.

1306
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,921
>> Jeff: THAT TENDENCY IS
GOING TO WANT TO --

1307
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,549
>> IT FEELS LIKE IT'S ROLLING.

1308
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:05,550
>> JUST STAY CALM.

1309
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,093
>> I'M OUT.

1310
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,594
>> LAURAN, YOU'RE GOOD.

1311
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,762
>> MINE'S ROLLING.

1312
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:10,179
I'M OUT.

1313
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:10,846
>> IT'S MOVING.

1314
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,598
>> YOUR ARM IS FALLING ASLEEP.

1315
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,891
>> STAY CALM.

1316
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:14,267
STAY CALM.

1317
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:14,642
>> YOU GOT IT.

1318
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:15,935
>> I'M OUT.

1319
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,105
>> LAURAN IS FIRST TO DROP.

1320
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,649
THAT'S HOW FAST IT CAN HAPPEN.

1321
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:22,441
>> NO.

1322
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:26,821
NO.

1323
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,115
>> Jeff: DAN SAYS, THAT'S
ENOUGH FOR ME.

1324
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,451
JUST LIKE THAT WE ARE DOWN TO
TEN LEFT.

1325
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:36,163
LAST WOMAN, LAST MAN LEFT
STANDING WIN IMMUNITY.

1326
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,999
>> COME ON.

1327
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:44,964
>> Jeff: YOU'RE ALL FIGHTING
TO STAY IN IT.

1328
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,173
>> COME ON.

1329
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:49,051
>> Jeff: JAMAL NEXT TO HIT THE
WATER.

1330
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,971
THE PAIN IS TOO MUCH.

1331
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:57,268
>> GOOD LORD.

1332
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,812
>> Jeff: ELAINE WITH A NICE
ENTRY.

1333
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:01,314
I'LL GIVE YOU A 7.6.

1334
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,150
DOWN THE FIVE WOMEN NOW, THREE
MEN.

1335
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,985
EVERYBODY LOOKING REALLY GOOD.

1336
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,446
LET'S CRANK IT UP AGAIN.

1337
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:08,988
HERE WE GO.

1338
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:18,831
DIG IN.

1339
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:21,667
[CRANKING]
NOW YOU'RE FEELING IT.

1340
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,046
>> AIN'T NO JOKE.

1341
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:28,215
>> Jeff: STAY HERE FOR FIVE
MORE MINUTES.

1342
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,176
NOW YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO BE
HANGING OUT OVER THAT WATER.

1343
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,219
I KNOW YOU'RE STRUGGLING.

1344
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,555
JUST KEEP FIGHTING.

1345
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,015
"SURVIVOR" IS A CRAZY,
UNPREDICTABLE GAME.

1346
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,684
YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU'RE SAFE OR
NOT.

1347
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:46,025
>> HANG IN THERE, GUYS,
LITERALLY.

1348
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,193
>> Jeff: KARISHMA CAN'T TAKE
IT ANYMORE.

1349
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:52,031
SHE DROPS.

1350
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:52,615
JANET DROPS.

1351
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,158
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE WOMEN.

1352
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:54,992
DEAN DROPS.

1353
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,870
WE'RE DOWN THE THREE WOMEN AND
TWO MEN.

1354
01:05:57,953 --> 01:06:01,582
YOU CAN FEEL THE MOMENTUM KICK
IN RIGHT NOW.

1355
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,209
THIS IS WHAT YOU HOPE FOR WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT PLAYING THIS

1356
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,502
GAME.

1357
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:08,214
A MOMENT LIKE THIS WHEN IT'S ON
YOU TO PROVE WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN

1358
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:08,798
THE TANK.

1359
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:15,012
>> LOOKING STRONG, NOURA.

1360
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:15,888
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1361
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:16,347
HERE WE GO.

1362
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,141
ANOTHER ROTATION.

1363
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:25,856
[CRANKING]
EVERYBODY FEELING IT NOW.

1364
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:30,736
DOWN AT THE END NOURA AND MISSY
LOOKING LOCKED IN.

1365
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,947
THEY HAVE NOT PROVED FOR A LONG
TIME.

1366
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:33,572
YOU GUYS ARE ALL DOING GREAT.

1367
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:38,703
>> GOOD JOBBING EVERYBODY.

1368
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,037
>> Jeff: DIG IN.

1369
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:40,579
ROTATION STARTING.

1370
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:44,709
>> STAY WITH IT, TOMMY.

1371
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:51,757
[CRANKING]
>> Jeff: ENJOY.

1372
01:06:51,841 --> 01:07:00,391
NOURA SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE
JUST DROPS.

1373
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:02,101
AND TOMMY DROPS.

1374
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,438
AARON WINS HIS SECOND INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.

1375
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:12,319
AND NOW WE HAVE MISSY AND
ELIZABETH BATTLING FOR IMMUNITY.

1376
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:17,074
DAY 24 OR SURVIVOR, SECURITY AT
TRIBAL.

1377
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,577
BOTH WOMEN FULLY EXTENDED.

1378
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,369
>> YOU LOOK GREAT, MISSY.

1379
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:24,165
>> THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT RIGHT
HERE.

1380
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:25,291
KEEP DIGGING.

1381
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,126
>> ELIZABETH, DON'T GIVE UP.

1382
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,002
>> FIND A SPOT.

1383
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:28,627
FIND A SPOT.

1384
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,172
>> Jeff: LICKS STRUGGLING.

1385
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,423
ELIZABETH CAN'T DO IT.

1386
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:34,425
ELIZABETH OUT.

1387
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:37,470
MISSY WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

1388
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,513
DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO GET WET.

1389
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:43,267
AARON AND MISSY SAFE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1390
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,685
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

1391
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,898
>> AS OF NOW JAMAL, JANET AND
KARISHMA ARE TARGETS.

1392
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,442
EACH NAME BENEFITS SOMEONE
ELSE'S GAME DIFFERENTLY.

1393
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:55,196
THE QUESTION IS, WHO DO YOU GET
OUT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW, WHAT

1394
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,406
TIME?

1395
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,007
>> CAN WE RECONNECT?

1396
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,509
>> OKAY.

1397
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,720
>> ALL RIGHT
I WANT THE CHANGE.

1398
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,514
>> OKAY.

1399
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,307
GO CHANGE AND I'LL MEET YOU ON
THE BEACH.

1400
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,517
>> ALL RIGHT.

1401
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,311
>> I'M VERY NERVOUS ABOUT TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT BECAUSE ME,

1402
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:29,271
KARISHMA, AND JANET ARE ON THE
BOTTOM.

1403
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:34,360
AND IF THE TRIBE IS SUSPICIOUS
OF ME COMING BACK FROM THE

1404
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,530
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS AND THINKING
I MAY HAVE LIED ABOUT WHAT I

1405
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,866
RECEIVED, THEY HIGH JUST PLAY
THE SAFE ROUTE AND I GO HOME

1406
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:41,659
TONIGHT.

1407
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,744
>> HOW AND WE GO FOR SMALL
STICKS.

1408
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:44,995
>> SMALL STICKS IT IS.

1409
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:49,208
>> THIS IS FIRST TRIBAL WHERE I
REALLY FEEL LIKE I'M IN DANGER

1410
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,125
OF GOING HOME.

1411
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,419
>> ISN'T IT AMAZING THIS IS
WHERE WE'RE AT?

1412
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,462
>> YEAH.

1413
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,422
>> NOURA AND KARISHMA COULD
STILL BE HERE OVER US.

1414
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,342
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT DESERVING
ANYMORE.

1415
01:08:58,425 --> 01:08:59,468
>> NO.

1416
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,387
IT'S JUST ABOUT HOW PEOPLE SEE
THEIR END GAME SHAPING UP.

1417
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,348
>> YEAH.

1418
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:05,558
I FIGURE IT'S A SPLIT VOTE.

1419
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,184
>> YEAH.

1420
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,352
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

1421
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:11,897
>> I REALLY WOULD RATHER NOT BE
ON THE LOSING END OF THAT.

1422
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,399
GIRLS ARE VOTING.

1423
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,568
>> YOU DON'T THINK HE GOT
ANYTHING?

1424
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:19,405
>> LET HIM PLAY IT.

1425
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,906
>> YOU'RE GOOD.

1426
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,076
YOU'RE GOOD.

1427
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:28,080
WE TELL KARISHMA TO GET HIM TO
PLAY IT.

1428
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:29,373
>> THIS IS LOCKED DOWN.

1429
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:30,583
>> IT'S DONE.

1430
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:34,420
>> WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT WHO
IS THE NEXT VOTE, KARISHMA,

1431
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,629
JANUARYET, OR JAMAL?

1432
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:39,383
WE DECIDED LET'S SPLIT THE VOTES
BETWEEN KARISHMA, BECAUSE THIS

1433
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:42,386
WHOLE TIM SHE'S BEEN ON THE
BOTTOM, AND JAMAL BECAUSE HE

1434
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:48,434
WENT TO THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS,
AND HE MIGHT HAVE AN IDOL.

1435
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,810
>> WHAT DO WE GOT?

1436
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:52,605
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1437
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:53,814
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

1438
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,441
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME LIKE I'M
SAFE.

1439
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,650
>> YOU ARE NOT GOING HOME.

1440
01:09:56,734 --> 01:10:02,114
>> TOMMY, THIS IS BETWEEN YOU
AND ME, YOU AND ME FROM THE GET

1441
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:02,948
GO
>> OF COURSE.

1442
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,909
>> MY NAME IS WRITTEN DOWN
TONIGHT.

1443
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,285
>> WHO SHOULD I VOTE FOR.

1444
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:06,702
DO I VOTE FOR JAMAL.

1445
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:07,620
>> YOU HAVE TO.

1446
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,456
>> I'M HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT
PLAYING MY IDOL.

1447
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,584
BECAUSE TOMMY IS TELLING ME I'M
OKAY.

1448
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:16,921
AND TO VOTE FOR JAMAL.

1449
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:20,341
>> I HAVE TO PUT MY TRUST IN
PEOPLE THAT WERE ANGRY WITH ME

1450
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:26,639
AND I MEAN, I AM NOW GONE FROM
THIS WONDERFUL LOVED PERSON TO

1451
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,641
THIS SCOURGE OF THE EARTH.

1452
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,684
SO I'M BRINGING MY IDOL.

1453
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,144
IT'S IN MY POCKET.

1454
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,145
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

1455
01:10:33,228 --> 01:10:43,155
I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IN EVERY
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1456
01:10:43,238 --> 01:10:48,160
I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IN EVERY
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1457
01:10:48,243 --> 01:11:00,381
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1458
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:04,677
SO NOURA, WHAT WAS THE REACTION
AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL?

1459
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,348
>> A LOT OF UPSET PEOPLE, A LOT
OF PEOPLE HAVING CONVERSATIONS

1460
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,307
RIGHT AWAY.

1461
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,352
I WAS SHOCKED KELLEE WENT, SO A
LOT GOING ON.

1462
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:19,483
>> Jeff: JANET, YOU WERE
SMILING DURING THAT.

1463
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:21,527
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF
MISCOMMUNICATION I GUESS.

1464
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:27,199
I THINK PEOPLE WERE DOING GAME
PLAY WHERE I PROVED INTO A

1465
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:29,326
DIFFERENT AREA.

1466
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:33,706
AND I MADE A DECISION BASED ON
MY MORAL CHARACTER.

1467
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,624
>> Jeff: AARON, WHAT AM I
MISSING?

1468
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,711
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY UNEVEN
FEELING.

1469
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,504
>> WHAT HAPPENED, THE EIGHT
PEOPLE THAT VOTED TOGETHER ALL

1470
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:42,673
PUT DOWN KELLEE'S NAME.

1471
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:47,344
THE FIVE PEOPLE THAT VOTED
TOGETHER, JANET, JAMAL, NOURA,

1472
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,013
KARISHMA, ALL PUT DOWN DIDN'T'S
NAME.

1473
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,180
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

1474
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:53,267
>> Jeff: SO JANUARYET, YOU
THOUGHT EVERYBODY WAS VOTING FOR

1475
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:53,726
DAN?

1476
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,227
>> I THOUGHT, YES.

1477
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:55,561
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT.

1478
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,396
>> OKAY.

1479
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,230
TIME OUT, THOUGH.

1480
01:11:58,313 --> 01:11:58,897
HOLD ON.

1481
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,899
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT TRUE, JANET.

1482
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,235
BEFORE THAT, WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN
FOR TRIBAL?

1483
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:06,655
>> ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME TO
SAY WHEN I BROUGHT YOUR NAME UP?

1484
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,073
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
SAY?

1485
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:08,615
>> YES.

1486
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,783
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1487
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:14,413
BUT I WAS TOLD CERTAIN THINGS
FROM MANY OF THE GIRLS, AND

1488
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,874
THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE VOTE.

1489
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:21,462
I THOUGHT AS A SOLUTION TO HELP
MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE TRIBE WHO

1490
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:27,259
EXPRESSED A CONCERN TO BE
RESOLVED AND CALMED DOWN, AND I

1491
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:32,056
THOUGHT ALL PARTIES INCLUDED IN
MY OPINION THAT WAS A GOOD MOVE,

1492
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:32,598
EVEN FOR DAN.

1493
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,309
>> BUT WE JUST MET YOU.

1494
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:35,851
SO WE DON'T KNOW.

1495
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,770
>> TOTALLY MY MISTAKE.

1496
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:40,689
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO MY OWN
GUT.

1497
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,818
I WAS WRONG FOR GETTING
INVOLVED.

1498
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:48,030
>> JEFF, I WANT TO MAKE IT
CLEAR, THIS WAS A "SURVIVOR"

1499
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,282
PLAY THAT WENT WRONG FOR JANET.

1500
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:52,242
>> I DISAGREE.

1501
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,746
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT --
>> I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT.

1502
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:56,997
A LOT
>> ALL RIGHT.

1503
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,750
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT
THE VICTIM ROLE IS BEING ASSUMED

1504
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:03,295
BY JANET, AND SHE'S NOW INSTEAD
OF TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR

1505
01:13:03,378 --> 01:13:05,672
BEING ON THE --
>> OH, MY GOD.

1506
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,967
>> SHE'S TRYING TO SPIN THIS
INTO SOMETHING THAT COULD AFFECT

1507
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,135
THE LIFE OF DAN.

1508
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,971
IF THIS WAS TRULY A GENERAL
TRIBAL CONCERN, I WOULD HAVE

1509
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:16,433
BEEN INVOLVED, TOMMY WOULD HAVE
BEEN INVOLVED, DEAN WOULD HAVE

1510
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,977
BEEN INVOLVED
>> NO, NO, THIS WHOLE IDEA IF

1511
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:22,523
THIS WAS ACTUALLY AN ISSUE THAT
I WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT, HE

1512
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:25,150
WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN

1513
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,443
THE REAL WORLD, GUYS.

1514
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,946
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN
THE REAL WORLD.

1515
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:33,283
WHEN A WOMAN BRINGS UP A CHARGE
AND PEOPLE WANT TO NEGATE

1516
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,619
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S LEGITIMATE,
THEY SAY, WELL, IF IT WAS SUCH A

1517
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:39,790
BIG ISSUE, THAN SHE WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT IT UP LAST YEAR, TWO

1518
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,500
YEARS AGO, THREE YEARS AGO.

1519
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,504
WE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO KNOW
THINGS JUST BECAUSE WE'RE MEN OR

1520
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,549
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE IN POWER.

1521
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:53,345
>> Jeff: AARON, JAMAL JUST
SAID SOMETHING REALLY POWERFUL.

1522
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,014
WHICH IS JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T
KNOW DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD

1523
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,141
HAVE BEEN TOLD.

1524
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,976
IT COULD BE SOMETHING VERY
PERSONAL THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T

1525
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:00,686
WANT TO SHARE AND STILL BE TRUE.

1526
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,564
>> IF THIS IS REAL WORLD, TAKE
"SURVIVOR" OUT OF THE QUESTION,

1527
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,356
100%.

1528
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:06,567
I HAVE TWO SISTERS, I HAVE A
MOTHER.

1529
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,987
MOST OF MY PERSONAL TRAINING
CLIENTS THAT I WORK WITH ARE

1530
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,113
FEMALE.

1531
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,698
I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THIS
ISSUE, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT AN

1532
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,535
ISSUE THAT IN THE REAL WORLD I
TAKE LIGHTLY.

1533
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:20,747
BUT THE ISSUE IS THE TWO WORLDS
ARE BEING MESHED TOGETHER, SO I

1534
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,667
HAVE TO LOOK AT DAN'S POSITION
AND SAY, IF THIS WAS BEING SAID

1535
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,587
ABOUT ME, I WOULD BE VERY UPSET
IF IT WASN'T TRUE.

1536
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,673
>> Jeff: SO, DAN, OBVIOUSLY
YOU'RE THE NAME THAT EVERYBODY

1537
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:31,508
IS TALKING ABOUT.

1538
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:35,095
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW?

1539
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:39,349
>> IS THE BOTTOM LINE WE'RE NOT
GOING TO LET THIS GO, AS MUCH

1540
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:45,606
AS -- HOLD ON, AS MUCH AS 12
PEOPLE ON THIS TRIBE RESPECT THE

1541
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:50,068
NON-GAME ASPECT OF IT AND THAT
IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE IT

1542
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,196
EVEN INFILTRATE IN THE GAME --.

1543
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,572
>> Jeff: DAN, BEFORE YOU GO
ON, HOLD ON.

1544
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,742
BEFORE YOU GO ON, LET ME PUT THE
CON TEK I'M LOOKING FOR, BECAUSE

1545
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,245
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE ONE I
THINK I'M LOOKING FOR.

1546
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,749
EVERYONE IS TALKING AROUND IT,
AND ALL THAT DOES IS CREATE MORE

1547
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,418
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT IS BEING
SAID.

1548
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:10,297
>> THE VOTE WAS HONESTLY ABOUT
TRUST AND DECEPTION.

1549
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,217
THE FACT THAT THINGS WERE USED
THAT I DON'T THINK SHOULD EVER

1550
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,802
BE USED IN THIS GAME, YOU KNOW,
IT'S UPSETTING.

1551
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:19,723
IT'S ALSO UPSETTING IF THERE WAS
EVEN HAIR OF TRUTH TO IT IN THE

1552
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:22,601
SMALLEST PART IN THE BEGINNING,
THAT'S BAD.

1553
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,728
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF
ANYTHING THAT EVER MAKES ANYBODY

1554
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:27,648
FEEL BAD.

1555
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:28,732
>> Jeff: KARISHMA, WHAT'S YOUR
TAKE ON THIS?

1556
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:34,029
>> WELL, PERCEPTION IS REALITY
IN THIS GAME.

1557
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:38,283
AND I DON'T THINK JANET IS
SPINNING SOMETHING TO BE

1558
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,787
DECEPTIVE OR CREATING SOME KIND
OF A STORY TO COVER HER BUTT.

1559
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,831
THIS WAS THE WAY SHE PERCEIVED
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1560
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:48,794
>> Jeff: JAMAL, PART OF THE
REASON THIS IS COMPLICATED IS

1561
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:52,673
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING
THROUGH SUCH A SEISMIC CULTURAL

1562
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:56,260
SHIFT IN HOW MEN AND WOMEN
RELATE TO EACH OTHER, HOW THE

1563
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,386
GENDER ROLES WORK.

1564
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:01,807
SO THERE IS A SENSITIVITY,
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE

1565
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:02,683
>> YEAH.

1566
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:03,809
YOU'RE RIGHT, JEFF.

1567
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,520
YOU CAN'T IGNORE THIS ISSUE.

1568
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,856
I THINK THIS ISSUE IS A LOT
BIGGER THAN THE GAME OF

1569
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:10,983
SURVIVOR.

1570
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,485
I'VE BEEN LISTENING VERY
CAREFULLY TO WHAT EVERYONE HAS

1571
01:16:13,568 --> 01:16:14,736
SAID.

1572
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,489
FROM MY POSITION WITH MY GENDER,
FAR BE IT FROM ME TO SPEAK FOR

1573
01:16:17,572 --> 01:16:18,699
WOMEN.

1574
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:24,579
WHAT I CAN DO AS A MAN, I CAN
GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF ADVICE AS

1575
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:28,125
TO HOW TO HEAR THESE STORIES
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

1576
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:30,919
HARASSMENT AND WHEN WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT DISCOMFORT, WHEN

1577
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:35,299
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MALE
ENTITLEMENT, IT BEHOOVES US ALL

1578
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:41,805
AS MEN TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND
LOOK AT OUR OWN BEHAVIOR AND

1579
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:45,809
IMAGINE THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA
THAT WHAT YOU WERE DOING WAS

1580
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:50,856
INAPPROPRIATE, WAS MAKING
SOMEONE UNCOMFORTABLE, AN YOU

1581
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:54,484
BELIEVE WOMEN IF THEY CHOOSE TO
BRING THAT UP, BECAUSE IT'S

1582
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,695
DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO DO THAT IN
AND OF ITSELF.

1583
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,906
>> WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO
HEAR WOMEN, LISTEN TO WOMEN, AND

1584
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:07,539
BELIEVE WOMEN WHEN THEY'RE READY
TO TELL THEIR STORIES.

1585
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:11,668
>> Jeff: DAN, LET'S JUST BE
CLEAR, WAS THERE A SPECIFIC

1586
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:15,422
MOMENT OR INCIDENT, OR IS THIS
JUST AN ACCUMULATION OF THINGS

1587
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:20,218
THAT HAVE BEEN SAID?

1588
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:24,848
>> OKAY.

1589
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:28,352
IT WON'T BE LET GO, CLEARLY.

1590
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:28,852
RIGHT?

1591
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:29,895
IT WON'T BE LET GO.

1592
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,564
>> Jeff: DAN, YOU'RE RIGHT, I
WILL NEVER LET IT GO.

1593
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:33,899
WE'LL BE HERE UNTIL DAY 39.

1594
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,984
SO JUST -- DAN, SLOW DOWN.

1595
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:40,238
>> NO, NO, NO.

1596
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,406
>> Jeff: GO AHEAD.

1597
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:47,579
>> FIRST OF ALL, I WORK IN THE
MOST HIGH-WIRE INDUSTRY IN

1598
01:17:47,662 --> 01:17:48,747
REGARD TO THIS BUSINESS.

1599
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,582
MOST OF MY CLIENTS ARE WOMEN.

1600
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:52,584
MOST OF THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH
ARE WOMEN.

1601
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:56,463
I WORK IN AN INDUSTRY IN WHICH
THE "ME TOO" MOVEMENT.

1602
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:59,966
WAS FORMED, IN WHICH IT WAS
ALLOWED THANK GOD TO BLOSSOM, IN

1603
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:06,264
WHICH IT WAS ALLOWED TOK BECOME
POWERFUL AND STRONG.

1604
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:13,563
MY PERSONAL FEELING IS IF ANYONE
EVER FELL FOR A SECOND

1605
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,900
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT ANYTHING I
HAVE EVER DONE, I'M HORRIFIED

1606
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:19,069
ABOUT THAT AND I'M TERRIBLY
SORRY.

1607
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:23,949
AND IF THAT PERSON WAS KELLEE,
IF KELLEE EVER FELT THAT IN THE

1608
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:28,912
FREEZING COLD RAIN OR IN TIGHT
SHELTERS OR IN WALKING AROUND IN

1609
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:32,332
SAYING, EGGS EXCUSE ME, I'M
COMING THROUGH OR IN ALL THE

1610
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:36,169
WAYS WE HAVE TO CRAWL OVER AND
AROUND AND THROUGH EACH OTHER IF

1611
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:40,632
THIS GAME I EVER DID ANYTHING
EVEN REMOTELY THAT MADE HER

1612
01:18:40,715 --> 01:18:44,469
UNCOMFORTABLE, IT HORRIFIES ME
AND I AM TERRIBLY SORRY.

1613
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,431
TRUE, UNTRUE, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I FEEL, IT DOESN'T MATTER

1614
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:48,306
WHETHER I'M AWARE OF IT.

1615
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,601
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I EVER
SENSED IT.

1616
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,521
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I KNEW
IT HAPPENED OR DIDN'T HAPPEN.

1617
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:56,314
IF SOMEONE FEELS IT, IT'S THEIR
TRUTH.

1618
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,983
I COULDN'T BE MORE SORRY.

1619
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:03,113
I COULDN'T BE MORE CONFIDENT IN
THAT I'M ONE OF THE KINDEST,

1620
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:03,822
GENTLEST PEOPLE I KNOW.

1621
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:04,531
I HAVE A WIFE.

1622
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:06,825
I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 21 YEARS.

1623
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:07,617
I HAVE TWO BOYS.

1624
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:09,161
I HAVE A BIG BUSINESS.

1625
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:10,829
I HAVE LOTS OF EMPLOYEES.

1626
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:14,332
SO I THINK WHAT UPSET EVERYBODY
HERE IS THAT IT HAS NOW TURNED

1627
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:18,837
INTO GAME PLAY.

1628
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,840
>> Jeff: JANET, HOW ARE YOU
FEELING RIGHT NOW?

1629
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:27,679
>> TRYING TO DECIDE IF I SHOULD
STAY.

1630
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:28,847
>> Jeff: IN THE GAME?

1631
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:32,976
>> ALL I WANTED TO DO IS PLAY
THIS GAME LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

1632
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:43,695
NEVER WOULD I HAVE WANTED TO
CREATE A PROBLEM WITH THIS

1633
01:19:43,778 --> 01:19:44,154
PLATFORM.

1634
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:44,571
I FEEL THE HATRED.

1635
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:46,198
I FEEL SO ALONE.

1636
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:46,865
>> I DON'T HATE YOU, JANET.

1637
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,826
>> JANET, NO ONE HATES YOU.

1638
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:50,535
NO ONE HATES YOU.

1639
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,370
>> NOT IN THE LEAST BIT, JANET.

1640
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,497
>> I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

1641
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,207
>> YOU SHOULD STAY.

1642
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,293
>> NOBODY COULD FEEL THAT FROM
THEIR HEART FOR YOU.

1643
01:19:58,376 --> 01:19:58,627
TRULY.

1644
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,044
SERIOUSLY.

1645
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,213
>> THANK YOU.

1646
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:02,214
>> Jeff: JANET.

1647
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,008
WOULDN'T IT BE A SHAME TO WALK
AWAY.

1648
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,344
THEY'VE ALL TOLD YOU, YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

1649
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:07,886
EVERYONE HERE HAS A POINT OF
VIEW.

1650
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,054
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT.

1651
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:10,055
WE'RE ADDRESSING IT.

1652
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,932
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

1653
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:12,933
>> OKAY.

1654
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:14,851
>> Jeff: NOW WE GO BACK INTO
THE GAME.

1655
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:17,729
THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO
COMPLICATED TO PLAY BUT SO

1656
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:18,063
COMPELLING TO BE PART OF.

1657
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,273
>> RIGHT.

1658
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,567
>> Jeff: SO ARE YOU?

1659
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:23,193
>> I'M IN.

1660
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:24,903
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1661
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,865
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN SUMMARIZE
WHAT WENT DOWN AND LET'S JUST BE

1662
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,075
REALLY CLEAR ABOUT IT.

1663
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,285
KELLEE SHARED A STORY WITH
JANET.

1664
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,204
YOU FELT LIKE YOU NEEDED TO TAKE
SOME ACTION.

1665
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:36,039
THAT BECAME ITS OWN STORY.

1666
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:37,749
YOU WERE BEING VERY RESPECTFUL.

1667
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,167
YOU WERE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT
THING.

1668
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,087
THEN IT GETS COMPLICATED BECAUSE
THERE IS STILL A VOTE THAT MAY

1669
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,090
OR MAY NOT BE IMPACTED BY THE
STORY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1670
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:48,552
BUT EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE IN
AGREEMENT, AND I NEED TO SAY

1671
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:53,139
THAT I AM, WHICH IS THAT YOU CAN
NEVER BRUSH OVER A STORY LIKE

1672
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,307
THAT.

1673
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,143
SO I THINK WHAT YOU GUYS ARE
TRYING TO SAY IS ALL OF THESE

1674
01:20:57,227 --> 01:21:00,855
THINGS CAN BE TRUE, JANET COULD
HAVE SEEN IT OR HEARD IT OR WAS

1675
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:03,275
TOLD IT AND WANTED TO TALK TO
SOME OF THE WOMEN AND NOT TELL

1676
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:07,779
THE MEN, AND JANET, IT'S ALSO
POSSIBLE THAT IT SEGUED INTO THE

1677
01:21:07,862 --> 01:21:09,990
GAME AND YOU DIDN'T REALIZE A
DIFFERENT THING WAS NOW BEING

1678
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:11,783
TALKED ABOUT.

1679
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:13,618
DOES THAT FEEL ACCURATE?

1680
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,661
>> YES.

1681
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:15,871
>> YES.

1682
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:18,498
>> Jeff: THEN THIS IS WHERE
"SURVIVOR" GETS SO COMPLICATED.

1683
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:22,335
YOU HAVE THIS REAL THING THAT
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE DEALING

1684
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:25,130
WITH FOR THE REST OF YOUR TIME
OUT HERE, AN YOU ALSO HAVE THIS

1685
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:29,634
OTHER THING, WRITING DOWN
SOMEBODY'S NAME ON THE

1686
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:30,802
PARCHMENT.

1687
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:33,638
LAURAN, THIS IS THE QUESTION
NOW: DOES THIS TRIBAL TONIGHT

1688
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,640
IMPACT THAT VOTE DO YOU THINK?

1689
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,934
OR ARE YOU GUYS ABLE TO SEPARATE
FROM THAT?

1690
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:41,187
>> YES, JEFF, I'M DEFINITELY
ABLE TO SEPARATE THE TWO.

1691
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,941
YOU KNOW, I THIS BELIEVE THAT
JANET IS SOMEONE THAT PEOPLE DO

1692
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,111
GO TO, AND THERE ARE SO MANY
PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO WATCH

1693
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:51,948
THIS AND APPRECIATE WHO YOU ARE
AND THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE

1694
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:54,826
DONE FOR WOMEN, AND PEOPLE THAT
DON'T HAVE A VOICE.

1695
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:58,204
AND THAT CAN'T SPEAK OUT AGAINST
ABUSERS AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE

1696
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,123
DONE THINGS TO THEM.

1697
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:04,169
SO I DIDN'T MEAN TO COME AT YOU
SO HARD.

1698
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:08,340
I WAS HURT, AND, YES, I JEFF, I
CAN SEPARATE THE GAME FROM WHAT

1699
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,051
NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE AND
ALL THAT STUFF.

1700
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:16,389
BECAUSE "SURVIVOR" DOES MIRROR
REAL LIFE AT POINTS IN TIME.

1701
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:20,143
SO WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

1702
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:22,562
>> Jeff: WELL SAID.

1703
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,522
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1704
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:32,072
NOURA, YOU'RE UP.

1705
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:11,903
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

1706
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,947
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1707
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:17,742
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1708
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:29,963
>> JEFF.

1709
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:30,380
THIS IS FOR ME.

1710
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:37,595
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1711
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,763
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1712
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,891
ANY VOTES CAST FOR JANET WILL
NOT COUNT.

1713
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:45,103
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1714
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,938
FIRST VOTE JANET.

1715
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:49,274
DOES NOT COUNT.

1716
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:49,983
JANET.

1717
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:53,945
DOES NOT COUNT.

KARISHMA.

1719
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:57,407
KARISHMA.

1720
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,785
TWO VOTES KARISHMA.

1721
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:01,411
KARISHMA.

1722
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:05,623
THAT'S THREE VOTES KARISHMA.

1723
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,040
JAMAL.

1724
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:09,419
ONE VOTE JAMAL.

1725
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,336
JAMAL.

1726
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:16,968
THAT'S THREE VOTES KARISHMA, TWO
VOTES JAMAL.

1727
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:17,844
WE'RE TIED.

1728
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:24,517
THREE VOTES KARISHMA, THREE
VOTES JAMAL.

1729
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:25,477
JAMAL.

1730
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,981
THAT'S FOUR VOTES JAMAL, THREE
VOTES KARISHMA.

1731
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:32,984
THE NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

1732
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:33,610
JAMAL.

1733
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:34,652
THAT'S FIVE,S THAT ENOUGH.

1734
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:45,622
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1735
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:53,004
JAMAL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1736
01:24:53,087 --> 01:25:02,347
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1737
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:06,309
WELL, ONCE AGAIN A LOT OF RAW
EMOTION, DIFFERENT OPINION, BIG

1738
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:10,688
IDEAS, AND AT THE END, ANOTHER
PERSON VOTED OUT.

1739
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:11,689
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1740
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:12,232
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1741
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:18,071
GOOD NIGHT.

1742
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:21,699
Captioning funded by CBS

1743
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,121
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

1744
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,039

>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1745
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:29,123
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1746
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:35,547
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," WHEN THERE IS A

1747
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,716
TWIST OF FATE, THERE WILL BE TWO
PEOPLE GOING HOME.

1748
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,343
THE GAME IS ON.

1749
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:41,886
>> KARISHMA AND JANET.

1750
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,222
>> IT COULD BE THE PERFECT STORM
TO GET TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.

1751
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:45,431
>> AND THE TBLOFS COME OFF.

1752
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:48,351
>> SHE WANTED TO VOTE YOU OUT
>> WHEN YOU BRING UP MY NAME,

1753
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:50,728
I'M COMING AFTER YOU.

1754
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,188
>> OH, MY GOD.

1755
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:55,650
>> THIS WILL HAVE ALL BEEN A
WASTE OF TIME IF ANYBODY COMES

1756
01:25:55,733 --> 01:25:59,779
OUT HERE AND DOESN'T LOOK FOR
WAYS TO GROW AS A PERSON.

1757
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:03,491
AND AS MUCH AS YOU PUT INTO THE
GAME, THE GAME IS WILLING TO

1758
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,368
REFLECT THAT BACK TO YOU AND
GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE A

1759
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:07,412
BETTER VERSION OF YOURSELF.

1760
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:11,291
SO I THINK I ACCOMPLISHED SOME
IMPORTANT STEPS IN MY OWN

1761
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:13,501
PERSONAL GROWTH OUT HERE.
