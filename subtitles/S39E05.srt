231
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,958
THE SAD THING IS SHE HAD BEEN ON
PUZZLE, HE HAD TRIED DOING THE

232
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,127
PHYSICAL ROLE AND HASN'T BB ABLE
TO DO ANYTHING.

233
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,212
SO WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR
US.

>> OH MY GOD, THIS IS SO GOOD.

249
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,934
>> APPLEBY'S I LOVE YOU.

250
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,560
THE FAJITAS WAS AMAZING.

251
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,021
MY MOUTH WAS WATERING, IT WAS
UNBELIEVABLE.

252
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,566
SO IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST
MOMENTS AND SOMETHING I WILL

253
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,694
NEVER FORGET FOR THE REST OF MY
LIFE.

254
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,613
>> OH MY GOD.

255
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,283
>> WE ARE A NEW TRIBE, A NEW
FAMILY, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

256
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,913

MAKING THIS MEAL FOR US

257
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,582
TOGETHER.

258
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,792
>> APPLEBEE'S.

259
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,754
>> THE DANGERS TO A 4-4 SPLIT T
IS EVEN HARD TO PUT INTO WORDS

260
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,757
BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH DANGER
AND THERE IS SO MUCH THAT COULD

261
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,008
POTENTIALLY HAPPEN.

262
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,427
FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD HAVE A TIE
WITH TRIBAL COUNCIL AND THERE IS

263
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,640
A CHANCE THAT WE HAVE TO DRAW
ROCKS TO SEE WHO GOES HOME.

264
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,394
SO WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK OF A
WAY TO GET ONE OF THESE NEW

265
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:17,606
VOKAI MEMBERS OVER WITH US.

266
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,148
>> I LIKE WIN THE NECK THREE.

267
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,316

269
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,949
PHASE, PRETTY SOON THAT MAY FADE

270
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,200
SEE.

271
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,120
>> MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, YOU KNOW
WHAT IT TASTES LIKE, IT TASTES

272
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,788
LOOK A W, BRO.

273
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,623

274
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,458
>> LAYERA CAN GO TO BED.

275
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,128
>> MY TRIBE, THEY IMMEDIATELY
WERE CHITCHATTING AND CUTTING UP

276
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,754
WITH THE VOKAI PEOPLE.

277
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,840
I DON'T LIKE THAT, BECAUSE YOU
DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE, THEY

278
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,551
COULD BE LYING THROUGH YOUR
TEETH, YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM, SO

279
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,135
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO STAY FOUR
STRONG.

280
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:51,515
>> I LOVE YOU APPLEBEE'S.

281
00:14:51,599 --> 00:15:04,153

00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,243
>> WE TRIED BAMBOO AT FIRST.

286
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,831
>> THE SMOKE COMES THROUGH HERE
SO IT KEEPS ALL THE BUGS AWAY.

287
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:18,584
>> HI BEEN REALLY HATING MY
TRIBE FOR A LONG TIME.

288
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,503
THEY ESSENTIALLY BULLIED ME,
REFUSED TO WORK WITH ME.

289
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,299
AND WROTE MY NAME DOWN AT TWO
TRIBAL COUNCILS IN A ROW.

290
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,634
>> I LOVE THIS.

291
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:31,013
>> ON TOP OF THAT, I JUST SHOWED
MY ENTIRE NEW TRIBE HOW WEAK I

292
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,849
AM IN CHALLENGES PHYSICALLY.

293
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,683

00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,019
I HAVE ONE CHOICE TO STAY ALIVE.

296
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:41,190
I HAVE ONE CHOICE TO KEEP
BREATHING AND THAT IS TO FLIP ON

297
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,359
OLD LAYERA.

298
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,863

>> KARISHMA IS THE ONE, I FEEL
BAD, AND I THINK ABOUT IT NOW, I

313
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,612
SHOULD HAVE STEPPED UP NOW AND
SAID SHE JUST CAN'T DO IT.

OH MY GOD, THAT IS LIKE SO
CRAZY.

340
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,591
>> THAT IS THE DRAMA WE WERE
MISSING OUT ON.

00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,385
>> DEAN AND I REALLY-- AFTER OUR
CONVERSATION I WAS LIKE THIS

00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,262
SOUNDS LIKE A GUY I COULD WORK
WITH.

343
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:39,308
BUT KARISHMA WANTS TO FLIP, I
THINK SHE'S WITH US.

ARE YOU NOT LIKE BOUND TO THE
ALTAR BUT IT IS ALSO NOT LIKE

348
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:08,337
YOU ARE GIVEN COMPLETE FREEDOM.

349
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,171
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.

350
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,131
>> WERE YOUR PARENTS ARRANGED.

351
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,009

WEEKS BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED.

352
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,177
>> WOW.

353
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,845
>> I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT MY
NEW FAMILY IT SIN CREDIBLE TO

354
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,181
OPEN UP AND BE VULNERABLE AT
THAT LEVEL AND TO TALK ABOUT MY

355
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,390
MARRIAGE.

356
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,353
>> I GOT MARRIED BECAUSE MY
PARENTS WANTED ME TO GET MARRIED

357
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:29,858
BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED TO.

358
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:34,196
>> MY PARENTS, THE DAY BEFORE I

00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,032
MARRIED, I SPENT TEN QUEERS
BEING TOLD I'M A BURDEN AND

360
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,700
SHAME TO MY FAMILY.

361
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,745
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T AGREE TO GET
MARRIED.

362
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,580
I GAVE IN.

363
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,082
SO HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT THIS.

364
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,083
>> NO, I.

365
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,167

>> I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR FOUR
AND A HALF YEARS BUT I HAVE BEEN

369
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,465
QUESTIONING MY LIFE CHOICES.

370
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,219
AND I REALLY, REALLY NEED TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS NEXT

371

>> I NEED TO LIKE SHARE MY
FEELINGS WITH MY HUSBAND.

373
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:07,354
I DON'T THINK I ALWAYS TELL HIM
HOW I AM DOING.

374
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,857
I QUEENED OF HIDE BEHIND A
SMILE.

375
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,693
AND FOUR YEARS LATER WE ARE LIKE
ROOMMATES.

376
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:17,239
>> YOU KNOW, HAVE I HAD REALLY
MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH

377
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,073
THE VOKAI MEMBERS.

00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,075
I CAN RELATE TO THEM MORE.

379
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:24,204
THEY MAY UNDERSTAND ME ON A
LEVEL THAT OLD LAIRO JUST COULD

380
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,081
NOT UNDERSTAND ME.

381
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:29,042
>> I'M SORRY.

382
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,545
>> WE'RE GLAD YOU ARE IN OUR
TRIBE.

I AM MOVING OVER.

386
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,515
-- LET'S GO.

387
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,559
>> OH, WE HAVE A THROWDOWN.

>> WE'RE FUN RIGHT.

394
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,288
>> ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET A
HOLD OF IT.

395
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,915
>> ELAINE IS DOING WHAT SHE
DOES.

396
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,293
SHE'S DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB AT
THE SOCIAL GAME.

397
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,171
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU
ARE GOING TO WIN THIS GAME IS TO

00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:21,345

VOKAI WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THAT
STREAK.

TOMMY'S SHORT, CAN DEAN WIN IT
RIGHT HERE?

528
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,920
NO, SHORT.

529
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,839
>> TOMMY CAN WIN IT FOR VOKAI.

530
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:17,510
AND HE DOES!

531
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,888
VOKAI WINS AGAIN.

532
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:24,726
SENDING LAIRO BACK TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL FOR THE FOURTH TIME THIS

533
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,268
SEASON.

534
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,187
WITH A BRAND NEW TRIBE.

535
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:33,902
WHO KNOWS WHO IS GOING TO HAPPEN
IN TRIBAL.

536
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:38,865
VOOK AYE, ONCE AGAIN IMMUNE SIT
ALL YOURS.

537
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:44,204
NOBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT, AND
NOBODY GOING TO ISLAND OF THE

538
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,246
IDENTIFYOL.

539
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:52,754
>> GRAB YOUR STUFF, SWIM OUT,
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

540
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,090
>> ALL RIGHT, LAIRO, TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT, SOMEBODY WILL

541
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:55,924
BE THE FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT.

542
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,259
SWIM OUT.

543
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,222
HEAD BACK TO CAMP, A UNITED
TRIBAL.

544
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,390
>> THANKS, JEFF.

545
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,059
>> TOM, KARISHMA AND DEAN, I
FEEL LIKE I'VE CONNECTED WITH

546
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,103
THEM ALL VERY, VERY WELL.

547
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,107
BUT KARISHMA DID NOT DO HERSELF
ANY FAVORS.

548
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,900
SHE HAS AN ABILITY TO PERFORM A
CHALLENGE.

549
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,985
I'M READY FOR A W IN ORANGE.

550
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:40,093
WE WERE ONE AWAY, ONE BASKET
AWAY.

551
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,096
>> I APPRECIATE EVERYONE SENDING
ME POSITIVE VIBES.

552
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,181
BUT THE FACT IS I DIDN'T MAKE IT
HAPPEN SO.

553
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:45,849
>> BUT YOU STEPPED UP.

554
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,226
IT IS WITH IT IS.

555
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,145
I AM GOING TO GO ON A WOOD RUN.

556
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,106
>> I'M A DIVISION 1 BASKETBALL
PLAYER, THAT WAS MY MOMENT AND I

557
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:57,110
BLEW TMENT I CAN'T BELIEVE TOW
THAT LONG, PALE, REDHEAD GOOF

558
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:04,117
BALL LOOKING GUY, SO ADD TO IT,
ME, TOM AND KARISHMA ARE REALLY

559
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,166
AT THEIR WHIM STRKS UP TO ME TO
MAKE THE BEST IN LAIRO Y MOT ME.

560
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,460
>> SHOULD WE PUT OURSELVES IN
THEIR SHOES.

561
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,463
>> TO BE HONEST YOU ARE PROBABLY
SAFE BECAUSE ST EITHER LET'S GET

562
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:21,176
A THREAT OUT, ME OR LET'S CUT
THE FAT, KARISHMA.

563
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,427
>> WHAT CAN WE DO.

564
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,889
>> I AM THINKING WE HAVE TO-- WE
ARE KIND OF LIMITED WHAT WE CAN

565
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,182
DO.

566
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,391
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SEND ONE OF
THEIR PEOPLE HOME T WILL BE ONE

567
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,728
OF US THREE THAT WILL GO HOME
TONIGHT BUT WHAT I AM ENCOURAGED

568
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,147
BY IS THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE
ANY MORE CHALLENGES AND THAT

569
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,194
REALLY POINTS THE FINGER AT
KARISHMA.

570
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,571
>> TALKING ABOUT EASING YOUR
MIND.

571
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,864
>> EASING YOUR MIND.

572
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,742
>> THERE ARE GUYS THAT PROBABLY
WANT TO WIN, WILL IS ONE WAY TO

573
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,242
DO THAT.

574
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,494
>> IT IS SO CLEAR.

575
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:51,414
>> YEAH, EVERY CHALLENGE IT IS
GOING TO BE HOW TO MINIMIZE THE

576
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,833
DAMAGE SHE CAN DO TO OUR ABILITY
TO WIN.

577
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,084
>> I KNOW.

578
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,837
>> WILL IS NOT MUCH KARISHMA CAN
DO AT THIS POINT TO MAKE A GOOD

579
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,090
CASE FOR HERSELF IN ANY
CHALLENGE CAPACITY.

580
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:05,345
WE ALL SEE IT WE'VE BEEN SEEING
IT ALL GAME LONG.

581
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:05,887
SHE SAY LIABILITY.

582
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,055
>> I DON'T HAVE
LAIRO.

583
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,390
I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS.

584
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:14,062
I WANT-- I AM NOT AN ATHLETE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM NOT.

585
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:14,646
I AM JUST NOT.

586
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,439
I KNOW MY OWN WEAKNESS.

587
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,734
>> IF WE VOTE OUT KARISHMA, THEN
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IN

588
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:22,570
THE NEXT FEW CHALLENGES HOW TO
MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE THATxD SHE C

589
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,448
CAUSE BY THE PHYSICAL
LIMITATIONS THAT SHE HAS.

590
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,324
NOTHING MEAN ABOUT THAT.

591
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,742
IT IS JUST A REALITY.

592
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:31,246
>> I'M GOING TO WAIT UNTIL YOU
GUYS TELL ME WHICH ONE TO WRITE

593
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,081
AND I WILL WRITE IT.

594
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,542
>> I WILL GO BACK THIS WAY.

595
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,253
>> CONSIDERING HOW I WAS VIEWED
AS WEAK IN THE CHALLENGE, IT IS

596
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,130
DEFINITELY NOT CRAZY TO ASSUME
THAT THE TRIBE WANTS TO LET GO

597
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,340
OF ME.

598
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,094
SO I'M OUT HERE NOW WITH THE OLD
VOKAI PLAYING UP THE SOCIAL

599
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,096
GAME.

600
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,098
>> SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
EVERYTHING?

601
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:55,019
>> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I GUESS YOU
GUYS HAVE TO DECIDE IF YOU WANT

602
00:30:55,103 --> 00:31:00,441
A STRONGER, TRY TO WIN
CHALLENGES OR GET TO MERGE WITH

603
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,484
SOMEBODY WEAKER THERE.

604
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,571
>> TOM IS OLD SCHOOL MAN.

605
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,948
>> VERY TYPICAL OF MEN OF THAT
AGE.

606
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,409
>> I WANT TO WIN, FIRST OF ALL,
I WANT TO GO THE TO MERGE WITH

607
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,618
YOU TOO.

608
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,079
>> HE CAN JUST GOING TO SAY IT
THE WAY ST, THERE IS GOING TO BE

609
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,623
NO HIDDEN AGENDAS WITH HIM,
WHICH I APPRECIATE.

610
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:20,670
HE, HOWEVER, HAS MORE OF A
TRIBAL MENTALITY AND I BELIEVE

611
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:24,966
IF WE GOT TO A MERGE I WOULD
LOSE HIM TO HIS OLD TRIBE.

612
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:29,637
>> YOU THINK IT'S CAR SHALL
THAT-- KARISHMA'S NIGHT.

613
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,805
>> I THINK SO.

614
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,975
>> HE IS A TERRIBLE-- SHE SAY
TERRIBLE CHALLENGE PERSON.

615
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,184
>> I AGREE.

616
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,937
>> I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU BUT
LIKE I DON'T WANT TO BECOME THE

617
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:38,605
NEXT CHELSEA.

618
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,648
>> THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

619
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,775
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE
CUDDLING.

620
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,028
>> I REALLY LIKE-- I WANT TO
WORK WITH HIM, BUT THERE IS

621
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,865
SOMETHING ABOUT DEAN THAT MAKES
YOU WANT TO WORK WITH HIM, THAT

622
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,158
MAKES YOU WANT TO TRUST HIM.

623
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:54,287
BUT ALSO THAT MAKES ME VERY,
VERY WARY OF DEAN AND MAKES HIM

624
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,413
A HUGE THREAT IN THIS GAME.

625
00:31:55,496 --> 00:32:00,835
SO DEAN IS NOT THE RIGHT PERSON
TO BRING INTO THE MERGE.

626
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:06,674
>> SO I HAVE BEEN GETTING A
LOT OF INFORMATION FROM DEAN,

627
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,509
AND-- TOM IS ALREADY WITH ME.

628
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,761
>> I CAN SEE THAT.

629
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,680
>> DEAN IS KIND OF ALREADY WITH
ME AND KARISHMA WANTS TO WORK

630
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,598
WITH US FOR SURE.

631
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,516
>> SO WHO WOULD BE THE FIRST
VOTE OUT THEN.

632
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,517
>> I DON'T KNOW.

633
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,769
>> TONIGHT IS SOME WHAT SIMPLE.

634
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,648
THE ONLY MONKEY WRINCH IN THERE
IS WHEN I GO TO THE ISLAND OF

635
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,067
THE IDOLS I LOST MY VOTE FOR
TONIGHT.

636
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,068
>> I WANT SOME REAL FOOD.

637
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,195
>> SO THAT PUTS US 4-3.

638
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,240
BUT THANK GOD WE STILL HAVE THE
NUMBERS.

639
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,244
I FEEL SO LUCKY AND EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T HAVE A VOTE, I STILL

640
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,290
HAVE A SAY, I AM STILL ANALYZING
THE GAME, LIKE WHAT WOULD BE THE

641
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,252
BEST FOR MY GAME, OUR GAME, SOME
PEOPLE ARE THINKING KARISHMA

642
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,505
BECAUSE SHE'S WEAKER.

643
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:51,552
DEAN IS A PHYSICAL THREAT AND
TOM IS A LIKABLE GUY, BUT HE'S

644
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,262
NOT AS PHYSICAL A THREAT AS I
THOUGHT.

645
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,765
SO NOW YOU HAVE THESE THREE
PEOPLE.

646
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,308
DO WE GO WITH THE WEAKEST
PERSON, OR DO WE DO BETTER IN

647
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:01,229
WINNING AS A TRIBE OR JUST GET
RID OF THE THREATS NOW SO WHEN

648
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,231
WE GO TO THE MERGE WE DON'T HAVE
TO DEAL WITH THEM THEN.

649
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,025
I AM REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT IT.

650
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,110
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BEST
DECISION FOR THIS VOTE.

651
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,487
>> ALL RIGHT, SO WE DO A TRIBE
SWAP, VOKAI HAS THE NUMBERS,

652
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,739
5-3.

653
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,283
SO IT WOULD SEEM LIKE FROM A BIG
PICTURE THAT EITHER THE VOKAI

654
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:59,287
GROUP STAYS STRONG OR LAIRO FIND
A CRACK.

655
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,789
TOM, WHAT WERE THOSE EARLY
MOMENTS LIKE WITH VOKAI, WHAT

656
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,124
DID YOU FEEL?

657
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,294
>> WELL, THE VOKAI TRIBE, ALL
FIVE OF THEM ARE FANTASTIC AND

658
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,338
OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT
THINGS MOVING FORWARD.

659
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,426
I DO NOT SENSE THAT WE FOUND A
CRACK THOUGH RIGHT NOW.

660
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,678
>> I'VE BEEN THERE.

661
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,182
>> JACK, DID YOU SEE THE LAIRO
THREE DOING THEIR BEST TO FIND

662
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,309
OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

663
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,561
>> YEAH, AND I THINK EVERYONE IS
OPEN TO A CONVERSATION.

664
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:27,815
WHETHER THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE
MY MIND, I DON'T KNOW.

665
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,526
>> KARISHMA, IT IS LIKE THEY ARE
THE ONES THAT HAVE THE JOB

666
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,195
OPENING AND THEY ARE JUST
SITTING BACK, I DON'T KNOW, TELL

667
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,489
ME ABOUT YOURSELF, MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

668
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,408
>> YEAH, IT'S LIKE COME ON IN,
LET ME KNOW HOW YOU CAN HELP ME

669
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,994
AND I WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT IS
GOOD ENOUGH, YOU KNOW.

670
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,288
AT THE ENDS OF THE DAY, THE NAME
OF THE GAME WHEN ARE YOU IN THE

671
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,291
MINORITY IS SELF-PRESERVATION.

672
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:49,837
>> SO JANET T IS NOT JUST PICK
ONE, THERE HAS TO BE A PURPOSE

673
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,298
BEHIND THE VOTE WHAT IS YOUR
CRITERIA.

674
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:56,177
>> FOR ME WE NEED TO WIN IN
ORDER TO AVOID SITTING HERE WITH

675
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,011
YOU.

676
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,304
AND TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO BE
STRONG.

677
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,849
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WIN.

678
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,394
>> NOURA, NOT ONLY DO YOU NOW
HAVE A CHANCE TO WORK WITH THREE

679
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,313
OF THE LAIRO.

680
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,523
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

681
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,358
>> BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU SEE
THE REAL TURN AND YOU SEE LIKE

682
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,194
THE WAY I'M INTERRUPTING OVER
HERE.

683
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,989
>> WHAT WAS HAPPENING, YOU WERE
CHURNING, WHAT?

684
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,033
>> I DON'T WANT TO MISS YOUR
QUESTION.

685
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:19,367
>> NO, I GOT MORE.

686
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,244
>> OKAY.

687
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,955
BUT YOU KNOW, IT IS TRUE WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT CHALLENGES ARE

688
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,375
COMING UP, BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE
MORE WELL-ROUNDED THAN OTHERS.

689
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,671
SOME PEOPLE ARE PHYSICAL AND
YOUNG AND GREAT AT PUZZLES AND

690
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,839
SHOOTING.

691
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,382
SOME PEOPLE ARE MAYBE OLDER AND
THEY CAN PULL THEIR WEIGHT

692
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,177
AROUND CAMP AND STUFF BUT THEY
DON'T HAVE THE ENDURANCE AND ARE

693
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,848
NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES AND THEY
DON'T LIKE THE WATER AND THAT

694
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,974
MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

695
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,394
>> TBOW COMES THE FUN PART,
KARISHMA, WHO IS SHE TALKING

696
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,229
ABOUT, WHO IS FUN, GOOD AT PUZZ
ELEVATORS.

697
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,397
>> ME.

698
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,901
>> WHO IS OLDER, MAYBE GOODS
AROUND CAMP BUT NOT SO GOOD AT

699
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,236
PUZZLES AND CHALLENGES.

700
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,112
>> TOM.

701
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,905
>> WHO IS SHE SAYING IS OLD,
FIRST OF ALL.

702
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,242
>> I'M 36, I'M OLD RELATIVE TO
ALL OF THESE 20 YEAR OLD

703
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,910
SOMETHINGS SO IT IS ALL
RELATIVE.

704
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,203
>> I KNOW.

705
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,414
>> AND KARISHMA, NOURA ONLY
MENTIONED THE TWO GUYS, DOES

706
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,958
THAT BODE WELL FOR YOU?

707
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,544
>> WELL, HER DESCRIPTION SEEMED
TO FIT THOSE TWO GUYS BUT I

708
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:15,882
COULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN SWEPT TO
THE SIDE AND JUST BE AN

709
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,675
AFTERTHOUGHT AND NOT EVEN WORTH
CONSIDERING.

710
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,928
>> TOM F IT IS
SELF-PRESERVATION, HAVE YOU EVER

711
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,931
HAD TO PLEA TO BE KEPT IN A
GROUP EVER?

712
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,975
>> NO, I THINK YOU SHOW PEOPLE
WHO YOU ARE.

713
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:29,228
YOU HAVE TO QUAREE YOURSELF A
CERTAIN WAY, IF YOU HAVE

714
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,230
CHARACTER, YOU HAVE TO HAVE
LEADERSHIP, YOU HAVE TO SAY

715
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,440
THERE IS WHO I AM.

716
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,692
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE EITHER YOU
WANT ME AS PART OF YOUR GROUP OR

717
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,943
NOT.

718
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,405
>> JANET, THE COMPLENLT TOM MADE
AND I SAY THIS NOW WITH RESPECT

719
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,992
THAT ONLY ARCH OLDER PERSON
COULD SAY IN THAT IT IS A VERY

720
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:43,743
CONFIDENT COMMENT.

721
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,786
>> I DON'T THINK ST AN AGE
THING.

722
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,997
FOR ME I AM JUST WHO I AM.

723
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,498
AND TORM IS JUST WHO HE IS.

724
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,585
HE IS A STRAIGHT SHOOTING GUY.

725
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,295
AND YOU KNOW, I RESPECT THAT.

726
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,589
>> DEAN, HOW ABOUT FOR YOU.

727
00:36:56,672 --> 00:37:00,176
IS THIS A POSITION YOU ARE
FAMILIAR WITH OR UNFAMILIAR

728
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:04,430
HAVING TO SORT OF PITCH YOURSELF
AND SAY HEY, YOU SHOULD WANT ME.

729
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,642
>> YES, YOU HAVE A PRODUCT, AND
YOU WANT SOMEONE ELSE TO USE IT.

730
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,810
AND TO MARKET IT TO THEM.

731
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,356
SO I AM PITCHING MYSELF TO BE
THE SIXTH MEMBER OF THE BAND BUT

732
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,192
ALSO PITCHING MYSELF FIVE
DIFFERENT TIMES TO SAY HEY,

733
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:16,817
THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN GAME.

734
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,946
CAN I BE BENEFICIAL TO YOU.

735
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,991
>> I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU SPOKE
WITH ME, AND MADE A CONNECTION

736
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:24,533
WITH ME.

737
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,826
I MEAN I KNOW TOM DID.

738
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,161
I KNOW KARISHMA DID.

739
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:29,705
I DON'T KNOW DEAN, WHEN WE DID
THAT.

740
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,541
>> I DON'T REALLY PULL KARISHMA,
AT OUR OLD CAMP, SHE WAS LAKE

741
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,503
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A
WALK, DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR A

742
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:40,675
WALK, LIKE EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL,
A ONE-ON-ONE FORGED

743
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,385
CONVERSATIONS FEELS AWKWARD TO
ME.

744
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,636
>> BUT YOU DID THAT WITH THE
OTHER GUYS.

745
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,514
>> I WOULDN'T SAY EXPLICITSLY
HEY, JAMAL LET'S GO FOR A WALK.

746
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,518
>> BUT YOU MADE TIME TO DO THAT,
THAT IS ALL I AM SAYING.

747
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,645
>> OKAY, NOT GOING TO ARGUE.

748
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,521
>> JAMAL WHAT IS YOUR CRITERIA?

749
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:58,192
>> MY NUMBER ONE
CRITERIA-- CRITERIA IS

750
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,277
CONNECTION TO THE OTHER SIDE.

751
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,946
IS IT A POSITIVE THAT ONE OF
THESE PLAYERS HAS STRONG

752
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,072
CONNECTIONS TO THE OTHER SIDE.

753
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:06,701
OR IS IT MORE OF ARCH-- AN
ADVANTAGE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

754
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,370
CONNECTIONS TO THE OTHER SIDE SO
THEY WILL STAY WHERE US COME

755
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,372
MERGE TIME.

756
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,499
>> DEAN, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
JAMAL'S ANSWER?

757
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,711
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS
RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE MORE OR

758
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,087
LESS LOYAL.

759
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,757
>> PERSONALLY, JEFF, I VERY MUCH
THOUGHT IT WAS A UNANIMOUS

760
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,260
KARISHMA VOTE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, SOMEONE, I DON'T KNOW

761
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,471
WHO, BROUGHT KARISHMA IN,
FLIPPED THE ENTIRE TRIBE AND NOW

762
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,225
SOMEONE AND KARISHMA ARE VERY,
VERY LOYAL TOGETHER.

763
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:31,726
I'M OUTSIDE.

764
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,977
>> THERE YOU GO, DEAN.

765
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,730
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS, BUT
KARISHMA DOES OWE SOMEONE BIG

766
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,689
TIME.

767
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,940
>> AND I WILL SAY I DONE EVEN
KNOW WHO I OWE.

768
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,110
I GOT A WHISPER A MINUTE BEFORE
TRIBAL AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THIS

769
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,069
IS MY.

770
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,572
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE, THAT IS NOT
TRUE AT ALL.

771
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,489
>> THERE IS MY SAVING GRACE.

772
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,615
>> SHE KNOWS WHO IT IS.

773
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,286
>> TOM, I SWEAR TO GOD, I
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT KNOW WHO WAS

774
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,747
IN CHARGE OF THAT, I GOT THAT
WHISPER RIGHT BEFORE TRIBAL.

775
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,708
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHO WAS IN
CHARGE OF THAT.

776
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,294
AND I DIDN'T CARE WHO IT WAS.

777
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,505
>> KELLEEE INTERESTING, JUST
BEFORE THE VOTE AND THE TENSION

778
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,592
STARTS TO PERMEATE, AND SOMEONE
STARTS TO SAY A LITTLE MORE.

779
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,428
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE
IS ON THE BOTTOM WHAT THEIR REAL

780
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,554
TRUTH IS?

781
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:13,601
>> THERE CAN BE MANY TRUTHS THAT
EXIST SIMULTANEOUSLY.

782
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,477
EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT
PERCEPTION.

783
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,770
EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT TRUTH.

784
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,440
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW AND AT THE
END OF THE DAY SURVIVOR IS ABOUT

785
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,609
TAKING LITTLE LEAPS OF FAITH AND
HOPING THE PEOPLE YOU PUT TRUST

786
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,611
IN ARE ACTUALLY TRUST WORTHY.

787
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,573
>> THAT IS MY GIRL.

788
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:37,625
>> ALL RIGHT T IS TIME TO VOTE,
TOM, YOU ARE UP.

789
00:39:37,708 --> 00:40:03,025
>> ALL RIGHT T IS TIME TO VOTE,
TOM, YOU ARE UP.

790
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:11,492
>> I WILL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

791
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:16,288
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

792
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:21,669
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

793
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,169
OKAY.

794
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,715
I WILL READ THE VOTES.

00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,818
GOOD LUCK.

815

>> BYE TOM.

816
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,951
>> THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WIN ANY
CHALLENGES NOW.

817
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,955
>> WELL, SOMETIMES THIS GAME
COMES DOWN TO SURVIVING JUST THE
