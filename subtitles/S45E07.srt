My relationship with Katurah
at this point in time

71
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,965
has been intense.
So the narrative that I'm trying

72
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,965
to push right now is, she didn't
want to vote for Kaleb.

73

All I'm doing is just
setting paranoia a little bit

that we experienced on Lulu.

-So I'm so excited.

as this kind of lone

159
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,206

with Kaleb, realize that if

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,275
I'm sticking my neck out
on the line for him too much,

161
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,758
then that shifts the target
from him onto me,

a two-way shared Steal a Vote

177
00:08:20,758 --> 00:08:23,517

that only I know,

178
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,517
and I guess maybe Drew,
but I don't even know

179
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,206

the pieces together yet--

180
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,689
Kaleb only stopped 11 votes,
instead of 12,

181
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,275
because I didn't vote for him.

182
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,102
Bummer. I'm not gonna vote.

183
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:38,068

I'm going to be sacrificing it

13 days for it to get there,

'Cause when you're quarterback
of the team,

now you're thinking
that the other ten guys

258

are going to be like,

what to do.

that you keep because...

maybe too literally.

perpetually out there,

00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:07,551
but Kaleb is on the outs.

272
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:11,482

I have Jake,

273
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,517

284
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:39,482

I have always played this game

of honesty.

00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,310
-I know, Bruce. I know.
-You know?

287
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:44,965
-And I'm just asking
simple questions.
-Yes, yes.

288
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,310
My main problem

289
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:48,034
right now is... [scoffs]

290
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:49,413
...is dealing with Bruce.

291
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,379
Like, I'm giving him
genuine advice,

292
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,620
and I'm having a hard time
kind of

293
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:56,275
getting through to him.

294
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,206
BRUCE:
There's never any malice
in the questions that I ask.

295
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,206
No, I don't think it's malice.
I think it's just low-keyness.

296
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,000
I think that's more
of what it is.

297
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,448
So, at some point,
it's a liability.

298
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,344
And I don't really know
what to do with him right now.

299
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,137
He has just been this,
like, anchor

300

this whole game.

301

KELLIE:
Bruce is just, like,
his way or the highway.

302
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:25,068
He keeps these vendettas
against people.

303
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,379
A vendetta against Katurah

304
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,482
that he cannot let go,
a vendetta

305
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,068
against Kaleb that he can't
let go, and it's like,

306
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:32,448
sometimes you need people
for the numbers, man.

307
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:35,517
I'm doing it with you right now.
Like, I like Bruce as a human,

308
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,000
but as a player, it is just...
it's so difficult.

309
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:42,344
What'd you guys talk about
this morning?

310
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,275
He was just saying
that people are noticing

311
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:47,000
that Katurah and Kendra
are too happy that Kaleb's here.

312
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:48,517
JAKE:
We can still use him as numbers.

313
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,000
So what are you thinking
right now?

314
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:51,344
I do think Bruce is gonna be

315
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:53,241
in the hot seat a little bit.

316
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,517
If he keeps acting like this,
like, it's gonna be a problem.

317
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,827
I know.

318
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:59,241
We have five original Belo,

319
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:01,448
and we need to come together,

320
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:02,793
and that's what
I'm trying to push.

321
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,275
I know.

322
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,413
And if we can get Bruce
on board,

323
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:10,034
I can get Kendra and Katurah.

324
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:12,379
I know, but old Reba--
they want to stick together,

325
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:15,137
and I see
the Reba-Belo war coming.

326
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:16,551
So,

327
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,862
I'm going
to need numbers in this game

to have numbers,

330
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:23,862
Kaleb's going to be one of 'em.

-[laughs]
-Bringing 'em back.

342
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:13,310
Everybody looks good merged.

343
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,655
-Yeah, right?
-Thank you.

344
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:15,965
Thank you.
Yeah, it feels good.

345
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:17,379
Orange is our color.

346
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:20,620
All right.

347
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:23,103
Shall we get to your first
individual immunity challenge?

348
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:24,931
-[all assenting]
-Hell yeah. Show it to us.

349
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,379
-Show us. Let's see it.
-Yes.

350
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,965
-You want to see it first?
-I would love to see it, yes.
-Yes, let's see it.

351
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,241
[gasping]

352
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:36,551
That is so beautiful.

353
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:38,034
PROBST:
There it is.

354
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,931
The individual
immunity necklace.

355
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,689
With this draped around you,
you are safe.

356
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:44,172
Here's how you earn it.

357
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:45,931
For today's challenge,

358
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:49,965
you're going to hold onto a pole
for as long as you can.

359
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,965
-JAKE: Yeah, baby.
-PROBST: When you drop,

360
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:54,275
you're out.

361
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:58,206
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

362
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,206
cannot be voted out
of this game.

363
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,206
There is a twist...

364
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,206
-Of course there is.
-Why not?

365
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,793
...to today's challenge.

366
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:09,482
You're going to be divided
into two groups of six.

367
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,344
The person who lasts the longest

368
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:15,586
for each group
earns individual immunity.

369
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,068
-KELLIE: Ah, ah...
-KALEB: Oh, snap.

370
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:18,241
Come on, Jeff.

371
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,000
KATURAH:
Hey!

372
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:23,034
-Two necklaces today.
-Yes. Yes.

373
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,551
Yes.

374
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:26,655
In addition,
you're playing for a reward.

375
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:29,275
-Want to know
what you're playing for?
-[all assenting]

376
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,310
The person who lasts the longest
out of everybody

377
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:35,103
earns for their group a visit
to the sanctuary,

378
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,172
-where good things happen.
-[gasping]

379
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,068
You'll enjoy an afternoon

380
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,965
of do-it-yourself tacos
and soft drinks.

381
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,758
KENDRA:
Oh, my God.

382
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:44,241
-BRUCE: Yeah!
-DREW: Oh, I need that.

383
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,620
Yeah.

384
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:47,862
I want tacos so bad.

385
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:52,517
And you earn the right
to go to Tribal Council second,

386
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,137
which matters because

387
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:56,758
both groups are going to go
to Tribal Council separately.

388
00:16:56,862 --> 00:17:00,103
-EMILY: Wow.
-Wow.

389
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:03,517
So tonight
two people will be safe,

390
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,655
two people will be going home.

391
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:09,413
What?

392
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:12,517
PROBST:
And at that first
Tribal Council,

393
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,378
the first person voted out...

394
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:17,068
will not make the jury.

395
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:20,172
-Oh, what?
-KALEB: Wow.

396
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:23,758
-Wow.
-PROBST: So, after 14 days,

397
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,758
not only will you not
win this game, you won't

398
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:27,068
have a say in who does.

399
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,862
Big enough stakes?

400
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,586
-[all assenting]
-All right,

401
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:33,344
we're going to draw for groups,
and we'll get started.

402
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:35,689
AUSTIN:
Wow. This is

403
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,620
absolutely brutal.

404
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,344
Here we go again.

405
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:41,379
KATURAH: The stakes are
super high. Whoever's getting

406
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:45,068
voted off at that first Tribal
Council doesn't make the jury.

407
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,206
It's like the dreaded position.
We all hate this position.

408
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,068
Your fate is determined
by drawing rocks.

409
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,655
Like, literally, you put
your hand in a bag of rocks

410
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,758
to figure out what group
we're going to be in.

411
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,172
It's terrifying.

412
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,172
-AUSTIN: This is it.
-PROBST: Moment of truth.

413
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:01,000
Everybody put your palms out.

414
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,413
Let's see what we got.
Everybody reveal.

415
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:16,137
Let's see what we got.
Everybody reveal.

416
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,896
And take your spot
on red or blue.

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,793
This is your competition
for today.

418
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:28,793
[Katurah laughs]

419
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,482
All right,
let's look at the groups.

420
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:35,275
Competing against each other
on red

421
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:38,689
will be Jake, Dee, Austin,

422
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:41,137
Julie, Kaleb, Katurah.

423
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:43,931
One of you's going
to win immunity.

424
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:47,448
The other group, wearing blue,
is gonna be Bruce, Sifu...

425
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,000
-Mm-hmm.
-...Kendra, Kellie,

426
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:52,310
Emily and Drew.

427
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:54,586
One of youwill be safe.
All right.

428
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:57,586
-We'll get it on. Let's do it.
-Yeah, baby. Let's go.

429
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:08,379
All right,
everybody's in position.

430
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,931
And this first
individual immunity challenge

431
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,827
of Survivor 45...

432
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:15,068
-Oh, my God.
-...is on.

433
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:19,379
Emily immediately starts
to slide down a little.

434
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:22,379
Various starting heights
for people, which is fine.

435
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:24,275
You can start at the top,
you can start

436
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:25,724
at the near bottom.
That doesn't matter.

437
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,344
You got a fear of heights?
Get rid of that.

438
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:30,586
Slide down.
All that matters

439
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,068
in this challenge is,

440
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,344
when your feet hit the sand,
you're out.

441
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:40,103
Emily's first out.
No shot at immunity.

442
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:42,724
Take a spot over here
on the bench with me.

443
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,448
Sorry, guys.

444
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,068
PROBST:
Julie going
to be first out for red.

445
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:49,586
Julie, take a spot on the bench.

446
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,000
We are down to five now
on each group.

447
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:56,000
Kendra starting to reposition.

448
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:58,379
-Those footholds are very small.
-Oh.

449
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,689
PROBST:
It is very difficult.

450
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:04,206
Your feet hurt, your body hurts.

451
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,689
Every time you slide down that
pole, it tears a little skin.

452
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:08,931
-[groans]
-EMILY: Come on, girl.

453
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:11,724
-Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Kendra's out.

454
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:15,068
Jake is out.
We're down to four on red.

455
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,379
KENDRA:
Looking good, red.

456
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,068
All you need
is for everybody else

457
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:20,793
to drop out before you.

458
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:22,206
That's it.

459
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,551
-[groans]
-And you want

460
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,103
to at least make sure
you make the jury.

461
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:29,275
-Drew, you look great.
-Thank you.
I know I'm a model up here.

462
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:31,413
-Bruce, you are solid.
-You're solid.

463
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,172
Bruce sliding down
to a different position.

464
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:39,413
That could be indicative of pain
or just strategy.

465
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,448
[groans]

466
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:45,448
Sifu now dropping.

467
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:47,827
-[groans]
-Sifu looks like
he's on his way out.

468
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:50,448
-Sifu drops. He's out.
-KENDRA: Good job, Sifu.

469
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:53,206
PROBST:
14 days of Survivor.No joke.

470
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,724
Bruce drops out, and we're down

471
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:56,551
to two on blue.
We have a showdown

472
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,448
with Kellie and Drew.

473
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:01,379
If I win, Jeff,
you got to help me come down.

474
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:02,931
[laughing]

475
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:05,103
JAKE:
You got it, Austin.
There's the ledge.

476
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:07,448
-That's the last ledge...
-Austin starts to slide down.

477
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:10,586
He's got his feet on that last
and lowest foothold.

478
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:13,413
Kaleb is down one section.

479
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:15,827
Katurah right where she started,
in the middle.

480
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:18,413
Dee still at the top.

481
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:20,620
JAKE:
Looking good, guys.

482
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:23,655
-[clapping]
-Oh, yeah, good.
-KENDRA: All of you.

483
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:26,551
One of the toughest challenges
we do on Survivor.

484
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,413
[Kaleb groans]

485
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:31,586
It hurts the minute you start.

486
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,344
[Austin groans]

487
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:37,275
Austin going to drop,
and we're down to three on red.

488
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,551
It is Dee, Katurah and Kaleb.

489
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:42,620
And it is Kellie and Drew
for blue.

490
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:44,103
My legs are numb.

491
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:45,862
PROBST:
Keep digging!

492
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,827
[indistinct,
overlapping chatter]

493
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,344
Hey, lock your legs, Drew!
Just lock 'em!

494
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:51,068
PROBST:
Drew starting to slide.

495
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:53,206
This is not looking good
for Drew.

496
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,965
He's going to have
to find another stable spot.

497
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:59,620
Kellie looks very comfortable
up top.

498
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:02,000
Dee looks very comfortable.

499
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,793
DREW:
Okay, I got to go down.

500
00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:06,206
I'm sorry,
my legs are going numb.

501
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,344
PROBST:
Drew is coming down.

502
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:09,965
Drew is out.

503
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:12,758
-Nice job, Kel, amazing!
-PROBST: Kellie, stay up there.

504
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:14,793
Kellie has won
individual immunity.

505
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,862
She cannot be voted out tonight.

506
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:19,413
KENDRA:
Our lives are in your hands,
Kellie.

507
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:21,827
You are now competing
for reward, Kellie.

508
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:23,655
-[indistinct chatter]
-Stay in there.

509
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:24,965
KENDRA:
You got this, baby.

510
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:27,034
I'm trying, guys,

-it feels like it takes
a little bit of, like...
-Yeah.

680
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,448
JULIE:
We're all voting Kaleb, right?

681
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:40,448
Like, that's all I'm thinking.

682
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:42,965
I'm a little worried because

683
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:45,310
all I'm thinking is,
"I'm not safe."

684
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:47,586
And what if
Kaleb is going, "Hmm.

685
00:29:47,689 --> 00:29:50,931
"If I can get Jake and Katurah,
maybe I can

686
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:52,896
split the votes,
maybe I got something"?

687
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,344
Because Kaleb doesn't stop.

688
00:29:54,448 --> 00:29:56,103
He isthe cat with nine lives.

689
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:58,137
I am just hoping

690
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,379
he doesn't find his ninth life
at my expense.

691
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:04,827
-I mean, that was insane.
-KATURAH: Crazy.

692
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,068
JULIE:
Craziest thing ever.

693
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:07,758
JAKE:
Dude, that was a clutch move.

694
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,103
I know everyone's like,

695
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,137
"Kaleb-- he played a good game.

696
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:14,551
He got lucky last night.
He has to leave."

697
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:15,620
But I'm like,

698
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:17,482
"I don't think so."

699
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:19,241
That would be bad
for my game right now.

700
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:21,241
I need him as a shield,

701
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:23,241
and I do want
to go deep with him.

702
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:24,275
We're halfway there.

703
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:25,896
Game starts today.

704
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,862
Now is the point where
you're trying to figure out,

705
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:31,000
what alliance am I going to be
in moving forward in this game?

706
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:32,517
And I think everyone's looking
for that right now.

707
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:35,344
-I know.
-She is.

708
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:37,206
JAKE:
People know who's tight
with who. We all see it.

709
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,344
I think Dee is
the biggest threat in this game,

710
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:42,103
but she's safe tonight.

711
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:43,482
Makes me cry for you.
I'm not even kidding.

712
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm, like, so proud.

713
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:46,241
JAKE: And I think
Julie's a weapon for her.

714
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,551
I want to disarm Dee, so

715
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:50,000
my target tonight is Julie.

716
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:56,724
-SIFU: Come here.
-KELLIE: I'm sorry.

717
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:59,172
-I tried really hard.
-[overlapping chatter]

718
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,137
You don't know how badly
I wanted those tacos.

719
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:02,758
I do know how badly.
I'm so proud of you.

720
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,275
[indistinct chatter]

721
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:06,275
SIFU:
You fought
with everything you had.

722
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:08,103
KELLIE:
I'm obviously thrilled I won.

723
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:11,379
Like, that's the best feeling
ever, but

724
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:14,172
because I wasn't able
to outlast Dee,

725
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:17,689
whoever goes home is going
to not make the jury.

726
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,068
-That was incredible.
-It was really good.

727
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,482
Really, really incredible.

728
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:22,413
I appreciate you guys
all saying that.

729
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:24,275
And it's really difficult

730
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:27,103
to think about
playing a part in...

731
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:29,551
in killing someone's dream.

732
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:35,862
So, my thoughts are
that I'm willing to go,

733
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:38,275
you know, any way with you.

734
00:31:47,517 --> 00:31:49,000
Uh...

735
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:54,275
DREW:
Honestly, my preference would be

736
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,965
to take out Bruce,
but Belo has the numbers.

737
00:31:58,068 --> 00:32:00,413
Bruce, Kendra and Kellie.

738
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:02,344
All of them are old Belo.

739
00:32:02,448 --> 00:32:06,655
I have Emily, who I do trust,
but she is on the outside.

740
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,896
And then, of course, you have
Sifu, who probably has an idol.

741
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,965
So if they want to target Reba,

742
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:14,344
I am screwed.

743
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:15,724
There would be a saving grace.

744
00:32:15,827 --> 00:32:17,482
I have
my Safety without Power,

745
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,793
and it would allow me
to just leave Tribal Council

746
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,482
before voting
and just be exempt.

747
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:23,517
There's only one problem.

748
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,896
I left my bag

749
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,448
back on Reba Beach,

750
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:29,206
so I have nothing.
I'm at Lulu.

751
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,103
I can't get to it.
I am out of luck. S.O.L.

752
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:35,206
So at this point,
my game plan has been reduced

753
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,551
to begging.

754
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,344
So, like, like,

755
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:40,034
100% honestly,
what are you thinking?

756
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:41,448
'Cause I'll go either way.
I don't care.

757
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:43,172
I just want to be
on the same page.

758
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,344
Okay.

759
00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:47,689
-KENDRA: Okay?
-DREW: All right.

760
00:32:47,793 --> 00:32:49,344
I will pull you in for that.

761
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:50,862
So, the way the tribes
are broken up,

762
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:53,724
I see this as my shot
to finally get Bruce out.

763
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:56,379
What is it?

764
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:58,655
Yeah, okay.

765
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:00,344
I was, like,
y'all were, like, hiding that

766
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:01,620
-like there was
gonna be some crazy thing.
-SIFU: Yeah.

767
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,000
-Well, it is a crazy thing.
-It is.

768
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:04,931
-You know what I mean?
-It is kind of, but...

769
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:06,206
Yeah.

770
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,068
DREW:
So the point is to keep it cool.

771
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:09,379
-Don't give him any sense of...
-Yeah, keep it cool.

772
00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:10,551
-DREW: Yeah.
-EMILY: Yeah.

773
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,896
KENDRA:
We have to be smart

774
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,137
about getting Bruce out,
because he's paranoid.

775
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,068
And that's really scary,

776
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:18,482
especially if Bruce feels
like he doesn't trust me.

777
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:19,965
If he plays an idol,

778
00:33:20,068 --> 00:33:22,448
it could be
one name written down,

779
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:23,724
and I could be going home.

780
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:25,655
All right,
what are your thoughts?

781
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:27,931
My thoughts.

782
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:30,137
My name is being
dropped right now by Kendra.

783
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,413
-KELLIE: You think so?
-BRUCE: Oh, yeah.

784
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:34,758
I don't think that's, like,
good for any of us,

785
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,413
-at this moment, you know
what I mean? Even for her.
-Yeah.

786
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:39,482
I know you guys have had
some sort of disagreements.

787
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:40,551
Yeah, well...

788
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,413
Or whatever, but...

789
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:45,068
BRUCE:
So right now,
if my inclination is correct,

790
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:46,724
Kendra wants me to go.

791
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:49,586
I can see her running around,
talking to everybody.

792
00:33:49,689 --> 00:33:54,172
And from day one, I've not
had a conversation with Kendra

793
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:56,793
in regards to strategy,
alliances or anything like that.

794
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:58,172
When it comes down to it,

795
00:33:58,275 --> 00:34:00,137
I have a great level
of protection.

796
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:03,000
Kellie and I are rock solid, and

797
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:04,137
I have my idol.

798
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,034
So if I...

799
00:34:06,137 --> 00:34:08,965
if I feel that I need to use it,
I'm gonna use it.

800
00:34:15,034 --> 00:34:19,379
KELLIE:
This morning I know that Kendra
wanted to target Bruce.

801
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:20,827
The thing in my head is,

802
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:21,827
I don't think

803
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:23,206
tonight is the night to do it.

804
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,275
Bruce is a hard person
to work with,

805
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:29,688
but I know he trusts me,
and that's valuable for me.

806
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:32,793
So the plan right now
is for me to get

807
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,172
Kendra and Bruce
to just get on the same page.

808
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:39,034
Whether that can be salvaged
today is gonna be hard.

809
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:42,827
♪ ♪

810
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:52,896
Yeah, I am thinking Kaleb.

811
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,585
-I want to do
whatever you decide.
-Right, right.

812
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:56,241
-And I'll push whatever story
you want. I mean...
-Yeah.

813
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,724
Yeah.

814
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:03,620
-Yeah, a thousand percent.
After today.
-Like...

815
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:06,275
-After today.
After the callout yesterday.
-Yeah.

816
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:09,862
AUSTIN:
So there is potential benefit
of keeping someone

817
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:11,655
-who also has
a high threat level.
-DEE: High threat level?

818
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:15,034
I just think that everybody
put his name down last night.

819
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:16,379
Like, that just says something.

820
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,034
Austin doesn't
want to vote Kaleb.

821
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,172
I feel like he wants
to keep the big threats,

822
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:22,103
but I'm the one who's
in the position of power.

823
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:25,275
So we're voting Kaleb,
no matter what.

824
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:26,965
-Come, come, come, come.
-Please.

825
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:28,344
-AUSTIN: Please join.
-DEE: Please join.

826
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:30,172
And I think Jake
will want to work with us,

827
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:33,482
because I feel
like he's easy to persuade.

828
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:35,448
And he knows that
if he were to go

829
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,758
against us,
we're gonna go against him.

830
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,275
And today we're
literally in the power position.

831
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:46,965
-Kaleb's got to go.
-JAKE: Okay.

832
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:48,275
-Sure.
-DEE: Yeah.
We're gonna have fun,

833
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,172
'cause he mentioned
our names last night.

834
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,034
-[chuckles]
-I don't think much
is gonna go wrong tonight,

835
00:35:52,137 --> 00:35:54,896
because last night at Tribal,
every single person

836
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,103
wrote his name down.

837
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:58,448
So if we take him out tonight,

838
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:00,413
no one's gonna be against us,
because everyone

839
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:01,482
wanted him out to begin with.

840
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:03,586
So Kaleb is a goner. [chuckles]

841
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:04,793
Boy, bye. [laughs]

842
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:05,793
Has there ever been,

843
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,172
like, a second elimination

844
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:09,172
where everybody voted
for one person,

845
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:10,689
and then they were gone
the next?

846
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,275
-No. Everybody always changes.
-I don't think so, right?

847
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,241
All right,

849

-JAKE: Have fun on your walk.

852

854
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:29,068
I don't just want to survive.

855
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:31,896

and I want to win Survivor.

856

Well, congratulations

857
00:36:33,586 --> 00:36:35,103
Congratulations to you
on making the jury.

858
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:39,068
KALEB:
I'm thinking
the exact same thing.

859
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:40,862
I've been thinking about,
strategically,

860
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,310
what makes the most sense.

861
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:43,620
What do you think,
strategically, moving forward?

862
00:36:43,724 --> 00:36:44,965
'Cause I got a couple ideas.
What do you got?

863
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:49,413
Right now?

864
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:50,862
And the reason
for that is because...

865
00:36:55,655 --> 00:36:56,896
Why does Austin know?

866
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,586
Austin does know
about Bruce's idol,

867
00:36:58,689 --> 00:36:59,758
and Katurah doesn't.

868
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:03,068
And Katurah is the third vote

869
00:37:03,172 --> 00:37:05,275
that we need
at this Tribal Council.

870
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:08,620
And so, if we let Austin share
that information with Katurah,

871
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,482
she might flip
on our entire alliance

872
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:13,379
and-and end our game before
we even have a chance to begin.

873
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:17,758
Yeah.

874
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:21,103
Yeah.

875
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,655
...100% are
voting Julie tonight.

876
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:24,758

-And you know what?
It comes to a tie...

877
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:27,620
-Yeah.
-He's scared.

878
00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:28,862
He doesn't want to be a target.

879
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:30,310
I open my fat mouth
and start going,

880
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,551
"Austin, I'm a bigger target
than you right now.

881
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:34,034
"This kid just got 12 votes.

882
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:36,172
-He's a bigger target than you."
-"What are you doing?"

883
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:37,379
-"What are you doing?"
-Yeah.

884
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:39,793
Yeah.

885
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:42,448
JAKE:
So the plan is...

886
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,000
...tonight at Tribal Council,
we put three votes on Julie.

887
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,310
If Katurah,
Kaleb and myself vote Julie,

888
00:37:53,413 --> 00:37:55,931
and Julie, Dee and Austin
vote for Kaleb,

889
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:58,000
that will put us in a tie.

890
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,068
-We would then get
the opportunity to revote.
-Kaleb.

891
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:06,206
-JAKE: If the revote
is still in a tie...
-Julie.

892
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,482
...then Dee's safe, the people
who got votes are safe.

893
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:14,448
So then Katurah,
myself and Austin draw rocks.

894
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:17,068
Austin's really scared
in this game.

895
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:19,551
And once we get to a revote,

896
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,413
I think I can convince Austin

897
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:24,137
that we don't
have to go to rocks, bud.

898
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:31,896
So it would have to be
me, you, Jake and who?

899
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,034
Potentially Austin...

-No. The Lulu idol.
-What the ...?

-He found it.

that's-that's big, like...

over the last 24 hours

00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:01,172
Dude.

1018
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:05,793
Kellie's head is...
we can't go for Bruce today.

1019
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:07,482
He is a shield.

1020
00:44:07,586 --> 00:44:09,517
Nobody's
gonna take him to the end.

1021
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,000
And that we can really rely on
him as a number in this game.

1022
00:44:14,103 --> 00:44:16,034
What do you want to do, then?

1023
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:18,965
Man.

1024
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:23,344
KELLIE:
Sifu is someone that they're
happy to take out, potentially.

1025
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,310
KENDRA:
Yeah.

1026
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:29,896
Yeah. Yeah.

1027
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,206
If I had my choice, Bruce
would be going home tonight.

1028
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,793
SIFU:
Look at that.

1029
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:37,310
KENDRA:
But Sifu's
a great second option,

1030
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:40,241
because Reba's
having problems with him,

1031
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,482
Belo would love to see him gone.

1032
00:44:41,586 --> 00:44:46,000
So Sifu
is kind of an easy target.

1033
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:50,413
-DREW: Okay.
-That is it.

1034
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:51,620
-Okay.
-That is it.

1035
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,068
DREW: Kendra comes to me,
and she says that

1036
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:58,689
she wants me to vote for Sifu,

1037
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:01,206
but I don't know.

1038
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,137
My relationship
with Sifu is not great,

1039
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:05,758
but at the same time,
I can't help but think

1040
00:45:05,862 --> 00:45:08,103
that Bruce
is the better move for my game.

1041
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,620
Bruce has a lot of power.

1042
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:15,310
-Mm-hmm.
-You have my...
like, I'm with you.

1043
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:17,137
-I got you. I got you.
-I'm with you.

1044
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:19,137
I want to give this
a chance to flourish.

1045
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:20,379
You're good. You're good.

1046
00:45:20,482 --> 00:45:21,965
-This is locked in.
-Yeah.

1047
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:23,344
-Yes, it is.
-This is locked in.

1048
00:45:23,448 --> 00:45:24,448
Yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm game.

1049
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:26,344
With this group of six,

1050
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:29,620
I think it is an opportunity
to get Bruce out,

1051
00:45:29,724 --> 00:45:33,000
but it requires
Kendra keeping her nerve.

1052
00:45:36,827 --> 00:45:38,344
-Let's talk through it.
-KENDRA: Okay.

1053
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:42,310
-So we-we-we want
to go against Sifu, right?
-Yes. Yes.

1054
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:44,896
There's also Bruce,
which is a possibility.

1055
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,620
-Yeah.
-Um, but the thing about Bruce

1056
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:48,379
is that he's
such a hard guy to read.

1057
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:50,482
-He's such a hard guy to read.
-When I talk to him, I think

1058
00:45:50,586 --> 00:45:52,689
he must be targeting me, because
he doesn't give me anything.

1059
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:53,965
He doesn't give me anything.

1060
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:55,137
That's what
I've been telling you.

1061
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah.

1062
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:04,310
KENDRA:
I don't know.

1063
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:07,793
I'm really nervous right now,
because this is a big decision.

1064
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:10,827
We got Sifu on this side.
We got Bruce on this side.

1065
00:46:10,931 --> 00:46:13,379
And, like, they're tipping
back and forth, and, like,

1066
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:15,724
I'm not sure which one
is gonna... [clicks tongue]

1067
00:46:15,827 --> 00:46:18,517
...hit the bottom and
get out of this game tonight.

1068
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,310
Can't get
a straight answer from him.

1069
00:46:27,586 --> 00:46:29,103
It's really crazy.

1070
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,586
Hmm.

1071
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:32,344
Kendra says
she wants to vote with me.

1072
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:35,000
She wants all the things
in the past to be squashed.

1073
00:46:35,103 --> 00:46:38,000
Girlfriend,
trust is definitely earned,

1074
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:39,413
it is not given.

1075
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:41,896
And I trust you
as far as I can throw you.

1076
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:48,862
Going into Tribal tonight,

1077
00:46:48,965 --> 00:46:50,689
if I feel
a little bit of tension,

1078
00:46:50,793 --> 00:46:53,344
and I'm not sure
about what's going on,

1079
00:46:53,448 --> 00:46:54,586
I'll play my idol.

1080
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:56,068
I'm probably gonna play...

1081
00:46:57,068 --> 00:46:58,000
-You are?
-Probably.

1082
00:46:58,103 --> 00:46:59,931
-Why?
-Because

1083
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:01,896
there's too much
going on right now.

1084
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,310
I don't know, Bruce.

1085
00:47:03,413 --> 00:47:04,724
You don't know what?

1086
00:47:04,827 --> 00:47:06,172
If you should or not.

1087
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:08,758
And Bruce
has become extremely paranoid.

1088
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:11,862
Working with him
is the worst part of my game.

1089
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:14,172
[sighs]
You know, I-I don't know.

1090
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:16,862
I'm still sussing out
exactly what I want to do.

1091
00:47:20,448 --> 00:47:23,379
-It could just be
a safe option... tonight.
-Yeah.

1092
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:25,310
-Actually?
-Actually.

1093
00:47:25,413 --> 00:47:28,689
KELLIE:
I'm still very torn, honestly.

1094
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:30,586
I need to make sure
that I'm making

1095
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:31,793
the smart decision

1096
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:33,000
for me.

1097
00:47:40,827 --> 00:47:42,586
Right now
I'm feeling very stressed.

1098
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:45,206
This is a real do-or-die moment.

1099
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,862
This is like
all your cards on the table,

1100
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,310
all the marbles are in,

1101
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:53,344
and which way do
I want to go, Sifu or Bruce?

1102
00:47:53,448 --> 00:47:55,689
I know that Reba wouldn't have
a problem with Sifu going home.

1103
00:47:55,793 --> 00:47:57,620
In fact,
they might be happy about it.

1104
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,413
And he's also a huge wild card,

1105
00:47:59,517 --> 00:48:01,862
and wild cards can make it
through this game and win.

1106
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:06,413
Now, Bruce has been
my struggle this entire game.

1107
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,931
He's obviously a huge threat.
I know he has an idol.

1108
00:48:09,034 --> 00:48:10,068
I know he needs to be

1109
00:48:10,172 --> 00:48:12,137
blindsided
in order to get him out.

1110
00:48:12,241 --> 00:48:15,931
And Bruce has just
been dragging my game down.

1111
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:16,965
And so,

1112
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,827
when I choose to take him out

1113
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:23,413
is probably going to be the most
important move for my game.

1114
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,655
♪ ♪

1115
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:53,586
♪ ♪

1116
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:06,551
All right, so, big twist today.

1117
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:08,344
You're divided
into two groups,

1118
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:12,275
which means, once again,
a very small Tribal Council.

1119
00:49:12,379 --> 00:49:14,758
Why is everybody looking
and shaking their heads?

1120
00:49:14,862 --> 00:49:16,310
Can't catch a break.

1121
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:17,517
-[laughter]
-Yeah.

1122
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,551
Just what you said, Jeff.
Big twist today.

1123
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:21,034
-Yeah.
-Very big.

1124
00:49:21,137 --> 00:49:23,482
Drew, for me, that is
the pivot point in this new era.

1125
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:27,689
You are either glass half empty,
"Oh, no, another twist,"

1126
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:31,103
or you're glass half full,
"Oh, boy, another opportunity."

1127
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:33,103
DREW:
Absolutely,
because this one determines

1128
00:49:33,206 --> 00:49:34,448
whether or not
you make the jury.

1129
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:36,000
And all of us
want to be on the jury,

1130
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:37,896
so the stakes are extra high.

1131
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,310
-Mm.
-And you look at this group
of people, it's an eclectic mix.

1132
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:42,896
You've got one from old Lulu,

1133
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,344
two from old Reba,
three from old Belo.

1134
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:47,034
So it's the will she,
won't she question.

1135
00:49:47,137 --> 00:49:49,137
Like, are they gonna, you know,
stay with the tried and true,

1136
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:50,551
or are they gonna branch off?

1137
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,137
And that's a scary thing.

1138
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:56,448
So, Kendra, how did you see
this uncertainty play out today?

1139
00:49:56,551 --> 00:49:59,275
You got to have,
like, a bird's-eye view,

1140
00:49:59,379 --> 00:50:00,862
and you got
to see all the options.

1141
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:04,931
And so this is a good chance
for me to build trust

1142
00:50:05,034 --> 00:50:06,862
with people who I want
to move forward with.

1143
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:11,137
That was the basis
of my conversations today.

1144
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,689
Bruce, one of the opportunities
with a small group

1145
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:16,551
is, if you survive,
you can solidify a bond.

1146
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:19,137
That is correct.
Um, but also keeping in mind

1147
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:21,517
the bonds
that you also still have.

1148
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,448
So you can solidify
a bond with someone here

1149
00:50:23,551 --> 00:50:26,620
in a small group, but if
that bond does not hold true,

1150
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:27,931
that could be friction.

1151
00:50:28,034 --> 00:50:30,172
And now you're
looking at fracture.

1152
00:50:30,275 --> 00:50:32,620
So in this fracture,
someone could come in

1153
00:50:32,724 --> 00:50:34,655
and fill in those gaps,
and then you're out.

1154
00:50:34,758 --> 00:50:35,965
PROBST:
Kellie, that's scary.

1155
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:37,586
If you're trying
to trust somebody,

1156
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:38,689
and on one hand,
they're saying,

1157
00:50:38,793 --> 00:50:40,689
"Yes, I'd like to trust you,

1158
00:50:40,793 --> 00:50:42,413
"provided it doesn't mess up

1159
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:44,103
-my other trust
I already got going."
-[soft laughter]

1160
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:45,655
Yeah, it's terrifying, Jeff.

1161
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:48,724
I mean, all through
this merge portion of the game,

1162
00:50:48,827 --> 00:50:51,724
we've been
put into random groups,

1163
00:50:51,827 --> 00:50:54,689
-literally by random rock draw.
-Yeah.

1164
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:57,586
So that automatically
blurs tribal lines.

1165
00:50:57,689 --> 00:50:59,310
Are those really gone?

1166
00:50:59,413 --> 00:51:00,965
It's still hard
to say at this point,

1167
00:51:01,068 --> 00:51:03,482
because we haven't
actually had an opportunity

1168
00:51:03,586 --> 00:51:06,068
where every single person
is on the table.

1169
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:09,586
PROBST:
Sifu, how did
you approach this afternoon

1170
00:51:09,689 --> 00:51:11,172
from your perspective?

1171
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:15,172
What I sense tonight is...

1172
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:18,034
something
I've never sensed before.

1173
00:51:18,137 --> 00:51:21,103
Is that based on just the way
people are behaving around you?

1174
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:23,068
Yeah. To be real, it's...

1175
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:25,241
I know I'm a threat.

1176
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:26,655
And I know people
are seeing me that way,

1177
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:28,379
and I'm hearing it as well.
So...

1178
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:30,413
Bruce,
do you understand why Sifu

1179
00:51:30,517 --> 00:51:32,896
might feel on the outs tonight?

1180
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,137
Yeah, everybody has
a different take on it,

1181
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:37,724
and I do understand
how he feels.

1182
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:39,620
You know, I feel the same way.

1183
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:42,310
I have
that little knot in my stomach,

1184
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:44,482
but it's one of those things
that if you can

1185
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:46,620
rely on conversations
that you've had

1186
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:49,344
and the trust that you've built
with the people that are here,

1187
00:51:49,448 --> 00:51:51,379
and just observe
throughout the course of the day

1188
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:54,379
and kind of see how their body
language is towards you,

1189
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:56,310
and you can
read people that way.

1190
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,206
SIFU:
I have to bounce off that.

1191
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,068
I don't think anyone
wants to come out and say it,

1192
00:52:01,172 --> 00:52:03,793
but I feel like there's complete
division right now, and...

1193
00:52:03,896 --> 00:52:04,827
it's pretty easy to see.

1194
00:52:04,931 --> 00:52:07,827
Three Belo, two Reba, right?

1195
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:09,275
That's the way
they could look at it, easily.

1196
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:13,103
I mean, Kellie,
Bruce, Kendra could easily say,

1197
00:52:13,206 --> 00:52:16,034
"Hey, Sifu, you look beautiful,
but sayonara."

1198
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:19,344
But my pitch
is loyalty moving forward,

1199
00:52:19,448 --> 00:52:21,275
strong, meat shield.

1200
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:24,758
There's a lot at stake there
that I don't know

1201
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:26,551
if they're
taking into consideration.

1202
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:29,275
Kendra,
is it a fair assumption

1203
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,275
that you, Bruce and Kellie
might work together?

1204
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:34,448
I can see how
somebody could say that,

1205
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,103
but following
the words of my mom,

1206
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:38,862
"You know what they say
about assuming?

1207
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:40,896
You make
an ass out of you and me."

1208
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:44,827
PROBST:
Bruce, the tricky part is,
you really don't ever know.

1209
00:52:44,931 --> 00:52:47,172
And just because
the three of you wore blue

1210
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:48,724
doesn't mean
you're still together.

1211
00:52:48,827 --> 00:52:50,241
BRUCE:
That's correct.

1212
00:52:50,344 --> 00:52:51,827
You can perceive
whatever it is that you want,

1213
00:52:51,931 --> 00:52:53,413
you can assume
whatever you want,

1214
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:55,344
but if you feel
that you're gonna be

1215
00:52:55,448 --> 00:52:57,103
continuing to build
something that you started

1216
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:58,896
in the past, execute.

1217
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,034
And if you have loyalties,
you can strengthen them

1218
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,896
with the decisions
that you make tonight.

It was my impending doom.

I did everything
that I wanted to do,

1258
00:56:08,724 --> 00:56:11,896
and in my day-to-day life
I'm a master instructor,

1259
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,551
but out here I'm a student
of the game ofSurvivor.

-[laughter]
-So, Dee, how long
after the tacos had settled

1269
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:48,655
did people start to say,
"Well, should we talk?"

1270
00:56:48,758 --> 00:56:51,827
So, we got back to camp,
and we all just were like,

1271
00:56:51,931 --> 00:56:54,448
"All right, well, we got to have
our little office hours now."

1272
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:55,793
Um, and for the most part,

1273
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:57,827
I feel like I had
genuine conversations today,

1274
00:56:57,931 --> 00:56:59,448
and very open and honest ones.

1275
00:56:59,551 --> 00:57:02,517

1276
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,000
Like, it's insane.

1277
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:06,689
Even just being at
the sanctuary bonded us today.

1278
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:08,655
Jake, how did you
experience the afternoon

1279
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:09,931
when you got back to camp?

1280
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:11,413
And now it's tribal politics.

1281
00:57:11,517 --> 00:57:13,482
Now we got to figure out
who's going home.

1282
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:15,310
Yeah, we had
a great time at the sanctuary,

1283
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:16,620
and that was a lot of fun,

1284
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,172
but, yeah,
someone's gonna go home today.

1285
00:57:18,275 --> 00:57:21,000
And it's tough,
because you come out here

1286
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:23,068
and you think you're gonna be,
like, I don't know,

1287
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:25,172
some kind of, like, robot,

1288
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,586
but, like, I respect all these
people and I like them all,

1289
00:57:28,689 --> 00:57:32,206
but there's not
12 Sole Survivors, there's one.

1290
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,620
-PROBST: Julie, agree with that?
-JULIE: Yes.

1291
00:57:34,724 --> 00:57:37,241
The way he said it was perfect.
We're not robots.

1292
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:40,344
I really thought that I could
come in and compartmentalize.

1293
00:57:40,448 --> 00:57:43,310
Now it's you have
to invest in them and they have

1294
00:57:43,413 --> 00:57:47,103
to invest in you
for that trust to matter.

1295
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:50,517
So if that gets severed,
it's not just a game.

1296
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,793
It's part of you is devastated.

1297
00:57:53,896 --> 00:57:56,827
PROBST:
Katurah,
the way Julie just said it is,

1298
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,448
"You can't be a robot,

1299
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:01,517
"and yet if you
allow yourself to be real,

1300
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,931
and people were lying to you,
and it's you, it's devastating."

1301
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:09,206
For me, this is my first Tribal
that I'm not safe.

1302
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:12,172
So I know
exactly that feeling of,

1303
00:58:12,275 --> 00:58:13,551
"I talked to some people.

1304
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:15,827
"Can I trust them?
I told people some things.

1305
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:18,206
Can they believe me?
You know, would they react?"

1306
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,655
And it's just, like,
you literally won't know

1307
00:58:20,758 --> 00:58:24,103
until you come in
with that terrible snuff.

1308
00:58:24,206 --> 00:58:27,413
So, Jake, from a stress
and paranoia level today,

1309
00:58:27,517 --> 00:58:28,827
where was everybody?

1310
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:30,793
I feel like everyone's
just trying to be like,

1311
00:58:30,896 --> 00:58:32,517
-"Everything's good.
Everything's good."
-[laughs]

1312
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,586
And it's, like,
everything's not good, Jeff.

1313
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:37,413
It's crazy. I'm like...
My mind's going wild,

1314
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,379
and I'm sure everyone else's
is, too, you know?

1315
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:40,758
But tonight's vote's

1316
00:58:40,862 --> 00:58:42,172
about getting
to the next step of the game.

1317
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:44,724
It's about:
who can I go forward with

1318
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:48,620
that I can trust,
that I can rely on,

1319
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:50,827
that I think
wants to take me farther?

1320
00:58:50,931 --> 00:58:54,482
So, Kaleb, how did you see this
play out today?

1321
00:58:54,586 --> 00:58:56,241
It's interesting, Jeff.

1322
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:58,931
I tried
to take my foot off the gas--

1323
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:00,931
not necessarily
after the sanctuary

1324
00:59:01,034 --> 00:59:02,862
but over the last day.

1325
00:59:02,965 --> 00:59:04,103
It's been a crazy ride for me.

1326
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:06,655
Last Tribal, I got 12 votes.

1327
00:59:06,758 --> 00:59:09,448
I was way too popular here,
and, you know...

1328
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:11,206
[laughter]

1329
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,862
I appreciate the shout-outs,
but at the same time,

1330
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:16,896
you realize, "Am I moving
forward in this game alone,

1331
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,172
or do I have the possibility
to move forward with allies?"

1332
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:22,344
So what I've really
tried to do is just show people

1333
00:59:22,448 --> 00:59:24,965
transparency to see that,
you know, I could actually

1334
00:59:25,068 --> 00:59:26,379
be an ally
that people can rely on.

1335
00:59:26,482 --> 00:59:28,517
PROBST:
Dee, can that strategy work,

1336
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,413
-even though he got
every vote at the last Tribal?
-[Katurah chuckles]

1337
00:59:31,517 --> 00:59:33,620
I feel like it depends
how people perceive

1338
00:59:33,724 --> 00:59:37,137
what Kaleb told them, you know?

1339
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:40,000
And, like, how much he's built
the bonds he has right now.

1340
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:41,793
That's just
all it comes down to.

1341
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:44,172
Katurah,
did Kaleb approach you and say,

1342
00:59:44,275 --> 00:59:45,482
"Listen,
I want to be transparent.

1343
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:48,034
-Nothing to lose, let's talk"?
-[laughs]

1344
00:59:48,137 --> 00:59:50,413
Yes, exactly that.

1345
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:53,862
And I think we know
that Kaleb has been really

1346
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,172
transparent with all of us
