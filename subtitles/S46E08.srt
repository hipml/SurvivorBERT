1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,936
I'm ready to get this game rolling.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,796
This feels amazing.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,410
Previously on survivor...

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,766
There it is. A full-blown idol that nobody

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,130
knows about.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,440
There is a twist.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,936
You're gonna be

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,386
randomly divided into two groups of six.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,440
Two people are going home tonight.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,626
Wow.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,696
Hunter's nami, though.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,696
If Tim wants to go against the six,

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,416
well, buddy, you are going home,

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,820
and you just don't know it.

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,650
It could be a blindside tonight...

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,650
It's not nami versus siga here.

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,006
Tonight, I want to make a big move.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,726
Vote soda.

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,230
I want to be the curator of
the first blindside of the season.

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,286
Which is why I'm so determined

21
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,486
to at least break one of them off.

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,386
Venus is trying really hard, but

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,410
she's pretty oblivious.

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,820
Seventh person voted
out of survivor46: Tim.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,340
Can I give Tim a hug real quick?

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,480
The tribe has spoken.

27
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,060
Eighth person voted
out and the first member

28
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,100
soda.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,370
The tribe has spoken.

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,510
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
listen, we'll get into it now.

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,680
- Yeah, I want to.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,480
Before everybody gets back, too. Yeah.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,486
I don't think you guys realize there's, like,

34
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,416
not much to hash out. It's, like

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,060
Tim was my first friend, so
it was just, like, a bummer,

36
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,936
- you know?
- Honestly, I know, but still want to chat.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,510
Yeah, dawgs, let's go.

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,316
I lost my good friend at tribal council.

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,750
There was this unnamed
bromance happening,

40
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,796
the gruesome twosome
twins... me and Tim.

41
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,510
And it kept me feeling
sane during the game.

42
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,416
It's funny to cry over another dude. And,

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,930
I definitely think he was...

44
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,510
He was my rock, you know?

45
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,890
- What do I have to go on?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,416
What do you have to offer me

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,796
besides you being like, "we're vibing"?

48
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,890
Right, that's...

49
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,200
They just want to talk about bull ..., bro.

50
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,726
Also, we're all vibing.

51
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,866
- I know.
- Like, everybody here is fully down.

52
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,696
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

53
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,036
- I know! -I know!
- Yeah!

54
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,370
My god.

55
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,750
When we got back to camp from tribal,

56
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,006
I'm the type of guy who
needs to lock in, focus

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,726
and move forward with the next plan.

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,866
Tim was part of the six,

59
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,510
but Tim was also playing a Tim's game.

60
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,386
So moving forward in this game,

61
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,626
I need to figure out if

62
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,316
I want to bring in someone else.

63
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,130
And with the other tribe at tribal now,

64
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,486
hopefully voting out Venus,

65
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,556
we have little time to figure
out valuable information.

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,440
It's not okay just to come to camp

67
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,796
and keke, hee-hee and ya-ya
and not make real moves.

68
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,316
- And I'm, like...
- For real?

69
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,386
I'm a game player and
I'm a game changer and

70
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,170
I'm going to change the
way this game is played.

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,680
Here we go.

72
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,246
Who we missing?

73
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,310
What?

74
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,726
So we're all expecting Venus
to be gone, and then guess

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,370
who waltzes her beautiful self in?

76
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,006
My god.

77
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,656
Venus' name has been
brought up multiple times.

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,556
No one really enjoys working
with her, no one trusts her.

79
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,036
- You want to get into it?
- Yes. Absolutely.

80
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,696
Yeah, let's hear it. Yeah.

81
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,796
Tiff and I make eyes at each other like,

82
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,620
"they didn't do it. They didn't get her."

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,130
- You want to hear the tea.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,316
Well, surprise, surprise.
Two votes against Venus.

85
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,626
- Two votes against Venus.
- Who voted for you?

86
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,890
Tevin and soda.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,310
Ooh. Ooh.

88
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,626
Let's just say a man who
claims his entire identity

89
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,820
in this game is surrounded by honesty

90
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,246
and being an honest person

91
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,486
straight-up lied to my face the entire day

92
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,246
and wrote my name down.

93
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,696
And I saw through that and,

94
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,246
you know, Karma bit them in the ass.

95
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,820
It was four against
soda, and she went home.

96
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,556
- - Damn.
- I feel bad.

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,680
No, soda took it real well.
She gave me a big hug.

98
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,176
She was like, "you got
me." I was like, "yeah, I did."

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,650
Then we're like.

100
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,130
I'm so sorry.

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,130
Venus has taken the accolades,

102
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,130
trying to commandeer the fact

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,130
that soda's going home was her doing.

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,556
Spicy legs. It was just like...

105
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,696
Yeah, we were just, like

106
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,936
I voted for Venus because I didn't know

107
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,006
if soda had an idol, I didn't
know if Venus had an idol,

108
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,726
and so that I could say,

109
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,416
"soda, I didn't vote for you.

110
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,216
"I told you I'd never write
your name down in the game,

111
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,246
and I didn't. I wrote Venus'."

112
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,796
But I don't need credit.

113
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,006
I'll explain my game
when I get to the final three.

114
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,316
So right now, I'm letting Venus be cocky

115
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,656
because, Venus, you may
not understand right now,

116
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,416
but you will very soon

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,060
when your torch is snuffed
and you're going home.

118
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,890
Look, I thought I was a cocky bitch.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,656
She was a poison copperhead.

120
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,696
Well, she thinks it was her idea.

121
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,246
- She thinks the idea was her plan...
- And I told you,

122
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,556
my first opportunity, I was writing soda.

123
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,510
That wasn't, like, an original idea.

124
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,890
But it worked, which is what I wanted.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,556
- It did.
- Went to Maria and Charlie

126
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,370
and they voted with us, so that's good.

127
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,726
My gosh.

128
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,890
Venus thinks she's a genius.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,130
Wow. Tevin made a big move.

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,346
Ever since I met all of you,

131
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,656
I've been saying, "hey, soda, soda, soda."

132
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,696
And honestly, they're taking all the credit.

133
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,936
And for someone like
me, who has a giant ego,

134
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,680
it is so hard for me to
give them both the play.

135
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,130
Well, I'll let it lie till we get her out.

136
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,316
Right.

137
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,106
I don't want to get lost
in the shuffle of things.

138
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,370
So, I have to stop hesitating

139
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,696
and I have to start taking action

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,370
or the action is gonna be taken on me.

141
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,890
You were a lot more quiet
when you were hungry.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,510
I was hungry as hell,
man, I was saying nothing.

143
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,170
I got some ideas flowing
in this head of mine...

144
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,620
And look.

145
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,556
So the q skirt is essentially

146
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,386
a hoodie flipped backwards like

147
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,820
a pouch of a kangaroo

148
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,510
with two pockets. It's gonna be

149
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,656
the next big thing.

150
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,060
I even said,

151
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,176
for a man, if you don't
want to wear no drawers,

152
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,796
you just want to wear these, you good.

153
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,486
For a woman, you don't
want to carry a purse

154
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,346
when you go to the amusement
parks or a Fanny pack,

155
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,510
you don't want that anymore,

156
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,626
you want a little more
swag... get the q skirt.

157
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,626
- Come on.
- If you just want fashion,

158
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,626
want to rip the runway
in something different,

159
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,006
and want to turn it to the side

160
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,060
get the q skirt.

161
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,680
- Come on, now!
- And it's coming in multiple colors.

162
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,626
This q skirt here will cost
less than a Fanny pack,

163
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,246
an extra bag, a sweater, a blanket.

164
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,060
All together, -all together.

165
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,106
- Dear.
- It's a one-in-one, and it's one for you.

166
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,416
- Buy three, get one free.
- Goodness.

167
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,246
I don't think it's worth a damn, but I think

168
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,176
just because of his
conviction, I want one.

169
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,820
I'm convinced. I want a q skirt.

170
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,726
There we go.

171
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,526
I'm definitely doing a q
skirt when I get home.

172
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,750
- If you a guy...
- Yup.

173
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,246
You just want a little swag,

174
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,750
but you don't want to carry a bag,

175
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,820
- you get the q skirt.
- Yup.

176
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,346
- Why?
- Will you buy a q skirt? Yes or no?

177
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,750
Sign me up.

178
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,656
Q is just a really funny guy

179
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,060
and someone who I am doing my best

180
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,626
to stay on his good side
because I've learned now

181
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,246
that q isn't just driving votes.

182
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,656
He's putting together

183
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
alliances and groups of people

184
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,936
he wants at the very end of the game.

185
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,656
So, this morning, I have perhaps

186
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,440
my most important
conversation of the game.

187
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,036
Man, I tell you, if you ever

188
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,936
are playing survivor, get up at sunrise.

189
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,006
Every single major conversation

190
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,866
I've had in this game has
happened at the sunrise,

191
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,106
when everyone's asleep in the shelter.

192
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,720
That's where the moves are made.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,580
Yeah.

194
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,036
- I'm freaking itching.
- Well, Charlie

195
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,556
I'm itching to play the game, man.

196
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,726
- Let's friggin' do it.
- Let's do it then, man.

197
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,006
Let's go. Let's go.

198
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,006
And as we're talking, I realize,

199
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,510
this is an interview for an alliance.

200
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,866
So I'm thinking,

201
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,440
I want to get hired for this position.

202
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,936
You know, I want the job.

203
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,726
Maria is going to approach you

204
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,176
about joining a bigger alliance.

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,680
- Yeah.
- This is the first step of me saying,

206
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,556
- "Charlie, I want to work with you."
- Yeah.

207
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,060
- Yeah.
- We're trying to get a six.

208
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,696
Okay.

209
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,656
This is the first time
that I'm hearing of the six.

210
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,726
I knew q had some master plans,

211
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,060
but I was never in, you know, the c suite.

212
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,866
I told you, I got your
best interest at heart.

213
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,346
Yeah.

214
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,106
So I've been, trying to
plant the seed for you

215
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,750
to join this alliance for a long time.

216
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,976
- I told you, man. I told you.
- Maria. You got my back.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,386
So this

218
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,656
mystical, powerful six
that q has thrown together

219
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,890
is made up of two
nami... tevin and hunter,

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,346
two yanu... q and Tiffany,

221
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,726
two siga... Maria and
myself, the newest recruit.

222
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,076
We got to talk, though,

223
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,200
'cause, like, this game is getting crazy.

224
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,200
I love the six, but the
six isn't impenetrable.

225
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,626
The six is probably the... shakiest six

226
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,976
that's ever existed, because guess what?

227
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,060
Tim was in the six.

228
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,726
Maria seems pretty gung ho on the six.

229
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,060
She sees it as a guaranteed way

230
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,820
to get to the final six,

231
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,246
and I see it as a way
that I might get stuck

232
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,386
with a bunch of people
I can't beat at the end.

233
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,246
Only thing we got to be careful of

234
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,890
and watch is Charlie getting smart

235
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,656
and trying to make a move.

236
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,130
Look, I just don't think

237
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,006
Charlie has it to try to turn.

238
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,076
You know what I mean?

239
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,106
- He don't have that killer instinct.
- No.

240
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,106
We're not the first group of six

241
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,696
in survivor history to say,

242
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,626
"let's get to the final six
together, then Duke it out."

243
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,796
Something always goes awry.

244
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,680
And I have to decide
am I what goes awry?

245
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,726
We can play hide-and-seek.

246
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,440
Hide-and-seek would
be so fun right now.

247
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,486
Q decides that

248
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,526
he wants to play hide-and-seek,
which is no surprise,

249
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,936
because q has been
trying to play hide-and-seek

250
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,346
since we were at yanu camp.

251
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,726
We got enough people
now, and we all full.

252
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,866
My god. Fine.

253
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,820
- Y'all want to play?
- I'm in.

254
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,556
- We better play hide-and-seek.
- Hell, yeah. - Yeah.

255
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,440
And I think it's hilarious, because

256
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,036
here we are, these grown-ass adults

257
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,036
competing with each
other for a million dollars.

258
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,370
And we're like, "let's
play hide-and-seek, y'all."

259
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,346
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,
catch a tiger by his toe.

260
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,316
My mama told me to

261
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,750
I really am a kid. I really
enjoy playing hide-and-seek.

262
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,510
But I'm gonna use this
as part of my game play.

263
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,316
But everyone else, it's just fun.

264
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,486
Ma. Yeah.

265
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,386
- I'm it?
- You're it.

266
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,486
I'm not playing around.
I'm gonna find you all.

267
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,386
Q, I'm coming for you.

268
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,130
I don't think anyone thinks that

269
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,750
this was a game play move

270
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,416
more than "q wanted to
have fun and be q" move.

271
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,556
I'm at the boat! I'm counting to 40!

272
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,680
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

273
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,556
What this game is gonna
represent for me is who

274
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,510
can hide in plain sight the best.

275
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,006
Thirty, 31, 32, thirty-three.

276
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,176
Survivor is a tense game, and

277
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,796
it's nice to just loosen up.

278
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,440
You know, sometimes you just got to

279
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,440
forget the strategy and
play a silly little game.

280
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,550
Thirty-eight, 39.40!

281
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,240
Ready or not, here I come!

282
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,440
- I did not see you at first.
- I know. I... Wow.

283
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,936
People are not half-as sing
this hide-and-seek game.

284
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,866
They are diving in the tall grass,

285
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,060
covering themselves with palm fronds,

286
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,036
going deeper into the jungle

287
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,556
than anyone has ever gone in this game.

288
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,200
Venus!

289
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,890
- No. No.
- Two down. Two down.

290
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,316
How did you see me?

291
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,510
- I saw your hood.
- That was good, though.

292
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,556
This group of ten is competitive as hell.

293
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,386
Whitney Houston.

294
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,866
My gosh.

295
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,936
Honestly, tevin, I did not see you.

296
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,456
- Yeah.
- I almost walked right by you.

297
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,006
That's intense.

298
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,176
Even though it's, like, a silly, stupid game

299
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,486
of hide-and-seek, and it's meant

300
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,626
to be, like, fun and bonding, it still

301
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,060
reveals a lot about
people's personality traits

302
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,796
and their underlying talents.

303
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,626
Tiffany in the grass!

304
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,510
Let's go.

305
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,656
Tiffany... the fact that
she hid with a red buff

306
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,866
on her head-that just tells me that

307
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,416
she's a little sloppy and may not know

308
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,790
to hide those little details.

309
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,370
- Dang, bro.
- Q over there.

310
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,416
- No way. You got q?
- Where?

311
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,006
I'm so proud of myself. I found someone.

312
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,346
Good for you.

313
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,796
It was only Liz

314
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,370
who actually walked
in the woods to see me.

315
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,796
Bad idea, Liz.

316
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,036
'Cause now I know

317
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,076
that you are playing the
game, you are paying attention,

318
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,796
and you do want to
win, as much as you say,

319
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,890
"it's just a million dollars."

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,936
Kenzie!

321
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,440
No! You got me.

322
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,836
- My god.
- You guys were like...

323
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,316
Next, we find Kenzie,

324
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,176
someone in this game that I know

325
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,316
to be a camouflage,
blend in, likable person,

326
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,680
which shows she can go undetected.

327
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,820
This was a good idea,
q. My heart was racing.

328
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,270
Maria?

329
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,060
- Maria's definitely in the well.
- Maria?!

330
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,510
Maria.

331
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,036
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

332
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,036
We just want to talk to you.

333
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,130
- That's your... Maria.
- Maria!

334
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,696
This one here!

335
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,176
I got some camouflage.

336
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,486
Maria... super creative. Like, she put

337
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,246
a little headdress on for
herself, she blended in.

338
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,486
That says to me that she's
someone who works well

339
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,246
with her surroundings
and is really adaptable.

340
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,200
If you had a sniper, we'd be gone.

341
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,796
We need to step our game up here.

342
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,176
We have 60 seconds.

343
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,750
A mad dash, or else hunter and Ben win,

344
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,726
and that would suck.

345
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,060
Split up. 60 seconds.

346
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,440
- Hunter's somewhere stupid.
- I don't know.

347
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,936
I already know we're not gonna find him.

348
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,160
If I was hunter, I would
definitely get up in the tree.

349
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,656
30 seconds,

350
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,510
and they're both safe
and they win the game.

351
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:39,170
Five, four, three, two, one. Game over!

352
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,416
Hunter and Ben win.

353
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,726
Where are they?

354
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,370
Let's go!

355
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,246
- Damn! - Where are you?
- Where are you?

356
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,796
Wait. Ben's over here.

357
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,890
- My god.
- I can only hear him.

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,440
- I see him.
- Damn, Ben!

359
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,680
- Let's go!
- Good job!

360
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,750
Ben was not found at all

361
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,076
in hide-and-seek, which means

362
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,200
this guy is capable of
playing an undercover game,

363
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,106
but be very powerful at the end.

364
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,866
Ben made a mistake.

365
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,370
Hunter, you win!

366
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,036
- We're done looking!
- That was fun.

367
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,486
- That was really fun.
- Come on, dude.

368
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,750
Good idea. That was fun.

369
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,340
- That was so much fun.
- Nice going.

370
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,200
Hunter's right here!

371
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,790
My god.

372
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,176
I said he's in a tree.

373
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,510
I got q.

374
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,386
- Hunter, you win.
- That's ridiculous.

375
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,246
Hunter made a mistake.

376
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,370
If I can't find you in hide-and-seek,

377
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,696
I can't find you in this game.

378
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,246
If you will risk going

379
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,106
that high in a tree for hide-and-seek,

380
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,796
you would take a risk

381
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,750
and take a shot at me if you could.

382
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,486
Not happening, boss.

383
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,556
Honestly, that was the
perfect ending to this game.

384
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,176
- That was sick.
- That was fun.

385
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,726
And that's what
hide-and-seek showed me.

386
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,370
That was fun. I.

387
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,246
I think it might be
important for us to have, like,

388
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,370
a little debrief chat of
what happened last night.

389
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,626
I feel like feelings ran hot on both sides.

390
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,036
- My feelings weren't hot.
- You were sad.

391
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,550
Yeah.

392
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,936
- And I think...
- Thank you for respecting it.

393
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,440
Yeah. Yeah.

394
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,936
I was a little uncertain

395
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,246
how that soda vote would be read,

396
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,416
because in my mind,
it really was my vote.

397
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,246
I put in the groundwork to
get all the necessary votes in

398
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,936
to lock that down and
make it solid, and now,

399
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,726
I'm kind of the first person
to pull off a blindside.

400
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,456
- You want to know how I pulled it off?
- Yeah.

401
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,346
I never even wanted to
write soda's name down.

402
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,416
I had a conversation
first thing that morning

403
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,656
where she'd said that she's
not gonna work for me long-term,

404
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,246
and I knew she was gonna come for me,

405
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,580
so, I... I pulled the
numbers as soon as I could.

406
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,626
- Damn, that's good.
- I know.

407
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,486
- And that's... - My god, today.
- My god, today.

408
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,316
And in terms of damage
control with tevin,

409
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,130
I found it to be very important for me

410
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,510
to air out some of our laundry

411
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,060
and to actually open up a line
of communication with tevin.

412
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,890
Can I ask you, now that
we've gotten it out of the way?

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,176
Like, I don't think I've heard you talk,

414
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,076
like, strategy-wise, like, what you see

415
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,936
for the next phase of the game.

416
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,060
- I'm moment to moment.
- You're moment to moment.

417
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,656
Yes, I understand that, but, also,

418
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,906
like, soda was the same way,
and I guess in this game, like,

419
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,820
just, like, for advice, is that you need to

420
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,346
sometimes show a little bit of, like...

421
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,556
Commitment in a direction.

422
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,866
But I think, for at least
this next short while,

423
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,796
we would benefit each
other by being more open.

424
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,696
Tevin's kind of like a fish out of water

425
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,560
in terms of the strategy
portion of this game.

426
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,386
Like, sure, he's a social butterfly, but

427
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,796
I don't think he really
knows what's going on.

428
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,796
Like, he seemed very
impressed that I was able

429
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,006
to pull that move on
him, but to me, it was like,

430
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,456
"how could you not see it
coming in the first place, tevin?

431
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,680
Like, come on."

432
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,386
Whoa. That's a new laugh.

433
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,200
She thinks, honest to god,

434
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,486
she has pulled off the move

435
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,370
that I planned for her.

436
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,696
These two are running around.

437
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,796
- "It's my idea."
- "Actually, it was mine.

438
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,370
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

439
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,316
Shut up.

440
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,510
I'm about to pee.

441
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,866
I love tevin, but I know now

442
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,796
people are seeing
him as the mastermind?

443
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,076
She said to me, "thank
you for respecting my move."

444
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,060
He navigated the soda vote

445
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,820
without soda even knowing.

446
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,556
So now, I need to give a signal

447
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,316
to the other tribe mates

448
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,036
that I'm here to play, too.

449
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,416
I love this game.

450
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,860
I'm sorry, tevin, but you got to go.

451
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,656
I know everybody's playing
survivor hard-core right now,

452
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,200
but, like, sometimes you got to, like,

453
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,060
pause the game for, like, three minutes.

454
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,726
And hear me out.

455
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,510
What has she actually done

456
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,036
to make you feel threatened by her

457
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,486
besides mentioning your name to people

458
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,130
- that aren't even taking her seriously?
- Right.

459
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,866
- Who cares?
- Right.

460
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,424
Let her stick around.
That's just another body.

461
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:46,866
Right.

462
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,316
Venus thinks she's a power player,

463
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,680
but she's really not. I wanted her out bad,

464
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,176
but I think I'd rather deal
with a nuisance than a threat.

465
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,006
So I'm trying to shift
my focus now because...

466
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,726
The point in the game

467
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,410
where you're just getting
out obvious targets is done.

468
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,906
That's the thing. I don't know who's next.

469
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,556
- That's right.
- That's the only thing.

470
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,386
You got to wait and see how
the immunity challenge shakes out

471
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,796
and see what the options are.

472
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,890
Tiffany is in my alliance.

473
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,820
However, Tiffany's getting shaky.

474
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,726
She wants to keep Venus around.

475
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,370
So, Tiffany is

476
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,246
not lining up with what the six wants,

477
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,680
and what the six wants
is six to stay strong.

478
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,030
Tiffany says Venus ain't a threat.

479
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,690
I know what you're saying.

480
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,230
I said, "Tiffany, who you want to go

481
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,936
instead of Venus then, if you
don't want to get Venus out?"

482
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,596
She said, "well, let's
just see what happens"

483
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,076
"in the immunity challenge
and let's just see who's left

484
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,440
and figure it out from there."

485
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,416
Up until this point, tiff has been

486
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,036
my number one ally in this game.

487
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,820
But tiff is trying to keep
members in this game

488
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,246
that are not part of the
six, like Venus, because

489
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,440
she's playing the old survivor

490
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,246
take a goat to the end.

491
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,130
That's not the game that I want to play.

492
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,076
In this game, you have to play a q game.

493
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,106
If you don't play my game
and you want to go off

494
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,106
and do your own thing,
then you're probably not going

495
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,316
to last in this game a lot longer.

496
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,060
And if we feel like tiff's not
gonna play get in the six,

497
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,076
then maybe tiff's gonna
lose, be sent home.

498
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,556
I'm fine with that.

499
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,486
So, I need to confirm that our games

500
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,936
are going in two different
directions, and if so,

501
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,130
then tiff might be the
next vote if she doesn't win.

502
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,006
For me, if I had to... If I
had to throw out names

503
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,696
for who I want to go
next, it would either be

504
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,346
Maria, Ben.

505
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,750
Ben is sneaky, but he's
not as smart as Maria.

506
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,556
And it just comes down to that for me.

507
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,626
Tiff has made multiple mistakes.

508
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,486
She's trying to keep goats.

509
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,796
And now tiff brought up Maria's name.

510
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,106
She's in the six, tiff. Big mistake.

511
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,510
Right now, the six is just

512
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,696
permission for q to fire.

513
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,146
If you bring up a name within the six,

514
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,060
now you've given me
ammunition to take you out

515
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,170
without any recourse.

516
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,076
- From tiff?
- Yeah.

517
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,556
She's making me super nervous.

518
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,750
And-and she-she's really
about keeping Venus.

519
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,486
Yeah.

520
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,246
Tiff said my name, and so, if someone

521
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,230
in our alliance is putting
up someone else's name

522
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,270
in the alliance, they've got to go.

523
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,316
- Which is?
- You can't repeat this.

524
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,820
Tiff has an idol.

525
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,006
Q told me that tiff has an idol.

526
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,656
I am actually really surprised
that q would tell me, that

527
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,310
that makes me trust q even more.

528
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,510
So who's our target?

529
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,346
So, let's go for tiff.

530
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,656
Got it.

531
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,346
Q's game is all about trust.

532
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,890
He does not want to feel
anybody wavering at all.

533
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,076
And so, if you show him
that you're trustworthy,

534
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,556
he's gonna work with you.

535
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,556
The minute you start
looking shady, you're out.

536
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,346
And so, we may have an alliance

537
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,100
of five instead of an alliance of six.

538
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,240
Yes.

539
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,626
Right now, this is the
biggest move yet for me,

540
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,480
to now turn on my number
one ally in the game.

541
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,076
The ideal is to keep my alliance

542
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,556
making decisions that
I want them to make,

543
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,936
under my control, under my rule.

544
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,346
It's almost like I'm a mob boss.

545
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,820
And they dare not to say a
name within my organization.

546
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,246
And if they do, send 'em packing.

547
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,310
I send 'em a q skirt, though.

548
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,240
Come on in!

549
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,750
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

550
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,176
Good morning, Jeff.

551
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,820
- Morning.
- Morning, Jeff.

552
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,626
All right, shall we get to
today's immunity challenge?

553
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,866
- Let's do it, Jeff.
- First things first.

554
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,726
Ladies, got to take back the necklaces.

555
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,750
No!

556
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,316
- Here, you take it.
- All right.

557
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,106
Thanks, Jeff.

558
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,580
Thank you, Maria.

559
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,726
All right, once again,

560
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,680
immunity is back up for grabs.

561
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,486
For today's challenge,
it is a survivor classic

562
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,370
and one I never get tired of seeing.

563
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,556
You're gonna hold onto a pole...

564
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,890
For as long as you can.

565
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,510
When you drop

566
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,796
you're out.

567
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,726
Last person left standing

568
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,440
wins immunity, guaranteed

569
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,510
- a spot in the final nine.
- Wow.

570
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,316
Losers, tribal council, where somebody

571
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,036
will be the ninth person voted out

572
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,796
and become the second
member of our jury.

573
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,200
Little something else to deal with today.

574
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,890
- I knew it. I knew it.
- How fun.

575
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,750
In this new era of survivor,

576
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,696
you start with very
little, including no food.

577
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,556
And then at a certain point in
the game, you're given a chance

578
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,006
to earn some food.

579
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,030
That day is today.

580
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,176
My god.

581
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,076
- That's a heavy bag.
- Yes.

582
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,036
Enough rice to last you
to the end of the season.

583
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,246
- Wow.
- Wow.

584
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,200
Here's what it will cost you.

585
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,370
Four players...

586
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,866
Have to agree to sit out of this challenge,

587
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,440
give up your shot at immunity

588
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,006
in exchange for the rice.

589
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,696
- And four is the Max?
- Minimum.

590
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,936
The minimum? The
minimum, right? Four is it.

591
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,316
Are you willing to negotiate, Jeff?

592
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,680
- We can't do three?
- No. Four is the set number.

593
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,370
No negotiating, Jeff?

594
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,696
I'll give you an option.

595
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,176
Four of you can agree to sit out,

596
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,370
or two of you can agree...

597
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,400
To give up your vote
at tonight's tribal council

598
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,866
and still compete

599
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,726
and still have a shot at immunity.

600
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,346
I'm gonna say, "hell, no."

601
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,656
Well, it really comes
down to the same thing.

602
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,006
Where does everybody
feel they sit in the game?

603
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,930
How comfortable are
you with your alliance?

604
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,170
Talk about it.

605
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,866
Is anyone thinking immediately,

606
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,526
- "I'm sitting out for this?"
- No one want to sit out?

607
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,036
- Nope.
- No.

608
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,726
Wow. Nobody.

609
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,416
So before we even go further,

610
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,316
Charlie, what does that say
about where survivor46 is?

611
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,796
Everyone out here is a competitor.

612
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,656
- We played hide-and-seek -for nothing.
- Yeah.

613
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,416
Not for immunity,

614
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,386
not for any advantage, and people were

615
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,796
diving into tall grass.

616
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,060
You know, hunter
climbed 20 feet up in a tree.

617
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,890
You know, these people
are here to compete.

618
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,370
And when you give us this,

619
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,656
which is one of the survivor classics,

620
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
- nobody wants to sit out.
- Yeah.

621
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,316
I'll be one.

622
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,720
Okay.

623
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,076
- I haven't eaten.
- Okay, so we've got two.

624
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,486
Liz says "I'll sit out." Q
is volunteering to sit out.

625
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,750
We just need two more
and this rice is yours.

626
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,220
If we give you an immediate third,

627
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,386
- would you give us the rice?
- No.

628
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,036
It's four. Four is not even half.

629
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,036
That's fair in this game. Venus,

630
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,076
you're shaking your head
"no," which I understand.

631
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,696
Explain why.

632
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,680
Only one person will win this challenge,

633
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,726
and I have a very good feeling
that that person could be me,

634
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,310
so I don't want to step out.

635
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,006
Is there anyone who'd step
out, like, in a pair, two at once?

636
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,030
- They just don't...
- Are you willing to step out?

637
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,076
If there's someone who's
willing to jump out with me,

638
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,866
- I'd consider it.
- I mean, stepping out now don't commit us

639
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,486
to doing it. If you step out,

640
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,370
and no one else is
doing it, he counts down,

641
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,316
and we just all do it, you
know, so if you want to step out,

642
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,796
- step out.
- Right, and then, we still play.

643
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,310
I don't know. I want to play it, though.

644
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,656
Let's make it interesting.
You keep talking.

645
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,796
I'll just quietly count.

646
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,106
Ten.

647
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,866
- Wow.
- Nine.

648
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,820
Eight. Seven.

649
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,316
Six.

650
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,836
- Five.
- I don't think anyone wants to step out.

651
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,130
Four.

652
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,416
Three.

653
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,076
Two.

654
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,626
One. We don't have a deal.

655
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,106
First time in the new era
we could not come to a deal.

656
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,556
Liz, you can step back.

657
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,130
Y'all, I'm fitting to win this.

658
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,386
- Yeah. You deserve it.
- It tells me

659
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,386
everybody here is playing,

660
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,176
this game is fully cooked.

661
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,346
- Wow.
- That's all you ever want in a season.

662
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,480
We'll draw for your
spots, we'll get started.

663
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,006
Well, it's been one of the
most unpredictable seasons

664
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,796
of survivor, and honestly, it's
why I still love doing this job.

665
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,890
Come on out. Apply to be on survivor.

666
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,480
It is a very tall pole.

667
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,036
I'm so weak.

668
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,316
It can be scary.

669
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,006
Okay.

670
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,346
All right, everybody is in position,

671
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,550
and this challenge is on.

672
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,076
You gave up rice for a
shot at security tonight.

673
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,076
This is what you're
fighting for, right here.

674
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,726
You never know when
it's you going home.

675
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,936
The only way to be certain in survivor

676
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,310
absolutely certain... is
to have that necklace.

677
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,170
Kenzie already adjusting her position.

678
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,750
Liz is going down to a smaller foothold.

679
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,076
- Q is first out. Immediately, Liz is out.
- I can't do it.

680
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,370
Seconds in,

681
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,176
and it's the two people
who volunteered to sit out,

682
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,936
q and Liz, that are first out.

683
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,890
- Kenzie's out.
- Thought she had a shot.

684
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,030
- No.
- We're down to seven.

685
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,000
Ben struggling.

686
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,410
Maria now moving a
little farther down the pole.

687
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,076
Ben sliding down. He's
out of footholds now.

688
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,386
Just the sheer willpower. It's over.

689
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,756
Ben gonna rock his
way -over to the bench.

690
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,316
Yeah.

691
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,890
My feet are too big, dude.

692
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,820
- Maria's out.
- And we are now down to five.

693
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,656
I know.

694
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,240
It is Charlie, hunter, tiff

695
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,060
whistling tevin

696
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,796
- and Venus.
- Like a little bird, Jeff.

697
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,820
You see the little birds out in the ocean

698
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,076
on them little Poles out there?

699
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,556
Sit there all day, just the wind blowing.

700
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,006
That's what I feel like, Jeff.

701
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,370
Tevin, what kind of bird would you be?

702
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,820
Ooh! Well, I'd be a peacock, Jeff.

703
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,750
I mean, I don't see a
peacock in the ocean that often,

704
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,340
but I think if I had to be any kind of bird...

705
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,680
The longest this challenge has gone

706
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,796
in survivor history is two hours.

707
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,626
Ozzy won that.

708
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,510
I'm ready to beat ozzy today, baby.

709
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,720
You all have been up
there seven minutes.

710
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,370
- Several. -Several.
- Several.

711
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,176
I think "several" has entered
the survivorvernacular.

712
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,440
Survivorforty-several.

713
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,890
- Long live jelinsky.
- Long live him.

714
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,866
Jeff, are you dropping
Taylor swift songs for me now?

715
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,556
"Long live." "Speak now."

716
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,130
- Is that your favorite?
- One of 'em.

717
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,370
Come on, tevin, find your foot.

718
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,240
You got this, tevin.

719
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,696
- Tevin slipping a little.
- Trying to get that foot back up.

720
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,106
Literally trying to pull
himself back up that pole,

721
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,890
get his feet back in.

722
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,006
- You're back in it.
- And he does.

723
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,696
We're good.

724
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,556
Tiff adjusting again.

725
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,866
Hunter readjusting.

726
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,930
You got it, tiff.

727
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,556
- You got it.
- Come on, tiff.

728
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,106
That's your last foothold...

729
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,176
Tiff continues to slide
farther down the pole.

730
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,060
- Tiff's gonna opt out of this challenge.
- Aw.

731
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,216
- Good job.
- Good job, tiff.

732
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,550
We are down to four players left.

733
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,200
I'm going down.

734
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,556
- Tevin sliding down a little farther.
- Come on, tevin...

735
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,036
- Tevin looks like he's out.
- And he is. We're down to three.

736
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,060
- Good job, tevin.
- Amazing.

737
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,130
It is Charlie, hunter and Venus

738
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,680
fighting for immunity.

739
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,936
Guaranteed spot at nine.

740
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,310
You're at 15 minutes.

741
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,620
- I know that feels like forever.
- What are you doing?

742
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Hunter adjusting.

743
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,440
Charlie moving down.

744
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,200
Venus confidently
proclaimed she thought

745
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,240
she could win this challenge. Let's see.

746
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,036
Charlie adjusts again.

747
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,820
Bit of a slip.

748
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,370
- You got it, Charlie.
- You got it, Charlie!

749
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,866
And once again, Charlie's back up.

750
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,890
Shake it... You setting me up? Aw.

751
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,550
Hunter adjusting now.

752
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,370
Venus still down on
the end, looking to fulfill

753
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,820
her prediction that she will leave here

754
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,370
with that necklace.

755
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,030
Charlie with another slip.

756
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,130
- Can he regain? And he does.
- You got it.

757
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,626
You got it, Charlie. Stand
up, Charlie. Take a break.

758
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,820
Everybody adjusting
now at the same time.

759
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,000
You got it, Charlie.

760
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,246
Venus adjusting again.

761
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,060
Trying to pull herself up or
find a foothold farther down.

762
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,006
Just anywhere that
will relieve some pain.

763
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,930
Just for a moment.

764
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,200
Venus sliding again.

765
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,486
- Not looking good for Venus.
- You got this, v.

766
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,930
Slipping more.

767
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,176
- That's it. Venus is out.
- Aw... good job.

768
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,036
- She was in there a long time.
- Good job.

769
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,486
A good effort.

770
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,890
Came up short. And
we're down to a showdown.

771
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,650
- Charlie and hunter for immunity.
- Good job, guys.

772
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,416
Been up there 20 minutes.

773
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,246
Keep fighting, Charlie.

774
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,550
The shortest win was 17 minutes.

775
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,696
Q and Liz did not last 20 seconds.

776
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,726
All right. We know.

777
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,130
It's all love.

778
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,820
How long do you think
you would last, Jeff?

779
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,370
Longer than 20 seconds.

780
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,416
My god, today!

781
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,750
- Yeah.
- That's right.

782
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,890
Damn.

783
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,076
That's all right.

784
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,486
Yeah, no q skirt for you, Jeff.

785
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,346
No discount, no nothing.

786
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,726
Not really. You?

787
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,890
Yeah. I found a couple of
rotations that work for me.

788
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,370
Charlie sliding down even more.

789
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,510
And Charlie looks like
he's about to give in,

790
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,486
but he's hanging on by his fingers.

791
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,796
- Don't let go, Charlie.
- Keep on going, baby.

792
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,556
That's how you do it on survivor, charlie.

793
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,006
Just a little tease.

794
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,060
Squeeze those glutes.

795
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,030
- Jeff?
- Yeah.

796
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,100
I've got you right where I want you.

797
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,316
- Great negotiating, Charlie.
- Yeah?

798
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,890
I have all the leverage, so
why don't we go with two bags?

799
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,750
I got to say no.

800
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,386
- Aw.
- Aw.

801
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,726
- Crawl back up, Charlie.
- Yo, don't listen...

802
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,006
Come on. Crawl back up.

803
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,346
- Crawl back up, Charlie.
- Come on, Charlie.

804
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,440
Get up there.

805
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,486
- Come on, Charlie.
- Got to get to the top. Have that rice.

806
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,076
Charlie drops. He's out.

807
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,076
- Hunter wins individual immunity.
- Damn.

808
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,626
- Safe tonight at tribal council.
- Good job, hunter.

809
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,060
Guaranteed... whoa, hunter!

810
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,750
- What is happening?
- Hunter!

811
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,960
What are you doing?

812
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,080
- He's bragging, Jeff.
- Now, you're just showing off.

813
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,626
I'm so proud of you, dude.

814
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,397
Good job, hunter.

815
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,370
It actually wasn't that
bad to stay like that.

816
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,036
Survivor MacGyver.

817
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,246
- Take a seat.
- Good job.

818
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,596
- What's up, man?
- What up, player?

819
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,200
Good job, hunter.

820
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,440
Hunter, come on over.

821
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,176
Good job, hunter.

822
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,006
All right, hunter!

823
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,556
Well-earned.

824
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,936
- Great job, brother.
- Immunity is yours.

825
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,626
Safe tonight at tribal council.

826
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,836
Cannot be voted out of this game.

827
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,556
Guaranteed a spot in the final nine.

828
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,820
- Yes.
- As for the rest of you,

829
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,440
after 16 days, that's
gonna be it for somebody.

830
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,346
Tonight at tribal, somebody
will be the ninth person voted out,

831
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,486
become the second member of our jury.

832
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,246
You have the afternoon to
figure out who it's gonna be.

833
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,176
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at tribal council.

834
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,556
- Congrats.
- Thank you, Jeff.

835
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,346
I'm ecstatic about winning.

836
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,440
I was surprised when
people didn't sit out.

837
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,076
'Cause there were a
few people I was like,

838
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,866
"do you really think you
have a chance to win this?"

839
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,130
But as of right now, my
game plan is to vote for Tiffany.

840
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,386
It seems like everyone's on board.

841
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,076
And now, like, we have an opportunity

842
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,696
to take care of it, so why not?

843
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,790
I don't see why anyone
would want to change it.

844
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,626
- Good job, hunter.
- Nice job, hunter.

845
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,726
- Great job, hunter.
- Good job, hunter.

846
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,060
All that tree time paid off.

847
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,370
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

848
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,750
I'm frustrated.

849
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:58,036
Like, the challenge has
pissed me off so much

850
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,866
because we gave up rice.

851
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,500
All these people that
want to "try the challenge."

852
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:03,486
Let it out, babe.

853
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,200
Bro, it-it was... It was just idiotic.

854
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,440
This man, in a game of hide-and-seek,

855
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,060
chose to hide in a... tree.

856
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,060
- Hunter?
- You think you gonna

857
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,316
hang on a damn pole
longer than Tarzan?

858
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,386
Get the hell out of dodge.

859
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,726
They can cancel Christmas,

860
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,386
I ain't think they gonna
hang on that damn pole

861
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,656
longer than that boy.

862
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,390
Tell me how you really feel, baby.

863
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,036
- Real mad.
- That was a bad decision, man.

864
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,890
Now we have to go
out and try to find food.

865
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,176
It doesn't affect the vote. It is time

866
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,386
to send tiff to the jury

867
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,076
because she broke my rule.

868
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,696
If you target anybody within the six,

869
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,866
you go home.

870
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,556
We talked about it a little bit earlier.

871
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,720
You still want the same plan or
you want to do something else?

872
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,006
We already knew what was up.

873
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,106
We already said, "hey, if Tiffany doesn't

874
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,176
win immunity today, she's gone."

875
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,286
She's messing with the six alliance.

876
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,680
Therefore, she got to go.

877
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,626
Okay. We got three right now. I know.

878
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,596
- Maria would go for it.
- Charlie would go for it.

879
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,836
You think Liz would go for that?

880
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,060
- Yeah.
- That's all we need.

881
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,820
In addition to the plus-one
alliance, I believe that Liz

882
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,936
would vote with us, as she
has in the past tribal councils.

883
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,176
So, if this plan goes down,

884
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,100
Tiffany will be blindsided tonight.

885
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,346
How's it going over here?

886
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,510
All I know is I'm thinking...

887
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,270
"Liz"

888
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,626
"do you just want to stay in the game..."

889
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,246
- Or do you want to play the game?
- Right. Do you want to

890
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,696
- play the game? Yeah.
- "Or do you want to, like, play

891
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,386
- "and have a... shot?"
- Yeah.

892
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,076
- I mean, I'm just gonna say it.
- Say it.

893
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,726
If this gets out, like, I'm gone tonight.

894
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,936
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

895
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,416
I want tevin gone.

896
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,006
I love tevin. We've been number ones,

897
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,176
but he made a really big move with soda.

898
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,656
Do you think that he's the
most logical threat right now?

899
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,370
Yes.

900
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,416
I, personally, I would like tevin out.

901
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,936
I want to blindside tevin.

902
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,106
I've realized who Liz
is, and Liz is a fighter.

903
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,076
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Let me just be real with you.

904
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,316
I'm looking back at the last
15 days, laughing at myself

905
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,346
at how many times I let someone else

906
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,006
take the lead, and... I'm done with that.

907
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,696
It's got to be tevin tonight.

908
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,176
- Okay.
- Thank god.

909
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,370
Finally, people have come to their senses

910
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,656
and have realized how
big of a threat tevin is.

911
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,000
From what I'm hearing...

912
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,820
Okay.

913
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,076
And I think if we all,
maybe, work together

914
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,820
- and try to get tevin...
- Okay.

915
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,076
We could probably form a comfortable,

916
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,696
maybe, chill alliance for a vote or two.

917
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,750
- Okay.
- Tevin's got the social

918
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,346
charisma like I've never seen.

919
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,726
He's so likable. In real life, amazing.

920
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,936
In a game where we're
competing for a million dollars,

921
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,006
got to go.

922
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,200
Game time, brother.

923
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:52,936
Also, the yanu three

924
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,130
has been driving so
many votes in this game,

925
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,796
and right now, I don't want

926
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,176
to be leading all of the votes
to put a bigger target on yanu.

927
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,820
- Liz... Liz wants...
- We got to vote for tevin.

928
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,626
- Liz is on board.
- Ben just told me the same thing.

929
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,796
- Okay, good. We're voting tevin.
- Yes.

930
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,796
But if it gets back to tevin,

931
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,176
- it's gonna be... That's how easy.
- And that's why... and as...

932
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,656
But, also, he has an extra vote,

933
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,076
so he could flip that on any of us.

934
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,386
Yeah.

935
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,556
Tevin is a huge threat.

936
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,006
Also, tevin has an
extra vote in his pocket.

937
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,556
And the deeper we get into the game,

938
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,936
the more power that
extra vote is gonna have.

939
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,960
What's up with you?

940
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,316
But right now,

941
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,176
q and I have a great working relationship.

942
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,076
We share information freely.

943
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,416
I absolutely cannot leave him out

944
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,820
of a vote at this point in time.

945
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,246
Everybody who I spoke
to today is saying tevin.

946
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,696
- Everybody.
- Who?

947
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,176
Liz the one who brought
tevin name up to me.

948
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,820
And she said that she spoke
to Charlie, Ben and Maria,

949
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,386
and they was with it.

950
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,030
She was like, "listen..."

951
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,386
Well, I'm gonna tell you right now,

952
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,346
if you don't vote tevin, people gonna

953
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,750
be looking at you next.
You better get on board.

954
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:00,036
The idea of a plan being
changed last-minute

955
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,890
doesn't really sit well with me.

956
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,030
Tiff was telling me about the plan.

957
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,346
- Yeah.
- Is that real coming from you,

958
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,650
- or is that just talk?
- Yes.

959
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,000
You talking about t?

960
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,680
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's real?

961
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,720
I feel like just about
everybody's on board.

962
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,556
I'm not the driver in the tevin vote.

963
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,440
And my game is based
off me being in control.

964
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,130
So I wanted to gain control again.

965
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,726
Everybody you think

966
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:39,626
is working with us have flipped.

967
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,556
Tevin is the one that's
going home tonight.

968
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,726
- They're voting for tevin?
- All of 'em.

969
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,510
- Every single person in this camp.
- Okay.

970
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,796
We can't stop it.

971
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,696
So there's no need to even bring it up,

972
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,626
because then they gonna
know I said something.

973
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,176
You see what I'm saying?

974
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,486
I ain't trying to... my game
over trying to save one person.

975
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,796
But I know if we write tiff name down,

976
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,996
she's gonna be here
tomorrow. She's not going home.

977
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,020
Okay.

978
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,626
Hunter... Q says it's actually tevin,

979
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:08,906
and we don't have
the numbers anymore,

980
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,726
but it just seems so off the wall for me.

981
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,556
Tevin's good for all of our games,

982
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,656
and we made an alliance
based off ofandy Griffith.

983
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:19,440
I want to keep tevin here.

984
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,060
And so it's like, I've got to go

985
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,656
and do this damage control

986
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,036
and get ahead of what's going on,

987
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,000
so it doesn't just
completely destroy my game.

988
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,370
Hunter walks right past me
to go to talk to other people.

989
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,726
And I'm like, "man, this guy,

990
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,656
he's doing exactly what
I did not want him to do,"

991
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,060
especially moments
before going to tribal.

992
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,836
Venus, can we talk to them real fast?

993
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,510
Can we chat with them real quick?

994
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,346
- Without me there?
- Yes.

995
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,556
I made a mistake, and now this plan

996
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,656
is all screwed up.

997
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,106
I should have kept my mouth shut.

998
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,036
The reason we targeted
tiff is because she,

999
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,796
like, went after Maria.

1000
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,036
Tevin never did that.

1001
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,036
I guess the decision is, are we fine

1002
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,346
with tevin leaving right now?

1003
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,510
He trusts us so much
that the guy's just sitting

1004
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,440
back there thinking it's all fine.

1005
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,036
- Y'all... I mean...
- No, no, I-I hear you.

1006
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,440
I hear you. I'm thinking.

1007
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,750
Anticipating chaos.

1008
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,200
For the first time in my life.

1009
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,696
I've never seen that man
run to someone and talk trash.

1010
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,880
He just... Now he's gesturing

1011
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,130
over here. Now he's gesturing

1012
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,936
- over here again.
- So, we still

1013
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,176
have the numbers, right?

1014
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

1015
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,656
The plan is tevin.

1016
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,006
There's peace in the
castle. The kingdom is calm.

1017
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,890
But now all I see is this
conversation on the beach,

1018
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,370
and my radar is going off.

1019
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,556
Something's afoot.

1020
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,510
All right, bro.

1021
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,580
There are no rules. I can go sit there.

1022
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,346
Hi. What's up?

1023
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,936
Venus, I love you.

1024
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,680
I'm really sorry. I have to talk to them.

1025
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:55,906
I know that's gonna piss you off.

1026
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,216
I'm sorry, but y'all also realize

1027
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,696
the sun is setting, and we all have talks.

1028
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,920
So, like, can y'all wrap it
up in the next few minutes?

1029
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,626
- Yes. -Sure.
- Thank you.

1030
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,860
Yes.

1031
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,726
Charlie, I want to know what you think.

1032
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,890
- You seem really upset.
- I'm not upset. No.

1033
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,976
I'm just feeling, like,
all the whiplash of today.

1034
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,370
- It's, like...
- So then you guys want to go back to tiff?

1035
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,510
Like, is that what you would prefer, or...

1036
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,642
Listen, I'll do whatever
y'all want, at this point.

1037
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:20,936
Yeah.

1038
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,106
I know, but we got to
come together as a whole.

1039
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,726
I would rather keep
the original and go tiff.

1040
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,240
- Y'all do whatever you want.
- I'm voting tevin.

1041
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,036
I have no freaking clue
what's gonna happen

1042
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,656
because of this chaos
that's been whipped up

1043
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,100
at the 11th hour.

1044
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,100
- So, so...
- I don't know what the heck's...

1045
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,106
Half of the tribe wants to get out tiff.

1046
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,680
The other half wants to
get tevin out of the game.

1047
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,556
And, at this point, Maria and I

1048
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,936
are at another crossroads.

1049
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,006
In my eyes, tevin is
the better option than tiff.

1050
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,556
Tevin orchestrated the soda blindside,

1051
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,486
but this threadbare

1052
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,796
alliance of six is thinking
about voting out tiff

1053
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,556
because tiff threw out the name Maria.

1054
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,200
And, ultimately, Maria's my number one.

1055
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:23,106
This alliance has zero
legs. It's going nowhere.

1056
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:25,486
It's the loosest use of the word "alliance"

1057
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,440
that has ever existed, but, once again,

1058
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,176
Maria and I have to commit

1059
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,100
and we have to make a decision.

1060
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,820
Well, all right, I guess we got to start

1061
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,416
with the rice negotiation.

1062
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,440
It's 16 days with very little food.

1063
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:22,890
Q, you tried.

1064
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,370
You were the first to say, "I'll volunteer."

1065
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,486
Wisely so, 'cause you were
first out of the challenge.

1066
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:30,936
Has there been any
discussion about that?

1067
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,796
I had a bit of a

1068
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,346
temper tantrum back at camp, after.

1069
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:37,036
I was still upset and mad.

1070
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,726
I mean, I think five people
were out within two minutes,

1071
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:43,936
and there was only gonna be
one winner and one loser tonight.

1072
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,556
So everyone suffered
when I think the odds were

1073
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,510
in their favor to feed
everybody for another nine days.

1074
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,370
Liz, another thing that is very difficult

1075
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,106
to try to understand until you're here

1076
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:59,510
is what hunger after 16 days feels like.

1077
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,510
Are you surprised that the group

1078
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,656
couldn't make a deal?

1079
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,316
I was surprised that q sat out.

1080
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,386
I thought I was gonna
be the only one to step up

1081
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:11,486
because I can't eat
coconut, I can't eat papaya.

1082
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,820
Even some of the rewards I have

1083
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,680
barely been able to eat.

1084
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,750
I haven't even gone to the restroom yet.

1085
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,796
Tiff, is the rice negotiation

1086
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,796
just an indicator of where this game is?

1087
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,486
Absolutely.

1088
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,750
Nobody feels safe enough to step out.

1089
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,556
Everybody feels like they
need to compete for immunity,

1090
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,416
and that was blatantly obvious.

1091
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,626
They said food is not
as important as safety.

1092
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,130
But, Jeff, I want to stop before

1093
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,510
we get deep into the tribal.

1094
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,130
The only person that's
going home tonight is me.

1095
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:48,820
And I'll tell you why.

1096
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,626
Wait, wait, w... you mean
you're predicting your vote out?

1097
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,200
Yeah. Well, I don't think anyone here

1098
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:58,176
coming into the tribal
council was voting for me,

1099
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,750
but I'm gonna ask
everybody to vote for me.

1100
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:05,440
Then all of these nine folks
are going back to camp today.

1101
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,370
I feel like...

1102
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,906
- Let me just interrupt real quick.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1103
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,796
Is this news to everyone?

1104
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,486
- Yeah. What is going on?
- What the hell? -Totally.

1105
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,726
Q, what are you talking about?

1106
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:20,106
So if someone goes
home tonight, and it wasn't

1107
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,890
the right way, because, like I say,

1108
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,316
there's probably five
people here right now

1109
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,820
who are like, "who the
heck am I voting for?"

1110
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,890
Because of mistakes
that I made in the game.

1111
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,176
And I want everybody to start
just playing the game hard.

1112
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,480
You have a new beginning.

1113
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,950
Kenzie, it's clear what he's saying, right?

1114
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:41,416
Yeah.

1115
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,656
To everyone. He is saying, "vote me out."

1116
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,680
Is that clear to everyone?

1117
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,766
- It's clear, but, like, what?
- Yeah, it's clear, but it doesn't...

1118
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,176
- But it doesn't make sense.
- But I don't understand why.

1119
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,106
The math isn't math-ing,
because I've talked to q,

1120
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,820
and I know that q is here
and he wants to play the game.

1121
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,626
And I guess it's just
kind of out of the blue,

1122
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,936
and it's just very unexpected.

1123
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,726
It's not something that
was even hinted towards.

1124
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,270
- I mean, it is completely off-brand.
- Yeah.

1125
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:07,820
And yet, Ben, we just
talked about how competitive.

1126
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,680
It's so competitive,

1127
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:12,200
you wouldn't give up your
shot at immunity for rice.

1128
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,106
And here's somebody
saying, "guess what?

1129
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,556
Merry Christmas."

1130
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,006
You know, q and I did
not get off to a great start,

1131
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,696
but everybody knows
he's been playing hard

1132
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,626
and in a genuine way.

1133
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,890
So it's like this... th...

1134
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,680
Even me, who's been, like,

1135
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:31,726
kind of skirting around
him, is like, "what?"

1136
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,936
This is actually, like, probably the most

1137
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,416
bonkers thing I would
have expected tonight.

1138
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,200
Tiff.

1139
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,696
I'm very confused, Jeff.

1140
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,200
I don't know where this
is coming from because

1141
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,130
I've known q since I got
here, and q's a competitor.

1142
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,796
So this is completely, like,
coming out of left field for me.

1143
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,556
It's-it's not me giving up. Trust me.

1144
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,006
I want to play, and I've
been playing since day one.

1145
00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:00,386
But again, when something
don't sit right with me

1146
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,890
and I feel partially responsible for it,

1147
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,656
I got to own up to it and
say, "you know what?

1148
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,346
I'm not gonna steal someone
else's joy and dream,"

1149
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:12,796
especially in this game, where
you only get an opportunity

1150
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,060
to potentially play once.

1151
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,036
- And...
- I think you can own up to it,

1152
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,440
person to person,
without leaving the game.

1153
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,130
And I don't think anyone wants you to go.

1154
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,486
- Yeah.
- And I-I know y'all don't, but

1155
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,346
someone is going to get voted out

1156
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:30,060
because of last-minute
things that happened,

1157
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,386
and I feel partially responsible for it.

1158
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,820
And I'm big enough to say that I want

1159
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,656
you guys to go on and play.
I'm serious about this, now.

1160
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,246
I want y'all to go on and play,

1161
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,246
but start playing the game.

1162
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,130
'Cause everybody
have a new opportunity.

1163
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,820
So, Kenzie, on one side,

1164
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,370
q's volunteering, which means
nobody else here is going home.

1165
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,036
On the other side, q is a vote,
and he's probably in an alliance

1166
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,346
with one or two or three or
who knows how many people.

1167
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:02,200
So that also will impact the game.

1168
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,626
Yeah. Q's saying, "go
ahead. Fresh start."

1169
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:08,076
What if you were a part of
my plans five plans from now?

1170
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,626
That's not a fresh start for me.

1171
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:12,556
That's undoing the plans
that I've been building.

1172
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,346
Like, it's gonna be
wacky no matter what.

1173
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,750
Like, it's not, like, we're gonna

1174
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,316
go back to camp and be like,
"well, q's gone. No worries."

1175
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,146
Like, "we're all Kumbaya."

1176
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,036
Because all we gonna do is
go back with a bunch of questions.

1177
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,839
We know exactly who
you were talking to last.

1178
00:56:22,863 --> 00:56:23,976
But we can't get answers

1179
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,890
Jeff, but at the same
time, q is a grown man,

1180
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,370
and this is a game for not one dollar,

1181
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,890
not $1,000, but one million.

1182
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,936
And if someone wants to
walk out of the game willingly,

1183
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,790
then I am not going to
coddle them to say, "stay."

1184
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,510
Can we talk? Can we talk
for a minute? Can we talk?

1185
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,170
Yeah. It's your tribal.

1186
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,200
Boy.

1187
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,510
I guess we're at a live tribal, Jeff.

1188
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,890
I don't know.

1189
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,510
It's like, "dude, what is up?"

1190
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,860
I don't understand why...

1191
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:23,580
Okay?

1192
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,170
This does not rock.

1193
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:00,240
Kenzie, come here.

1194
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
My...

1195
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,006
Wow.

1196
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,346
I don't know who. I don't know.

1197
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,890
I don't know what to do.

1198
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,270
Okay.

1199
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,960
Never seen anything like this.

1200
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,820
All right.

1201
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,036
In one of the craziest tribals ever,

1202
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,316
it is time to vote.

1203
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,960
Q, you're up.

1204
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,930
That was the dumbest thing ever.

1205
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,130
Dumbest tribal ever.

1206
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,440
My god.

1207
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,036
At this point, I don't know if this

1208
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,510
is the real plan, the fake plan.

1209
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,936
This is what I was told.

1210
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,440
And we want to flush
the extra vote tonight.

1211
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,000
Whatever.

1212
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,006
I'm as confused as hell.

1213
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,626
I don't know what the hell going, q,

1214
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,626
but clearly you been out of
Mississippi too damn long,

1215
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,060
'cause your brain is gone.

1216
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,316
But we can talk about that
when we get back to camp.

1217
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,626
I'm gonna put this down.

1218
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,750
Give me some good luck.

1219
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,510
I'll go tally the votes.

1220
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,036
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,

1221
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,750
now would be the time to do so.

1222
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,100
Okay, I'll read the votes.

1223
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,240
Venus.

1224
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:42,650
Tevin.

1225
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,246
Venus.

1226
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,650
Two votes Venus, one vote tevin.

1227
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,726
Tevin. We're tied.

1228
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,100
Two votes Venus, two votes tevin.

1229
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,720
Tevin. That's three votes
tevin, two votes Venus.

1230
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,170
Tevin. That's four votes
tevin, two votes Venus.

1231
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:19,620
Tevin. That's five votes
Kevin, two votes Venus.

1232
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,866
Ninth person voted out

1233
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,370
and the second member of our jury:

1234
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,796
Tevin. That's six. That's enough.

1235
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,790
Need to bring me your torch.

1236
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,790
That was so shocking.

1237
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,036
Y'all can go eat worms and slugs.

1238
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,936
- Tevin, we love you.
- Love you.

1239
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,556
- Love you, tevin.
- Love you, tevin.

1240
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,180
- Tevin, you rock.
- Y'all say that now.

1241
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,680
This is so exciting, Jeff.

1242
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,866
Okay. I'm sorry.

1243
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:54,866
- Tevin...
- Yeah?

1244
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:56,480
The tribe has spoken.

1245
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,626
Time for you to go.

1246
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,440
- Good job, brother.
- Good luck, y'all.

1247
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,106
Tevin, you rock.

1248
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,370
This doesn't rock.

1249
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,510
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

1250
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,620
Good night.

You... Are you stupid?

01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:43,346
Are you dumb?

1255
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:45,200
Next time on survivor...

1256
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,960
Everybody's turning on everyone.

1257
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,890
This game's flipped on its head.

1258
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,726
These bumbling buffoons.

1259
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,030
These two dum-dum meatheads.

1260
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,220
I'm-a give 'em hell. They
can cancel Christmas.

1261
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,076
I was absolutely blindsided,
which is actually kind of epic.

1262
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,176
I was a little bit confused
tonight about q's antics,

1263
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,696
but I am so happy

1264
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,246
at every single thing that I've done here.

1265
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:11,796
I have shown myself,
and I am so thankful

1266
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,556
for the opportunity to do this thing

1267
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,346
that I've been watching
since I was a little boy.

1268
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,440
This is a dream come
true. And god is so good.
