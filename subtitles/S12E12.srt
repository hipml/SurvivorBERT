wolf from La Mina.

>> I've got a huge target on

7
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:12,053
my back, but the longer I hang

8
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,638
out, the longer I get to see

9
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,181
how they end up turning on one

10
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,766
another.

11
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,892
>> PROBST: The reward challenge

12
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:18,810
revealed what the tribe really

13
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,103
thought of Courtney.

14
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,105
Who is the most annoying person

15
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,857
out here?

16
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,357
Everybody says Courtney.

17
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,692

19
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,527
most questions correctly.

20
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,153
Cirie wins this challenge.

21
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,488
Who are you sending to Exile

22
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,614
Island?

23
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,282
>> Terry.

24
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:32,657
>> PROBST: Terry.

25
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,283
And she chose Danielle and Aras

26
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,828
to go with her on a spa reward.

27
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,787
Back at camp...

28
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,496
>> I'm going to have to live

29
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,164
with this for the rest of my

30
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:39,873
life.

31
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,415
>> PROBST: ...Courtney was

32
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,499
pained by the revelations from

33
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,542

34
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,543
>> I was so happy to be here,

35
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,586
like, yesterday.

36
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,254
I don't want to be here.

37
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,130
>> PROBST: Bruce's pain was

38
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,506
physical.

39
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,633
>> My whole back, my stomach,

40
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,844
the pain is just increasing.

41
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,929
>> PROBST: At the reward, Cirie,

42
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,139
Aras and Danielle enjoyed

43
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,099
themselves.

44
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:58,641
>> If I'm out of the game

45
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,518
because of this, at least I got

46
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,730
to do this before I went.

47
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,565
>> PROBST: While back at camp...

48
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,733
>> Oh, God!

49
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,400
>> PROBST: ...Bruce's health

50
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,109
took a turn for the worse.

51
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,528
>> Are you allergic to anything?

52
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,196
>> PROBST: The medical team

53
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,864
arrived to assess him.

54
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,533
>> He can't stay here.

55
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,618
>> PROBST: And Bruce was

56
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,077
evacuated.

57
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,246
>> See you in a minute, Brucey.

58
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,247
>> PROBST: Alone in camp,

59
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,083
Courtney and Shane made a pact.

60
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,752
>> If I need your vote, would

61
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,212
you trust me and not break my

62
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:27,420
back?

63
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,838
>> You know I want to be on

64
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,756
your backside, and I would like

65
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,799
you to be on mine.

66
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,382
>> Okay.

67
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,759
She is a dream to take to the

68
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,843
final two.

69
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,178
Anyone could win against her.

70
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,346
Anyone.

71
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,473
>> PROBST: When Cirie, Aras

72
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,933
and Danielle return...

73
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,850
>> Welcome home.

74
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,434
>> PROBST: ...they learn the

75
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,393
news about Bruce.

76
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,520
>> We lost a member.

77
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,730
>> Oh, my God!

78
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,023
>> Bruce went home?

79
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,566
>> Yeah. He was med-evac'd out

80
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,776
of here.

81
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,485
And I have no idea if he's in

82
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,361
the game, if he's okay.

83
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,238
I don't know anything.

84
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,781
>> Wow.

85
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,990
>> Is that Terry?

86
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,157
Wow.

87
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,784
>> PROBST: Terry was picked up

88
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,952
from Exile Island...

89
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,702
>> Welcome, Jeff.

90
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,411
>> PROBST: ...and landed at the

91
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,830
camp beach.

92
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,331
Bruce is going to be okay, but

93
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,042
he is no longer in the running

94
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,669
for a million dollars.

95
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,462
We're hoping that Bruce will be

96
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,296
back and continue on as a member

97
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,298
of the jury.

98
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,883
It is now down to you six.

99
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,384
Nobody will be voted out

100
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,386
tonight.

101
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:16,719
Six are left.

102
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,014
Who will be the next to go?

103
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,015

>> What are you thinking of

108
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,422
using for bait?

109
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,924
>> I got hermit crabs.

110
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,383
I want to see...

111
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,719
We're running out of food, so

112
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,887
we got to use every method to

113
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,014
catch.

114
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,223
>> Bruce being gone out of this

115
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,266
game was a good thing for me

116
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,935
because I got to skip a

117
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,186
challenge.

118
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,104
And pretty much every immunity

119
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:08,730
challenge coming down the road

120
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,565
I've got to take.

121
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,943
It is really imperative to try

122
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,528
to make some allies and,

123
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,488
hopefully, tie up one or two

124
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,698
members before the next

125
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:41,763
immunity challenge.

126
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,472
>> I was going to the rocks

127
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,849
today, and I saw this thing,

128
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,726
just like that, and it was

129
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,144
just...

130
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,395
I was, like, wow, BlackBerry.

131
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,730
It reminded me of my BlackBerry.

132
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,399
So I grabbed it, and I've just

133
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,444
been playing with it.

134
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,660
It's got texting, e-mail, phone,

135
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,078
Web browser.

136
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,788
It's got everything.

137
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,747
When I think about something I

138
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,706
want to tell my partner, I

139
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,166
shoot him off, or talk about my

140
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,334
son, because my son can text on

141
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,211
his cell phone.

142
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,504
It's actually helped my day.

143
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,422
I'm communicating with people

144
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,591
not on this island.

145
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,726
>> Shane found a piece of wood,

146
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,312
and is actually calling it his

147
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:31,604
BlackBerry.

148
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,482
>> Look for the address.

149
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,025
>> And he sits down and he,

150
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,235
like, pretends like he's

151
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,653
communicating with people.

152
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,570
>> Send.

153
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,656
>> Come on.

154
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,533
>> Check mark.

155
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,660
All good.

156
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,746
>> He's nuts.

157
00:04:54,794 --> 00:05:06,139
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

158
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:06,889
Ready to get to today's

159
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,515
challenge?

160
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,349
>> Oh, yeah.

161
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:08,891
>> PROBST: It is for reward.

162
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,268
Here's how it works.

163
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,394
You'll be divided into two

164
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,187
teams of three.

165
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:13,813
Each of you will be attached to

166
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,356
one long rope which runs the

167
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,192
length of an obstacle course.

168
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,111
On my go, you must follow the

169
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,946
rope while navigating the

170
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,490
various obstacles.

171
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,533
When you reach the final

172
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,202
platform, you'll unclip and,

173
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,370
one at a time, race across a

174
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,122
lily pad run.

175
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,457
You'll then jump into the water

176
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,208
and retrieve a bag.

177
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,252
There are three bags total.

178
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:36,878
Once you have all three bags,

179
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,546
clip back into the rope and

180
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,590
make your way back across all

181
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,467
the same obstacles to the

182
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,052
finish.

183
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,053
First team to get to the finish

184
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,429
with all three members and all

185
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,639
three bags wins reward.

186
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,140
Want to know what you're

187
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:49,932
playing for?

188
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,933
>> Yeah!

189
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,768
>> PROBST: The winning three

190
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,518
will leave here, fly to your own

191
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,063
private island, where you will

192
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,272
have a barbecue feast.

193
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,732
>> Yeah!

194
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,776
>> PROBST: Steak, sausages, a

195
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,568
cooler of soft drinks and, for

196
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,696
dessert, chocolate cake.

197
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,739
>> Oh, my God!

198
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,531
>> PROBST: Worth playing for?

199
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,074
>> Oh, yeah!

200
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,200
>> PROBST: All right, we'll

201
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,117
randomly draw teams and get

202
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,829
started.

203
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,538
It's Terry, Danielle and

204
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,958
Courtney taking on Cirie, Aras

205
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,335
and Shane.

206
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,170
For reward, survivors ready?

207
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,423
Go!

208
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,383
Strategy is going to be key in

209
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,344
this.

210
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,678
>> Help me up.

211
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,638
>> PROBST: Aras helping Cirie

212
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,597
over.

213
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,515
She takes a hard fall right

214
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,268
away.

215
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,229
Courtney, Terry, Danielle

216
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,605
through the hitching post.

217
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,941
Cirie, Aras, Shane right

218
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,567
behind!

219
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,403
Terry, Danielle, Courtney first

220
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,280
to the pole.

221
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:46,614
Cirie's there.

222
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,116
Somebody's going to have to

223
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,201
help.

224
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:50,701
Gotta follow that rope!

225
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,495
That's all you gotta do is

226
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,664
follow that rope.

227
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,624
We are still very tight.

228
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,626
Now it's going to get a little

229
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,044
tougher having to crawl under

230
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,423
and over.

231
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:09,595
Cirie back into the water.

232
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,638
>> All right, back up.

233
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,224
Aras trying to help Cirie.

234
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:13,766
>> You're going to go

235
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,768
underneath.

236
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,686
>> PROBST: Terry through the

237
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,937
bamboo crawl and on to the

238
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,064
platform.

239
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,648
Danielle's on the platform.

240
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,484
Aras, Shane, Cirie, they have

241
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,444
twisted themselves up.

242
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,737
They have really slowed down,

243
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,990
and they're really in a mess.

244
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,701
Courtney up on to the platform.

245
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,286
Terry unclipped and making his

246
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,622
way across the lily pads.

247
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,876
You gotta jump in and get a bag

248
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,795
out of the box.

249
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,012
Terry up with the first bag!

250
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,055
Aras, Cirie, Shane, you need to

251
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,348
get moving!

252
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,686
You are taking too much time!

253
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,646
Terry back with the first bag.

254
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,649
Danielle making her way easily

255
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,609
across the lily pad.

256
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,613
No trouble.

257
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,240
Shane, Aras, Cirie are all

258
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,783
knotted up, can't figure out

259
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,534
what to do.

260
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,703
Danielle back with the second

261
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,787
bag.

262
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,040
One bag left.

263
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,249
Courtney has no trouble with

264
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,667
the lily pads.

265
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,048
Courtney has the third bag, and

266
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,674
heading back.

267
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,717
Cirie, Aras, Shane are falling

268
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,719
out of this challenge.

269
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,721
Courtney back with the third

270
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,597
bag.

271
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,098
Clip in and head back!

272
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,142
Cirie, Aras, Shane almost look

273
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,769
like they've given up.

274
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,728
Get your asses out of that

275
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,604
water.

276
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,147
Let's go!

277
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,357
Terry, Danielle, Courtney, this

278
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,693
is their challenge to lose now.

279
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,695
Shane finally up on to the

280
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,239
platform.

281
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,573
Shane unclipped.

282
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,368
He's going to give it a go.

283
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,827
Wastes no time!

284
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,956
Hanging on!

285
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,504
Terry, Danielle, Courtney back

286
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,297
at the rope twist with nobody

287
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,966
close.

288
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,511
Shane back with the first bag.

289
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,346
Terry, Danielle, Courtney

290
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,597
through the rope twist.

291
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,932
Home free.

292
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,309
Cirie, Shane, Aras still

293
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:20,685
fighting.

294
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,478
But it's going to be too little,

295
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:22,770
too late.

296
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,688
Terry, Danielle and Courtney

297
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,733
with one obstacle left.

298
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,282
Terry across.

299
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,075
Danielle across.

300
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,451
Courtney across!

301
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,661
Terry, Danielle, Courtney win

302
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,290
reward!

303
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,882
Terry, Courtney, Danielle, nice

304
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,217
job.

305
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:53,843
Barbecue feast is yours.

306
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,345
And a big decision to make.

307
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,722
Cirie, Aras, Shane-- one of

308
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,265
those three is going to Exile

309
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,308
Island; give you a second

310
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,601
to talk about it.

311
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,481
>> What do you want?

312
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,024
>> Whatever you guys want.

313
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:08,983
>> Okay.

314
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,318
>> PROBST: Who is it going to

315
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:10,484
be?

316
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,277
>> Aras.

317
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,945
PROBST: Aras, you know the

318
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,613
drill.

319
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,489
Grab your stuff, boat's coming

320
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,741
in.

321
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,951
>> More beans for us, Cirie.

322
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
>> PROBST: Cirie and Shane,

323
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,203
sorry, got nothing for you.

324
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,956
Head on back to camp.

325
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,041
>> Enjoy.

326
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,169
>> We'll see you tonight.

327
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,171
>> PROBST: Terry, Courtney,

328
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,506
Danielle, before we get to your

329
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,342
barbecue feast, you will

330
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,552
compete head to head in another

331
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,055
challenge with an additional

332
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,891
individual reward up for grabs.

333
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,392
Here's how it works: you'll use

334
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,561
a slingshot to fire marbles at

335
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,229
three ceramic tiles.

336
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,689
First person to knock out all

337
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,903
three tiles wins fully loaded,

338
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,574
2007 GMC Yukon.

339
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:01,494
>> Oh, my God!

340
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,411
>> Oh, my God.

341
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,871
>> Whoo!

342
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,914
>> PROBST: Sound good?

343
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:05,790
>> Excellent!

344
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,874
>> PROBST: Take your spots.

345
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,959
We'll get started.

346
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,714
In order for a tile to be

347
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,341
considered hit, it must break

348
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:15,966
away from two of the four ropes

349
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,010
connecting it.

350
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,095
You can hit the tiles in any

351
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,137
order.

352
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,472
First person to break all three

353
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,932
tiles wins the Yukon.

354
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,892
Ready, pick up your slingshot,

355
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,853
get your marbles.

356
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,481
Here we go, first round.

357
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,733
Ready, aim, fire.

358
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,569
Courtney nicks hers, but not

359
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,071
enough.

360
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,032
Ready, aim, fire.

361
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,995
Danielle breaks her first tile.

362
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,872
Terry clips one, but he's only

363
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,332
broken one rope.

364
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,875
That is not a hit.

365
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,920
Ready, aim, fire.

366
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,633
Terry finishes what he didn't

367
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,093
do the first time, knocks his

368
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,719
first tile down.

369
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,638
Danielle clips a second one,

370
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,931
but not enough.

371
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,393
GMC Yukon on the line.

372
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,938
Ready, aim, fire.

373
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,566
Courtney smashes her first tile.

374
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,734
Terry breaks his second tile.

375
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,361
Danielle just low.

376
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,155
Terry down to one tile left.

377
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,573
Danielle, Courtney both have

378
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,907
two tiles left.

379
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,119
Ready, aim, fire.

380
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,079
Danielle misses left.

381
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,624
Courtney breaks her second tile.

382
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,043
Terry clips his third tile.

383
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,003
That's not enough.

384
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,255
Courtney and Terry both only

385
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:36,881
have one tile left.

386
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,841
Either one could win this

387
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,093
challenge on this shot.

388
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,849
Ready, aim, fire.

389
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,185
Danielle just misses.

390
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,104
Courtney just misses.

391
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,439
>> Yes, yes, yes!

392
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:53,981
>> PROBST: Terry gets it!

393
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,151
Terry wins the GMC Yukon.

394
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:57,818
>> Unbelievable.

395
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,360
>> PROBST: Here's how it's

396
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,778
going to work.

397
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,779
You're going to fly to an

398
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,739
island.

399
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,364
When you land, your car will be

400
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,824
waiting for you.

401
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,992
It will be loaded with

402
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:05,534
everything you need for your

403
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,660
barbecue.

404
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,411
>> All right, all right.

405
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,496
>> PROBST: You'll return to camp

406
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,622
back later today.

407
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,706
>> Excellent.

408
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,707
>> PROBST: Grab your stuff and

409
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,249
head on out.

410
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,668
>> All right, let's go barbecue!

411
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,230
>> At this point in the game,

412
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:34,897
from what I understand, the

413
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,733
idol's not here anymore.

414
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,859
It's been found, and now it's

415
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,153
hiding somewhere in Terry's bag.

416
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,072
And so I won't really waste any

417
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,615
of my energy looking for it or

418
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,991
stressing about it because that

419
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,409
part of the game is now out of

420
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,495
my control.

421
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,665
Kind of makes my stay here

422
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,041
pretty unnecessary in terms of

423
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,670
the positives.

424
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,973
>> We were airplaned off to a

425
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,391
far island where we were to

426
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,476
have our feast.

427
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,272
>> Oh, it's gorgeous!

428
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,399
>> Oh, my God!

429
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,692
>> At the end of the runway,

430
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,234
there in front of us was a

431
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,237
brand-new, spankin' Yukon, and

432
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,114
it was righteous, man.

433
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,616
>> Wow!

434
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,286
Oh, mother of...

435
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,870
>> This is gorgeous.

436
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,080
>> The last thing my wife said

437
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,540
going out the door was, "Damn

438
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,625
it, just bring me home a car."

439
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,671
Let's see what this bad boy can

440
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:40,963
do.

441
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,215
In pile the girls, and off we

442
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,010
drove to this beach feast.

443
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,810
Oh!

444
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,104
>> This is so nice to, like, be

445
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,232
on the winning side of things.

446
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,025
That's like, seriously, like,

447
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,110
was, like, the dream team.

448
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:03,360
>> Salud!

449
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,779
Congratulations, Terry.

450
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,865
>> Thank you.

451
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,577
>> I would do anything to get

452
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,621
us to a final three.

453
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,955
>> I'm 100% behind you.

454
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,041
I mean, that's a great final

455
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,125
three, wouldn't you say?

456
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,043
>> I'm going to start putting

457
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,128
out some feelers to Courtney

458
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,047
and Danielle today, try to

459
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,214
forge a relationship with those

460
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,007
guys in order to take us to the

461
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,217
final three.

462
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,469
>> The thing is, if you just

463
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,094
win the next immunity challenge

464
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,138
and take Aras out, and the next

465
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,514
one, one of us will win, and we

466
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,349
take Shane out...

467
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,016
>> Shane out.

468
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,558
>> ...and boom, we're final

469
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,184
four, done.

470
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,269
It's been in the back of my

471
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,604
mind to join up with Terry for

472
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,065
like a long time because going

473
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,442
against Terry is one pretty

474
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,986
good shot of actually winning

475
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,821
the million in the final two.

476
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,364
I think that's kind of how

477
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,240
people are looking right now is

478
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,200
who do you want to be up

479
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,828
against in the final two?

480
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,372
>> Well, D, I was talking to

481
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,791
Courtney while you were gone.

482
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,792
You know, we talked kind of

483
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,460
like the dream final three,

484
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,169
final four, whatever.

485
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,838
And if you were with us, and

486
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,007
it was us three and Cirie, you

487
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,510
would have a 75% chance of

488
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,886
winning immunity, and that

489
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,930
would be pitting us three up

490
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,098
against Cirie.

491
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,891
If I can produce the hidden

492
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,352
immunity idol, then, you know,

493
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,437
even so, we've got three people.

494
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,188
We'd have to beat Cirie.

495
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,399
>> Uh-huh.

496
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,942
Terry brought up the fact that

497
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,026
his ideal four would be the

498
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,903
three girls and him, and that's

499
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,863
just a given.

500
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,532
I mean, obviously, he wants

501
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:31,782
Aras out.

502
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,242
For his sake.

503
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,245
I like that idea, but he's

504
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,246
going to have to change up his

505
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,831
strategy a little bit, too.

506
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,581
I'm not going to make this so

507
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,667
easy for him to win.

508
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,593
>> It's just the two of us, and

509
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,512
we can talk about strategy all

510
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,014
we want.

511
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,391
We're through to the five,

512
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,183
right?

513
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,853
>> Right.

514
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:01,437
>> If Terry wins immunity, me,

515
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,104
you, and Aras are still

516
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,022
through, because we're going to

517
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,357
vote off Danielle.

518
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,484
>> But then there's still

519
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,110
Courtney.

520
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,987
It will be me, you, and

521
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,947
Courtney.

522
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,948
Right.

523
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,950
Mm-hmm.

524
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,868
If he could take Courtney to

525
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,869
the final two and he may just

526
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,578
win a million dollars.

527
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,996
Against anyone else, I don't

528
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,831
know how good his chances are,

529
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,499
and I think he knows that, so

530
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,168
Courtney to me is more

531
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,836
dangerous now than having Terry

532
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,212
around.

533
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,380
So I just want to get rid of

534
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,007
Courtney as soon as I possibly

535
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,092
can, and then go from there.

536
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,014
Oh, damn, they're getting out

537
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,348
again.

538
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,391
(yelling)

539
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,185
Jump!

540
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,731
>> You do?

541
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:45,981
>> Yeah.

542
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,983
>> With what?

543
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,567
>> With...

544
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,193
>> A fishing pole?

545
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,194
>> Yeah, where is the hook?

546
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,488
Oh, I see it.

547
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,322
All right.

548
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,158
I'll be back with fish.

549
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,494
(laughing)

550
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,038
I figure how hard can it be?

551
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,248
I've fished before when I was

552
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,625
younger with my dad with a

553
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,585
standard fishing pole.

554
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,878
So I figure, well, everyone

555
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,962
else has tried it.

556
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,048
Let me try it.

557
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,636
Oh, gosh, sorry, snail.

558
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,553
Yuck!

559
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,097
This is so gross!

560
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,390
I need a bigger rock.

561
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,895
(yelling)

562
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,399
Sorry.

563
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,620
Oh! I think I got a fish!

564
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,748
It's going! It's going!

565
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh, no!

566
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:46,500
What's that?

567
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,670
Is that a puffer?

568
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,171
What is that?

569
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,299
Shane is going to be so happy.

570
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,384
I'm scared it's going to come

571
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,469
off!

572
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,307
I can't touch it.

573
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,685
Hold still.

574
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:08,438
Don't move! Don't move!

575
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,775
Wait till I can get...

576
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,319
Somebody needs to help me.

577
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,488
Dead yet?

578
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,574
Damn!

579
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,793
♪ Happy birthday to you

580
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,213
Happy birthday to you. ♪

581
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,966
>> Unbelievable.

582
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,259
How did that happen?

583
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,970
>> I was so happy.

584
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,264
I was so, so happy to have

585
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,765
caught a fish, especially a

586
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,267
fish that big, and it's Shane's

587
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,643
birthday.

588
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,561
>> Unbelievable!

589
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,478
>> Happy birthday.

590
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,105
>> I'm so proud of you!

591
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,648
>> To see the look on Shane's

592
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,442
face, it was priceless,

593
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,818
priceless.

594
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,945
>> Cirie Fields caught the

595
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,155
biggest fish out here, the girl

596
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,282
from Jersey.

597
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,533
Captain America has been

598
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,826
swimming around for three

599
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,703
weeks, nothing.

600
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,332
How great is that?

601
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,335
>> Oh, here they come!

602
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,045
>> When we returned from our

603
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:13,587
reward, we got a pleasant

604
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,174
surprise.

605
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,467
>> I caught a fish, girl!

606
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:18,759
>> You did?

607
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,345
>> Wow! Awesome, Cirie!

608
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,346
>> You speared it?

609
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,765
>> No, I just fished with the

610
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,682
little thing.

611
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,142
Who would've thunk Cirie could

612
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,185
catch a fish?

613
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,895
That's the joy in waiting for

614
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,230
them to see the fish, for<i> me.</i>

615
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,691
(laughs)

616
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,317
I love it, love it, love it,

617
00:20:35,400 --> 00:21:09,935
love it.

618
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,812
>> Right, right, I agree.

619
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,437
Danielle asked me about, "Well,

620
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,690
if you win, who are you going

621
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,524
to take to the finals?"

622
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,566
You know, "Are you going to take

623
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,192
Courtney?

624
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,026
Because it might be easier for

625
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,652
you to win the million if you

626
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,654
took her."

627
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,780
To be honest with you, if I had

628
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,489
my druthers, I would take

629
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,658
Courtney to the finals, and I'm

630
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,784
sure Danielle would take

631
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,078
Courtney to the finals.

632
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,964
>> I know.

633
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,737
>> I want to make sure that

634
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,238
we're going into this agreement

635
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,364
in a very fair way, so final

636
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,743
three challenge is, top two

637
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,661
finishers go to the finals.

638
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,163
And-and I'm all for that.

639
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:11,788
You got to beat the best and be

640
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,623
the best.

641
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,444
>> It was extremely insulting

642
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,988
to me when she said, you know,

643
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,656
"I don't want to have someone

644
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,407
being carried in here."

645
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,867
And she didn't even see that,

646
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,701
you know?

647
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,994
I was, like, "Do you underst..."

648
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:51,578
Like, of course I'm going to

649
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,954
be mad.

650
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:53,580
Who are you speaking to right

651
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,040
now?

652
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,042
"Someone being carried in."

653
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:57,667
You're referring to me, because

654
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,837
I'm the easiest one to beat.

655
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,863
>> What is she talking about?

656
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,866
Um... whoever wins what?

657
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,826
I don't know, I've lost that

658
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,701
part.

659
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,911
>> If Terry came in first...

660
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,246
>> Mm-hmm. Whoever came in

661
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:34,871
second should be the person he'd

662
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,331
take?

663
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,958
>> Yeah.

664
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,126
>> Of course he would tell you

665
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:39,751
that, because if you look at the

666
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,003
three of us, who do you think is

667
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,756
going to come in second?

668
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,841
Since their little thing

669
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,634
yesterday, Danielle... they done

670
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,803
brainwashed her, and I keep

671
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,429
trying to point out to her, she

672
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,473
wants to go with Terry and

673
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,558
Courtney and myself, which, of

674
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,102
course, I'll be number four.

675
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,604
Come on, now, I'm not stupid.

676
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,314
But why would you want to take

677
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,649
her with us and give her first

678
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,526
or second place?

679
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,319
I keep... I don't know why she

680
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,699
can't see that.

681
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,491
If we take away the person he

682
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,452
wants to take second, he doesn't

683
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,829
have to know who we're gonna

684
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,413
vote.

685
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,664
He can think we're going to

686
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,999
vote Aras.

687
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,001
You can't let him dictate what

688
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,544
y'all should do, and that's

689
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,045
basically what he's doing:

690
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,005
"No, go with me, and then I'll

691
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,007
see who I decide who I want...

692
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,341
I'll take second, maybe the

693
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,759
most athletic, but nine times

694
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,511
out of ten, I'm going to take

695
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,095
Courtney, because I know I can

696
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,305
beat her.

697
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,639
But I'll tell Danielle, yeah,

698
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,098
that's what we'll do,

699
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,641
whoever is number two, then

700
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,101
that's who I'll take."

701
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:38,643
Yeah, mm-hmm, and I got a

702
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,606
bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.

703
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,027
I want to get rid of Courtney,

704
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,069
like, yesterday.

705
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,612
Some kind of way, Courtney's

706
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,655
going, believe that.

707
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,741
(laughs)

708
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:10,508
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

709
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,885
We'll now bring in Aras,

710
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,470
returning once again from Exile

711
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:18,099
Island.

712
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:18,725
You guys ready to get to today's

713
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,976
challenge?

714
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,810
>> Yeah.

715
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,895
>> PROBST: First things first.

716
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,314
Terry, give it up.

717
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,403
Three individual immunity

718
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,239
challenges, three times Terry's

719
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:32,739
won.

720
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,241
We'll see if that continues

721
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:34,991
today.

722
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:35,700
Once again, immunity is back up

723
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,619
for grabs.

724
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,954
For today's challenge, you are

725
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,206
going to hold your own weight.

726
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,540
Here's how it works.

727
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,042
You are going to each kneel at

728
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,919
the end of a long plank

729
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,420
suspended over a pit of water.

730
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,463
You'll be holding on to two

731
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,714
ropes that are connected to a

732
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:49,923
hook.

733
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,758
Hanging from the hook is weight.

734
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,427
We'll start with 20% of your

735
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,262
body weight.

736
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,930
Every 15 minutes we'll add more

737
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:57,138
weight.

738
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,266
As the weight gets heavier, it

739
00:25:59,349 --> 00:25:59,849
will get harder to hold on to

740
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,393
those ropes.

741
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:01,977
When the weight becomes too

742
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,728
much, the ropes'll slip from

743
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,647
your hands, the platform will

744
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,691
fall, you'll drop into the

745
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:07,899
water.

746
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,693
The last person left standing

747
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,194
wins immunity, guaranteed a

748
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,404
spot in the final five.

749
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,697
Ready to get at it?

750
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,155
>> Yeah.

751
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,198
>> PROBST: All right, weigh in.

752
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,284
Get started.

753
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,537
All right, everybody has their

754
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,038
ropes.

755
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,164
We're going to release the

756
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,082
weight.

757
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,584
Three, two, one.

758
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,303
This challenge is on.

759
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:36,845
You are holding 20% of your

760
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,431
body weight right now.

761
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,890
Shane, Cirie, Aras, Terry

762
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,517
all holding right around 34

763
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,518
pounds.

764
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,102
Danielle and Courtney holding

765
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,104
about 24 pounds.

766
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,149
And we're just getting started.

767
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,176
When we reach 15 minutes, we

768
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,094
will add another ten percent of

769
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:18,762
your body weight, roughly

770
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,556
another 12 to 15 pounds for each

771
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,016
of you.

772
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,767
Shane feeling those ropes

773
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,893
slipping through his hands.

774
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,979
>> I'm not going to make it.

775
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,068
>> PROBST: Shane has lost one

776
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,069
rope.

777
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:34,903
He's down to one rope.

778
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,447
That rope is not coming back.

779
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,031
Shane now holding all of his

780
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,825
weight with one hand.

781
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,122
Shane lets go.

782
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,415
Shane is the first one out of

783
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,751
the challenge.

784
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,965
Okay, it's been 15 minutes.

785
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,384
We're going to add another ten

786
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,843
percent of your body weight to

787
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,803
the hook.

788
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:05,475
Three, two, one.

789
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,017
Everybody has another ten

790
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,936
percent now.

791
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,276
(groans)

792
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,784
>> It's burning my hands, the

793
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,743
rope.

794
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,327
>> PROBST: You guys have made

795
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,829
it 30 days.

796
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,248
Nobody give up.

797
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,793
(grunting)

798
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,004
It's slipping.

799
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,215
>> PROBST: Cirie, second one out

800
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,258
of the challenge.

801
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,592
We are down to four.

802
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,053
Aras, Terry, Danielle and

803
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,139
Courtney.

804
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,476
Aras struggling to get a

805
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,853
different grip.

806
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,277
Danielle struggling to hang on.

807
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,408
Danielle, third one out of the

808
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,576
challenge.

809
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,286
We are now down to three.

810
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,372
Aras, Terry, Courtney holding

811
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,999
30% of your body weight.

812
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,084
(groans)

813
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,964
>> Hold on, Aras.

814
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,226
>> PROBST: Aras just lets go.

815
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,852
Two days on Exile Island, too

816
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,646
tough to overcome.

817
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,857
We are down to two: Terry and

818
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,486
Courtney.

819
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,028
>> He's wavering, honey.

820
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,114
You're going to beat him.

821
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,625
>> PROBST: You've reached 30

822
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,667
minutes.

823
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,210
We're going to add ten more

824
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,754
percent of your body weight.

825
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,465
Three, two, one.

826
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,550
Release.

827
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,891
>> PROBST: You are now both

828
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,435
holding 40% of your body weight.

829
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,812
Terry is holding 68 pounds,

830
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,023
Courtney holding 49 pounds.

831
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,820
Terry digging down deep.

832
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,531
Immunity on the line.

833
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,114
>> Watch your weights, Court.

834
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,032
They're getting close to the

835
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,200
bottom.

836
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,911
>> I know. I know.

837
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,372
>> Hold on, Court.

838
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,081
Hang on, honey, he's failing.

839
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,375
I can see it. He's dying.

840
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,668
>> PROBST: The only way to make

841
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,086
sure you do not get voted out

842
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,379
tonight is to win this

843
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,171
challenge.

844
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,924
>> Hold on, Court.

845
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,260
>> PROBST: Courtney down to one

846
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,011
rope.

847
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,013
(groans)

848
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,271
She can't do it.

849
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,605
Courtney's in the water.

850
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,898
Terry wins his fourth straight

851
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,860
immunity.

852
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,196
Terry, come on over.

853
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,076
For the fourth straight time you

854
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,160
win immunity.

855
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,745
You're the only person to wear

856
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,288
this necklace so far in this

857
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,122
game.

858
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,415
Once again, you're safe at

859
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:15,999
Tribal Council.

860
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,709
For the rest of you, after 30

861
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,419
days, one of you going home

862
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,003
tonight.

863
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:20,420
See you at Tribal.

864
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,796
Grab your stuff.

865
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:22,964
Head on back.

866
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:37,979
>> Oh, I tell you what.

867
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,397
Winning today was awesome.

868
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,190
Somebody from Casaya is going

869
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,318
home tonight, and I think Aras

870
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,944
knows that he's the target, and

871
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,155
he is.

872
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,575
>> Aras is still our biggest

873
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:50,825
threat.

874
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,827
I mean, no one can beat him in

875
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,328
the final.

876
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:53,786
>> Right.

877
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,495
>> He's still, like,

878
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,706
competitive, but at least we're

879
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,042
secure for final four.

880
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,460
>> With me, you, Danielle, and

881
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:00,918
Terry?

882
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,211
>> Yeah, I mean, that's, like,

883
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:02,420
solid.

884
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,464
So we're gonna agree,

885
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,758
you, me, Danielle and Terry all

886
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,050
vote Aras.

887
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,927
And then Aras and Shane are

888
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,137
gonna vote Danielle out.

889
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,221
And we'll pretend like we're

890
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:12,680
voting for Danielle.

891
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,015
>> Yeah, please don't say

892
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:14,849
anything to Shane.

893
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:15,892
>> I won't.

894
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,477
I can deal with it later,

895
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,186
but not now.

896
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:18,686
>> Okay.

897
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,730
>> Cirie and I decided Cirie and

898
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,231
Terry, Danielle and I are all

899
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,358
going to vote for Aras.

900
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,067
Shane thinks that I'm going to

901
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,736
do whatever he says and he wants

902
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,071
me to vote Danielle out, and he

903
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,572
wants Cirie to vote Danielle

904
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:29,947
out.

905
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,324
So I'm going to be dealing with

906
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,200
the wrath of Shane for sure

907
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,036
tonight, and I'm not excited

908
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,038
about it.

909
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:44,087
(whistling)

910
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,963
>> You kicked my ass.

911
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,173
>> I could have kicked your ass.

912
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,132
>> You kicked my ass.

913
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,300
>> But we're working this out

914
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,843
so we're gonna make this a joint

915
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,219
effort, okay?

916
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,179
>> Okay. I'm confident with

917
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,806
Courtney and Danielle and I'm

918
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,058
feeling pretty damn good.

919
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,936
We're going to send Aras home,

920
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,145
and with that, we'll have a

921
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,022
three-to-two advantage, and you

922
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,857
know what?

923
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,152
It's gonna be nice.

924
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,862
>> Yeah.

925
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:15,284
>> What'd you say?

926
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,953
>> Courtney, are you okay?

927
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,578
>> Yeah.

928
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:17,870
>> You sure?

929
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,454
>> I mean, no, nothing's okay.

930
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,373
>> Right, but I mean, this is

931
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,208
the game, that's it, Danielle,

932
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,126
one, two, three, four.

933
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,669
And we each move on one more

934
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,088
spot.

935
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,549
>> Shane wants to take Courtney

936
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,717
to the final two.

937
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,551
He's told me that.

938
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,969
Terry wants to take Courtney to

939
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:33,761
the final two.

940
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,138
That, to me, makes Courtney the

941
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,681
most dangerous person out here.

942
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,725
I want to kind of mess up

943
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,267
Terry's plans and mess up

944
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,602
Shane's plans and hopefully we

945
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,354
get rid of Courtney next, and

946
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,856
then it could possibly give me,

947
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,398
Aras and Danielle a little

948
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,025
more leverage in this game.

949
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,569
I just wanted to make sure you

950
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,945
knew exactly what was going on

951
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:51,988
yesterday.

952
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,698
>> Cirie was quick to fill me

953
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,824
in on the situation.

954
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,450
She really has my back, which

955
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,951
is nice.

956
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,244
She let me know about the

957
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,203
goings-on.

958
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,413
And basically what's going on

959
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,915
now is we're going to vote for

960
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,916
Courtney.

961
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,126
>> But the only way to save you

962
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,586
is to vote Courtney.

963
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,254
But I need to talk to you, too.

964
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,590
>> I'm just trying to see what

965
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,049
would be the best situation for

966
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:12,467
me.

967
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,051
Would I rather be with Terry,

968
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,262
Courtney, Cirie and I, or would

969
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,305
I rather be with Aras, Cirie

970
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,723
and I?

971
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,308
I'm just trying to see what the

972
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,143
best situation for myself would

973
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:22,310
be.

974
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,354
>> Well, anyway, we're gonna

975
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,731
have to keep telling Shane that

976
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,982
we're going to vote you.

977
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,859
I swear to God I won't vote you.

978
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,235
And me, you and Aras vote

979
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,111
Courtney because Shane is

980
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:32,987
gonna vote you.

981
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,031
Terry and Courtney are gonna

982
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,407
vote Aras, and me and you and

983
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,367
Aras are gonna vote Courtney.

984
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,160
Absolutely positive, that's why

985
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,329
you have to let Courtney think

986
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,207
that me, you, her and Terry

987
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,249
are gonna vote Aras.

988
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,460
But if you wouldn't be here

989
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,045
tomorrow, me, you and Aras have

990
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:49,462
to vote Courtney.

991
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,298
I'm hoping Danielle just stays

992
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,216
strong 'cause Danielle gets

993
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,134
real nervous and it's easy to

994
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:55,384
turn her.

995
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,304
I'm hoping she just stays calm

996
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,180
tonight and follows through

997
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,016
with the plan.

998
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,657
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

999
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,828
the members of our jury.

1000
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:27,208
Austin, Sally...

1001
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,543
and Bruce...

1002
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,921
(applause)

1003
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,631
...returning from a brief stay

1004
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,799
in Panama City Hospital.

1005
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:35,383
He'll continue on and be a

1006
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,844
member of our jury from here on

1007
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,010
out.

1008
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,262
Let's talk about the reward

1009
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:39,554
challenge.

1010
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,388
Terry, was there some bonding

1011
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,431
going on between the three of

1012
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:42,598
you?

1013
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,433
>> It was a team bonding, you

1014
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,768
know, because we came together

1015
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,728
as a team, gave us maybe a

1016
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,312
little time to forget the game

1017
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,148
and just dig in on a standard

1018
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,358
beach barbecue.

1019
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,276
So, you know, it was, it was

1020
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,027
awesome.

1021
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,112
>> PROBST: Cirie, when you hear

1022
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,488
Terry say it was nice to put the

1023
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,031
game aside for a little bit, do

1024
00:35:59,115 --> 00:35:59,574
you buy that?

1025
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,783
>> No, please.

1026
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,869
I mean, it's a game.

1027
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,620
And he may want us to think

1028
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,706
that they were just having fun

1029
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,458
and barbecuing, but we all know

1030
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:09,876
better.

1031
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,210
As long as you're here and your

1032
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,962
torch is lit, the game is still

1033
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:13,838
going on.

1034
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,256
>> PROBST: So we get to today's

1035
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,299
immunity challenge, once again,

1036
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,384
Terry wins.

1037
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,302
Four individual challenges,

1038
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,679
Terry's won four times.

1039
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,264
Has anybody started to approach

1040
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,348
you and say, "Hey, let's work

1041
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,225
something out 'cause you seem

1042
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:26,934
unstoppable"?

1043
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,852
>> You know, people aren't

1044
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,436
running up to me going, "Hey,

1045
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,646
T.D., let's do this, let's do

1046
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,355
that," you know?

1047
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,900
This tribe has been pretty damn

1048
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,233
tight.

1049
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,610
So you know what?

1050
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,652
The pressure's up; every

1051
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,695
immunity challenge I got to

1052
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,404
win.

1053
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,239
>> PROBST: So, Aras, Casaya

1054
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,365
still holding strong.

1055
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,450
>> From my perspective, I think

1056
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,534
so.

1057
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,994
I mean, the reality is tonight

1058
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:45,620
someone from Casaya has to go

1059
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,955
home, and I'm fully aware that

1060
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,373
the target is nice and large on

1061
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,750
my back.

1062
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,876
>> PROBST: Let's talk about the

1063
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,294
pros and cons of keeping Aras

1064
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,337
in the tribe.

1065
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,713
On the bad side, you're a

1066
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,130
threat.

1067
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,590
But on the flip side, if Casaya

1068
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,300
is staying strong, you hold the

1069
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,344
best chance of defeating Terry.

1070
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,136
Fair to say?

1071
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,471
>> I think I do have a good

1072
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,805
chance of beating Terry, and do

1073
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,389
people feel comfortable voting

1074
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,475
off the arguably the most

1075
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,894
athletic member of the Casaya

1076
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,478
five?

1077
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,854
I think they have a better

1078
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,897
chance with me.

1079
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,981
>> PROBST: Shane, what do you

1080
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:14,565
base the vote on when you're

1081
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,609
getting rid of one of your own?

1082
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,152
Would it be a mistake at this

1083
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:19,278
point in the game to start

1084
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,321
thinking about who you want to

1085
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,406
take to the final two?

1086
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,699
Is it too early for that?

1087
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,826
>> Tonight, we have to eat one

1088
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,828
of our own, and that's...

1089
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,914
Sounds dramatic, but it's going

1090
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,790
to be dramatic.

1091
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,124
I mean, I know that, like,

1092
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,292
people are running stuff in

1093
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,752
their head about who they might

1094
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:35,795
want to position themselves to

1095
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,045
be around.

1096
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,672
We're going to have to shrink a

1097
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,297
little bit before the path is

1098
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,299
over, for sure.

1099
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:40,841
>> PROBST: How about you,

1100
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,550
Danielle?

1101
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,385
Thoughts through your head

1102
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,886
about this is who I would like

1103
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,471
to sit next to in the final two,

1104
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,430
and this is who I don't want to

1105
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,265
to sit next to?

1106
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,392
>> My brain is, like, about to

1107
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:49,850
explode.

1108
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,185
I can't stop running numbers in

1109
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,770
my head, to be honest with you.

1110
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,397
>> PROBST: Courtney, a couple

1111
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,523
of challenges ago, you took

1112
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,691
a lot of hits.

1113
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,900
>> Please, let's get through...!

1114
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,443
>> PROBST: You were labeled the

1115
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,653
person who wouldn't shut up,

1116
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,154
the most annoying, the biggest

1117
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,114
poseur.

1118
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:03,698
Do you imagine whether people

1119
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,783
would want to take you to final

1120
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,451
two or not take you based on the

1121
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,536
perception of the tribe of who

1122
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,453
you are?

1123
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,872
>> Um, I think that when it

1124
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,791
comes down to who people want to

1125
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,458
take to the final two, I think

1126
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,044
that decision has to be made

1127
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,212
much further down the line.

1128
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,630
I'm not holding onto that

1129
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,131
challenge.

1130
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,382
I don't think anyone else is.

1131
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,175
It's sort of like you're on a

1132
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,344
clean slate.

1133
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,554
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to

1134
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,014
the vote.

1135
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:28,597
Terry has individual immunity.

1136
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,017
Any chance of giving that up to

1137
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,600
someone else?

1138
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,101
>> Negative.

1139
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:32,727
>> PROBST: There is still the

1140
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,477
hidden immunity idol which has

1141
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,354
yet to come into play.

1142
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,106
If it does, you'll let me know

1143
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:37,648
after the votes are read.

1144
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,525
It is time to vote.

1145
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,111
Cirie, you're up.

1146
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,246
>> This is just a strategic

1147
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,122
move.

1148
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,540
I can't settle for third or

1149
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,125
fourth place after the things

1150
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,669
I've heard.

1151
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,260
>> You are the ultimate

1152
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,303
competitor.

1153
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,679
I couldn't have asked for a

1154
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,723
better rival, but you are still

1155
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,184
the #1 threat.

1156
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,569
>> You get to eat as much as

1157
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,238
you want, and I will never yell

1158
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,366
at you again.

1159
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,248
>> You're so beautiful, brother,

1160
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,416
but this is for strategy.

1169
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,209
I'll read the votes.

1170

Courtney.

1176

Courtney.

1184
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,623
You need to grab your torch.

1185
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,793
>> That was a shocker.

1186
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:09,925
>> PROBST: Courtney, the tribe

1187
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,343
has spoken.

1188
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,889
It's time for you to go.

1189
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,691
Well, after tonight's vote, I

1190
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,775
don't think there's any doubt

1191
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,527
that this is now an individual

1192
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:28,736
game.

1193
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,362
Grab your torches.

1194
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,280
Head back to camp.

1195
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,366

1206
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,855
choice.

>> Oh!

1212
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,411
>> I'm just completely shocked

1213
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,496
right now.

1214
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,580
My sisters-- that I

1215
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,291
unfortunately trusted-- turned

1216
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:24,833
on me.

1217
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,377
I guess they saw me a little

1218
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,920
bit too much of a threat for

1219
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,088
going to the final two.

1220
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,631
But that's the way it goes.

1221
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,966
And life goes on from here.

1222
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,050
You know, I'm gonna continue

1223
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,385
to live my dreams and make it

1224
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,680
happen, and that's what matters.
