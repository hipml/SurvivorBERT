00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,252
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,586
<i>Survivor...</i> Gary, Danni and

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,754
Bobby Jon found themselves on

4
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:05,338
the outside of the alliance of

5
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,047
six.

6
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,049
>> If it was the other way

7
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,175
around, they'd be doing the same

8
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:09,384
thing.

9
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,135
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,095
(chuckling)

11
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,638
>> PROBST: So the search for the

12
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,639
hidden immunity idol

13
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,473
intensified.

14
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,099
>> We need the immunity idol

15
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,643
now-- we need it right now.

16
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,769
>> PROBST: At the reward

17
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,478
challenge, the survivors

18
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,313
competed for a variety of meals.

19
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,023
First place, steak and lobster.

20
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:24,983
(gasping)

21
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:25,692
>> Man!

22
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,651
>> PROBST: In addition, the

23
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,277
winner of this challenge gets

24
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,988
one clue to the location of the

25
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,489
hidden immunity idol.

26
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,742
Judd dominated the challenge,

27
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,576
winning the best meal.

28
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,201
>> Wow.

29
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:35,535
>> All right.

30
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,036
>> PROBST: Judd, steak and

31
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,912
lobster.

32
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:38,455
Also, a clue to the hidden

33
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,165
immunity idol.

34
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,416
>> Thank you.

35
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,459
>> PROBST: The next day, Judd

36
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,294
shared the clue with Stephenie.

37
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,503
>> "It's not buried or

38
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,129
concealed, nor directly on the

39
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,756
ground."

40
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,257
>> Gotta be like in a tree.

41
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,050
>> PROBST: And then he lied to

42
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,260
the others about the idol's

43
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,344
possible location.

44
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,888
>> It is totally on the ground.

45
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,222
I don't have a problem lying to

46
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,223
the other guys at all.

47
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,767
That's what the game is about,

48
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,559
man.

49
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,394
>> PROBST: Meanwhile, Jamie's

50
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,228
paranoia annoyed even his

51
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,229
closest allies.

52
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,149
>> He seems like a loose cannon,

53
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,276
and I feel like he can ruin our

54
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,277
entire plan.

55
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,862
>> PROBST: But at the challenge,

56
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,197
Jamie won immunity and calmed

57
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,072
his nerves.

58
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,199
Jamie wins immunity.

59
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,408
>> Good job, Jame!

60
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,242
>> PROBST: Back at camp, the

61
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,203
alliance of six targeted Gary.

62
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,747
>> He's a huge physical threat.

63
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,123
He's just always, like, in game

64
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:22,332
mode.

65
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,250
>> PROBST: Knowing he was in

66
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,627
trouble, Gary continued to

67
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,252
search for the hidden immunity

68
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,254
idol and made an interesting

69
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:28,505
discovery.

70
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,423
>> I think it's pretty amazing

71
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,716
that Judd told everybody the

72
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,051
clue that it's on the ground.

73
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:33,635
I wonder why he's looking in

74
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,011
trees.

75
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,221
There's no doubt in my mind that

76
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,305
Judd's lying.

77
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,848
>> PROBST: When it was time for

78
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,225
the vote at Tribal Council...

79
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,476
If anybody has found the

80
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,143
immunity idol, now is the time

81
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,062
to bring it up.

82
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,230
>> Oh, my God!

83
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,065
Gary...

84
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:47,357
>> Oh, man!

85
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,567
>> PROBST: ...Gary caught his

86
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,319
tribe off-guard when he revealed

87
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,946
that he had found the idol.

88
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,531
With Gary suddenly safe, Bobby

89
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,240
Jon was voted out.

90
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,326
Bobby Jon, the tribe has spoken.

91
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,160
>> Thank you very much.

92
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,496
>> PROBST: Eight are left.

93
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,543
Who will be voted out tonight?

94
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,544

NETWORK TELEVISION

98
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,988

99
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,698
fire, still.

100
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,657
Congratulations, Gar.

101
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,200
>> Gary, where'd you find it?

102
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,201
>> Hey, thanks, man.

103
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,286
>> Where did you find it?

104
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,829
>> At the, uh, Mayan worship

105
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,455
ciba tree.

106
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,207
I went to Tribal Council, and I

107
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,751
had found the small immunity

108
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,502
idol in the woods, and they had

109
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,462
to change their votes, because

110
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,881
they couldn't vote for me.

111
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,506
>> Oh, my God.

112
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,382
>> Did you... did you find it on

113
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:42,847
the first day or more recently?

114
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,599
>> Where's the trees the Maya

115
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,850
used to worship at?

116
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,893
>> I don't know.

117
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,227
>> I think Gary is shady.

118
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:48,811
Everybody else thinks he's a

119
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,605
good guy, but I don't think he

120
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,649
really is.

121
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,370
>> I don't care.

122
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,996
It's one vote.

123
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,747
Whoop-di-doodle.

124
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,248
Every time we get back from

125
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,792
Tribal Council, Jamie picks some

126
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,501
kind of argument with somebody.

127
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,795
He came to me and said, "You

128
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,296
know who wrote your name down?"

129
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,589
And I'm like, "Well, yeah, Gary

130
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,632
wrote my name down."

131
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,133
He just is trying to make me

132
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,176
have some kind of bitter

133
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,219
feelings towards Gary when I

134
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:21,469
didn't.

135
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,763
And then it seemed like he was

136
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,139
mad at me because I wasn't

137
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,641
getting mad.

138
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,684
>> I'm not playing into

139
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,017
anybody's game.

140
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,852
>> I got one vote. Whoop-di-doo.

141
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,478
>> Yeah, how's that playing into

142
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,105
somebody's game?

143
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,064
>> I don't even care.

144
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,149
It's like I don't care.

145
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,567
He doesn't even think before he

146
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,902
starts an argument, and then ten

147
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:38,945
minutes later, he starts talking

148
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:39,862
to Gary.

149
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,197
None of it made sense whatsoever

150
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,156
to anybody.

151
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,199
>> Well, Gary would lie when...

152
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,450
I tell you we were voting for

153
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,451
Brandon, he goes, "Yeah, you'll

154
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,703
vote for Brandon, too, and then

155
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,745
you'd vote for me?"

156
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,663
Was that a lie?

157
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,956
>> That'd be a lie that I

158
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,540
told... I never told you I was

159
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,499
voting for Brandon.

160
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,501
>> But I thought I told you

161
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,752
right here that I was like,

162
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,004
"We're voting for Brandon."

163
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:56,629
And you said... you said, uh...

164
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,506
"Okay, whatever," you said,

165
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,340
"Yeah, well, that's fine."

166
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,717
You'll vote for Brandon and then

167
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,718
you vote against me.

168
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,593
>> I don't think so.

169
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,636
>> Obviously, me and you are

170
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,887
going to have to fight this

171
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,596
whole thing now.

172
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,723
>> We don't need to fight.

173
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,348
I'm just...

174
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:07,890
>> Well, obviously, 'cause

175
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,392
you're calling me a liar and I

176
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,268
don't like it.

177
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:10,852
>> I did not just call you a

178
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,270
liar.

179
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,438
Maybe you just don't hear very

180
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:13,646
well.

181
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,356
>> I didn't really hear anybody

182
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,815
say you lied, though.

183
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,608
What are you talking about?

184
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,609
>> I know I'm just saying...

185
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,902
Dude, let's just drop it.

186
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,820
No one said I lied.

187
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,404
>> Jamie and Gary had a little

188
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,823
fall-out, because I guess Jamie

189
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,950
thinks Gary is a liar somehow.

190
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,452
I-I don't... I didn't see Gary

191
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,536
lying.

192
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,412
I-I think Jamie sometimes, he

193
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,331
just says things because he says

194
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,791
it.

195
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,834
>> Seriously, though, Gary, I

196
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,918
really thought, you know, you

197
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,128
said what you said, you know?

198
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,171
>> You know, Jamie, you're gonna

199
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,255
think what you want to think,

200
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:39,964
okay?

201
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,007
>> Yeah, and you're going to

202
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,216
think what you want to think.

203
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,009
>> You got that right.

204
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:43,926
>> Come on, Jamie, forget about

205
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,677
it.

206
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,887
>> I'll forget about it, but I'm

207
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,721
mad, too, Gary.

208
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,472
Don't worry about it.

209
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:47,847
>> What's that?

210
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,432
>> I'm mad, too, just like you.

211
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:49,766
>> I'm not mad.

212
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,517
>> I don't think he's mad

213
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:51,851
either, Jame.

214
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm... I don't know.

215
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,437
>> I'm just gonna drop it.

216
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,646
>> It just seems like you're

217
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,606
starting to instigate...

218
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,482
>> Just drop it.

219
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:57,982
>> All right. Good, man.

220
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,776
That's what I want you to do,

221
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,902
man-- I don't think he's mad.

222
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:01,736
Emotionally, I guess this game

223
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,279
might be taking a toll on him,

224
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,238
and he really, psychologically,

225
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,239
he's losing it.

226
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,827
(chuckles)

227
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,913
(roars)

228
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:32,058
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

229
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,684
And then there were eight.

230
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,186
Four men, four women.

231
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,355
Today's challenge is for reward.

232
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,523
Here's how it works.

233
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,607
You will be divided into two

234
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,442
teams-- one pair of men, one

235
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,195
pair of women on each team.

236
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,280
Each pair will be attached by a

237
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:46,948
rope.

238
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,491
Moving one pair at a time, you

239
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,201
will race through a deep mud

240
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,577
pit, as well as a series of

241
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,995
obstacles.

242
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,789
You'll go over the first

243
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,375
obstacle, under the second, over

244
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,751
the third obstacle.

245
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,087
At the end, you'll find pots

246
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,546
filled with corn.

247
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,674
Grab a pot and head back over

248
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,217
the same obstacles.

249
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,718
Once you make it back to your

250
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,594
mat, empty your corn into your

251
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,055
finished pot while the other

252
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,848
pair heads out.

253
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,640
The first tribe to fill their

254
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,976
pot to the white line wins

255
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,893
reward.

256
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,519
Want to know what you're playing

257
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,104
for?

258
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:18,938
>> Oh, yeah.

259
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,773
>> PROBST: The winning team will

260
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,566
leave here via helicopter.

261
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,402
You'll be taken to a beautiful

262
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,028
private home, get a shower.

263
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,612
(squeals)

264
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,406
And wash your clothes.

265
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,991
Then pajamas, because you're

266
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,200
spending the night.

267
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,077
In the morning, you'll awake to

268
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,163
the smell of Folgers coffee.

269
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,372
>> Ooh, my gosh.

270
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,249
>> PROBST: Reenergize you,

271
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:38,875
rejuvenate you for these last

272
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,334
few days.

273
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:40,710
Worth playing for?

274
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,295
>> Yes.

275
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,337
>> PROBST: Let's draw for teams

276
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,382
and get started.

277
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,804
All right, we have our two

278
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,638
teams.

279
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,349
Jamie and Rafe, Cindy and Lydia

280
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,518
taking on Gary and Judd, Steph

281
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,728
and Danni.

282
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,897
For reward, survivors ready?

283
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,647
Go!

284
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,732
>> Come on, guys!

285
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,608
Come on, guys!

286
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,609
Good job. Good job. Good job.

287
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,360
Together, together.

288
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,486
>> PROBST: Both guys heading

289
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:07,945
over at the same time.

290
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,072
>> Nice!

291
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,449
>> PROBST: Got to go under the

292
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,116
second obstacle.

293
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,117
Jamie dives right in.

294
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,035
Rafe dives in.

295
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,578
Gary and Judd, everybody

296
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,537
getting muddy.

297
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,664
Jamie and Rafe with a bit of a

298
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,458
lead.

299
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,919
Getting to their first pot of

300
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,879
corn and heading back.

301
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,548
Judd and Gary right behind them.

302
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,800
Now is where strategy comes in.

303
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,844
Gonna have to work together.

304
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,012
Rafe over first.

305
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,931
Jamie hands the pot to him.

306
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,140
Judd over first.

307
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,267
Gary hands the pot to him and

308
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,227
loses some corn.

309
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,228
>> Watch the corn.

310
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:40,811
>> PROBST: Rafe and Jamie with

311
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,314

>> Guys.

>> PROBST: Gary and Judd, trying

314
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,277

>> PROBST: Rafe and Jamie

317
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,405

Go.

319
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,366
>> Go, Lydia, Lydia!

>> PROBST: Cindy and Lydia on

321
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,159

00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,497
>> Come on, come on, Gary.

325
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,081

out.

328
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,168
They've got some time to make

329
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,336
up.

330
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:05,920
Cindy and Lydia clearing the

331
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,964

the second pot, trudging through

337
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:18,808
the mud.

338
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,559
>> Come on, girls.

339
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,185
>> PROBST: They've got a decent

340
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,436

>> Keep going, guys.

345
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,280
You're doing well.

That pot is heavy.

349
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,910
>> Come on, come on, come on.

350
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,911

Lydia struggling.

354
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,208
That mud is deep!

355
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,376
>> Lydia, come on.

356
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,002
>> Come on, come on, come on,

357
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,295

>> You can do it, Lydia.

361
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,132
You can do it.

362
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,591
>> PROBST: Lydia has got to

363
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,010
touch the mat before you can go.

364
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:54,802
Danni and Steph have taken over.

365
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,346
They're passing Lydia with their

366
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,264
second pot.

367
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,223
Go!

368
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,726
Gary and Judd now with the lead.

369
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,977
Lydia really slow.

370
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,686
Go!

371
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,687
>> Good job, good job!

372
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,314
>> PROBST: Jamie and Rafe trying

373
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,606
to make up a lot of time.

374
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,733
Jamie throws himself over.

375
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,650
Rafe right behind.

376
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,526
>> Come on, guys!

377
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,319
>> PROBST: They're moving

378
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,778
quickly, diving under the second

379
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,196
obstacle.

380
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,157
They're making up a lot of time

381
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,741
very fast.

382
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,034
They've tied it up.

383
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,827
We're dead even.

384
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,828
Jamie and Rafe heading back.

385
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,664
Judd and Gary right behind them.

386
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,666
>> Good job, guys, keep moving.

387
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,543
>> PROBST: It's a long race.

388
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,836
Anything could happen.

389
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,798
Can't slow down now.

390
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,966
>> Gary, don't spill any.

391
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,051
>> All right.

392
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:35,843
>> Nice, Gar. Come on, Gar.

393
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,054
>> PROBST: Jamie and Rafe are

394
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,097
back with their third pot.

395
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,891
Touch that mat.

396
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,808
Go, Lydia.

397
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,393
Go, Cindy.

398
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,603
>> Come on, guys.

399
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,020
>> Come on, guys.

400
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,522
>> PROBST: Got to hit the mat,

401
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,357
both of them.

402
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,442
Steph and Danni back out on the

403
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,360
course.

404
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,778
Cindy and Lydia, you're going to

405
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,196
have to move.

406
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,781
Danni and Stephenie now with the

407
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,117
lead.

408
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,203
Lydia really slowing them down.

409
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,954
You're gonna have to move,

410
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,163
Lydia.

411
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,664
Dig deep. Let's go.

412
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,624
>> Keep going, guys.

413
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,166
>> One, two, three, jump.

414
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,210
>> PROBST: One more pot of corn

415
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:09,919
might do it for Danni and Steph.

416
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,296
>> All right, we only need one

417
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,005
more.

418
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,006
>> One more.

419
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,966
>> PROBST: They've got their pot

420
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,509
and they're heading back.

421
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,009
Lydia still struggling.

422
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:17,927
>> I can't get my feet up.

423
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,346
>> Go, Danni.

424
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,389
>> PROBST: A big reward at

425
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,223
stake.

426
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,474
>> That's your job.

427
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,309
>> PROBST: Night away from camp.

428
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,644
Food, clean clothes.

429
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,646
Cindy and Lydia not quitting.

430
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,939
Let's go, women. Move!

431
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,607
Danni and Steph with...

432
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,024
Steph falls down.

433
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,859
Gotta get that corn in there to

434
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,903
count.

435
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,155
Will it be enough?

436
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,073
Yes!

437
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:39,824
(screaming)

438
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,535
Danni, Steph, Gary, Judd win

439
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,204
reward.

440
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,163
>> Good job!

441
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,498
We're still going to finish.

442
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,082
We're still going to finish.

443
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,792
Let's go.

444
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,835
>> It's a done deal.

445
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,043
>> Oh!

446
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:51,752
>> Let's finish.

447
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,839
>> It's just worth doing right.

448
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,093
>> We're not quitting.

449
00:11:59,176 --> 00:11:59,927
Let's... come on!

450
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,886
Come on, let's go.

451
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,304
>> They already won, Jamie.

452
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:02,930
There's nothing we can do about

453
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,515
it.

454
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,641
>> Okay, fine.

455
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,018
(speaking indistinctly)

456
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:15,901
>> PROBST: You guys ready?

457
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,777
>> Yeah.

458
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,029
>> PROBST: Hit it.

459
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,023
>> Guys, day 25 is the best day

460
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:54,231
so far.

461
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:54,982
>> We're covered in mud.

462
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,193
>> One of the best days of my

463
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:57,860
life.

464
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,194
>> Me, too.

465
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:58,861
>> Just to get away from camp

466
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,987
was enough.

467
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,490
It was my first time actually in

468
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,824
a helicopter, so that was an

469
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,117
awesome experience in itself.

470
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,000
>> We're going to a mansion, you

471
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:13,209
guys.

472
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,002
How weird is it going to feel

473
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,795
being in a bathroom and looking

474
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,796
in the mirror?

475
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,881
>> Oh, that's right, the mirror.

476
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,340
>> I don't need that.

477
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,841
I don't want to look.

478
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,261
>> Oh, you guys, how amazing.

479
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,483
>> Oh, this is so beautiful!

480
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,567
>> Hi!

481
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:38,859
>> Hey!

482
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,653
We're home!

483
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,654
>> Greetings. Welcome.

484
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,738
>> The helicopter dropped us off

485
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,073
not too far from the house, and

486
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,407
you were greeted by this dude,

487
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,367
Louie.

488
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,992
>> This is my house, and this is

489
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,744
your<i> casa.</i>

490
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,079
>> We were filthy, man, full of

491
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,163
mud.

492
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,706
>> Okay, look at the pool.

493
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,124
>> Oh, look at the food.

494
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,376
(yelling)

495
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,335
>> Oh, nice.

496
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,671
>> This pool is unbelievable!

497
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,006
>> He took us down to the pool

498
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,094
area, where we all showered up.

499
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,178
>> Eww!

500
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,514
(giggling)

501
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,432
>> I would not have rather gone

502
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,226
on that reward with any other

503
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,144
people than those three that I

504
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,104
was with.

505
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,565
>> Two hot girls getting in the

506
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,607
shower together.

507
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,900
>> I-I wouldn't go that far, not

508
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,150
right now.

509
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,069
Danni and I are, like, really

510
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:22,278
similar.

511
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,988
She's a cool chick.

512
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:24,863
(screaming)

513
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,240
And Gary is just an awesome,

514
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:26,532
genuine guy.

515
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,534
And Judd and I have been buds

516
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,034
since the day I met him.

517
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,036
>> I'm just taking all my

518
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,079
clothes off, everything.

519
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:32,329
>> Really?

520
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,581
>> Yep.

521
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,623
(bird cawing)

522
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,165
>> What are you doing, Judd?

523
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,750
(giggling)

524
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,876
>> It's all right.

525
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,877
It's coming off.

526
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,545
(laughing)

527
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,255
>> It was definitely the best

528
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,090
foursome out here that I could

529
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,925
have gone on this most amazing

530
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,884
reward with.

531
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,720
This is more like very fancy

532
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,679
hors d'oeuvres.

533
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,430
Oh, lobster.

534
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,514
>> There you go.

535
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,140
>> Oh, it's a jalapeño!

536
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,141
We ate so much!

537
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,518
Oh, there's a lot of meat in

538
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,185
here.

539
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,062
Did I do well, or am I missing

540
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,981
out, like still on a bunch of

541
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,857
it?

542
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,609
>> No, you're doing good.

543
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,319
>> I love to eat, but Stephenie

544
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,695
eats even more than I do.

545
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,362
>> Whoa!

546
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,572
>> It's good, isn't it?

547
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,157
I haven't had a chance to get

548
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,908
to know her, and I think the

549
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,326
reward helps a lot.

550
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,077
I do feel bad that they're

551
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:12,995
back there.

552
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,747
>> Lydia, she was so down on

553
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,332
herself, I can't even imagine

554
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,541
today how she feels.

555
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,126
>> Oh...

556
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,128
>> My sincere apologies to you

557
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,130
guys, though, man.

558
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,548
You guys were ahead.

559
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,550
You and Jamie were ahead of-of

560
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,052
Gary and Judd.

561
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:28,344
You were!

562
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,721
>> Yeah, but i-it doesn't

563
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,639
matter, Lydia.

564
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,307
>> A bath, a nice bath and

565
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,183
coffee in the morning and

566
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,018
pancakes with syrup.

567
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,561
>> I don't need to hear it.

568
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,103
>> And a helicopter ride.

569
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,564
>> Yeah, I'm a little sad about

570
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,023
the helicopter ride.

571
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,777
(laughing)

572
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,626
>> I know we can get there if

573
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,210
you just... if you... if you

574
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,670
trust me.

575
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,754
You know what I'm saying?

576
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,963
>> Okay. I feel good about that,

577
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:05,881
then.

578
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,383
>> Well, can you swear like...

579
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,967
we'll go to the final three

580
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:09,677
together?

581
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,302
Because I will give you my word,

582
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,054
and I know I can pull it.

583
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:12,930
>> I don't know.

584
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,014
Like, I don't feel good about

585
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,432
giving you my word as a man if

586
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,558
I'm not like 100% on it.

587
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,643
Do you know what I mean?

588
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,977
>> Yeah, yeah, why aren't you

589
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:19,937
100% about it? Like...

590
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,479
>> Well, because I haven't

591
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,188
thought about it at all.

592
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,147
>> You think about it.

593
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,441
>> Yeah, let me... 'Cause I-I...

594
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,901
You know, I'm not just going to

595
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,152
sit here and swear to you after,

596
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,278
like, five minutes of thinking

597
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,029
about it.

598
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,114
>> Yeah, yeah.

599
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,115
>> I've almost given up trying

600
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,116
to understand Jamie's strategy

601
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,743
in this game.

602
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,745
I think that Jamie is just kind

603
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,747
of losing it, almost, in terms

604
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,498
of paranoia.

605
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,207
Like he's just letting the game

606
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,668
really, really get to him, and

607
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,794
he is constantly freaked out.

608
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,420
>> Here, I'll make an easy swear

609
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,963
for you.

610
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,588
Do you want to just swear the

611
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,006
top six right now?

612
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,632
>> I already have.

613
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,216
>> Okay, well I...

614
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,260
>> I already told you yesterday.

615
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,309
>> I won't sucker you.

616
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,354
Yeah. (chuckles)

617
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,447
>> I feel like my family at

618
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,239
Christmas-- we're all wearing

619
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,157
the same pajamas.

620
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,325
>> What a great feeling.

621
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,077
It's just like, just rejuvenated

622
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,912
me and everybody else with me.

623
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,664
There's no doubt that this would

624
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,249
be a good time to try and make

625
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,417
some ties with Stephenie and

626
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,334
Judd.

627
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,294
If they shut me down, they shut

628
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,337
me down.

629
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,964
But, uh, I've got to try because

630
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,299
I'm the next to go if-if they

631
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,634
don't change.

632
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,264
>> Okay.

633
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,101
>> Hard question.

634
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,352
>> My whole thing with you...

635
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,228
>> Mm-hmm.

636
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,897
>> ...and my whole thing with

637
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,356
Danni has been I want to take

638
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,733
the strongest four to the final

639
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,650
four...

640
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,234
>> Yeah.

641
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,235
>> ...so nobody slides by...

642
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,737
>> Right, and he said that since

643
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,404
day one.

644
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,947
>> ...with-with good attitudes,

645
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,490
that work hard in camp and

646
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,450
that are great competitors.

647
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,993
The play was, "Hey, I want the

648
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:58,535
best in the finals so you're

649
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,162
winning against the best."

650
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,538
And I-I don't know what they're

651
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,331
thinking.

652
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,957
But, uh, all's I could do is

653
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,750
plant a seed.

654
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,375
If Lydia goes to the final two,

655
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,168
guess who's winning?

656
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,795
>> She'll win.

657
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,378
>> She'll win.

658
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,171
>> Lydia.

659
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:09,505
>> Of course.

660
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,130
>> We know that.

661
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,424
>> If Cindy goes to the final

662
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,592
two, guess who's winning? Cindy.

663
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,676
>> We know that.

664
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,969
>> And-And do they deserve it?

665
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:16,553
>> I'm fine with that logic--

666
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,305
like to be the best, beat the

667
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,181
best.

668
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,599
But then at the same time, I

669
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,767
have such a good thing going.

670
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,559
It's kind of iffy.

671
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,769
So I'm not... really not sure

672
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,103
if we're going to go with that.

673
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:25,562
But it's a good idea.

674
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,271
>> Let me ask you this, then.

675
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,272
In a perfect world...

676
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,190
>> Yeah.

677
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,108
>> ...numbers aside, in this

678
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:30,651
game who would be the next

679
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,236
person you guys would want to

680
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,153
vote out?

681
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,279
>> There's no doubt who I'd vote

682
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,197
out.

683
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,572
>> Me, too. Jamie.

684
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,949
>> Well, who would it be?

685
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:37,866
>> Jamie.

686
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,909
>> Because of his attitude?

687
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,952
>> Yeah.

688
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:40,953
>> Oh, yeah.

689
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,329
>> Bonding with Gary and Danni

690
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,997
is not going to affect my game,

691
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,249
because I know what my game plan

692
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,583
is.

693
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,876
But it's nice to get to know

694
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,710
somebody different who you

695
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,545
never met before.

696
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,254
>> I love Guatemala right now.

697
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,674
(chuckling)

698
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,800
>> Good night, Judd.

699
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,634
>> Good night, Gary.

700
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,301
Good game, man.

701
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,177
>> Yeah. You, too.

702
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,846
>> Sometimes this game affects

703
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,097
your heart a little bit.

704
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,723
Sometimes it kind of wrenches it

705
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,391
a bit.

706
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,642
And getting rid of those two

707
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,977
is... you know, that's gonna be

708
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,894
a little heart-wrenching.

709
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,229
But that's just the way the game

710
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,397
is, man.

711
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,189
If I want to go further in this

712
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,234
game, the threats gotta go.

713
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,329
>> Ooh, Nelly!

714
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,831
Smell that, baby?

715
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,665
>> So good!

716
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,332
>> Oh!

717
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,292
>> Oh, look at that, man!

718
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,335
>> Oh, my gosh.

719
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,212
>> When we got up this morning,

720
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,339
we could smell coffee.

721
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,883
It was so refreshing to smell

722
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,384
coffee, rather than the smell of

723
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,136
the jungle every morning when we

724
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:39,761
get up.

725
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,596
>> It's all crystally.

726
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,097
>> (squeals): So exciting!

727
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,390
>> Oh, you're a big coffee fan,

728
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:43,640
Dan, huh?

729
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,893
>> Well, I drink it a lot in the

730
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,060
mornings when I have early

731
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:47,728
mornings.

732
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,271
There was like six different

733
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,772
flavors of Folgers coffee.

734
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,732
And we tried all of them.

735
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,442
>> Oh, my God!

736
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,235
Oh, let's sit down.

737
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,236
>> Oh, man!

738
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,696
>> Where do you want to sit?

739
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,447
Hey!

740
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,324
>> What's up?

741
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:00,616
>> Louie!

742
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,241
>> Good morning.

743
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,409
>> What's going on?

744
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,452
>> Actually, I'm bringing a

745
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,244
little present.

746
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,079
>> Okay.

747
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:06,830
>> Oh!

748
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,956
>> Enjoy it.

749
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,874
>> Thank you very much.

750
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:09,625
>> Thank you.

751
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,001
>> Thank you, Louie.

752
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,085
>> Look like videotapes.

753
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,211
>> Stop it.

754
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,212
>> Mm-mmm.

755
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,464
>> Oh, my God!

756
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,715
>> Are they?

757
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,800
>> Oh, my God!

758
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,427
>> Lou, our little buddy, comes

759
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,803
over and gives us a present.

760
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,471
Open it up, it's videotapes from

761
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,348
home.

762
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,390
>> Stephenie.

763
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,391
>> I told my family I wouldn't

764
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,392
cry.

765
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,519
>> If we didn't get any food or

766
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,854
shower or nothing and just got

767
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,105
the videotapes, I would have

768
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,231
been completely satisfied.

769
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:33,815
It was just the icing on the

770
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,068
cake.

771
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,236
>> Well, I'm at Grandma's...

772
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,946
>> Hey!

773
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,947
>> ...and I love you.

774
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,615
>> Then the tapes come out.

775
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,616
Ooh! That was sweet.

776
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,325
>> I'm cooking up some hot dogs.

777
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,326
>> Oh, no.

778
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,078
(thud)

779
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,121
>> Whoa, hey, easy there.

780
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,164
>> Hi, honey.

781
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:49,498
>> Oh, my gosh

782
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,584
>> I miss you very, very much.

783
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,253
Life is very, very, very boring

784
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:55,879
without you.

785
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,714
>> My wife, my daughter, my mom,

786
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,465
my nieces, my sister and my

787
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,341
brother-in-law.

788
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,593
>> We miss you, but...

789
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,595
have a nice cold beer and a fat

790
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,514
T-bone waiting for you when you

791
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,473
get home.

792
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,975
>> Better than steak and eggs

793
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,435
any morning, man.

794
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,104
(howls)

795
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,313
(screams and laughter)

796
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,691
>> Hi, Danni, it's your mom, of

797
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,692
course.

798
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,484
I love you so much.

799
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,528
Boy, do we miss you.

800
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,821
The two most important men in

801
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,072
your life would like to say

802
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,240
hello to you.

803
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:23,991
>> Hondo.

804
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,325
>> Hey, Danni, it's your old

805
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,326
buddy, Hondo.

806
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,370
Boy, I sure miss you.

807
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,871
>> My family, I knew, would be

808
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,248
fine.

809
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,582
I just wanted to see my dogs and

810
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,667
make sure they were okay.

811
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,085
And they look like they've been

812
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,253
well fed, so...

813
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,422
>> I'll be talking to you soon.

814
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,173
Love you, Danni. Bye.

815
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,800
>> Aw...

816
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,427
>> Whoo...

817
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,053
>> Oh...

818
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,680
>> Hi, Aunt Stephenie.

819
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,889
>> How are you?

820
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,933
Hopefully, the bugs aren't

821
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:50,350
biting too bad.

822
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,603
>> And I hope you're all right.

823
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,938
>> Yes, we do.

824
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,731
>> Bye-bye.

825
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,857
(blows kiss)

826
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,566
>> Kisses!

827
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,525
>> Go, Jets.

828
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,360
(shouting)

829
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,320
>> There was four videotapes in

830
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:02,779
there of our families.

831
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,781
We watched the videos and

832
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,033
just had a great time.

833
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,617
I saw everybody else's family,

834
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,827
which was really neat.

835
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,037
'Cause they're always talking

836
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,912
about them.

837
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,289
So now you can connect names

838
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,248
with faces.

839
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:13,915
>> Hey, Dad, hope everything is

840
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,208
going good.

841
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,209
I'm getting ready for

842
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,461
California, and I will talk to

843
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,545
you when you get back.

844
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,130
>> I'm definitely not very good

845
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,506
at this, but I just want to tell

846
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,133
you that I love you and miss you

847
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,259
and we'll see you soon.

848
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:24,760
>> I'm an emotional wreck

849
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,428
anyways when it comes to

850
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,430
anything family.

851
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,182
And not seeing them for 25 days

852
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,516
and then seeing my kids and my

853
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,851
wife, it was phenomenal.

854
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,227
>> Hey, Dad.

855
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:34,603
>> Aw...

856
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,355
>> Hope you haven't got hit in

857
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,899
the head with a coconut yet.

858
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,734
But if you have, hi, my name is

859
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,526
Jamie and I'm your daughter.

860
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,112
>> You got muscles on top of

861
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,947
your muscles and muscles on top

862
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,573
of those muscles...

863
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,575
>> It was the best reward

864
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,995
challenge prize that we possibly

865
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,246
could have had.

866
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,539
>> ...beat you up.

867
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,499
(laughing)

868
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,334
>> Two weeks, you'll be home

869
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,585
in two weeks.

870
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,934
>> Well, we're in the real world

871
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:14,726
now.

872
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,645
>> Yeah, back to the hellhole.

873
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,438
>> Here they come.

874
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,397
>> Hey.

875
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,398
>> Is this them?

876
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,274
>> Hi!

877
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:21,942
>> Hey.

878
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,901
>> Hey, guys.

879
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,568
>> Hey, guys.

880
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,486
>> Welcome back.

881
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,154
>> We didn't bring food, so

882
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:26,613
don't get too excited.

883
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,074
>> We made a little basket of

884
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,575
different coffees, and I was

885
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,660
kind of hiding it.

886
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,245
And I mean Cindy, she's a huge

887
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,579
coffee fan and her eyes just lit

888
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,123
up.

889
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,332
>> Coffee!

890
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:37,666
>> Oh, Cindy!

891
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,459
>> Oh, my gosh!

892
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,462
Stephenie pulls out this basket,

893
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,589
and it's got, like, a dozen or

894
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,632
more little Folgers coffee

895
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,634
singles, like little tea bags.

896
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,262
I just thought that is the most

897
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,763
perfect thing that they could

898
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,556
possibly walk into camp with.

899
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,558
>> We thought you're gonna just

900
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:54,766
flip.

901
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,977
>> I cannot even believe it.

902
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,686
I mean, it could have been a

903
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,021
basket of cookies, it could have

904
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,273
been a basket of rolls,

905
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,190
whatever.

906
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,650
But it was basket of coffee.

907
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:03,984
>> Not a lot.

908
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,486
>> Ooh, you guys smell good.

909
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,405
>> How was... did you get a nice

910
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,489
bed to sleep in?

911
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,532
>> I slept on the floor.

912
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,534
>> You didn't sleep on the bed?

913
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,493
>> The only person I was really

914
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,204
concerned about was Jamie.

915
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,456
I didn't know how he would react

916
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,250
to... to me and Steph going

917
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,043
away, because I didn't want

918
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,129
Jamie to feel like we made any

919
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,089
alliances with Danni or Gary,

920
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,507
which we didn't, so...

921
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,675
It was cool.

922
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,308
>> I know, bud.

923
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,058
What's up, Gary?

924
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:37,976
>> How's it going?

925
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,269
>> Good. How was your...

926
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,103
How was the food?

927
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,146
>> It was all right.

928
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:41,730
>> Good food?

929
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,273
>> You know, I don't know if

930
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,691
it's too late, but Judd really

931
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,650
seemed to have fun.

932
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,027
Danni and Stephenie hit it off

933
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,819
immediately.

934
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,070
I don't know how sincere they

935
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,280
were, but-but I made the pitch

936
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,448
to them.

937
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,073
And they're either going to take

938
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,575
it or they're not.

939
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,910
So, if I don't win immunity

940
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,244
on the next challenge and it

941
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,288
doesn't change, I'll be gone.

942
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:12,385
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

943
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,179
Good morning, guys.

944
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,639
>> Good morning.

945
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,474
>> PROBST: First things first.

946
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,060
Jamie, give it up.

947
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,733
Once again, immunity is back up

948
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,817
for grabs.

949
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,611
Ready to get to the challenge?

950
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,946
Here is how it works.

951
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,906
You will be attached to one long

952
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,824
rope, which is threaded through

953
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,784
three obstacles.

954
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,701
You will have to climb over,

955
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,620
crawl under, maneuver around as

956
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,580
you race through these

957
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:40,830
obstacles.

958
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,250
The first four to the finish

959
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,876
move on to the final round.

960
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,503
For the final round, you will

961
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,754
once again be attached to one

962
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:47,963
rope.

963
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,090
Only this time, the obstacle is

964
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,967
three levels high, and that will

965
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,759
seriously complicate things.

966
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,303
First person to finish wins

967
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:55,595
immunity.

968
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,266
Guarantees themself a one-in-

969
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,561
seven shot at $1 million.

970
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,688
We'll draw for position and

971
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:08,858
we'll get started.

972
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:09,985
Here we go.

973
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,695
For immunity, survivors ready?

974
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,239
Go!

975
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,241
Gary wasting no time.

976
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,659
Rafe doing well.

977
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,160
Cindy right in there.

978
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,413
Danni trailing behind.

979
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,706
Judd having trouble figuring it

980
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,040
out.

981
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,417
He's bringing up the tail.

982
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,710
Lydia throwing herself over this

983
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,961
obstacle.

984
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,754
Does not want to be last again.

985
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,131
Gary the first to move on to the

986
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,382
second obstacle.

987
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:32,966
Cindy and Steph are neck and

988
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,135
neck in second place.

989
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,303
Cindy moves on to second

990
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,387
obstacle.

991
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,596
Steph right behind.

992
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,764
Rafe, Jamie fighting for that

993
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,765
fourth spot.

994
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,601
Rafe now at the second pole.

995
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,438
It's Gary and Cindy, Steph and

996
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,856
Rafe now looking to be the final

997
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,982
four.

998
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,692
I forgot about Danni.

999
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,693
Danni is on the ground, almost

1000
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,364
out of sight.

1001
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,657
Gary has moved on to the third

1002
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,160
stage, the big lead.

1003
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,494
Four people are moving on to the

1004
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:01,786
next round.

1005
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,206
Immunity at stake.

1006
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,833
Cindy having a little trouble

1007
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,585
with the second pole.

1008
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,962
Not as easy as it looks.

1009
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,965
Rafe picking up some ground.

1010
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,218
Danni, Judd, Lydia are falling

1011
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:17,761
out of this competition.

1012
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,597
Jamie has moved on to the third

1013
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,724
stage.

1014
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,767
It's Gary, Rafe and Jamie on the

1015
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,644
last stage.

1016
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,229
Cindy and Steph fighting for

1017
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,230
that fourth spot.

1018
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,024
27 days, taking its toll right

1019
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,317
now.

1020
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,777
Gary still in the lead.

1021
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,196
Judd has given up.

1022
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,364
>> I'm not giving up.

1023
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,907
I'm-I'm trying to figure it out.

1024
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,077
>> PROBST: Steph has moved on to

1025
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,119
the third stage.

1026
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:43,787
Cindy falling out of it.

1027
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,872
She's got to get on to the third

1028
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,083
stage to have a shot.

1029
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:48,875
Gary ran into a bit of an

1030
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,709
obstacle.

1031
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,088
Rafe gaining some time.

1032
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,881
Rafe now in the lead.

1033
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,800
Gary falling back.

1034
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,677
Jamie and Rafe now fighting it

1035
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,970
out.

1036
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,555
Gary trying to figure out where

1037
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,515
he's stuck.

1038
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,724
What happened?

1039
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,809
Things were going smoothly.

1040
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,769
He's not panicking.

1041
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,521
Taking his time.

1042
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,105
Cindy nowhere closer to that

1043
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,273
third stage.

1044
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,026
Rafe is good. He's moving on.

1045
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,945
Three spots left.

1046
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,779
Jamie looking good.

1047
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,365
Steph making some progress.

1048
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,534
But Gary is still stuck.

1049
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,910
Jamie is across.

1050
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,285
He's moving on.

1051
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,995
Rafe and Jamie in this final

1052
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,204
round.

1053
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,081
Cindy moved on to the third

1054
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:28,998
stage.

1055
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,750
Two spots left.

1056
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,752
Gary back on track now.

1057
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,587
Easy to tie yourself up in a

1058
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:34,879
knot.

1059
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,923
Steph moving on to the final

1060
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,049
round.

1061
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,051
One spot left.

1062
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,344
Who's it going to go to?

1063
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,346
Cindy and Gary both want it.

1064
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,597
It's going to be tight.

1065
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:44,973
Cindy is moving.

1066
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,600
Gary in the last leg.

1067
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,893
Cindy right behind.

1068
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,229
It is Cindy and Gary very close.

1069
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,313
Gary hustling to get through

1070
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:52,814
that last leg.

1071
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,983
There it is, Gary and Cindy.

1072
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,277
Cindy moving on to the finals...

1073
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,944
>> Phew!

1074
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,905
>> PROBST: ...edges out Gary.

1075
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,951
It's Cindy, Steph, Jamie and

1076
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:05,994
Rafe for immunity.

1077
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,996
Survivors ready?

1078
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,581
Go!

1079
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,623
>> Come on, girls.

1080
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,749
>> PROBST: You now have three

1081
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,876
levels gonna have to climb up,

1082
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,711
back down.

1083
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,171
Cindy takes a fall.

1084
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,714
Steph, throwing herself through

1085
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,047
the challenge.

1086
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,301
First person to finish gets the

1087
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,178
immunity necklace and is safe at

1088
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,598
tonight's Tribal Council.

1089
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:29,893
Cindy and Rafe, dead even.

1090
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,020
When Cindy starts to move, she

1091
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,938
flies.

1092
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,898
Steph close behind.

1093
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,150
Jamie trying to get back into

1094
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,651
it; he's figured it out now.

1095
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,695
Cindy now with a bit of a lead.

1096
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,033
Rafe right behind, not giving

1097
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,328
up, still very tight.

1098
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,747
One slip-up can cost you.

1099
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,749
Cindy moving quickly.

1100
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,126
She's into the fourth section.

1101
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,753
Rafe slowing down.

1102
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,879
It's Cindy's to lose now.

1103
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,965
Rafe trying to make up some

1104
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:01,841
time.

1105
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,260
Cindy flying through this

1106
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,470
obstacle.

1107
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,931
Rafe fighting to stay in it.

1108
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,683
It's Cindy and Rafe right now,

1109
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,560
immunity on the line.

1110
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,687
Cindy is stuck.

1111
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,897
Cindy has lost her lead.

1112
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,942
Cindy now picks up.

1113
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,360
Once again, it's going to be a

1114
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,611
close finish.

1115
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,904
Cindy and Rafe.

1116
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,782
Rafe... wins immunity!

1117
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,074
(applause)

1118
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,493
>> Good job.

1119
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,371
>> Thanks, guys.

1120
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:34,874
>> PROBST: Rafe, come on over.

1121
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,711
>> Good job, Rafe.

1122
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,881
>> PROBST: Rafe is safe tonight

1123
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,508
at Tribal Council.

1124
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,884
One of you seven is going home.

1125
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,218
Back to camp.

1126
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:45,927
See you tonight at Tribal

1127
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,639
Council.

1128
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,741
>> Good job, Rafe.

1129
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,075
>> Thank you.

1130
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,952
>> Good job, Rafe.

1131
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:11,828
>> It's crazy.

1132
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,288
Of the three immunities I have

1133
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,872
competed in, I've won two and

1134
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,374
finished second in one of them.

1135
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,875
Um... you know, I just made

1136
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,210
myself a huge threat in this

1137
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:19,919
game.

1138
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,754
And I think I am going to have

1139
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,131
to change the way I am playing.

1140
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,757
>> I got stuck, I couldn't fit

1141
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,800
my shoulders through.

1142
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:27,051
>> Well, you're-you're tall.

1143
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:27,427
>> I got stuck.

1144
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,304
>> I would've thought it would

1145
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,763
have been terrible for you.

1146
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,764
>> I didn't win immunity

1147
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,348
challenge.

1148
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,891
I was way out in the lead and

1149
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,268
couldn't get my body through a

1150
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,270
little hole.

1151
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,563
So, that was tough.

1152
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,273
But I gave it my best shot.

1153
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,691
I went out fighting.

1154
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,901
And you never know.

1155
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,740
>> Huh?

1156
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,158
>> Making sure we're all good.

1157
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:50,450
>> Mm-hmm.

1158
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,285
We're going to vote for Gary

1159
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,202
tonight.

1160
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,162
Jamie's just very paranoid.

1161
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,081
I mean, he's not going anywhere.

1162
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,793
He might get maybe...

1163
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,087
one vote, from Gary.

1164
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,048
And that's it.

1165
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,179
>> Oh, yeah.

1166
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,431
>> I mean, I thought it was

1167
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,058
actually a fun challenge, but...

1168
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,225
>> I thought it was good.

1169
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:16,476
>> Yeah.

1170
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,977
>> Freaking workout.

1171
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,354
My legs are killing me right

1172
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:19,520
now.

1173
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:19,979
>> My arms are.

1174
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,773
>> Yeah.

1175
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,357
>> So, I didn't win immunity

1176
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,024
today; Rafe did.

1177
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,902
But he is not the serious threat

1178
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,361
right now; it's Gary.

1179
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,863
And eventually, they're gonna

1180
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:29,447
catch on that I'm the serious

1181
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,198
threat.

1182
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,742
So I'm trying to work it where

1183
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,535
they, uh, keep the six that got

1184
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,537
here together.

1185
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:41,626
And I'm working that card a lot.

1186
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,710
We're still sticking to the

1187
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,002
plan?

1188
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,879
>> As far as I know.

1189
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,047
Haven't heard anything else.

1190
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,674
Is there anything else for me to

1191
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,716
know?

1192
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,176
>> I just... I-I don't want to

1193
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,386
go home tonight.

1194
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,136
I'm sticking with the six, you

1195
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,138
know?

1196
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:54,555
>> We said we would.

1197
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,765
I don't see...

1198
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:56,474
>> Yeah.

1199
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,433
>> It's working so far.

1200
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,685
>> I know Lydia and Judd won't

1201
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,936
change; I know Rafe pretty much

1202
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:00,269
won't change.

1203
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,688
You know, I just...

1204
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,605
Sometimes I wonder what

1205
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,856
Stephenie's thinking, you know?

1206
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,149
Do you ever get like that or no?

1207
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,651
>> Yeah, you got to wonder what

1208
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,568
everybody's thinking.

1209
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,861
But you know, we said we'd do

1210
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:09,487
the six and it's working out for

1211
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,030
us, so why screw it up now?

1212
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:11,280
>> Good...

1213
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,865
>> No reason.

1214
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,408
>> I appreciate that a lot.

1215
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,200
'Cause I'm-I'm kind of scared

1216
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,411
now, just in case, you know...

1217
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,787
>> For me personally, Jamie's

1218
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,038
paranoia is just getting crazy.

1219
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,540
He just doesn't know when to be

1220
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,542
quiet.

1221
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,293
It just seems ridiculous, and

1222
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,921
it's getting old.

1223
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,301
>> Sure.

1224
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,191
>> Jamie is such a control

1225
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:47,400
freak.

1226
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,694
He'll come over and say, "Rafe,

1227
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,070
let's go play Guatemancala,"

1228
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,655
which has become his signal for

1229
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,239
"Rafe, I need to talk to you

1230
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,782
about the game."

1231
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,117
So I have to play Mancala with

1232
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,453
him every day.

1233
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,500
>> I mean, like, I don't know

1234
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,002
what to tell you.

1235
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:06,544
You're constantly asking.

1236
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,171
He's, like, "So you're sticking

1237
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:08,629
with the six, right?

1238
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,423
Are you going to stick with the

1239
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,132
six?

1240
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,300
You should stick with the six,

1241
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:12,467
right?

1242
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,259
I'm just worried that everyone's

1243
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,344
not going to stick with the

1244
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:15,553
six."

1245
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,179
I'm like "Jamie, I'm sticking

1246
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,889
with the six.

1247
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,056
Like, if you ask me again I'm

1248
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,724
going to die.

1249
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,850
I'm going to throw these pieces

1250
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,476
of corn at you.

1251
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,226
I-I... You're driving me

1252
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,103
insane."

1253
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,445
>> Okay.

1254
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,239
>> Okay.

1255
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,532
>> I don't know what to say, you

1256
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,908
know, I mean...

1257
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,535
It's a hard decision.

1258
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,703
Jamie and I, we have been

1259
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,497
together since day one.

1260
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,289
So it's very, very difficult for

1261
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,583
me to think about voting him

1262
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,794
off.

1263
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,969
>> Mm-hmm.

1264
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,520
>> Gary is a smooth operator.

1265
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,399
>> I-I think we should do it.

1266
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,234
>> Okay, that's what my heart

1267
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:53,484
says, too.

1268
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,280
>> What do you think, Lydia?

1269
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,781
>> You guys want Jamie to go,

1270
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,950
right?

1271
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:30,563
>> PROBST: We will now bring in

1272
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,773
the first member of our jury:

1273
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,233
Bobby Jon, voted out at the last

1274
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,153
Tribal Council.

1275
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,990
Jury members are here to listen

1276
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:41,908
in.

1277
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,408
You're not to direct any

1278
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,409
comments to them.

1279
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,203
They're gathering information to

1280
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:46,662
make a very big vote.

1281
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,206
So, let's talk about the reward

1282
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:49,415
first.

1283
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,084
Steph, the biggest reward we've

1284
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,502
had so far.

1285
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,213
And did it give you time to bond

1286
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,299
with Gary and with Danni and

1287
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,300
with Judd?

1288
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,426
>> Yeah, it absolutely did.

1289
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,677
I mean, we just enjoyed each

1290
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,137
other's company and just really

1291
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,055
got to know each other.

1292
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,097
And especially for Gary.

1293
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:05,723
I mean, he almost went home the

1294
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,892
day before.

1295
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:08,517
So, you know, we really kind of

1296
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,310
bonded.

1297
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,228
So that was cool.

1298
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,438
>> PROBST: Danni, do you feel

1299
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,522
the same way?

1300
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:13,814
>> Oh, yeah.

1301
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,608
I mean, I haven't had a chance

1302
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,525
to be on a team with

1303
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,860
Stephenie, and Gary and Judd

1304
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,236
hadn't had a chance, so it was

1305
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,363
just nice to get to know one

1306
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:20,613
another.

1307
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,447
Um, 'cause we're pretty familiar

1308
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,365
with everybody else.

1309
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,407
>> PROBST: Judd, did you and

1310
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,159
Gary bond?

1311
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,410
>> Oh, man. Gary, to me, is just

1312
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,370
an amazing person, man.

1313
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,621
He's somebody that you want to

1314
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,455
look up to, man.

1315
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,748
I kind of keep my cool when he's

1316
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,457
around.

1317
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,792
You know, I try to be a man

1318
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,210
myself, but sometimes I feel

1319
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,544
like I'm a little kid at times.

1320
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,629
But Gary, man, he's... he's a

1321
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,338
man's man.

1322
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,798
I got to give it to him, man.

1323
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,216
Nothing but respect for him.

1324
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,425
>> PROBST: Would that make it

1325
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,510
more difficult to vote for him

1326
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,886
tonight, or are you able to go

1327
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,054
right back into game mode?

1328
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,222
>> Oh, no. This, to me, is

1329
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,348
probably going to be one of my

1330
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:47,807
most difficult votes.

1331
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,642
I mean, in order for me to move

1332
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,143
on, you know, it has to be done.

1333
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:51,644
I mean... it's not easy.

1334
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,188
It's not going to be easy, but I

1335
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:54,981
got to move on.

1336
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,107
>> PROBST: Jamie, is there

1337
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,650
anybody left that you would say,

1338
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,442
"You know what, I wouldn't miss

1339
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,320
them and I won't miss them when

1340
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,279
they're gone"?

1341
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,447
>> No, I-I couldn't say that

1342
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,657
about anybody else on this

1343
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,783
tribe.

1344
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,660
I think everybody here has super

1345
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,494
hearts and are super people.

1346
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,038
It's just when you're out in

1347
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,790
this jungle, you know, you can

1348
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,500
go insane out here, I believe,

1349
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,334
if you don't watch yourself.

1350
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,211
It gets to you.

1351
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,879
But all of these people here

1352
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,756
have been really supportive and

1353
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,549
really great.

1354
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,383
And so, may the best man or

1355
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,011
woman win.

1356
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:25,928
>> PROBST: Gary, mentally, where

1357
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:26,554
are you at in this game right

1358
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,264
now?

1359
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,640
>> You know, I think the most

1360
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,267
important thing out here is a

1361
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:31,767
positive attitude in any

1362
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,518
survival situation.

1363
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,603
And we are in a survival

1364
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,688
situation.

1365
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,023
You know, I'm weak.

1366
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,565
You can't do the things you

1367
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,191
normally do.

1368
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,277
So I'm just trying to be upbeat

1369
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,279
and just make it through every

1370
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,030
day.

1371
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,740
And what happens happens.

1372
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,199
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to

1373
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:47,908
the vote.

1374
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,993
Rafe, you have individual

1375
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:49,869
immunity.

1376
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,203
If you want it, you can give it

1377
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:51,787
to somebody you thought needed

1378
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,372
it or keep it for yourself.

1379
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,623
>> I'm going to keep it for

1380
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,708
myself.

1381
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,001
>> Rafe is the only one you

1382
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,918
cannot vote for.

1383
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,462
Everybody else is fair game.

1384
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,588
It is time to vote.

1385
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,506
Jamie, you're up.

1386
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,891
>> I hope we can be friends one

1387
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,516
day, but it's either you or me

1388
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,978
tonight, buddy.

1389
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,528
>> Jamie, I still think you got

1390
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,404
a big heart, and I'd want you on

1391
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:29,492
my team any day of the year.

1392
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,581
>> Gary, thanks for sharing this

1393
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,875
experience with me, buddy.

1394
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,085
We got to let you go.

1395
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,086
I don't want to, but...

1396
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,212
Thanks for everything and God

1397
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,589
bless you.

1398
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,853
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1399
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,522
votes.

1400
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,322
Once the votes are read, the

1401
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:09,240
decision is final.

1402
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,533
The person voted out will be

1403
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,867
asked to leave the Tribal

1404
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,244
Council area immediately.

1405
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,246
I'll read the votes.

1406
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,706
First vote...

1407
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,710
Gary.

1408
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,962
Gary.

1409
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:27,424
Two votes Gary.

1410
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,175
Jamie.

1411
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,929
Two votes Gary, one vote Jamie.

1412
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,680
Jamie.

1413
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,682
Two votes Gary, two votes Jamie.

1414
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,602
Jamie.

1415
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,062
That's three votes Jamie,

1416
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,273
two votes Gary.

1417
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,152
Jamie.

1418
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,988
Four votes Jamie.

1419
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:53,659
The 11th person voted out of

1420
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:57,663
<i>Survivor Guatemala,</i> Jamie.

1421
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,755
Jamie, the tribe has spoken.

1422
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,258
>> Blindsided-- nice.

1423
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,093
Now that's how you vote somebody

1424
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,387
out.

1425
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,597
(mutters)

1426
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,523
>> PROBST: Well, Jamie just gave

1427
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,066
you the best advice anybody

1428
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,484
could: blindsided.

1429
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,652
Who you share information with

1430
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,530
and what information you share

1431
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,908
is critical if you want any shot

1432
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,575
in this game.

1433
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,784
Consider that a gift.

1434
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,827
Grab your torches.

1435
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,870
Head back to camp.

1436
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,498
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i> Judd is left reeling

1447
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,724
after Tribal Council.

1448
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,643
>> I don't know what to say.

1449
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,061
I mean, I wish somebody would

1450
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,187
have told me.

1451
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,188
It makes me wonder, from now on

1452
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,147
what the hell is going on?

1453
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,190
>> PROBST: And emotions run

1454
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,024
high.

1455
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,025
>> And I don't want to hear any

1456
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:08,609
more about it...

1457
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,693
>> Well, you say nothing's

1458
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:09,944
personal.

1459
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,695
Everything's personal, man.

1460
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,613
>> You think this isn't going to

1461
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,155
show me where your loyalties

1462
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,406
lie?

1463
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,866
You are sadly mistaken.

1464
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:22,790
>> It really hurts that Lydia

1465
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,792
voted against me because I took

1466
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,709
her so far.

1467
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,253
As much as I warned Lydia about

1468
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:27,836
times she was in trouble, she

1469
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,672
couldn't tell me I was in

1470
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,298
trouble, so that's gonna be hard

1471
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,633
for me to forgive her for that.

1472
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,884
It hurts when you see good

1473
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,344
people go bad, but that's how

1474
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:35,970
the game plays.

1475
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,304
You know, honesty is a huge

1476
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,389
thing, and I don't think I ever
