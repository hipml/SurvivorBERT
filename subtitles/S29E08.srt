MERGED, THERE WERE TWO BATTLING

7
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:10,427

15
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,734

>> FOR THE THIRD TRIBAL IN A ROW

18
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,613
WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE MIDDLE.

19
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,740
THIS IS A BIG DECISION.

20
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,782
>> KNOW.

21
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,075

00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,326
CONVINCED THEM TO JOIN HIS

26
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,836
BE VOTING JEREMY OUT TONIGHT.

27
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,504

00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,298
JEREMY, JULIE MADE A SHOCKING

29
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:48,548
DECISION.

30
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,592
YOU'RE QUITTING THE GAME.

31
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:50,800

JEREMY AND LEAVING THE GAME UP

35
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,265
IN THE AIR.

36
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,017
SOMEBODY MAYBE JUST GOT A

37
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,684
MILLION-DOLLAR BREAK.

38
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,310
>> JEREMY IS ON BORROWED TIME

39
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,439
NOW, AND I DON'T THINK HE EVEN

40
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:04,689
REALIZED.

41
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,523

00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,923
"ARE YOU SERIOUS?"

47
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,382
YOU DON'T QUIT!

48
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,926
BECAUSE JULIE QUIT, WE DIDN'T

49
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,636
HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL, AND IT

50
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,970
REALLY THREW A WRINKLE IN THE

51
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:36,179
PLAN.

52
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,806
I MEAN, I THINK FOR EVERYBODY.

53
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,391
MY ALLIANCE HAS THEIR PLAN TO

55
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,268
WE'RE READY TO GO.

56
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,312
BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL WE

57
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,272
GET TO A TRIBAL.

58
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,273
>> THIS IS THE PART OF THE GAME

59
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,192
WHERE IT'S LIKE, I KNOW I'M

60
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,444
PLAYING THE GAME, BUT I DON'T

61
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,198
KNOW IF WE'RE JUST BEING

62
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,032
DECEITFUL.

63
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:56,825
YOU KNOW?

64
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,285
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING AROUND

65
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,161
TROUNCING JEREMY, WE GOT HIM,

66
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,373
TROUNCING MISSY AND BAYLOR, WE

67
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,875
GOT HIM, AND THEN BLINDSIDING

68
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,084
PEOPLE.

69
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:06,376
>> OH, WELL.

70
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,752
>> WE DIDN'T HAVE A TRIBAL LAST

71
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:07,961
NIGHT.

72
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,212
SO NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE

73
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,339
JACLYN AND I STAND RIGHT NOW.

74
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,258
THEY THINK I'M SOLLOID THAT

75
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,759
SIDE, I'M SOLLOID THAT SIDE.

76
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,302
BUT THE FACT IS WE DECIDED ON

77
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,262
TAKING OUT JEREMY.

78
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,181
THIS MOVE IS A BIG MOVE.

79
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,224
>> YEAH, IT IS.

80
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,143
>> I MEAN, JEREMY IS THE LEADER

81
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,061
OF THE PACK.

82
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,479
AND TO TAKE HIM OUT THIS EARLY--

83
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,439
>> WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

84
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,108
JOSH IS THE LEADER OF THE OTHER

85
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:30,316
PACK.

86
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,192
>> THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S SO

87
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,318
GOOD RIGHT NOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

88
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,487
ASKING HOW DO WE WORK WHO JON

89
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,116

00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,909
"HEY, GET JON AND JACLYN OUT."

91
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,245
>> YEAH, SO WE'RE FINE.

92
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,329
>> JEREMY IS GOING TO BE GOING

93
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,124
HOME VERY, VERY SOON.

94
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:46,749
ORIGINALLY WE TOLD HIM WE WERE

95
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,459
DOWN WITH VOTING OUT JOSH SO I

96
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,378
DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY CLUE

97
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:50,920
WHATSOEVER THAT JACLYN AND I

98
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,422
HAVE FLIPPED, BUT ULTIMATELY, I

99
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,049
DO NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT MY BEST

100
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,676
PATH IS, AND MY BEST PATH RIGHT

101
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:01,222
NOW DOES NOT INCLUDE JEREMY.

102
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:36,007

CART.

115
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,026
YOU'LL THEN PUSH THAT CART TO

116
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,277
THE BASE OF A TOWER, WHERE YOU

117
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,488
WILL USE THOSE PIECES TO BUILD A

118
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,198
TEMPLE.

119
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,324
ONCE THE TEMPLE IS BUILT, ONE

120

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,742
AND I'M LOOK AT HIM LIKE, COME

379
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,161
ON, I KNOW YOU GUYS WERE

380
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:44,495
TARGETING ME.

381
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,704
GET OUT OF HERE.

382
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,997
IT TELLS ME KEITH IS AT LEAST

383
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,707
TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME, BUT I

384
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,291
DON'T THINK HE'S VERY GOOD AT

385
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,750
IT.

386
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,045
>> I WANT THREE OR FOUR HARD

387
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,338
TALK ORGANIZATION DOUBLE CHEESE,

388
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:54,630
DOUBLE MEAT.

389
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,881
>> TAKE IT EASY.

390
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,257
SLOW AND STEADY.

391
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,009
>> WINS THE RACE, YEAH.

392
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,971
MY DAD SAID SLOW DOWN, ENJOY IT,

393
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,640
AND, OF COURSE, I DIDN'T AT ALL,

394
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:10,688
AND I'M SCARFING DOWN BURRITOS,

395
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,314
QUESEDAS, MARGARITAS, AND BEER.

396
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,275
I JUST WISH I HAD THE WILL POWER

397
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,987
TO CONTROL MYSELF.

398
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,863
>> YOUR DOUBLE MEAT.

399
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,822
>> OH, YEAH!

400
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,865
>> TWO MORE AND HE'S GOING TO BE

401
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,073
SICK.

402
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,617
TWO MORE OF THOSE BABIES.

403
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,245
>> LIKE I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT

404
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:26,454
THAT.

405
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,747
IT WAS ALL FUN AND GIMUNTIL I

406
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,665
FELT LIKE CRAP.

407
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,542
( BURPS )

408
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:31,834
ALL RIGHT.

409
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,043
>> AS LONG AS YOU KEEP BURPING,

410
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,545
I GUESS YOU'RE OKAY.

411
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,213
WESLEY IS A GOOD KID.

412
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:36,922
HE AIN'T BEEN IN JAIL YET, YOU

413
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,383
KNOW, BUT HE DOES MAKE SOME

414
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:39,675
MISTAKES.

415
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,886
I CAN JUST GIVE HIM MY WORDS OF

416
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,053
WISDOM IS ABOUT ALL I CAN DO.

417
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:43,888
>> UH-OH.

418
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,722
>> UH-OH.

419
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,348
>> WANDERING OFF.

420
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,686
>> THAT'S MY BOY OVERLODING OVER

421
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:50,853
THERE.

422
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,855
>> IT WILL PASS, MAN, JUST

423
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,063
BREATHE.

424
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:53,814
( BURPS )

425
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,899
>> OH!

426
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,818
>> WHO THE HECK RAISED HIM?

427
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,320
I DON'T-- HIS MAMMA?

428
00:12:59,403 --> 00:12:59,862
I DON'T KNOW.

429
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,198
GOSH DARN.

430
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:08,037
>> OH!

431
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,748
>> THE SNAILS ARE PRETTY.

432
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,708
>> IT WILL BE PLENTY FOR ALL OF

433
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:12,875
US.

434
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,918
WELL, THE REWARD CHALLENGE,

435
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,003
NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE LOST.

436
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,839
AND, MAN, IT WAS FRUSTRATING.

437
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,382
BUT, HONESTLY, THIS COULDN'T

438
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,884
HAVE GONE BETTER AS FAR AS THE

439
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,344
PEOPLE I NEEDED TO BE TALKING TO

440
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,721
AND THE PEOPLE I NEEDED TO BE

441
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,431
BONDING WITH, SO I'M GOING TO

442
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,849
PUT MY LITTLE FEELERS OUT THERE

443
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,892
ONE MORE TIME WITH BAYLOR TO TRY

444
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:36,649
TO GET THE TARGET OFF MY BACK.

445
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,525
CAN I BE HONEST?

446
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,275
>> YEAH, OF COURSE,.

447
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,486
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU OWE ME AT

448
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,947
LEAST ONE VOTE TO NOT VOTE FOR

449
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,113
ME.

450
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,492
I LITERALLY PUSHED FOR YOU EVERY

451
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,328
SINGLE TIME TO TAKE YOU OFF THE

452
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,913
CHOPPING BLOCK, AND LITERALLY

453
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,288
SAVED YOU ONCE.

454
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,374
IF YOUR ALLIANCE IS ALL GONNA

455
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,792
VOTE REED OR MYSELF, IF YOU

456
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,335
WOULD NOT VOTE THAT.

457
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,087
JUST OUT OF RESPECT BECAUSE I

458
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,879
FEEL LIKE I STUCK MY NECK OUT

459
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,047
FOR YOU A COUPLE OF TIMES.

460
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,132
>> IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN

461
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,593
JOSH CAME UP TO ME AND SAID,

462
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,761
"YOU OWE ME."

463
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,555
I ALMOST FEEL LIKE I'M BEING,

464
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,180
LIKE, BLACKMAILED A LITTLE BIT.

465
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,224
TO ME, THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM

466
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,934
LIKE A GUY WHO COMES FROM A

467
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,311
CHRISTIAN FAMILY AND A PASTOR

468
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:14,603
FOR A DAD.

469
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,272
I MEAN, I WAS TAUGHT THAT YOU

470
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,399
SHOULD GIVE A GIFT WITHOUT

471
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,024
EXPECTING ANYTHING IN RETURN,

472
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,361
SOYY FEEL LIKE I DON'T OWE HIM

473
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:22,611
ANYTHING.

474
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,113
THE THING THAT'S BEEN TOSSED

475
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,532
AROUND IN MY PLAYING FIELD IN MY

476
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,450
EARS, PEOPLE SAY JOSH USED YOU

477
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,120
AND DRUG YOU LONG SO HE COULD

478
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,246
CONTINUE USING YOU FOR A VOTE.

479
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,496
>> I KNOW.

480
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,248
AND I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT

481
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,541
YOUR MOM HAS BEEN SAYING.

482
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,001
I WAS TRYING TO SOLIDIFY HER AND

483
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,836
MISSY'S VOTES FOR THE COUPLES

484
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,796
JUST TO GIVE US A COUPLE OF MORE

485
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,215
NUMBERS, BUT MISSY IS KIND OF

486
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,592
CONTROLLING BAYLOR RIGHT NOW.

487
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,217
AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING

488
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,177
TO VOTE WITH THE COUPLES SO AT

489
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,804
THIS POINT, I'M PRETTY FED UP

490
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,055
WITH BAYLOR.

491
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,724
I JUST A MINUTE AGO WAS TALKING

492
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,308
TO HER AND I WAS LIKE, "HERE'S

493
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
THE DEAL, BAYLOR.

494
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,519
I DID SAVE YOU."

495
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,812
AND I WAS LIKE, "IT WOULD BE

496
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,105
GREAT IF YOU JUST GAVE ME ONE

497
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,691
VOTE AT ONE POINT."

498
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,776
NOT THAT IT'S GOING TO HELP

499
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,029
ANYTHING.

500
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,655
>> RIGHT.

501
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,031
>> FACT.

502
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:11,243
>> RIGHT.

503
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,911
>> I DON'T MIND SEEING MY NAME.

504
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,204
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO OUT, YOU

505
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:14,622
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

506
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,247
>> RIGHT.

507
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,000
>> I REALLY AM HOPING JON AND

508
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,377
JACLYN ARE BEING TRUTHFUL BUT

509
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,087
ALL I CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS HOPE

510
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,048
THEY ARE AND TRY AND KEEP THAT

511
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:29,928
RELATIONSHIP GOING.

512
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,191
>> EXILE ISLAND IS EXTREMELY

513
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:42,858
DESOLATE.

514
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:46,070
AND BEING OUT HERE BY MYSELF

515
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,278
SUCKS.

516
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:46,570
I'M LONELY.

517
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,030
I MISS JACLYN.

518
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:52,826
I DO FEEL LIKE WITH JACLYN IN MY

519
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,369
GAME, SHE'S, OBVIOUSLY, BEEN

520
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,204
HELPING ME MAKE ALL THE

521
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:55,496
DECISIONS.

522
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,122
WITH ME AWAY, IT GIVES JACLYN

523
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,707
HER CHANCE TO BUILD THOSE

524
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,833
RELATIONSHIPS UP SO THAT SHE'S

525
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,169
NOT JUST SEEN AS, LIKE THE

526
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:09,009
TAGALONG.

527
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,969
"HERE AT EXILE, LACK OF WATER IS

528
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,806
A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

529
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,517
IT CAN QUENCH YOUR THIRST FOR

530
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,725
POWER.

531
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,351
FOR MOTHER NATURE'S COOPERATION

532
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,770
YOU MUST CHOOSE THE PROPER

533
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:19,978
HOUR."

534
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,939
I OPEN UP THE CLUE, AND MY REERS

535
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,940
IMMEDIATELY PERKED.

536
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,108
IT'S A CLUE TO A NEW IDOL THAT'S

537
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,193
HERE ON EXILE INSTEAD OF BACK AT

538
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,028
OUR CAMP.

539
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,197
AND THIS IS HUGE.

540
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,491
IT SAID, "LACK OF WATER SAY

541
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:32,908
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD."

542
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,159
SO I'M THINKING I HAVE TO GO

543
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,662
SEARCHING WHILE THE TIDE IS LOW

544
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,287
AND THE SWORD KIND OF LOOKS LIKE

545
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,707
A PENINSULA, AND I LOOK AND

546
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,999
THERE'S THIS BIG PENINSULA

547
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,875
STICKING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF

548
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,085
EXILE ISLAND.

549
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,671
SO I'M THINKING IT'S GOT TO BE

550
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:53,929
OVER THERE.

551
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,639
AS I MAKE MY WAY AROUND, THERE'S

552
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,891
A BILLION ROCKS HERE.

553
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,436
I'M LOOKING UNDER ALL OF THEM.

554
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:08,569
BUT I CAN'T FIEND AN IDOL.

555
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,862
THE TIDE WAS COMING UP.

556
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,488
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO GET

557
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,282
ANOTHER CHANCE TO LOOK FOR IT.

558
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,200
I WAS LIKE, I NEED TO FIND IT

559
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:22,833
RIGHT NOW.

560
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,209
THE NEXT LOGICAL PLACE THAT IT

561
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,295
WOULD BE IS UP ON THIS BIG

562
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,254
PILLAR RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THAT

563
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:33,093
I HAVEN'T CLIMBED YET.

564
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:42,436
ROCK.

565
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,648
OH, YES!

566
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:46,899
WOO-EEE!

567
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,276
FOUND ME A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

568
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:49,693
OH, THANK YOU, GOD.

569
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,696
SHE IS A BEAUTY.

570
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,573
THAT'S A GAME CHANGER.

571
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,908
THEN IT'S EXCITING TO HAVE THAT

572
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,243
KIND OF POWER IN THE GAME

573
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,828
BECAUSE NOW WHATEVER I WANT TO

574
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,663
HAPPEN REALLY IS GOING TO

575
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:01,872
HAPPEN.

576
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,249
THERE'S MY IDOL!

577
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:33,362
I KEPT WAKING UP TO... OH, MAN.

578
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,780
>> I HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET.

579
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,366
I WISHED I HAD BURPED AND FARTS.

580
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,118
IF I DID, I WOULD MAKE SURE SHE

581
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:40,452
SMELLED THEM.

582
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,370
>> WES AND ALEC AND KEITH,

583
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,413
THEY'RE JUST RUDE,UN.

584
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,790
THEY'RE NOT EVEN TRYING TO HIDE

585
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,332
IT, AND THEY'RE LAUGHING.

586
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,333
IT.

587
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,209
>> YOU AND JON ARE THE ONLY

588
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:47,501
GENTLEMEN.

589
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,503
THE REST OF THEM, THEY'RE A

590
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:49,837
BUNCH OF PIGS

591
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,254
>> THEY'RE SO RUDE.

592
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,547
IT'S CRAZY.

593
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,799
I MEAN, AS A FIREFIGHTER, WE ACT

594
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,676
LIKE THAT AT THE FIREHOUSE

595
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,635
SOMETIMES,UN WHAT I MEAN?

596
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,761
BUT AS SOON AS A WOMAN COMES

597
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,596
WILL IN THE ROOM, YOU SHUT IT

598
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,055
DOWN.

599
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,557
EVERYONE'S ON THEIR BEST

600
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,933
BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THAT'S HOW

601
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:03,851
YOUABT AROUND WOMEN.

602
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,434
BUT THESE GUYS, THEATRE FIRST

603
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,687
ONES TO EAT, LIKE JUMPING IN

604
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,229
FRONT OF THE GIRLS.

605
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,230
I'M LIKE WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING?

606
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,148
HAVE SOME MANNERS.

607
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:10,524
>> HERE YOU GO.

608
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,316
>> WHAT IS THIS?

609
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,777
>> IT'S TRASH.

610
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,571
>> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH

611
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:15,737
IT.

612
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,947
>> THROW IT AWAY IN THE WATER.

613
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,407
>> DUDE.

614
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,492
ALREADY.

615
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,535
>> WHAT?

616
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,411
>> NOTHING.

617
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,745
I'M DOWN.

618
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,247
I FEEL LIKE A SLAVE, BUT I'M

619
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:25,414
DOWN.

620
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,415
>> YOU FEEL LIKE A SLAVE?

621
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,250
YOU WANT SOME FISH?

622
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,544
I MEAN, THIS AIN'T NO CHARITY

623
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:30,878
NOW?

624
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,964
>> ALEC TREATS ME LIKE I'M HIS

625
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,549
BABY SISTER WHO HE WANTS TO BUG,

626
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,758
AND THAT'S BEEN THE CASE SINCE

627
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:36,967
DAY ONE.

628
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,095
SO I'M KIND OF OVER IT.

629
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,055
>> HE'S LIKE THAT TO ALL THE

630
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:42,264
WOMEN.

631
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,223
HE'S RUDE TO ME, TOO.

632
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,349
JUST ROLL IT OFF YOUR BACK.

633
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,810
>> I'M TRYING BUT IT'S JUST

634
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,102
OBNOXIOUS.

635
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,937
MOI MOM IS LIKE, "JUST, LET IT

636
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,605
GO."

637
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,107
UNFORTUNATELY, I GET BUGGED

638
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,316
EASILY.

639
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,358
>> COME ON, BAYLOR.

640
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,486
WE'LL COME AND GET SOME WOOD PUP

641
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,280
AIN'T DONE NOTHING BUT LAY THERE

642
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:58,906
ALL DAY.

643
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,240
AT LEAST CHECK A PULSE EVERY NOW

644
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:00,699
AND THEN.

645
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,742
>> I HAVE TO GET WOOD.

646
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:05,621
>> ARE WE ON BREAK?

647
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,997
IT'S HARD TO GET GOOD HELP.

648
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,416
>> OKAY, REPORTING TO FOR DUTY.

649
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,211
>> IF YOU WERE MY KID YOU WOULD

650
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,545
HAVE GOT WOOPED 10 TIMES TODAY.

651
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,673
>> IT'S THE MOST CHAUVINISTIC

652
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,758
GROUP I HAVE MET.

653
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,593
I HAVE SEEN RUDE PEOPLE BEFORE

654
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,845
BUT THIS IS THE WORST.

655
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,680
>> GIRLS, KEEP THIS FIRE GOING.

656
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,306
NATALIE WILL DO IT.

657
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,308
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL.

658
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,935
>> DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID?

659
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,603
>> THAT WAS AN ANNOYING COMMENT.

660
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,312
>> LIKE, SHOULDN'T THEY TRY TO

661
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,480
BE NICE TO ME?

662
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,315
LIKE, THEY NEED MY VOTE, AND

663
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,860
WHATEVER I REALLY WANT, JON WILL

664
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,486
DO.

665
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,029
SO-- THE GUYS ON THIS TRIBE ARE

666
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,656
REALLY ARROGANT AND RUDE.

667
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,490
I ALREADY KNEW THAT, BUT, LIKE,

668
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,534
AFTER JON LEFT, OH, MY GOSH, I

669
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,786
SAW SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY

670
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,745
THEY TREATED ME.

671
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,872
AND I'M JUST LIKE, SCREW YOU,

672
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,081
GUYS.

673
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,208
WITHOUT ME AND JON'S VOTE, YOU

674
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,042
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

675
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,838
THEY'RE SO DUMB.

676
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,423
>> AND ALSO THE FACT THAT-- ALL

677
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,341
YOU DO IS--

678
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,385
>> JON CAN VOTE WITH THEM, BUT

679
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,928
I'M NOT.

680
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:07,724
NO WAY.

681
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,602
>> AGAIN, WE CAN'T LET JEREMY

682
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:10,769
WIN.

683
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,604
>> NO, THAT'S TRUE.

684
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,564
WE STILL NEED TO TOUCH BASE WITH

685
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:14,731
JON.

686
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,817
>> ALTHOUGH, WE ALREADY GOT OUR

687
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,025
PLAN.

688
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:17,651
HE WANTS TO DO, AND IT'S TIME TO

689
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,362
DO IT WHO ELSE YOU GOTTA TOUCH

690
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:20,779
BASE WITH?

691
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,364
>> I WOULD THINK JACLYN.

692
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,658
>> YEAH, NO, SHE'S GOING TO BE

693
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:24,866
DOWN.

694
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,784
SHE'S GOING TO VOTE WITH JON.

695
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,828
>> SHE'S BEEN TALKING TO BAYLOR

696
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,870
THIS WHOLE TIME.

697
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,747
NO TELLING WHAT IN THE HECK--

698
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,958
>> I'M TELLING YOU, JON'S RIDING

699
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,458
WITH THE BOYS.

700
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,084
I'M TELL YOU.

701
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,502
I FEEL AS COMFORTABLEAISE

702
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,045
PROBABLY COULD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

703
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,588
JON IS A SMART DUDE.

704
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,007
HE KNOWS THAT JEREMY IS A

705
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,842
THREAT, AND HE TRUSTS ME, AND

706
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,301
THAT'S BIG DISPP I KNOW THAT

707
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,386
JACLYN'S GOING TO DO WHATEVER

708
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:44,678
JON SAYS.

709
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:48,140
SO THIS ALLIANCE IS STICKING

710
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,016
TOGETHER AND AS LONG AS JEREMY

711
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,058
DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY, WE'RE

712
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,855
GOING TO VOTE HIM OUT.

713
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:11,997
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

714
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,415
WE'LL NOW BRING IN JON RETURNING

715
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,002
FROM EXILE ISLAND.

716
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:17,294
( APPLAUSE )

717
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:24,342
>> HI.

718
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,511
>> HI, BABY.

719
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,681
>> I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

720
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,766
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS

721
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,351
READY TO GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY

722
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:33,602
CHALLENGE?

723
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,144
>> YES.

724
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:34,728
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

725
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,023
KEITH, I WILL TAKE BACK THE

726
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:38,273
NECKLACE.

727
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,566
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO HELP

728
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:39,733
ME.

729
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,737
>> I WANT TO KEEP IT.

730
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,114
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

731
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:46,907
FOR GRABS.

732
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,200
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT

733
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,286
KIND OF IMPACT 21 DAYS HAS HAD

734
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:51,620
ON AREA MIND.

735
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,914
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A SERIES

736
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,581
OF SYMBOLS.

737
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,458
YOU'RE GOING TO USE YOUR CUBE TO

738
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,584
REPEAT THEM BACK TO ME.

739
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,419
GET IT RIGHT, YOU STAY ALIVE.

740
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,004
GET IT WRONG, YOU'RE OUT.

741
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,881
THE LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING

742
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:03,673
WINS IMMUNITY.

743
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,760
SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

744
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,511
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE

745
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,428
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT.

746
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,889
BIG STAKES.

747
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:11,932
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

748
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:18,522

00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,343
FOR BAYLOR TONIGHT.

904
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,596
I TRIED TO GET BAYLOR ON MY

905
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,972
SIDE, BUT SHE DIDN'T GO FOR IT.

906
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,266
SO SHE'S GOT TO GO.

907
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,186
BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M RELYING ON

908
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,896

909
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,982

910
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:41,654
DAY OUT HERE.

911
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,074
>> HOW WAS EVERYTHING WHILE I

912
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,159
WAS GONE?

913
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,035
>> WELL, I DON'T LIKE THE GUYS

914
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,661
ANYMORE AT ALL.

915
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,287
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH

916
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:49,496
THEM.

917
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,247
>> WHY?

918
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:51,873
>> WELL, FOR ONE, THEY DON'T

919
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,584
TALK TO ME WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE.

920
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,126
THEY DON'T EVEN REGARD ME.

921
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,545
AND JUST THINKING ABOUT IT IN

922
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,464
ALL THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGES, OUR

923
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,465
BIGGEST THREATS ARE THOSE GUYS.

924
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,090
I CAN'T WIN AGAINST THEM PUP ARE

925
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,051
GOING TO HAVE A TOUGH TIME.

926
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,470
WHY DON'T WE JUST VOTE THEM OUT

927
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:05,678
FIRST?

928
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,013
>> COMING BACK FROM EXILE, I HAD

929
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,681
INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT JACLYN

930
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,600
AND I WERE GOING TO BE ALIGNING

931
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,268
WITH JOSH AND THE GUYS.

932
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,312
BUT THEN JACLYN BROUGHT UP SOME

933
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,064
INTERESTING INFORMATION THAT

934
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,942
WHILE I WAS GONE, THE GUYS WERE

935
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,443
COMPLETELY IGNORING HER THE

936
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,027
WHOLE TIME AND MADE HER FEEL

937
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,278
LIKE CRAP.

938
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,697
I MEAN, THIS IS THE LOVE OF MY

939
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,031
LIFE TALKING.

940
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,534
HOWEVER, THIS IS A GAME.

941
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,370
AND IT CAN'T BE JUST ACTING ON

942
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:30,620
EMOTIONS.

943
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,580
>> WE HAVE A BETTER TIME BEATING

944
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,206
MISSY, NATALIE, BAYLOR, AND--

945
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,209
>> BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT

946
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,126
JEREMY IN THE FINAL THREE.

947
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:37,544
HE'S GOING TO WIN.

948
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:43,508
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

949
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,759
>> HOW'S IT GOING.

950
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:45,009
>> HI.

951
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:45,510
>> HI.

952
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,720
>> WHAT'S UP?

953
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,930
>> NOCT.

954
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,931
>> WHO'S GOING HOME TONIGHT?

955
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,517
>> THE PLAN RIGHT NOW IS TO VOTE

956
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:52,767
BAYLOR.

957
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,102
EVERYONE WANTS BAYLOR OUT.

958
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,144
BECAUSE SHE'S ANNOYING.

959
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:55,937
>> AND SHE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.

960
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,064
>> I MISSED YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

961
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,857
>> I KNOW.

962
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,817
TWO DAYS.

963
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,235
THAT WAS SO BRUTAL.

964
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,863
ALL RIGHT, KIDS, I'M GOING TO

965
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,030
GO.

966
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:06,614
>> JON AND I HAVE TO DECIDE

967
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,615
WHICH WAY TO GO.

968
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,283
I THOUGHT THAT JON WAS GOING TO

969
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,201
HAVE MY BACK, BUT HE'S WORRIED

970
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,745
ABOUT TEAMING UP WITH JEREMY

971
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,080
BECAUSE HIS STORY WOULD WIN OVER

972
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,708
OUR STORY IN THE FINAL THREE.

973
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,710
SO JON'S THINKING REALLY FAR

974
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,836
AHEAD, WHICH IS STUPID.

975
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,254
BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE THERE'S ALL

976
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,299
THIS UP IN THE AIR WITH

977
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:29,012
EVERYTHING.

978
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,473
>> WHOSE TURN IS IT TO GO WHAT

979
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,349
ARE YOU ALL THINKING?

980
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,269
>> KEITH, ARE YOU BASICALLY

981
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,562
LIKE-- IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE?

982
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,271
>> NOT REALLY.

983
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,022
>> CAN'T YOU SWAY THEM, KEITH?

984
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,065
>> WELL--

985
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,985
>> HERE IT IS-- AND I HATE TO BE

986
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,321
BLUNT, BUT BAYLOR DON'T DO

987
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:46,613
( BLEEP ).

988
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,488
YOU KNOW THAT.

989
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,115
BAYLOR SLEEPS AND SHE GOES OVER

990
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:49,741
AND EATS.

991
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,200
I'VE BEEN HERE SIX DAYS AND I'VE

992
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,577
SEEN HER WITH ONE SCIENTIFIC

993
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,704
WOOD IN HER HANDS.

994
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,163
I'M JUST TELLING YOU.

995
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,665
AND WHAT GET ME, I SAY, "COME

996
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,085
ON, BAYLOR, "AND IF BAYLOR

997
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,629
SAYS,"I'M TIRED.

998
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,671
I WANT TO TAKE A NAP.

999
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,131
YOU JUMP IN AND YOU DO IT.

1000
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,424
>> YOU PROTECT YOUR SON, TOO.

1001
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,134
>> NOT LIKE, THAT THOUGH.

1002
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,720
WESLEY-- LORLD, NO, I DON'T DO

1003
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,638
THAT TO WESLEY.

1004
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:15,475
I'M JUST-- I'M-- JUST THE FACTS,

1005
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:15,683
MISSY.

1006
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,851
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS

1007
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,186
GUNNING FOR BAYLOR THING FOR A

1008
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,938
WHILE NOW AND I GOT MY EAR BENT

1009
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,649
ALREADY TODAY BY KEITH, "BAYLOR

1010
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,566
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING."

1011
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,109
IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD EVER TO

1012
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:29,864
HAVE YOUR CHILD PICKED ON.

1013
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:30,490
I'M GOING TO BACK HER AND THAT'S

1014
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,908
ALL THAT MATTERS.

1015
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,367
>> WHAT DID KEITH SAY?

1016
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,787
>> YOU.

1017
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,163
>> HE TOLD YOU THAT?

1018
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,499
TO MY FACE.

1019
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:43,211
HE'S NOT REAL SMART.

1020
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,755
>> I KNOW.

1021
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,214
I NEED TO TALK TO JON.

1022
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,717
>> YEAH, YOU DO.

1023
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,010
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT KEITH SPIT

1024
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,472
OUT MY NAME TO MY MOM, WHICH IS

1025
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:54,806
STUPID.

1026
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,307
YOU DON'T TELL THE MOM THAT

1027
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,934
YOU'RE VOTING FOR THE DAUGHTER,

1028
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:58,685
PERIOD.

1029
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,103
BUT NOW, I'M, OBVIOUSLY, ON THE

1030
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,354
CHOPPING BLOCK.

1031
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,064
I HAVE, LIKE, SICKENING

1032
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,233
BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH.

1033
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,318
SO I KIND OF JUST HAVE TO BE

1034
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,236
PREPARED AND HOPE THAT MY

1035
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:16,202
ALLIANCE PULLS THROUGH.

1036
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,161
>> COOL.

1037
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,371
YEAH.

1038
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,832
TONIGHT, JACLYN AND I HAVE TO

1039
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,250
MAKE A VERY BIG DECISION.

1040
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,585
AND THE SUCCESS WE'VE HAD SO FAR

1041
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,169
HAS BEEN AS A RESULT OF JACLYN

1042
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,047
AND I WORKING TOGETHER VERY

1043
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:28,256
WELL.

1044
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,842
BUT THIS TIME, JACLYN'S NOT ON

1045
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,969
THE SAME PAGE AS I AM.

1046
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,221
WE'RE GONNA VOTE JOSH.

1047
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,725
>> HEY, WE'RE IN CONTROL OF THIS

1048
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:38,933
GAME.

1049
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,643
IF WE GET BAYLOR OUT, LET'S DO

1050
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:40,893
IT.

1051
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:41,144
>> YEAH.

1052
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,272
>> I KNOW.

1053
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,399
>> I DON'T TRUST JON.

1054
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,650
HE'S SNEAKY.

1055
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,570
>> TOMORROW IT'S GONNA BE VERY

1056
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:50,778
CLEAR.

1057
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,280
>> EITHER VERY CLEAR OR VERY

1058
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,364
SHADY.

1059
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:53,614
>> YEAH.

1060
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,783
>> YEAH.

1061
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,617
>> I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH

1062
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:56,909
THOSE GUYS.

1063
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,786
BUT IT FEELS LIKE JON JUST

1064
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,245
DOESN'T CARE.

1065
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,788
I FEEL SO COMFORTABLE WITH MISSY

1066
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,122
AND JEREMY.

1067
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,791
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

1068
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,002
>> I THINK THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE.

1069
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:06,794
>> AFTER TONIGHT, THERE'S GOING

1070
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,546
TO BE A GOOD PORTION OF PEOPLE

1071
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,381
MAD AT US, NO MATTER WHICH WAY

1072
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:10,590
WE GO.

1073
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,508
IT'S HARD BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

1074
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,593
WEIGH SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS,

1075
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,303
AND WE'RE STILL GOING BACK AND

1076
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,637
FORTH.

1077
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,805
HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT,

1078
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,807
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

1079
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,767
SOMEBODY'S NOT GOING TO BE

1080
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,058
HAPPY.

1081
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:45,833
>> Jeff: JEREMY, LET'S TALK

1082
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,461
ABOUT TODAY'S IMMUNITY

1083
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:48,711
CHALLENGE.

1084
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,962
YOU ALWAYS WANTED IMMUNITY BUT

1085
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,130
WAS THERE ANY ADDED PRESSURE

1086
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,173
TODAY THAT YOU FELT I NEED IT?

1087
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,217
THIS IS THE GOING TO BE A CRAZY

1088
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,383
ONE.

1089
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,220
>> LET ME TELL YOU, JEFF, TODAY,

1090
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,763
IF I DIDN'T WIN THIS, PEOPLE

1091
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,265
WERE WRITING MY NAME DOWN AND I

1092
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,933
KNEW IT.

1093
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,351
>> Jeff: JOSH, SAME QUESTION.

1094
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,770
JEREMY CLEARLY THOUGHT I NEEDED

1095
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,437
IT TONIGHT.

1096
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,355
DID YOU FEEL THAT KIND OF

1097
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:07,605
PRESSURE?

1098
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:07,897
>> ABSOLUTE.

1099
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,315
I KNEW MY NAME WAS BEING TOSSED

1100
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,360
AROUND SO I KNEW I NEEDED IT FOR

1101
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:12,693
TONIGHT'S VOTE.

1102
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,153
>> Jeff: WES, ARE THE

1103
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:14,529
ALLIANCES KNOWN?

1104
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,905
>> I THINK THE ALLIANCES ARE

1105
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:16,114
KNOWN.

1106
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,492
I MEAN, ME, JOSH, REED, AND ALEC

1107
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,576
TEAMED UP WITH DAD, AND I FELT

1108
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,119
LIKE IT WAS KNOWN TO PEOPLE THAT

1109
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,664
WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER TYPE.

1110
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,499
>> Jeff: JEREMY, DOES THAT

1111
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,376
LEAVE YOU NATALIE, MISSY,

1112
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,335
BAYLOR, JACLYN AND JON TOGETHER?

1113
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,171
>> IT COULD.

1114
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,340
I'M NOT SURE.

1115
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,467
>> Jeff: JACLYN, YOU'RE A PART

1116
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,344
OF A LOVE PAIR.

1117
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,846
WHERE DOES DOES THAT LEAVE AND

1118
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,347
YOU JON IN TERMS OF ALLIANCES?

1119
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,265
>> WELL, JON AND ME HAVE BEEN

1120
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,475
APPROACHED BY BOTH SIDES SO THAT

1121
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,478
KIND OF PUTS US IN THE MIDDLE OF

1122
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,188
EVERYTHING, WHICH IS

1123
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:49,480
INTERESTING.

1124
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,148
>> Jeff: JON HOW IS THAT

1125
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:51,399
POSSIBLE?

1126
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,191
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY TRIBALS NOW

1127
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,568
THAT YOU AND JACLYN HAVE BEEN

1128
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:53,943
SORT OF THE SWING.

1129
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,862
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT'S THAT'S

1130
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:56,946
NOT WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

1131
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:57,363
PUT OURSELVES IN.

1132
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,782
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE

1133
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,034
SOMETHING PAINTED ON US THAT IS

1134
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,161
LIKE LIKE, "TALK TO US, AND WE

1135
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:04,829
MIGHT HELP YOU."

1136
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,706
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK IT IS

1137
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:06,914
BUT--

1138
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,040
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1139
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,667
>> Jeff: NATALIE, WHEN YOU SEE

1140
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,670
THAT JON'S GETTING APPROACHED

1141
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,379
BYE EVERYBODY, WHAT'S THE PLAY?

1142
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,422
BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S PROBABLY GOT

1143
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,298
A PRETTY GOOD PITCH.

1144
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,551
>> IT'S SO WEIRD, BUT I FEEL

1145
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:23,389
ALMOST PROTECTIVE OVER THE

1146
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,308
ORIGINAL HUNAHPU.

1147
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,643
AND JON IS SMIB FELT I COULD

1148
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,354
TRUST SO YOU NEED TO PICK A SIDE

1149
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,190
AND TRUST MOVINGED FOR.

1150
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,274
THE FUNNY THING IS, THOSE GUYS

1151
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,569
WERE CAMPAIGNING FOR JACLYN, BUT

1152
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,029
WHEN JON IS NOT THERE, THE

1153
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,280
BEHAVIOR SEEMS THEY DON'T EVEN

1154
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,156
NEED JACLYN--

1155
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,450
>> WHICH IS SO FRUSTRATING TO

1156
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:42,617
ME.

1157
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,201
EVERYONE GOES TO JON, AND THEN

1158
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,912
WHEN HE WENT TO EXILE, NOBODY

1159
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,913
REALLY CARED TO CAMPAIGN WITH

1160
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,414
ME, AND THE SECOND HE GOT BACK

1161
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,499
TODAY, IT WAS ALL ABOUT JON.

1162
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,334
AND, YOU KNOW, ME AND JON TALK.

1163
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,377
WE MAKE DECISION TOGETHER.

1164
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,422
SO PEOPLE SHHH MAYBE BE SMARTER

1165
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,715
ABOUT THAT.

1166
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,299
>> Jeff: DO YOU NOT FEEL

1167
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,051
RESPECTED OUT HERE?

1168
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,427
>> MAYBE BY A FEW PEOPLE, YEAH,

1169
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,803
I WOULD SAY THAT A LITTLE BIT.

1170
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,764
>> I CAN LAY THIS OUT FOR YOU.

1171
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:05,765
OKAY, SO I'M WATCHING A COUPLE

1172
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,934
OF THESE YOUNGER GUYS PRETEND

1173
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,101
LIKE THEY'RE IN A FRAT HOUSE.

1174
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,186
>> Jeff: YOU HAVE TO BE

1175
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:10,770
TALKING ABOUT WES AND ALEC.

1176
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,270
>> YOU GOT IT.

1177
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,941
AND THEY LITERALLY BELCH, FART,

1178
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,275
SPIT, THEY DON'T CARE IF THERE

1179
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,235
ARE FEMALES THERE OR NOT.

1180
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,613
>> BUT WE'RE NOT AT THE HILTON,

1181
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:20,821
MISSY.

1182
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,950
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD WESLEY FART,

1183
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,700
OR SPIT.

1184
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,035
BUT I'VE HAY LITTLE BIT OF GAS.

1185
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,286
I'M SURE EVERYBODY ON THIS PANEL

1186
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,245
HAS HAD GAS.

1187
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,831
IT'S JUST A NORMAL BODY

1188
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,082
FUNCTION.

1189
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:31,999
THIS IS "SURVIVOR" AND STUFF

1190
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,167
LIKE THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1191
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,627
YOU'RE GOING TO GET DIRTY.

1192
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,795
YOU'RE GOING TO GET NORTHWEST.

1193
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,922
YOU'RE GOING TO GET GAS.

1194
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,215
>> Jeff: REED IT'S A

1195
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:39,757
FASCINATING THING TO WATCH

1196
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,259
TONIGHT BECAUSE PERCEPTION IS

1197
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,594
REALITY TO THE PERCEIVER.

1198
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,054
IF SOMEBODY BELIEVES THEY'RE

1199
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:45,680
BEING DISRESPECTED, LIKE JACLYN,

1200
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,514
ARE YOU THAT WAY TO THEM.

1201
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,432
>> I THINK I'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT

1202
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,308
RESPECTFUL TO THE WOMEN OUT

1203
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:49,517
HERE.

1204
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,352
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE I

1205
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,812
MOMENT TO GO BACK TO WHEN

1206
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,188
NATALIE PITCHED HER CASE TO JON

1207
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,481
AND JACLYN, AND I THINK IT WOULD

1208
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,024
BE JUST AS VALUABLE FOR US TO

1209
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,234
GET A CHANCE.

1210
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:58,859
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, REED, MAKE

1211
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,069
YOUR CASE.

1212
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,529
>> I JUST THINK YOU GUYS ARE

1213
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,031
BOTH VERY POWERFUL, AND YOU'RE

1214
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,824
STRONG TOGETHER.

1215
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,409
YOU'RE BOTH THREATS IN

1216
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:06,701
CHALLENGES.

1217
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,162
SO IF YOU SIDE WITH A GROUP OF

1218
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:10,705
SINGLES, WHAT'S TO SAY THEY

1219
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,331
DON'T TURN RIGHT BACK AROUND OW

1220
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,874
AND VOTE YOU GUYS OUT.

1221
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,542
>> OKAY, WAIT, SO YOU'RE SAYING

1222
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,711
YOU GUYS AREN'T GOING TO TURN

1223
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,087
AROUND AND GET HIM OUT BECAUSE

1224
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:18,671
JONL IS THE BIGGEST THREAT?

1225
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,089
>> ABSOLUTE NOT.

1226
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,424
>> ALL RIGHT.

1227
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,009
>> Jeff: JON, YOU'RE BEING

1228
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,760
PITCHED FROM TWO GROUPS, A GROUP

1229
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,679
OF FIVE AND A GROUP OF FOUR.

1230
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,514
WOULD YOU RATHER YOU GUYS

1231
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,182
WEREN'T THE LINCHPIN?

1232
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,184
>> I THINK RIGHT NOW, I FEEL

1233
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,936
LIKE IT'S POSITIVE BECAUSE I

1234
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,980
FEEL LIKE JACLYN AND I ARE KIND

1235
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:36,605
OF CONTROLLING OUR OWN FATE, BUT

1236
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,400
THESE DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING,

1237
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,484
THEY'RE GAME CHANGERS, AND THAT

1238
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:45,698
CAN BE SCARY.

1239
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,115
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1240
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,825
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1241
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,952
REED, YOU'RE UP.

1242
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,469
>> SORRY YOU CAN'T HANDLE

1243
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:19,774
HANGING OUT WITH THE BIG BOYS.

1244
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,859
>> YOU'RE A STRONG PLAYER, BUT I

1245
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,569
STOPPED TRUSTING YOU WHEN YOU

1246
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,987
WROTE MY NAME DOWN THE FIRST

1247
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:41,921
TRIBAL AND DIDN'T TELL ME.

1248
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,429
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1249
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:58,521
VOTES.

1250
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,483
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1251
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,651
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1252
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:10,866
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1253
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,075
OKAY.

1254
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,243
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1255
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:12,868
DECISION IS FINAL.

1256
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,245
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1257
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,204
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1258
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,080

00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,917

A WHOLE NEW GAME?

1293
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,515
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

GOOD NIGHT.

1303
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:25,918

00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,779
HERE, AND THAT SENT ME PACKING.

1318
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,698

1320
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:57,908
EXPERIENCE.
