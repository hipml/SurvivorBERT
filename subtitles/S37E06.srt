00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:05,505
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:09,676
THE TRIBE WAS FACING TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AND THE DAVID WERE

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:13,213
OUTNUMBERED.

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,314
WERE IN BIG TROUBLE.

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,084
Jeff: BUT NATALIES
ABRASIVE PERSONALITY WAS GETTING

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,123
OLD.

7
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:27,127
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, ANGELINA
HAD A MASTER PLAN.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,364
THIS IS A PHONY VOTE SO I CAN
TRY TO GET NATALIES JACKET

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,465
BEFORE SHE LEAVES.

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:40,507
Jeff: SHE TRIED TO CON
NATALIE.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,243
NATALIE, IS THERE ANY WAY I
COULD HAVE YOUR JACKET?

12
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,279
Jeff: BUT ANGELINA WAS LEFT
EMPTY-HANDED.

13
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,847
NATALIE?

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,817
Jeff: WHEN NATALIE WAS SENT
HOME.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,152
NATALIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

16
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,586
THANK YOU, JEFF.

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,690
NATALIE?

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:06,933
Jeff: 14 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL
BE VOTED OAT TONIGHT?

19
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,969
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.

20
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,005
We go further, so you can.

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,040
YOURE HERE.

22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,108
YOU CAN DO THE HONORS.

23
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,845
YAY!

24
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:22,115
I THOUGHT I WAS NEVER GOING TO
SEE THAT DAY HERE.

25
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,218
I SURVIVED TRIBAL COUNCIL ONCE
AGAIN.

26
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,987
I HAVE MORE LIFE THAN A CAT,
MAN.

27
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,424
LYRSA, JUST TO BE SUPER
CLEAR, THE ONLY REASON I WROTE

28
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,560
YOUR NAME WAS TO TRY TO GET THAT
JACKET.

29
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,160
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

30
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,228
OH, MY GOT!

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:40,166
WHAT A PERFORMANCE.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,601
 ANGELINA WROTE MY NAME

33
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,304
BECAUSE SHE WANTED NATALIES
JACKET.

34
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,138
A JACKET?

35
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,906
LIKE, THATS VERY PETTY.

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,043
AND THATS REALLY MEAN AND THAT
SAYS A LOT ABOUT ANGELINAS

37
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,044
CHARACTER.

38
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:51,945
LYRSA?

39
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:52,712
WHAT.

40
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,013
CAN YOU DO ME THE BIGGEST
FAVOR?

41
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,281
SURE.

42
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,316
YOU WANT MY COAT?

43
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,686
NO.

44
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,922
FOR HER, THE JACKET IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN ME, SO, YEAH, I

45
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,690
DONT TRUST HER.

46
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,724
NATALIE IS GOING TO HATE US.

47
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,592
SHES GOING TO HATE ME.

48
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,593
SHES DEFINITELY GOING TO
HATE ME.

49
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,028
IM GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE MY
ADDRESS.

50
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:13,967
WE GAVE UP THE GOLIATH
MAJORITY, BUT NATALIE GOING HOME

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,235
WAS BITTERSWEET.

52
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,104
SHE WAS BITTER AND FOR THE TRIBE
IT WAS SWEET BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE

53
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,906
A LITTLE BIT MORE PEACE AROUND
CAMP.

54
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,776
WHEN SHE WALKED OUT YOU WERE
LIKE, NATALIE, CAN I HAVE JUR

55
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,345
JACKET?"
 I ASKED HER, LIKE, THREE

56
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,579
TIMES.

57
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,182
YOU JUMPED UP TO HUG HER, I
THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO REACH

58
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,518
AROUND AND GRAB THE JACKET OUT
OFIER BAG.

59
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,955
I WASNT GOING TO SHOPLIFT
FROM HER!

60
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,826
I WANTED NATALIE TO GET
BLINDSIDED BUT WALK AWAY HAVING

61
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,630
HER THINK I WAS ON HER SIDE TO
GET HER BEAUTIFUL FLEECE JACKET.

62
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,066
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU CANT ALWAYS
GET EVERYTHING THAT YOU WISH

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,101
FOR.

64
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,471
ANGELINA, I FEEL LIKE SHES--
 SHE IS SO FAKE.

65
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,274
JUST SO SHE COULD GET
NATALIES JACKET?

66
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:58,378
LAST NIGHT REALLY EXPOSED JUST
HOW COMPLETELY CRAZY SHE IS.

67
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,280
IT REALLY DID.

68
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,916
I THOUGHT IT WAS SO FUNNY WHEN
SHE DID THAT.

69
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,818
SHE WAS CRYING AND ACTING
SHOCKED.

70
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,186
SHE WAS LIKE...

71
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:06,920
REALLY?

72
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,289
THAT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

73
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,024
SHE DESERVES AN EMMY.

74
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,359
IT WAS A PERFECTLY TRIBAL IN
MY BOOK.

75
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,161
NATALIE GOES HOME, AND ANGELINA
LOOKS LIKE A FOOL IN FRONT OF

76
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,362
EVERYBODY.

77
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,097
IF ANGELINA WILL DO THAT FOR A
JACKET, IMAGINE WHAT SHELL DO

78
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,098
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.

79
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,534
AS FAR AS THE GAME GOES, SHE
WOULD CUT YOU--

80
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,037
SHES GOING TOO HARD.

81
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,973
ANGELINAS SEALING HER OWN FATE
WITH THIS KIND OF SHENANIGANS.

82
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,976
I KNOW SHES A SKETCH-BALL NOW,
I KNOW IT.

83
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,314
AND I THINK IT REALLY OPENED
MIKES PIPES SHE MIGHT FLIP ON A

84
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,148
DIME.

85
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,749
SHE WILL DEFINITELY FLIP ON A
TIME.

86
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,053
WE COULD GET OUT ANGELINA AND
IT WOULDNT BE NO SKIN OFF OUR

87
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,122
BACKS.

88
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:53,166

 GOING FISHING?

89
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,467

00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,003
IM GOING TO SEE WHERE THE FISH
ARE, AND THEN IM GOING TO SEE

91
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,105
IF I CAN, YOU KNOW, CATCH FISH
WITH A SPEAR.

92
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,240
THATS AWESOME!

93
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,175
GIVE IT A SHOT.

94
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:07,647
SO SPEAR FISHING ON "SURVIVOR"
IS THREE EQUIPMENT COMPONENTS,

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,384
ONE OF WHICH IS THE MASK TO MAKE
SURE YOU CAN BOTH SEE AND

96
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,018
BREATHE UNDER WATER.

97
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,287
YOUR NOSE IS SO SQUISHED.

100
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,092
NO, YOU PUT THOAM YOUR NORMAL
FEET.

101
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,128
WHEN ARE A BIT AWKWARD TO
WALK IN AS I FOUND OUT THE HARD

102
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:22,495
WAY.

103
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:22,895
HAVE FUN.

104
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,464
THANK YOU.

105
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,767
IVE NEVER PUT ON A PAIR OF
FLIPPERS BEFORE, I BELIEVE.

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,571
JUST EVERY STEP WAS A BLOW TO MY
GENERAL SELF-WORTH.

107
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,407
JUST THE PERSONAL EGO AGONY.

108

00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,580
AND, OF COURSE, THE BUSINESS END
HERE, THE SPEAR.

111
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,350
ESSENTIALLY, YOU TURN THIS INTO
A SPRING-LOADED MURDER MACHINE.

112
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,687
HOLD IT BACK, STORE A BUNCH OF
POTENTIAL ENERGY, AS WE CALL IT

113
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,425
IN THE PHYSICS BUSINESS, AND YOU
RELEASE IT IN THE FORM OF

114
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,728
KINETIC ENERGY-- I.E., STABBING.

115
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,864
I COULDNT CATCH ANY FISH.

116
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:02,135
CERTAINLY, I AM NOT A
FOOD-SEEKING MISSILE.

117
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,770
EVERYTHING LOOKS CLOSE, BUT IN
REALITY--

118
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,771
YEAH.

119
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,908
I GOTTA FIND A WAY TO SNEAK
UP ON THEM BETTER.

120
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,678
SO IF THEYRE COUNTING ON ME FOR
LARGE AMENDMENTS OF FOOD, WE MAY

Jeff: HERE COMES GABBY WITH

195
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,647
GABBY IS GOOD WITH THE SECOND.

196
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,216

00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,719

00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,489

NICK SCORES THE SECOND RING.

232
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,853
FOR JABENI.

233
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:55,795
IT IS TIVA WITH TWO, JABENI WITH
TWO, YOU H VUKU WITH ONE.

234
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,265
DAN SCORES THE THIRD RING FOR
TIVA.

235
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,668
TIVA DOWN TO THEIR LAST RING.

236
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,070
VUKU HAD THE RING.

237
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,573
DAN COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

238
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,040
YES!

239
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,408
TIVA WINS REWARD!

240
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,079
LOOKING FOR ONE MORE.

241
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,615
NICK SCORES THE THIRD RING FOR
JABENI.

242
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,950
DAVIE SCORES THE SECOND FOR
VUKU.

243
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,585
ITS NOW 3-2.

244
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,689
DAVIES GOT TO PICK IT UP NICK

245
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,491

JABENI WINS REWARD!

247
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:30,997
<i>( APPLAUSE ).</i>

248
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,501
AT LEAST ITS NOT TRIBAL.

249
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,070
Jeff: TIVA,
CONGRATULATIONS.

250
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,873
YOUR REWARD WILL BE WAITING FOR
YOU BACK AT CAMP.

251
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,109
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, ENJOY
THE AFTERNOON.

252
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,744
THANK YOU, JEFF.

253
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,214
Jeff: JABENI, GOT OFF TO A
MISERABLE START BUT YOU PULLED

254
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,248

255
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,417
COOKWARE, TWO KABOBS WAITING FOR
YOU BACK AT CAMP.

256
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,151
NICE JOB.

257

ENJOY IT.

258
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,920
VUKU, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

259
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,722
GRAB YOUR STUFF HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

260
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,625
WINNING IS THE GOOD THING,
BUT OTHERS ON THE OTHER TRIBE

261
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,729
WERE NOT HAPPY WE VOTED OFF
NATALIE.

262
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,998
MAYBE STAYING WITH ANGELINA
MAKES MORE SENSE.

263
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:10,136
IF WE MERGE TOGETHER, I HAVE
TAKEN OUT TWO GOLIATHS FROM MY

264
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,804
ORIGINAL TRIBE.

265
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,840
I WOULD HAVE A HUGE TARGET ON MY
BACK.

266
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:30,256
♪ ♪
 OH, MY GOD!

267
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,158

270
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,962
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

271

<i>( APPLAUSE )
 TIVAS TRIBE IS JUST ROCKING</i>

272
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,668
AND ROLLING, MAN.

273
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,404
WE WON BY A LANDSLIDE YET AGAIN.

274
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,173
THATS WHAT WE DO AS TEEF AS.

275
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,309
I JUST WANT TO EAT A PEPPER.

276
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,713
I MISS CAROL A LOT, BUT OTHER
THAN THAT, I DONT KNOW HOW I

277
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,381
COULD BE BLAIG THE GAME BETTER
RIGHT NOW.

278
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,949
OH, MY GOD!

279
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,417
I FOUND TWO IDOLS.

280
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,819
DONT EAT THE PEPPERS.

281
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,953
DONT EAT PEPPERS.

282
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,156
AND NOT ONLY THAT, YOU KNOW,
IVE INDOCTRINATED CHRISTIAN

283
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,862
WITH ME AND JOHN, MORE OF THE
BROCHACHOS.

284
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:15,234
I TRUST HIM MORE TO PROTECT ME
AND COVER MY BACK THAN I DO

285
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:15,768
GABBY.

286
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,537
WHAT A GREAT MEAL.

287
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,572
THERE YOU GO!

288
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,074
ALL RIGHT, BROCHACHOS!

289
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,610
WE FEED EACH OTHER THE WAY WE
NEED TO FEED EACH OTHER.

290
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,645
THATS AN EXPERIENCE I NEVER HAD
BEFORE.

291
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:33,853
ITS ACTUALLY A FIRST FOR ME,
TOO.

292
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,521
ILL REMEMBER THIS.

293
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,956
BROCHACHOS ARE TIGHT.

294
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,025
ITS AN INTERESTING
TRANSITION HAPPENING.

295
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,363
ME, THIS IDEA OF BEING THIS COOL
GUY, COOL TO HANGUTE WITH AROUND

296
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,297
CAMP.

297
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,833
I-- I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE THAT
GUY, YOU KNOW.

298
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,837
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE SOMEONE
THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO TALK TO.

299
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:57,376
ONE OF MY BIGGEST FEARS IN THIS
GAME AND OUTSIDE THIS GAME IS

300
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,880
BEING OSTRACIZED, YOU KNOW,
BEING LEFT OUT OF THE LOOP OF

301
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:05,217
FRIENDS, COLLEAGUES, AT A PARTY.

302
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:11,123
IM BECOMING THIS GOLIATH-LIKE
FIGURE FROM THESE DAVID ORIGINS.

303
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,727
THE FACT THAT I AM BECOMING THIS
PERSON PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK TO

304
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:22,401
AND HANG OUT WITH IS VALIDATION
THAT THIS WORK HAS BEEN PAYING

305
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:28,274
OFF, THIS SORT OF LIFETIME OF
SELF-IMPROVEMENT, IF YOU WILL.

306
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,744
THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT MAKE
DANCING COOL IS MISDIRECTION,

307
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,347
AND THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT IS
THE MOON WALK.

308
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:40,019
IF SOMEONE IS HAVING A SWEET
ROUTINE, THE WHOLE CROWD POPS

309
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,054
WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING
UNEXPECTED.

310
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,255
RIGHT.

311
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:47,059
I GUESS THATS LIKE MY POP AND
LOCK ADDS A VISUAL COMPELLING

312
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,260
ELEMENT TO IT, YEAH.

313
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,565
ITS OBVIOUS THESE GOLIATH
BOYS WOULD WRATH BRO DOWN WITH

314
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,800
CHRISTIAN AND LEAVE ME ON THE
OITS.

315
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,071
SO I NEED TO FIND A WAY TO TAKE
MY GAME INTO MY OWN HANDS.

316
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,005
BUT ITS SCARY!

317
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,173
ITS REALLY SCARY FOR ME.

318
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,577
I KNOW WE KEEP SAYING WE JUST
HAVE TO WIN, WE JUST HAVE TO

319
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,110
WIN.

320
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:05,611
BUT WHAT IF WE DONT?

321
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,812
WHAT IF WE DONT.

322
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,548
I KNOW IM ON THE BOTTOM, AND
I DONT WANT TO JUST LEAN ON

323
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,283
HOPE, HOPE THAT WE WILL WIN.

324
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,352
HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY.

325
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,554
THIS GAME IS ABOUT TAKING
CHANCES.

326
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,488
YEAH.

327
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:22,294
WHICH FREAKING SCARY, AND I--
I NEED YOU.

328
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,896
I DONT KNOW WHO I HAVE ANYMORE.

329
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,597
YEAH.

330
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,969
LIKE, I TRUST CHRISTIAN 100%.

331
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,872
AND I FEEL CONNECTED TO YOU,
MORE SO THAN JOHN AND DAN.

332
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,673
I CANT WORK WITH DAN.

333
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,843
DAN DOESNT TALK TO ME ABOUT
STRATEGY, SO, LIKE, YOURE THE

334
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,678
ONLY PERSON THATS TALKED
STRATEGY TO ME.

335
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,548
I, LIKE, DONT WANT TO GET
EMOTIONAL BECAUSE THIS IS SO

336
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,782
LAME BUT--
 I KNOW.

337
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,720
ITS REALLY SCARY BEING ON
THE BOTTOM AND, LIKE, AND, LIKE,

338
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,790
YOURE THE ONLY PERSON THAT
EXTENDED AN OLIVE BRANCH TO ME

339
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,025
AND CHRISTIAN.

340
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,529
AND, LIKE, I WANTED TO PLAY IT
COOL, BUT, LIKE, I JUST HAVE TO,

341
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,564
LIKE, PUT MYSELF OUT THERE.

342
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,665
I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

343
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,233
I KNOW YOU HAVE MORE TO LOSE.

344
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,637
SEEING HER TEAR UP, SHE JUST
CUT TO MY CORE.

345
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,306
I AM AN EXTRAORDINARILY
EMPATHETIC PERSON.

346
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,743
THAT IS KIND OF MY GREATEST GIFT
AS A DOCTOR, SO WHEN I SEE

347
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:14,647
SOMEONE EMOTIONAL, MY FIRST
INSTINCT IS TO ALLEVIATE THEIR

348
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,447
SUFFERING.

349
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,750
SHE IS PUTTING A LOT OF TRUST IN
ME.

350
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,886
AND I THINK GABBY IS SOMEONE
THAT I CAN TRUST LONG TERM.

351
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,823
I THINK THIS GAME SHOULDNT BE
DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH.

352
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,691
YEAH.

353
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,359
I THINK IT SHOULD BE WHO DO
YOU TRUST?

354
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,463
SO IF IT WERE TO COME TO A
TRIBAL COUNCIL, IM TRYING TO

355
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:38,003
PLAY AS MUCH WITH JOHN AND DAN,
BUT THEN BLINDSIDING DAN.

356
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,905
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

357
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,709
I IDENTIFY DAN AS A THREAT.

358
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:48,380
ON THE OTHER HAND, I FEEL LIKE
YOU, ME, AND CHRISTIAN ARE MUCH

359
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,848
MORE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.

360
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,686
AND, HONESTLY, LIKE HEART AND
HEAD TELL ME TO GO WITH YOU AND

361
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:53,986
CHRISTIAN.

362
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,154
OKAY.

363
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:59,191
EVERY DAY, THE LINE BETWEEN
DAVID AND GOLIATH ARE BLURRING

364
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,359
MORE AND MORE.

365
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,062
WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU
THINK ABOUT WHO IS THE BIGGEST

366
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,596
THREAT, IT PROBABLY IS DAN.

367
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,399
HE HAS THIS BROCHACHO THING
GOING ALONG.

368
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,002
ITS A LITTLE BIT OF A BOYS
CLUB.

369
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:14,606
AND NOT ONLY THAT, HE HAS AN
IDOL IN HIS POCKET, AND THAT

370
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,808
SCARES ME.

371
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:19,845
SO NOW THE QUESTION IS LESS
BECOMING DO I BLINDSIDE DAN AND

372
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:28,687
MORE BECOMING WHEN?

373
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,824
BREATHE IN AND OIT.

374
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,158
GO OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

375
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,460
OUT?

376
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,361
 NOT QUITE AS CLOSE TO MY

377
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:35,661
SPINE.

378
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,228
OKAY.

379
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,330
OKAY.

380
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,866
FOUR WEEKS BEFORE I CAME OUT
HERE I COULDNT WALK BECAUSE MY

381
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,067
BACK WAS HURTING SO BAD.

382
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,604
I SUFFERED THROUGH THE FIRST 16
DAYS OF THIS ON THAT STUPID

383
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:50,075
BAMBOO, AND ITS TAKING A TOLL
ON ME MENTALLY NOT BEING ABLE TO

384
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,243
SLEEP.

385
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,379
EVERYBODY KEEPS TALKING ABOUT
WANTING TO GET THIS BED MORE

386
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,015
COMFORTABLE BY SPLITTING THE
BAMBOO WHERE THEYRE ALL LEVEL.

387
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,618
ITS DAY 16 AND AINT NOBODY
DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT.

388
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,854
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

389
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,723
I WANT TO DO IT NOW, AND IT
NEEDS TO BE DIDNT RIGHT WAY.

390
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,024
YOU READY?

391
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:17,436
YEAH.

392
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:23,042
I SEE ELISABETH AND KARA
START CHOPPING BAMBOO IN HALF.

393
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,343
ITS GOING TO BE DARK SOON.

394
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,844
THATS NOT A HALF-DAY PROJECT.

395
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,246
ITS A WHOLE-DAY PROJECT.

396
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,014
AND IM LIKE OH!

397
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,715
HOLD ON!

398
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:34,987
PUMP THE BRAKES!

399
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,822
I CANT SLEEP ON IT.

400
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,057
MY BACK IS KILLING ME.

401
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,826
IF WE WAS GOING TO START IT,
WE SHOULD START THAT EARLY IN

402
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,394
THE MORNING.

403
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,732
WE CANT START IT WHEN WE AINT
GOT BUT TWO HOURS OF DAYLIGHT

404
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,266
LEFT.

405
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,667
WE HAD A WHOLE DAY.

406
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,638
WERE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL DAY 39
TO FIX OUR FREAKING BED.

407
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,141
THERE ARE TWO THINGS IN LIFE I
DONT LIKE, LAZY PEOPLE AND

408
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,042
STUPID PEOPLE.

409
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,111
WHY ARE YOU SLOWING THE SPLIT
ONE AWAY.

410
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,380
I TOOK ALL THE HALF ONES OFF.

411
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,648
ITS A MISTAKE.

412
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,717
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PERSON IF I
CARE ABOUT SOMETHING I CANT LET

413
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,952
GO.

414
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:12,991
SO WHEN IM IRRITATED, LIKE I AM
RIGHT NOW, EVERYBODYS ALREADY

415
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:23,068
GOING TO KNOW IT.

416
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:28,941
GOING TO KNOW IT.

417
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:29,174
AAAAHHH!

418
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,548
YOU OKAY?

419
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,183
YEAH, IM GREAT.

420
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,285
YOU GOT AN ISSUE?

421
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,221
 YEAH, I GOT ISSUES.

422
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,422
LET IT OUT.

423
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,389
THERETO OUT RIGHT NOW.

424
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,358
I JUST EYE JUST NEED TO GET
THIS OUT, OKAY?

425
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,460
GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.

426
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:53,065
FOUR WEEKS BEFORE I CAME TO
"SURVIVOR," I COULD NOT GET UP

427
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,902
OUT OF BED TO GO TO THE FREAKING
BATHROOM BY MYSELF.

428
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,570
MY BACK WAS IN SUCH BAD SHAPE.

429
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:03,642
AND I AM NOT A WI WUSS, OKAY?

430
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,045
NO ONE IS SAYING YOURE A
WUSS.

431
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,314
I JUST NEED TO LISTEN FOR
JUST A SECOND, OKAY?

432
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,917
AND I HAVE BEEN SUFFERING ON
THIS BAMBOO SINCE I HAVE BEEN

433
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,586
HERE AND I HAVENT SAID ONE WORD
ABOUT IT, EXCEPT FOR THROWING

434
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,421
OUT IDEAS.

435
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,124
I AM IN CONSTANT PAIN.

436
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,060
AND I GOT TIRED OF BEING PATIENT
WAITING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO

437
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,729
HELP MAKE A BED MORE
COMFORTABLE.

438
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:27,799
AND ITS JUST REALLY FRUSTRATING
TO START TAKING IT APART AND PUT

439
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,369
IT BACK TOGETHER YOUR WAY
WITHOUT INVOLVE MEEG IN THE

440
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,270
PROCESS.

441
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,838
SO IT WASNT LIKE IT WAS A GROUP
DECISION.

442
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,673
A GROUP DECISION?

443
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,941
WERE GOING THERE?

444
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,610
IT WASNT A GROUP DECISION TO
TAKE IT APART.

445
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:43,348
FOR ONE, EVIDENCE LAYING ON
THE BED TRYING TO GET SOME LEAP,

446
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:47,519
AND IM WOKEN UP TO THE FREAKING
BAMBOO BEING SAWED IN HALF.

447
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,190
WITH THE DAVIDS I THOUGHT
THEY HAD THIS COWBOY HAT

448
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,494
CONVENTION BUT, APPARENTLY,
THERES SOME KIND OF RIFT THERE.

449
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,229
AS MUCH AS I HATE CONFLICTS
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE IT ALSO MAKES

450
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:01,900
ME SIT BACK AND EAT MY POPCORN
KNOWING ITS NOT GOING TO BE ME.

451
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,869
IM SORRY I AM BEING A JERK
ABOUT IT.

452
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:04,503
I REALLY AM.

453
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,305
BUT ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING.

454
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,541
THINGS CHANGE EVERY SINGLE
SECOND IN THIS GAME SO WHERE THE

455
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,678
PERSON YOU WERE TIGHT WITH GOT
UNDER YOUR SKIN.

456
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,913
AS FAR AS ELISABETH GOES, WE
TEND TO CLASH.

457
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,715
SHES A KNOW-IT-ALL.

458
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:21,520
AND I DONT DO WELL WITH
KNOW-IT-ALLS AT THIS PARTICULAR

459
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,823
POINT, IF WE WERE TO LOSE I
WOULD TRY TO GET RID OF

460
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,858
ELIZABETH.

461
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:43,508

CARL MAKES ME COME GET IT.

467
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,033

00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,701
DONT WANT TO GIVE IT UP.

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,527
SHOULD WE GO BACK?

524
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,163
NO, NO, NO.

525
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,464
THEYRE GOING TO SPILL IT.

526
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,134
Jeff: YOURE GOING TO LOSE
SOME WATER ALONG THE WAY.

527
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,402
UP TO THE FILL THAT BABY.

528
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,170
THE MORE WATER YOU HAVE WHEN YOU
GET TO THE WELL, THE FEWER TRIPS

529
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,405
YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE.

530
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,139
WE HAVE TO GO UP A LITTLE
BIT.

531
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,808
Jeff: AND A BIG TROP BY
VUKU.

532
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,109
THEY LOST HALF THEIR SAUCER.

533
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,411
BE CAREFUL!

534
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,278
BE CAREFUL!

535
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,046
OKAY, ROTATE.

536
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,182
Jeff: NOW IT GETS
COMPLICATED.

537
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,316
YOU HAVE THREE BEAMS.

538
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,419
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY ON
EVERY BEAM WHILE BALANCING A

539
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,722
SAUCER WITH WATER THAT YOU
DESPERATELY NEED TO FILL THAT

540
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,489
WELL.

541
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,358
THIS IS WHERE TEAM WORK IS
CRUCIAL!

542
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,861
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

543
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,397
Jeff: JABENI LOSES NEARLY
EVERYTHING.

544
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,833
FUT UP AGAINST THAT THING AND
WE TIP UP.

545
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,834
SO PUT THAT THERE.

546
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,136
Jeff: THATS HOW DO YOU IT
RIGHT THERE, TIVA.

547
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,106
TIVA BACK, THEYRE GOING TO FILL
UP THEIR WELL.

548
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,275
WOW, TIVA DOES IT.

549
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,277
THEYVE DROPPED THEIR PUZZLE
PIECES.

550
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,645
GOOD JOB, TIVA!

551
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,914
Jeff: VUKUS GOT TO HELP
BACK.

552
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,849
GOOD LEAD, TIVA!

553
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:14,519
Jeff: TIVA DID A NICE JOB
IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTING WATER.

554
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,689
AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE
DIFFERENCE EARLY IN THIS

555
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,290
CHALLENGE.

556
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,459
VUKU HAVING TO HEAD BACK.

557
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,961
JABENI DEFINITELY HAVING TO HEAD
BACK.

558
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,230
THEY BARELY HAVE ANY WATER IN
THEIR SAUCER.

559
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:29,935
IT IS CHRISTIAN AND ALISON
WORKING ON THE PUZZLE FOR TIVA.

560
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,304
THEY HAVE YET TO GO TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

561
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,774
LETS TRADE OUT THE ONES THAT
ARE NOT EDGE PIECES AND PUT THEM

562
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,741
OVER HERE.

563
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,878
Jeff: HERE COMES VUKU AND
HERE COMES JABENI.

564
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:45,750
IT HAS BEEN A NORMAL STORY FOR
JABENI TO BE DEAD LAST BUT THEY

565
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,252
HAVE PULLED CHALLENGES OUT IN
THE PAST.

566
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,920
CAN THEY DO IT AGAIN.

567
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,256
JABENI ALREADY EXHAUSTED EARLY
IN THE CHALLENGE BUT THEY ARE

568
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,058
NOT GIVING UP.

569
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,392
YEAH!

570
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,695
Jeff: VUKU DROPS THEIR
PUZZLE PIECES!

571
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,629
THEYRE GOOD.

572
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,165
ITS NOW JABENI STILL STRUGGLING
TO GET BACK.

573
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,299
YOU OKAY?

574
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:06,538
YEAH, MY ARM --
 LITERALLY TAKING A STOP TO

575
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:07,172
REST.

576
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,240
KARA HAS THE PUZZLE PIECES.

577
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,276
ITS GOING TO BE KARA AND ALEC
SOLVING THE PUZZ PEL.

578
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,911
LETS GO, VUKU!

579
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,312
Jeff: HERE COMES JABENI.

580
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,415
THEY NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH WATER
TO FILL THAT WELL AND IT DOES

581
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,085
NOT LOOK GOOD AND THEYVE LOST
WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE AGAIN.

582
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,119
GOT ONE!

583
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,955
Jeff: ALISON AND CHRISTIAN
DOING A NICE JOB.

584
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,124
THEY ARE CLOSING IN ON IMMUNITY.

585
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,894
ALEC AND KARA CONTINUE TO WORK
TOGETHER WELL.

586
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,630
JABENI BACK WITH ANOTHER SAUCER
FULL OF WATER, TRYING TO GET IT

587
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,831
ALL IN.

588
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,535
A LOT OF IT IS SPLASHING OUT,
HOPING IT WILL DROP THE PUZZLE

589
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:36,968
PIECES.

590
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:37,969
REALLY?

591
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:38,703
ONE MORE.

592
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:39,571
Jeff: NO.

593
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,539
WOW.

594
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:46,044
Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, JABENI
HAS TO HEAD BACK.

595
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,280
JABENI LOOKS LIKE THEYRE ON
THE EDGE OF GIVING UP.

596
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,648
WERE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

597
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,517
 NOPE, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

598
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,585
Jeff: YOURE CLOSE.

599
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,619
ONE MORE SAUCER WILL DO IT.

600
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,854
ALL RIGHT.

601
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,223
Jeff: CHRISTIAN WITH
ANOTHER PIECE.

602
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,724
ALISON WITH ONE MORE.

603
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,826
TIVA CLOSING IN ON ANOTHER
IMMUNITY WIN.

604
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,428
KEEPING THEM SAFE IN THE GAME.

605
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,629
VUKU NOT FAR BEHIND.

606
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,231
GUYS, GUYS!

607
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:10,035
Jeff: WE ARE CLOSE TO A
"SURVIVOR" BLOWOUT RIGHT NOW.

608
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,939
ALISON WITH THE NEXT-TO-LAST
PIECE.

609
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,508
ALISON AND CHRISTIAN GOING TO DO
IT TOGETHER.

610
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,542
THERE IT IS!

611
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,279
TIVA WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE AGAIN
FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL!

612
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:27,485
IT IS NOW A STORY OF VUKU VERSUS
JABENI.

613
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,455
IT WOULD BE AN IMPOSSIBLE
COMEBACK AT THIS POINT FOR

614
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:31,056
JABENI.

615
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,558
AND YET THEY STILL FIGHT.

616
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,859
THEIR HEART IS IN IT.

617
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,128
THEY JUST CANT GET THE
PERFORMANCE TO MATCH.

618
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,697
LET GO, LET GO.

619
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,633
IF WEVE GOT A CHANCE IN
HELL, WE GOTTA GO.

620
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:45,337
IM JUST TELLING YOU IF I GO
I MIGHT DROP IT.

621
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,272
IM JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT
TOGETHER, DUDE.

622
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,440
LETS GO, LETS GO.

623
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,608
WE HAVE TO.

624
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,278
Jeff: SOMETIMES THERE IS
JUST NOWHERE TO HIDE ON

625
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:53,979
"SURVIVOR."

626
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,046
YOU EITHER HAVE IT OR YOU DONT.

627
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,315
AND RIGHT NOW, JABENI IS NOWHERE
CLOSE TO HAVING IT.

628
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,618
ALEC AND KARA TAKING THEIR TIME.

629
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,987
NO RUSH.

630
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,023
JABENI STILL FIGHTING.

631
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:08,159
THAT "SURVIVOR" SPIRIT IS WHAT
GOT YOU OUT HERE, AND ITS WHAT

632
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,361
KEEPS YOU OUT HERE.

633
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,829
ONE MORE TIME.

634
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,130
OH GOD!

635
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,099
YOU OKAY?

636
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,233
YOU OKAY?

637
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,569
Jeff: JABENI, JUST WHEN
THEY WERE BACK WITH THEIR LAST

638
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:21,039
SAUCER FULL OF WATER, LITERALLY
DROPPED THE SAUCER.

639
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,742
I MEAN, WE-- THERES NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

640
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,711
Jeff: ALEC WITH THE
NEXT-TO-LAST PIECE FOR VUKU.

641
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,348
DO THE PLEA OF US WANT TO TRY
TO LIFT IT UP.

642
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,650
THEYRE DONE.

643
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,784
THEY HAVE ONE PIECE LEFT.

644
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,286
Jeff: KARA WITH THE FINAL
PIECE SECURING IMMUNITY FOR

645
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,187
VUKU.

646
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,255
VUKU WINS EU78 IMMUNITY.

647
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,790
SAFE FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL.

648
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,625
JABENI KNOWS WHATS COMING.

649
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:45,530

TIVA AND VUKU NICE JOB.

GRAB YOUR STUFF.

660
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,553

IM SORERY.

665
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,428
SORRY.

666
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,964
Jeff: MIKE, ONE OF THE
THINGS ABOUT "SURVIVOR" IS YOU

667
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,666
CANT PREPARE FOR EVERY
CHALLENGE.

668
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,470
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE,
BUT ITS NOT INDICATIVE OF A

669
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,705
TERRIBLE TRIBE.

670
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,340
WHAT KEPT YOU GOING WHEN IT WAS
CLEAR THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR

671
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,243
YOU GUYS TO WIN?

672
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:37,182
( SIGHS )
 ITS ALL RIGHT.

673
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,586
I JUST KNOW THIS IS AN
IMPORTANT ELIMINATION.

674
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:45,056
AND I DONT WANT ANY OF US TO GO
HOME.

675
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,928
AND-- AND SO I THINK ALL OF US
WERE PUTTING BEST EFFORTS, EVEN

676
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:53,598
THOUGH WE WERE OUT-GUNNED, BUT
IM PROUD OF EVERY ONE OF THEM

677
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,000
AND I JUST FEEL BAD THEY
COULDNT DO MORE.

678
00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:01,639
Jeff: IT IS ONLY DAY 17,
BUT 17 DAYS IS ALL IT WILL BE

679
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,941

687
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,989
I KNOW HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO
THEM, AND I DONT LIKE THE IDEA

688
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,591
OF DASHING DREAMS.

689
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:27,232
SO TO HAVE ONE OF THEM GO
HOME... ISNT-- ISNT-- ISNT AS

690
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,268
FUN AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

691
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,322
IT WAS SO HARD.

692
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,758
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE OTHER
TEAMS LOOKED LIKE,

693
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,994
MFERL-BOUND...

694
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:59,831
THEY GOT IT, IN, LIKE, TWO
MINUTES GEE,Y KNOW.

695
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:04,335
IM SOR SORRY ONE OF US HAS
TO LEAVE.

696
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,570
WE DID ALL WE COULD.

697
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,038
I REALLY WANTED ALL FOUR OF
US TO MAKE THE NEXT STAEJ OF THE

698
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:10,375
GAME WHICH IM HOPING IS A
MERGE, BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS IS

699
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,911
THE MOST MOMENTUM VOTE OF THE
GAME SO FAR.

700
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,680
WE HAVE SEVEN GOLIATHS, SEVEN
DAVIDS.

701
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,483
WERE HERE ON A TRIBE WITH TWO
GOLIATHS AND TWO DAEFDS.

702
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:22,187
ITS NOT JUST SOMEBODY GOING
HOME.

703
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,689
WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY IS GOING
TO IMPACT EVERYBODYS GENTLEMAN

704
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,926
FOR THE REST OF THE GAME.

705
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,963
YEAH.

706
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:38,603
I MEAN, PERSONALLY, LIKE, I
WOULD LOVE TO JUST PARTY WITH

707
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,038
YOU ON THIS GAME.

708
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,005
SO--
 YEAH.

709
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,041
AND I KNOW YOU WOULD BE LOYAL
TO, LIKE, US.

710
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,609
AND I KNOW YOU WANT IT.

711
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,078
YOU BRING A LOT TO THE TEAM.

712
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:52,150
I REALLY DONT KNOW WHY
ANGELINA THINKS I WOULD BE

713
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:57,422
WILLING TO WORK WITH HER AFTER
THE JACKET THING.

714
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,022
CRAZY.

715
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:58,990
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

716
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:03,995
I MEAN, ILL STICK WITH NICK.

717
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:09,634
SO I THINK MAYBE ITS GONNA BE,
LIKE, A TIE OR SOMETHING.

718
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,804
COMING BACK FROM THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, EVIDENCE ACTUALLY

719
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,541
FEELING PRETTY OPEN MINDED TO
WORKING WITH LYRSA, GIVEN THAT

720
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,243
WERE BOTH LATINAS.

721
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,778
BUT IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS NO
ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION OR

722
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,680
COMPROMISE OR CONSIDERATION.

723
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,450
AND SO, THAT PUT THE NAIL IN HER
COFFIN.

724
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,620
IT WILL ABSOLUTELY BE LYRSA
TONIGHT.

725
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,287
ITS THURSDAY.

726
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,355
WE HAVE TO VOTE HER OUT.

727
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,489
FOR SURE.

728
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,924
YOU THINK NICK IS WITH US?

729
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,726
YEAH.

730
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,962
I MEAN, NO ONES GOING TO WANT
TO GO TO ROCKS.

731
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,131
NO ONE WANTS TO GO TO ROCKS.

732
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,399
AND WE GUARANTEE HIM SAFETY.

733
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,401
ALL RIGHT, SO WE NEED TO WORK ON
NICK TODAY.

734
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,102
OH, YEAH.

735
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,570
THEY ARE STICKING TOGETHER.

736
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,171
THATS WHAT THEY JUST TOLD
YOU?

737
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:52,777
YEAH.

738
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,147
I THINK WEVE GOT A CHANCE IF WE
CAN JUST GET TO THEM.

739
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,019
RIGHT NOW, MY LIFE IN THIS
GAME AND IN DAVID AS A NUMBER IS

740
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,788
HANGING BY A THREAD, AND MIKE IS
HOLDING IT.

741
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,758
WE NEED TO CONVINCE HIM TO
FINALLY VOTE ANGELINA OUT, BUT

742
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:10,395
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT,
SHES NOT GETTING MY JACKET.

743
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,398
I WILL MAYBE OFFER ONE OF MY
SOCKS AND JUST BECAUSE IT HAS A

744
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,933
HOLE IN IT.

745
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,868
I REALLY WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU,
MEEK.

746
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,003
IM JUST TELLING YOU THAT IM
REAL--

747
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,238
I KNOW YOU ARE.

748
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,372
AND I REALLY WANT TO STAY.

749
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,607
Y KNOW.

750
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,043
THE THING IS FOR ME, WHATEVER
HESITATION I HAVE HAS NOTHING TO

751
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,812
DO WITH YOU VERSUS ANGELINA.

752
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,213
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE GOLIATHS.

753
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,382
SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU
KNOW, I THINK YOU, ME, AND MEEK

754
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,885
ARE SUCHS GOOD TRIO TOGETHER.

755
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,688
SINCE DAY ONE I FELT REALLY
SOLID WITH YOU.

756
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:37,055
YEAH.

757
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:37,822
YOU KNOW.

758
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,891
I DONT HAVE ANY LOYALTY TO
HER.

759
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,760
SHES JUST NONSTOP STRATEGIC.

760
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,363
IT WOULD BE SO CRAZY.

761
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,732
I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU LONG
TERM.

762
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,766
UH-HUH.

763
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,135
I KNOW YOU AND MIKE WILL
PROBABLY STICK TOGETHER NO

764
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,072
MATTER WHAT, BUT I MEAN, I CANT
DO THAT WITH LYRSA.

765
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,373
YEAH.

766
00:32:55,406 --> 00:33:00,044
FOR HER TO GO OUT NOW, SHED
BE SO PISSED.

767
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,814
CAN I ASK FOR HER SOCKS?

768
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,748
AND HER COAT?

769
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,683
Y REALLY WANT THAT COAT.

770
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,986
WELL, IM DOWN.

771
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,321
OH, MY GOD, ANGELINAS GOING TO
BE SO MAD AT ME.

772
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,091
YEAH, IT SUCKS TO SEE HER GO.

773
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,860
I LIKE HER, YOU KNOW, BUT WE
WERENT SUPER TEAT OR ANYTHING.

774
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,495
THERES NO QUESTION IN ME
MEEND.

775
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:21,065
YEAH.

776
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:27,138
I DONT HAVE ANY DESIRE TO WORK
WITH YAG AS FAR AS I CAN THROW

777
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,006
HER.

778
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,173
SHE THINKS SHES RUNNING THE
WHOLE SHOW.

779
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,575
AND THATS NOT TRUE AT ALL.

780
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,878
THE TRUTH IS ILL PROBABLY
DISCUSS IT WITH MIKE, MY FELLOW

781
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:37,982
ROCK STAR, AND WHATEVER WE THINK
SUITS US BEST IS WHAT WE WILL

782
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,216
DO.

783
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:46,691
.

784
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,627
YEAH, AND ITS GOOD FOR YOUR
GAME.

785
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,297
MY GAME IS MORE-- HERES THE
THING, IF THE DAEFDZ GET

786
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:57,101
TOGETHER AND START PICKING OFF
GOLIATH AFTER GOLIATH AFTER

787
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,936
GOLIATH, IM JUST BONING MY OWN
GAME.

788
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,771
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

789
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,572
I DO HAVE A LOT OF FAEGHT IN
MIKE.

790
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:02,507
AND TRUST HIM.

791
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,976
AT THIS POINT I FEEL LIKE MIKES
BEST FRIEND.

792
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,780
I THINK WE COULD GO DEEP IN THIS
NF THIS GAME AND HAVE FUN

793
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,547
PLAYING IT.

794
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,351
MY JOB IS TO CONVINCE MIKE.

795
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,752
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEST FOR
US?

796
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,021
THE SAFE PART OF ME SAYS
LYRSA.

797
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:17,922
UH-HUH.

798
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,258
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE LYRSAS
NOT, LIKE--

799
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,060
SHES NOT GOING TO BE A
THREAT TO ANYBODY.

800
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:26,030
AND, ALSO, I DO THINK THERE
IS SOME UP SIDE TO VOTING OUT

801
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:26,731
ANGELINA.

802
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,800
SO IM REALLY-- IM REALLY TORN.

803
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,936
ITS ALMOST LIKE A FREE SHOT
TO TAKE OUT A BIG THREAT.

804
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,672
IM REALLY STRUGGLING WITH
WHICH WAY TO GO.

805
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:37,775
I REALLY TRUST LYRSA IN A WAY I
JUST DONT TRUST ANGELINA.

806
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,479
I MEAN, THIS IS NOT A PLAYER TO
BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

807
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,713
SHE IS HERE TO WIN.

808
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,484
SHE IS THE CEEND OF PERSON TO
TURN ON AND AND YOU NEVER KNOW.

809
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,654
BUT BY VOTING HER OUT, AM I
SCREWING EVERY GOLIATH LEFT IN

810
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,855
THE GAME.

811
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,558
THE TRUTH, IS I LIKE A LOT OF
THE GOLIATHS LEFT IN THE GAME.

812
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,594
MY GUT SAYS LYRSA ONE MINUTE AND
ANGELINA THE NEXT MINUTE.

813
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:00,031
LIKE, I FEEL A CHOKER ON MY NECK
AND, LIKE, ITS GETTING TIGHTER

814
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:00,932
AND TEETER.

815
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,600
YOU KNOW, THE CLOCK IS
TICKING.

816
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,636
IVE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION.

817
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:24,622
♪ ♪
 Jeff: NICK, I WAS STRUCK AT

818
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:42,406
THE END OF THE CHALLENGE BY THE
CLEAR BOND THE FOUR OF YOU HAD.

819
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,108
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?

820
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,443
I AM SURPRISED.

821
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,312
I MEAN, I DONT KNOW IF ITS THE
STRUGGLES THAT THIS GROUP HAS

822
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,483
GONE THROUGH TOGETHER, BUT,
YEAH, TODAY WHEN WE LOST I

823
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,484
WASNT THINKING ABOUT ME.

824
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,219
I WAS THINKING, MAN, ONE OF US
HAS TO GO HOME.

825
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,221
Jeff: SO, MIKE, IS THERE
ANYTHING TO THE DAVID-DPLGHT OR

826
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,224
IS THAT OUT THE WINDOW AND ITS
NOW JUST PEOPLE?

827
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,359
THERES NO WRONG ANSWER HERE.

828
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,495
I THINK ALL FOUR OF US ARE
STRONG PLAYERS.

829
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,498
WED BE LUCKY TO HAVE AN
ALLIANCE WITH ANY OF US.

830
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,635
Jeff: SO WHATS THE
CRITERIA RIGHT NOW FOR TONIGHTS

831
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,836
VOTE?

832
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,705
WELL, IF THERE IS A MERGE, WE
ARE THINKING ABOUT WHO DO WE

833
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,075
TRUST TO HELP US NAVIGATE THAT
NEXT TREACHEROUS PART OF THE

834
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,277
GAME.

835
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,879
Jeff: LYRSA, IS THAT WHAT
IT IS FOR YOU, TRUST AND LOYALTY

836
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,114
FROM HEREON OUT?

837
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,850
YEAH, TO ME IT HAS BEEN FROM
THE GET-GO OF THE GAME, TRYING

838
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:29,020
TO MAKE BONDS WITH PEOPLE THAT
WILL STAY LOYAL TO ME.

839
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,822
AND THE BONDS THAT I CREATED
WITH THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE

840
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,560
STRONGER THAN WHAT WE HAD WITH
THE PEOPLE THAT WE PLAYED

841
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,761
BEFORE.

842
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,963
Jeff: ANGELINA, TRUST AND
LOYALTY NUMBER ONE FOR YOU RIGHT

843
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,298
NOW, LOOKING AHEAD?

844
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,366
TRUST, LOYALTY, AND STRATEGY.

845
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,834
Jeff: HOW SO?

846
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,238
ILL GET THERE.

847
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,908
I ADD STRATEGY BECAUSE IF THERE
IS MERGE, YOU HAVE TO THINK

848
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,610
ABOUT WHO DO I TRUST?

849
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,811
WHO TRUSTS ME?

850
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:57,815
AND WHO MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO
BE CONNECTED WITH ME IN THIS

851
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:58,983
GAME.

852
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,752
Jeff: NICK, IS THIS A BIT
OF A ROLL OF THE DICE THAT "I

853
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,322
HOPE WERE MAKING THE RIGHT
DECISION AND IF WE MERGE OUR

854
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,657
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS
HAPPENING ARE CORRECT?"

855
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,525
ABSOLUTELY.

856
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,160
IT WOULD BE LIKE A WAR COMING
IN.

857
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,530
AND RIGHT NOW IM PICKING THE
BROTHERS AND SISTERS IM

858
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,166
FIGHTING BESIDE AND FIGHTING
WITH, NOT FEETING AGAIN.

859
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,101
ILL CUT TO THE CHASE, JEFF.

860
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,404
AS THE UNDERDOG IN THESE THREE
TRIBES WE HAD TO PREPARE FOR THE

861
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,207
WORST, AND THE THE WORST IS
COMING HERE AGAIN TONIGHT WITH

862
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,375
FOUR PLAYERS.

863
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,978
THAT BEING SAID, WE WOULDNT
HAVE MADE THE MOVE ON NATALIE

864
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,447
LAST TRIBAL IF WE DIDNT HAVE A
PLAN.

865
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,750
AND IM REALLY HOPING THAT THAT
IS WHAT WE STEK TO TONIGHT.

ULTIMATE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH.

00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,701
SO I HOPE THAT MY PLAN, WHICH IS
BASED ON LOYALTY AND TRUTH,

871
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,869
MOVES FORWARD IN THE GAME.

872
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,838
Jeff: NICK, DO YOU HAVE A
PLAN?

873
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,206

FOR ME PERSONALLY, IM HERE FOR
THIS TRIBE.

877
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,646
THE DAVID AND GOLIATH STUFF IS
OVER.

878
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,048
Jeff: YOUR PITCH IS I DONT
CARE ABOUT TRIBAL ALLIANCES?

879
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,182
ABSOLUTELY.

880
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,184
Jeff: TO GET RID OF ME
WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE MISTAKE.

881
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,719
IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE.

882
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,888
YOUD BE WASTING A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU CAN USE

883
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,123
LATER IN THE GAME.

884
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,591
ILL GO TO BAT FOR NICK.

885
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,126
CAN I JUMP IN?

886
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:15,526
IS THAT OKAY?

887
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,694
YEAH, SURE.

888
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,096
I THINK NICK IS SOMEONE WHO
IS A PLEASURE TO BE AROUND.

889
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,264
HE HELPS AROUND CAMP.

890
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,335
YOU CAN LOOK INTO HIS, LIKE,
PIERCING, WILSON BLUE EYES AND

891
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,537
YOU CAN SEE WHAT HES THINKING.

892
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,841
TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO BRINGS THAT
HONOR TO THE GAME IS-- IS SUPER

893
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,143
VALUABLE.

894
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,246
AND SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT
TO WHAT YOU ALREADY SAID.

895
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,380
I APPRECIATE THAT.

896
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,815
YEAH, OF COURSE.

897
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:41,385
Jeff: LYRSA, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT, VERY FLATTERING.

898
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,953
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

899
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,756
I THINK ITS TRYING TO BUY HIS
VOTE AND VOTE AGAINST SOMEONE

900
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,524
ELSE.

901
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,192
I AM NERVOUS THAT IT MIGHT BE
ME.

902
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,329
ALL I CAN SAY IT IM BEING
HONEST WITH PEOPLE.

903
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,965
WHEN YOU TELL YOU IM GOING TO
BE WITH YOU TO THE END I WILL BE

904
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,534
WITH YOU TO THE END.

905
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,536
I DONT HAVE A REASON TO LIE
HERE.

906
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,304
THATS THE WAY I CARRY MYSELF IN
THE GAME.

907
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,273
Jeff: WHATS THE RISK WITH
TONIGHTS VOTE, MIKE?

908
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,575
WHAT IF YOU GUYS GET IT WRONG?

909
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,810
( SIGHS ).

910
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,313
WELL, IF WE GET IT WRONG, MY
HOPE IS THAT ITS NOT A FATAL

911
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,448
MISTAKE.

912
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,150
I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY
TRUSTS EACH OTHER AND MAYBE

913
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,787
THATS GOING TO END UP BEING ONE
PERSONS PROBLEM TONIGHT.

914
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:20,624
BUT OUR DECISION TONIGHT IS NOT
JUST GOING TO IMPACT OUR GAMES

00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,374
HOPING THAT THE 24TH ARE AS
LOYAL AS THEY SAY THEY ARE.
