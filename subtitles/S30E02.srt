00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,800
18 new castaways 
were divided into three tribes.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,300
White Collars, Overalls 
and Colorless.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome to 
Survivor: War of the Worlds!

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,500
Among the Colorless, 
it was only harmony

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,300
and open arms.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,000
I am completely deaf.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,000
We are a team, we support you.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,200
But Joe's popularity 
began to irritate Vince.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,300
- Do we mount this and make the frame? 
- I do not think so.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,700
That Joe only wants to do this 
his own way is surely going to cause concern.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,700
Among the Bleus de Travail, 
only the effort counted.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,300
In one sentence: 
the Blues work tear everything.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,600
They made a fire...

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,100
...and even found something to eat.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
Did you eat a scorpion?

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,500
Only one thing was wrong: 
Dan's personality.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,600
I am fat. 
The bamboo will break and we will fall.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
It climbs quickly in the towers.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,200
He's the only one 
who doesn't belong here.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,900
Among the White Collars, 
business came first.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,700
- My name is Max. 
- Joaquin. Marketing director.

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,900
But bosses without employees 
didn't work.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,900
No one knows how to make a fire.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,400
Why would we know? 
We hire an overall for that.

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,900
At the immunity test, the difficulties 
continued for the Whites.

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,100
The Blues win 
immunity and reward,

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,900
sending White Collars to the council!

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,800
And at the first tip,

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
So, Joaquin's ally, 
was the first eliminated.

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,500
So, the tribe has spoken.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No doubt: 
you are players.

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,100
The question is: are you playing well? 
Was it the right decision?

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
The future will tell.

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,800
There are 17 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
You just break it.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,700
And you empty it.

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,800
Dan! I don't know what you're doing, 
but come eat some crabs!

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,800
I'm in the water, 
the underpants around one leg,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,600
relieving myself, 
a wave comes,

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,200
I had to hold on with both hands 
to not fall head first...

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,600
- Have you lost your swimming trunks? 
- ...and I lost my slibard.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,900
- You lost your underwear. 
- I lost my slibard.

45
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,700
Dan lost his underpants

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,400
and made himself 
a makeshift underpants,

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,100
with the belt around the...

48
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,000
...cut,

49
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,400
his shirt folded so that we 
can't see his ass or his penis.

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,500
- Did he really slip off your leg? 
- Not slipped, ripped off.

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,100
- So you don't have a shirt anymore? 
- Not on your back.

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,800
- You're going to burn. 
- It's clear.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
- Would you like me to leave? 
- Nope.

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,200
But you could put on your jeans.

55
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,900
I can't run in jeans, 
it would be a massacre.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,300
- I'm dreaming, huh? 
- It's real.

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,600
Please wake me up!

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Socially, Dan plays stupid.

59
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,600
For me, he looked for how to 
appear funny or entertaining,

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,800
because his image of a big pain in the ass 
was beginning to lose its novelty.

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,100
So he decided to be 
the guy who loses his slibard.

62
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,400
I think this 
is his new ploy.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
But he is the turkey of the farce,

64
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,000
Cause I want you to leave me alone 
long enough

65
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
so I can see your ass 
kicking off on the board.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Survivor - Season 30 Episode 2 
This Will Be My Revenge

67
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,200
Its good. 
Carry on, carry on.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
That's it. 
Now, face blunder.

69
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,700
- And to the hands. 
- You're burning, you're burning!

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,900
We have fire.

71
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,000
It's the 4th day. 
We just started a fire.

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,500
Barely. 
We have trouble, on the camp,

73
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,900
to organize the subsistence minimum.

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Not being textbooks 
sets us apart from the Blues.

75
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,200
I wouldn't be surprised 
if the Blues made fire,

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
kicking in the stretchers 
and wreaking havoc.

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,200
But where we don't have a problem 
is that we have a magnificent beach,

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,700
where you can go swimming.

79
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you mind 
if I go swimming?

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
- Okay with you ? 
- Yeah, no worries.

81
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,700
As a fan who studied 
and taught this game,

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,900
it seems appropriate 
to take my hat off

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,400
to some 
of my illustrious predecessors.

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,400
And There you go. The new Richard Hatch 
model.

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,400
- What is your program today? 
- Don't watch this.

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
I will focus on the fire.

87
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,900
Max is an interesting character.

88
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,900
It has a little colorless side.

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,200
The type to do what he wants, 
to walk around naked.

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,700
It brings a little lightness.

91
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,200
But I don't know 
what the show part is,

92
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,200
and how much 
of an attempt to distract us

93
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,400
his intelligence 
and his knowledge of the game.

94
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,700
Being in Adam's outfit 
is no problem for me.

95
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,500
It's liberating, enjoyable,

96
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,600
and it snaps you out of your wet Survivor outfit for a moment .

97
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,700
It is also ideal 
for having some privacy.

98
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Because surprisingly,

99
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,000
when you tell people 
you are going swimming

100
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,700
and they know you'll be naked,

101
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,400
you have a good chance 
of swimming alone.

102
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,400
So it's a bit strategic, 
just to have some privacy,

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,900
away from the fray. 
A little time to reflect.

104
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,900
Where is Max? In water ?

105
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Yes. I just saw his butt.

106
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,000
Max likes this game as much as me, 
it's an adventure for him,

107
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,500
what makes me love 
him and brings me closer to him.

108
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,400
And he's the type 
to start fashions.

109
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,400
In fact, it's often 
very convenient to be naked.

110
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Hey, she's bare ass!

111
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,900
What, does that surprise you?

112
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,700
Naked dishes?

113
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm sure even 
the Colorless don't do that.

114
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,200
Max and Shirin walk around naked 
all the time.

115
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Poor Tyler is married,

116
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,900
and it's: "Oh no, 
I can't watch!".

117
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,400
- Are you filling the bean pot? 
- I fill it with water and wash it.

118
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,900
So I don't wash this?

119
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,200
Uh... Yeah... 
He's gonna bring...

120
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,700
He's going to bring back a pot.

121
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,200
The main pot takes a long time 
to clean, I'll make those cups.

122
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,400
I have too much pride 
to do that.

123
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,700
At least someone proud 
in this tribe.

124
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,400
Hey, Nina! You have 
a nasty blister on your ankle.

125
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,200
- Sorry ? 
- A blister on the ankle.

126
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,000
Owl.

127
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,200
- A blister. On the ankle. 
- I'm healing.

128
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,400
I try to get to know Nina better, 
to approach her,

129
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
because she's nice.

130
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,400
And with her disability, 
it's amazing that she's here.

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,400
Alas, because she is deaf,

132
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,300
it is very difficult 
to converse with her.

133
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
"Bring !" 
I like !

134
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,200
I like your top.

135
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,400
We could collect 
rainwater that way.

136
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,900
- Sorry ? 
- Collect rainwater.

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,300
Did you see ? Is the crab 
still in there?

138
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,400
- The what ? 
- Here. You see that ?

139
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
- Is the crab still in there? 
- Yeah.

140
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,100
How do people 
converse with her?

141
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,800
A Colorless is a 
good being, who has heart and compassion.

142
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
But the girls 
are very sarcastic.

143
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,800
Nina wants to be part of the tribe, 
to have conversations, to share.

144
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,700
However, 
it is very hard for her.

145
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,200
And I find that girls find it 
difficult to adapt.

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,700
- I want to go swimming naked. 
- Me too. I'm too fed up here.

147
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,800
Let's go!

148
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,600
Ever since I lost my hearing, 
I've been pushed aside.

149
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Because people don't know 
how to do it.

150
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,900
I was hoping 
it would be different here.

151
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,200
The girls of the tribe 
excluded me at all levels.

152
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
From day 1.

153
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
The straw that broke the camel,

154
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,800
it's because they went swimming 
without offering it to me.

155
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,100
They never ask me 
to do anything with them.

156
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,900
I knew from the start 
that it would be tough.

157
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,900
But I thought my teammates

158
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,400
would at least try to 
make me feel included.

159
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,600
It was nice of you 
to invite me.

160
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
You never invite me.

161
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,800
- We told the whole tribe... 
- And you left.

162
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
- Would you have come to swim naked? 
- You know what ?

163
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,800
You two have been ignoring me 
since day one.

164
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,600
You don't participate 
much in conversations either.

165
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,400
You could make an effort. 
But you don't even invite me.

166
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
Earlier, you were offered 
to come swimming, you said no.

167
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,200
You know what, Hali, 
don't touch me!

168
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,900
I really didn't 
think you would be interested.

169
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,300
I'm having so much fun, 
I'm swimming naked with my friend,

170
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,100
I come back and... 
Nina is crying.

171
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,100
She is angry and says we are 
mean for not including her.

172
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,900
I was like, "Are you serious?"

173
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,800
- We made an adult cry. 
- We made an adult cry.

174
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,800
In general, a mother 
does not want to bathe naked.

175
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,100
She wanted to be a young girl.

176
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,900
Pull yourself together, Nina! 
You cry on the 4th day!

177
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,100
I understand that she is used 
to more attention.

178
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,100
But we don't do that in this game. 
You have to have thicker leather.

179
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,500
So we're probably going to have to 
babysit Nina for a bit,

180
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,300
until... 
We don't have to do it anymore.

181
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Not the slightest human compassion!

182
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,100
- You know, they're just young. 
- I know, they are young, I know.

183
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,200
They are immature.

184
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,100
Nina is very nice, 
but it shows that she is lost.

185
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,200
What can I do to help you?

186
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,700
You are already doing everything you need to.

187
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,100
I fully understand his problems. 
I hope she recovers.

188
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,900
But at this point, I think she 
's already stuck a target on her back.

189
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,400
We have to take care of the water. 
Right away.

190
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,400
Without wanting to piss off, 
everyone must move.

191
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,400
As a kid, I learned 
to work hard.

192
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,900
And that's what I do 
in the game.

193
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
But Mike keep 
breaking 'em on me on the camp,

194
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,300
because it always has to be active, 
you can never rest.

195
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,300
What do you want to do ?

196
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,900
Do you basketball?

197
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,300
We work hard, 
but we also have to have fun.

198
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,400
- Dan, can you help me with the rice? 
- Yeah, when she's fired.

199
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,900
I had to work hard 
all my life.

200
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,100
So it's in my nature 
to be a hard worker.

201
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,700
So it's frustrating for me, 
being a real worker,

202
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,300
to see others just...

203
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,100
I want to play basketball too

204
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,700
but there are tricks 
to do for survival.

205
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,800
We shouldn't have to tell 
adults what to do.

206
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,200
Without wanting to piss off: 
go get some wood!

207
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,700
We agree ?

208
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,300
You still have to pick it up.

209
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
What's going on there?

210
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,800
At work !

211
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,900
Mike pisses people off.

212
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,800
We have a pile of wood 1m50 high. 
Why get excited?

213
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,700
I may not bring back the most 
wood, but I don't inflate anyone.

214
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,800
Argue with someone 
and you are sure to be targeted.

215
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,300
The bad news: 
I didn't catch any blue crabs.

216
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,900
The good news: 
we have plenty of other kinds!

217
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,400
- Oh my God ! 
- Gosh !

218
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,200
That's great.

219
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,300
- Can you give me a hand? 
- Light.

220
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,200
What's going on ?

221
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,900
It's painful 
to be around people who...

222
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,700
No matter what job I do, 
it goes unnoticed,

223
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,300
because Joe reaps the laurels. 
"Joe does this, Joe does that."

224
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,300
I probably work 
harder than anyone here.

225
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,300
But on the camp, 
there is only for Joe.

226
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,400
He has this "young braggart" side, 
he wants to prove himself.

227
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,600
I totally understand. 
I was young too.

228
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,900
Now I'm 32, 
my hormones have calmed down,

229
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,300
and I know how to let it go.

230
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,300
But Joe likes to be 
the center of attention.

231
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,300
And it pisses me off.

232
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,600
I need recognition 
and assurance.

233
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
If I do something

234
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,400
If I give you a piece of advice, 
it doesn't often go well.

235
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Generally, yes.

236
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,200
For me, everything is fine.

237
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,200
OK. I know you get excited fast 
and want to act,

238
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,200
but it's like shelter. 
I felt a lot of ego.

239
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,200
You wanted to do it your way.

240
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,800
I just think my way 
of doing things is more efficient.

241
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,800
- It's the right way for me. 
- But not for me.

242
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,400
From the start, Joe and Vince have been 
battling for power.

243
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,200
Both want to be the alpha male. 
And it makes other people uncomfortable.

244
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,800
Recognize that 
you take over the projects.

245
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,100
For shelter, I was... 
Yeah.

246
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,800
Of course, I sometimes 
objected to your idea.

247
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,300
Vince took me aside 
and said,

248
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,300
"Admit that 
you do this and that."

249
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,400
Frankly, 
I didn't know what to say.

250
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I think he has some issues 
that he has to deal with on his own.

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,800
He wants to be the provider.

252
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
He wants to make the decisions. 
It's in his personality.

253
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,800
But he's out of control, 
and I don't like that.

254
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,400
We're moving forward, 
we're over this bullshit?

255
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,900
- Yeah, no, seriously. 
- I want this to work, really.

256
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,400
Yes. Yes.

257
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,900
Joe said it all, 
and I want to believe him.

258
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,400
But there. In my life 
I am surrounded by people

259
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
that I can take for a 
long time in my arms,

260
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,800
ten seconds of beauty, 
bliss, peace.

261
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,300
But with Joe, 
I don't feel that.

262
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,000
- I don't trust those three. 
- Me neither, not at all.

263
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,600
Vince, I'm all for 
Will and you.

264
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,300
Good.

265
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,300
They have preconceptions about me, 
just because of that.

266
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,800
It is unfair.

267
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,100
So my loyalty is to you.

268
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Did things really 
improve between you and Vince?

269
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,400
I doubt he trusts me.

270
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
His eyes penetrate you 
to look into your soul,

271
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
to see if you're lying.

272
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,100
That's how I feel 
when he talks to me. Like, stop!

273
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,100
Because he speaks to you very close.

274
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Vince kinda freaks me out 
with his "in-your-face" bullshit.

275
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,800
I don't doubt for a moment 
that he will do something totally crazy

276
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,100
which will put the whole tribe 
in trouble.

277
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,100
He's just super paranoid.

278
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,600
He is intuitive. Probably a lot 
smarter than you think.

279
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,100
I think Vince is dangerous. 
He is on another planet.

280
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,600
He's just a little too 
"Colorless" for his own interest.

281
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,100
Overalls, Colorless, 
discover the new White Collar tribe.

282
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,100
So was eliminated 
at the first council.

283
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,600
- Ready for the immunity test? 
- Yes !

284
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,100
First, 
I collect the idols.

285
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
- You'll have to take it from me. 
- Wow, really?

286
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,200
Dan doesn't move an inch.

287
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,100
Give it too. Thanks.

288
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

289
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,300
For today's test,

290
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,300
one after another you will dive 
and swim to a platform,

291
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,300
where you will find buoys 
attached to a rope.

292
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,300
You'll maneuver 
them through a series of obstacles

293
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,100
and swim to the platform. 
Then it's on to the next.

294
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,800
Once 
the five buoys have been collected,

295
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,600
you will throw them in a basket.

296
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,600
The first tribe to place 
their five buoys in the basket

297
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,600
gains immunity and reward. 
Want to know what's at stake?

298
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,800
In addition to not going to the council...

299
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,600
For the first tribe, 
a large fishing kit.

300
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,600
Everything you need to 
catch fish is here.

301
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,100
For the second tribe, 
smaller but still effective...

302
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
A line, bait and a harpoon.

303
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,300
It will definitely change your life.

304
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Overalls, Without Color, 
you have to do without a person.

305
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,600
- I want to do it. 
- OK.

306
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Really ? Kelly?

307
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,800
I'll surprise you 
for a big one, don't worry.

308
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,600
Kelly does not participate 
in the Bleus de Travail.

309
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,400
Without Color, who does not participate?

310
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,300
Nina does not participate.

311
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
One minute to get organized 
and we'll get started.

312
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,600
Let's go ! 
For reward and immunity!

313
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Survivors, ready?

314
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,100
It's Vince for Colorless, 
Dan for Overalls

315
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,100
and Tyler for White Collar. 
Dan said:

316
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,800
"You will underestimate me, 
I will show you!".

317
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,100
Let's see how he does.

318
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Vince goes up. Dan goes up. 
Tyler goes up.

319
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,400
Vince is the first in the water, 
followed by Dan for the Blues!

320
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
Good job !

321
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,600
Tyler is now in the water 
for White.

322
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,300
Vince approaches the second obstacle. 
This is Dan and Tyler.

323
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,800
There are five buoys in all.

324
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,800
It's very hard. Sounds simple, 
but you have to go down and up.

325
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,600
Nice work by Vince 
for the Colorless.

326
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,800
He increases his lead.

327
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Dan, second for the Blues. 
Tyler, third for the Whites.

328
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,100
We have to get out of the water!

329
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,100
Vince is stuck!

330
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Dan catches up with Vince, who is in trouble.

331
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Go, Blues!

332
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,300
Vince comes out of the water. 
He wasted a lot of time.

333
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,100
Go, Colorless!

334
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,300
Tyler has arrived. 
Go, White Collars!

335
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Well done from Dan, 
catching Vince.

336
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,600
It's still very tight.

337
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,600
The Blues are leading. 
The Colorless are just behind.

338
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Carolyn gives her all 
for the White Collars.

339
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,300
Carolyn moved 
to White Collar.

340
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,800
Hali does not waste a second.

341
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Sierra remains very calm 
for the Blues.

342
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,800
Carolyn tries 
to make up time.

343
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,300
The Colorless take the lead.

344
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,800
Here is Sierra for the Blues.

345
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,100
Hali is out. Type!

346
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Tap, Hali! 
Go, Colorless!

347
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,600
Dan helps Sierra. 
Go, work blues!

348
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,100
Go, White Collars!

349
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,800
Jenn flies over this course.

350
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,300
It increases 
the lead of the Colorless.

351
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,100
Mike has regained a lot of time 
for the Labor Blues.

352
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Here it is in the water.

353
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,800
Max tries to come back up 
for the White Collars.

354
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,100
It's between Jenn and Mike.

355
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,600
Without Color against Work Blues, 
as in the 1st event.

356
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,300
Max is in the water with 
the third Cols Blancs buoy.

357
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,100
Jenn arrives with 
the third Colorless Buoy.

358
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,100
- Go on ! 
- Let's go !

359
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,100
Jennifer has arrived. Vince helps her. 
Hit the post, Jenn!

360
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Go, Colorless! 
Will is in the water.

361
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,800
Tap, Mike! 
Go, work blues!

362
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Lindsey is in the water for the Blues. 
Go on, Max, come on!

363
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,600
Go, White Collars! 
Shirin is in the water.

364
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Will crosses the barrier 
for the Colorless.

365
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Lindsey is in the water 
for the Work Blues.

366
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,300
Shirin has some catching up 
to do for the White Collars.

367
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,300
It's between Will and Lindsey.

368
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Overalls and Colorless, 
always shoulder to shoulder.

369
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,100
Shirin is in the water for White. 
Can she make up time?

370
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,600
Will slows down 
on this second obstacle.

371
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,800
Lindsey takes the lead 
for the Labor Blues.

372
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,800
Shirin regains time. 
She catches up with Will!

373
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,300
Lindsey has the fourth. 
Type!

374
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,100
Go, work blues! 
Rodney is in the water.

375
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,300
Will, still stuck in the water.

376
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,100
Shirin passed Will.

377
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,300
Will is all tangled up.

378
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,300
The White Collars, now 2nd. 
Go, White Collars!

379
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Joaquin is in the water 
for the fifth and final buoy.

380
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,600
Rodney is in the water for the Blues. 
He's making progress.

381
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,300
Joaquin is progressing for the Whites.

382
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Look at this !

383
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,600
It's between Rodney and Joaquin! 
For Will, it's an absolute disaster.

384
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
It's good, we can come back! 
Everything is possible !

385
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,100
Will finally released his buoy. 
Joaquin has now passed Rodney.

386
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,100
The Whites are going to finish first, 
although they were dead last!

387
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,300
Go, Colorless! 
Joe is finally in the water.

388
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,300
Joaquin has arrived. 
Start untying your rope!

389
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,100
Look Joe! He flies over the course 
and tries to make up time.

390
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,100
Joaquin is already shooting.

391
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Joaquin scores for the Whites. 
Rodney has arrived for the Blues.

392
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,100
Joe overcame the obstacle.

393
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
Sierra shoots for the Blues.

394
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,800
Joe left last, 
but he's not giving up.

395
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,800
The Colorless 
are staying in the game.

396
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,600
White scores 
a second point!

397
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,100
The Colorless prepare 
to shoot. Joe has arrived!

398
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
Come on, Colorless! 
You are always in the game!

399
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,800
The Blues score. 1 to 2 !

400
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,300
Joe shoots for the Colorless, 
Joaquin for the Whites.

401
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,100
White scores again! 
Three for the Whites!

402
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
The Whites are unleashed!

403
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,300
4th point from Joaquin for the Whites! 
Two for Sierra!

404
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,900
Always zero for Colorless. 
Far too short. Vince tries. Missed.

405
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,300
Joaquin could win...

406
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Oh, it comes out!

407
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,800
Sierra... 
And three for the Blues!

408
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,600
The Colorless do not manage 
to place the slightest buoy.

409
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
The Whites, 
who were dead last...

410
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,100
Joaquin wins for the Whites! 
There is one spot left!

411
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,600
It's between the Overalls 
and the Colorless.

412
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Four for the Blues of Work.

413
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,300
The Colorless 
begin to panic.

414
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
They don't get anywhere.

415
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,600
Sierra could win...

416
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
It is done !

417
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,800
The Blues of Work 
gain immunity and reward,

418
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,800
sending the Colorless 
to the council!

419
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,300
White collar, congratulations.

420
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,200
Work blues, 
still no advice for you.

421
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,100
- I will take it. 
- This time, you take it.

422
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,800
The Blues, the Whites, enjoy 
the evening and the fishing equipment.

423
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,300
Return to camp.

424
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,200
The Colorless, 
it was not in your plans,

425
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,300
but see you tonight at the council,

426
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
where someone will be the second 
person eliminated from the game.

427
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,800
Return to the camp. 
We'll see you at the council.

428
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,600
Tonight, someone is going to leave.

429
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:19,300
And when it comes to Joe and me, 
it's the Cold War, missiles pointed.

430
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,800
We are ready to shoot. 
It's gonna get crazy.

431
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,700
- I can't believe we lost. 
- I say !

432
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,700
We didn't put a single bullet.

433
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Sorry for not being able to conclude.

434
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,500
Not serious. It's not your fault.

435
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,300
It was group work, group 
failure, whatever.

436
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,800
It sucks. 
One of us has to go.

437
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,300
We screwed up the test, 
and now we're going to the council.

438
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,600
It will be very interesting,

439
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,500
because this is the time when we have to 
make decisions.

440
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,500
And being the Colorless, 
that's not one of our strengths.

441
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,800
How is it going ? 
You're okay ?

442
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,300
What's wrong ? 
All ?

443
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,000
- Are you depressed? 
- Just exhausted, that's all.

444
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
- Will is degrading. 
- He is tired.

445
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,500
- He hardly slept all night. 
- And me only two hours.

446
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,500
- Is it his asthma...? 
- He has poor health.

447
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
Yeah.

448
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,000
We all feel the lack 
of sleep and food.

449
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,000
But Will's exhaustion 
showed during the ordeal.

450
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
And that worries me.

451
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,800
But it remains an opportunity to eliminate 
a strong player by surprise: Joe.

452
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
It's our only chance to get Joe out.

453
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,800
But if we do that, I don't know 
if we'll win any events.

454
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I know Will's not well, 
but if we change our plans,

455
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,500
we will leave all three.

456
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,800
Vince, Will and I 
need to stick together.

457
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,800
Otherwise we'll all leave, 
and I could be the first.

458
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,800
Because after my scandal, 
I know they want me gone.

459
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,300
So I'm very nervous.

460
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
We might be able to 
win a few trials.

461
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,300
Depends on whether Will 
can recover.

462
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,300
- Let me test the waters with him. 
- Yes please.

463
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,000
How do you see all this?

464
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Without canard. 
What would you like to happen?

465
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
I do not know.

466
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,000
How about we take Vince out?

467
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,000
Cut off the head of the snake, 
and let it break from this game.

468
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,800
I don't trust him at all.

469
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:57,000
I would like to fire Vince, 
but I have concerns about Nina.

470
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,000
In his place, I would seek 
the idol through thick and thin.

471
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,000
So, her first 
or Vincent first?

472
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
The game has just started.

473
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,300
Let's keep the team strong, 
let's take it down.

474
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
At this point, it's a shame, 
but Nina is the weak link.

475
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,500
She's 54, 
and her hearing isn't helping.

476
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
She knows she is in the worst position. 
She's probably looking for the idol.

477
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,000
We need to pay attention.

478
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,000
What if we did that? 
How about dividing the votes?

479
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
You two vote for Vince,

480
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,500
- and you and me... 
- You vote for Nina?

481
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If she doesn't play it, 
we'll vote again, and she leaves.

482
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,500
I'm allied with the girls 
and Will is the fourth.

483
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,800
I hope 
he is honest with me.

484
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I have my doubts because he spent a 
lot of time with Nina.

485
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,900
But you have 
to trust in this game,

486
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,300
so let's hope 
Will is with me,

487
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,300
because otherwise, it will confuse 
a lot of plans.

488
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,300
Everything rests on you.

489
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Joe wants me to eliminate Nina 
with the girls and him.

490
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,300
I do not want to do it. 
We have a lot in common.

491
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,300
She thinks she's left out 
because of her deafness.

492
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,800
I know how she feels, 
being the only black guy in the game.

493
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But since we know 
they're going to split their votes,

494
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,500
if Vince, Nina and I eliminate 
one of them, we control the tribe.

495
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,300
Listen a little. 
They want to split the votes.

496
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,800
You, Nina and I can 
take out Joe or one of the girls.

497
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,300
Will told me that these three are 
trying to split the votes.

498
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,300
This is huge, because now 
is the perfect time to take action.

499
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,500
In my heart, in my gut, 
I want to get rid of Joe.

500
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,400
He is very, very dangerous.

501
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,500
But Joe is really strong 
in trials.

502
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:57,000
This is a considerable asset. 
Am I ready to do without?

503
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,500
You want Joe gone, huh?

504
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,100
The thing is, 
I have zero trust in Jenn.

505
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,000
She wants you gone, that's for sure.

506
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,300
She's mean to Nina. 
Let her go!

507
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,000
- Besides, if we take Jenn out... 
- We keep control.

508
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,800
Yes, and we keep a strong player 
who will not want to leave.

509
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,800
And we can win races.

510
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,500
- If I get tricked... 
- You don't... I'm telling you no.

511
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,300
Trust me. We have the votes.

512
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,800
I spoke with Vince. 
He wants Jenn gone.

513
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,000
- So you and I are voting Jenn. 
- Seriously ? Really ?

514
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,800
- And then we control the votes. 
- This will be my revenge.

515
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,300
- But Will, how are you feeling? 
- Every defeat depresses me.

516
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,000
Not that. Your health.

517
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,800
- How is your health ? 
- Everything is fine.

518
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,500
- Everything is fine ? 
- Yeah.

519
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,500
Want to change your vote?

520
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,500
Vince is concerned that your health 
will harm us in trials.

521
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Because of a test?

522
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I carded in the first. 
He screwed up in both.

523
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,500
Apparently Vince is telling 
the others that I'm not well,

524
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,300
because of my performance 
in today's event.

525
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,000
That's bullshit !

526
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,600
That I get stuck 
didn't cost us the ordeal.

527
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,300
Not scoring a point 
cost us the event.

528
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
It annoys me.

529
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,000
- If he's trying to get me... 
- He's not trying to take you out.

530
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,000
I do not know. 
If he wants me gone, that changes everything.

531
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,500
At this point there's so much 
conspiracy and intrigue

532
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't know who to believe anymore.

533
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,800
These three are close. 
Joe probably only came to see me

534
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,500
only because they need 
my vote. But at the same time,

535
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,500
can I really 
trust Vince?

536
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,300
I am both 
terrified and excited.

537
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I am the decisive vote, 
I decide who will leave.

538
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:05,100
God knows what will happen. 
But it won't be sad.

539
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,000
Behind you, torches.

540
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,100
Grab one 
and light it in the fire.

541
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,500
It is part 
of the council ritual,

542
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,900
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

543
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,700
If your fire goes away, so do you.

544
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,600
OK, colorless. 
Let's talk about group dynamics.

545
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,100
Nina, what divisions do you see?

546
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,600
People who 
agree or disagree.

547
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,700
In the beginning, I saw Hali and Jenn 
often together,

548
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,600
then I saw Joe join this duo,

549
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,900
and Will and I hang out together 
because we have a lot in common.

550
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,700
But it's hard to be the oldest.

551
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,500
Young people often leave me out.

552
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,200
But that's part of the game.

553
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,400
The social interactions 
of people from different backgrounds.

554
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,900
It's hard for me, because I ca 
n't always hear the conversations

555
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,900
and everything that happens,

556
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,600
and I don't want to be 
the pest who says:

557
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,200
"What? What are you saying? Huh?".

558
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,100
I had a little bout of depression 
from feeling so alone.

559
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Jenn, on the one hand, you could say:

560
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,400
"We have to help Nina, she does 
n't hear like us, let's make an effort.".

561
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,700
On the other, we could say: 
"We all have our problems".

562
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,400
What is your point of view ?

563
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,400
I had never dated 
someone who is hard of hearing.

564
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,100
So I sympathize.

565
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,400
But it's a game. 
And people go along with it.

566
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,000
Vince, if there's a threesome 
based on age and interests,

567
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,000
and another of two 
on the same logic,

568
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,600
where are you ?

569
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,000
Right in the middle, I guess.

570
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,400
I like cohesion. That's my nature.

571
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,200
I try to be the cement 
that holds it all together.

572
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,700
Joe, if Vince is in the middle, 
a most interesting situation,

573
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,400
because if he thinks: "These three are too 
close, I don't want to be number 4.",

574
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,700
he goes with Nina and Will,

575
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,400
and then we have a 
power struggle in this tribe.

576
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,100
Oh yeah, absolutely.

577
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,100
We assessed each other, and he'll 
probably land where he belongs.

578
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,200
I think tonight, 
the person who has to leave, will leave.

579
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,600
Jenn, is it correct to assume 
that Joe, Hali and you are together?

580
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,900
Based on what I heard?

581
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,400
Sure.

582
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,400
It would be silly to say: "Oh no, 
they argue sometimes, that's all!".

583
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
No one in this game is stupid.

584
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,400
I do not think so.

585
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,600
But we have to maintain the workforce. 
You can't lose all the time.

586
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,400
And clearly, some people 
are less good in the tests.

587
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
This is a major concern, 
as the tribe needs to stay strong.

588
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,400
Will, Jenn says some 
are not good at trials.

589
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Your ears must be ringing a little 
after today.

590
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Oh yeah !

591
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,400
Water is Black's kryptonite. 
She got me today.

592
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,400
I got tangled up with this buoy.

593
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,400
Did you say to yourself, at one point, 
"I have to go see Nina and Vince,

594
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,100
to form a trio."

595
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,700
Yes, we talked about it.

596
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,900
We form a trio, they are a trio,

597
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,900
we get a tie and advise.

598
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,200
But we don't know who 
to trust. Yet it must.

599
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,400
If you choose wrongly, 
your flame goes out.

600
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,500
Vince, watching 
from home is one thing,

601
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,900
it's quite another to be here, 
right in the middle of it, as the vote approaches,

602
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,500
without knowing if it is you!

603
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,900
It could totally be.

604
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,600
How do you handle 
all levels of thinking

605
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,200
necessary to 
stay in this game?

606
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,100
Jeff, for the past six days,

607
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,000
I tried to follow 
my gut more than my head.

608
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,200
I was able to chat 
with a few people,

609
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,900
and if I had doubts 
about them before, I no longer have too many.

610
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,000
Jenn, what would you like to 
see happen tonight?

611
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,600
I would like to see 
our original plan apply.

612
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,500
I would like that. 
But I could be in danger.

613
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,400
I do not know.

614
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,200
Nothing worse than feeling 
safe in this game.

615
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
You raise a point.

616
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,100
Even if you three seem close 
and have a grip on events,

617
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,700
you're right, 
it could be you.

618
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,700
It could. But it's cool 
to be here. That's the advice!

619
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,500
I've been watching this 
since I was eight.

620
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,900
I always feel like I'm 
watching you on TV.

621
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,900
I can't believe 
I'm here, I'm losing my mind.

622
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,700
You have no idea.

623
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,400
Will, if you win your case, 
what will happen tonight?

624
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,400
If I win, I'll join 
the tribe, drink lukewarm water,

625
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,400
the insects will 
still feast on this chocolate,

626
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,600
and I will see you less. 
I don't want to see you again until the end.

627
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,900
Looks like it's going to be 
a very important vote,

628
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,400
very early in the game.

629
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,100
It's time to vote. 
Nina, over to you.

630
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,100
It's nothing personal. 
It's strictly strategic.

631
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Nina, you're just not 
the strongest in the tribe.

632
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,100
I will count the votes.

633
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,000
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

634
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,700
now is the time to do it.

635
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,900
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

636
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,000
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

637
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,600
I will read the votes.

638
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:48,900
Jenn.

639
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Two Jenn votes, 
one Vince vote, one Nina vote.

640
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,100
Two Jenn votes, two Vince votes, 
one Nina vote. One vote remains.

641
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,900
Second person eliminated

642
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,600
White Collars vs Overalls 
vs Colorless...

643
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,700
Vince.

644
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,600
Bring me your torch.

645
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,900
Did you vote for Vince?

646
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,600
Vince, the tribe has spoken.

647
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,900
- It's time to go. 
- Good game.

648
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,600
First vote, 
first surprise elimination.

649
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,900
Not bad. But this game 
has only just begun.

650
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,700
Take your things, 
return to camp.

651
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
Good night.

652
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,800
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

653
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,000
Next time in Survivor...

654
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,800
Want to go surfing today?

655
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,800
The paradise of a tribe...

656
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,300
Hali and I were watching those waves. 
Why not enjoy it ?

657
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,000
...is another man's nightmare.

658
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,600
I see something needs to be done 
and I do it.

659
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,800
Let me eat 
and I'll come help you!

660
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,500
Every time we found 
wood, we were there! Every time !

661
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,900
Holy players! 
They did a good job.

662
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,300
Because I would have taken them all out.

663
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,000
It is one of the greatest 
experiences of my life.

664
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,100
I like to explore 
every element of my being,

665
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,200
aspects that would otherwise remain 
unspoken or unexplored,

666
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,600
at every opportunity.

667
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And that was fantastic!
