00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:04,761
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:06,609
After the merger...

4
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:08,358
Congratulations, everyone!

5
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:11,890
...Intelligence and Muscles 
tried to charm Beauty.

6
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:13,688
It's great to have options.

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,619
Debbie wasted no time...

8
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:17,056
I want us to ally.

9
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:19,361
...aggressively trying 
to secure a majority.

10
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,487
Bargain.

11
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:23,290
I seem to be one of the few here 
to play attack.

12
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:24,958
But it backfired on her.

13
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,584
So, Nick, are you with us?

14
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,938
Debbie nearly takes over 
Intelligence's strategy.

15
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,688
She got Intelligence on her back...

16
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:33,700
Everyone's sick of Debbie.

17
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,268
Because of that, we're screwed.

18
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,165
...facilitating 
Beauty's decision...

19
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,013
- We're going with Muscles. 
- OK.

20
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,750
...to unite with Muscles.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,710
- There are so many of us! 
- 7 against 4.

22
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,115
We stuff the nerds 
in the lockers.

23
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,957
For Intelligence, 
everything went from bad to worse...

24
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,594
...when Neal 
fell victim to the elements.

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,397
- You pull Neal out of the game. 
- I think I have to.

26
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:56,956
My poor.

27
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:58,917
My number 1 ally! Left !

28
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,193
And the idol with him.

29
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:01,670
The bastard!

30
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,130
Once again, the game has changed.

31
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:06,042
There are ten left.

32
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,009
Who will be eliminated tonight?

33
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:16,218
Previously on Survivor...

34
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:19,818
You can very well be happy 
and sad at the same time!

35
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:23,458
- In the meantime, we're still here! 
- We are here !

36
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,028
It makes me want 
to clean my cuts thoroughly.

37
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:32,367
Today, Neal gone, 
I don't feel in a strong position.

38
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:35,566
His departure blows our calculations.

39
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,691
The Intelligences are three,

40
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:40,288
Debbie, Aubry and myself.

41
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:42,640
I do not know what to say anymore.

42
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,919
Survivor 
is like a box of chocolates.

43
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:48,982
You never know 
what you're going to stumble upon.

44
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,130
We are at the bottom of the totem

45
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:53,580
and things are fluctuating.

46
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:57,686
I want to see if there are other options, 
that's the main thing now.

47
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:59,664
I have to make 
my neurons work.

48
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,631
As long as there is life, 
there is hope.

49
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,734
We'll decide 
who goes first and...

50
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,003
We stick to the plan.

51
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,562
It doesn't matter now.

52
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,841
We're pretty tight, 
Beauty and Muscles.

53
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,911
It is more or less established 
that the Intelligences will leave.

54
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:19,194
As far as I know, 
Neal left with an idol.

55
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,107
But if he left her in the game,

56
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:24,753
the plan now is 
to split the votes each time,

57
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,401
so that if there is an idol, 
it is played without harming us.

58
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:30,058
Because we are 7 against 3.

59
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,058
Beauty votes for Debbie 
until she comes out.

60
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:35,482
Muscles votes for Aubry.

61
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:39,046
- An objection? 
- Nope.

62
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,128
Quiet, we do our thing.

63
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,857
Aubry returns.

64
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:53,043
I feel what is happening.

65
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:55,150
It's like in high school.

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,687
Our camp is divided

67
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,266
by the tough.

68
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:03,148
Around them are the girls,

69
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:06,886
those who are pretty 
and get along with these people.

70
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:11,605
And the shyest, the intellectuals, 
are on the sidelines.

71
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,080
They are all happy with his departure.

72
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,250
But sportsmen and cannons 
will not cannonate forever.

73
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,923
They age and decay. 
And they will disappear.

74
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:25,438
In the end, 
the marginalized will have their revenge.

75
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,014
If I find a flaw 
or play the troublemaker,

76
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,846
I may find an opening.

77
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,845
Do you let your daughter do your 
hair sometimes?

78
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,655
- All the time. 
- All the time.

79
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,457
She does my makeup "when I sleep".

80
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:18,967
She is awesome.

81
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,391
Chloe is...

82
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:22,499
She is Chloe.

83
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:26,046
Some of you already know it, might 
as well say it, she is autistic.

84
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,933
His case is quite severe.

85
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:32,414
She goes to kindergarten. 
We take care of her.

86
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,784
We go to therapy 
three mornings a week.

87
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,009
We go to therapy after school.

88
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,836
Occupational therapy, 
speech therapy, physiotherapy...

89
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:43,104
Basically,

90
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,031
I didn't want to use my daughter 
to advance in the game.

91
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,606
But if I'm asked 
about my children,

92
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,690
I tell the truth.

93
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:53,702
Cause I didn't really know

94
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:55,528
what autism was.

95
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:59,541
Until we figured it out 
and my daughter was diagnosed.

96
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:03,019
Basically, 
every penny that I earn

97
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:05,767
is used to pay the hospital, the doctors.

98
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:07,823
Because of this, we are very poor,

99
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:10,891
but happy, 
because we see his big progress.

100
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,712
At least,

101
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:15,790
people will realize 
that there are families

102
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,618
with autistic children.

103
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:19,235
And it is very expensive.

104
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,124
And it's much more common 
than you think.

105
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:26,477
It wasn't supposed to serve me.

106
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:28,573
But I believe they realized

107
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:31,573
that I'm not just 
this big deviant and dominant,

108
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,208
but that I am also human.

109
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,697
But she is perfect.

110
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:38,171
That's how it's supposed to be, 
I'm not complaining.

111
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,774
I just wish I 
could help her more.

112
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:44,920
Jason took a great opportunity 
to talk about his life.

113
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,062
He is rather seen as a strong man,

114
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:49,987
hot-tempered and loud-mouthed.

115
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:51,979
At this point, 
I saw all its facets.

116
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:54,468
It was nice, but at the same time,

117
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:57,968
it shows 
that he might be hard to beat,

118
00:05:58,093 --> 00:05:59,392
now towards the end.

119
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:02,028
I 
would give him money too!

120
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,772
It's a beautiful thing.

121
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:07,013
At this point, it's my own game 
that I have to determine.

122
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:10,070
Who do I trust? Who to go with? 
Who will take me further?

123
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:13,148
I have to take a step back. 
Who could you beat?

124
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,723
There is the question.

125
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,196
Over here, everyone!

126
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,962
Ready for 
today's reward event?

127
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,372
- Yes ! 
- Yeah !

128
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,500
Today you will be divided 
into two teams of five.

129
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,644
At my signal, you will rush

130
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,033
and use poles 
to pass a team member

131
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,984
from one large platform to another.

132
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,220
Then you will all swim 
towards a very narrow tower.

133
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,165
The first full team on 
top of this tower,

134
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,694
with the feet on 
or above the top,

135
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:01,328
win the reward.

136
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,698
- Do you want to know what's at stake? 
- Yeah.

137
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:05,895
Ice cream.

138
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,844
I'll whet your appetite.

139
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,078
Inspire your motivation.

140
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,167
It's too good.

141
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,271
I let you share.

142
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,414
A bowl.

143
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,849
Oh, a bowl, yeah!

144
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:22,276
It's nice !

145
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,912
Ice cream 
will be delivered to you at the camp

146
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,415
and you will feast 
until satiety.

147
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,019
Oh no !

148
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:33,972
We form the teams 
like a schoolyard.

149
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:36,122
We draw the captains 
and we start.

150
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,963
Good,

151
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,136
we have two 
very different teams.

152
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,688
Julia was captain.

153
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:50,437
She chose the two larger ones 
and the two smaller ones.

154
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:54,182
Nick, Debbie, Scot et Tai.

155
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,911
Aubry was captain.

156
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:58,920
His choices were more homogeneous,

157
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,470
with Cydney, Michele, Joe and Jason.

158
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,352
It's time to find out 
who made the best choice.

159
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,219
Let's go. For the reward,

160
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:08,730
Survivors, ready?

161
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,961
You have to transfer someone

162
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,603
using these poles.

163
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:20,508
Only one person 
must therefore climb on this platform.

164
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,476
It will be Julia and Aubry.

165
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:26,147
The two captains will also be 
the people transported.

166
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,683
This is where teamwork 
will make the difference.

167
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,544
- Closer. 
- Go ahead !

168
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,330
Stay fixed. Good.

169
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:35,956
Aubry passes on the 2nd pole.

170
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,910
Julia tries to reach the 2nd.

171
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:45,089
Aubry falls, she will try again.

172
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:47,733
There is clearly 
a learning phase.

173
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,562
A little bit closer. Sorry.

174
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,673
Aubry tries again.

175
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,766
Aubry falters.

176
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,614
Aubry falls again.

177
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:03,906
Julia progresses on the course.

178
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,721
When we've taken the hit, 
we go faster,

179
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,246
so persevere!

180
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,259
Aubry tries again.

181
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,059
She seems much more stable 
this time.

182
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,822
It's good, it's good.

183
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:18,426
Aubry falls again.

184
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:21,204
This is where we see the advantage,

185
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,405
for Julia's team,

186
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,765
of the great strength of Scot and Nick.

187
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,876
This same force, and this size,

188
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,378
will be obstacles in the end.

189
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,031
For the Blues, Aubry tries again.

190
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,184
Aubry falls again.

191
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,642
I'm going to try.

192
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,187
They exchange.

193
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,747
Michele is going to give it a shot.

194
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,691
Julia really took the hit.

195
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:43,817
Nice balance

196
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,251
and great teamwork

197
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,488
of Nick, Tai, Scot and Debbie.

198
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:49,055
- Its good ? 
- I've got you.

199
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,736
Julia is halfway there. 
Michele is going to give it a shot.

200
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,735
You just need a bit of rhythm!

201
00:09:56,681 --> 00:10:00,242
Michele, undeterred, 
tries to pick up the pace.

202
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,711
Joe and Cydney 
try to hold her down.

203
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,009
Jason and Aubry bypass her.

204
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:06,139
Closer !

205
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:11,519
Another step for Michele.

206
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,854
She does not hold.

207
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,522
She has to start over.

208
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,484
- Wait, wait. 
- Julia approaches the platform.

209
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:21,196
Fall now 
and you'll have to start from the beginning!

210
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,822
No precipitation.

211
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,902
Julia is in trouble 
for the first time.

212
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,230
Julia struggles to maintain herself, 
but she succeeds.

213
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,740
Nice recovery!

214
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:35,685
Michele falls again.

215
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:37,871
Cydney will give it a shot.

216
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,046
Its good ?

217
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,316
Your stability 
depends on that of the poles.

218
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,920
Julia, again 
a stone's throw from falling.

219
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,552
Julia, not close enough to jump, 
she still needs one.

220
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,816
- Its good ? 
- Yes !

221
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:58,758
That will be enough!

222
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:01,469
Julia has passed! 
Everyone get on the platform!

223
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,141
My legs are shaking!

224
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,331
Go for it !

225
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:07,567
They are Julia,

226
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:09,836
Debbie, Nick, Tai et Scot.

227
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,172
They have completed the first stage,

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,750
while Cydney falls headfirst 
.

229
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,962
They just have to hold 
on top of a very narrow tower.

230
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:23,752
Scot's feet 
are bigger than the base!

231
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:27,153
That is to say 
if it will be difficult for them.

232
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:29,375
Michelle is back.

233
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:31,600
And back in the water.

234
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:34,877
Tai is the last.

235
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:37,639
You just have to get up 
and stand on your feet.

236
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,309
A real correction 
is taking shape!

237
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:43,937
Absolute disaster for the Blues!

238
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:45,946
Here we are !

239
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:49,618
Three, two, one...

240
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:50,869
That's it !

241
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:56,623
Reward for Scot, 
Nick, Debbie, Julia and Tai!

242
00:11:57,642 --> 00:11:59,052
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:03,431
Julia, you clearly 
made the right choices.

244
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:05,458
Ice cream will be delivered

245
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,427
on your camp, for your pleasure.

246
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:11,413
Grab your things, swim back 
and wait for the reward!

247
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,069
When we say that in Survivor,

248
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,738
a bad choice snowballs,

249
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,007
shit, I feel the avalanche, there!

250
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,730
I can't 
get my head above water.

251
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:26,857
First Neal left the game, 
then I picked the team,

252
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:29,224
and apparently 
it was a mess.

253
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,195
It sucks. 
I wanted so much more than that!

254
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,695
And I'm not giving up.

255
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,999
I just feel 
like I'm making bad decisions.

256
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:58,044
Ice cream !

257
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:00,814
Back on the camp,

258
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:02,424
after the test,

259
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,233
the five winners

260
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:06,353
were able to go see 
the ice cream vendor.

261
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:09,164
can i have a chocolate ball

262
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,590
and one of coffee?

263
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:12,133
Mmm, cherries!

264
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,538
And whipped cream.

265
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:18,365
I wish we could share.

266
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,820
But we can not.

267
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:22,504
The other five 
had to land in purgatory

268
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,792
and listen to us 
eat ice cream,

269
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,239
five, six meters away.

270
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:27,574
Trim !

271
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,509
I mix ice and soda.

272
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:33,649
And make me a big 
chocolate waffle cone!

273
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,416
The ice cream 
was a wonderful treat.

274
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,260
It was fantastic

275
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,464
to have a moment of satiety,

276
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:46,034
to know that you are full of glucose 
for the next day,

277
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,461
and I was not at all sorry 
for the losers!

278
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:53,504
It's a little strange sitting here, 
but we make a nice community.

279
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:57,343
You can make noise, do 
n't worry! You have won.

280
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,366
No need to be so quiet.

281
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:06,421
Jason thinks he's in charge 
of a lot of things here.

282
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,576
He is very sure of himself.

283
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:09,891
He screams :

284
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,453
"You can make more noise 
if you want!"

285
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:15,388
And honestly, I respected 
their way of doing things.

286
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:20,794
So long without talking 
to my parents is a record.

287
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,155
I need to call my relatives 
once a week.

288
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,399
How about you, Scott? Where does your mother live?

289
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:29,336
My mom is in Utah, 
in a nursing home.

290
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:31,379
She has health problems.

291
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,341
She is only 75 years old. 
She has a rare disease.

292
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:38,220
Basically, it's the reverse 
of Charcot's disease.

293
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,835
Is your father alive?

294
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,123
He died when I was 16.

295
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:43,592
Are you a believer?

296
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:48,779
I haven't been to church 
since childhood, 17, 18.

297
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:52,000
My universe is my family.

298
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,417
And that is the basis 
of the Mormon religion.

299
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:55,595
It's amazing.

300
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,092
It was one of the advantages,

301
00:14:57,217 --> 00:14:59,256
that's why 
I watch over my family.

302
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,358
We were all poor.

303
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,767
My brother chose 
religion and family

304
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:06,848
and I chose the NBA.

305
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,802
They're struggling, 
financially, so...

306
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,464
And would you like to help them 
even more?

307
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:13,039
That's why I'm here.

308
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,408
- That's what I do. 
- It's very noble.

309
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,784
We were a somewhat random group,

310
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:20,161
so we didn't really 
talk about strategy.

311
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,160
But it was a perfect opportunity 
to bond.

312
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:27,441
And I think Scot and I 
could make a good team.

313
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,195
I love having him on my team.

314
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,363
It is awesome.

315
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:51,892
Everything is fine.

316
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,362
We left ! We left !

317
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,923
- Julia, don't do anything! 
- OK !

318
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:01,261
- I'll guide you. 
- I would suck at rowing!

319
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,353
I don't think 
he can hear us.

320
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:10,000
The to a sonotone.

321
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,499
- Really ? 
- Yeah.

322
00:16:11,624 --> 00:16:13,006
He left it at home.

323
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,508
Do you think 
they will try to do

324
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,787
a female alliance 
with Aubry and Debbie?

325
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,614
That's why we need 
a majority. A fourth.

326
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:24,793
Scott and Jason

327
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,078
worry about a female alliance.

328
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,045
Me, not so much. 
I do not believe it.

329
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,342
But whatever.

330
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,360
Guys have to stay in the majority.

331
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:36,104
- So it must be a girl. 
- Fire a girl and not a guy.

332
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,090
Yeah, it has to 
be one of them.

333
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,377
How was it ?

334
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:42,986
Meager peach?

335
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:44,678
Just a handful like that.

336
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,539
When the girls return

337
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:48,942
I wanted to check in with Julia.

338
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,887
We are on the same wavelength, 
strategically.

339
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,559
- Any news on the boat? 
- No nothing.

340
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,329
Jason and Scotus

341
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,213
fear a female alliance.

342
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,358
Yeah, there's no such thing.

343
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,461
Something, with Nick,

344
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:10,864
it is that he is the least discreet 
on this island.

345
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:15,844
He takes 50 steps and turns around, 
where I can see him talking.

346
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,937
Can we do more stupid?

347
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,216
I had tics in my face, 
I said to myself:

348
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,143
"My God, I'm going to freak out!"

349
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:28,876
Nothing. Everything is fine.

350
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:32,926
Nick came back,

351
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,174
he looked at Scot and Jason, like, 
"Oh, she didn't say anything!"

352
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:37,660
And me, I was...

353
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:42,451
You sent Nick 
to find out about me?

354
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,154
When we came back,

355
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,588
Nick went to talk with Julia.

356
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:51,322
Really ? If you send someone 
to inquire about us,

357
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,905
find better than Nick 
in terms of facial expressions!

358
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,111
When we got back, Nick said, 
"They didn't say anything."

359
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:00,144
I find that suspicious.

360
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,948
You should have asked me. 
I'm not plotting against you.

361
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:07,135
We sent nobody 
to inquire about anybody.

362
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,692
We know. We sent nobody 
to inquire about anybody.

363
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:12,019
It is not you.

364
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:15,779
Hmm, you were 
looking at me weirdly.

365
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:17,464
Shall we fetch water?

366
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:19,225
Sure.

367
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:22,836
Scott, Nick and I,

368
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:26,748
it was hoped that there would be no 
female alliance.

369
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,642
Then Nick took the initiative 
to ask a girl the question.

370
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,787
But it pissed off Cydney.

371
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:34,456
Paranoia will eventually set in.

372
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:37,259
It may have happened 
earlier than expected.

373
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,314
What the fuck was this?

374
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,663
It was legit.

375
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,530
I don't know what you said.

376
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,800
- I will tell you. 
- What ?

377
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,842
We sat down and Nick said:

378
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,130
"Are they talking 
about a female alliance?"

379
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,840
And Scott said:

380
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,709
"I don't know, 
we'll see when Cydney comes back."

381
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,210
Nick wasn't asked to 
say or do anything.

382
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,525
And then you freaked out.

383
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,116
No, I asked a question.

384
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,851
I wanted to be clear,

385
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,201
because I said to myself: 
"Who does he think he is?"

386
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:06,526
I had to clarify:

387
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:08,579
"Don't watch me, 
you're not my father!"

388
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:11,229
It's like, the boys 
talk to whoever they want,

389
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:14,455
and if I talk to someone, 
"Oh, is there a girl's alliance?"

390
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,264
And me: "Oh no, no, no!

391
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,219
You don't know 
Angry Cydney.

392
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:19,868
She'll blow it all away!"

393
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,228
I'll talk about the idol, 
nothing to polish!

394
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:24,205
You know I got you covered.

395
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,006
Let him know who I am. 
Nothing to do with the other girls.

396
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:28,601
Don't watch me, mate.

397
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:31,780
The current plan 
is to split the votes

398
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,576
between Aubry and Miss Debbie

399
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:35,566
until the departure 
of all Intelligence.

400
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:37,844
But if the boys have to leave, 
they will leave.

401
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,538
Over here, everyone!

402
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:09,175
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

403
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:11,620
First of all Nick...

404
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,180
It didn't help, but you know 
you can win!

405
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:16,063
Yeah. Marvellous.

406
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,260
Oh, come on, Nick!

407
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:22,297
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

408
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,423
Today,

409
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:26,334
you will be balancing 
on a very narrow support,

410
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,162
hanging from handles 
behind your heads.

411
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,448
If you let go of the handle

412
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,855
or a foot leaves the support,

413
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,647
it's lost.

414
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,238
The last person standing 
wins immunity.

415
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:41,574
The losers: on the council, 
someone will be eliminated

416
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,286
after 22 hard days

417
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:45,636
in this game.

418
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,889
Good. 
Take a seat, let's get started.

419
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,886
Well, on and go.

420
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,855
hands behind head,

421
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,280
hands on the back of the handle,

422
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,936
both feet 
must remain on the support.

423
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:03,980
Good. 
Everyone is in position.

424
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:07,042
This test is on.

425
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:13,840
Everyone looks good.

426
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:19,543
There are ten people left in the game. 
Someone will win immunity.

427
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:22,268
A guaranteed place 
in the last nine.

428
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:25,289
It's going to be painful, and fast.

429
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,810
You will feel it quickly.

430
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,890
Tai, you are struggling.

431
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,761
The first signs of pain.

432
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,980
A beautiful day, 
warm and sunny.

433
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:45,839
Elapsed Time: 5 Minutes

434
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:48,608
Someone to acknowledge 
that he's already hurting?

435
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,312
Let's get comfortable!

436
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:58,093
Debbie, is this what you imagined 
when you signed up for Survivor?

437
00:21:58,218 --> 00:21:59,352
It's a bit worse.

438
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,224
Good. You've been up there 
long enough

439
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,367
to get an idea of ​​what's next.

440
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,727
Oh, my back!

441
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:10,597
A very uncomfortable position,

442
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:12,822
very hot sun.

443
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,610
And it will only get worse.

444
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,804
But some of you

445
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,806
feel safe for tonight.

446
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:21,750
You are not going to leave.

447
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,177
You may not admit 
it on the camp,

448
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,787
then i will try you

449
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,614
for you to admit it now.

450
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:30,316
I will bring food.

451
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:31,693
Oh my God !

452
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,118
But beware :

453
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:37,060
this will be your one and only opportunity 
to indulge yourself.

454
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,904
So you have to ask yourself,

455
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,162
while I'm going 
to get the food:

456
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,162
"Will I come down

457
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:46,678
and give up immunity to eat,

458
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:50,623
or could it be 
a million dollar mistake?"

459
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:54,207
Don't come down 
until I suggest it.

460
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,190
I can't !

461
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:01,348
I say. I could not.

462
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:05,039
Oh, Julia, I'm sorry I 
missed that!

463
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:06,165
I say...

464
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,696
And sorry for you,

465
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,721
it just happened too soon.

466
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,025
You will not take part in this.

467
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,027
Oh, it's a buffet!

468
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:15,870
- Four pizzas. 
- Oh my God !

469
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,864
Brownies. 
Chicken drumsticks.

470
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:23,636
And you have to get that through.

471
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:26,214
Cool drinks.

472
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,741
- I take. 
- That works.

473
00:23:28,152 --> 00:23:30,852
You will have ten seconds. 
I will count.

474
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,279
After that, no more temptations.

475
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,811
Oh, Jeff, quick!

476
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:36,750
Let's go. Ten,

477
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:38,469
new...

478
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:40,262
- I take. 
- ...eight,

479
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:45,100
Five... 
Five seconds left.

480
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:46,226
Four,

481
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:47,768
three,

482
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,496
of them,

483
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:50,622
and...

484
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:52,499
I'm staying.

485
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,676
And There you go.

486
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,251
Jason came down. 
Scotus is down.

487
00:23:57,643 --> 00:23:58,705
Joe came down.

488
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,063
Michele came down.

489
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,651
That's a lot of food 
for four people.

490
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:05,854
It remains :

491
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:13,284
who are still vying for immunity.

492
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:14,696
- Tai. 
- Yes ?

493
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:16,389
Have you considered going down?

494
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:20,660
I want to go all the way, see how far 
I can push my body.

495
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:24,539
And I don't want 
an Intelligence to win.

496
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:30,365
Wow ! Nick, that's 
a bold statement.

497
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:33,247
Yeah, that's obvious at this point.

498
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,422
What ?

499
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:36,343
That the Intelligences 
are in the minority.

500
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:38,276
That it is one of the three,

501
00:24:40,738 --> 00:24:41,790
and Debbie,

502
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,283
who is in danger.

503
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:48,126
I can't.

504
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,956
Debbie can't take it anymore.

505
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:52,992
Debbie is eliminated 
and you are down to four.

506
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:56,589
Debbie joins Julia,

507
00:24:56,714 --> 00:25:00,300
eliminated, but without the possibility 
of eating or drinking.

508
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:01,835
How's it going, Jason?

509
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,798
Perfectly.

510
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:09,542
Four people 
can still gain immunity.

511
00:25:10,324 --> 00:25:12,454
Aubry, it shows on your face.

512
00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:15,107
It's painful.

513
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,887
Without warning, Aubry descends,

514
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:22,764
and just behind Aubry,

515
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,959
Suddenly, 
you are only two.

516
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,396
Nick, how are you feeling 
about tonight?

517
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:32,173
Considering that as you approach 
your first council,

518
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:33,708
you decide to go down

519
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,239
and waive immunity.

520
00:25:35,364 --> 00:25:38,091
Yeah, I've thought 
all along that it's in the pocket for Cydney.

521
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:40,882
It's a decision to make: 
get off

522
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:44,144
or ensure that all Intelligence 
is eliminated.

523
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:45,979
I will have to wait.

524
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:50,125
But I'm also excited 
to finally go after 22 days.

525
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,894
Hoping 
it's not bittersweet.

526
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,088
It won't be, mate.

527
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:57,524
No, I know.

528
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:03,626
That's Cydney.

529
00:26:03,907 --> 00:26:06,050
Competing for immunity.

530
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:08,134
Are n't you feeling 
a little numb, Cydney?

531
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:10,212
No, it's going tip-top.

532
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:12,372
How it is possible ?

533
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:14,107
I don't know, she's so...

534
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,846
ELAPSED TIME: 30 Minutes

535
00:26:17,714 --> 00:26:19,721
Tai, the Intelligences 
are all gone.

536
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:21,481
More than Cydney and you.

537
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:23,445
Do you think you can beat her

538
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,994
or is it a personal challenge?

539
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:28,488
I want to see 
how far I can push.

540
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:32,125
But... She can't 
be that strong.

541
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:35,028
Sometimes strong people

542
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:37,664
remain strong and suddenly crack.

543
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:39,741
I am like a bamboo.

544
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:42,702
The wind blows, blows... 
I am resistant.

545
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:46,239
I knew the war, 
the refugee camp.

546
00:26:46,364 --> 00:26:47,741
It is not comparable.

547
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,676
She's a sturdy redwood,

548
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:51,745
but she might crack.

549
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,680
Not soon, Tai, not soon!

550
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:59,228
That's Cydney.

551
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:02,304
Very different sizes.

552
00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:06,701
But both seem to share 
the same frame of mind.

553
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:09,170
Oh no, not now!

554
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,465
ELAPSED TIME: 40 Minutes

555
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:12,340
It's been 40 minutes now.

556
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,934
- It's crazy ! 
- What resistance!

557
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:22,075
Tai, despite your visible pain, 
you are still in on it.

558
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,887
At this point, 
it's one second after another.

559
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:27,981
I invoke Buddha.

560
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:31,651
What's he saying ?

561
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,486
No, I'm just chanting.

562
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,730
"Faith in Buddha."

563
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,290
"Faith in Buddha."

564
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:39,592
"Faith in Buddha."

565
00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:53,362
You suffer.

566
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:55,750
I saw it on your face.

567
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:11,454
Without warning,

568
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,703
the most unlikely happens!

569
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,675
Tai wins individual immunity!

570
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,067
Congratulations to you !

571
00:28:21,192 --> 00:28:23,645
Incredible turn of events!

572
00:28:27,132 --> 00:28:28,274
Oh, my back!

573
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:33,121
I have never seen anything like it.

574
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:45,267
- Tai, can you come here? 
- Yes.

575
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:46,817
And even run!

576
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,804
- Tai. 
- Thank you, Jeff.

577
00:28:51,802 --> 00:28:52,899
You wanted it.

578
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:55,824
I don't know if you really thought you 
could achieve this,

579
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:57,979
but you never gave up.

580
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,899
Tai is protected. 
Individual immunity.

581
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:02,642
As for you, someone will leave 
after 22 days.

582
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,244
But Tai showed it:

583
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,845
keep fighting,

584
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,189
until the end, until the vote.

585
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,207
Congratulation. 
You are safe tonight.

586
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,930
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

587
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:17,372
Tonight, 
the Beauties are voting for Debbie.

588
00:29:17,497 --> 00:29:20,068
The Muscles vote for Aubry.

589
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,095
I'm safe tonight, 
but who knows?

590
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:24,706
I won the 
individual immunity test.

591
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:25,832
I earned it.

592
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:29,235
It was quite an ordeal.

593
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:44,984
Tai was amazing.

594
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:49,831
I saw ultra-marathoners, 
people running in the Sahara...

595
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:51,799
It was excellent, sir!

596
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,127
What stamina!

597
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,339
You were like a statue

598
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,108
and I will... cook you some food.

599
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,550
You had a good day ?

600
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:06,837
The plan for tonight 
is to split the votes

601
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:09,619
between Debbie and Aubry.

602
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,220
If an idol is played,

603
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:15,048
We'll get her out of the way, 
but Debbie should go.

604
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:17,516
And Aubry 
is in a weak position.

605
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,527
Someone has to take advantage of it.

606
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:22,022
That should be me. 
That's my opinion anyway.

607
00:30:22,883 --> 00:30:25,538
What have you got planned 
with Debbie and Joe?

608
00:30:25,663 --> 00:30:28,655
I'm just waiting to 
be told what's going on,

609
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,664
because we were clearly... 
public enemy number one.

610
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,911
Yes, that's obvious.

611
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:37,345
So... We're going to split the votes.

612
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,715
All Muscles and Beauty. 
And we divide 4 - 3.

613
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:45,257
Between you 
and the other two Intelligences.

614
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:47,598
So you have to make 
the right decision

615
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:50,377
by voting for Debbie or Joe.

616
00:30:50,842 --> 00:30:54,362
I would suggest voting Debbie, 
but I didn't tell you.

617
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:56,256
I know 
you're in this position,

618
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:57,986
but I have to take advantage of it.

619
00:30:58,111 --> 00:30:59,588
I think you understand.

620
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:02,283
I know 
I'm being arrogant, but...

621
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:04,472
- But at least you admit it. 
- No, I know.

622
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:05,598
No, yeah.

623
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:09,922
It's not my habit 
to reveal myself like this.

624
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:13,710
But hey, if nobody 
wants to take advantage of Aubry, I will.

625
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:15,241
When you're down,

626
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:16,950
I'm here for you !

627
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,013
And... she knows it.

628
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:21,755
But she can't do anything about it. 
Not immediately.

629
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:30,350
I wanted to discuss...

630
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:34,531
With Aubry and you, 
before Nick comes back.

631
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:39,200
On trial, Nick's arrogance 
really pissed me off.

632
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:42,002
Such confidence 
is ridiculous.

633
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:45,614
Nick has the melon 
and he gets on my nerves.

634
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:49,417
What do you have in mind for the vote?

635
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,833
We are tied for now.

636
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,241
5 - 5, women and men.

637
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:54,914
We must strike now.

638
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,001
- Do you want to go out Nick? 
- Exactly.

639
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:59,285
- I knew it. I suspected it. 
- He must go.

640
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,460
I like the idea of ​​it being Nick.

641
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:04,886
Here comes Cydney approaching us, 
Aubry and I,

642
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:07,459
and said, "Let's get out Nick!"

643
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:10,714
I still hoped 
that Nick would come to us

644
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,995
and we could take out 
Jason or Scot,

645
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,622
but, Nick, 
first come, first served!

646
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:19,039
I am 100% ready, decided.

647
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:21,164
- Aubry, how about you? 
- Leaving.

648
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,160
Bargain.

649
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,480
My interest, for the future,

650
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:29,015
is to make sure the girls 
stay as close as possible.

651
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,661
It makes more sense to me 
to play with only girls.

652
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:36,782
If it does, well, 
I'll be the first to react.

653
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:48,577
How do you feel about it tonight?

654
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,396
Are you comfortable 
with the division of votes?

655
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:54,902
Are you close to Nick?

656
00:32:55,027 --> 00:32:58,264
We come from the same tribe. 
But he likes watching me.

657
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:01,412
He always says, "Are you following the plan?" 
And me: "Yeah!

658
00:33:01,537 --> 00:33:04,492
I'm following the plan, Nick, 
nothing's changed!"

659
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:08,813
Are you up 
for voting Nick tonight?

660
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:10,249
- Nick? 
- Yes.

661
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:13,577
He is the person who is the most

662
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:16,162
in Jason and Scot's pocket.

663
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:18,608
Do we talk to Aubry and...?

664
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:20,387
It's already done.

665
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:21,919
Cydney would like to take Nick out.

666
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:24,040
She thinks it dangerous 
and I agree.

667
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:25,539
But he's also my ally

668
00:33:25,664 --> 00:33:28,895
and I think I can collaborate 
a little more with him.

669
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,953
So I don't know if it suits me right now 
.

670
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:34,433
Between girls, 
we should stick together.

671
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:35,982
Absolutely.

672
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:39,196
The original plan 
was to take Debbie out.

673
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:42,731
So there are many choices 
at this point.

674
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,301
It's about figuring out the right 
one for Julia and me.

675
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,743
Do you agree with the plan?

676
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:50,943
Yeah.

677
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:54,067
I want to make sure you're comfortable.

678
00:33:57,023 --> 00:33:59,439
Jason will have us in the crosshairs.

679
00:34:00,325 --> 00:34:03,718
You can feel the electricity in the air, 
before the advice.

680
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:05,779
A power struggle unfolds.

681
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:09,502
It is obvious on the camp. 
Lots of egos and personalities.

682
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,136
At some point 
we gotta do something

683
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,666
that allows us 
to take power.

684
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,531
I want to be able to take a hit

685
00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:20,769
who consolidates my image 
of someone deserving.

686
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,129
You have to find the right timing.

687
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,814
Nick and Michele, grab a torch

688
00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:42,891
and light it in the fire.

689
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:46,294
It is part 
of the council ritual,

690
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:49,243
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

691
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:51,458
If he disappears, so do you.

692
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:57,263
Here is now 
the first member of our jury.

693
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:04,537
which was extracted from the game 
by the medical team,

694
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,550
recovered enough to be 
with us this evening at the council.

695
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,278
So Michele.

696
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:15,156
Escape the council for 22 days

697
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,192
is the best you can 
hope for.

698
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:18,318
And yet,

699
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:22,628
something about coming here 
fuels Survivor fever.

700
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,217
Yes, going 22 days 
without advice is great,

701
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:30,170
but you don't show 
how you play, who you are,

702
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,364
before being here,

703
00:35:31,707 --> 00:35:32,894
to the council.

704
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:37,370
Debbie, what did you notice 
when this band finally came together?

705
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,839
Initially, it was not clear.

706
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,118
Now the ancient tribes

707
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:45,138
seem to have remained distinct,

708
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:47,055
but Muscles and Beauty

709
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,924
actually merged.

710
00:35:49,338 --> 00:35:51,624
Nick, we heard 
this comment today:

711
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,653
"An Intelligence will go away."

712
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,955
Hey! The Intelligences are on the sidelines.

713
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,801
We're going to split the votes 
and move on from there.

714
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:02,137
Aubry, who's together?

715
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:08,790
and Julia.

716
00:36:08,915 --> 00:36:12,105
I turned on today, 
like Cochran's dream girl,

717
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,196
horribly distressed,

718
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,351
because I am helpless

719
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:17,977
to make them move.

720
00:36:18,102 --> 00:36:19,487
And yet, Julia,

721
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:22,082
it would be a great time 
to make a move.

722
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:23,780
For in these seven,

723
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:25,518
someone is at the bottom of the scale.

724
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,821
People feel confident right 
now.

725
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:32,058
It is always possible 
to branch off later.

726
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,184
Jason, that's fear, 
isn't it?

727
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:35,770
You have a great plan.

728
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:38,940
As long as everyone sticks to it.

729
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:42,068
I've been repeating it for three days: 
"We stay united.

730
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:46,462
We are sure to get to seven, 
and then we will face each other."

731
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:49,185
And everyone in the covenant said to me:

732
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:52,520
Scot, how to insure

733
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,322
that the seven stay together?

734
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:56,758
By not having six days 
between two councils.

735
00:36:58,009 --> 00:37:00,829
So that really changed the game.

736
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:03,738
Yes, it was tough. 
Many ideas were considered.

737
00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:07,093
But the game started again today. 
We are here tonight.

738
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:08,403
And honestly,

739
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:10,605
I think the seven very close-knit.

740
00:37:12,098 --> 00:37:14,860
Tai, were there discussions 
about idols,

741
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:16,936
whether there is or not?

742
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:21,283
Yeah, we didn't 
think there were until...

743
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,458
fusion.

744
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,944
We found 
out that Neal might have one.

745
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:27,512
And we also heard about 
a super-idol.

746
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:32,513
When two idols merge, 
they form a super-idol

747
00:37:32,638 --> 00:37:36,331
which can be played after the vote.

748
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:41,058
You say "we" 
and Julia didn't know.

749
00:37:41,183 --> 00:37:42,737
She twisted her neck

750
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:44,595
turning back to you.

751
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,433
I thought everyone knew.

752
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,539
Aubry, why 
this big reaction?

753
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:54,334
She was not in the confidence.

754
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:57,552
This may be an indicator 
of his true position.

755
00:37:57,677 --> 00:37:59,979
Jeff. Someone 
is at the bottom of the ladder.

756
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,875
And this super-idol, 
and your ignorance about it,

757
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,896
if it doesn't show 
you that you're clearly down,

758
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:11,766
and if you want to act, 
it's still possible tonight.

759
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,736
Tai, you shake your head.

760
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,266
What troubles you?

761
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:19,441
I was told about the super-idol. 
Now I say to myself:

762
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:22,535
"Maybe that person 
didn't tell me about it

763
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,172
only to make me doubt 
what is going on."

764
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:29,050
So, sitting here, I'm like, "Wow!

765
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,254
Are you playing me?"

766
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:38,026
Debbie, hearing 
all that is being said tonight,

767
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,199
a hope ?

768
00:38:39,324 --> 00:38:40,795
Oh, I still have hope.

769
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,955
Absolutely.

770
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,256
Very often,

771
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:45,533
more things are hidden

772
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,736
than hidden here.

773
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:49,409
Aubrey, and you?

774
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:51,364
Do you expect 
votes tonight?

775
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:53,166
Oh, yeah, definitely.

776
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,378
Scot, will it be 
a surprise elimination tonight?

777
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,371
Or... as expected?

778
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:02,342
I can't imagine it going 
any other way than planned.

779
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,822
Good. It's time to vote.

780
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:08,948
Tai, over to you.

781
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,001
Sorry, my daughter. 
It is division.

782
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:33,006
See you later, Debbie!

783
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:34,479
It was nice.

784
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:47,954
Overconfidence 
is a weakness.

785
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,639
I will count the votes.

786
00:40:13,771 --> 00:40:16,760
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

787
00:40:16,885 --> 00:40:18,827
now is the time to do it.

788
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,598
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

789
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:26,259
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

790
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:27,861
I will read the votes.

791
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:42,609
Aubrey. Two Aubry votes.

792
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:50,792
Nick. Two votes Nick,

793
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:53,620
two Aubry votes, one Debbie vote, 
one Jason vote.

794
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,724
Nick. That's three Nick votes.

795
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:04,264
- Nick. That's four votes Nick... 
- Oh, damn it!

796
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:07,334
...two Aubry votes, 
one Debbie vote, one Jason vote.

797
00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:15,356
Seventh person eliminated 
and second member of the jury:

798
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:18,144
Nick, that's five and that's enough. 
Bring me your torch.

799
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:31,991
Nick, the tribe has spoken.

800
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,262
It's time to go.

801
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:45,680
This is one of the hallmarks of 
this game.

802
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:47,976
As long as you keep 
fighting,

803
00:41:48,101 --> 00:41:49,843
everything can happen.

804
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:51,945
Take your torches, 
return to camp.

805
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,120
Good night.

806

Stay with us, to see

810
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:10,497
Next time in Survivor...

811
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:13,909
After a surprise elimination, 
the men want revenge.

812
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:16,611
We took the ax and the machete. 
We want to starve them.

813
00:42:16,736 --> 00:42:18,747
Do you want to shoot us down? 
We will shoot you!

814
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,445
It's psychological warfare.

815
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,308
And it tears women apart.

816
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:24,386
Julia has it both ways.

817
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:27,247
But sometimes the guy in the middle 
of the road gets run over.

818
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:30,169
First and last tip.

819
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:32,062
Obviously, it turns out bittersweet.

820
00:42:32,187 --> 00:42:33,406
And I deserve it.

821
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:35,237
I was way too confident tonight.

822
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:36,926
It's a surprise, that's for sure.

823
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:40,966
I didn't see what was going on, 
and I take my hat off to them.

824
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:44,089
I will remain too confident, 
smug and arrogant,

825
00:42:44,214 --> 00:42:46,308
but I should have struck before them,

826
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:48,374
and I didn't, that's all.
