"Rat" and "cancer" were the two

103
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,367
that I remember the most.

104
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,165
Adam and Parvati are angry that

105
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,459
I flopped, and I'm absolutely

106
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,377
convinced I made the right

107
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,629
decision.

108
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,922
Everybody needs a bad guy, so I

109
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,923
become the bad guy, and

110
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,466
everybody else is good, nobody

111
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,217
else has lied, nobody else has

112
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,343

up and just keep punching.

00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,273
We're getting very close to

386
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,526
somebody winning this.

387
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,402
Mike and Parvati are very close!

388
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,155
That flag is raising!

389
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,991
You've got to hit the wood.

390
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:52,748
Jonathan's flag is now raising.

391
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,667
>> Right here, baby!

392
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,001
>> PROBST: It's Jonathan and

393
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,046
Parvati.

394
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:05,010
Parvati wins reward!

395
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,640
>> Good job, Parvati.

396
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,099
>> I'm sorry, baby.

397
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,102
>> Damn it!

398
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,354
>> PROBST: Nice job.

399
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,063
>> Thank you.

400
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:16,605
>> PROBST: First order of

401
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,982
business: you have to choose one

402
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,483
of these six to leave right now

403
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,485
and go to Exile Island.

404
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:28,409
>> Jonathan.

405
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,076
>> PROBST: Jonathan not even

406
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,451
asking permission.

407
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,078
He's taking a good-bye.

408
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,838
>> Love you.

409
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,762
>> PROBST: Now to the more fun

410
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,347
part of the reward.

411
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,140
Two other survivors...

412
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,727
(<i> laughter</i> )

413
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,020
...and their loved ones will

414
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,897
join you on this reward.

415
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,107
And, Mike, you're going to

416
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,026
decide who it is with no help

417
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,068
from you.

418
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,278
>> Oh...!

419
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,029
>> PROBST: No talking from the

420
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:05,988
survivors.

421
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,198
Who are you taking with you?

422
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,618
>> Oh, man.

423
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,953
Uh...

424
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:17,666
Oh...

425
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,877
Island lady, Jeanette.

426
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,962
>> Oh, beautiful ladies!

427
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,006
>> PROBST: Jeanette, Sundra,

428
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,132
come over here.

429
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,801
(<i> applause</i> )

430
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,053
One more choice.

431
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,180
>> George, right?

432
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,141
>> PROBST: Adam's dad, George.

433
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:39,688
>> Yes!

434
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,481
>> PROBST: Loved ones, it's been

435
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,940
a pleasure having you here.

436
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:42,524
It's time for you guys to go.

437
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,525
You can head back the way you

438
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:49,073
came in.

439
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,032
Well, the good news is you're

440
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,618
all going back to camp together.

441
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,203
>> Yay!

442
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,037
>> PROBST: Sundra, Adam,

443
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,831
Parvati, loved ones, boat will

444
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,957
pick you up in a few hours, take

445
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,334
you to your reward.

446
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,168
All right, take them back to

447
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,004
camp, guys.

448
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,941
>> So you're back at camp.

449
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,192
Do you believe I've been here

450
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,026
for 31 days?

451
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,902
>> Yeah.

452
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:27,903
>> I was, like, squealing and

453
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:28,487
jumping up and down when I won

454
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,447
because it was just so

455
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,241
unexpected, but I needed it.

456
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,702
It showed me that I am still in

457
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,285
this game and, you know, that

458
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,788
I still have a fighting chance.

459
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,455
This is home.

460
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,331
I'll give you a tour.

461
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,543
Here's the living room.

462
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,836
>> I'm really glad because I

463
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,920
couldn't describe this in words,

464
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:45,254
I don't think.

465
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,381
It was great to see George here.

466
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,299
George is my dad, and I call him

467
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,050
George because he's my best

468
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,511
friend.

469
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,137
I'm surprised I lasted this

470
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,345
long.

471
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,139
>> Well, I'm proud of you,

472
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,223
buddy.

473
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,808
>> I told you, don't...

474
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,017
The chances of me lasting past

475
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
tomorrow are slim.

476
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,150
>> Okay.

477
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,110
>> I could get into this.

478
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,070
>> Yes, for a day.

479
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,448
I think having my mom come here

480
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
and see it, it's going to give

481
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,201
her a whole new perspective that

482
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,162
I probably could never get

483
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,288
across.

484
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,330
I mean, this is something that

485
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,457
my mom probably would never have

486
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,916
had in her whole lifetime.

487
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,292
>> Interesting.

488
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,209
That's what we have to drink?

489
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,252
>> Yes, we boil it.

490
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,171
So I think actually we're going

491
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,547
to get some tonight because we

492
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,758
filled up our water bottles.

493
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,551
>> Want to see the house where

494
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,178
we sleep?

495
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:38,015
>> Yeah.

496
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,059
>> That's awesome!

497
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,313
(<i> laughter</i> )

498
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,230
>> It's kind of annoying having

499
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,190
the camp be overrun with the

500
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,693
competitors' family.

501
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,319
Parvati and Adam depend on the

502
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,279
food that we provide them, so I

503
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,907
almost feel responsible for

504
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,408
helping them be strong enough to

505
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:01,830
win that challenge.

506
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,915
>> Here it comes.

507
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:07,169
You ready?

508
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,087
>> All right, bye-bye.

509
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:09,755
>> Bye.

510
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,547
>> Have a good time.

511
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:10,881
>> Bye, guys.

512
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,382
>> See you guys later.

513
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,230
>> Me, too.

514
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:26,980
>> Yeah!

515
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:27,439
>> It's really nice.

516
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,315
>> I agree.

517
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,400
>> Laid back.

518
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,238
>> Exactly!

519
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,384
>> It was unbelievable.

520
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,470
We got greeted by at least 100

521
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,138
people, women and children, just

522
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,640
singing to us and, like, we were

523
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,891
celebrated.

524
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,350
It was fabulous.

525
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,352
I loved it.

526
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,399
>> We have no idea what they're

527
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,358
singing, you know.

528
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:11,733
It's just amazing.

529
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,861
The little kids are around us.

530
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,697
And then they walk us to this

531
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,490
cave, and in this cave, there's

532
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,199
fresh water.

533
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,452
It was, like oh, my god!

534
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,912
Like a little piece of heaven

535
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,664
just dropped right off the side

536
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,749
of the road.

537
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,556
>> They do it twice a year, this

538
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,641
religious ceremony where they,

539
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,603
like, bless the cave water, sing

540
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,855
and pray, and it's just a

541
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,398
ceremonial occasion, and I was

542
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,442
so grateful that that was part

543
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,568
of the reward.

544
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,278
And it was like, I mean, just a

545
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,489
once-in-a-lifetime thing that

546
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,367
happened.

547
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,162
(<i> applause and cheers</i> )

548
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,247
>> Whoo!

549
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,426
>> I haven't had fresh water in

550
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,886
32 days.

551
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,471
It was so cool and refreshing.

552
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,388
And when I came up, our skin

553
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,348
smelled nice because of the oil.

554
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:28,560
It felt so good.

555
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,647
(<i> cheers</i> )

556
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,453
>> The world is getting much

557
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,454
smaller, and it would only

558
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,498
benefit us if we took the time

559
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,001
to learn about somebody else.

560
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,794
Because guaranteed there's at

561
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,461
least one thing that we have in

562
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:58,465
common.

563
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,344
>> Oh, my god!

564
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,263
Oh, my god!

565
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,598
Are those biscuits?!

566
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,517
It was unbelievable.

567
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,061
The blanket was just full of

568
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,771
fried chicken, meat loaf,

569
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,147
biscuits-- I mean, I'm a

570
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:14,773
Southern girl.

571
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,192
I love chicken and biscuits.

572
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:17,985
I am so glad I won that

573
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,028
challenge.

574
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,655
>> As you should.

575
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,323
>> That is good.

576
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,366
>> Oh, my god!

577
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,451
>> Go for it, Adam.

578
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:28,870
>> Got to beat Jonathan

579
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,955
tomorrow.

580
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:30,706
That's our goal for the rest of

581
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,332
the time we're here.

582
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,500
We just have to beat him at

583
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,794
everything.

584
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,586
I feel like I'm about to

585
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,546
explode.

586
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,506
>> Oh, gluttony is so good.

587
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,758
Adam and Parvati without

588
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,509
Jonathan around are a lot more

589
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,344
chilled out, and we got a chance

590
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,847
to just talk, find out a little

591
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,181
bit more about each other and

592
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,267
just be really calm.

593
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,119
>> I think we should do

594
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,454
something.

595
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,789
>> All I know is I can't keep

596
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,207
feeding Adam and Parvati and

597
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,834
have them win.

598
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:16,543
>> You don't think it's fair, in

599
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,085
a sense, to feed people like

600
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,628
your enemies.

601
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,508
>> No, I understand.

602
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,057
Ozzy catches pretty much most

603
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,850
of our food, and Adam and

604
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,018
Parvati keep on winning these

605
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,519
challenges.

606
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,605
So I think at this point, we've

607
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,439
tentatively decided to keep on

608
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,025
catching food, but maybe hide

609
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,693
some of it from Adam and

610
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,779
Parvati.

611
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,365
>> I think we should just throw

612
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:47,866
them in the woods.

613
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,951
>> Right there.

614
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,667
>> Now is a key, pivotal moment,

615
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,127
and I don't want to feed people

616
00:22:59,211 --> 00:22:59,628
that beat me.

617
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,797
So for Adam, Parvati, and

618
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,840
Jonathan, no more coconuts.

619
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,843
They can go get their own.

620
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,361
>> How was it?

621
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,238
>> Hi!

622
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,240
>> Hi, Parvati.

623
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:28,532
>> Hi, guys.

624
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,575
How are you?

625
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,701
>> Tell us all about it.

626
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,869
>> This is a survival game, so

627
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,204
the issue is just trying to have

628
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,539
an upper edge in the game and

629
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,374
not feeding someone so they can

630
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,667
beat you.

631
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,669
And Adam is the biggest guy, and

632
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,962
he eats the most.

633
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,004
And so the less food he eats,

634
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,965
the more drained he gets.

635
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:45,590
>> If you can't get your own

636
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,426
food at this point, then maybe

637
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,512
you shouldn't be in the game.

638
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,646
>> Oh, my god!

639
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,356
Oh, my...

640
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,607
Thank you!

641
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,025
>> I'm not done yet.

642
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,155
>> Oh, my god!

643
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,740
The original plan for Ozzy and

644
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,826
myself and also Yul was to sort

645
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,202
of hide the coconuts, hide the

646
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:14,786
food, you know, to save it for

647
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,872
us for later.

648
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,832
But after we saw that Adam and

649
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,292
Parvati brought back so much

650
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,586
food, we sort of felt bad.

651
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,920
I think the hiding plan is sort

652
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,504
of on the outs.

653
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,590
>> Guys, thank you, seriously.

654
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:29,926
>> People seem more chilled out

655
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,137
if we're just our six without

656
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,556
Jonathan, so it's sort of nice

657
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,933
that he's on Exile right now.

658
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,436
>> Oh, Yul's going to cry!

659
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,521
(<i> laughter</i> )

660
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:55,744
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

661
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,078
We'll now bring in Jonathan

662
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,164
returning from Exile Island.

663
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,378
>> Thanks, guys.

664
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,639
Hi, guys.

665
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,264
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

666
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,140
to today's challenge?

667
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:17,599
>> Yeah.

668
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,433
>> Yeah.

669
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,059
>> PROBST: First things first,

670
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,478
Adam, take back the necklace.

671
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,065
>> No more bling-bling, huh?

672
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,608
>> PROBST: Once again immunity

673
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,318
back up for grabs.

674
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,527
For today's challenge, you're

675
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,529
going to race out into the water

676
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,739
and maneuver across a series of

677
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,033
obstacles.

678
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,117
When you reach the end, you'll

679
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,827
retrieve a bundle of sticks and

680
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,204
race back.

681
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,247
You must then go out and do this

682
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,873
a second time.

683
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,625
Once you have both bundles back,

684
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,460
you'll untie the sticks and,

685
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,587
using the rope and the sticks,

686
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,923
build one long pole, which you

687
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:50,674
will then use to retrieve two

688
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,717
rings.

689
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,135
First person to retrieve both

690
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,055
rings wins immunity, guaranteed

691
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,598
a one-in-six shot at winning

692
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,642
this game and the million-dollar

693
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,686
check that goes along with it.

694
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,313
Losers, you know what happens:

695
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,523
tribal council tonight.

696
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,774
Somebody going home.

697
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,066
Make sense?

698
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,234
>> Yeah.

699
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:09,776
>> Yeah.

700
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,110
>> Absolutely.

701
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,319
>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots

702
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,405
and we'll get started.

703
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,913
For immunity, survivors ready?

704
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:26,835
Go!

705
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,587
Ozzy leading the pack.

706
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,966
He's first to the platform.

707
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,926
Yul up on the platform.

708
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,012
Jonathan right behind.

709
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:40,765
Yul in the water.

710
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,641
He's got to go back to the

711
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,101
platform.

712
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,144
Ozzy making quick work of this

713
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,062
course.

714
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:50,525
Not hesitating.

715
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,151
Ozzy in the water, swimming out

716
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,279
to his buoy.

717
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,448
Yul and Jonathan right behind.

718
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,615
Becky, Pavarti, Sundra on the

719
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,494
course.

720
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,120
Yul across the barrels, hanging

721
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,788
on!

722
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,586
Ozzy heading back with his first

723
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,671
bundle of sticks.

724
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:20,263
Yul swimming out to his bundle.

725
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:20,889
Parvati and Sundra making their

726
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,891
way across the balance beams as

727
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,393
Ozzy heads back.

728
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,353
Jonathan swimming out for his

729
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,480
first bundle.

730
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,524
Adam slides across the barrel.

731
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,610
Ozzy having no trouble.

732
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,572
Yul heading back with his first

733
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,326
bundle.

734
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,454
Ozzy back with his first bundle.

735
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,580
Becky and Parvati having a hard

736
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:49,459
time with the barrels.

737
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,043
Jonathan heads back with his

738
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,629
first bundle.

739
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,254
Adam working on the knots of his

740
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,174
first bundle while Ozzy is

741
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,259
getting ready to lap him.

742
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,432
Yul swimming back with his first

743
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,435
bundle of sticks.

744
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,728
Parvati struggling to hang on to

745
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,855
that barrel.

746
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,856
Parvati off again.

747
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,900
She's got to go back.

748
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,442
Yul's back with his first

749
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,861
bundle.

750
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,279
Everybody is having a hard time

751
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,323
with the barrels.

752
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,700
You're being too cautious.

753
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,621
Attack this course.

754
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,622
Jonathan slides across the

755
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,707
barrels.

756
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,587
Ozzy slides across the barrel

757
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,339
and makes it.

758
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,465
Ozzy swimming for his second

759
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,050
bundle.

760
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:39,884
Adam coming back with his first

761
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,678
bundle.

762
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,763
Jonathan's heading back.

763
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,227
Parvati makes it across.

764
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,687
She's swimming out for her first

765
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,939
bundle.

766
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,024
Ozzy's back on the course.

767
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,119
Yul across the barrels, swimming

768
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,037
out for his second bundle.

769
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,129
Ozzy passes Adam now, heading

770
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:20,800
back with his second bundle.

771
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,886
Jonathan taking his time.

772
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,971
Adam in no rush.

773
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,931
Ozzy already untying his

774
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,600
bundles, getting to work on his

775
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,227
pole.

776
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,855
Yul takes a nose dive.

777
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,814
Parvati off again.

778
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,109
Everybody falling.

779
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,194
Sundra takes a hard fall on the

780
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,029
barrels.

781
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,073
Lots of bumps and bruises.

782
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,118
Adam back with his first bundle.

783
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,453
Ozzy spacing it out, trying to

784
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,913
get an idea of how much pole he

785
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,415
has to work with.

786
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,541
Parvati back with her first

787
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,293
bundle.

788
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,753
Yul back with his second bundle.

789
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:01,174
He starts working on his pole.

790
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,342
Becky finally back with her

791
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,761
first bundle of sticks.

792
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,012
Down to Ozzy and Yul.

793
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,972
Who will get their pole together

794
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,057
first?

795
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,141
Whose will be strong enough to

796
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,186
work?

797
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,688
Ozzy's got his pole together.

798
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,774
Giving it a go.

799
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,155
Ozzy with his first ring back.

800
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,574
Ozzy doing it all with the pole.

801
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:31,037
Ozzy very close.

802
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,122
Ozzy wins immunity!

803
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,046
Ozzy, come on over.

804
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,464
(<i> applause</i> )

805
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,590
>> Good job.

806
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,508
>> PROBST: Once again, Ozzy is

807
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,884
safe tonight at tribal council.

808
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,010
Out of curiosity, anybody here

809
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,221
overly concerned that by not

810
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,055
winning they're in trouble

811
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,056
tonight?

812
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,308
Adam, Parvati.

813
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,101
Well, we'll see if your concerns

814
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,227
are warranted.

815
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,353
Tonight, tribal council,

816
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:55,895
somebody going home.

817
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:56,479
Grab your stuff, head back to

818
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,897
camp.

819
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,984
See you at tribal.

820
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,665
>> Immunity challenge was right

821
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:15,957
up my alley.

822
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,084
It was actually quite hilarious

823
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,587
seeing people just eating it all

824
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,964
over the place.

825
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,175
>> Big old nut, isn't it?

826
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,427
>> It's humongous.

827
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,052
>> Big green nuts.

828
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,138
(<i> laughter</i> )

829
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,784
>> How's your sister?

830
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,789
There's clearly something up.

831
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,041
People don't really know exactly

832
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,126
what to say to me, you know?

833
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,715
Something is afoot, no question.

834
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:06,966
Something has shifted.

835
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,635
How far it's shifted and how

836
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,011
much time I have to correct the

837
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,055
shift, I don't know.

838
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,806
If they're going to vote Adam

839
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,932
off tonight, then I've got two

840
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,309
days.

841
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,727
If they're going to vote me off,

842
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,811
I've got a couple of hours and

843
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,437
probably not a hell of a lot of

844
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,230
chance.

845
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,419
>> Yeah.

846
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,387
>> Great.

847
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,681
>> Some people might be like,

848
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,598
oh, you know, Jonathan's a

849
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,517
weasel and he... whatever,

850
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,352
weaseled his way in, but as far

851
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,896
as locking up the final four, if

852
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:02,522
Jonathan wasn't in it, who would

853
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,774
get it?

854
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,650
>> He was the only one that we

855
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:06,693
knew we could flip.

856
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,360
>> I understand that.

857
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,820
I don't think you're a bad

858
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,904
person for that at all.

859
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,197
I think that was good strategy,

860
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,532
it was great strategy.

861
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,950
But at this point, it doesn't

862
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,410
matter.

863
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,703
Why not have me or Parvati in

864
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,328
the fifth spot instead of... as

865
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,121
opposed to Jonathan?

866
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,957
>> Right.

867
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,916
It's a little bit weird for me

868
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:22,750
because I feel like I'm kind of

869
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,584
like the godfather or something

870
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,544
arranging a hit on somebody and

871
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,586
someone's asking, like, to take

872
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,087
out one person or another.

873
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,089
>> He doesn't deserve it.

874
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,340
>> The truth of the matter is I

875
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,383
don't know if I'm entirely

876
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,468
comfortable with it.

877
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,640
I will do everything I can to

878
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,516
keep you here because that

879
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,183
serves my interest.

880
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:39,976
>> I appreciate it.

881
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,560
>> If I can't...

882
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,394
>> Listen, clearly, the energy

883
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,729
has shifted.

884
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,271
And, you know, obviously, my

885
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,440
time away was a bad time to be

886
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,315
away.

887
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,692
You had a feast, you had guests,

888
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,318
you had food brought back for

889
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,320
you, and Parvati and Adam are

890
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,697
charming young people, they're

891
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,322
closer to your age than I am, et

892
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,158
cetera, et cetera.

893
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,161
But let's... you know, let's not

894
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:03,082
be stupid, please.

895
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,167
You know, I'm the perfect person

896
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,585
to keep around.

897
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,210
I'm not a threat in terms of

898
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,920
immunity.

899
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,797
And I saved your hide.

900
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,007
And I was happy to do it because

901
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,425
I felt like it made amends for

902
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,093
my stepping away, you know, and

903
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,887
they're going to say anything

904
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,388
they can.

905
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,848
Because if you fall for it, then

906
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,891
I'm gone, and they're still

907
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,142
around in the game, waiting to

908
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,561
take you guys out.

909
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,312
It would be stupid to vote me

910
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,730
out because I came back and I

911
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,107
saved my alliances' lives.

912
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,067
Are they really going to

913
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,693
sacrifice themselves and all

914
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,195
they've worked for because

915
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,906
Parvati is smiling at them now?

916
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,740
You know, because Adam is

917
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,491
stepping up and gathering a

918
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,576
little bit of wood?

919
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,085
>> Yeah.

920
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,170
It's either Jonathan or Adam,

921
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,588
because they seem to be the

922
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,966
biggest competitors right now.

923
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,509
It's really hard to pick,

924
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,928
though, which one is worse.

925
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,054
I think that, you know, as long

926
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,639
as the girls stay... stay

927
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,390
cool...

928
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,600
I think they will.

929
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,267
>> I think we're kind of set

930
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:03,643
anyways, right?

931
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,727
>> We're set...

932
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,311
>> I think the final four is

933
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:05,645
pretty much...

934
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,270
As long as no one does anything

935
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,981
crazy and the girls break, we're

936
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,984
there.

937
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:32,797
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

938
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,300
the members of our jury: Brad,

939
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:41,639
Rebecca, Jenny, Nate, and

940
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,223
Candice, voted out at the last

941
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,308
tribal council.

942
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:50,773
Pavarti, let's talk about the

943
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:51,816
reward.

944
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:52,900
Which was better, spending time

945
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,901
with your loved one or all that

946
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,777
food?

947
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,653
>> Hands down, spending time

948
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,320
with my dad, you know.

949
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,072
Seeing just the joy on their

950
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:58,823
faces.

951
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,866
They're so proud of us and what

952
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,366
we're doing right now.

953
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,368
You know, and then when we went

954
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,953
on the reward and we were, like,

955
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,079
being celebrated with the

956
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,205
villagers, and biscuits, fried

957
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,041
chicken, apple pie-- you can't

958
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,585
really beat it.

959
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,586
>> PROBST: Adam, at this point

960
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,211
in the game, a good meal can

961
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,922
have a direct impact on the next

962
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,340
challenge.

963
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,758
>> You know, Ozzy didn't go to

964
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,301
the reward and he won the

965
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,261
challenge, so I don't know if

966
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,762
that's a good theory or not.

967
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,056
But I think it's more of going

968
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,642
to Exile Island damages you for

969
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,936
the immunity challenge more than

970
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,855
getting the reward helps you.

971
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,439
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

972
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,356
Exile Island.

973
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,274
Parvati, why Jonathan?

974
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,109
>> Sending Jonathan was a

975
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,069
strategy move to keep myself in

976
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,863
the game as long as possible.

977
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,199
I'm hoping that they'll begin to

978
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:41,782
see, you know, life is better

979
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,784
without him and keep me and

980
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,328
Adam.

981
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,204
>> PROBST: Ozzy, nice not having

982
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:47,997
Jonathan around camp for a

983
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,457
while?

984
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,625
>> Sure.

985
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,876
>> PROBST: Why?

986
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,377
>> Jonathan's got a very strong

987
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,212
personality, and sometimes it's

988
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,548
hard to be around.

989
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,591
>> PROBST: Jonathan, are you

990
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,759
learning stuff about yourself

991
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,801
that you didn't know, or have

992
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,552
you heard this kind of stuff

993
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,678
before?

994
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,055
>> Well, I mean, I am

995
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:04,639
disappointed and surprised to

996
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,432
hear that these two have had as

997
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,267
much influence on these guys and

998
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,603
that a day or two in camp, or

999
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,230
three or four, whatever, is

1000
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,773
going to throw out the trust

1001
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,441
that I put in them and the flop

1002
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,567
that I made for them.

1003
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,276
But I don't know if that's going

1004
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,027
to happen.

1005
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,196
I really hope it doesn't.

1006
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,364
>> Once again, Jeff, just like

1007
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,158
last tribal council, no one

1008
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,701
wants Jonathan around.

1009
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,911
Just the fact that there's six

1010
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,454
good people out here that really

1011
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,622
deserve to be here.

1012
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,331
>> Why don't I deserve to be

1013
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:30,539
here?

1014
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,208
>> Just your integrity.

1015
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,584
You don't have any.

1016
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,877
You flop all the time, and it's

1017
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,128
frustrating, every time we come

1018
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:36,712
to tribal council to see them

1019
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,131
over there, and he should have

1020
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:39,715
been voted out each time they

1021
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,676
were voted out.

1022
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,426
>> You know, I beg to differ,

1023
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,345
okay.

1024
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,513
All of the people that were

1025
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,472
voted off from Raro were not

1026
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,725
voted off only by me, you know.

1027
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,351
I was in a desperate situation

1028
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,395
where I had come over there, and

1029
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,604
it was their tribe mates who

1030
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,106
voted for them.

1031
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,190
>> PROBST: Do you feel a bit of

1032
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:56,816
a debt is owed to you for saving

1033
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,693
them and giving them the chance

1034
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,652
to win this game when they

1035
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,112
didn't have it?

1036
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:01,404
>> Um, yes.

1037
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,447
Some of them would not be here

1038
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,117
tonight if I hadn't flopped.

1039
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,575
That's just the truth.

1040
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,786
But the fact is I have earned

1041
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,370
my right to sit here tonight,

1042
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,706
and I believe I have earned a

1043
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,290
right to sit here at the next

1044
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:13,666
tribal council.

1045
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,127
>> PROBST: Yul, Jonathan says

1046
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,045
that he saved you guys, and yet

1047
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,088
I've heard you say that you

1048
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:19,463
saved Jonathan?

1049
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,841
Who saved who?

1050
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:22,717
>> I think we both saved each

1051
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,010
other.

1052
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:24,719
I mean, our backs were against

1053
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,928
the wall, and we had to make

1054
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,346
moves out of desperation.

1055
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,640
So I would say collectively the

1056
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,434
four of us, the Aitutaki four,

1057
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,810
are in control of the game to

1058
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:33,978
the extent I have the idol and I

1059
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:34,729
have a lot of influence within

1060
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,896
that.

1061
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,273
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1062
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,190
to the vote.

1063
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,066
Ozzy, you have the individual

1064
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,484
immunity necklace.

1065
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,318
I don't assume you're giving it

1066
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,279
up to anybody.

1067
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,697
You cannot vote for Ozzy.

1068
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,948
We also have the hidden immunity

1069
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:46,824
idol.

1070
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,491
If whoever has it needs it

1071
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,576
tonight, you'd present it to me

1072
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,870
after the vote.

1073
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,537
You would be safe, and the

1074
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,538
person with the next highest

1075
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,372
number of votes would be sent

1076
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,457
home.

1077
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,667
It is time to vote.

1078
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,754
Becky, you're up.

1079
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:13,642
>> Uh, what can I say?

1080
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,020
You're the biggest threat to me.

1081
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,272
You deserve to go home.

1082
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,286
>> (<i> whispering</i> ): You should

1083
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,162
have been voted out a long time

1084
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:33,412
ago.

1085
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,206
Hopefully we got it right this

1086
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,666
time.

1087
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,312
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1088
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:00,981
votes.

1089
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,157
Once the votes are read, the

1090
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:10,616
decision is final.

1091
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,284
The person voted out will be

1092
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,369
asked to leave the tribal

1093
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:13,911
council area immediately.

1094
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,663
I'll read the votes.

1095
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:22,878
First vote, Jonathan.

1096
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,422
Adam.

1097
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,173
One vote Adam, one vote

1098
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,551
Jonathan.

1099
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,345
Jonathan.

1100
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,179
Two votes Jonathan, one vote

Jonathan.

1103

Three votes Jonathan, one vote

1104
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,857
Adam.

1105
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:49,864

sixth member of our jury:

1107
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,117
Jonathan.

1108
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,784
That's four, that's enough,

1109
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,326
unless you have the hidden

1110
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:54,702
immunity idol.

1111
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,788
Please bring me your torch.

1112
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,090
Jonathan, the tribe has spoken.

1113
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,216
>> And I'd like my hat back at

1114
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,051
some point.

1115
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,138

thought he could trust you,

1120
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,527

1141
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:11,779
>> Is there any way you'd vote

1142
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:12,780
any of them?

1143
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,822
>> I'm going to do whatever I

1144
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,115
can to win.

1145
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,117
I don't care what that means.

1146
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,535
>> I'm scared of Ozzy.

1147
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,453
>> PROBST: And Becky and Yul

1148
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,287
consider turning on Ozzy.

1149
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:20,788
>> It's up to you.

1150
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,830
I'll leave it... whichever way

1151
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,916
you want to do it.

1152
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,880
>> These people are terrible

1153
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,924
liars-- terrible liars.

1154
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,217
I wish they'd told me to my face

1155
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,343
but they didn't do that because

1156
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:34,969
then there would be an argument

1157
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:35,719
and obviously they didn't want

1158
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,972
to hear me talk anymore.

1159
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:38,847
So now they'll have a peaceful

1160
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,182
camp and they'll have to deal

1161
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,183
with each other stabbing each

1162
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,309
other in the back as if that's

1163
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,394
some new thing in the game of

1164
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,144
<i>Survivor.</i>

1165
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,187
Four of those six people are

1166
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,230
going to join me on the jury

1167
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,315
soon enough.
