ONLY THINGS KEEPING THEM ALIVE

WERE REYNOLDS' LUCK AT FINDING

12
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,311
IDOLS.

13
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,062
>> I MIGHT AS WELL JUST KEEP

14
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,148
PLAYING THEM IF I CAN JUST KEEP

15
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:23,773

REYNOLD HASN'T MISSED YET, HE'S

19
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,112

WHY ARE THEY LIKE INTENSELY

31
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:49,299
TALKING.

32
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,803
>> SHE IS IN THE CORE SIX BUT I

YOU NEVER DO THAT IN THIS GAME.

42
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,865
>> I'M THE AUTHOR OF MY FATE.

43
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:18,077

>> I'M TIRED OF YOU TALKING --

56
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,056
>> DON'T WALK THIS WAY.

SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS

00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,318
GAME, BRANDON.

64
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,153
>> GOOD LUCK.

65
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,738
KICK THEIR ASS.

66
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,323
>> Jeff: WELL, GAME JUST GOT A

67
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,159
LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.

68
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,035
14 ARE LEFT.

69
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:12,257

>> HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED.

73
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,389
>> IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE THEM

74
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,057
STRENGTH IN THEIR OWN HEAD THAT

75
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,474
THEY'LL PULL IT OFF.

76
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,352
>> I DON'T RESPECT ONE OUNCE OF

77
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,521
WHAT HE DID.

78
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,022
WE WOULD CALL THAT A TRAITOR.

79
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,899
>> HE GAVE THEM A HOPE AND A PEP

80
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,817
TALK.

81
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,235
>> HE DID SEVERE DAMAGE TO

82
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:32,443
MYSELF.

83
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,571
>> I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT

84
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:34,779
MYSELF.

85
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,531
>> ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T MIND HIM.

86
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,074
I HAD NO IDEA HE HATED ME.

87
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,617
>> HE WAS VERY HARD, HE WAS VERY

88
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,910
CRUEL, HE WAS VERY MEAN.

89
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,328
MEAN IN WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT

90
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:42,579
ALL OF US.

91
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,790
>> IT'S FINE THAT HE HATES ME

92
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,416
AND PHILLIP, BUT HE DID IT TO

93
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:46,791
YOU, HE LIKES YOU.

94
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,127
HE SPILLED YOUR RICE AND BEANS,

95
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,294
TOO.

96
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,130
HE'S SUCH A GOOD BUY GUYS, WE'RE

97
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:52,839
ALL BAD PEOPLE.

98
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,174
YOU JUST (BLEEP)ED THE SIX

99
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,134
REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE

100
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:56,593
YOU LIKED.

101
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,052
>> HE EXAGGERATED.

102
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,429
I'M SURE THEY SIT AROUND AND SAY

103
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,889
THINGS ABOUT US AND IT'S NOT

104
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,472
LIKE WE'RE DOING THIS MEANING

105
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,348
HARM ON THIS THEM.

106
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,893
>> HE JUST WANTED TO GO DOWN

107
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:05,101
PLAYING.

108
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,603
>> I DON'T BELIEVE I EVER HAD

109
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,770
ONE CROSS WORD WITH HIM.

110
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,396
YOU NEVER SAW HIM AND I ARGUE,

111
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,356
LIKE HEY, MAN, YOU GO GET THE

112
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,441
WOOD, YOU GO DO THAT.

113
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,568
WE NEVER HAD IT.

114
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,028
IT WAS FALL THAT KID'S HEAD.

115
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:15,445
ALL OF IT.

116
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,281
I FEEL SORRY FOR BRANDON AND LET

117
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,408
ME TELL YOU, WHAT WAS GOING ON

118
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,409
WITH THAT GUY, IT TAKES A

119
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:21,743
PROFESSIONAL.

120
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,494
EVEN A SPECIALIST WOULDN'T TELL

121
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,163
YOU WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM.

122
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,372
>> I HOPE HE CAN NEVER PLAY THIS

123
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,790
GAME AGAIN BECAUSE QUITTERS

124
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,917
DON'T GET TO PLAY AGAIN.

125
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,500
HE IS OUT OF HIS MIND UP THERE

126
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,461
WITH MEL GIBSON AND ANY OTHER

127
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,754
CRAZY PERSON.

128
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,006
>> I'M SORRY YOU GOT CALLED OUT.

129
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,716
I'M SORRY YOU GOT CALLED OUT.

130
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,509
I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING .

131
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,552
>> I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE

132
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,220
SAID THAT'S NOT WHO PHILLIP IS

133
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:41,930
OUT HERE.

134
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,014
I'M PISSED ABOUT IT.

135
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:43,598
>> IT DIDN'T NEED TO GO DOWN

136
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,766
LIKE THAT.

137
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,391
>> I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE FACT

138
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,268
THAT NOBODY JUMPED IN TO SAVE

139
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,812
PHILLIP OR I.

140
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,814
JOHN HAD SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES

141
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,650
WHERE HE SAID WE LIKE THESE

142
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,567
PEOPLE, WE DON'T LIKE HIM.

143
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,694
>> IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BUT FRANKLY

144
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,695
WE'RE THE BETTER TRIBE.

145
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,988
WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS THING,

146
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,573
ONE OF US IS GOING TO WIN THIS

147
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:00,782
THING.

148
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,825
WE HAVE TO REGROUP AND LET

149
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,451
BRANDON BE WHAT HE WAS AND MOVE

150
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,285
ON.

151
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,204
>> IT FEELS GOOD THAT HE'S GONE.

152
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,413
>> ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

153
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,414
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE ON THAT.

154
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,500
ONE OF US WILL WIN THIS THING.

155
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,752
>> WHEN BRANDON WAS THERE IT WAS

156
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,545
LIKE A CERTIFIED ASYLUM.

157
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,964
IT'S COMFORTING TO KNOW BRANDON

158
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,132
WAS ABLE TO FLY OUT OF THE COO

159
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,592
COO'S NEST AND WE'RE LEFT WITH

160
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:19,842
PHILLIP.

161
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,552
>> WE'RE OUTGUNNED.

162
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:21,844
I EVALUATED.

163
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,513
WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THEM, I

164
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,430
WAS TAKING THEM ALL IN, THE MEN

165
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,140
IN PARTICULAR.

166
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,558
THEY'RE WORN, THEY'RE BEATEN.

167
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,227
WE LOOK HEALTHY.

168
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,104
WE'RE GOING TO STAY HEALTHY.

169
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:31,729
BRANDON'S GONE, I'M ALREADY DONE

170
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,397
WITH HIM.

171
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,316
>> I HAD AN OPERATION CALLED

172
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,484
OPERATION THUNDER BALL, ALL OF

173
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,569
US WAS ON BOARD WITH IT TO GO

174
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,779
AFTER CORRINE.

175
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,364
SHE'S EGO DRIVEN AND GOING TO DO

176
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,323
WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

177
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,825
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT I

178
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,576
HAVE TO TAKE A STILETTO AND GET

179
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,663
HER OUT OF THE GAME, SHE'S GONE.

180
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,671
>> WHAT'S IT SAY?

181
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,049
>> "BEATEN BY EXHAUSTION,

00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,762
WILL HAVE FUN AND CELEBRATE

184
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,013
TOGETHER."

185
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,973
>> LOSERS WILL BE DEPRESSED, GO

186
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,518
HOME TO A WET CAMP.

187
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:33,810
(LAUGHTER)

188
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,353
>> IT'S OVER FOR EDDIE AND I AS

189
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,854
FAR AS MAKING ANY KIND OF SOCIAL

190
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,731
ALLIANCES WITH ANYBODY HERE SO

191
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,483
I'M JUST GOING TO GO OUT, WIN

192
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,986
CHALLENGES, EAT RICE AND

193
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,321
HOPEFULLY SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH

194
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,116
THAT SOMETHING SHIFTS IN THE

195
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:48,324
GAME.

196
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:48,908
BECAUSE NOTHING IS SHIFTING IN

197
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:54,580
THIS CAMP.

198
00:06:54,664 --> 00:07:09,846
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

199
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,055
LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER IT

200
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,350
WAS PRETTY EMOTIONAL WITH

201
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,476
BRANDON LEAVING THE GAME.

202
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,936
MICHAEL, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

203
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,146
TRIBE DYNAMIC WHEN SOMETHING

204
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,564
LIKE THAT GOES DOWN WITH BRANDON

205
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,690
ON THE FAVORITE TRIBE.

206
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,733
HOW DOES IT HELP YOU GUYS COME

207
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,025
TOGETHER?

208
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,986
>> WELL, IT WAS GOOD YESTERDAY

209
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,779
FOR US TO FEEL SOMETHING GOOD

210
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,365
TOGETHER INSTEAD OF FEELING THE

211
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,742
RAIN AND THE HUNGER AND THE

212
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,034
DAMPNESS.

213
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,662
IT WAS GOOD TO FEEL SOMETHING

214
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,331
POSITIVE TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT

215
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:37,623
EVERYTHING.

216
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,166
>> Jeff: MATT, DID THAT DO

217
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,792
ANYTHING TO CHANGE MOMENTUM

218
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,877
WITHIN THIS GROUP OF SIX?

219
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,795
>> YEAH, WE'VE DEFINITELY BEEN

220
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,088
BUMMED OUT LOSING SO MANY

221
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:44,714
CHALLENGES AND WE ALWAYS SAY OH,

222
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,842
IT WAS SO CLOSE" AND THIS AND

223
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,134
THAT.

224
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,385
BUT THE GOOD THING IS WE WERE

225
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,845
THINKING THAT, YOU KNOW, THE

226
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,514
FAVORITES HAD ALL THIS COMFORT

227
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,391
AND FULL BELLIES AND THIS AND

228
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,559
THAT AND WE THOUGHT THEIR CAMP

229
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,186
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THIS PERFECT

230
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:58,811
LITTLE FAMILY AND THEY OBVIOUSLY

231
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,563
WERE NOT ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

232
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,523
AND I ACTUALLY FEEL BAD FOR

233
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:02,732
PHILLIP.

234
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,026
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PHILLIP

235
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,527
APPEARS TO BE CRAZY AND THIS

236
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,115
WILD GUY BUT I WOULDN'T WANT

237
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,451
ANYONE TO -- YOU KNOW, SPILLING

238
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,869
THE BEANS AND RICE, THAT'S OVER

239
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,663
THE TOP AND TRUE CRAZINESS SO I

240
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,040
ACTUALLY FEEL BAD FOR YOU GUYS.

241
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,042
>> THANK YOU.

242
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,585
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, WHAT DO YOU

243
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,961
NOTICE DIFFERENT AROUND CAMP

244
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,588
OTHER THAN BRANDON'S PHYSICAL

245
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,464
PRESENCE BEING GONE?

246
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:26,964
>> IT WAS JUST HARMONY.

247
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,174
SO RELAXING.

248
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,550
WE HAD A REGULAR NIGHT'S SLEEP.

249
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,968
IN 36 HOURS I HADN'T SLEPT.

250
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:31,677
I HAD ONE EYE OPEN ALWAYS

251
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,804
LOOKING AT BRANDON WONDERING

252
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,764
WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING TO

253
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:34,972
HAPPEN.

254
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,725
>> Jeff: SO 14 DAYS INTO THIS

255
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,893
GAME, BOTH TRIBES STILL VERY

256
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,019
GOOD ABOUT THE UNITY THAT YOU

257
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,106
HAVE RIGHT NOW.

258
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,274
GOOD, BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT TO

259
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,025
CHANGE AGAIN.

260
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,818
DROP YOUR BUFFS, WE ARE

261
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,736
SWITCHING TRIBES.

262
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,322
>> OH, MAN!

263
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,785
>> JEFF, YOU'RE KILLING ME!

264
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,163
I'M GOING TO GIVE EACH OF YOU AN

265
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,498
EGG AND ALL TOGETHER SMASH IT ON

266
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,208
YOUR CHEST, YOUR FACE, SOMEWHERE

267
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,125
ON YOUR BODY.

268
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:03,793
THE COLOR THAT COMES OUT OF THE

269
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,212
EGG WILL TELL YOU WHAT TRIBE YOU

270
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,757
WERE ON.

271
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,385
EVERYBODY READY?

272
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:18,474
THREE, TWO, ONE, SMASH.

273
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:18,891
OH!

274
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,351
>> Jeff: IF YOU WERE ORANGE,

275
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,644
TAKE A SPOT ON THE ORANGE MAT,

276
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,896
IF YOU'RE PURPLE TAKE A SPOT ON

277
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,772
THE PURPLE MAT.

278
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,773
>> HI, GUYS!

279
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:30,194
>> HI!

280
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,696

00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,454
HERE ARE YOUR BUFFS.

285
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,375

JULIA AND DAWN, YOU ARE BIG CAL.

288
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,804
PUT ON YOUR BUFFS.

289
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,556
BIKAL.

290
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,890
COCHRAN, YOU'RE A STUDENT OF THE

291
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,099
GAME.

292
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:00,891
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

293
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,603
>> THE GAME JUST STARTED ANEW.

294
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,896
>> Jeff: MATT, HOW ARE YOU

295
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,105
DOING?

296
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,231
THE GUY YOU WERE JUST TALKING

297
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,774
ABOUT FEELING SORRY FOR,

298
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,859
PHILLIP, IS NOW YOUR TRIBE MATE.

299
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,778
>> I KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY REAL

300
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,405
PSYCHED TO BE ON THIS TRIBE.

301
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,698
I ACTUALLY LIKE ALL THESE

302
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,282
PLAYERS.

303
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:16,866
WHAT CAN YOU DO, YOU KNOW?

304
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,825
LIKE MOVE ON.

305
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,244
I'M PSYCHED TO SWITCH THINGS UP

306
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:20,828
A BIT.

307
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,705
>> Jeff: CORRINE, HOW ARE YOU

308
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:22,913
FEELING?

309
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,540
YOU WERE ON THE FAVORITE TRIBE,

310
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:26,751
YOU WERE DOMINATING AND NOW

311
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,668
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT.

312
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,796
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S DEFINITELY

313
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,714
AN ADJUSTMENT.

314
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,674
I'M A LITTLE BIT --

315
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,718
>> Jeff: WERE YOU ABOUT TO SAY

316
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:35,968
INJUSTICE?

317
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,512
>> NO, I'M JUST OVERWHELMED.

318
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,348
YOU'RE SORT OF LIKE -- I'VE NOT

319
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,515
SAID BASICALLY TWO WORDS TO THE

320
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,059
OTHER TRIBE THIS WHOLE TIME SO

321
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
IT'S LIKE GETTING TO KNOW THEM.

322
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,227
MEETING NEW PEOPLE IS NICE.

323
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,188
I GET TO STAY ON MY CAMP.

324
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,858
I DON'T KNOW, I'M VERY

325
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,150
OVERWHELMED.

326
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,027
>> Jeff: BRENDA, ASSESS THESE

327
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,944
TWO NEW TRIBES.

328
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,320
>> I DON'T KNOW.

329
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,613
WE'RE STRONG.

330
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,239
I'M JUST LOOKING AT IT, IT LOOKS

331
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,324
LIKE WE HAVE A STRONG TEAM.

332
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,325
>> Jeff: SO YOU WOULD GIVE THE

333
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,576
ADVANTAGE TO YOUR TRIBE?

334
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,160
STRENGTH WISE?

335
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,037
>> IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS I

336
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,831
CAN SAY I'M PRETTY HAPPY.

337
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,832
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL GOOD

338
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,668
NEWS ON THE FOOD FRONT.

339
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,336
YOU EACH HAVE ANOTHER BAG OF

340
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,921
RICE TO REPLENISH.

341
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,713
>> WE ARE GOING TO NEED THAT.

342
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,715
>> Jeff: YOU ALSO HAVE A NEW

343
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,883
FLINT IN CASE THE ONE YOU HAVE

344
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,386
IS WEARING OUT.

345
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,763
GOTA, BIKAL, GRAB YOUR STUFF AND

346
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,848
HEAD TO YOUR NEW HOME, THIS GAME

347
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,683
JUST STARTED OVER.

348
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,810
>> I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER ABOUT

349
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,185
THIS NEW TRIBE.

350
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,646
I WAS THIS CLOSE TO BREAKING AND

351
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,481
NOW IT'S LIKE A WHOLE NEW LIFE,

352
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,816
WHOLE NEW CHANCE, WHOLE NEW

353
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,108
GAME.

354
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,193
DAY ONE FOR EDDIE AND ME NOW.

355
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:57,758
>> THANK YOU!

356
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,510
>> WELL, IT WORKED OUT WELL FOR

357
00:11:59,593 --> 00:11:59,677
US.

358
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,428
THIS IS ALL RIGHT WITH ME.

359
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,513
>> I DON'T WANT TO JINX US BUT I

360
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,139
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MOVE IN

361
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,306
ANY SCENARIO.

362
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,183
>> AS FAR AS CHALLENGES ARE

363
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:06,809
CONCERNED, I DON'T SEE THEM

364
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,477
BEATING US IN ANYTHING.

365
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,563
>> I'M PRETTY SURE WE'RE THE

366
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:10,771
GODS.

367
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,231
>> I'M ECSTATIC.

368
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:12,857
I THINK THE GOTA TRIBE IS THE

369
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,025
BEST THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE

370
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:15,651
RIGHT NOW.

371
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,236
WE ARE THE YOUNG GOOD LUCKING

372
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:17,445
TRIBE.

373
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,279
IT'S AWESOME.

374
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,906
>> GROUP HUG!

375
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,199
THEORETICALLY THE FAVORITE CANS

376
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,159
DO WHATEVER THEY WANT BECAUSE

377
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,076
THERE'S FOUR OF THEM AND THREE

378
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,453
OF THE FANS BUT I DON'T THINK

379
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,787
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A TRIBAL

380
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,456
COUNCIL FOR A LITTLE BIT SO I

381
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,373
THINK MY CHANCES OF GOING

382
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:29,832
FURTHER IN THIS GAME

383
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,127
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED.

384
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,546
AND SO THE STORY YOU GUYS DON'T

385
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,673
HAVE IS EDDIE AND I ARE THE ONES

386
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:38,924
EVEN KEEPING US IN THESE

387
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:39,550
CHALLENGES, THEY'VE BEEN TRYING

388
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,719
TO VOTE US OUT SINCE DAY TWO.

389
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,428
>> WHO HAS?

390
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,346
>> SHERRI.

391
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:44,972
SHE'S THE WORST.

392
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:45,973
SHE WAS IN LINE WITH EVERYBODY

393
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:46,849
ELSE BUT ME AND HIM.

394
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,559
>> WE ARE TOTALLY ON OUR OWN SO

395
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,143
IF YOU WANT TO VOTE HER OUT,

396
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,352
WE'RE WITH YOU.

397
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,520
>> YEAH, WE DON'T CARE.

398
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,938
>> RIGHT AWAY, AS SOON AS WE HIT

399
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,607
THE BEACH, REYNOLD AND EDDIE

400
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,733
PITCHED ME AND MALCOLM THIS IDEA

401
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,444
THAT SHERRY IS ON THE OUTSIDE

402
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,904
AND SHE'S THE PERSON WE NEED TO

403
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,780
GET OFF THE ISLAND SO THAT-TO-ME

404
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,990
THAT RAISES RED FLAGS.

405
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,075
I LOOK AT REYNOLD AND I THINK

406
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,951
USED CAR SALESMAN.

407
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,579
HE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL BABY BLUE

408
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,830
EYES TALKING THE TALK BUT IT'S

409
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,873
NOT ALL IT SEEMS.

410
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,625
>> SHERRI'S OVER THERE TRYING TO

411
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,876
MAKE A NEW ALLIANCE.

412
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,796
>> YEAH.

413
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,215
>> WHAT'S EDDIE LIKE?

414
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,174
IS HE A --

415
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,967
>> EDDIE IS A WONDERFUL GUY WHEN

416
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,886
HE'S NOT WITH REYNOLD AND HE'S

417
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,430
THE BIGGEST SALESMAN, REYNOLD.

418
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,098
>> SO IF WE LOSE WHO DO YOU WANT

419
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:28,766
TO GO?

420
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,768
>> WHO DO YOU THINK?

421
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,060
(LAUGHTER)

422
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,269
>> HE WOULDN'T TELL YOU IF HE

423
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,604
FOUND AN IDOL, RIGHT?

424
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,773
>> REYNOLD PLAYED HIS IMMUNITY

425
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,149
IDOL AT TRIBAL COUNCIL BUT I

426
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,943
THINK HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR IT

427
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:39,235
CONSTANTLY.

428
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,861
>> SHERRI SPILLED THE BEANS OF

429
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,904
THE WHOLE TRIBE TO BRENDA AND I

430
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,906
ABOUT REYNOLD AND EDDIE.

431
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,533
SHE KIND OF SPOILED EVERYTHING

432
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,450
ABOUT THEIR TRIBE WHICH IS GOOD

433
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,827
NEWS FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE STILL

434
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,995
THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF

435
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,081
FAVORITES VERSUS FANS.

436
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,583
WE OBVIOUSLY YOU APPRECIATE YOU

437
00:13:54,667 --> 00:14:03,092
TELLING US THIS INFORMATION.

438
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,101
>> HERE WE ARE!

439
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,937
>> HOME SWEET HOME.

440
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,439
>> LET'S SHOW YOU WHERE

441
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:17,773
EVERYTHING IS.

442
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,692
>> NEW TRIBE IS ME, COCHRAN,

443
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,901
DAWN AND PHILLIP FROM MY

444
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,319
PREVIOUS ALLIANCE AND THE NEW

445
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,321
PEOPLE ARE MATT, JULIA AND THEN

446
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:24,697
THERE'S MICHAEL.

447
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,700
>> HELLO PHILIPPINES.

448
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,076
>> OH, DO I HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE

449
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,911
IN MY HEART FOR A GAY TKPWA.

450
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,790
IF I WASN'T AND MORON AND HASN'T

451
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,417
PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE I'D TURN

452
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,042
ON MY ALLIANCE AND PLAY WITH THE

453
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,044
GAY BECAUSE I LIKE GAYS.

454
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,462
HOWEVER I WON'T DO THAT, NONE OF

455
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,880
MY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FLIP,

456
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,509
THAT'S FOR SURE.

457
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,927
>> WE GOT A LITTLE DOWN TIME SO

458
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,305
THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO

459
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,097
TALK TO YOU.

460
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,224
I HAD TO MAKE A BIG MOVE IN MY

461
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,684
SEASON WHERE I COMPLETELY

462
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,060
SWITCHED GEARS BECAUSE I WAS

463
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,979
READY TO BE -- YOU KNOW, A

464
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,980
DOUBLE AGENT IF I HAD TO BECAUSE

465
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,441
OBVIOUSLY I COULD JUST SIT PAT

466
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,650
AND SEE WHERE THINGS GO SENSE WE

467
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,276
HAVE THE NUMBERS OR I COULD MAKE

468
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,278
A BIG MOVE.

469
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,654
SO IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A

470
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,196
BIG MOVE WITH ME, WE HAVE TO

471
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,198
MAKE SURE YOU SURVIVE AT LEAST

472
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,575
TO THE MERGE.

473
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,704
JULIA IS A 20-YEAR-OLD VERY,

474
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,957
VERY SMART NOT COLLEGE EDUCATED

475
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,666
LIKE MYSELF.

476
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,793
BUT SHE YOUNG.

477
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:20,919
SO I WANTED TO PLANT THE SEED

478
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,338
WITH HER BECAUSE IT WOULD

479
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,005
PROBABLY BE EASIER TO GET HER

480
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,299
TRUST THAN THE TWO MEN.

481
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,468
>> CAN I ASK WHAT YOU SEE IN ME

482
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,470
THAT'S HAVING YOU GIVE ME THIS

483
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:29,678
TALK?

484
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,848
>> I TEND TO LIKE PEOPLE WHO DO

485
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,517
THINGS THAT ARE, LIKE,

486
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:35,851
EXTRAORDINARY.

487
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,936
>> I THINK PHILLIP'S BEING A

488
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,063
GREAT STRATEGIC PLAYER GIVING A

489
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,481
LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION AWAY

490
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,566
THAT COULD EITHER MAKE ME FEEL

491
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,734
REALLY COMFORTABLE AND EXCITED

492
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,402
OR SKEPTICAL AND HE KNOWS THAT

493
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,279
SO I'M HOPING TO BE ON HIS GOOD

494
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,990
PAGE BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S

495
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,616
ALWAYS NERVE-WRACKING TO GO WHEN

496
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,117
YOU HERE IN THE MINORITY.

497
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,702
>> I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME

498
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,829
TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

499
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,330
I PREFER YOU KEEP IT TO

500
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:56,580
YOURSELF.

501
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,082
>> I'LL DO MY BEST.

502
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,292
>> YOU'RE UNDER YOUR CONTROL.

503
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,210
I TOLD JULIA, PEOPLE CAN ADVANCE

504
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,837
AND MOVE AHEAD IN THIS GAME,

505
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,047
PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE DOWN IN

506
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,923
THE NUMBERS.

507
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,091
I'M THE TYPE OF GUY THAT ONCE I

508
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,884
SAY SOMETHING, I'M GOING TO DO

509
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:09,051
THAT.

510
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,594
THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS, I'M

511
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,178
NOT GOING TO ASK TWICE.

512
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,056
MOST PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE ME

513
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,141
BECAUSE OF MY PINK UNDERWEAR BUT

514
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,976
YOU'VE GOT TO BE READY TO MAKE A

515
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,394
MOVE WHEN IT COMES.

516
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,104
I LEARNED THAT FROM BEING A

517
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:27,945
FEDERAL AGENT.

518
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,533
>> THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

519
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,077
>> I KNOW.

520
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,994
IT TOOK SECONDS.

521
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,746
>> THEY KIND OF JUST SLAMMED

522
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:37,996
HER.

523
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,498
>> THERE'S COMPLETE DIVIDE

524
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,457
BETWEEN THEM.

525
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,834
SHE'S PRETTY MUCH COMING TO US

526
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,918
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY --

527
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,628
>> SHE'S NOT TIGHT WITH THOSE

528
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,838
TWO SO THEY'RE NOT TOGETHER.

529
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,715
>> SO IF WE DID WANT HER AND WE

530
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,550
HAD TO SPLIT VOTES -- HE HAD AN

531
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,218
IDOL ALREADY AND HE'S LOOKING

532
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:51,844
FOR ANOTHER ONE.

533
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,428
>> HE HAD ONE AND PLAYED IT?

534
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,888
>> BECAUSE HE WAS SO PARANOID SO

535
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,432
IF HE FINDS ANOTHER IDOL --

536
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,851
>> SO FAR YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR

537
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,476
MORE FROM A DYSFUNCTIONAL GROUP

538
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,478
OF PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN

539
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:01,729
UP WITH.

540
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,022
SHERRY DEAD SET AGAINST EDDIE

541
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:04,481
AND REYNOLD.

542
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,233
THEY ARE BOTH GUNNING FOR EACH

543
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,443
OTHER WITHIN MINUTES OF US

544
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,360
HITTING THE BEACH.

545
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,194
>> YOU DON'T HAVE AN IDOL?

546
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,572
>> NO, I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.

547
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,615
>> OH, DAMN IT.

548
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,742
>> IS THAT YOUR DREAM --

549
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,743
>> I'VE LOOKED.

550
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,746
>> ANDREA HAD A DREAM I HAD THE

551
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,747
IDOL LAST NIGHT.

552
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,123
IT'S SITTING ON MY WRIST RIGHT

553
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,249
NEXT TO HER HEAD.

554
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,168
I LOVE THIS GAME.

555
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,086
SHE'S A SMART GIRL BUT I'M AN

556
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,713
ACCOMPLISHED LIAR WHEN IT COMES

557
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,131
TO WOMEN SO MAYBE I PULLED IT

558

>> I HAD A QUIT CHAT WITH JULIA.

573
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,339
ARE YOU PLANNING TO MAKE BIG

574
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,340

EVERYTHING HAPPENS.

578
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,221
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHO TO TALK TO

579
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,180
AND WHO YOU CAN TRUST.

580
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,723
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WORK WITH

581
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:19,890

>> BUT I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT

586
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,064

589
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,151
HE'S GOT JULIA IN A CORNER

590
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,820
TELLING HER SHE'S GOT TO FLIP IF

591
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,362
SHE WANTS A CHANCE IN THE

592
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,155
ALLIANCE, SHE COULD BE SEVENTH

593
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:35,364
PLACE.

594
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,657
YOU CAN'T SAY TO PHILLIP THAT

595
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,825
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, WE DON'T

596
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,034
NEED SOMEBODY TO FLIP.

597
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:39,535
WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

598
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,286
HE'S THE WORST FEDERAL AGENT

599
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:41,620
I'VE EVER MET.

600
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,539
WHAT CASES DID HE CRACK?

601
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,665
LIKE, WHAT WAS HE WORKING ON?

602
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,125
IS THAT THE REASON OUR COUNTRY'S

603
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,376

604
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,670
LIKE, HONESTLY.

605
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,713
>> IN TRUE PHILLIP FASHION HE

606
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,090
COMES OVER TO ME AND IS LIKE I

607
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,550
HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

608
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,175
HE SAYS SO I TALKED TO JULIA

609
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,135
ABOUT FLIPPING.

610
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,095
I'M LIKE WHAT?

611
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,555

>> I'M JUST GLAD HE'S WITH US.

617
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,397
HE CAN'T BE LEFT ALONE.

618
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,606
>> I GUESS NOT.

619
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,066
DON'T THINK IT HASN'T CROSSED MY

620
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,234
HEAD TO TURN AROUND AND VOTE

621
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,360

INTO PLAY.

782
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,774
YOU'RE LOOKING TO SPELL OUT

783
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,442
"FANS VS. FAVORITES."

784
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,068
I THINK THIS IS THE ONE WE WANT

785
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,278

GOTA HAS THREE IN PLACE.

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,247
IF THEY'RE RIGHT, THAT'S A BIG

794
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:17,455

I DON'T WANT TO BE MOVING AGAIN.

>> Jeff: BIKAL APPEARS TO BE

804
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,552
ON SOME SORT OF MEDICATION

805
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,595
THEY'RE MOVING SO SLOW.

806
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,679

819
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:50,739
>> COUNTERCLOCKWISE.

820

RIGHT AND THEY NEED TO START

826
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:00,749
MOVING QUICKLY.

827
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,791
>> THIS IS WRONG, GUYS.

828

>> I THINK THIS IS LIKE THE VERY

830
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:04,628
FIRST ONE.

831
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,587
THIS SHOULD BE AT THE VERY, VERY

832
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:05,837
BOTTOM.

833
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,174
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME?

834
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,425
>> Jeff: PUT THIS ONE IN THE

835
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:10,926
DEEP FREEZE.

836
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,551
THIS IS OVER.

837
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,429

00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,644
>> GREAT JOB, GUYS.

842
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,812
>> Jeff: THAT WAS PATHETIC.

843
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,688
>> IT SURE WAS.

844
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,567
>> GREAT JOB, GUYS, GREAT JOB.

845
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,028
>> YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.

846
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:35,492
>> Jeff: GOTA, WHO WANTS IT?

847
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:35,867
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,247
(APPLAUSE)

849
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,039
GOTA, CONGRATULATIONS.

850
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:41,831
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

851
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,084
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:44,376
CAMP.

853
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:44,793
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,505
BIG WIN EARLY WITH THESE NEW

855
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:48,838
TRIBES.

856
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,633
DOMINATION BY GOTA.

857
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,009
BIKAL, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

858
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,844
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

859
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,053
CAMP.

860
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:55,470
SOMEBODY GOING HOME.

861
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:59,182
>> CORRINE IS SO INEPT EXCEPT

862
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,433
TAKING CARE OF HER BODY.

863
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,059
AS FAR AS ANYTHING ELSE GOING ON

864
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,104
IT'S JUST EMPTY.

865
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:04,729
FAVORITES MUST DOMINATE FOR NOW.

866
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,565
WHAT WE WOULD SAY BACK IN THE

867
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,234
DAY WAS THE RESPONSES OF HUMAN

868
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,610
BEINGS VARY GREATLY UNDER

869
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,070
DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES.

870
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,780
STRONG MEN ADVANCE ONLY, WEAK

871
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,157
MEN GROW AGITATED.

872
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,494
BUT SUPERIOR MEN THEY STAND

873
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,788
THEIR GROUND AND WAIT FOR BETTER

874
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:21,997
CHANCES.

875
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,665
THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO HERE.

876
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,792
I'VE JUST GOT TO WAIT FOR THE

877
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,794
PROPER MOMENT AND GIVE HER THE

878
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:32,507
BOOT.

879
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,659
>> BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO

880
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,330
SAY SOMETHING.

881
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,832
WE DID OUR BEST TODAY.

882
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,666
WE ACTUALLY DID GEL TOGETHER AS

883
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,960
A GROUP HERE IN CAMP.

884
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,338
WE'VE WORKED VERY EFFECTIVELY

885
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:11,588
TOGETHER.

886
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,172
I THINK WE ALL WENT IN THERE

887
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,882
THINKING WE COULD GO IN THERE

888
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,426
AND KICK SOME ASS BUT SOME DAYS

889
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,677
THE BETTER TEAM WINS.

890
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,845
>> PHILLIP IS THE MOST ANNOYING

891
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,972
PLAYER OUT HERE HANDS DOWN.

892
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,557
THE REASON WHY EVERYBODY KEEPS

893
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,808
THINKING HE'S THE RING LEADER IS

894
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,643
BECAUSE HE DOES OUTRAGEOUS

895
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,020
THINGS AND WE ALL JUST KEEP

896
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:27,395
QUIET ABOUT IT.

897
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,607
>> TODAY WAS THEIR DAY, YOU

898
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:30,815
KNOW?

899
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,025
THEY HAD MORE STRENGTH THAN WE

900
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:32,192
DID.

901
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:32,817
THEY CLEARLY GOT OFF TO A QUICK

902
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,235
START WITH US.

903
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,570
I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY OUT THERE

904
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,697
ON OUR SIDE NOT PUTTING IN 110%.

905
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,990
WE WERE ALL RUNNING AND

906
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:39,824
STRUTTING BUT THEY WERE MOVING

907
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,535
THOSE BOXES LIKE THEY WERE

908
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:42,869
PAPERWEIGHTS.

909
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:43,703
>> I DON'T CARE.

910
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,538
I KNOW HE'S NOT THE LEADER AND I

911
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,833
KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO

912
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,918
HIM BUT IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A

913
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,877
SPEECH, HAVE YOUR SPEECH.

914
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,296
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO ON AN

915
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,090
AIRPLANE NEXT TO A BABY ANNOYING

916
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,384
HE'S ON THE AIRPLANE NEXT TO THE

917
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,344
BABY ANNOYING AND THE BABY HAS

918
00:27:59,427 --> 00:27:59,594
DIARRHEA.

919
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,261
IT'S THE MOST ANNOYING SITUATION

920
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,221
YOU CAN BE IN.

921
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,597
>> BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO

922
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,723
HOLD OUR HEAD LOW OR LIKE

923
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,682
SOMEBODY THREW THIS.

924
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,100
NONE OF US DID THAT.

925
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,935
I DON'T PLAY THAT WAY.

926
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,812
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING BUT THERE IS

927
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,271
LITTLE I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

928
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,774
AS ANNOYING AS HE IS, HE'LL VOTE

929
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,567
WITH ME AND HE AIN'T GONNA FLIP.

930
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,819
>> WHAT I SAW TODAY IS EVERYBODY

931
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,195
OUT THERE PUSHING, EVERYBODY

932
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:17,695
STEPPED UP.

933
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,364
SO HOLD OUR HEADS HIGH, WE'LL

934
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,033
GET HIM NEXT TIME.

935
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:22,242
OKAY?

936
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:33,086
>> THANKS, PHILLIP.

937
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,255
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKINGS, FILL

938
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:35,463
TRIP?

939
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:35,755
>> HMM?

940
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,965
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

941
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,925
>> IN TERMS OF TONIGHT?

942
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:39,134
>> YUP.

943
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,511
>> I THINK A GIRL'S GOING TO GO.

944
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,721
>> THAT'S MY PLAN.

945
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,848
I WANTED TO SEE WHERE YOU WERE

946
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,515
COMING FROM.

947
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,141
I WANT TO BE HERE, DUDE, I WANT

948
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,184
TO MAKE IT TO THE MERGE, I WANT

949
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,727
TO BE A STRONG TRIBE.

950
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,895
>> WE'LL BET THEM NEXT TIME AND

951
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,730
MAKE IT TO THE MERGE.

952
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,189
>> YUP.

953
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:53,898
>> IS IT PLEAD OUR CASE TO

954
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,316
PHILLIP TIME?

955
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,860
>> I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT HE

956
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,110
THOUGHT.

957
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,070
>> I ALREADY TOLD HIM WHAT I'M

958
00:28:59,154 --> 00:28:59,362
GOING TO DO.

959
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,156
WE HAVE TO VOTE OUT THE GIRL.

960
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,657
SHE GOT FLUSTERED AND IT WAS

961
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,867
CLEAR SHE GOT FLUSTERED BECAUSE

962
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,952
WE DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT.

963
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,412
THERE'S A PRICE TO BE PAID FOR

964
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:07,620
THAT.

965
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,456
PLUS I THINK YOU GUYS ARE BETTER

966
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,040
ASSETS GOING FORWARD STRENGTH

967
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,709
VERSUS STRENGTH AGAINST THEM THE

968
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,084
NEXT CHALLENGE.

969
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,753
WE GET TO THE MERGE, WE'LL BE

970
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,130
COUNTING ON YOU BECAUSE HERE'S

971
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,965
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

972
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,759
I STILL OPERATE STEALTH "R" US,

973
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,177
IT'S UP AND RUNNING.

974
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,137
I WON'T TELL YOU WHO THE MEMBERS

975
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,013
ARE BUT IT'S A FORCE TO BE

976
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,098
RECKONED WITH IN THIS GAME.

977
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:27,348
>> YUP.

978
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,892
>> WHEN I ACTUALLY INDUCT

979
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,894
SOMEONE INTO STEALTH "R" US

980
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,437
THEY'VE GIVEN A NAME AS YOU KNOW

981
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,563
FROM WATCHING MY SEASON.

982
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,397
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE PEOPLE WITH

983
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,899
NAMES ALREADY OUT HERE.

984
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,568
SO YOUR TEST WILL BE YOU'RE

985
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,736
GOING TO PROBABLY BE TOLD BY

986
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,489
SOMEONE ELSE WITHIN MY TRIBE TO

987
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,574
DO SOMETHING.

988
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,409
UNLESS I TELL YOU DIFFERENTLY,

989
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:50,288
DO IT.

990
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,539
>> UNDERSTOOD.

991
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,249
>> SO DON'T WAIT FOR IT FROM YOU

992
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:53,374
--

993
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,292
>> IN OTHER WORDS, IF SOMEONE

994
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,001
ELSE TOLD YOU, YOU JUST

995
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,086
ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT THEY'VE SAID.

996
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,588
THERE IS TWO OF US THAT ARE

997
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,672
REALLY THE CONTROLLING FACTORS

998
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,132
AND WE DELIBERATELY SET IT UP

999
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,008
THAT WAY SO IF ONE OF US GOT OUT

1000
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,636
OF THE GAME WE COULD STILL

1001
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,261
OPERATE AS STEALTH "R" US, LIKE

1002
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,846
ANY BACKUP PLAN YOU'D HAVE.

1003
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,098
>> I WAS TRYING TO KEEP A

1004
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,975
STRAIGHT FACE, BUT HEARING

1005
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,018
PHILLIP TALK ABOUT THIS STEALTH

1006
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,478
"R" US AND ALL THIS STUFF, IT

1007
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,730
MADE ME WANT TO BUST OUT

1008
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:15,980
LAUGHING.

1009
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,690
BUT PHILLIP MAY BE A TICKET FOR

1010
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,108
ME TO GET FARTHERRER IN THIS

1011
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,194
GAME SO IF I HAVE TO KISS ASS

1012
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,571
RIGHT NOW TO PHILLIP AND BE LIKE

1013
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,532
"YES, MASTER, I'LL DO WHAT YOU

1014
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:25,740
SAY."

1015
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,283
IF THAT CAN GET KNOW THE MERGE

1016
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:27,992
AND THE NEXT PROCESS IN THIS

1017
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,496
GAME I'M GOING TO DO IT.

1018
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:31,788
ENOUGH SAID.

1019
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,413
>> AND THIS CONVERSATION WILL

1020
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,082
NOT BE REPEATED AGAIN.

1021
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:34,916
WHEN I SEE YOU'VE EXECUTED THE

1022
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,627
VERY FIRST TASK I'VE GIVEN YOU,

1023
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,629
YOU WILL THEN BECOME A MEMBER

1024
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,047
ALONG WITH THE OTHER SIX MEMBERS

1025
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,131
IN STEALTH "R" US.

1026
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,258
>> (LAUGHS)

1027
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:43,800
STEALTH "R" US.

1028
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,968
>> DO I GET A T-SHIRT.

1029
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,178
>> YOU DO, I HAVE T-SHIRTS AND

1030
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:47,470
EVERYTHING.

1031
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:47,762
ALL RIGHT.

1032
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:53,935
>> YUP, MAN.

1033
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,728
>> WHAT ARE WE SAYING TO SKWAOUL

1034
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:55,895
YA?

1035
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,981
>> I'M GOING ASK HER WHO SHE'S

1036
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:58,273
VOTING FOR.

1037
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,525
I'M GOING TO TELL HER THAT I'M

1038
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,069
PLEADING MY CASE.

1039
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:03,278
HELLO!

1040
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,738
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUY THINKING IN

1041
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,406
TERMS OF VOTING?

1042
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,031
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

1043
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,784
>> I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

1044
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:10,660
THEY'RE THINKING, DUDE AND I

1045
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,035
HAVE NO IDEA.

1046
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,871
>> MY QUESTION IS DOWN TO DO WE

1047
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,998
ALL VOTE FOR ONE?

1048
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:15,957
>> YOU KNOW, ALL OF THEM HAVE

1049
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,252
JUST BEEN LIKE, YOU KNOW, SORRY,

1050
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:19,877
SORRY, SORRY.

1051
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,087
>> THE BEST SCENARIO WOULD BE

1052
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,463
THAT THEY WANT TO VOTE FOR ONE

1053
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,131
OF THEIR PEOPLE AND THAT THEY

1054
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,258
WOULD BRING US IN AND SAY WE

1055
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,343
WANT YOUR VOTE TO GET RID OF

1056
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,511
THIS PERSON.

1057
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,388
>> WELL WHAT IF WE ALL JUST VOTE

1058
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,850
FOR COCHRAN.

1059
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,851
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT?

1060
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,518
WHO THEN?

1061
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,563
>> I WOULD ALMOST SAY DAWN.

1062
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,147
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

1063
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,690
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1064
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,358
I MEAN, WHATEVER YOU GUYS DECIDE

1065
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:42,817
IS FINE.

1066
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,652
>> I THINK WE ALL VOTE FOR DAWN.

1067
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,528
>> THAT'S FINE.

1068
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:45,987
>> OKAY.

1069
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,447
>> COOL.

1070
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,615
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

1071
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,115
I'M GLAD WE GOT TO TALK.

1072
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,618
>> RIGHT NOW JULIA THINKS THAT

1073
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,827
MICHAEL AND MYSELF ARE GOING TO

1074
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,622
WRITE DAWN'S NAME DOWN.

1075
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,457
BUT I'M DEFINITELY NOT WRITING

1076
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,083
DAWN'S NAME DOWN, I'M WRITING

1077
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,419
JULIA WITH A CAPITAL "J."

1078
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,212
AND TO BE HONEST, IT'S LIKE AS

1079
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,964
LONG AS IT AIN'T ME GOING HOME,

1080
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:14,390
THAT'S ALL I GIVE A CRAP ABOUT.

1081
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,559
>> I LOVE YOU GUYS, I THINK

1082
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,518
YOU'RE GREAT AND IF I WAS ON

1083
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,895
YOUR TRIBE FROM THE BEGINNING

1084
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,772
MORE THAN LIKELY I'D BE IN AN

1085
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,356
ALLIANCE WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

1086
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,107
HOWEVER WE DON'T KNOW.

1087
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,734
EVERYONE'S PLAYING "SURVIVOR" SO

1088
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,902
IT'S REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT.

1089
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,194
>> RIGHT.

1090
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,987
>> AND SO, LIKE, WHO ARE YOU

1091
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,113
GUYS GOING TO VOTE?

1092
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,449
>> WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY WAS,

1093
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,618
LIKE, YOU TELL ME HOW TO VOTE.

1094
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,994
THAT'S -- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1095
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:35,828
YOU TELL ME.

1096
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,997
>> OUR FEAR IS ALWAYS, LIKE, IF

1097
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,082
WE DIVULGE THE INFORMATION AND

1098
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,833
SOMEONE HAS THE IDOL WE BLOW

1099
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,125
EVERYTHING.

1100
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,294
>> WELL, I CAN TELL YOU.

1101
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,212
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE LIE TO YOUR

1102
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,630
FACE IN "SURVIVOR."

1103
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,798
I DON'T HAVE THE DAMN IDOL.

1104
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,550
IF I DID I WOULD PLAY IT TONIGHT

1105
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,176
AND NOT GIVE IT TO HIM.

1106
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,304
>> IT SEEMS RELATIVELY CLEAR TO

1107
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,931
ME THAT ONE OF THE FANS IS GOING

1108
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,266
TO GO HOME TONIGHT.

1109
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,935
I KIND OF LIKE THE IDEA OF

1110
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,061
VOTING OFF JULIA.

1111
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,187
BUT A POSSIBLE DOWN SIDE IS THAT

1112
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,898
MATT AND MICHAEL ARE OPENLY VERY

1113
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,901
CLOSE TO EACH OTHER SO LEAVING

1114
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,445
AN OUTSPOKEN DUO, A POWER COUPLE

1115
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,863
IN THIS GAME DOESN'T SEEM TO

1116
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,489
MAKE THAT MUCH STRATEGIC SENSE.

1117
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,617
>> MICHAEL AND I, WE'VE BEEN

1118
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,785
GUNG-HO ON STARTING FRESH, YOU

1119
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,744
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1120
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,329
WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED A LOT

1121
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,205
STRATEGY WISE SO I DON'T KNOW

1122
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,333
WHERE PHILLIP LIES, IF HE'S THE

1123
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,335
KINGPIN AND THIS AND THAT.

1124
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,047
>> MATT I'M PRETTY SURE HE

1125
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,675
DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL, HE REEKS

1126
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,426
OF DESPERATION.

1127
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,136
BUT IT SEEMS BETWEEN MATT AND

1128
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:33,344
JULIA.

1129
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:33,928
WHO KNOWS?

1130
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,054
IF AN IDOL IS PLAYED, MAYBE IT'S

1131
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,515
ME, MAYBE IT'S CORRINE.

1132
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,351
MAYBE IT'S PHILLIP.

1133
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,061
>> THE ORIGINAL PLAN IS GOING TO

1134
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,187
BE JULIA.

1135
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,524
THINKING ABOUT IT, MICHAEL AND

1136
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,443
MATT SEEM MUCH CLOSER TO EITHER

1137
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,527
OF THEM TO JULIA.

1138
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,195
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

1139
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,071
WHO HAS THE IDOL.

1140
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:52,822
>> MATT DOESN'T.

1141
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,449
>> NO, MATT DOESN'T.

1142
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,825
>> 100% DOES NOT.

1143
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,243
>> WE STAY IN THE GAME IF WE

1144
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:57,910
KEEP MATT.

1145
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,036
>> AND ANY BREAKUP --

1146
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,454
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1147
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,080
>> MATT'S GOT TO GO.

1148
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,958
>> WHY, BECAUSE YOU THINK HE HAS

1149
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,125
IT?

1150
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,293
>> I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM DO

1151
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,127
BUT I KNOW MATT DOESN'T.

1152
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,253
>> BY I THINK IT SHOULD BE THE

1153
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,213
GIRL BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE

1154
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,631
HAVE A CHANCE TO TURN BOTH OF

1155
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,507
THESE TWO.

1156
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,300
>> THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I WAS

1157
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:12,467
AT.

1158
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,304
>> I THINK WE CAN TURN THEM.

1159
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,264
>> TONIGHT'S VOTE IS KIND OF AS

1160
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,850
TOUP BETWEEN MATT AND JULIA.

1161
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,394
I MEAN, I WILL SAY I'M GLAD MY

1162
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,021
GAY GOT SAVED.

1163
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:25,438
GOD SAVE THE GAY.

1164
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,607
I AM UNDECIDED.

1165
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,233
I WOULD LOVE TO GET RID OF JULIA

1166
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,236
BECAUSE, A, SHE'S REALLY BORING.

1167
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,072
AND, B, LIKE, SHE REALLY IS THE

1168
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,199
ONE THAT COST US THE CHALLENGE.

1169
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,494
THE THING IS, I REALLY, REALLY

1170
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:39,744
LIKE MATT.

1171
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,579
MATT CAME TO ME, HE WAS HONEST

1172
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,456
WITH ME, DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL,

1173
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,624
I'M CONVINCE HEAD DOESN'T HAVE

1174
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,042
THE IDOL.

1175
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,668
WHY WILL I PUNISH HIM WHEN JULIA

1176
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,336
HASN'T SAID TWO WORDS TO ME?

1177
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,505
SHE DOESN'T CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING

1178
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,340
EXCEPT A NASALLY VOICE.

1179
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,134
SO I'M ABOUT GETTING RID OF HER.

1180
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,052
IT'S REALLY HARD.

1181
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,138
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

1182
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,118
Jeff: SO, MATT, WHEN YOU

1183
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:21,702
GUYS FINALLY CAME TOGETHER AND

1184
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,203
THERE ARE FANS NOW WITH

1185
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,831
FAVORITES, WHAT'S THAT LIKE FOR

1186
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,125
YOU BEING SUCH A FAN OF THE

1187
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:27,333
GAME?

1188
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,502
>> I WAS SUPER STOKED.

1189
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,546
LIKE I WAS A BIG FAN OF COCHRAN

1190
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,714
AND PHILLIP AND DAWN AND CORRINE

1191
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,174
SO IT WAS PRETTY SURREAL AND I

1192
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,425
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH THIS

1193
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,343
GROUP OF PEOPLE.

1194
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,678
>> Jeff: JULIA, THE OBVIOUS

1195
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,638
QUESTION IS FOUR FAVORITES,

1196
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,347
THREE FANS.

1197
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,849
ARE THE FANS IN TROUBLE?

1198
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,267
>> WELL, I DEFINITELY THINK THAT

1199
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,644
IT WOULD BE SILLY TO THINK THE

1200
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,270
FANS WEREN'T IN A LITTLE BIT OF

1201
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:47,520
TROUBLE.

1202
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,188
WE ARE THE MINORITY.

1203
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,314
THE FAVORITES HAVE THE NUMBERS

1204
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,191
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

1205
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:52,400
DIVIDE.

1206
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,152
>> Jeff: IS THERE A SENSE,

1207
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,153
MICHAEL, THEN THAT IT IS YOU,

1208
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,530
JULIA, OR MATT GOING HOME

1209
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:57,738
TONIGHT?

1210
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,073
>> 100%, YES.

1211
00:35:59,156 --> 00:35:59,740
ONE OF US IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1212
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,283
>> Jeff: NO QUESTION?

1213
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,244
>> NOT IN MY MIND.

1214
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,080
>> Jeff: CORRINE, HAVE THERE

1215
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:07,707
BEEN ANY BONDS MADE THAT MAKE IT

1216
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,958
HARD-- EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A

1217
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,376
GAME-- TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT?

1218
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:10,710
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1219
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,378
>> Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR FIRST

1220
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:12,837
IMPRESSION OF MICHAEL.

1221
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,589
>> YOU KNOW I ALWAYS LIKE TO

1222
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,631
PLAY WITH A GAY.

1223
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,049
I WAS THRILLED.

1224
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,217
AND THE MORE I GOT TO KNOW THE

1225
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,802
TWO OF THEM IT WAS THE SAME

1226
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,011
THING.

1227
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,304
IT WAS ACTUALLY SO OVERWHELMING

1228
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,264
FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS, LIKE, GOD

1229
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,516
THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE

1230
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,392
I'D REPLACE IN MY OWN ALLIANCE.

1231
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,227
THEY'RE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.

1232
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,104
AND I STRUGGLE WITH THE FACT

1233
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,856
THAT THIS DECISION TONIGHT ISN'T

1234
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,773
NECESSARILY A FAIR ONE.

1235
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,358
IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME.

1236
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,693
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, WHAT'S THE

1237
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,986
CURRENCY THAT HELPED YOU DECIDE

1238
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,571
WHO SHOULD WE KEEP TONIGHT

1239
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,281
BETWEEN MATT, JULIA, AND

1240
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:40,489
MICHAEL?

1241
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,240
>> THE NUMBER-ONE THING I'M

1242
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,326
GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IS ARE

1243
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,785
YOU LOYAL, ARE YOU TRUSTWORTHY

1244
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,286
AND CAN YOU DO CHALLENGES?

1245
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,455
WHEN WE GET TO THE MERGE IF I

1246
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,123
ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING CAN YOU

1247
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,708
DO WHAT I ASK YOU TO DO?

1248
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,417
>> Jeff: CORRINE, HOW DO YOU

1249
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,211
ASSES WHO TO GET RID OF?

1250
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:54,712
YOU'RE IN A GREAT SPOT.

1251
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,505
THERE ARE FOUR FAVORITES.

1252
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,423
>> I'M NOT GOING TO MINCE WORDS.

1253
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,217
I'M PARANOID ABOUT THE HIDDEN

1254
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,636
IMMUNITY IDOL AND, YEAH, SURE,

1255
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,512
IT LOOKS GOOD WHEN YOU'RE 4-3

1256
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,514
BUT IT JUST TAKES ONE IMMUNITY

1257
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,974
IDOL TO SEND ONE OF US HOME.

1258
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,308
>> TRUE.

1259
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,601
>> AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

1260
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,186
ONE OF THE THREE OF THEM HAVE

1261
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:10,603
IT.

1262
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,188
SURELY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TELL

1263
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:12,563
ME.

1264
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,272
CLEARLY THEY WANT ME TO TELL

1265
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,774
THEM WHO I'M VOTING FOR BECAUSE

1266
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,067
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO

1267
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,276
POSITION THE IDOL BUT YOU CAN'T

1268
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,569
GIVE UP ANY INFORMATION BECAUSE

1269
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,904
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

1270
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,447
>> Jeff: SO, MATT, WHAT DO YOU

1271
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,282
DO WHEN CORRINE IS BEING PRETTY

1272
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,451
HONEST AND SAYING, LISTEN, I'M

1273
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,119
WORRIED SO EITHER TELL ME THE

1274
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,454
TRUTH AND CONVINCE ME OR TELL ME

1275
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,289
A LIE AND CONVINCE ME BUT YOU'VE

1276
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,917
GOT TO CONVINCE ME.

1277
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,502
>> WELL, WE TALKED TODAY ABOUT

1278
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,671
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1279
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,421
I KNOW SHE'S BEEN WORRIED ABOUT

1280
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,382
IT AND I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

1281
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,883
I TOLD HER I DON'T HAVE IT AND I

1282
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,802
ALSO THINK SOME OF MY TRIBE

1283
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,428
MATES WOULD HAVE TOLD ME IF THEY

1284
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,304
HAD THE IDOL AND I WOULD HAVE

1285
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,390
TOLD CORRINE WHO HAD IT.

1286
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,393
>> AGAIN, THIS IS "SURVIVOR"

1287
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:50,559
101.

1288
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,894
IF I'M THEN, WE HAVE ONE SHOT TO

1289
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:52,853
TURN THIS AROUND.

1290
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,437
IF WE'VE GOT ONE IDOL BETWEEN

1291
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,398
THE THREE OF US, WE PLAY OUR

1292
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,565
CARDS RIGHT WE CAN GET SOME

1293
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,274
FOOTING HERE.

1294
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,484
AND I DO TRUST THAT HE DOESN'T

1295
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,780
HAVE IT.

1296
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,407
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THAT

1297
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:04,657
SIMPLE.

1298
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,950
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, CORPS VIN

1299
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:06,367
VERY CONCERNED.

1300
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,286
>> I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

1301
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:08,703
IDOL, TOO.

1302
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,330
THE WAY WE'LL APPROACH THIS

1303
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:11,956
DECISION IS BASED ON WHETHER OR

1304
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,916
NOT WE THINK YOU HAVE THE IDOL

1305
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,333
OR NOT.

1306
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,751
SOUF SO IF YOU HAVE IT YOU'RE

1307
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,711
GOING TO PLAY IT.

1308
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,129
IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL PROBABLY BE

1309
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:22,800
GOING HOME.

1310
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,384
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, HOW DO YOU

1311
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,928
DETERMINE WHO YOU'LL GET RID OF?

1312
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,430
IF YOU GET TO A MERGE YOU MIGHT

1313
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:27,888
NEED THOSE TWO PEOPLE.

1314
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,556
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING

1315
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,266
ON THE OTHER TRIBE.

1316
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,143
>> THAT'S THE BIG THING,

1317
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:32,393
ACTUALLY.

1318
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,602
WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP LOSING

1319
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,271
BECAUSE THE MORE WE KEEP LOSING

1320
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:35,896
THE CLOSER THEY'RE GETTING ON

1321
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,190
THE OTHER TRIBE, THEY'RE LIKE

1322
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,525
THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL

1323
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:39,734
GROUP.

1324
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,694
I DON'T SEE ME NECESSARILY

1325
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,654
PENETRATING THAT GROUP.

1326
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,530
SO THE MAIN THING IS LOYALTY AND

1327
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,490
TRUST AS PHILLIP SAID IN A MERGE

1328
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,326
SITUATION BUT IT'S NOT AN

1329
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,038
ENVIABLE CHOICE RIGHT NOW

1330
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,122
BECAUSE THERE ARE REALLY ALL

1331
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,542
GOOD OPTIONS.

1332
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,044
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1333
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,046
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1334
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:08,512
PHILLIP, YOU'RE UP.

1335
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,480
>> MY VOTE IS FOR YOU, JULIA.

1336
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,232
I HOPE IT'S YOU AND NOT ME

1337
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:27,573
TONIGHT.

1338
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,242
>> DARLING, YOU KNOW I THINK

1339
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,744
YOU'RE GREAT, I'M JUST TRYING TO

1340
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:44,632
LIVE TO SEE ONE MORE DAY.

1341
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:50,638
>> I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1342
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,431
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1343
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,059
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT

1344
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,310
TO-TO-PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE

1345
00:39:56,393 --> 00:40:03,651
TIME TO DO SO.

1346
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,736
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ

1347
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,779
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1348
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,072
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1349
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,865

1350
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,282
IMMEDIATELY.

1351
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,494
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

I GOT ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.

1403
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,787
NO ONE THOUGHT, OH, THIS GUY IS

1404
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,205
CRAZY OR TOO GNARLY BECAUSE HE

1405
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,790
HAS A BEARD AND TATTOOS.

1406
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,749

00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,795
