1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,200
I WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY TO NATALIE.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,530
Jeff: THIS IS NOT A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,230
Kris:
 I HAD THE TWO IDOLS.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,630
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE PLAYED
THEM.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,970
Jeff: FOR 35 SEASON,
"SURVIVOR" HAS CHALLENGED

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,600
PLAYERS WITH A GAME SO
COMPLICATED THAT WINNING

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,070
REQUIRES NEARLY PERFECT
EXECUTION.

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,570
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MAKING
FRIENDS.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,370
I NEED THAT ADVANTAGE.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,130
IT WORKED.

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,900
Jeff: ONE BAD DECISION CAN
HAUNT YOU FOREVER.

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,470
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,300
THESE 20 AMERICANS WILL FACE THE
SAME CHALLENGE AS THEY BEGIN

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,970
AN ADVENTURE THAT WILL FOREVER
CHANGE THEIR LIVES.

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,970
THEY WILL BE ABANDONED ON THE
ISLANDS OF FIJI AND LEFT TO FEND

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,300
FOR THEMSELVES, BUT THIS SEASON
THERE'S A TWIST.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,130
GHOST ISLAND, THE GAVE YARD FOR
BAD "SURVIVOR" DECISIONS.

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,600
AND AFTER 35 SEASON, THERE HAVE
BEEN A LOT OF THEM.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,570
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER WE'RE
BRINGING BACK THE ACTUAL IDOLS

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,500
AND ADVANTAGES THAT WERE FATALLY
MISPLAYED IN PREVIOUS SEASONS.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,930
OH, MY GOD.

22
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,730
NOT THE IDOL.

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,300
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,270
Jeff: THIS GROUP OF NEW
PLAYERS MUST FIND A WAY TO

25
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,670
REVERSE THE CURSE OF THESE
HAUNTED "SURVIVOR" RELICS OR

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,770
THEY WILL FACE THE SAME FATE.

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,770
IN THE END ONLY ONE WILL REMAIN
THE CLAIM THE MILLION DOLLAR

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,000
PRIZE.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:02:03,670
39 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE, ONE
SURVIVOR!

30
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,130
♪
 ♪

31
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,500
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,670
LET'S GET TO THIS.

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,670
"SURVIVOR" IS ONE OF THE
GREATEST SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS EVER

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,100
CREATED.

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,300
IT REQUIRES DOZENS OF CRITICAL
DECISIONS EVERY DAY.

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:26,100
IT IS A GAME SO FRAUGHT WITH
PERIL THAT ONE BAD DECISION CAN

37
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,000
HAUNT YOU FOREVER.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,530
WELCOME TO OUR 36th SEASON,
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND."

39
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,100
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THIS SEASON, FOR THE FIRST TIME

40
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,300
EVER, YOU WILL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO REVERSE THE CURSE OF SOME OF

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,730
THE WORST DECISIONS IN
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

42
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,170
WHAT?

43
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,070
MY PROBABLY BIGGEST FEAR OUT
HERE IS MAKING BAD DECISIONS,

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,700
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN IT SO MANY
TIMES THROUGHOUT "SURVIVOR."

45
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,130
THEY CAN BE SUCH A SPLIT-MOMENT
DECISION THAT CAN TAKE YOU OUT

46
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,900
OF THE GAME.

47
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,800
Jeff: AND IF YOU FIND
YOURSELF ON GHOST ISLAND, WHICH

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,630
MANY OF YOU WILL, YOU WILL BE
SURROUNDED BY REMINDERS THAT

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,270
EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME RESTS ON
YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE THE RIGHT

50
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,870
DECISION AT THE RIGHT TIME.

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,670
AND THAT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

52
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,200
OH.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,270
Jeff: WEARING THE ORANGE
BUFFS, MALOLO, YOU DON'T KNOW

54
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,370
EACH OTHER, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
MAKE YOUR FIRST BIG DECISION.

55
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,430
SELECT ONE PERSON TO REPRESENT
YOUR TRIBE.

56
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,070
ANY VOLUNTEERS?

57
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,930
Jeff: WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?

58
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,130
WE GOT OUR GUY.

59
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,000
Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,770
BRENDAN.

61
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,100
Jeff: BRENDAN, COME ON OVER
HERE NEXT TO ME.

62
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,130
AS A TEACHER AND A COACH, I'M
RELIED ON FOR A LOT OF THINGS.

63
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,700
I KNOW SOMETHING BIG IS AT AT
STAKE.

64
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,300
IF I WANT TO HELP US, I WILL DO
IT.

65
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,570
Jeff: NAVITI, PICK ONE
PERSON TO LEAD YOUR TRIBE

66
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,670
I'LL DO IT.

67
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,430
Jeff: WOW, THAT DIDN'T TAKE
ANY TIME.

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,800
CHRIS, THAT WAS INSTANT.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,230
I GUESS THEY SAW SOME GOOD
QUALITIES IN ME.

70
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,070
I'LL TAKE THE CHALLENGE.

71
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,370
Jeff: YOU GUYS WILL MAKE
YOUR FIRST BIG DECISIONS.

72
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,730
YOU'RE GOING TO DECIDE WHO RUNS
FROM YOUR TRIBE IN AN UNKNOWN

73
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,200
CHALLENGE.

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,630
WE'LL START WITH YOU, BRENDAN.

75
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,530
PICK THE PERSON YOU THINK MOST
CAPABLE OF HANDLING THE PHYSICAL

76
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,470
PART OF THE CHALLENGE.

77
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,670
I'M GOING TO TWO WITH BACK
ROW, RIGHT SIDE.

78
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,530

80
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,400
Jeff: MICHAEL, COME ON UP.

81
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,970
ALL RIGHT.

82
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,200
NOW CHOOSE SOMEBODY TO HANDLE
THE PUZZLE PART.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,430
I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE
WOMAN IN THE BECOME RIGHT.

84
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,700
Jeff: WHAT'S YOU NAME?

85
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,430
LAUREL.

86
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,430
Jeff: TAKE A SPOT NEXT TO
MICHAEL.

87
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,630
NOW WE GO TO NAVITI.

88
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,700
CHRIS, CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO
HANDLE THE PHYSICAL PORTION.

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,500

90
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,000
Jeff: DIDN'T HESITATE.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,530
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

92
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,570
SEBASTIAN.

93
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,370
Jeff: SEBASTIAN, TAKE A
SPOT RIGHT OVER HERE.

94
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,600
ALL RIGHT, CHRIS, CHOOSE
SOMEBODY TO HANDLE THE PUZZLE

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:07,830
PORTION.

96
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,900
NO.

97
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,170
Jeff: BEFORE YOU DO THIS,
WOMAN IN THE BACK WHO JUST

98
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,100
DUCKED, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

99
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,230
MORGAN.

100
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,700
Jeff: CLEARLY MORGAN YOU
ARE SAYING, NOT ME.

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,670
NOT ME.

102
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,000
Jeff: I ALREADY KNOW WHO I
WANTED, SO IT ALL WORKS OUT.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,530
WHO DO YOU WANT?

104
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,270
FRONT LEFT.

105
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,270
Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

106
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,930
DESIREE.

107
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,530
Jeff: WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
ME.

108
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,030
MAYBE I LOOK CREATIVE, BUT
PUZZLES ARE NOT MY STRONG SUIT.

109
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,600
Jeff: LET'S GET TO THE
CHALLENGE.

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.

111
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,000
THE FIRST PERSON WILL RACE
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES TO

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,870
DIG UP KEYS.

113
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,170
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE KEY, THE
PUZZLE SOLVER WILL USE THOSE

114
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,270
KEYS TO UNLOCK AND THEN SOLVE
THE PUZZLE.

115
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,970
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS.

116
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,900
NOW LET'S GET TO THE STAKES.

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,100
FIRST A BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE.

118
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:08,330
THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE
WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

119
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,500
NOT MUCH.

120
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,170
WOW.

121
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,200
Jeff: A MACHETE, A POT,
RICE, AND TAKE NOTE, MUCH LESS

122
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,670
RICE THAN ANY PREVIOUS SEASON OF
"SURVIVOR."

123
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,070
YOU WILL ALSO START WITH A VERY
EXTENSIVE FISHING KIT.

124
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:28,170
THE WINNING TRIBE WILL ALSO GO
BACK TO CAMP WITH SOMETHING

125
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,770
ELSE.

126
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,600
OH.

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,900
OH, I NEED THAT.

128
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,600
Jeff: A MASSIVE
SHELTER-BUILDING KIT.

129
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,570
THAT IS A BIG HEAD START.

130
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,930
THE LOSING TRIBE LOSES THEIR
FISHING GEAR.

131
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,600
AND HERE'S THE TWIST THAT MAKES
THIS REALLY FUN.

132
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,800
WHEN THE PUZZLE STARTS, I'M
GOING TO BEGIN A SAND TIMER.

133
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,430
IF AT ANY POINT BEFORE THE SAND
RUNS OUT EITHER ONE OF THE

134
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,230
LEADERS THINKS THEIR PUZZLE
MAKER IS NOT GOING TO WIN, YOU

135
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:03,030
CAN FORFEIT, AND BY FORFEITING,
YOU KEEP YOUR FISHING GEAR.

136
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,370
THERE IS A PENALTY FOR GIVING UP
ON YOUR TRIBE.

137
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,030
IN ADDITION TO THE
SHELTER-MAKING KIT, THE WINNING

138
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,130
TRIBE WILL START THE GAME WITH
20 EGGS AND A FLINT, WHICH MEANS

139
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:21,470
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE FIRE,
BOIL WATER, AND COOK THOSE EGGS

140
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,170
UP.

141
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,830
A LOT AT STAKE.

142
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,670
I HOPE YOU CHOSE THE RIGHT
LEADERS.

143
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,530
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

144
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:37,700
WE'LL GET STARTED.

145
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,770
ALL RIGHT.

146
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:45,130
OUR FIRST CHALLENGE, 36th
SEASON, BIG STAKES.

147
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,870
SURVIVORS READY?

148
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,530
GO!

149
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:51,800
SEBASTIAN.

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,330
GO, SEBASTIAN.

151
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,430
Jeff: BOTH GUYS WHIPPING
THROUGH THIS.

152
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,930
DIGGING UP THAT FIRST KEY.

153
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,970
SEBASTIAN HAS IT.

154
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,230
MICHAEL HAS IT.

155
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,830
WE'RE DEAD EVEN OUT OF THE GATE.

156
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,470
ANOTHER HIGH STEP.

157
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,270
BOTH GUYS HAVE THEIR FIRST KEYS
HEADING BACK.

158
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,170
MICHAEL LEAPING THROUGH THAT
HIGH STEP THIS TIME.

159
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,870
SEBASTIAN RIGHT ON HIS TAIL,
LOOKING FOR THAT SECOND KEY.

160
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,730
GO, SEBASTIAN!

161
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,600
Jeff: THIS IS WHAT YOU
DREAMED ABOUT.

162
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,570
MICHAEL HAS IT.

163
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,730
SEBASTIAN HAS HIS.

164
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,830
IT IS ALREADY BRUTALLY HOT OUT
HERE.

165
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,100
WAY TO GO, WAY TO GO, GET IT!

166
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,800
Jeff: MICHAEL STRUGGLING
NOW.

167
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,070
SEBASTIAN HEADING BACK.

168
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,600
THAT ADRENALINE STARTING TO WEAR
OFF.

169
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,230
BOTH GUYS SLOWING DOWN NOW.

170
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,000
SEBASTIAN IN THE LEAD.

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,130
MICHAEL STRUGGLING TO STAY UP.

172
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,800
SEBASTIAN DIGGING.

173
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,900
LOOKING FOR THAT THIRD KEY.

174
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,970
HE'S GOT IT.

175
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,130
HUSTLE, HUSTLE, HUSTLE!

176
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,930
Jeff: MICHAEL IS LOOKING
FOR HIS.

177
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,800
MICHAEL HAS HIS THIRD KEY.

178
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,030
KEEP IT MOVING.

179
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,430
GO, GO, GO!

180
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,030
Jeff: THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT
SURGE IS GONE.

181
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,300
THIS IS PURE WILLPOWER.

182
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,000
MICHAEL REALLY HAVING TROUBLE.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,270
GREAT JOB, GREAT JOB.

184
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,170
Jeff: GO, DESIREE.

185
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,770
LET'S GO, DESIREE.

186
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,400
Jeff: KEEP HANGING IN
THERE, MICHAEL.

187
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,930
ALMOST THERE.

188
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,400
THERE WE GO.

189
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,030
GREAT WORK, MICHAEL.

190
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,370
GOOD JOB, DESIREE.

191
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,570
Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD.

192
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,370
LAUREL WORKING TO UNLOCK HER
PUZZLE.

193
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,930
DESIREE WORKING TO UNLOCK HER
PUZZLE.

194
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,330
SHE'S GOT IT.

195
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,400
THAT TIMER STARTS NOW.

196
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
LAUREL STILL WORKING TO GET HERS
FREED.

197
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,670
SHE'S GOT IT.

198
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,500
THAT SAPPED TIMER HAS BEGUN.

199
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,970
THAT IS THE TICKING CLOCK.

200
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,930
BOTH BREN DIDN'T AND CHRIS NOW
PAYING ATTENTION TO BOTH PUZZLE

201
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,400
SOLVERS.

202
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,900
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE,
DO THEY STAY IN IT AND GO FOR

203
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,400
BROKE AND RISK LOSING THEIR
FISHING GEAR, OR AT SOME POINT

204
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,200
DO THEY PULL THE PLUG AND
SALVAGE THE FISHING GEAR BUT

205
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,130
GIVE UP THE ENDS AND FLINT?

206
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,730
I HOPE SHE KNOWS HOW TO DO
SLIDE PUZZLES.

207
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,770
YOU GOT THIS.

208
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,970
Jeff: BOTH GUYS WATCHING
BOTH PUZZLES, BECAUSE YOU HAVE

209
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,230
TO GAUGE WHAT YOUR PERSON IS
DOING IN RELATION TO WHAT THE

210
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,200
OTHER PERSON IS DOING.

211
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
DESIREE MOVING A LOT OF PIECES
QUICKLY.

212
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,870
LAUREL NOW STARTING TO GET SOME
MOMENTUM.

213
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,870
SHE'S GOT A PLAN.

214
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,030
COME ON, LAUREL.

215
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,930
COME ON, GIRL.

216
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,230
Jeff: IF AT ANY POINT
BRENDAN OR CHRIS GIVE UP ON

217
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,070
THEIR TRIBE MATE, THEY CAN PULL
THAT LEVER AND END THIS

218
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,500
CHALLENGE, AN WE'RE GETTING DOWN
TO IT RIGHT NOW.

219
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,900
NOT A LOT OF SAND LEFT IN THAT
BOTTLE.

220
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,670
THAT SAND BLOWING OUT JUST LIKE
THE TIME LEFT TO MAKE THIS

221
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,330
DECISION.

222
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,330
GO, DES.

223
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,370
Jeff: IF YOU OPT OUT, YOU
SAVE YOUR FISHING GEAR, BUT THE

224
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,770
OTHER TRIBE GETS THE SHELTER.

225
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,400
MALOLO WINS FIRST CHALLENGE.

226
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,870
HUNTING DECISION TO GIVE UP ON
DESIREE AND SAVE THE FISHING

227
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,830
GEAR.

228
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:07,000
THAT GAVE MALOLO A GIGANTIC
ADVANTAGE EARLY IN THIS SEASON.

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,070
OH, MY GOD, THAT LOOKED SO
HARD.

230
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,000
ALL RIGHT.

231
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,730
MALOLO IS GOING BACK WITH THE
SHELTER-BUILDING KIT.

232
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,700
20 EGGS AND FIRE.

233
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,830
HUGE ADVANTAGE.

234
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,930
CHRIS, WHEN IT CAME THE CRUNCH
TIME, YOU HAD A BIG DECISION.

235
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,070
DO YOU SALVAGE THE FISHING GEAR
OR GO FOR BROKE.

236
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,830
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY NO ONE WANTS
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL, BUT IT'S

237
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,870
MORE IMPORTANT TO GET WHAT WE
CAN AND IT WAS WORTH IT.

238
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,230
Jeff: ANYBODY FEELING A
LITTLE BIT, IF WE COULD DO IT

239
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:41,600
AGAIN, MAYBE WE'D MAKE A
DIFFERENT CHOICE?

240
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I'M A TRUTH-TELLER, JEFF.

241
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
I DON'T LIE.

242
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,570
Jeff: FIRST BIG DECISIONS
OUT OF THE GATE, BAD NEWS FOR

243
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,270
NAVITI.

244
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,270
GOOD NEWS FOR MALOLO.

245
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,930
MAPS TO YOUR TRIBE CAMPS.

246
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,970
HERE YOU GO.

247
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,330
HERE YOU GO.

248
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,470
THANK YOU.

249
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,300
MALOLO, HEAD ON OUT.

250
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,330
NAVITI, HEAD ON OUT.

251
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,600
GOOD LUCK ON THIS ADVENTURE.

252
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,530
THANK YOU.

253
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,570
ONE BAD DECISION CAN RUIN
YOUR GAME, AND RIGHT OUT OF THE

254
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,530
GATE CHRIS MADE THE WRONG
DECISION.

255
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,700
AND WE JUST GAVE A HUGE
ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME TO THE

256
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,300
OTHER TRIBE.

257
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,100
SO WE NEED TO PUT A STOP TO IT
QUICKLY BEFORE IT BITES US IN

258
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,330
THE BUTT.

259
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,630
ONE, TWO, THREE... MALOLO!

260
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,070
THIS IS LIKE THE BEST START
EVER.

261
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,570
YOU GET EVERYTHING.

262
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,600
LET'S GET NAMES AND LIKE
WHERE WE'RE FROM.

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,370
DO YOU GO BY MICHAEL OR MIKE?

264
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,630
EITHER ONE.

265
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,930
AT THE CHALLENGE, IT WAS SUPER
HUMBLING.

266
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:59,400
I'M ATHLETIC, BUT I'M YOUNGER.

267
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,500
I'M ACTUALLY 18 YEARS OLD.

268
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,100
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL ANYBODY MY
AGE BECAUSE I THINK IT KILLS

269
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,470
CREDIBILITY RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

270
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,370
IT'S NOT ONLY BEEN MY DREAM TO
COME OUT HERE AND PLAY, BUT I

271
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:22,270
TOTALLY FEEL LIKE I CAN WIN.

272
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:22,770
WOW.

273
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,430
THERE'S A LOT HERE.

274
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,500
I GOT ONE AND THAT'S IT.

275
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,870
MY NAME IS STEPHANIE, BUT YOU
CAN CALL ME GONZALEZ.

276
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,270
OKAY.

277
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,530
THE BUG, THE ANT, THE
SPIDERS, IT DOESN'T PHASE ME

278
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,870
BECAUSE I GREW UP IN PUERTO
RICO.

279
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,400
SO I'M IN A GOOD SPOT.

280
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,530
I DO NOT WANT TO GET IN A
FIGHT WITH YOU.

281
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,030
JUST BY LOOKING AT ME, YOU
WOULD THINK SUPER GIRLIE GIRL,

282
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,700
BUT I THINK THEY'RE NOW SAYING,
WAIT A MINUTE, THERE'S A LOT

283
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,500
MORE TO THAT GIRL, AND THEY HAVE
SEEN NOTHING YET.

284
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:55,970
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

285
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,430
KENTUCKY.

286
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,800
RIGHT AT THE WEST VIRGINIA AND
VIRGINIA, YOU KNOW HOW KENTUCKY

287
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,300
IS?

288
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,400
THAT'S WHERE I AM.

289
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,030
RIGHT THERE.

290
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,870
OKAY.

291
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,100
COOL.

292
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,230
THAT'S AWESOME.

293
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,870
I LOVE THIS EXPERIENCE BECAUSE
I'M STARTING TO MEET PEOPLE I'VE

294
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,830
NEVER GOT TO MEET BEFORE.

295
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,630
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE PLAYING
"SURVIVOR."

296
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,730
IT'S GOING TO BLOW A LOT OF
PEOPLE'S MINDS FROM EASTERN

297
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,430
KENTUCKY WHEN THEY SEE DONATHAN
HURLY IS ON "SURVIVOR."

298
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,000
ARE YOU MARRIED OR ANYTHING?

299
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,130
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

300
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,100
I'M NOT MARRIED.

301
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,330
ARE YOU DATING, MARRIED?

302
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,830
OH,, NO I CAN'T FIND A MAN IN
EASTERN KENTUCKY.

303
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,800
THERE'S NO SHAVE NOT NO GUY MEN 
EASTERN KENTUCKY THAT'S OUT LIKE

304
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,500
I AM.

305
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,330
IT'S MY FIRST TIME OUT OF THE
COUNTRY.

306
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,130
MY MAIN GOAL BESIDES WINNING THE
GAME IS TO KNOW PEOPLE THAT I

307
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,200
WOULD NEVER KNOW BEFORE, LIKE
JAMES, HE'S EXOTIC, AND LAUREL,

308
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,170
SHE STOOD OUT TO ME BECAUSE
WHERE I'M FROM IS MAINLY

309
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:49,430
CAUCASIAN.

310
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,970
I DON'T HAVE CHANCE TO HAVE AN
AFRICAN AMERICAN FRIEND.

311
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,930
I DO LIKE YOU.

312
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,670
THANK YOU.

313
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,470
I LIKE YOU.

314
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,700
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE.

315
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,170
I NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE I CAN
TRUST.

316
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,000
BECAUSE LOOKING AT ME, INOT THE
MOST BUILT OR MAYBE THE MOST

317
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,870
BRAINY.

318
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,600
IF YOU'RE TOO WEAK EARLY IN THIS
GAME, THAT'S DEFINITELY

319
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:15,030
SOMETHING THEY'RE JUST WANTING
TO GET RIGHT OUT HERE.

320
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,830
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

321
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,370
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

322
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,370
SEBASTIAN.

323
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,230
I'M A FISHERMAN.

324
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,070
YAY.

325
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,300
PERFECT!

326
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,770
I'M WENDELL, A FURNITURE
DESIGNER.

327
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,600
HI, WENDELL.

328
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,370
AS YOU KNOW, I'M CHRIS.

329
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,230
I LIVE IN THE CITY OF DREAMS,
NEW YORK CITY, BUT I GREW UP IN

330
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:31,630
THE FLORIDA KEYS.

331
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,500
I'M KELLYN.

332
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,170
BEFORE "SURVIVOR" I WAS LIVING
MY LIFE LIKE I SHOULD, DOING

333
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,300
WHAT I THOUGHT I SHOULD DO.

334
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,270
I MADE THE DECISION TO SAY,
THAT'S NOT THE LIFE I WANT.

335
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,700
SO I GOT DIVORCED.

336
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,270
I FINISHED GRAD SCHOOL.

337
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,400
AND I REALLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
START LIVING MY LIFE FOR ME.

338
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,630
AND I'M A HUGE FAN OF
"SURVIVOR."

339
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,370
I MADE IT.

340
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,530
IT'S GOING TO BE AN INSANE
JOURNEY.

341
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:56,830
I'M READY.

342
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,900
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT
SOME OF THESE.

343
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,330
SEA BASS, DO ME FAVOR.

344
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,230
DO YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU SEA
BASS?

345
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,000
I DON'T KNOW.

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,700
FOR GOD SAKE, YOU'RE A
FISHERMAN AND YOU NAME IS

347
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,970
SEBASTIAN, SEA BASS IS YOUR
NAME.

348
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,500
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF
ROOM.

349
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,770
THERE ARE TEN OF US.

350
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,670
WE NEED TO MAKE THE BEDS WIDE.

351
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,470
AS A CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR,
IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE

352
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,900
WORK COHESIVELY ON A DAILY BASIS
TO MAKE SURE THE JOB GETS DONE.

353
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,770
WHAT'S GOING ON ON YOUR
STOMACH?

354
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,600
RIGHT HERE?

355
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,930
THE SHAPES, ALL THOSE SQUARES
YOU GOT.

356
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,100
WHAT ARE THOSE?

357
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,830
SOMETHING LIKE ROCKS.

358
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,370
I DON'T KNOW.

359
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,900
I LOOK AT FOOD AND I PUT
WEIGHT ON.

360
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,570
I USED TO BE 270 POUNDS.

361
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,770
HOW DID YOU DO THAT,
LIFESTYLE CHANGE?

362
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,100
YEAH, I JUST STARTED MAKING
BETTER DECISIONS, NOT JUST IN

363
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,270
FOOD, BUT IN LIFE.

364
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,670
I'M NOT A CRIMINAL, BUT BAD
DECISIONS.

365
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,070
I LIKED TO PARTY, DRINK, GAMBLE.

366
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,930
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

367
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,830
IN MY LIFE I'VE DEFINITELY SEEN
SOME ADVERSITY AND I HAD SOME

368
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,000
STRUGGLES, BUT WHEN MY FIRST
DAUGHTER WAS BORN, THAT

369
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,730
DEFINITELY WAS A CROSSROADS FOR
ME WHERE I CAN SIT THERE AND

370
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,500
SAY, IT'S TIME FOR ME TO STEP UP
AND BECOME MAN AND TAKE CONTROL

371
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,200
OF MY LIFE.

372
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,870
SO WHAT WAS YOUR TURNING
POINT?

373
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,270
I WANTED TO BE AROUND FOR MY
KIDS.

374
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,000
THAT'S IT.

375
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,700
LEAVING MY WIFE AND THREE KIDS
BEHIND HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FROM

376
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,930
THE SECOND I LEFT THE HOUSE, BUT
MY WIFE AND KIDS GAVE ME THEIR

377
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,430
BLESSING, BUT THEY GAVE ME THEIR
BLESSING WITH THE NOTION I HAVE

378
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,230
TO BRING HOME THE BACON.

379
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,530
THEY GOT ENGAGED.

380
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,230
MY PARENTS GOT MARRIED IN KEY
WEST.

381
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,570
WE'RE MORE ALIKE THAN WE
THINK.

382
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,200
I ALREADY KNEW WE WERE ALIKE,
DUDE.

383
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,130
WHO IS MISSING?

384
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,000
CHRIS AND SEBASTIAN.

385
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
CHRIS AND SEBASTIAN ARE
MISSING.

386
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,100
NOTHING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

387
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,000
WE MEAD THE TEAM UP.

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,930
WE NEED TO GET EACH OTHER TO THE
MERGE.

389
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,330
NO, SERIOUSLY.

390
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,430
WHEN CHRIS STARTED TELLING ME
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT FLORIDA, I

391
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,500
WAS IMMEDIATELY ATTRACTED.

392
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,400
WE BOTH LOBSTER IN THE FLORIDA
KEYS AND GO TO THE BAHAMAS AND

393
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,230
BACK AND FISH.

394
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,670
IT'S LIKE BEST FRIENDS IN A
CANDY SHOP, PICKING OUT WHAT

395
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,630
KIND OF GUMMIES EACH OTHER
WANTS.

396
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,170
SO IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A BUDDY
THAT IS SO CLOSE TO YOU.

397
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:19,330
WHO ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
GUNNING FOR THE FIRST.

398
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,670
DON IS CRAZY.

399
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,870
WE NEED TO LIVE TO FIGHT
ANOTHER DAY.

400
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,430
THAT DUDE WILL BE THE ONE THAT'S
GOING TO TRY AND CUT YOU AND CUT

401
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,230
ME.

402
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,900
THERE ARE RED FLAGS WITH
DOMENICK.

403
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,470
WHEN JEFF ASKED PEOPLE, DID I
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION, THERE

404
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,370
WAS ONLY ONE PERSON THAT CAME
OUT AND SAID, NO, HE DIDN'T.

405
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,870
BACK AT IT?

406
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,070
IT GOT ME ALREADY PLAYING THE
GAME.

407
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,730
I GOT TO GET RID OF THIS GUY
BECAUSE HE'S GUNNING FOR ME.

408
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:12,530
WASHING MY FACE A LITTLE BIT.

409
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:18,070
THEY GOT WASHED INCH I PUT MY
SHOES BEHIND ME, AND THE TIDE

410
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,970
TOOK THE SHOES OUT.

411
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,430
I'M DUNN A PAIR OF SHOES.

412
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,830
THAT WAS FIRST TIME SINCE I GOT
HERE THAT I FELT STUPID.

413
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:31,070
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR
OVERALL GROUP, ME AND DONATHAN

414
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,870
DON'T STAND OUT FOR OUR
PHYSIQUES.

415
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,670
THERE IS A DECENT POSSIBILITY
THAT THE FIRST BOOT WILL

416
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,400
PROBABLY BE ONE OF US BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT BRENDAN, WE'RE NOT

417
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,170
MICHAEL.

418
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,700
I'M A LITTLE AFRAID THAT ALL
THESE PRETTY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

419
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,730
GANG UP ON ME AT SOME POINT IN
THE FUTURE IF WE DON'T WIN

420
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,130
IMMUNITY.

421
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,170
YOU GUYS THINK THERE IS AN IDOL
IN

422
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:51,700
OH, DEFINITELY.

423
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,830
IT'S NOT "SURVIVOR" WITHOUT
ONE.

424
00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:02,230
PERHAPS, PERHAPS, PERHAPS.

425
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,930
SO I'M GOING TO GO SWIM RIGHT
NOW.

426
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,230
JACOB WENT EXPLORING,
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

427
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,330
I WAS THINKING HE WOULD.

428
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,900
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE
SUSPICIOUS DUDE WHO DISAPPEARED

429
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,230
FOR 30 MINUTES HUNTING THROUGH
ALL THE FAWNA FOR AN IDOL, BUT

430
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,070
THE LAST THING I'M GOING TO BE
IN THIS GAME IS COMFORTABLE.

431
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,930
I'M SURPRISED NO ONE'S COME DOWN
YET.

432
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,570
HE'S EITHER ON THE TRAIL OF
THE IDOL OR HE'S WORKING UP TO

433
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:27,770
IT.

434
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,630
WE ALL WANT AN IDOL, BUT WE HAVE
THIS "KUMBAYA" THING WE'RE WHERE

435
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,100
-- WHERE WE'RE NOT DOING
IT.

436
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,370
HE'S THE ONE THAT'S GONE.

437
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,570
JACOB IS PLAYING THE GAME TOO
HARD OUT OF THE GATE.

438
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,970
IT'S A BAD, RISKY DECISION TO BE
THE ONE THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE AS

439
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,900
HE'S GOING OFF TO HUNT FOR AN
IDOL.

440
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,870
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE TO
STAND OUT FOR ANY REASON IN THE

441
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,900
EARLY STAGE OF THE GAME.

442
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:57,230
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO OUT
AND LOOK FOR YAMS.

443
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,870
A YAM SEARCH PARTY.

444
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,400
I'LL GET THE FIRE GOING IF YOU
WANT TO GO.

445
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,070
NO PROBLEM.

446
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,700
NO WORRIES.

447
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,130
I GOT YOU COVERED.

448
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,200
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS MY
ENTIRE LIFE.

449
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,530
YOU GOT TO REALIZE, "SURVIVOR"
AIRED THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS

450
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:15,830
FOUR.

451
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,230
AND I WATCHED EVERY SEASON SINCE
I WAS FOUR.

452
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,200
I'M EITHER ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING
REALLY STUPID OR REALLY

453
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,830
BRILLIANT.

454
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,600
IT'S LOVING THE SHOW SO MUCH
THAT MAKES ME WANT TO DO SO

455
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,100
WELL.

456
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,370
OH, THIS COULD BE REALLY STUPID.

457
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,130
SO I LITERALLY JUST POURED A
BUNCH OF RICE INTO MY DIRTY SOCK

458
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,700
HOPING THAT IT WOULD FREE UP
WHATEVER WAS INSIDE.

459
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,300
WHY NOT CHECK WHEN NO ONE ELSE
IS LOOKING.

460
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

461
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,000
I WOULD BE DEVASTATED SO
HOPEFULLY THEY THINK THAT I'M

462
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,800
NOT BEING TOO SUSPICIOUS, BUT I
THINK I ALREADY SCREWED MYSELF.

463
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:04,700
THAT WAS STUPID.

464
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,830
GUYS, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
BUILDING A MASSIVE SPIDER NET.

465
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,130
THAT'S LOOKING GOOD.

466
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,200
WHEN DID YOU START DOING
FURNITURE DESIGN?

467
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,270
MY POP STARTED ME OUT
BUILDING, BECAUSE HE HAD ME

468
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,900
DOING DRYWALL IN THE BECAME AND
STUFF LIKE THAT GROWING UP.

469
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,570
NOW I'M DOING EXACTLY WHAT I
LOVE SO MUCH.

470
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,300
WENDELL, HOW YOU MAKING OUT,
BUD?

471
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,130
STARTING THE FRAMEWORK A
LITTLE BIT.

472
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,030
SO THEY COME IN, WE PUT SOME
GOODIES IN THERE FOR THEM TO

473
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,770
EAT, THEN WE COME FIND SIX,
SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 47 CRABS IN

474
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:35,970
HERE.

475
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,000
I LIKE THE NUMBER.

476
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,230
AND WE EAT THEM.

477
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:47,530
I WENT TO U. PENN LAW, TOP-TEN
LAW SCHOOL, BUT I WASN'T WHERE I

478
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,230
WANTED TO BE.

479
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,400
I TOOK OFF THE SUIT, AND NOW I'M
A FREELANCE FURNITURE DESIGNER.

480
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,300
SO I AM MORE THAN I APPEAR.

481
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,570
THERE'S THIS GUY DOM.

482
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,670
HE'S A CONSTRUCTION WORKER, AND
I TOOK TO THAT.

483
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,470
I JUST STARTED FEELING GOOD
VIBES FROM HIM.

484
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,670
HE JUST SEEMS LIKE A FRIENDLY
GUY THAT I WOULD WORK WITH.

485
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,400
IF WE DO LOSE, WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO?

486
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,700
UNLESS SOMEONE IS JUST HORRIBLY
HORRIBLE AT THE CHALLENGE?

487
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,800
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS DOM.

488
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,630
WELL, I LIKE HIM.

489
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,600
SO JUST KEEP THINKING.

490
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,100
KEEP THIS THING MOVING AND WE'LL
FIGURE IT OUT.

491
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,670
AS SOON AS I HEARD DOMENICK'S
NAME, I WAS LIKE, MAN, LET ME

492
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,230
GIVE HIM SOME INFORMATION,
BECAUSE I THINK I CAN SHOW HIM

493
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,500
MY LOYALTY AND I THINK IT'S
GOING TO RECIPROCATE IN THE LONG

494
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,930
RUN.

495
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,800
I ASKED, ACCEPT, HEY, WHAT'S
GOING ON, AND HE'S LIKE, ISN'T

496
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,130
IT DOM.

497
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,570
THERE'S SOMEONE THAT SAID
SEBASTIAN?

498
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,000
NO ONE THINKS IT WAS CHRIS?

499
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,070
OF COURSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN.

500
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,170
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I FEEL
LIKE HE'S CURSING ME OUT IN HIS

501
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,000
BRAIN.

502
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,330
I FEEL LIKE I'M AGGRAVATING ONE
SPECIFIC PERSON, AND I BELIEVE

503
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,730
CHRIS IS THE ONE LOOKING THE
TARGET ME.

504
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,870
I KNOW IT'S CHRIS.

505
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,170
AT THIS POINT HE MAY HAVE
ALREADY PUT SOME TYPE OF

506
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,730
COALITION AGAINST ME, BUT I'M
HERE TO PLAY THE GAME, AS WELL,

507
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,230
AND HE'S GOT A BIG BATTLE AHEAD
OF HIM IF HE THINKS HE'S GOING

508
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,230
TO ROLL RIGHT IN AND JUST VOTE
ME OUT.

509
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,830
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

510
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,870
LET'S GET TO YOUR FIRST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

511
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,130
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE ACROSS A NET

512
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,630
BRIDGE.

513
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,470
YOU'RE THEN GOING TO WORK
TOGETHER TO RETRIEVE TWO BAGS OF

514
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:51,830
ROPE.

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,870
YOU WILL USE THOSE ROPES TO PULL
A SLED FILLED WITH GIANT PUZZLE

516
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,270
PIECES.

517
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,400
WITNESS YOU HAVE ALL THE PUZZLE
PIECES, YOU WILL USE THEM TO

518
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,370
SOLVE A CUBE PUZZLE.

519
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,830
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY.

520
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:14,000
THIS IS THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

521
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,670
WITH THIS IN YOUR POSSESSION,
YOU CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THE

522
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,170
GAME.

523
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,270
WITHOUT IT LOSERS GO THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE

524
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,030
THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND."

525
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,200
IN ADDITION, NAVITI, BECAUSE YOU
DO NOT HAVE FIRE, YOU ARE ALSO

526
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,170
PLAYING FOR FIRE IN THE FORM OF
FLINT.

527
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:34,530
ONE MORE THING, GHOST ISLAND IS
IN PLAY, AND SOMEBODY FROM THE

528
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,000
LOSING TRIBE WILL BE THE FIRST
TO VISIT.

529
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,870
BIG STAKES.

530
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,470
I'LL GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE.

531
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:50,800
THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD.

532
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,600
ALL RIGHT.

533
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,500
HERE WE GO.

534
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,730

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,370
EVERYBODY HITS IT HARD.

538
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,670
CHRIS GOES DOWN HARD.

539
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,930
WENDELL GOES DOWN.

540
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,670
ALL THAT ADRENALINE.

541
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,570
YEARS IN THE MAKING.

542
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,430
IT'S NOW COURSING THROUGH YOUR
BODY.

543
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,030
YOU HAVE TO GO FAST.

544
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,900
NAVITI HAS ONE BAG.

545
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,300
CHELSEA WORKING ON THE SECOND
BAG.

546
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,900
DONATHAN HAS FIRST BAG.

547
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,970
LIBBY WORKING ON THE SECOND BAG.

548
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,970
SHE'S GOT IT.

549
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:32,600
GO, MALOLO.

550
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,830
GET YOUR FIRST THREE PIECES OF
PUZZLE IN THAT SLED.

551
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,670
WE'RE GOOD, GUYS.

552
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,470
Jeff: NAVITI DOING A NICE
JOB.

553
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,270
THEY HAVE THEIR PUZZLE PIECES.

554
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,370
MALOLO STILL WORKING ON THEIR
PUZZLE PIECES.

555
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,630
NAVITI NOW WITH A LEAD.

556
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,770
DESPITE HAVING NO FOOD.

557
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,170
NO SHELTER AND NO FIRE.

558
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,030
MALOLO HAS THEIR THREE.

559
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,530
ONE, TWO, THREE!

560
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,670
Jeff: GET EVERYBODY BACK
HERE.

561
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,630
YOU'RE GOOD.

562
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,300
GO, MALOLO.

563
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,000
NAVITI NOW PULLING THAT SLED,
WHICH IS VERY HEAVY.

564
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,070
IT TAKES ALL TEN PEOPLE TO MOVE
THAT.

565
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,670
NAVITI WORKING TOGETHER REALLY
WELL.

566
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,930
MALOLO LOSES THEIR PIECES.

567
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,530
GOT TO GET THEM BACK IN.

568
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,030
MALOLO WITH A DISASTER OPENS THE
DOOR FOR NAVITI.

569
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,730
YOU'RE GOOD.

570
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,330
UNLOAD.

571
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,970
MALOLO BACK AT IT, BUT THEY'RE
STILL IN IT.

572
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,170
YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THREE PIECES
OVER THE HITCHING RAMP.

573
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,530
ONE, TWO, THREE!

574
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,100
Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD.

575
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,970
NAVITI HAS THEIR THIRD PIECE.

576
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,170
HEAD BACK.

577
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,730
PULL IT BACK.

578
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,500
Jeff: NOW YOU'VE GOT TO
PULL THAT SLED BECOME AND LOAD

579
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,170
UP THREE MORE.

580
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,630
GOT YOUR THREE PIECES.

581
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,270
GO.

582
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,800
MALOLO NOW HEADING BACK.

583
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,300
RUN, RUN.

584
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,830
LET'S RUN IT, RUN IT.

585
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,870
LET'S GO!

586
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,800
Jeff: THIS CHALLENGE IS
GOING TO EXHAUST YOU.

587
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
MALOLO TRYING THE STAY IN THIS.

588
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,730
NAVITI NOW LOADING THEIR FINAL
THREE PUZZLE PIECES.

589
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,330
YOU'RE GOOD, MALOLO.

590
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,830
NAVITI HAS THEIR FINAL THREE
PIECES.

591
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,100
YOU CAN HEAD BACK.

592
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,670
LET'S GO.

593
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,100
OH, MY GOD.

594
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,830
WE GOT THIS.

595
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:19,670
Jeff: YOU CAN SEE THE
FATIGUE SETTING IN.

596
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,270
THESE SLEDS ARE HEAVY.

597
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:28,330
IT TAKES TEAMWORK AND STRENGTH
BEYOND JUST PURE ADRENALINE.

598
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,800
MALOLO IS WORKING HARD TO GET
BACK IN THIS.

599
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,700
IF THEY CAN GET THAT SLED
MOVING.

600
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,370
NAVITI DOING A NICE JOB.

601
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,400
NOW HERE COMES MALOLO.

602
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,830
NAVITI GETTING CLOSER.

603
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,200
ONE MORE BIG PULL WILL DO IT.

604
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,570
THOSE LAST THREE PIECES, THERE
IT IS.

605
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,800
GO, YOU'RE GOOD.

606
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,000
NAVITI HAS ALL THEIR PUZZLE
PIECES.

607
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,230
NOW GET IT OVER THE HITCHING
RAIL AND START WORKING ON THE

608
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,600
PUZZLE.

609
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,300
YOU'RE GOOD.

610
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,770
FOUR PEOPLE WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.

611
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,430
LET'S GO.

612
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,870
THIS WAY, THIS WAY.

613
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,900
THIS IS THE TOP.

614
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,870
Jeff: ALMOST THERE FOR
MALOLO.

615
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,170
ONE MORE PULL WILL DO IT.

616
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,670
ONE, TWO, THREE!

617
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,700
Jeff: THERE YOU GO.

618
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,430
YOU'RE GOOD.

619
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:16,230
IT IS BRADLEY, WENDELL, DOMENICK
AND KELLYN SOLVING THE PUZZLE

620
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,500
FOR MAF AND A HALF.

621
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,600
YOU'RE GOOD, MALOLO, STARTED
WORKING ON THE PUZZLE.

622
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,000
IT IS GOING TO BE JACOB,
MICHAEL, LAUREL, AND JAMES

623
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,200
SOLVING THE PUZZLE FOR MALOLO.

624
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,100
THIS IS IT.

625
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,970
THAT IS IT.

626
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,430
Jeff: KELLYN BARKING OUT
INSTRUCTIONS TO HER GROUP.

627
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,830
MALOLO SUDDENLY'S GOT SOME
MOMENTUM NOW.

628
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,730
HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE.

629
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,870
THIS IS IT.

630
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,130
THIS IS THE BOTTOM.

631
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,530
Jeff: NAVITI NOW THINKS
THEY HAVE SOMETHING.

632
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,030
PUT IT IN THERE.

633
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,270
Jeff: AND NAVITI WITH
ANOTHER PIECE.

634
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,870
HERE COMES MALOLO NOW.

635
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,100
THIS IS YELLOW AND RED.

636
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,170
I DON'T KNOW.

637
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,800
EVERY TYPE OF DIFFERENT
COLOR.

638
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,100
GUYS, WE NEED TO DO ONE
PERSON TALKS.

639
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,430
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

640
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,130
Jeff: NAVITI THINKS THEY
HAVE ANOTHER PIECE.

641
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,700
COULD BE A BIG MOVE FOR NAVITI
IF THEY'RE RIGHT.

642
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,270
MALOLO NOW FEELING THE PANIC.

643
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,230
THIS WAY.

644
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,900
ONE MORE.

645
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,800
THIS WAY.

646
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,300
IN, IN!

647
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,070
Jeff: NAVITI LOOKS SO
CLOSE.

648
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,070
ARE THEY RIGHT?

649
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,100
WE GOT IT, JEFF.

650
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:31,770
Jeff: NAVITI WINS IMMUNITY,
SENDING MALOLO TO TRIBAL

651
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,000
COUNCIL.

652
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,600
SORRY.

653
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,630
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

654
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,700
NAVITI, DESPITE THE LACK OF
ADVANTAGE OUT OF THE GATE,

655
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,230
DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER.

656
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,500
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

657
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:49,300
NOBODY GOING HOME.

658
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,330
PLUS FIRE IN THE FORM OF FLINT.

659
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,770
WE GOT FIRE!

660
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,230
Jeff: JACOB, WITH THE BIG
ADVANTAGE, LOSING TO NAVITI,

661
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,230
WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE?

662
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,470
WE STILL KNOW WE'RE ONE OF
THE BEST TRIBES OF ALL TIME.

663
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,870
ONE LOSS DOES NOT MEAN A HISTORY
OF LOSSES.

664
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,130
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK FROM
THIS.

665
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,970
Jeff: I THINK MOST PEOPLE
WOULD PROBABLY SAY IT'S A BIT OF

666
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,770
A STATEMENT TO SAY THAT ON DAY
THREE, WE KNOW WE'RE ONE OF THE

667
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,570
GREATEST TRIBES OF ALL TIME.

668
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,670
I THINK THERE'S NEVER BEEN A
TRIBE QUITE AS COHESIVE AS US.

669
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,630
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A
DESCRIBE --.

670
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,400
Jeff: YOU'RE STICKING WITH
IT.

671
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,100
I AM.

672
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,170
GOT TO HAVE IT, OTHERWISE YOU
SHRIVEL UP AND DIE, MAN.

673
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,730
Jeff: SO, NAVITI, LET'S
MAKE THINGS A LITTLE MORE

674
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,330
INTERESTING.

675
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,570
YOU'RE GOING THE CHOOSE ONE
PERSON FROM MALOLO TO SEND TO

676
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,500
GHOST ISLAND, WHICH MEANS THEY
WILL NOT GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

677
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,400
THEY CANNOT BE VOTED VUT OF THE
GAME.

678
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,830
WOW.

679
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,830
Jeff: THIS IS A BIG
OPPORTUNITY AND A BIG DECISION.

680
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,330
HOW CAN YOU USE IT TO YOUR
ADVANTAGE?

681
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,970
JACOB WAS TALKING ALL THAT
TRASH.

682
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,800
LET'S SEND HIM.

683
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,930
OKAY.

684
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,130
Jeff: WHO IS IT GOING TO
BE?

685
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,570
WE'RE GOING TO SEND JACOB TO
GHOST ISLAND.

686
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,130
Jeff: JACOB.

687
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,400
IT'S GOOD WHEN YOU TALK BIG
SOMETIME, THEY FALL INTO YOUR

688
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,730
TRAP.

689
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,330
Jeff: SO THIS WAS ALL PART
OF A DESIGN.

690
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,330
I WANT TO SEE WHAT GHOST
ISLAND IS.

691
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,100
I WANT TO GO FIND OUT.

692
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,500
NICE TO BE IMMUNE FOR A MINUTE.

693
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,270
Jeff: SO YOU FRONTED BIG SO
THEY WOULD CHOOSE YOU TO KEEP

694
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:07,570
YOU SAFE.

695
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,930
BASICALLY, YEAH.

696
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,500
I'M NEUROTIC.

697
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,370
THIS IS HOW MY BRAIN WORKS.

698
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,700
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JACOB,
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD DOWN TO

699
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,270
THE WATER.

700
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,070
THE BOAT IS WAITING.

701
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,530
ENJOY GHOST ISLAND.

702
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,570
BYE, JACOB.

703
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,870
GOOD LUCK, Y'ALL.

704
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,900
BYE.

705
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,100
Jeff: THE BIGGEST DECISION
OF THE GAME THUS FAR.

706
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,300
NAVITI, LET'S SEE IF YOU CHOSE
WISELY.

707
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,230
NAVITI, YOU ARE SAFE.

708
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,970
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

709
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,400
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT FIRE.

710
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,330
ALL RIGHT.

711
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,200
MALOLO, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD
BACK TO CAMP.

712
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,770
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST

713
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,100
PERSON VOTED OUT OF "SURVIVOR:
GHOST ISLAND."

714
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,130
JACOB BEING ON GHOST ISLAND
DEFINITELY SCREWS US A LITTLE

715
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,170
BIT BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WE
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE VOTED OUT

716
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,200
TONIGHT.

717
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,870
NOW WE HAVE TO VOTE OUT SOMEONE
WE WEREN'T PLANNING ON.

718
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,870
STRATEGY-WISE, WHO IS IT GOING
TO BE NOW.

719
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,470
FOR THE PAST THREE DAYS MY
ENTIRE TRIBE HAS BEEN SITTING

720
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,730
AROUND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THE HECK GHOST ISLAND IS.

721
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,970
IT'S A WEIRD FEELING I AM
WALKING TRULY INTO THE UNKNOWN.

722
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,130
I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING HERE THAT'S GOING TO

723
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,300
HELP ME.

724
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,270
I TRIED TO GET HERE IN THE FIRST
PLACE, BUT I WON'T KNOW UNTIL I

725
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:42,270
FIND WHATEVER THAT THING IS.

726
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,370
IS THAT A CHINA IMMUNITY IDOL?

727
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,600
WHAT IS THAT FROM?

728
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,130
I SEE ALL OF THESE ORIGINAL
"SURVIVOR" RELICS.

729
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,330
HUH, WAIT A SECOND.

730
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,600
I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL THE
PLAYERS GOING TO THE JURY OR

731
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,970
GETTING VOTED OUT EARLY, YOU
THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE MOMENTS

732
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,370
WHERE YOU SEE GREAT PEOPLE FALL.

733
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,770
A FEW STEPS TO THE SHELTER THERE
IS A ROW OF URNS.

734
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:17,600
SMASH THE URN.

735
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,570
OH.

736
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,130
OH.

737
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:20,670
OH!

738
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,330
GAME ON.

739
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,970
FOLLOW THE FIRE.

740
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:30,000
SO I FOLLOW THE ROW OF TORCHES
UP THIS LITTLE SLOPE TO A SMALL

741
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
CLEARING WITH SOME INSTRUCTIONS
FOR A GAME.

742
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,930
GHOST ISLAND GAME OF CHANCE.

743
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:41,730
I'LL WAGER A SECRET ADVANTAGE IF
YOU'LL WAGER YOUR NEXT VOTE.

744
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,770
IF YOU WIN, YOU'LL HAVE POWER IN
THE GAME.

745
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,130
IF YOU LOSE, YOU WILL NOT VOTE
NEXT TRIBAL.

746
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,630
SO I'M LOOKING AT THE GAME, AND
THERE'S TWO BAMBOO CHUTES.

747
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,670
IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS A THIRD
ONE WITH A LOCK ON IT.

748
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:58,100
I'M GUESSING THERE IS PROBABLY A
KEY IN ONE OF THE OTHER TWO

749
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,870
BAMBOO CHUTES.

750
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,870
IF I PICK RIGHT, I'LL GET THE
ADVANTAGE.

751
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,770
IF I PICK WRONG, I GET NOTHING
AND LOSE MY VOTE.

752
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,830
OH, BOY, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT MY
TRIBE IS LOOKING AT ME AS AN

753
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,500
EASY FIRST BOOT.

754
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,930
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID
THAT, BUT IF THIS IS THE WRONG

755
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,800
DECISION, THEN LOSING MY VOTE
COULD JUST BE THE NAIL IN THE

756
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,470
COFFIN.

757
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,070
THAT'S RISKY, BUT IT FEELS LIKE
THE KIND OF RISK YOU SHOULD

758
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,470
TAKE.

759
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:27,400
I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE ONE ON
THE LEFT.

760
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,930
OKAY.

761
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,830
OH, MAN.

762
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,270
OH, MY GOD.

763
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,030
OH, MY GOD.

764
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,700
OH, MY GOD.

765
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,470
I OPEN IT UP, AND I'M FREAKING
OUT, BECAUSE I SEE "SECRET

766
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,770
ADVANTAGE."

767
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,130
THIS IS THE AUTHENTIC LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.

768
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,100
THIS IS THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE
FROM "GAME CHANGERS."

769
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,000
IT HAS THEIR NAMES ON IT.

770
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,130
I'M TOUCHING A PIECE OF
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

771
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,000
SIERRA FOUND THIS ADVANTAGE ON
GAME ONE AND KEPT IT SECRET.

772
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,770
YOU ARE GUARANTEED IMMUNITY,
BUT YOU MAY ONLY USE IT WHEN

773
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,600
THERE ARE 13 PEOPLE LEFT IN THE
GAME OR 6 LEFT IN THE GAME.

774
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
ON DAY 30 SHE TOLD SARAH.

775
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
I FOUND SOMETHING ON FIRST
DAY.

776
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,270
IT WAS A LEGACY ADVANTAGE.

777
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,900
IT WAS A COSTLY MISTAKE.

778
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:16,570
Jeff: 12th PERSON VOTED
OUT, SIERRA.

779
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,800
THIS LEGACY ADVANTAGE HAS
LOST ITS POWER, BUT YOU CAN

780
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,770
RESTORE ITS POWER BY WILLING IT
TO SOMEONE ELSE ON THE OTHER

781
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,200
TRIBE.

782
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,100
CHOOSE WISELY, AND THIS COULD BE
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ALLIANCE.

783
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,330
CHOOSE POORLY AND YOU COULD END
UP LIKE SIERRA.

784
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:35,430
SO NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO
TO GIVE THIS TO ON THE OTHER

785
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,400
SIDE, SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS
GIFT IT TO MORGAN ON THE OTHER

786
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,730
TRIBE.

787
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,400
SHE'S GOT SPUNK.

788
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,230
SHE'S GOT ENERGY.

789
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,230
I THINK SHE'S GOING TO MAKE THE
MERGE, AND I THINK IF I'M THERE

790
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,630
AT THE MERGE WITH HER, THAT WILL
BE GREAT FOR US, BECAUSE WE'LL

791
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,330
HAVE THAT CONNECTION.

792
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,300
I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT I CAN USE
THIS THING CORRECTLY, AND

793
00:36:52,300 --> 00:37:02,470
REVERSE THE CURSE.

794
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,130
I THINK WE VISUALLY NEED TO
SET THE PUZZLE UP TO WHERE WE

795
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,530
CAN SEE A LOT OF PIECES.

796
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,070
A LOT OF PIECES ARE FLIPPED
UPSIDE DOWN.

797
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,270
MAYBE FLIPPING THEM ALL TO SEE
ALL THOSE COLORS.

798
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:17,000
AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, I
WANTED PEOPLE TO GET THE COLORS

799
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,670
TOGETHER, AND GONZALEZ, WHEN SHE
COMES BACK THE CAMP, THAT WAS

800
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,730
HER BIG IDEA.

801
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,800
ME, I'M PROBABLY THE WEAKEST
PERSON ON THE TRIBE.

802
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,470
I DON'T WANT THAT TARGET ON ME,
SO I'M GOING TO TELL MY TRIBE

803
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:32,430
MATES THAT GONZALEZ SHOULD BE
THE TARGET.

804
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,300
GONZALEZ MENTIONED ABOUT THE
PUZZLE, THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING

805
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,900
TO GET OUT, WHAT SHOULD GO
TOGETHER, AND SHE JUST KIND OF

806
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,730
TOLD ME TO SHUT UP, THAT THERE
WAS TOO MANY PEOPLE TALKING.

807
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,700
PEOPLE ARE VERY UNDERESTIMATING
ME WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT I THINK

808
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,630
IN MY MIND, AND I'M USED TO
THAT, BUT I HAVE MY OWN

809
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,200
THOUGHTS, AND MY OWN PLANS, AND
HOPEFULLY IT WORKS IN MY FAVOR

810
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,970
TONIGHT.

811
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,230
WHO DO WE FEEL LIKE IS ONE OF
THE WEAKER PLAYERS?

812
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,500
I THINK IT'S GOING TO COME
DOWN TO SIZE.

813
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:08,200
I MEAN, DONATHAN DID NOT PULL
BACK THERE.

814
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,500
WE NEED TO HAVE A STRONG
TRIBE?

815
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,430
WHO IS WEAK?

816
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,400
WHO DIDN'T PERFORM TO THEIR
BEST?

817
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:14,670
DONATHAN.

818
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,500
DONATHAN.

819
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,130
JUST VISUALLY.

820
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,130
IT KIND OF CRUSHES YOU IN A
SENSE BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE A

821
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,000
GREAT HEART, BUT AS MUCH AS I
DON'T WANT THE GET RID OF THE

822
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,270
GUY, IF SOMEBODY HAS TO GO, THEN
HE'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE

823
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,230
OPTIONS TO GO.

824
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:38,830
BETWEEN DONATHAN AND
GONZALEZ?

825
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:42,500
WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF
EACH OF THEM?

826
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,270
BEING A SUPER FAN OF THE SHOW, I
KNOW THE FIRST VOTE SETS THE

827
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,370
TONE FOR THE ENTIRE GAME.

828
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,630
DONATHAN WILL BE SOMEBODY
THAT WE CAN USE AS A VOTE.

829
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,100
I THINK SHE WILL --
 SHE WILL DO ANYTHING.

830
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,170
BUT THEN DONATHAN IS WEAKER.

831
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,130
IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE
DONATHAN OR GONZALEZ.

832
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,500
I THINK THAT DONATHAN IS
PROBABLY OUR WEAKEST LENGTH, BUT

833
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,000
I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A LEVEL OF
CONTROL THAT I HAVE.

834
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,930
HE'S GOING TO VOTE WITH US.

835
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,200
HE'S SOMEBODY THAT I CAN
NURTURE.

836
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,630
ONE OF THOSE TWO, THAT'S GREAT.

837
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,970
TO ME GETTING RID OF GONE IS
ABOUT GETTING RID OF A STRATEGIC

838
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:17,000
THREAT, BECAUSE HE'S GOT HER OWN
AGENDA, AND SHE'S WAY TOO

839
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,300
STRONG.

840
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,830
DONATHAN OR GONZALEZ?

841
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,200
I MEAN, I THINK SHE'S GOING
TO BE A HUGE THREAT.

842
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,500
I DO, TOO.

843
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,030
BUT THEN AGAIN SHE'S A REALLY
STRONG PLAYER, AND I FEEL

844
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,670
LIKE --
 SHE IS, BUT IS SHE?

845
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,200
YEAH.

846
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,030
LIKE I FEEL LIKE DONATHAN
WORKS HARDER THAN HER.

847
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,130
HE DEFINITELY WORKS HARDER.

848
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,700
HE WORKS HARDER THAN HER AND
HE MIGHT BE GOOD IF WE NEED A

849
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,530
LITTLE PERSON TO SHOVE INTO
SOMETHING.

850
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,570
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

851
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,800
BUT THE THING IS, I'M
THINKING DONATHAN JUST TO KEEP

852
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,870
THINGS STRONG.

853
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,530
FOR ME PERSONALLY TONIGHT, I'M
BASING MY VOTE OFF OF STRENGTH.

854
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,770
YOU KNOW, THAT'S TO ME THE MOST
INTELLIGENT THING TO DO AT A

855
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,700
FIRST VOTE, BECAUSE WE ALL WANT
TO WIN.

856
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,700
WE WANT TO GET THE NEXT
CHALLENGES UNDER OUR BELT AND

857
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,530
MAKE IT THAT MUCH FURTHER AND
NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL OF

858
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,430
THIS SO EARLY.

859
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,930
AND I THINK THAT GONZALEZ IS
SOMEBODY WE CAN EASILY DO WAY

860
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:09,830
DOWN THE LINE, BUT FIRST VOTE IS
HUGE BECAUSE IT COULD AFFECT OUR

861
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,570
ENTIRE GAME.

862
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,630
WITH THIS BEING GHOST ISLAND, I
FEEL LIKE IT'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY.

863
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,970
IF YOU MAKE A BAD DECISION, I
THINK THAT WILL HAUNT ME FOR

864
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:17,970
LIFE.

865
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,070
Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.

866
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:58,130
GRAB A TORCH, APPROACH A FLAME,
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

867
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,470
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNSEL, BECAUSE IN THIS

868
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,230
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

869
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,230
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

870
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,200
STEPHANIE, I GOT TO ASK, YOU'RE
SMILING.

871
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,570
I CAN'T HELP IT.

872
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,030
LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST WANT
THE TAKE EVERYTHING IN, BUT AT

873
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,870
THE SAME TIME, THE GAME GETTING
STARTED RIGHT NOW.

874
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,400
Jeff: WELL, LET'S GET INTO
IT.

875
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,230
GONZALEZ, WHAT'S THE TAKE ON
GHOST ISLAND?

876
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,300
IS IT EXCITING THAT THERE'S A
PART OF THE GAME THAT YOU DON'T

877
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,300
YET UNDERSTAND?

878
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,800
IT IS EXCITING.

879
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,970
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.

880
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,330
MAYBE JACOB WILL COME BACK AND
TELL US HOW MISERABLE HE WAS,

881
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,900
BUT SOMETHING TELLS US HE'S
LOOKING FOR IDOLS, JUST BECAUSE

882
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,930
JACOB IS KIND OF SPECIAL.

883
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,430
Jeff: DO YOU KNOW WHAT
GONZALEZ IS TALKING ABOUT WHEN

884
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,870
SHE SAYS JACOB IS A LITTLE
SPECIAL?

885
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,200
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE THAT
HE WILL LEAVE FOR THREE HOURS

886
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,030
AND AUTOMATICALLY HAVE A TARGET
ON HIS BAKE.

887
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,830
IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S MAKING A FEW
MISTAKES, AND THAT MIGHT BE WHAT

888
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,370
SHE'S REFERRING TO.

889
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,830
Jeff: LAUREL, WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU GOT BACK THE CAMP.

890
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:03,500
IT SOUNDS LIKE JACOB WAS AN EASY
VOTE AND NOW YOU DON'T HAVE AN

891
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:03,930
EASY VOTE.

892
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:09,100
I THINK WE WANT TO KEEP THE
TRIBE STRONG.

893
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,570
THAT'S A QUESTION OF WHAT THAT
MEANS.

894
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,270
DO YOU WANT TO KEEP THE TRIBE
PHYSICALLY STRONG?

895
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,300
Jeff: WHERE DID YOU FALL?

896
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,100
I WANT TO KEEP THE TRIBE
PHYSICALLY STRONG.

897
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,370
I THINK WE STRUGGLED IN THE
OBSTACLE.

898
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:25,030
Jeff: DONATHAN, AS ONE OF
THE SMALLER GUY, DO YOU THINK,

899
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,170
PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT ME.

900
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,400
I'M DEFINITELY NOT THE MOST
PHYSICAL.

901
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,900
YOU SEE ALL THESE BUFF GUYS
PULLING THE WEIGHT.

902
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,230
I'M DEFINITELY NERVOUS TONIGHT.

903
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,630
Jeff: STEPHANIE, DOES THAT
MAKE SENSE TO YOU THAT DONATHAN

904
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,030
MIGHT FEEL HEAT?

905
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,230
IF IT'S BASED PURELY ON
PHYSICAL STRENGTH.

906
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,400
THERE'S STRATEGIC STRENGTH.

907
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,930
THERE'S SOCIAL STRENGTH.

908
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,900
SO WHAT IS THE CRITERIA FOR
TONIGHT.

909
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,600
Jeff: THAT WAS AN
INTERESTING ANSWER.

910
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,870
DONATHAN, DO YOU THINK THE
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE

911
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,370
ALREADY FORMED OR STILL MAY BE
FORMING WILL IMPACT TONIGHT'S

912
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:57,630
VOTE?

913
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,930
YEAH, THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE
SO FAST HAS BEEN ABOUT BUILDING

914
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,130
RELATIONSHIPS FOR ME AT LEAST.

915
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,500
I'M FROM EASTERN KENTUCKY.

916
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,730
I DON'T GET TO SEE VERY MANY
DIVERSE AND DIFFERENT

917
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,170
BACKGROUNDS.

918
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,570
YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST A BUNCH
OF EXPERIENCES THEY'VE HAD AND I

919
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,000
HAVEN'T HAD TO HAVE ANY REALLY
BIG EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE, SO

920
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,970
IT COULD DEFINITELY PUT ME AT A
DISADVANTAGE.

921
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:24,130
Jeff: GONZALEZ, YOU WERE
VERY INVOLVED IN THE

922
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:24,930
PUZZLE-MAKING PART OF THE
CHALLENGE.

923
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,700
I WANTED TO BE IN THERE SO
BAD.

924
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,730
I CAN LOOK AT THINGS AND PUT
THEM TOGETHER IN MY BRAIN AND

925
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,200
JUST DO IT.

926
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,200
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE SECOND NATURE
TO ME, SO I'M PRETTY STRONG AT

927
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:34,500
PUZZLES.

928
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,570
Jeff: AND YET, BRENDAN, SHE
WASN'T CHOSEN FOR THE PUZZLE.

929
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,900
WELL, I MEAN, PART OF IT IS
WE'RE THREE DAY IN.

930
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,900
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER'S
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.

931
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,370
IF WE KNEW ABOUT GONZALEZ WHAT
SHE JUST SAID,'D BE ALL FOR HER

932
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,200
GETTING IN THERE.

933
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,630
Jeff: JENNA, OUT OF THE
GATE, DID YOU FIND GROUPS OF

934
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,070
PEOPLE MAYBE STARTING TO FORM
WHAT MIGHT BE AN ALLIANCE?

935
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,300
IT'S SO EARLY.

936
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:02,900
TODAY WAS THE FIRST DAY ANYONE
DID START SPHRAT JIEZING.

937
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,300
IT WAS BIGGER GROUPS.

938
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,570
YOU JUST WANTED TO BE PART OF
THE MAIN CONVERSATION.

939
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,770
Jeff: AT SOME POINT YOU
HAVE TO TRUST SOMEBODY,

940
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:09,930
OTHERWISE YOU HAVE NOTHING.

941
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:10,870
TOTALLY.

942
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:11,600
I AGREE.

943
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,200
BUT ALLIANCES HAVEN'T BEEN
FORMED AND LOYALTY HASN'T BEEN

944
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,700
PROVEN BECAUSE THIS IS OUR FIRST
VOTE.

945
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,900
I THINK IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO
THE CONVERSATIONS WHO WAS THERE

946
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,600
AT THAT TIME.

947
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,730
AND IF YOU WEREN'T THERE, THEN
YOU KNOW YOU COULD JUST AS

948
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:27,630
EASILY BE WITH -- THE ONE OUT
TONIGHT.

949
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,330
Jennifer: GONZALEZ, YOU'VE
SHIFTED YOUR WHOLE REACTION TO

950
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,000
LOOK AT MICHAEL.

951
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,900
IT'S SCARY YOU CAN MISS OUR
ON ONE CONVERSATION AND THE

952
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,500
TARGET IS ON YOUR BACK.

953
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,200
Jeff: HAVE I MISSED
ANYTHING?

954
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,770
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING THEY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

955
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:44,570
YEAH.

956
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:49,270
JUST MAKING SURE WE'RE STILL
SOLID.

957
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,570
Jeff: DO YOUR THING.

958
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:56,330
IT'S YOUR TRIBAL.

959
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,330
WOW.

960
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,730
STEPHANIE, FIRST TRIBAL.

961
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,170
THROWING IT DOWN.

962
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,230
THIS GOING TO BE A CRAZY SEASON.

963
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:08,400
Jeff: IS THIS MAKING YOU
NERVOUS RIGHT NOW?

964
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,230
NO.

965
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,670
LAUREL IS CERTAINLY CURIOUS.

966
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,830
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING.

967
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,370
Amaka: JENNA, ARE YOU
WORRIED IT DOESN'T INCLUDE YOU?

968
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,030
YEAH, IT DESTROYS THE UNITED
FRONT WE THOUGHT WE HAD.

969
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:25,470
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

970
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,930
Jeff: DONATHAN, NOBODY
TALKING TO YOU.

971
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:28,630
NO.

972
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,500
Jeff: YOU ARE LEANING AWAY
FROM TALKING.

973
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,730
WHEN YOU GET NERVOUS, YOU GOT
TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT.

974
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:40,670
OKAY.

975
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,870
Jeff: BRENDAN, GAME IS ON.

976
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,900
THAT'S WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR.

977
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,800
WE'RE READY.

978
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,970
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

979
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:46,930
LET'S SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT.

980
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,600
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

981
00:45:48,600 --> 00:46:05,100
JAMES, YOU'RE UP.

982
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:35,830
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

983
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,830
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

984
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,230
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

985
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:42,730
OKAY.

986
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,770
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

987
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,430
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

988
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,730
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

989
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,470
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

990
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,770
FIRST VOTE DONATHAN.

991
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,570
GONZALEZ.

992
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,070
GONZALEZ.

993
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:05,830
THAT'S TWO VOTES GONZALEZ.

994
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,170
GONZALEZ.

995
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,730
THAT'S THREE VOTES GONZALEZ.

996
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:14,270
ONE VOTE DONATHAN.

997
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,130
FOUR VOTES GONZALEZ.

998
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,170
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND,"

999
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:20,630
GONZALEZ.

1000
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,330
THAT'S FIVE.

1001
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,000
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1002
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:32,300
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1003
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,370
GONZALEZ, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1004
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,170
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1005
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:46,100
SAD.

1006
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,630
Jeff: WELL, YOU'VE ALREADY
BEEN FORCED TO MAKE A LOT OF BIG

1007
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,670
DECISION, INCLUDING VOTING OUT
YOUR FIRST TRIBE MEMBER.

1008
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,770
STILL A LOT OF DECISIONS LEFT TO
COME.

1009
00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:25,400
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, GOOD NIGHT.

1010
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,800
FORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO
GO THE TRIBAL TONIGHT.

1011
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,030
I TOLD MYSELF WHEN I CAME INTO
THIS GAME, I'M GOING TO HAVE A

1012
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,400
HANDLE ON MY PAIR NOWBACK BUT
I'M JUST STARTING TO GET A BAD

1013
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,330
FEELING AROUND HERE ABOUT NOT
FITTING IN.

1014
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,430
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S GOING
ON, BUT I NEED THE MAKE A MOVE

1015
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:43,770
NOW.

1016
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:45,700
COMING OUT THE LOOK FOR IDOLS
DURING THE DAY HAS NOT BEEN

1017
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,200
WORKING OUT, SO I DON'T CARE
WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS, I'LL

1018
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,800
LOOK.

1019
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,630
IT'S TOO DARK.

1020
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,570
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

1021
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,370
SO AS LONG AS I'M IN THIS GAME,
I'LL BE LOOKING.

1022
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,700
I'M HERE THE PLAY.

1023
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:08,570
WE'LL SLEEP WHEN WE'RE DEAD.

1024
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,730
OH, MY GOD.

1025
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:14,770
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FOUND THE
IMMUNITY IDOL IN THE DARK.

1026
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,800
OH, MY GOD.

1027
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,170
I KNOW FOR ME PERSONALLY WITH AN
IDOL I CAN TAKE WAY BIGGER

1028
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:21,470
RISKS.

1029
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,630
I WANT THE TAKE RISKS.

1030
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,730
I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME REALLY
HARD.

1031
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,630
I JUST CAN'T READ IT RIGHT NOW.

1032
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:34,770
I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT GETS
BRIGHTER.

1033
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,030
OH, IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS.

1034
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,770
I FINALLY GET THE READ THIS
THING.

1035
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,600
I'VE BEEN WAITING.

1036
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,430
"THIS IS THE AUTHENTIC HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL THAT ANDREA WAS

1037
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,070
VOTED OUT WITH IN "SURVIVOR'S"
26th SEASON."

1038
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:49,900
YOU GOT IT.

1039
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,000
NO WAY!

1040
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,970
ON DAY 33 ANDREA HAD A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND WHAT SHE

1041
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:02,200
THOUGHT WAS A TRUSTWORTHY
ALLIANCE, BUT SHE WAS WRONG.

1042
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,500
OH, YOU GUYS.

1043
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,230
ANDREA BECAME THE FIRST
FEMALE TO BE VOTED OUT WITH AN

1044
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,370
IDOL IN HER POCKETS.

1045
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,800
THIS TAINTED HOUR HAS BEEN
HAUNTED FOR FIVE YEARS BUT STILL

1046
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,930
RETAINS ITS ORIGINAL POWER.

1047
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,800
CAN YOU REVERSE THE CURSE?

1048
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,230
I'M STARTING TO GET A HANDLE ON
THE ESSENCE OF GHOST ISLAND.

1049
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,770
IT'S ALL ABOUT PAST PLAYERS'
MISTAKES.

1050
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,700
ANDREA KEPT THIS IN HER POCKET,
AND IT WAS A HUGE BLUNDER ON HER

1051
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:27,970
PART.

1052
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:30,230
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF THE CURSE
GETTING ME.

1053
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:37,970
LY REVERSE IT FOR SURE.

1054
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:44,800
I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
IS MY GUESS IS THERE'S IDOLS TO

1055
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,170
BE HAD AT GHOST ISLAND.

1056
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,800
YOUR GUESS, BUT WE DON'T
KNOW.

1057
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,700
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHO WE
SEND.

1058
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,530
THIS GHOST ISLAND THROWS A
WRENCH IN THINGS, BECAUSE WHO

1059
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,870
YOU SEND IS GOING TO IMPACT THE
GAME.

1060
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,700
WE THOUGHT SEND THEIR WEAK
PLAYER TO GHOST ISLAND WHERE YOU

1061
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,170
KNOW THEY'RE SAFE AND LEAVE THE
STRONGER PEOPLE THERE TO GET

1062
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,370
VOTED OFF.

1063
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:08,630
BUT IT SEEMS FOR ME THAT WAS A
REALLY GOOD MOVE, BECAUSE THIS

1064
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:14,730
MORNING I LOOKED IN MY BAG AND I
FOUND THE MOST AMAZING,

1065
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:17,000
UNEXPECTED SURPRISE.

1066
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,500
THIS IS THE AUTHENTIC LEGACY
ADVANTAGE THAT SIERRA FOUND IN

1067
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,930
"SURE CLIVER: GAME CHANGERS"
 THIS IS THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE.

1068
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,130
IT HAS SIERRA'S NAME ON IT.

1069
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,030
I'M TOUCHING IT.

1070
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,770
IT'S THE SAME ONE.

1071
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:39,070
IT LOOKS LIKE JACOB FROM THE
OTHER TRIBE WILLED IT TO ME.

1072
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,670
WITH THIS NOTE IN YOUR
POSSESSION, YOU ARE GUARANTEED

1073
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:41,970
IMMUNITY.

1074
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,730
YOU MAY ONLY USE IT WHEN THERE
ARE 13 PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME

1075
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:51,000
OR WHEN THERE ARE ONLY SIX
PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME.

1076
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,830
IF SIERRA HADN'T TOLD PEOPLE
ABOUT IT, SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T

1077
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:57,070
HAVE GOTTEN VOTED OUT, BUT THE
PROBLEM IS I HAVE A REALLY BIG

1078
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,730
MOUTH.

1079
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:03,130
SO I NEED SOME STAPLE GUNS TO
KEEP THIS THING CLOSED.

1080
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:17,230
BUT THANK YOU, JACOB.

1081
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,870
THIS MORNING I START
FORMULATING A PLAN ABOUT WHAT

1082
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,170
I'M GOING TO TELL MY TRIBE ABOUT
WHAT GHOST ISLAND IS.

1083
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:27,200
AND I DECIDE THAT SINCE I
ALREADY SENT THE LEGACY

1084
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,230
ADVANTAGE TO MORGAN, AND SINCE
NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS

1085
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,370
PLACE, WHAT IF I JUST TAKE THE
TRUTH AND KIND OF STRETCH IT OUT

1086
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,100
A LITTLE BIT.

1087
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,700
SO I'M NOT GOING TO TELL THEM I
GOT THE LEGACY ADVANTAGE.

1088
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,730
I'M GOING TO TELL THEM I GOT AN
IDOL OUT OF THIS.

1089
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,570
THESE WERE THE BEADS ON OUR
TREE MAIL YESTERDAY, SO I TOOK

1090
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,130
THEM AND PUT THEM IN MY BAG.

1091
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,730
I DON'T THINK ANYONE NOTICED.

1092
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,800
I HAVE A SHELL, SOME TWINE, THIS
MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME

1093
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,430
TO BLUFF MY WAY THROUGH THE NEXT
TRIBAL COUNCIL IN CASE THINGS

1094
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:59,430
ARE BAD, BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
EXACTLY WHERE I STAND YET.

1095
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,230
HANGS A LITTLE WEIRD.

1096
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:00,870
THAT'S OKAY.

1097
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,330
THAT'S FINE.

1098
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:03,130
I'M IN THE LYING THROUGH MY
TEETH.

1099
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:06,470
I AM TELLING BASICALLY THE WHOLE
TRUTH.

1100
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,270
JUST ONE LITTLE DETAIL IS
DIFFERENT.

1101
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:11,270
AND THAT LITTLE DETAIL COULD
POSSIBLY SAVE MY LIFE.

1102
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:32,830
IT'S LIKE AN ASIAN DELICACY.

1103
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,770
REALLY?

1104
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,430
THEY'RE LITERALLY JUST SEA
SLUGS.

1105
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,970
THEY'RE VERY CHEWY.

1106
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,030
YOU GOT TO WORK FOR IT.

1107
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,930
YEAH.

1108
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,670
OH, GOD.

1109
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,300
JACOB'S BACK.

1110
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:44,570
HEY.

1111
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,430
THERE HE IS.

1112
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,400
JACOB.

1113
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,170
WHAT'S WRONG?

1114
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,500
WHO'S MISSING?

1115
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,670
GONZALEZ.

1116
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:51,570
REALLY?

1117
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,670
YEAH.

1118
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,600
WE ALL NEED TO TALK.

1119
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,500
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

1120
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,070
YOU'LL TELL ME EVERYTHING.

1121
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,100
YEAH.

1122
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,370
COMING BACK THE MY TRIBE, I
FELT LIKE I WAS IN A LOT OF

1123
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:06,470
TROUBLE, FORTUNATELY I HAVE THIS
FAKE IMMUNITY IDOL, AND THE

1124
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:11,000
TRUTH IS, I HAVE SOME DAMN GOOD
DECEPTION SKILLS, AN ANY

1125
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,670
OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER MY
POSITION IN THE GAME, I'M GOING

1126
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:14,730
TO TAKE.

1127
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,730
IT WASN'T YOUR NORMAL EXILE.

1128
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,570
THERE WAS A GIANT SIGN, ONE BAD
DECISION CAN HAUNT YOU FOREVER.

1129
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:25,370
THEN I WALK FURTHER, AND THERE'S
LIKE 13 TINY LITTLE CLAY URNS,

1130
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,070
AND IT SAYS, "SMASH THE URN."

1131
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:32,330
SO I'M SHOWING YOU THIS BECAUSE
IT'S GOING AGAINST ALL MY

1132
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,700
INSTINCTS TO SHOW YOU THIS
BECAUSE IT COULD PUT A TARGET ON

1133
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:43,100
MY BACK AND GET RID OF ME NEXT
TIME, BUT I PULLED IT OUT OF A

1134
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,770
BAMBOO CHUTE.

1135
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:48,870
I PUT IT IN MY SOCK, A LITTLE
TINY IMMUNITY IDOL AND THE SHELL

1136
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:49,700
HAS A LITTLE SKULL.

1137
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,000
YOU GOT NO BELIEVE ME HERE, I'M
GOING TO PLAY THIS AT THE NEXT

1138
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,130
TRIBAL NO MATTER WHAT, BECAUSE I
WANT THE STAY IN THIS GAME AS

1139
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:55,870
LONG AS I CAN.

1140
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,470
I DON'T WANT TO BE IDOL GUY.

1141
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:58,930
I NEVER WANTED TO BE IDOL GUY.

1142
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:03,300
DID YOUR IDOL HAVE --
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

1143
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,400
I DON'T HAVE IT UNFORTUNATELY.

1144
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,970
I THINK I LEFT IT AT GHOST
ISLAND.

1145
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,600
WELL, THANKS FOR SHARING.

1146
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,930
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE HONESTY.

1147
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:09,930
I DO, TOO.

1148
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,730
THANK YOU.

1149
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:11,700
THANK YOU.

1150
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,170
YEAH.

1151
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:15,400
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE MY
TRIBE ISN'T SUPER SUSPICIOUS OF

1152
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,670
ME, AND I THINK IT WORKED.

1153
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,230
I BELIEVE MY TRIBE BOUGHT IT.

1154
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,400
I BELIEVE MY TRIBE BELIEVES I
HAVE AN IDOL.

1155
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,670
AND I BELIEVE MY TRIBE BELIEVES
I'M GOING TO PLAY AN IDOL AT THE

1156
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,800
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL, SO I SHOULD
BE OKAY.

1157
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,830
I THINK IT'S FAKE IDOL.

1158
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:36,230
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THAT KID
FORGETS TO BRING THE NOTE.

1159
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:40,170
HOPEFULLY IT'S A FAKE IDOL
AND WE CAN JUST PIN OUR VOTES ON

1160
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:40,370
JACOB.

1161
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,200
EVERYBODY WOULD BE ON BOARD
FOR JACOB.

1162
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,700
YEAH.

1163
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,930
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE UP A
STORY, YOU BETTER THINK IT

1164
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,630
THROUGH, BECAUSE JACOB'S
FANTASTIC STORY ABOUT WINNING

1165
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,130
THIS IMMUNITY IDOL SEEMS
FAR-FETCHED TO ME, BECAUSE THERE

1166
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,600
IS NO CHANCE IN THE WORLD THAT
THIS "SURVIVOR" NERD FORGOT THE

1167
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,270
NOTE THAT CAME WITH THE IMMUNITY
IDOL BACK AT GHOST ISLAND.

1168
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:05,830
IF THERE IS EVEN A REMOTE CHANCE
THAT HE HAS A REAL IDOL AND WE

1169
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,630
PUTS ONE ON ONE OF US, WE'RE
GONE.

1170
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:12,800
DO YOU WANT THE MAKE HIM
COMFORTABLE WHEREAS IF HE HAS A

1171
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,170
REAL IDOL, HE DOESN'T PLAY IT.

1172
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:18,070
THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION
ABOUT JACOB'S IDOL.

1173
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,570
IS IT FAKE, IS IT REAL?

1174
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:20,330
WE DON'T KNOW.

1175
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:23,530
BUT WHEN SOMEBODY KNOWS THEY'RE
ON THE BOTTOM, THEY CAN CREATE

1176
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,800
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOMEBODY LIKE
ME.

1177
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,230
I'M AS BIG OF A SUPER FAN AS HE,
IS AND I'M WILLING TO USE HIM TO

1178
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:35,600
GET MYSELF FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

1179
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,830
WE DO EVERYTHING.

1180
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,270
USE YOUR HIPS.

1181
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,170
YOU MUST BE A GOOD SQUATTER.

1182
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,100
YEAH.

1183
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,530
SNATCH.

1184
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:44,970
THE POWER SNATCH?

1185
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:45,700
YEAH.

1186
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,500
YOU COME UP, YOU CLEAN IT.

1187
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:49,630
GOOD?

1188
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:53,130
IN THE BEGINNING I FELT WORRIED
ABOUT MY GAME, BUT I FOUND AN

1189
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,930
IDOL AND I FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY
DEVELOPING A GOOD RAPPORT WITH A

1190
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,000
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN
THIS TRIBE.

1191
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,900
BUT I HEARD THROUGH THE
GRAPEVINE THAT CHRIS WAS GUNNING

1192
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,630
FOR ME, SO I WANT TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH HIM TO LET HIM

1193
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,970
KNOW I REALLY JUST WANT TO KEEP
THINGS COOL AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN

1194
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:13,370
WORK TOGETHER.

1195
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:16,530
I REALLY FEEL THAT WE MISREAD
EACH OTHER.

1196
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:17,270
LET'S START FRESH.

1197
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,830
I WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU.

1198
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:22,730
FRANKLY, FROM THE BEGINNING I
THOUGHT YOU WERE GUNNING FOR ME.

1199
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,230
100% NOT.

1200
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,800
I LOVE YOU.

1201
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,830
I THINK YOU'RE AWESOME.

1202
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:32,100
I WANT TO JUST KEEP DOING WHAT
WE'RE DOING, SO JUST I'LL -- IT

1203
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,800
WILL -- YOU'LL SAY, ALL RIGHT,
HE MEANS IT.

1204
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,700
HAVE YOU FOUND THE IDOL.

1205
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,470
NO ONE HAS EVEN LOOKED.

1206
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,930
NO ONE HAS LOOKED.

1207
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,070
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

1208
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:43,730
IT'S JUST GOOD TO KNOW,
ESPECIALLY IF YOU AND I ARE

1209
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,230
TRYING TO DEVELOP A TRUST.

1210
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,130
YEAH.

1211
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:49,330
IF I KNEW YOU HAD IT, THEN WE
COULD WORK TOGETHER AND FIGURE

1212
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:49,800
OUT A PLAN.

1213
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,630
THE WAY CHRIS CAME AT ME OUT
OF THE GATE IMMEDIATELY MADE ME

1214
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,630
THINK HE WAS DEFINITELY ON TO
ME, BUT I'M NOT GOING THE PLAY

1215
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:57,170
DEFENSE.

1216
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,930
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE I HAVE
CHRIS IN MY CONTROL.

1217
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:04,030
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS
MESSING WITH.

1218
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,930
THE OTHER DAY I FOUND THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL SHELL.

1219
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:12,070
I LOOKED AT IT AND SAID, THIS
WOULD MAKE A GREAT IDOL SOME I

1220
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,300
DECIDE THE CREATE THIS FAKE IDOL
AND WRAP IT UP WITH THE

1221
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,070
PAPERWORK THAT CAME WITH MY REAL
IDOL.

1222
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:21,130
I BELIEVE I CAN EARN CHRIS'S
TRUST BY SHOWING HIM THE FAKE

1223
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:21,700
IDOL.

1224
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,230
IT'S GAMBLE, BUT I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO THROW IT OUT THERE AND

1225
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:28,270
SEE IF HE BITES.

1226
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,630
I HAVE AN IDOL.

1227
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,030
CAN YOU SHOW ME?

1228
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:31,470
YEAH.

1229
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,270
I WANT TO GO TO THE END WITH
YOU.

1230
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,470
OKAY.

1231
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,570
READ IT.

1232
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:36,870
IT'S SICK.

1233
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:40,330
BY SHOWING HIM THE PAPERWORK
THAT GOES WITH AN ACTUAL IDOL,

1234
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,500
IT DISTRACTED HIM FROM EVEN
LOOKING AT THE FAKE IDOL, AND

1235
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:48,670
SEEING HIS REACTION, I KNEW I
HAD HIM HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.

1236
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,100
I EVEN TOLD HIM, ANY TIME YOU
THINK YOU'RE VULNERABLE, YOU ASK

1237
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,870
ME, AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU,
NO PROBLEM.

1238
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,500
IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL IDOL.

1239
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,900
HE CAN TAKE IT HOME WITH HIM FOR
ALL I CARE.

1240
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,000
I HAVE NO PROBLEM PLAYING AN
IDOL FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

1241
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,730
DOMENICK SHOWED ME HIS IDOL
AND SAID HE WANTED TO TAKE ME TO

1242
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,400
THE END.

1243
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,970
SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS JUST OFF.

1244
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:13,000
WE GOT TO START TO TALK
TRACT.

1245
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,900
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE
THAT.

1246
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,300
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

1247
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,530
IF MY INSTINCT TELLS ME
SOMETHING IS OFF, I HAVE TO GO

1248
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:19,230
WITH IT.

1249
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,400
LY NOT GET VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME GOING AGAINST MY INSTINCT.

1250
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,070
KNOWING HE HAS AN IDOL SCARES
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

1251
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,070
IT'S UP TO ME AS A LEADER TO
ELIMINATE IT.

1252
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:50,570
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1253

01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,770
YOU GOT IT, DONATHAN.

1361
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,470
Jeff: DESIREE JUST MISSES.

1362
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,800
DONATHAN CLEARLY WANTED TO PART
OF THIS.

1363
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,100
NOW HE'S FORCED TO.

1364
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,900
MALOLO REMARKABLY IS STILL IN IT
AS NAVITI CAN ONLY SCORE ONE

1365
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,130
BASKET SO FAR.

1366
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:13,430
COME ON, DONATHAN, COME ON
BUDDY.

1367
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,170
DONATHAN, THIS IS ABOUT PERSONAL
ACHIEVE.

1368
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:15,730
RIGHT NOW.

1369
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:17,500
YOU CAN DO THIS.

1370
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:22,100
COMMIT AND GO.

1371
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,430
DONATHAN GOES DOWN.

1372
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:34,170
IT WOULD BE REMARKABLE IF
DONATHAN COULD PULL THIS OFF.

1373
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,030
AND HE DOES IT!

1374
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:40,000
DONATHAN AMAZES HIMSELF.

1375
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,600
DESIREE SCORES.

1376
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,330
NAVITI WITH TWO.

1377
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:47,300
OUT OF NOWHERE, A HERO HAS
EMERGED FOR MALOLO.

1378
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,000
DONATHAN, YOU'RE THE BEST.

1379
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,470
OH, MY GOD.

1380
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:50,870
GO, STEPHANIE.

1381
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:51,770
COME ON, STEPH.

1382
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:57,970
Jeff: WHEN THINGS LOOKED
OVER FOR MALOLO, DONATHAN DUG

1383
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:58,400
DEEP.

1384
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,530
WENDELL SCORES FOR MAF AND A
HALF.

1385
01:05:59,530 --> 01:05:59,970
THAT'S THREE.

1386
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:02,700
IT IS STEPHANIE QUICKLY SWIMMING
THIS COURSE.

1387
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,130
SHE'S STILL GOT TO COLLECT THE
BUOYS FOR MALOLO.

1388
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:07,830
NAVITI WITH THREE.

1389
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:08,900
THERE ARE EIGHT TOTAL.

1390
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:13,900
WE STILL GOT A CHALLENGE GOING
HERE.

1391
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:14,270
DESIREE SCORES.

1392
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,730
THAT IS FOUR FOR NAVITI.

1393
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:18,800
IT'S NOW WENDELL AGAIN.

1394
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,570
WENDELL SCORES THE FIFTH FOR
NAVITI.

1395
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:24,400
STEPHANIE, YOU'RE KILLING IT.

1396
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,300
STEPHANIE, YOU'RE KILLING IT.

1397
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,700
Jeff: MALOLO WORKING
QUICKLY.

1398
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,430
THEIR SHOOTERS READY TO GET IN
ON THIS.

1399
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:30,400
NAVITI WITH ANOTHER.

1400
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,600
GO, GO, GO.

1401
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,370
Jeff: THAT'S IT.

1402
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,900
YOU'RE IN, YOU GUYS ARE OUT.

1403
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,000
TWO PEOPLE IN THE WATER.

1404
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,970
NAVITI NOW HAS SEVEN.

1405
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,730
THEY ARE ONE AWAY.

1406
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,700
IT'S BRENDAN NOW SHOOTING FOR
MALOLO.

1407
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:45,370
THEY HAVE A LOT THE CATCH UP.

1408
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,100
DESIREE FOR THE WIN.

1409
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,870
SHE'S GOT IT.

1410
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:55,730
NAVITI WINS THEIR SECOND
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IN A ROW.

1411
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,830
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1412
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:57,230
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1413
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:58,070
THAT'S ON ME.

1414
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:59,370
YOU KILLED IT.

1415
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:01,830
YOU DID GREAT.

1416
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,070
I'M SO TIRED.

1417
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:07,570
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

1418
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,800
Jeff: NAVITI,
CONGRATULATIONS ONCE AGAIN.

1419
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,030
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

1420
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,800
DESIREE, YOU STOOD UP AND TOOK
THAT.

1421
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,200
NOBODY GOING HOME.

1422
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,730
IN ADDITION, MASSIVE REWARD OF
COMFORT WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU

1423
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,900
BACK AT CAMP.

1424
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,200
BEFORE WE GET TO GHOST ISLAND,
DONATHAN, EVEN THOUGH MALOLO

1425
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,530
LOST, ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, HOW
BIG OF AN ACCOMPLISH.

1426
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:29,030
WAS THAT FOR YOU.

1427
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:29,970
IT WAS HUGE.

1428
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:33,200
WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MY
FRIENDS HERE, YOU KNOW, THEY

1429
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,500
DEFINITELY WANTED ME TO TRY IT.

1430
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,900
AND I DID IT.

1431
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:45,900
NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS WOULD
I HAVE IMAGINED I'D DO THAT.

1432
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,730
Jeff: GHOST ISLAND.

1433
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,500
ONCE AGAIN, NAVITI, YOU CHOOSE
ONE PERSON FROM MALOLO TO GO TO

1434
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:57,870
GHOST ISLAND, WHICH MEANS THEY
CANNOT GO TO GHOST ISLAND.

1435
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:00,500
YOU SENT JACOB LAST TIME, WHO
ARE YOU SENDING THIS TIME?

1436
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,970
WE'RE SENDING DONATHAN.

1437
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:07,930
Jeff: WE'LL RETURN BACK THE
CAMP TOMORROW AFTER TRIBAL.

1438
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,170
GOOD-BYE, BUDDY.

1439
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,370
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, NAVITI.

1440
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:12,270
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

1441
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:13,400
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

1442
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,330
SWIM OUT AND CELEBRATE.

1443
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:19,230
ALL RIGHT.

1444
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:22,530
MALOLO, FOR THE SEEK TIME IN A
ROW, TRIBAL COUNCIL, SOMEBODY

1445
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:24,700
WILL BE THE SECOND PERSON VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME.

1446
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,430
HEAD ON OUT.

1447
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,700
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

1448
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,530
I WAS HOPING NAVITI WOULD
SEND ME BACK THE GHOST ISLAND.

1449
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:32,800
FORTUNATELY I HAVE THIS FAKE
IMMUNITY IDOL AND EVERYONE

1450
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,200
THINKS IT'S REAL.

1451
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,200
I'M GOING TO TRY THE USE IT TO
TAKE CONTROL OF THE GAME.

1452
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,670
WHEN I CHOSEN TO GO THE GHOST
ISLAND, I WAS DEFINITELY

1453
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:56,900
NERVOUS.

1454
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:03,400
THIS IS FIRST TIME BEING OFF BY
MYSELF, HAVING TO SURVIVE.

1455
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,630
SO MY MIND IS RACING.

1456
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:09,870
YOU KNOW, I DEFINITELY DON'T
WANT ANY GHOSTINGS AROUND ME.

1457
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:12,500
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO GET MYSELF
TOO PARANOID.

1458
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,000
IT'S A GAME.

1459
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,870
THINGS ARE GOING THE HAPPEN THE
WAY THEY'RE GOING TO HAPPEN.

1460
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,530
THE BIGGEST THING ABOUT
"SURVIVOR" IS YOU JUST HAVE TO

1461
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,130
ADAPT AND GO WITH THE FLOW.

1462
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:22,370
THAT'S MY MAIN GOAL OUT HERE.

1463
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:28,570
HOPEFULLY IT GIVES ME A GREAT
REWARD IN THE END.

1464
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:35,970
ONE BAD DECISION CAN HAUNT YOU
FOREVER.

1465
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:45,470
SMASH THE URN.

1466
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,930
NOPE, NOT TODAY.

1467
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:50,470
NO GAME FOR YOU.

1468
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:54,470
I GUESS NOBODY GOING TO SNOOP IN
MY BAG AND FIND ANYTHING.

1469
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,800
UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T GET THE
CHANCE THE PLAY, BUT FOR ME THIS

1470
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,200
WAS A CHANCE FOR ME TO PROVE
MYSELF.

1471
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,300
GROWING UP PEOPLE ALWAYS WAS
WANTING TO PUT ME DOWN.

1472
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,230
THEY WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, WHO'S
THIS LITTLE KID OUT HERE

1473
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:10,570
CHEERING AND DANCINGEN HE AIN'T
GOT NO TOUGHNESS IN HIM.

1474
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,600
BUT TODAY WHEN JAMES WAS OUT
THERE STRUGGLING, YOU KNOW, I

1475
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,470
HAD TO GO IN THERE AND MAKE
THOSE MOMENTS COUNT.

1476
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:20,230
SO I WAS DEFINITELY INTIMIDATED,
BUT I KNEW I WAS COMFORTABLE

1477
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:23,530
ENOUGH WITH MY SWIMMING TO BE
ABLE TO BE OKAY.

1478
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:27,630
I JUST SEEN THEM BALLS COME UP,
AND I'M LIKE, HOLY HELL, I DID

1479
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:28,100
THAT.

1480
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,100
IT'S MY FIRST FIRE ON MY OWN.

1481
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,800
PRETTY PROUD OF MYSELF RIGHT
NOW.

1482
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,470
HOPEFULLY WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME
BEING OUT HERE AND BEING LIKE A

1483
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:40,100
LITTLE MOUNTAIN MAN, IT'S GOING
TO BE SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEIR

1484
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,770
EYES WIDE AND THEIR MOUTHS DROP.

1485
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,930
BEING OUT HERE IS DEFINITELY
LIKE OPENING MY EYES AND GIVING

1486
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:48,630
ME CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF THAT I
CAN, YOU KNOW, BE THE PERSON

1487
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:51,130
THAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT I COULD.

1488
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,930
I CAME OUT HERE TO PLAY.

1489
01:10:52,930 --> 01:11:09,300
I'M HERE TO WIN.

1490
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,830
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

1491
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,470
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT, OKAY.

1492
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:20,470
I GOT A JOB TO DO, I FAILED TO
DO IT, SO IT'S ON ME.

1493
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:23,070
IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET
ANOTHER CHANCE, I'LL DO

1494
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,430
EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO
REDEEM MYSELF, BUT I CHOKED.

1495
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:27,470
IT'S COOL.

1496
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:29,430
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP OVER IT.

1497
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:32,500
SERIOUS.

1498
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,870
MY IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
PERFORMANCE WAS PATHETIC.

1499
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:38,230
MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME BACK IN
KOREA TO GIVE EVERYTHING, YOUR

1500
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:41,400
BEST EFFORT, BUT INSTEAD I COST
US THE WIN TODAY.

1501
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,170
THAT'S A FACT.

1502
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,730
LIKE THERE'S IN WAY AROUND IT.

1503
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:46,230
I FEEL LIKE HELL.

1504
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:50,670
NOW PEOPLE MIGHT BE THINKING OF
LETTING ME GO BECAUSE HE'S TO

1505
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:51,100
BLAME.

1506
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,130
JAMES COULDN'T EVEN GO DOWN
THREE FEET.

1507
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:56,400
AND I KNOW THAT'S ONE CHALLENGE.

1508
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:56,930
YEAH.

1509
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:58,470
BUT WE GOT TO GET JACOB.

1510
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:02,200
I DON'T LIKE THE UNCERTAINTY OF
DOES HE HAVE AN IDOL.

1511
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,930
BEST-CASE SCENARIO, HE HAS IT
AND HE DOESN'T PLAY IT BECAUSE

1512
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,100
HE THINKS HE'S SENDING ONE OF US
HOME.

1513
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:12,300
BUT THE QUESTION IS DO WE HEDGE
OUR BET AND ALSO THROW VOTES AT

1514
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:12,500
JAMES?

1515
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,970
I THINK WE GOT TO.

1516
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:16,600
JAMES IS MUSCLED UP, BUT I DON'T
KNOW WHAT HE BRINGS.

1517
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,430
EVEN THOUGH JAMES SKEWED UP
BADLY, HE'S PLAN "B."

1518
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,300
THE REAL TARGET IS JACOB.

1519
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,630
IF THE IDOL IS REAL, IT COULD
DEFINITELY BLOW UP IN OUR FACE,

1520
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:29,230
SO WE GOT TO GET RID OF HIM, BUT
WE GOT TO BE-CAREFUL ABOUT HOW

1521
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:29,970
WE DO IT.

1522
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:33,400
IF WE CAN MAKE HIM FEEL ROCK
SOLID HE'S GOOD, THEN HE'S GOING

1523
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,170
TO WANT TO HOLD ON TO IT AND
PLAY IT THE NEXT TIME.

1524
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:36,570
RIGHT.

1525
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,800
HE'S GOT TO FEEL REALLY
COMFORTABLE.

1526
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,830
EXACTLY.

1527
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:47,170
COOL.

1528
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:48,400
I DON'T KNOW.

1529
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,230
LIKE IF I WANT TO START PLAYING,
AND I FEEL LIKE NOBODY WANTS THE

1530
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:52,600
PLAY YET.

1531
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,530
I DO.

1532
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:54,500
YOU DO?

1533
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:59,330
I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY'S LIKE
KUMBAYA.

1534
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:00,130
THAT'S GREAT.

1535
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,930
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON THE SAME
WAVELENGTH.

1536
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:04,870
WE SLEEP BY EACH OTHER.

1537
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:06,930
YOU ARE THE PEOPLE I WOULD LOVE
TO WORK WITH.

1538
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:09,200
IT'S TRUE.

1539
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,000
I'M LIKE YOU.

1540
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,930
I'M USING MY LITTLE FLIRTATIOUS
WAYS TO GET TO THE TRUTH ABOUT

1541
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:17,770
HIS IDOL, AND THE THING ABOUT
JACOB IS HE'S A STRATEGIC

1542
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:18,200
SUPERFAN.

1543
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,170
SO THE WAY TO GET IN HIS HEAD IS
TO TALK STRATEGY WITH HIM.

1544
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,070
OKAY.

1545
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,570
LOOK, WE KNOW THIS GAME.

1546
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:27,630
THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A
TRIBE SWAP.

1547
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:32,370
I WAS THINKING TO GET ONE OF
THE STRONG GUYS BEFORE THE SWAP,

1548
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:37,770
AS MUCH AS I LIKE MICHAEL,
ANYONE WHO TELLS ME TRIBE

1549
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:39,200
STRENGTH IS WORRYING ME.

1550
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,730
TURNS OUT STEPHANIE IS A
HARD-CONSIDER FAN LIKE ME AND

1551
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:44,730
SHE ALSO THINKS MICHAEL IS A
THREAT.

1552
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:48,070
DON'T GET ME WRONG, HE'S A GREAT
GUY, EAGLE SCOUT, CREME DE LA

1553
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:52,630
CREME, AND I BET WOMEN ARE ALL
OVER HIM BACK HOME IN L.A.

1554
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:55,270
I'M SURE HE'S DOING GREAT FOR
HIMSELF, BUT I FEEL LIKE HE'S

1555
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,630
GOING THE MAKE DIFFICULT FOR
THOSE OF US WHO AREN'T SUPER

1556
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:57,900
STRONG.

1557
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,870
SO I COULD PROBABLY PULL
JAMES NO PROBLEM.

1558
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,000
I THINK ME, JAMES AND LAUREL
EVEN.

1559
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,100
I THINK LAUREL PROBABLY WOULD GO
WITH US, TOO.

1560
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,000
SWEET.

1561
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,200
THAT'S A MAJORITY RIGHT
THERE.

1562
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,870
WE'RE AN UNLIKELY PAIR, BUT
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

1563
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:14,770
IF I CAN GET IN THE GOOD GRACES
OF SOMEONE LIKE STEPHANIE, WHO

1564
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:18,200
IS NOT ONLY BEAUTIFUL BUT ALSO
JUST REALLY GOOD AT THIS GAME,

1565
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,770
WE COULD GO VERY FAR TOGETHER.

1566
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,330
I'M PRETTY STOKED.

1567
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:24,730
SO I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, I
LIED ABOUT ONE THING AND I'M

1568
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,530
ONLY GOING TO TELL YOU BECAUSE I
TRUST YOU.

1569
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,070
OKAY.

1570
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,070
IDOL IS NOT REAL.

1571
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:30,400
SHUT UP.

1572
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,130
I TELL YOU THIS, EVERYTHING
ELSE I SAID WAS REAL.

1573
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:33,770
I DID WIN.

1574
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:37,630
I OPENED THE DAMN THING, LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.

1575
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:40,830
THE NOTE SAYS YOU HAVE TO GIFT
THE ADVANTAGE TO SOMEONE ON THE

1576
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:41,170
OTHER TRIBE.

1577
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,330
SHUT UP.

1578
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:45,530
WHO DID YOU GIVE IT TO
 I GAVE IT TO MORGAN.

1579
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:48,430
SHE SEEMS LEVEL HEADED AND THE
KIND OF PERSON THAT WILL RESPOND

1580
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:49,200
TO LOGIC.

1581
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,530
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE I
SEE MYSELF WORKING WITH.

1582
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,970
I'M TELLING YOU THAT BECAUSE
I'M RELYING ON YOU.

1583
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,770
WE'RE AN UNLIKELY COUPLE.

1584
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,370
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.

1585
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:03,330
JACOB DIVULGED EVERYTHING TO
ME.

1586
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:04,200
HIS IDOL WAS FAKE.

1587
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,970
I KNEW IT IN MY BONES.

1588
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:11,130
AND THEN HE TOLD ME THAT MORGAN
ON THE OTHER TRIBE NOW HAS HIS

1589
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,100
LEGACY ADVANTAGE.

1590
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:12,730
THAT'S HUGE.

1591
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:16,600
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I CAN USE
TO MY ADVANTAGE LATER ON IN THIS

1592
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,400
GAME.

1593
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,400
NOW I AM ACTUALLY REALLY
STRUGGLING WITH THIS JACOB VOTE.

1594
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,030
HE TRUSTS ME.

1595
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:29,600
AND THOSE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE
YOU WANT TO KEEP AROUND.

1596
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,270
LONG STORY SHORT, HE'S LIKE, I
THINK I CAN PULL IN JAMES AND

1597
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:37,100
LAUREL, AND, YOU KNOW, WE COULD
MAYBE LIKE THINK ABOUT ONE OF

1598
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,000
THE BIG GUYS.

1599
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,600
SO HE WANTS TO TARGET MICHAEL.

1600
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,500
HE'S TOTALLY INTO LIKE YOU AND
I.

1601
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:49,400
SO I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD --
 HE'S LOYAL LONG TERM.

1602
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:49,970
YEAH.

1603
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:53,030
STEPHANIE WANTS TO WORK WITH
JACOB AND START VOTING OFF THE

1604
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,670
BIG PLAYERS.

1605
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,170
I WAS SHOCKED AT FIRST.

1606
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:57,000
JACOB IS NOT THE SMARTEST GUY IN
THE WORLD.

1607
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
HE HAS A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE, BUT
HE HAS NO SOCIAL SKILLS.

1608
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,170
AND HE'S JUST ANNOYING.

1609
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:05,300
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO
DO.

1610
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,500
YEAH.

1611
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,900
HOWEVER, STEPHANIE AND I HAVE
BEEN CLOSE SINCE DAY ONE.

1612
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,970
I WANT THE STAY LOYAL TO HER
SOME WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO DO,

1613
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:16,700
I'LL GO ALONG WITH IT.

1614
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,600
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

1615
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,430
I DON'T KNOW, HEY, PROBABLY.

1616
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:25,000
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE,
HE WASN'T REALLY GOOD IN THAT

1617
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,730
CHALLENGE, SO WE SHOULD VOTE HIM
OUT.

1618
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,730
EXACTLY.

1619
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:30,500
SO STEPHANIE THROUGH OUT MICHAEL
AS A NAME.

1620
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:30,970
YEAH.

1621
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:34,970
SO FAR THE STRONG AND THE
BEAUTIFUL HAVE BEEN RUNNING THE

1622
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:35,470
SHOW.

1623
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:38,270
THEY'VE FORMED A LITTLE BIT OF A
CLICK WITHOUT ME, AND THAT

1624
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:41,570
WORRIES ME, BUT SUDDENLY THE
PEOPLE ON THE BOTTOM HAVE AN

1625
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:44,030
OPPORTUNITY TO FLIP THE VOTE ON
THEM.

1626
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,730
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S THE
RIGHT TIME.

1627
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:49,870
GUYS, DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING
IS AS IT SEEMS RIGHT NOW?

1628
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:53,370
I'M REALLY HOPING SOME
 HERE'S WHAT IT IS.

1629
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:56,530
EITHER JENNA AND STEPH ARE
PULLING A DOUBLE CROSS ABOUT

1630
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,070
JACOB, OR IT'S THE DOUBLE-DOUBLE
CROSS, AND THEY'RE GETTING ONE

1631
01:16:59,070 --> 01:16:59,570
OF US.

1632
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:00,770
UH-HUH.

1633
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:02,630
THAT'S WHY I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

1634
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:06,770
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING THE
PLAY HIM, BUT, YOU NEVER KNOW.

1635
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:09,870
JENNA AND STEPH ARE
SCRATCHING ME OUT, BECAUSE JACOB

1636
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:13,770
IS A SHIFTY GUY AND FOR ALL I
KNOW HE'S TARGETING ME.

1637
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:16,900
AND ALL IT TAKES IS A COUPLE
PEOPLE TO FLIP WITH HIM AND I

1638
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,500
COULD BE GONE.

1639
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,070
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

1640
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,330
I'M READY TO PLAY.

1641
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:23,730
IF I GET VOTED OUT BY FRICKING
JACOB, I'M GOING TO BE PISSED

1642
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:25,730
OFF.

1643
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:48,200
Jeff: JACOB BEHIND YOU IS A
TORCH.

1644
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,470
GO AHEAD AND GRAB IT.

1645
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,930
APPROACH THE FLAME.

1646
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:56,700
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1647
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,630
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS

1648
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:01,730
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1649
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:04,470
WHEN THE FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

1650
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:06,200
ALL RIGHT
JAMES, LET'S GET TO THE

1651
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:06,900
CHALLENGE.

1652
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,730
BECAUSE THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE
TONIGHT.

1653
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:12,200
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DONATHAN,
AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER.

1654
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,470
IS THAT FAIR TO SAY?

1655
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:17,500
I'VE BEEN AN ATHLETE FOR MANY
YEARS, AND TODAY I DID ONE OF

1656
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,570
THE WORST THINGS THAT AN ATHLETE
CAN DO, WHICH IS LET HIS OWN

1657
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:20,870
TEAM DOWN.

1658
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,370
I HAD A JOB TO CO, AND I FAILED.

1659
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:27,600
I HATE MYSELF, BUT I REALLY WANT
TO PUT THIS LOSS ON ME, LIKE I'M

1660
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,400
THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE.

1661
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,800
Jeff: STEPHANIE, JAMES IS
REALLY OWNING IT, WHICH IS

1662
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,970
ADMIRABLE, BUT HE'S EXPOSED THAT
HE CHOKED.

1663
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:39,630
THERE IS AN ELEMENT TO ME
THAT GIVES JAMES CREDIT FOR EVEN

1664
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:41,170
TRYING TO DO IT.

1665
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:45,000
BUT IT'S A BIG REASON WHY WE
LOST, AND IN THE END IT KIND OF

1666
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,800
PUT US BACK A LITTLE BIT.

1667
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,030
Jeff: JACOB, YOU WERE THE
FIRST PERSON TO GO TO GHOST

1668
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:53,270
ISLAND, DID PEOPLE ASK YOU,
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

1669
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:53,770
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

1670
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,800
I WAS JUMPING OUT OF MY PANTS
TRYING TO GET THAT INFORMATION

1671
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,430
OUT.

1672
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:59,200
I PRETTY MUCH TOLD THEM
EVERYTHING.

1673
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,430
I EVEN TOLD THEM ABOUT MY
OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING AN

1674
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:02,100
ADVANTAGE.

1675
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,700
Jeff: LIBBY, WHAT DID HE
SHARE REGARDING THIS OPPORTUNITY

1676
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,270
FOR ADVANTAGES HE TALKED ABOUT.

1677
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:12,100
HE SHOWED US THAT HE FOUND A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1678
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,700
SO THAT SURPRISED US.

1679
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,630
Jeff: JAMES, THE OTHER
QUESTION IS YOU REALLY HAVE NO

1680
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:17,430
IDEA WHAT GHOST ISLAND IS ABOUT.

1681
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:22,070
THERE DEFINITELY IS SOME KIND
OF INFORMATION IMBALANCE.

1682
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:24,670
JACOB HAS BEEN THERE AND SPENT A
NIGHT ON THE ISLAND, AND WE

1683
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:27,100
HAVEN'T, BUT HE'S ONE OF OUR
ALLIES.

1684
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,770
WE CAN TRUST HIM AND HIS STORY.

1685
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:33,330
Jeff: GREAT PHRASE,
"INFORMATION IMBALANCE."

1686
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:37,170
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE "SURVIVOR"
OFTEN TIP, THE INFORMATION

1687
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:37,530
IMBALANCE.

1688
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:40,600
SO JACOB, WHEN YOU REJOINED THE
TRIBE, DID YOU FEEL WELCOMED.

1689
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,900
I FELT WELCOME TO A
SURPRISING DEGREE.

1690
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,170
I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE
VITRIOL.

1691
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:49,070
IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS TRIBE,

1692
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:52,170
AND IT MAKES ME FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD.

1693
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:55,030
Jeff: SO STILL FEEL GOOD
WITH THIS TRIBE?

1694
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:56,230
ABSOLUTELY.

1695
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:59,370
I STILL BELIEVE 100% THESE ARE
SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE THAT

1696
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,830
HAVE EVER BEEN ON "SURVIVOR."

1697
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:06,170
Jeff: STEPHANIE, WHERE DO
YOU SIT ON THIS IDEA THAT JACOB

1698
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:08,230
HAS, GLASS HALF FULL.

1699
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:11,570
Jeff: IN MY LIFE I AM GLASS
HALF FULL TYPE OF PERSON, AS

1700
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:11,930
WELL.

1701
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:14,070
I THINK THAT'S WHO HE IS AS A
PERSON.

1702
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:16,130
Jeff: JACOB, IS THAT REALLY
THE WAY YOU ARE?

1703
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:17,570
GOD, NO.

1704
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:20,300
I'M A NEUROTIC PARANOID INDOOR
KID.

1705
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,070
MAYBE WHEN I COME OUT WITH THAT
KIND OF BRAVADO IT'S SO I CAN

1706
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:28,370
FEEL LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO JUST
DIE ON THE SPOT.

1707
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,830
I HAVE A DREAM ACTED GETTING TO
THE END OF THIS GAME, AND TO DO

1708
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:34,700
THAT I HAVE TO FIGHT ALL THE
FEARS THAT COME WITH IT.

1709
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:38,270
Jeff: JENNA, WHERE IS THE
TRIBE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF

1710
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:38,530
ALLIANCES?

1711
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:40,130
THIS IS OUR SECOND TRIBAL.

1712
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:43,700
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE THOUGHT IN ALLIANCES AND

1713
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,430
STUFF LIKE THAT.

1714
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,630
WE'RE KIND OF MOVING AROUND A
LITTLE BIT.

1715
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:48,470
SO I THINK THIS ONE WILL BE A
LITTLE DIFFERENT.

1716
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,030
Jeff: JACOB YOU'RE SHAKING
YOUR HEAD.

1717
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:50,330
YOU AGREE?

1718
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:53,530
THIS GAME IS BECOMING WAY
MORE ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND WAY

1719
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:56,430
MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU TRUST
AND WAY MORE ABOUT LOYALTY.

1720
01:20:56,430 --> 01:21:01,200
Jeff: SO IS THERE ANY
CONCERN, EVEN THOUGH YOU GOT A

1721
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,670
WARM WELCOME THAT YOU MIGHT BE
OUT OF A GROUP.

1722
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:06,670
ABSOLUTELY.

1723
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:10,800
FOR ALL I KNOW, THEY GATHERED UP
AND SAID, MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD AND

1724
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,070
WE'LL GET HIM NEXT TIME.

1725
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:12,830
I DON'T KNOW.

1726
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:15,130
I HOPE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, BUT IT
COULD HAPPEN.

1727
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:18,800
ANY WORK I'VE PUT IN TO HELP
MYSELF AND MY ALLIES AND MY

1728
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,830
FRIENDS, IT MIGHT ALL BE IN
VEIN.

1729
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:25,000
Jeff: MICHAEL, HOW ABOUT
FOR YOU?

1730
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,500
WHAT ABOUT RELATIONSSHIPS
FORMING AND GROWING.

1731
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,530
THAT BECOMES A BIG PART OF THE
VOTE.

1732
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:31,270
HE'S A HUGE PART OF IT.

1733
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:32,700
LAST VOTE WAS PRETTY UNANIMOUS.

1734
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,730
BUT TWO LOSSES BACK TO BACK, WE
GOT TO START DOING SOMETHING

1735
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:39,230
DIFFERENT, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT
TO KEEP THIS BAD MOMENTUM GOING.

1736
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:42,100
Jeff: DO YOU TAKE SOME
MEASURE OF COMFORT THAT YOU'RE

1737
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,300
OKAY BECAUSE THEY NEED YOUR
STRENGTH?

1738
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,000
NO.

1739
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,830
I DON'T.

1740
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:48,100
I DON'T THINK THIS IS ALL ABOUT
PHYSICAL STRENGTH AT THIS POINT.

1741
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,700
I THINK THOSE DAYS ARE OVER IN
"SURVIVOR."

1742
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,570
SO, YEAH, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT
WORRIED.

1743
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:54,400
Jeff: MICHAEL.

1744
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,970
DOES THAT CONCERN YOU, BECAUSE
YOU'RE CLEARLY A PHYSICALLY FIT

1745
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:57,300
GUY.

1746
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,130
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

1747
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:02,770
HEARING BRENDAN SAY THAT, I SURE
HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE, BUT

1748
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:09,700
I'M TRUSTING THE ALLIANCES I'VE
MADE AND THE PLAN TONIGHT.

1749
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,900
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1750
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,700
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1751
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:20,370
JENNA, YOU'RE UP.

1752
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,270
WE HAVE TWO EARS AND ONE
MOUTH FOR A REASON.

1753
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:51,100
LISTEN MORE.

1754
01:22:52,930 --> 01:23:03,100
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

1755
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,700
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1756
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:13,930
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1757
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:14,170
OKAY.

1758
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:16,170
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

1759
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:17,570
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1760
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:18,230
IMMEDIATELY.

1761
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:22,670
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1762
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:28,170
FIRST VOTE MICHAEL.

1763
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,230
JAMES.

1764
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:31,900
JACOB.

1765
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:38,100
ONE VOTE MICHAEL, ONE VOTE
JAMES, ONE VOTE JACOB.

1766
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:38,600
JAMES.

1767
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,930
THAT'S TWO VOTES JAMES.

1768
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:42,700
JACOB.

1769
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,700
OH, NO.

1770
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:49,670
Jeff: TWO VOTES JAMES, TWO
VOTES JACOB, ONE VOTE MICHAEL.

1771
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:50,300
JACOB.

1772
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:58,830
THAT'S THREE VOTES JACOB, TWO
VOTES JAMES, ONE VOTE MICHAEL.

1773
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,470
MAN.

1774
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,930
Jeff: SECOND PERSON VOTED
OUT OF "SURVIVOR: GHOST ISLAND,"

1775
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:03,430
JACOB.

1776
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:15,400
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1777
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,500
BY, OH, BOY.

1778
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,330
Jeff: JACOB, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

1779
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,070
YOU ALL DID GOOD.

1780
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:36,170
Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1781
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:39,200
Jeff: WELL, WE'RE ONLY SIX
DAYS IN BUT YOU'RE 0-2 AND DOWN

1782
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,000
TWO TRIBE MEMBERS.

1783
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,070
SOMETHING'S GOT THE CHANGE FAST
FOR "SURVIVOR'S" GREATEST TRIBE.

1784
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:45,830
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

1785
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:47,630
GOOD NIGHT.

 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1789
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,200
NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR. A SUPRISE
TWIST CATCHES EVERYONE OFF 

1790
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:13,000
GAURD. DROP YOUR BOX YOUR
SWITCHING TRIBES. I KNEW I

1791
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
WASNT GOING TO BE IN POWER THE
WHOLE GAME BUT YOU GOTTA RIDE

1792
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,370
THE WAVE. WHAT HAS HAPPEND OVER 
HERE? AND GHOST ISLAND IS BACK

1793
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:24,030
IN PLAY. I AM FREAKING OUT.

1794
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:27,500
I PUT SO MUCH WORK IN TO GET
HERE. AND AT THE FIRST TRIBAL

1795
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,970
I ATTENDED, I WAS VOTED OUT. IM
EMBARRASSED. I DONT KNOW IF I

1796
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:32,370
EVEN HAVE A GAME TO BE PROUD OF.

1797
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:37,330
DONT GET ME WRONG, IT WAS ALL,
THERE BUT IT WAS ALLIANCES THAT

1798
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:40,500
I MADE UP IN MY HEAD THAT DIDNT
ACTUALLY EXIST.

1799
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,500
IT SOUNDS PATHETIC, BUT IT HURTS
ON A VERY DEEP LEVEL.
