00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,797
"SURVIVOR": AT GALANG THE WOMEN

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,550
WERE IN CONTROL, LEAVING VYTAS,

4
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,843
THE ONLY MALE OF THE TRIBE, ON

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:10,677
THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,137
>> THERE'S ME AND THERE'S FIVE

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:12,345
GIRLS.

8
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,680
I'M THE ODD MAN OUT.

9
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,391
>> Jeff: OVER AT TADHANA, ARAS

10
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,517
THOUGHT HE WAS IN CONTROL.

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,603
>> I KNOW VYTAS WILL COME WITH

12
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,062
US.

13
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,063
I HAVE A REALLY DOMINANT

14
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,064
POSITION IN THE GAME

15
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,607
>> Jeff: BUT IT WAS TYSON WHO

16
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,652
WAS PULLING THE STRINGS,

17
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,195
GAG IDLE INFORMATION.

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,156
AND PUTTING TOGETHER A MAJORITY

19
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,032
ALLIANCE OF FIVE.

20
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,200
>> US FIVE.

21
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,994
AND THEN IT'S SMOOTH SAILING.

22
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,495
>> I'M GOOD FOR THAT.

23
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:37,787
>> HAPPY?

24
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,621
>> SOLID.

25
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,415
>> WE KNOW WE CAN TRUST EACH

26
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,000
OTHER BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

27
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,376
ANYONE OVER THERE WE TRUST MORE.

28
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,128
>> Jeff: TYSON DOES IT!

29
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,505
TADHANA WINS IMMUNITY.

30
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,965
AFTER GALANG LOST THE IMMUNITY

31
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:49,257
CHALLENGE--

32
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,301

FEELINGS.

37
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,309
>> I FELT LIKE I COULD TRUST

38
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,020
LAURA B., BUT NOW I JUST DON'T

39
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:02,228
KNOW.

40
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,438
>> Jeff: AND IN THE END, SHE

41
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,607
GOT HER WISH.

42
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:05,815

LAURA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

46
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,614
10 ARE LEFT.

47
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:17,660
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

48

Drive one.

52
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,208
>> WELL, THANKS FOR HAVING MY

53
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,292
BACK, GUYS.

54
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,126
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

55
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:25,335
LIKE.

56
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,880
>> FEEL-- I DO FEEL SUCH TRUST

57
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:29,422
IN THIS GROUP.

58
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:29,672
>> UH-HUH.

59
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,132
>> HOW LUCKY ARE WE?

60
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,176
>> THAT BASED ON WHAT THE

61
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,595
NUMBERS ARE, THIS IS MY FIVE.

62
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,555
I'M SPEAKING FOR ARAS AS WELL.

63
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,306
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, WE'VE

64
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,225
GOT THIS THING TIGHT, IT'S

65
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:40,475
LOCKED.

66
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,684
>> YEAH.

67
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,603
>> SO YOU THINK THAT ARAS HAS

68
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,355
GERVASE 100% AND HE WON'T WAVER?

69
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,523
>> YUP.

70
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,816
>> I BELIEVE THAT, TOO.

71
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,316
>> OKAY.

72
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,070
>> AND THAT MAKES SIX, AND IT IT

73
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,238
GOES DOWN TOMORROW, THAT'S 11,

74
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,614
AND SIX IS THE MAJORITY, AND

75
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,615
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT NEEDS

76
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:55,907
TO BE SAID.

77
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,534
THE MERGE IS COMING SOON.

78
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,159
AT THIS POINT, IT'S FIVE

79
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,285
TOGETHER NO MATTER WHAT.

80
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,162
WE'RE STANDING FOR A CERTAIN WAY

81
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,705
OF PLAYING THIS GAME.

82
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,873
WE'RE GOING TO BE MORAL.

83
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,041
WE'RE GOING TO BE HONEST.

84
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,209
EVEN IT MEANS OUR DEATH.

85
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,378
THAT'S NOT HOW I FEEL BUT THAT'S

86
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,629
WHAT I'M RAPPING TO THEM.

87
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,214
>> I THINK MONICA AT THIS POINT

88
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,758
HAD TO DO MORE TO STICK HER NECK

89
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,301
OUT FOR US THAN GERVASE HAS.

90
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,971
AND THAT WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO

91
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,682
FIVE AND SIX, THAT-- YOU KNOW,

92
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,684
WE'D PUT HER IN THAT FIVE SPOT

93
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,351
INSTEAD OF THE SIX SPOT.

94
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,853
>> I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT.

95
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,979
>> I THINK THAT LOYALTY SHOULD

96
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,021
BE REWARDED.

97
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,398
>> THAT MEANS A LOT, ESPECIALLY

98
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,899
COMING FROM YOU, TINA.

99
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,358
>> WELL, I DO MEAN IT.

100
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,069
>> THANK YOU.

101
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,988
WE JUST GOT BACK FROM TRIBAL

102
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,155
COUNCIL, AND, YOU KNOW, TINA

103
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,407
MAKES AN ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT

104
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,367
THAT OKAY, GREAT, WE REALLY

105
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:39,909
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'RE

106
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,328
DOING, MONICA, AND YOU'RE NUMBER

107
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:42,537
FIVE.

108
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,290
>> WE'RE IN A PRETTY GOOD SPOT

109
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,001
AS LONG AS ARAS IS ON BOARD.

110
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:48,376
>> HE WILL BE.

111
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,003
>> IF WE MERGE, IT'S GOING TO BE

112
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,170
DIFFICULT WHEN PEOPLE COME TO ME

113
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:59,178
WITH AN OFFER BETTER THAN FIVE.

114
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,016
>> HEY, GUYS.

115
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:03,266
GUESS WHO?

116
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,517
>> HEY, WHO IS IT?

117
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,727
THE OTHER LAURA.

118
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,352
DAY 18.

119
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,690
I THEY WROTE DOWN LAURA B., AND

120
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,816
HERE I AM.

121
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,902
IT'S A HUGELY HORRIBLE

122
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,737
NONSTRATEGIC MOVE TO GET RID OF

123
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,196
ME AND KEEP VYTAS.

124
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,364
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.

125
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,741
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

126
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,366
>> OH, MY GOSH.

127
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,494
THE GIRLS WERE ALL AGREEING TO

128
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,787
SEND VYTAS HOME.

129
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,289
>> THAT'S WHO I THOUGHT WAS GOG

130
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:26,456
WALK?

131
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,916
>> I'M TRYING TO BE A NICE,

132
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,336
HONEST PERSON, AND I TOLD HIM

133
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:31,628
HERE I AM.

134
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,755
AND THEY DIDN'T GO WITH THE PLAN

135
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,050
THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING.

136
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:37,216
SO.

137
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,301
>> I WAS PRETTY SURE IT WAS

138
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,928
GOING TO BE VYTAS, TOO.

139
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:40,762
>> THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

140
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,054
SMART MOVE.

141
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,889
>> THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

142
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,181
SMART MOVE.

143
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:43,723
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

144
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,266
>> IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN VYTAS.

145
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,017
>> EXACTLY.

146
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,185
I DON'T FREAKING GET IT.

147
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,019
I DON'T GET IT.

148
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,854
I THINK IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE FOR

149
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,480
THOSE GIRLS TO LEAVE VYTAS IN

150
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,273
THE GAME.

151
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,858
THE MERGE, YOU KNOW, COULD BE

152
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,944
TOMORROW, AND HERE'S VYTAS

153
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:56,569
JOINING HIS BROTHER, JOINING ALL

154
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,654
THOSE GUYS.

155
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,488
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE UP ON THE

156
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,155
THE GIRLS.

157
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,200
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

158
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,451
RIDICULOUS.

159
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:10,458
>> OH, THIS IS ROUGH.

160
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:14,837
>> ALL RIGHT.

161
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,339
>> OH, MY GOD, HERE WE GO.

162
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,091
>> OH, MY GOSH!

163
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:18,508
"THE DAY IS HERE.

164
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,342
DO OUR DIE.

165
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,637
FOLLOWING TODAY'S DUEL, THE

166
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,892
WINNER WILL RE-ENTER THE GAME.

167
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,602
THE LOSERS WILL LEAVE THE GAME

168
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,561
FOR GOOD."

169
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,854
IT'S HAPPENING TODAY.

170
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,940
>> THIS FINAL DUEL IS THE ONLY

171
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:34,524
DUEL THAT REALLY MATTERS.

172
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,317
UN, ONE PERSON GOES BACK IN THE

173
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:36,526
GAME.

174
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,527
TWO PEOPLE GO HOME.

175
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,320
THIS FINAL DUEL IS WHAT I'VE

176
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,532
BEEN TRAINING FOR, FOR 12 DAYS.

177
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,408
I HAVE TO WIN THIS DUEL TODAY.

178
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,119
I'D BE DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.

179
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,578
CANDICE WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IN

180
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:47,745
ME.

181
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,204
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.

182
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,289
>> ALL RIGHT, I'LL MAKE THE

183
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:50,498
RICE.

184
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,458
>> I'M EITHER GOING TO GO HOME

185
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:52,667
TODAY.

186
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,418
MY GAME IS GOING TO BE OVER, OR

187
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,336
I'M GOING BACK IN IT.

188
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,796
NO SECOND PLACE IS GOOD ENOUGH

189

266
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:31,802

376
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,019
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LAURA B.,

377
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:09,937
YOUR TIME IN THIS GAME IS DONE.

378
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,480
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

379
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,774
YOU CAN TOSS YOUR BUFF IN THE

380
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,484
URN ON THE WAY OUT.

381
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,318
>> GOOD JOB.

382
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,195
>> I'LL LEAVE IT GRACEFULLY.

383
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,364
YOU GUYS TAKE CARE.

384
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,867
THANKS, JEFF.

385
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,411
>> Jeff: JOHN, SHAKING YOUR

386
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:25,995
HEAD ALREADY.

387
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,913
>> DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE, JEFF.

388
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,249
I WAS OUT ON REDEMPTION ISLAND

389
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,625
FOR 12 DAYS THINKING ABOUT THIS

390
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,376
CHALLENGE RIGHT HERE.

391
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,002
IT'S JUST TOUGH TO END THIS WAY.

392
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,713
>> Jeff: CAN YOU COMPARE THIS

393
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:39,383
TO SOME OF THE TOUGH THINGS

394
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,009
PROBABLY, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE

395
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,635
THINGS I HAD TO GO THROUGH MY

396
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,471
FIRST YEAR AT WEST POINT, ALWAYS

397
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:43,971
ON EDGE.

398
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:44,889
AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST

399
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,932
19 DAYS I'VE-- I'VE EXPERIENCED.

400
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,893
>> Jeff: REALLY?

401
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,852
>> YEAH.

402
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,896
THE SILVER LINING IF NOT FOR MY

403
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,191
BLINDSIDE I WOULDN'T HAVE SPENT

404
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,317
ANY DAYS WITH HER OUT HERE IN

405
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,153
THE GAME AND I GOT TO SPEND TWO

406
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,362
DAYS IN REDEMPTION ISLAND.

407
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:00,905
THIS WAS A LOT HARDER THAN I

408
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,531
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

409
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,158
>> Jeff: JOHN, AFTER 19 DAYS--

410
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,035
I KNOW IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT--

411
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,828
YOUR TIME IN THIS GAME IS OVER.

412
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,787
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

413
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,039
PUT YOUR BUFF IN THE URNSPD ON

414
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,665
THE WAY OUT.

415
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,711
>> GOOD JOB, JOHN.

416
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,045
( APPLAUSE )

417
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:16,879
>> Jeff: LAURA M., HOW DOES IT

418
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,046
FEEL?

419
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,006
>> GOOD.

420
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,966
I'M STILL IN THE GAME, LIKE IT

421
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,051
SHOULD BE.

422
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,136
AND THAT'S THE GLORY OF IT.

423
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,429
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LAURA,

424
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,806
BEFORE YOU OFFICIALLY RE-ENTER

425
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,851
THE GAME, YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE

426
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,354
CAN DROP YOUR BUFFS.

427
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,857
WE ARE MERGED.

428
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:43,113
>> WHOO-HOO.

429
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:43,864
>> Jeff: I'LL LET YOU PASS

430
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,576
THESE OUT, LAURA.

431
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,328
DROP YOUR OLD ONE PUT ON YOUR

432
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,329
NEW TRIBE COLOR.

433
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:56,460
>> AND IT SMELLS GOOD!

434
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,838
>> I TOLD YOU I'D BE BACK.

435
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,422
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE

436
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,590
BIT OF BUSINESS.

437
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,216
BECAUSE YOU WON THE DUEL, ARE

438
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,135
YOU IN CHARGE OF WHO GETS THE

439
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,929
CLUE TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

440
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,096
IDOL.

441
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,348
NOW, THE LAST SEVERAL HAVE BEEN

442
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:09,932
TOSSED RIGHT IN THE FIRE.

443
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,893
BUT GIVEN THAT WE ARE NOW

444
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,020
MERGED, MAYBE THIS HAS MORE

445
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:15,229
VALUE.

446
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,230
BEFORE YOU DECIDE ANYTHING, YOU

447
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,064
CAN GIVE THIS TO ANYBODY YOU

448
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,192
WANT WHO IS STILL IN THE GAME.

449
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,070
THAT NOW INCLUDES YOU.

450
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,739
I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS GOING

451
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:33,163
TO JOIN THE OTHERS IN THE FIRE.

452
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,708
ALL RIGHT, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD

453
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,083
OUT.

454
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:41,422
>> ALL RIGHT!

455
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,382
>> GLAD WE MADE IT.

456
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,509
>> AS IT STANDS NOW, MY STRATEGY

457
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,093
IS TO GO GALANG STRONG, THE

458
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,970
ORIGINAL GALANG, ME, GERVASE,

459
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,515
TYSON, MONCARKS TINA, PLUS VYTAS

460
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,099
AND KATIE.

461
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:52,725
THAT'S SEVEN.

462
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,059
THERE ARE 11 PEOPLE IN THE GAME.

463
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,061
WE HAVE A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE.

464
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:25,382
>> WHERE'S THE FOOD!

465
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,509
>> RED WINE!

466
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,677
>> SHOULD WE SET IT OUT?

467
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,512
>> LET'S SET IT ALL OUT.

468
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,140
>> YEAH, I WANT ONE OF THOSE

469
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:33,849
SALAMI SANDWICHES.

470
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,475
>> YEAH, GIRL.

471
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,018
>> WE HIT THE BEACH.

472
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,520
WE HAVE A PICNIC, THE MERGE

473
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:38,687
FEAST.

474
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,855
THERE'S WINE AND CHEESE AND

475
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:40,272
CRACKERS AND SALAMI.

476
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,900
AND I'M STUFFING MY FACE, BUT

477
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,360
THE WHOLE TIME I'M REALLY

478
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,527
THINKING, OKAY, WHAT CAN I DO

479
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,781
HERE TO MAKE SURE I STAY IN THE

480
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,031
NUMBERS?

481
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,157
>> CAN I HAVE A SALAMI, PLEASE?

482
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,409
>> OH, MY GOD, I'M SO HAPPY.

483
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,371
>> I CAN'T HANDLE A WHOLE LOT OF

484
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:55,621
SALAMI.

485
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,916
>> WE HAD FIVE SOILED, ME,

486
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,542
CALEB, TYSON, GERVASE, AND

487
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:00,709
CIERA.

488
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,504
AND NOW I'M THINKING, OKAY, IS

489
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,881
LAURA M. GOING TO COME WITH

490
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,175
CIERA OR IS LAURA M. GOING TO

491
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,969
PULL CIERA.

492
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:16,725
LAURA M., KATIE, AND IT COULD

493
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,518
HINGE ON LAURA.

494
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,060
ONCE THE MERGE HAMS, THIS IS

495
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,186
WHEN THE GAME STARTS.

496
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,063
THIS IS WHERE SURVIVOR REALLY

497
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,107
BECOMES SURVIVOR.

498
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,233
>> LAURA, HOW LONG COULD YOU

499
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,067
HAVE HUNG ON UP THERE?

500
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,694
>> FOREVER.

501
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,987
>> YOU WEREN'T TIRED AT ALL?

502
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:29,571
YOU DIDN'T LOOK LIKE YOU WERE.

503
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,991
>> MY THIGHS WERE HOLDING ON SO

504
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,992
HARD TO THAT THING.

505
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,036
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 19 DAYS I

506
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,579
GET TO PLAY WITH MY DAUGHTER.

507
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,748
MY PLAN IS US COUPLES HAVE TO

508
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,374
STAY TOGETHER.

509
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,166
THAT'S SIX RIGHT THERE.

510
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,085
I DEFINITELY DO NEED TO TALK TO

511
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:43,252
CIERA.

512
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,628
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO, A

513
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,296
LOT OF WORK TO DO, BUT I'M STILL

514
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,881
HERE AND I'M NOT GIVING UP.

515
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,507
>> LET'S START MAKING THE FLAG.

516
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,259
>> AND MAYBE WE SHOULD COME UP

517
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,137
WITH A NAME.

518
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,222
>> LET'S GO FOR A WALK.

519
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,098
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EXPECT IT

520
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:56,306
ANYWAY.

521
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,266
>> DO YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THE

522
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:57,433
BEACH?

523
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,560
>> I'M GOING TO TAKE HER DOWN

524
00:16:59,643 --> 00:16:59,810
THE BEACH.

525
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:00,227
>> OKAY.

526
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,561
>> ALL RIGHT.

527
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,690
>> SHOW HER THE GROUNDS.

528
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,358
>> IT ALL COMES DOWN TO LAURA M.

529
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,527
>> I KNOW.

530
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,987
>> AS LONG AS CIERA IS WORKING

531
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,154
HER.

532
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,238
>> I THINK SO.

533
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,241
WE'LL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEM.

534
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,576
>> LET'S GO DOWN ONE MORE.

535
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,286
>> OKAY.

536
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,078
>> PLAYING WITH YOUR LOVED ONE,

537
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,205
AND THEN MAKING IT TO THE MERGE,

538
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,124
I FEEL SO BLESSED.

539
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,334
BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE FACT

540
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,252
THAT MY MOM CAUSED SOME RIFFS

541
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,504
AND HAD SOME ENEMIES, CLEARLY,

542
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,089
BECAUSE THEY VOTED HER OUT.

543
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,008
AND IT'S ALL SHIFTED, AND WITH

544
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,676
MY MOM COME BACK IN THE GAME, IT

545
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,095
COULD REALLY HURT ME.

546
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,140
SO WHERE DO I START?

547
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,560
SO HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.

548
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,187
I'M IN AN ALLIANCE.

549
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,732
>> WITH-- PLEASE TELL ME CALEB

550
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,107
AND HAYDEN.

551
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:47,733
>> YES.

552
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,317
>> OH, GOOD.

553
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,277
>> HERE'S WHERE IT GETS SKETCHY.

554
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,820
YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE SKETCHY AND

555
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,822
HERE'S WHY.

556
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,407
BECAUSE IT WAS AN ALLIANCE

557
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,034
FORMED ON BEAM POOEM WITHOUT

558
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,202
LOVED ONES.

559
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,288
IT'S ME, CADEN, TYSON AND

560
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:01,497
GERVASE.

561
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,374
AND WE PROMISED IECH OTHER FINAL

562
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:04,833
FIVE.

563
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,834
DON'T TALK STRATEGY WITH

564
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,376
ANYBODY, NO ONE.

565
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:06,835
>> OKAY.

566
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,796
>> SO HERE'S THE THING, ARAS IS

567
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,296
NEXT TO GO.

568
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,255
I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY MOM IS ON

569
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,132
BOARD AND REALLY UNDERSTANDS HOW

570
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,259
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY IT.

571
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,763
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE TEACHER YOU,

572
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,306
YOU KNOW, TEACHING MY MOM THE

573
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,433
WAYS, THE WAYS OF THE TRIBE.

574
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,935
DON'T TOWK TAANYONE.

575
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,519
>> ME AND CIERA ARE THE PEOPLE

576
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,312
THAT ARE GOING TO DECIDE WANT

577
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,355
FATE OF EITHER THE COUPLES OR

578
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,981
THE FATE OF THE SINGLES.

579
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,441
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HERE

580
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,275
I WAS ON REDEMPTION ISLAND

581
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,486
THINKING THE GAME IS OVER, AND

582
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,237
NOW I'M IN A POWER POSITION IN

583
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,865
THIS GAME OF WHO'S GOING TO GO

584
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,032
HOME?

585
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:43,038
>> JUST DON'T PLAY HARD.

586
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,290
>> YOU GOING FOR A WALK, TYS?

587
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,168
>> YEAH.

588
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:48,585
OKAY, I'LL BE BACK.

589
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,088
YOU GOTTA ACT FAST COME MERGE

590
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,215
TIME, SO NOW THE ONLY FACTOR IN

591
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,258
THE GAME IS FINDING OUT WHERE

592
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,510
THE IMMUNITY IDOLS ARE.

593
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,428
WHEN THE TRIBE SWAP HAPPENED,

594
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,179
HAYDEN GAVE ME ALL THE INFO HE

595
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,558
KNEW ABOUT THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

596
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:02,724
IDOL.

597
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,144
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S AT THE

598
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,398
GIANT TREE ON THE WAY TO THE

599
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:17,197
WATERFALL.

600
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,699
OKAY.

601
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:23,537
THIS HAS TO BE THE SERPENT TREE.

602
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,873
THIS IS THE SERPENT.

603
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,416
SO MAYBE IF I DIG UNDERNEATH IT

604
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:45,434
OVER HERE.

605
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,484
TA-DA!

606
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,486
I'M DEFINITELY NOT SHARING THIS

607
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,322
WITH ANYBODY ELSE RIGHT NOW.

608
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,157
IF IT WORKS TO MY ADVANTAGE TO

609
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,366
SHARE IT WITH SOMEBODY IN MY

610
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,160
ALLIANCE TO PUSH SOMEBODY ELSE

611
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,244
OUT, THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO, BUT

612
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,913
RIGHT NOW, NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW

613
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:06,455
I HAVE IT.

614
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,248
I STEPPED ON THAT PROBABLY LIKE

615
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,207
20 TIMES.

616
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,667
LET'S SEE HOW SWEET IT IS.

617
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,335
I HOPE IT'S SOILED GOLD.

618
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,128
TRY IT ON.

619
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,797
MAKE SURE IT FITS.

620
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,006
HOORAY.

621
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,383
I HAVE NEVER HAD AN IDOL BEFORE

622
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,261
AND I'VE ALSO NEVER WON THE SHOW

623
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:21,470
BEFORE.

624
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,180
DO THOSE CORRELATE DIRECTLY WITH

625
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:23,722
ONE ANOTHER?

626
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,848
PROBABLY NOT, BUT AT LEAST THIS

627
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,684
IS A LITTLE MORE ADVANTAGE.

628
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,405
>> GOOD JOB, DUDE, YOU MADE IT.

629
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,115
YOU MADE THE MERGE.

630
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,951
>> SKIN OF MY TEETH, BRO.

631
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,785
>> I KNEW YOU WOULD.

632
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,912
>> I'M SO STOKED I GET TO PLAY

633
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,579
WITH ARAS.

634
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,872
HE IS MY BROTHER AND I LOVE HIM

635
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,290
AND I WANT TO GO DEEP IN THIS

636
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,458
GAME WITH HIM.

637
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,793
DUDE, WE HAVE A PATH AND IT IS

638
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,085
SO PERFECT.

639
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,252
>> IT IS SO PERFECT.

640
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,712
>> TINA AND KATIE, WE'RE SO IN

641
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:55,921
THERE.

642
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,296
>> I KNOW.

643
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,965
>> AND MONICA, EVEN THOUGH SHE

644
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,800
TALKS A LOT AND GETS AROUND, I

645
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,635
TOTALLY THINK SHE'S ON BOARD ITW

646
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:01,802
IT.

647
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,302
>> I THINK SO, TOO,.

648
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,930
>> AND WITH YOU AND GERKS RV.

649
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,514
>> AND TYSON IS OUR SEVEN.

650
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,891
>> DO WE EVEN NEED THE NOOED

651
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,100
THAT?

652
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,185
>> YEAH, WE DO.

653
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:10,769
TYSON-- DEFINITELY KEEP TYSON

654
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,019
AROUND.

655
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,269
>> REALLY?

656
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,938
>> YEAH.

657
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,481
>> WHAT IF HE GOES ON A RUN?

658
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,066
>> HE CAN'T.

659
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,069
HE'S GOT A BROKEN ARM.

660
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,405
>> WE LAID OUT OUR PLAN FOR THE

661
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:27,661
SEVEN-- TEEN AMONG GERVAS TYSON,

662
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,329
JRVE, AND ARAS AND MYSELF.

663
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,747
THERE ARE SEVEN OF US.

664
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,001
>> I DON'T TRUST LAURA M. AT ALL

665
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,044
I THINK SHE'S THE SCARIEST

666
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,713
PERSON IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW.

667
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,132
GETTING RID OF LAURA IS NOT

668
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,091
BECAUSE SHE WAS ON REDEMPTION

669
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:45,095
ISLAND AND BACK, BUT SHE IS THE

670
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:45,429
SAFEST PLAY.

671
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,180
EVERYONE FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE

672
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:47,681
WITH HER.

673
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,516
>> IF PEOPLE WERE SMART, THEY

674
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,435
WOULD MOBILIZE AGAINST US RIGHT

675
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,519
AWAY.

676
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,437
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO.

677
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,605
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET

678
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,649
LAURA OR CIERA.

679
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,400
>> "BLOOD VERSUS WATER" SHOULD

680
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:03,780
IN THE END BE CALLED VYTAS

681
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,200
VERSUS ARAS BECAUSE WE WOULD BE

682
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:07,784
STUPID RIGHT NOW NOT TO GET TO

683
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,660
THE END.

684
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,466
>> YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU

685
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,258
WHAT'S GOING ON?

686
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:23,717
>> YES.

687
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,968
HERE'S WHAT THEY'RE TELLING ME.

688
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:25,552
THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M

689
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,804
NUMBER 5 AND MONICA'S HAPPY TO

690
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,472
MAKE IT TO 5 BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T

691
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,724
HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL IN

692
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:30,932
WINNING.

693
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,851
>> OKAY, SO HERE'S WHAT I HAVE

694
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,310
SET UP.

695
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:33,727
>> OKAY.

696
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,520
>> ME AND GERVASE ARE TIGHT.

697
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,563
>> BUT IS HE GOING TO FLIP

698
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,440
BECAUSE GERVASE THINKS HE'S

699
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,233
FINAL THREE WITH ARAS AND TINA?

700
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:40,776
>> NO.

701
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,485
I NEED TO TELL MONICA ABOUT THE

702
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:45,489
PLAN TO GET ARAS OUT BECAUSE,

703
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,157
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO SHOW HER A

704
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,532
LITTLE LOVE.

705
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,408
YOU HAVE TO SHOW HER SOME

706
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,576
RESPECT.

707
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,577
JUST TO SOLIDIFY THE NUMBERS.

708
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,330
YOU'RE WITH US.

709
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,664
THAT'S THE MAJORITY.

710
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,208
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO STICK

711
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:56,458
WITH.

712
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,251
WE TAKE ARAS OUT FIRST AND THEN

713
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,836
START PLUCKING THEM OFF ONE BY

714
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,003
ONE.

715
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:00,545
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS--

716
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,464
>> HERE'S THE THING.

717
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,341
>> SHE JUST LIKES TO REPEAT THE

718
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,592
SAME IDEA OVER AND OVER AND OVER

719
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,302
AGAIN, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

720
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:07,886
RUDE TO HER BECAUSE I NEED TO

721
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,431
KEEP HER CLOSE.

722
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,642
>> THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS--

723
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,644
>> AT SOME POINT YOU JUST HAVE

724
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,855
TO BE, LIKE, "MONICA, SHUT UP."

725
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,441
>> ARE YOU SURE THAT GERVASE IS

726
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,318
WITH YOU?

727
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,654
>> I'M SURE GERVASE IS WITH ME.

728
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,488
>> YOU'RE SURE.

729
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,782
>> I'M SURE.

730
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,741
I'M JUST LIKE

731
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,450
( SIZE )

732
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,702
GIVE ME A RUSTY SPOON SO I CAN

733
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,538
DIG BOTH MY EYEBALLS OUT AND TRY

734
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,082
AND JAM IT THROUGH MY EYE SOCKET

735
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:37,958
INTO MY BRAIN.

736
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,417
IT'S TAKING ALL OF MY PATIENCE,

737
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:39,960
ALL OF IT.

738
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,838
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHERE ARE YOU

739
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,881
WITH ME.

740
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,800
>> WE'RE ANYTHING TO THE END.

741
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,008
>> OKAY.

742
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:47,592
THIS WAS OUR THING FROM THE

743
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:47,843
BEGINNING.

744
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,387
>> FROM THE BEGINNING.

745
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,304

GAME YOU ALREADY HAVE MADE A FEW

955
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,974
MISTAKES AND I'M MAKING SURE I

956
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,767
AM NOT GOING INTO A CHALLENGE

957
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,602
NEEDING IMMUNITY.

958
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,103
I DIDN'T NEED IMMUNITY TODAY BUT

959
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,813
I NEEDED TO BEAT MY BROTHER, AND

960
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:39,314
IT HAPPENED SO I'M HAPPY.

961
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,024
>> IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

962
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:41,649
>> THANK YOU.

963
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,150
>> MATCHES YOUR SHORTS.

964
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,694
>> MOVING FORWARD THE BIGGEST

965
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,070
THREAT IN THE GAME IS ARAS AND

00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:46,195
I.

967
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,323
WE HAVE THIS BEACH LOCKED, AND I

968
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,324
WOULD BE SURPRISED IF ANYBODY

969
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,617
HAS THE GUTS TO DO ANYTHING

970
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,701
ABOUT IT.

971
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,828
>> I DON'T TRUST LAURA M..

00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:54,996
WE GOTTA GET HER OUT.

973
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,496

979
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,300
>> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NINE PIECES

00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,801
WORKING SOMEWHAT IN UNISON.

981
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,927
EVERYONE THINKS THEY'RE WITH US.

982
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,596
ALL THE BOYS ARE VOTING FOR

983
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,722

00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,016
TINA, MONCARKS AND KATIE VOTING

00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,434
FOR CIERA.

986
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,061
IN CASE LAURA M. HAS THE HIDDEN

987
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,355
IMMUNITY IDOL, IT GETS FLUSHED

988
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,522
AND CIERA GOES HOME.

989
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,068
AND IF NOT, THEN LAURA M. GOES

990
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:25,276
HOME.

991
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,862
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL INTENDING?

992
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:28,112
ALL RIGHT.

993
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:28,988
AND ARE YOU OKAY WITH IT?

994
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,406
>> YEAH.

995
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:38,414
IT'S A GAME.

996
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,542
>> HERE'S WHAT I'M SCARED ABOUT.

997
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,002
>> DO YOU THINK ARAS HAS THE

998
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:43,211
IDOL?

999
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,587
>> AND HERE'S THE ONLY REASON I

1000
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,838
SAY THAT BECAUSE ON MY SEASON

1001
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,507
LAST TIME, RUSSELL HAD IT.

1002
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,175
>> NO, NO, WAIT.

1003
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,426
HE'S SO COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW.

1004
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,135
>> ARAS?

1005
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,845
>> IS HE COMFORTABLE BECAUSE HE

1006
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,596
HAS AN IDOL?

1007
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,849
>> IN MY EVERYDAY LIFE, I'M MY

1008
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,976
MOM'S BIGGEST CHEERLEADER, GO,

1009
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,395
MOM, GO, MOM.

1010
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,146
THAT'S MY NATURAL INSTINCT.

1011
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,399
BUT MY GAME SIDE IS SAYING,

1012
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,484
OKAY, LAURA, THINK ABOUT.

1013
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,985
BMAYOU'RE DOING.

1014
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,237
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY WE THROW FOUR

1015
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,740
VOTES-- HEAR ME OUT-- TO LAURA

1016
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,117
AND THREE TO ARAS.

1017
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,742
HERE'S WHY.

1018
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,703
WE GO TO TRIBAL, AND LET'S SAY

1019
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,372
WE GO AND ARAS PULLS OUT THE

1020
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:19,580
IDOL.

1021
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,082
>> IT'S THE WEIRDEST THING.

1022
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,291
I'VE NEVER FELT IT BEFORE.

1023
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,126
IT'S A STRUGGLE.

1024
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,378
AND I WANT TO LISTEN TO MY MOM,

1025
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,587
DO WHAT MY MOM SAYS.

1026
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,922
BUT ON THE SAME HAND, I'M HERE

1027
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,674
TO PLAY MY GAME.

1028
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,092
>> THROW FOUR TINA'S WAY, THREE

1029
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,051
ARAS' WAY.

1030
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,721
ARAS PLAYS THE IDOL.

1031
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,596
TINA'S OUT OF THE GAME.

1032
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:46,649
NOW WE HAVE EVEN MORE NUMBERS.

1033
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,317
>> IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE ARAS HAS

1034
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,777
THE PLAN, WHICH IS THE MEN ARE

1035
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,612
ALL GOING TO VOTE FOR LAURA, AND

1036
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,156
ALL THE GIRLS ARE GOING TO VOTE

1037
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:53,948
FOR CIERA.

1038
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,410
>> LET ME GRAB ONE OF THOSE.

1039
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,870
>> WE'RE GOOD STILL.

1040
00:33:58,953 --> 00:33:59,245
>> THAT'S COOL.

1041
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,872
>> THE PLAN WITH TYSON IS THAT

1042
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,416
ME, TYSON, MONICA, HAYDEN,

1043
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,710
CALEB, CIERA, AND LAURA M.VOTE

1044
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,252
FOR ARAS.

1045
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,337
>> YOU GO WITH THE PLAN.

1046
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:08,671
>> KING ARAS.

1047
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,088
>> SIR ARAS.

1048
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:15,511
>> SIR ARAS.

1049
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,180
>> IT JUST STARTS TO GET A

1050
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,473
LITTLE TRICKY NOW BECAUSE I'M

1051
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,223
NOT SO SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS ON

1052
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,434
THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN

1053
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,310
SAY ONE THING TO YOUR FACE BUT

1054
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,562
BEHIND YOUR BACK THEY COULD SAY

1055
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:24,896
WHATEVER ELSE.

1056
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,814
I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW IT

1057
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,398
ALL SHAKES OUT.

1058
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:31,027
I THINK I HAVE-- AND I KNOW HOW

1059
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,361
IT WAS GOING TO FALL OUT PUT I

1060
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,196
COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG, WHICH IS

1061
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:53,674
THE CRAZY PART ABOUT THIS GAME.

1062
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,138
>> Jeff: SO, TYSON, LET ME SEE

1063
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,723
IF I CAN SET THIS UP.

1064
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,182
WE MERGE.

1065
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,309
WE HAVE THE ORIGINAL TRIBAL

1066
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:03,518
LINES.

1067
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,811
WE HAVE THE NEW TRIBAL LINES

1068
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,770
FROM THE SWITCH.

1069
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,189
AND-- TOP OF ALL OF THIS,

1070
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:08,731
THERE'S BLOOD VERSUS WATER.

1071
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,818
IN THIS CASE THREE, PAIRS OF

1072
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,276
TRUE BLOOD.

1073
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,985
>> CORRECT.

1074
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,654
AND I'M SURE THE COUPLES WANT TO

1075
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,238
WORK TOGETHER AS FAR AS THEY

1076
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:15,404
CAN.

1077
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,322
>> Jeff: YOU ARE SURE?

1078
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,908
>> WELL, IF MY BROTHER WERE

1079
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,117
HERE, I'D WANT TO WORK WITH HIM

1080
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,994
AS LONG AS I COULD.

1081
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,413
>> Jeff: ARAS, IS THAT A FAIR

1082
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:24,705
STATEMENT?

1083
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,915
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY FAIR.

1084
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,375
BUT RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE 11

1085
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:27,667
PEOPLE HERE.

1086
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,669
THAT MEANS SIX PEOPLE HAVE TO

1087
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,837
COME TOGETHER TONIGHT.

1088
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,171
VYTAS AND I CAN'T JUST TRUST

1089
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,924
EACH OTHER AND BE LIKE, COOL,

1090
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:35,258
WE'RE FINE.

1091
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,717
WE HAVE TO FIND FOUR OTHER

1092
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,803
PEOPLE WHO WE REALLY TROWFT GET

1093
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,304
THE MAJORITY IN THIS VOTE

1094
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,472
TONIGHT SO I THINK IT'S MORE

1095
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,015
ABOUT MAKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

1096
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,267
EVERYONE THAN JUST VYTAS AND I.

1097
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,352
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, IF WE LOOK AT

1098
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,645
THE NUMBERS, THERE ARE THREE

1099
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,354
PAIRS OF LOVED ONES-- THAT WOULD

1100
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,189
BE SIX-- AND THERE ARE FIVE

1101
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,399
INDIVIDUALS.

1102
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,358
THE ONLY HICCUP TO THAT IS ONE

1103
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,777
OF THOSE PAIRS INVOLVES LAURA

1104
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,987
WHO WAS VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME

1105
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,989
AND JUST GOT BACK IN, AND IF YOU

1106
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,323
LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

1107
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,658
"SURVIVOR" THAT PERSON OFTEN IS

1108
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,284
VOTED OUT AT THE VERY FIRST

1109
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,578
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHICH WOULD BE

1110
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:03,786
TONIGHT.

1111
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,328
>> THERE'S NO DOUBT, JEFF.

1112
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,207
IN PAST SEASONS YOU COME OFF

1113
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,584
REDEMPTION, YOU TEND TO HEAD

1114
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:09,917
RIGHT BACK.

1115
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,295
>> Jeff: DOES THAT POTENTIALLY

1116
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,964
MAKE LAURA AND CIERA SWING VOTES

1117
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,340
BECAUSE SHE MAY NOT BE WELCOMED

1118
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:16,757
BACK IN THIS GAME?

1119
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,260
>> SURE, AND NOT JUST LAURA AND

1120
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:19,427
CIERA.

1121
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,095
YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THE PAIRS ARE

1122
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,305
GOING TO WORK TOGETHER SO ANY

1123
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,347
ONE OF THE PAIRS COULD

1124
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,807
POTENTIALLY BE A SWING.

1125
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,392
>> Jeff: KATIE, WHY WOULD THAT

1126
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,686
MAKE SENSE IF YOU AND YOUR MOM

1127
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,062
COULD MOVE OVER TO THE

1128
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,230
INDIVIDUAL SIDE AND MAKE IT A

1129
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:31,898
7-4 GAME.

1130
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,316
>> RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW WHO

1131
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,692
FIT WOULD.

1132
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,235
WE CAME INTO THE MERGE WITH AN

1133
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,195
IDEA WHO WE WANT TO WORK WITH

1134
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,031
AND I DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE

1135
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,490
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

1136
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,700
>> Jeff: KATIE IS BASICALLY

1137
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,326
SAYING, NOT SO MUCH.

1138
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,493
I'M GOING TO STICK WITH THE

1139
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,787
LOVED ONES AND IF THAT'S TRUE,

1140
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,372
AND LAURA AND CIERA BITE ON

1141
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,124
THAT, IT'S GAME OVER FOR THE

1142
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:50,416
INDIVIDUALS.

1143
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,084
>> RIGHT, IT'S DEFINITELY A

1144
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:52,960
THREATENING THING TO SEE THERE

1145
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,921
ARE SIX OF THEM AND FIVE

1146
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,422
INDIVIDUALS BUT YOU COULD DO

1147
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,423
THAT WITH THE GUYS, TOO.

1148
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,966
THERE ARE SIX GUYS AND FIVE

1149
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,175
GIRLS.

1150
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,384
IN THE END, IT'S WHO YOU TRUST

1151
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:00,885
THE MOST.

1152
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,094
IF YOU TRUST THE PAIR THE MOST,

1153
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:02,470
YOU GO WITH THEM.

1154
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,056
IF NOT, YOU FIND A DIFFERENT

1155
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:05,264
ROAD.

1156
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:05,890
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

1157
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,350
WAYS YOU COULD CUT PIE, AND I

1158
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,018
HOPE TO GET THE LARGEST PORTION

1159
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,187
OF THE PIE, JEFF.

1160
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,520
( LAUGHTER ).

1161
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,396
>> Jeff: LAURA, WHAT'S YOUR

1162
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,023
BEST PLAY RIGHT NOW?

1163
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:14,982
KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE A TARGET

1164
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,651
ON YOUR BACK SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU

1165
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,526
WERE ALREADY VOTED OUT ONCE?

1166
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,153
>> YEAH, IT'S LIKE THE KID

1167
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:21,072
THAT'S BEEN HOME SICK WITH

1168
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,531
CHICKEN POX FOR THE LAST TWO

1169
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,533
WEEKS AND YOU FINALLY COME TO

1170
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,952
SCHOOL AND NOBODY WANTS TO PLAY

1171
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:26,953
WITH YOU.

1172
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,245
THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A LOVED

1173
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,081
ONE HERE IS THE STUFF I CAN

1174
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,540
FILTER THROUGH CIERA.

1175
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,334
SHE A GREAT SOCIAL PLAYER.

1176
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,377
I LOVE THE FACT THEY CAN GO TO

1177
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,588
MY DAUGHTER AND SAY, "CIERA, I

1178
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:37,922
NEED ADVICE."

1179
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,799
AND MY DAUGHTER IS PUTTING ME IN

1180
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,007
CHECK.

1181
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:40,716
IT'S AMAZING.

1182
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,426
>> Jeff: CIERA, IS THAT A ROLE

1183
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,594
REVERSAL OR IS THAT HOW IT'S

1184
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,095
ALWAYS BEEN?

1185
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,055
>> NO OORKTS A TOTAL REVERSAL

1186
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:46,722
OUT HERE.

1187
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,349
IT'S FUNNY, I'LL FIND MYSELF

1188
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,310
BEING LIKE, "MOM, RELAX."

1189
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,396
"LET'S JUST ENJOY OURSELVES."

1190
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,981
AND SHE'LL LOOK AT ME, "WHAT DO

1191
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,148
I DO?"

1192
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,401
AND I SAY, "JUST CALM DOWN

1193
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,153
BECAUSE YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT."

1194
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:01,737
>> Jeff: GERVASE WHAT, DO YOU

1195
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,116
THINK WILL BE DIFFERENT AFTER

1196
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:05,491
TONIGHT'S VOTE.

1197
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,784
>> I THINK FOR THE SMART

1198
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,785
PLAYERS, NOTHING.

1199
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,120
IT'S FOOLISH TO ACT CRAZY.

1200
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,746
YOU HAVE TO STAY CALM EVERY

1201
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,164
SECOND OF EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY

1202
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:12,665
HOUR AFFECTS THIS GAME.

1203
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,292
IT COULD CHANGE LIKE THAT.

1204
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,877
SO YOU HAVE TO BE READY WHEN IT

1205
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,044
DOES.

1206
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,547
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

1207
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,424
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1208
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,467
TO VOTE.

1209
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:34,145
CALEB, YOU'RE UP.

1210
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,521
>> WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE THE

1211
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:44,488
BEGINNING, BUT I'M SORRY.

1212
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,783
>> THIS IS MY POWER MOVE IN THIS

1213
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:47,992
GAME.

1214
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,535
I LOVE YOU LIKE A BROTHER, BUT

1215
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:53,205
IT'S JUST HOW IT IS.

1216
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,588
>> I VOTED YOU DOWN ONCE.

1217
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,882
I MIGHT AS WELL VOTE YOU DOWN

1218
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:18,230
TWICE.

1219
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,984
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1220
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:28,574
VOTES.

1221
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,993
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1222
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:31,952
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1223
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,621
PLAY TNOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO

1224
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,917
DO SO.

1225
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,376
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1226
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:39,835
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1227
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,420
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1228
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,463

1229
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:42,755

YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

WERE QUESTIONS COMING INTO

1269
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,890
TRIBAL COUNCIL, THERE'S

1270
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,433
CERTAINLY A LITTLE CLARITY NOW

1271
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,309
THAT IT'S OVER.

1272
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:18,726
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1280
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,212
JURY VOTES YOU'LL NEVER GET

1281
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,546
EXPWHRT GAME GETS UGLY.

1282
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,006
>> VENGEANCE IS GOING TO BE MINE

1283
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,174
AT SOME POINT.

1284
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,634
>> Jeff: JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT

1285
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,719
IT COULDN'T GET NEWSCAST YEAR.

1286
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,887
THERE'S A FOOD EATING

1287
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,179
COMPETITION.

1288
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,891
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1289
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,648
>> I'M STILL SHOCKED A LITTLE

1290
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:05,940
BIT.

1291
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,608
THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED

1292
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,609
"SURVIVOR" I NEVER GOT VOTED

1293
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,610
OUT.

1294
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,570
SO TO GET VOTED OUT WAS A NEW

1295
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,072
EXPERIENCE FOR ME.

1296
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,615
I THINK THE BIGGEST PAIN FOR ME

1297
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,825
IS VYTAS IS IN A REALLY TOUGH

1298
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:17,284
POSITION NOW.

1299
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,953
