4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,507
The tribes were mixed up.

00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,675
>> "Fei Long, choose the two

6
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,676
warriors from Zhan Hu who you

feel can best help to strengthen

your tribe."

10
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:15,515
to move to the Fei Long tribe.

13
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,226

14
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,436
>> JEFF: Aaron and James had to

15
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,812
move to the Zhan Hu tribe.

16
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,313
>> What's going on, guys?

17
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,148
>> JEFF: At the new Fei Long,

18
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,316
Sharea and Frosti were

19
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,234
outnumbered.

20
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,110
>> This is a dangerous place for

21
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,069
me.

22
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,195
Things are really messed up now.

23
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,238
>> JEFF: But they quickly

24
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,197
noticed that Jean-Robert was on

25
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,284
the outs.

26
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,827
>> I know.

27
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,453
>> That just makes me so much

28
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,287
more comfortable knowing that

29
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,414
there's somebody here they

30
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,040
already have problems with.

31
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,375
>> JEFF: Meanwhile, Todd

32
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,418
continued the search for the

33
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,335
hidden immunity idol.

34
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,837
>> "Waste no more time searching

35
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,921
the ground."

36
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,922
>> Right now, I'm kind of

37
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,007
wandering around the camp, like,

38
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,134
with my head in the sky.

39
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,343
>> JEFF: At the new Zhan Hu,

40
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,470
Jaime and Peih-Gee hatched a

41
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,846
plan to lose immunity challenges

42
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:09,235
on purpose.

43
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,361
>> JEFF: And at the immunity

44
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,989
challenge, Jaime tossed away a

45
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,157
puzzle piece...

46
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,366
>> They have to fit on, y'all.

47
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,951
They have to fit on like this.

48
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:17,994
>> JEFF: ...barely disguising

49
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,037
her effort to throw the

50
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,121
challenge.

51
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,456
Fei Long wins immunity!

52
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,209
At tribal council, the plan was

53
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,586
uncovered.

54
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,170
So you threw the challenge.

55
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,255
>> Yes, sir.

56
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,882
>> JEFF: And Aaron was voted

57
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,257
out...

58
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,258
Fifth person voted out of

59
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,135
<i>Survivor: China,</i> Aaron.

60
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,805
...leaving James on the Zhan Hu

61
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,181
chopping block.

TELEVISION

65
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,464
>> Good morning, James.

66
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,387
>> I definitely feel confident

67
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,764
about throwing the challenge and

68
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,224
getting Aaron off the game.

69
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,600
He was one of the most powerful

70
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,102
players, and suddenly we had

71
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:24,686
full control of him, and we

72
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,397
still have that over James.

73
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,691
If we throw the next immunity

74
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,442
challenge, James is going to be

75
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,112
gone.

76
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:34,737
Best possible scenario, we merge

77
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,573
at that point.

78
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,282
And if that happens, we'll be

79
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,450
able to reconnect with Frosti

80
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,535
and Sherea, still... if they're

81
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,747
still on the same page with us.

82
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,374
>> Aaron's gone.

83
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,585
And I'm just at their mercy

84
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,503
right now.

85
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,048
The best thing for me to do

86
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,758
is to keep them rested so in

87
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,385
competitions, there's no excuse

88
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,845
of anybody being tired.

89
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,929
It makes me look good in the

90
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,055
long run.

91
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,265
They're going to keep me around.

92
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,224
So I'm trying to deal with it

93
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,267
and make it work.

94
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,268
Because if they throw another

95
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,687
challenge, I'm gone.

96
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:30,645
(<i> snoring</i> )

97
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,106
>> I have to tell you something.

98
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,565
It has to stay between us.

99
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,568
There's a hidden immunity idol

100
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,696
here at our camp.

101
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,031
When we kidnap people, they give

102
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:42,407
us clues.

103
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,492
And I've gotten them all.

104
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,910
And I wasn't going to tell you

105
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,370
until I found it, but I haven't

106
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,288
found it yet.

107
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,582
I have three clues.

108
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,593
>> Todd approached me and he

109
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,428
told me that he had three clues

110
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,765
to the immunity idol, which I

111
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,559
was kind of shocked because I

112
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,560
didn't know about any hidden

113
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,603
immunity idol.

114
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,022
So we're going to do everything

115
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,357
we can to find that idol today.

116
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,484
We have to.

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,489
>> If we win reward today, we

118
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,866
are bringing over either Aaron

119
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,992
or James, whoever is left,

120
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,326
because they're going to give us

121
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,910
a clue as to where that hidden

122
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,288
immunity idol is, and Amanda and

123
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:30,872
I will have control in this

124
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,624
game.

125
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,596
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

126
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,815
Fei Long getting your first look

127
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,399
at the new Zhan Hu.

128
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,525
Aaron voted out at the last

129

tribal council.

130
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,451
You guys ready to get to today's

131
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,328
reward challenge?

132
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,287
>> Yes, sir.

133
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,663
>> JEFF: For today's challenge,

134
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,082
one person from each tribe will

135
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:14,624
race through this abandoned

136
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,919
Chinese village to find a tribe-

137
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:18,628
colored puzzle board.

138
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,922
You'll untie it, bring it back

139
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,048
to your mat, the next person

140
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,465
goes.

141
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,218
Once you've collected all eight

142
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,011
boards, you'll use them to

143
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:27,637
decode a phrase made famous by

144
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,516
Confucius.

145
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,184
First tribe to solve it

146
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,102
correctly wins reward.

147
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:34,894
Want to know what you're playing

148
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:35,603
for?

149
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:35,812
>> Yes.

150
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,396
>> Yes.

151
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,272
>> JEFF: The winning tribe will

152
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,273
be taken to a nearby island that

153
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,150
is home to a tea house.

154
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,528
You'll have access to a bath,

155
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,904
shower, chance to get clean,

156
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:45,571
plenty of soap, towels.

157
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,157
You will have two Western

158
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,325
toilets, something you haven't

159
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,035
had in a while.

160
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,703
Plenty of Charmin, ultra-strong.

161
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,708
And because it's a tea house,

162
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,001
you'll have some tea and a light

163
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,044
snack.

164
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,003
In addition, the winning tribe

165
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,338
will kidnap one person from the

166
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,422
losing tribe.

167
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,423
That person will stay with them

168
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:04,924
until the next immunity

169
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,425
challenge.

170
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,385
Big enough stakes?

171
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,386
>> Love it.

172
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,970
>> JEFF: Fei Long, you have

173
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,429
three extra members.

174
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,305
You're sitting three people out.

175
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,265
Keeping in mind you cannot sit

176
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,349
out the same people in back-to-

177
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:13,891
back challenges, who are the

178
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,269
three people sitting out?

179
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:16,811
Denise, Amanda, Courtney,

180
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,396
sitting this one out.

181
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,230
I'll give everybody else a

182
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,106
minute to strategize and we'll

183
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,482
get started.

184
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,693
Here we go, for reward.

185
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,236
Survivors ready?

186
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,029
Go.

187
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,406
James and Jean-Robert moving

188
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,491
from room to room.

189
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,828
>> What in the world?

190
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,705
>> JEFF: Got to get the planks

191
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,623
untied and race back before the

192
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,794
next person can go.

193
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,006

We are tied, seven planks each.

puzzle.

269
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,112
It is a phrase made famous by

270
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,197
Confucius.

Zhan Hu, trying to catch up.

277
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,212

Frosti getting excited.

284
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,889
He thinks he's on to something.

285
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,974
Fei Long thinks they have

286
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,517
something.

287
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,143
Trying to figure out what it is.

288
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,770
>> Where's the O?

289
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,063
Where's the one with the O on

290
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:47,980

puzzle part of a challenge.

295

>> Tell me when.

296
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,820
I can't see.

297
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,825
>> Is that right?

298
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,201
>> We've got it.

299

single step."

302
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,165
Fei Long wins reward!

303
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,338
All right, first order of

304
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,255
business: Fei Long, you are

305
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,131
kidnapping one member from Zhan

306
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,132
Hu.

307
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,425
They will stay with you until

308
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,676
the next immunity challenge,

309
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,135
which means they will

310
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,678
participate in this reward with

311
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:19,929
you.

312
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,806
Who you getting?

313
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,932
>> Bring him back, baby.

314
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,974
>> Come back, James.

315
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,643
Come on home.

316
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,061
Come home for a night, son.

317
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,314
Haven't seen you smile like that

318
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,274
in a minute.

319
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,735
>> JEFF: Zhan Hu, got nothing

320
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,487
for you.

321
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,488
Grab your stuff, head back to

322
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,864
camp.

323
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,036
James, this is for you.

324
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,996
It says "open in private."

325
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,456
That's what it means.

326
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,499
Even though are you friendly

327
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:48,874
with these guys.

328
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,001
Fei Long, congratulations.

329
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:51,752
This is yours, and you are

330
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,962
heading to your reward.

331
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,921
A boat is waiting for you.

332
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,091
Get your stuff, head on out.

333
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,984
>> When Jeff announced what the

334
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,735
reward was at the challenge,

335
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,319
there was excitement on the

336
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:17,862
team.

337
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,779
We're going to go to a tea house

338
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,822
and some refreshment.

339
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,907
That's what he said, "Tea house,

340
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,077
some refreshment and showers."

341
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,829
But when we got to this place,

342
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,206
it was like a little sweet spot

343
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,833
in the middle of nowhere.

344
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,126
The view was amazing.

345
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,253
I mean, everybody on the tribe

346
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,839
was just so happy.

347
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,882
>> Hello.

348
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,174
>> Hello.

349
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,550
>> Hello.

350
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,301
>> Welcome to the Charmin Tea

351
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,051
House.

352
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,094
>> Come in and have some tea.

353
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,888
>> Oh, my god!

354
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,182
>> Wow!

355
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,725
>> Oh, my gosh!

356
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,767
>> No!

357
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,727
>> Oh, my god!

358
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,520
>> Yeah!

359
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:57,151
>> Oh, my god!

360
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,904
>> Oh, my gosh, sugar!

361
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,240
>> They sit us down and they

362
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,284
give us tea, and then they bring

363
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,660
out little snacks, and we're all

364
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,621
so happy to be there.

365
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:08,996
Oh!

366
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,165
It was so good!

367
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,584
>> Oh, yeah.

368
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,044
Oh, yeah!

369
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,255
>> Okay.

370
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,425
>> Yeah!

371
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,843
What a great challenge to win.

372
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,221
This is ridiculous.

373
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,931
>> Oh, my god!

374
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,933
>> Oh, my god, you have a brush!

375
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,976
>> This is so nice!

376
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,980
>> Isn't it, though?

377
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,065
>> For real.

378
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,233
This is the best reward.

379
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,651
>> I'd like my watermelon in the

380
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:38,984
tub, please.

381
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,987
>> Oh, my god!

382
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,280
>> Yeah!

383
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,240
>> Oh, this is the best day

384
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,157
ever.

385
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,952
>> I won't lie to you, Frosti

386
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,453
and James.

387
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,704
That tub looks the most

388
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,664
attractive to jump into right

389
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,666
now.

390
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,043
That tub right there.

391
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,878
>> I am so happy right now.

392
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,090
>> I tried my best to be as far

393
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,300
away from Jean-Robert in the

394
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,511
bathtub as could possibly happen

395
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,845
in that place.

396
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,138
He had the one on the far end,

397
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,306
I took the one on the other far

398
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,224
end.

399
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,350
He's kind of gross.

400
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,017
Every single part of me wants to

401
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,936
see Jean-Robert go.

402
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,312
I just don't like him.

403
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,189
He's a horrible person.

404
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,028
>> Oh, there we go!

405
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,446
We've got some butt action

406
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,031
happening!

407
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:26,991
>> Whoo!

408
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:27,908
>> Yeah!

409
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,284
>> Yeah, James!

410
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:28,909
>> Don't tease me, James!

411
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,037
Don't tease me!

412
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,958
>> James has such a nice butt.

413
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,419
He was in the shower, lathering

414
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,712
up.

415
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,005
He's stripping down, and none of

416
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,006
us cared.

417
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,464
He has a nice butt.

418
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,090
I mean, he might as well show it

419
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,342
off.

420
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,553
>> Why y'all messing with me?

421
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,778
>> I'll speak for myself.

422
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,239
I'm tired of losing.

423
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,598
>> We're so into keeping Sherea

424
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,099
Frosti, Erik, Peih-Gee and I

425
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,434
together.

426
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,060
We thought we would do anything

427
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,103
to save them-- we'd throw a

428
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,813
challenge to save them.

429
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,315
We did it, you know?

430
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,399
But Frosti won't make eye

431
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,317
contact with us.

432
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,401
We don't know if he's changed

433
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,486
his mind and switched over with

434
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,862
them.

435
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,404
You know, everything's just

436
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,989
unknown, so it's really hard to

437
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,990
deal with, especially when

438
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,116
there's just three of us here

439
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,951
and there's so many over there.

440
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,952
>> Now I'm not sure about Frosti

441
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,204
and Sherea, because that flips

442
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,623
everything.

443
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,086
>> I mean, we have three right

444
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,003
here, three strong.

445
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:03,337
That's great.

446
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,298
>> But it's not enough.

447
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,809
>> This the best reward yet.

448
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,935
>> It's so nice to clean my

449
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:18,143
feet.

450
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:23,524
This is the life.

451
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,609
>> You know, sometimes

452
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,152
throughout this game, I feel

453
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,446
like I am the only one playing.

454
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,740
So I knew right away when we

455
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,950
kidnapped James that I would

456
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,284
approach him.

457
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,226
>> "In this sealed tube is a

458
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,310
clue to the hidden immunity

459
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,603
idol.

460
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,730
You must give this to a member

461
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,355
of this tribe before you rejoin

462
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,482
your own."

463
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,234
Cool.

464
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,527
I hope it's worth it.

465
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,070
I need something to save me.

466
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,282
I'm in a bad spot right now.

467
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,533
Todd is the cornerstone to all

468
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,159
the alliances on this tribe, so

469
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,661
I'm going to roll with Todd and

470
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,288
roll the old dice and maybe it

471
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,706
will come up right.

472
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,874
If not, I'm pretty much gone

473
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,375
anyway, so I have to do it.

474
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,153
>> "There are four that surround

475
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,696
it, and four much the same.

476
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,239
The one etched finer could

477
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,449
salvage the game."

478
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,451
I know what they're talking

479
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,827
about.

480
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,454
It's those stupid bats above the

481
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,956
freakin' thing.

482
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,641
>> I went over where we thought

483
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,850
the idol would be, and I was

484
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,810
just hitting off shingles so

485
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,269
people didn't know what I was

486
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,562
doing.

487
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,563
And then Todd comes over...

488
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,816
>> Knock those down.

489
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,446
>> He gets up there, and he

490
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,657
starts pulling on the thing.

491
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,877
>> All of a sudden, Frosti comes

492
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,962
running over and climbs up, so I

493
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:50,546
go into panic mode of, "He's

494
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,381
going to find out.

495
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,382
He's going to see this!"

496
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,258
And Amanda's like, "Get down,

497
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:54,800
Frosti, get down, Frosti,"

498
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,511
because she knows about it.

499
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,684
And I'm telling him to get down,

500
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,310
and I started panicking, and...

501
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,154
Hey, hey, hey!

502
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:16,572
Wait, wait, wait!

503
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,449
>> What?

504
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,493
>> All I could think was Frosti,

505
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,079
Frosti, no!

506
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,009
>> This has to be the worst way

507
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,927
in history of getting an

508
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,804
immunity idol.

509
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,972
Like, honestly, in front of

510
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:42,514
everybody, Todd's yelling.

511
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,058
He's so impatient.

512
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:45,851
I knew something like that was

513
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,895
going to happen.

514
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,661
>> Being there when they got the

515
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,996
idol cements my place in their

516
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,455
little group.

517
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,457
I'm there for sure.

518
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,625
Frosti's in.

519
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,919
In!

520
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,636
>> James came down.

521
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,720
I gave him the idol, and I told

522
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,096
him what needs to happen.

523
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,139
This is it.

524
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,015
>> Yeah.

525
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:25,766
>> You've just got to lose the

526
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,143
game.

527
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,771
>> So if James takes that idol,

528
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,564
loses immunity, they vote for

529
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,274
him, but he uses the idol to get

530
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,361
rid of Jaime, we sever the tie

531
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,779
between her and Erik.

532
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,030
Hopefully, at ten we'll merge,

533
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,448
and we'll still have our numbers

534
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,367
to go strong into the merge.

535
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,035
Now, here's the way it works.

536
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,495
Everybody votes.

537
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,246
You stand up and say, "Jeff, I

538
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:48,872
have the hidden immunity idol."

539
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,333
All of your votes are immune.

540
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,251
The person you vote for is gone.

541
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,211
>> Cool.

542
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,129
>> You can make that Jaime.

543
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,422
>> I cannot stop smiling.

544
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,674
And it's all good, because I'm

545
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,716
not going anywhere.

546
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,300
I have the immunity idol.

547
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,095
It's all good, baby.

548
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,179
>> I don't know if the clues are

549
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,263
the same as theirs, but they

550
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:05,514
might be.

551
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,516
The second you get to camp,

552
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,435
their camp, you run up and you

553
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,728
grab it off.

554
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,771
>> Cool.

555
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,647
I was going to do that anyway.

556
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,523
>> But do it without them

557
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,607
noticing.

558
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,275
>> I'm the only one with real

559
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,859
access to the other immunity

560
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,527
idol at the other tribe.

561
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,029
So now all I have to do is stay

562
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,571
focused, keep my head in the

563
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,448
game, lose the immunity

564
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,783
challenge, get the other idol.

565
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,951
Now I have both of them.

566
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,035
I mean, it's going to be

567
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,995
wonderful.

568
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:28,954
I'm having a great time.

569
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,832
>> This saved our asses.

570
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:46,638
>> Jaime, all right.

571
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,307
>> Do you know how?

572
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,890
I found the hidden immunity

573
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,225
idol.

574
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,226
>> You found it?

575
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:51,810
>> I gave it to James for them

576
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,438
to lose and get rid of Jaime.

577
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,106
So we still have our numbers.

578
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,232
>> How did you find it?

579
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,191
>> See that empty square up

580
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:58,942
there?

581
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,693
>> No way, just right there in

582
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,444
front of everybody.

583
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,363
>> Yeah.

584
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,364
>> Okay.

585
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:04,906
>> James knows to throw the

586
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,574
challenge.

587
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,533
>> I can't believe it.

588
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,451
Here it was sitting right in

589
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,410
front of us at camp the whole

590
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,287
darn time.

591
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,621
>> So I will be doing my best,

592
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,873
as I always give 110%, because

593
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,457
that's the only way I know how

594
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,587
to go.

595
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,631
>> Me telling Courtney and

596
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,050
Denise about the hidden immunity

597
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,633
idol helped them realize that

598
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,469
they had to try harder for

599
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,429
immunity today, especially if

600
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,889
they're fighting to lose, which

601
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,807
we don't even know is the case.

602
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,810
>> Over at Zhan Hu, I'm pretty

603
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,187
much a dead man walking.

604
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,605
But now I have the upper hand.

605
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,191
They think they're safe-- wrong.

606
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,943
I'll be able to get them.

607
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,159
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

608
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,963
So James, time to head back to

609
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,548
your tribe, Zhan Hu.

610
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,302
>> JEFF: All right, you guys

611
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:07,928
ready to get to today's immunity

612
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,429
challenge?

613
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,182
First things first, Todd.

614
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,851
Take back immunity.

615
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,687
Once again, immunity back up for

616
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,022
grabs.

617
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:19,606
Today's challenge will be a

618
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,359
food-eating competition.

619
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,278
You're going to eat traditional

620
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,074
Chinese dishes that are anything

621
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,118
but pleasant.

622
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,119
>> Oh, my god.

623
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:32,953
>> Oh, gross.

624
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,829
>> One at a time, players from

625
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,913
each tribe will step up and

626
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,997
square off.

627
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,040
The first person to get their

628
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,166
food down scores a point for

629
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:38,959
their tribe.

630
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,252
The first tribe to four wins

631
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,087
immunity, safe in this game.

632
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,462
Make sense?

633
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,547
>> Oh, yeah.

634
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,631
>> JEFF: Fei Long, you have

635
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,507
three extra members.

636
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,425
You're sitting three people out.

637
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,385
You cannot sit the same people

638
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,010
out in back-to-back challenges.

639
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,721
Courtney, Amanda, and Denise sat

640
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,515
out in the last challenge.

641
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,516
You are playing in this

642
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:54,766
challenge.

643
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,351
You need one more member to join

644
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,144
them.

645
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,019
>> That's going to be Frosti.

646
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,479
>> JEFF: Frosti.

647
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,605
Everybody else take a spot on

648
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,773
the bench.

649
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,566
We'll get started.

650
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,985
First two come up.

651
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,611
Frosti taking on Peih-Gee.

652
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,990
>> Come on, Frosti.

653
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,032
You own this.

654
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,159
>> JEFF: Chinese name for

655
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,660
this,<i> ghi ching.</i>

656
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,703
You know what that is?

657
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,079
>> No.

658
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,206
>> JEFF: Chicken hearts.

659
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,291
>> Oh, yeah.

660
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,375
You own this!

661
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:20,709
>> Oh, my god.

662
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,713
>> JEFF: Ten each.

663
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,381
Got to get all ten down.

664
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,507
Survivors ready?

665
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,594
Go.

666
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,721
Peih-Gee shoving them down.

667
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,055
Frosti shoving them down.

668
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,601
>> Swallow them, Peih-Gee.

669
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,394
>> Oh, Frosti, don't enjoy them,

670
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:39,728
swallow them.

671
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,771
>> Swallow, Peih-Gee, swallow.

672
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,064
>> That's it, Frosti, good job.

673
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,774
>> JEFF: Frosti making quick

674
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,193

00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:46,776
He's got to get them down now.

676
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,653
>> Oh, that's beautiful.

677
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,614
>> JEFF: He's licking the plate.

678
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,740
>> Yeah, baby!

679
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,616
>> What?

680
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,743
>> JEFF: For emphasis.

681
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,286
Fei Long scores.

682
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:01,541
Fei Long leads, one-zip.

00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,795
Next two, Jaime and Courtney.

684
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,422

You guys got off easy-- eel.

Probably the best food you've

700
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,775
had in 18 days.

701
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,736
Jaime not messing around.

00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,082
Chinese name for this,<i> mau dje</i>

765
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,710
<i>don.</i>

766
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,421
Balut is the name we call it.

767
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,466
These are chicken fetuses.

768
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,883
>> Come on, Denise.

769
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,635
You can do this.

770
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,845
>> JEFF: You each have two.

771
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,055
They've been weighed.

772
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,890
It is equal portions.

773
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,016
They still have the feathers on

774
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,267
them, so be careful of that when

775
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,810
they go down.

776
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,313
Zhan Hu leads two-one.

777
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,564
Playing to four.

778
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,733
Survivors ready?

779
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,735
Go.

780
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,820
>> Ah!

781
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,072
>> JEFF: James spitting it back

782
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:37,989
up.

783
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,032
>> Come on, James.

784
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:39,991
It's a cheeseburger.

785
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:40,825
Oh, it's a sandwich.

786
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,242
>> Get in my mouth!

787
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:41,785
Ah!

788
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,661
Get in there.

789
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:43,912
Aaggh!

790
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,955
>> JEFF: Denise takes a big

791
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,332
chunk of feathers.

792
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,666
James struggling.

793
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,250
>> James, you're going to let

794
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,086
Denise show you up?

795
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,462
>> JEFF: James spitting it back

796
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,797
up into his bowl.

797
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,340
>> Over in two seconds.

798
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,716
>> Just swallow it, Denise.

799
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,051
You got this, own it!

800
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,345
>> JEFF: Denise, you're

801
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,805
struggling.

802
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,349
Mind over matter.

803
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,267
>> That's the way, Denise.

804
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:06,935
Denise puts it down, and it

805
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,479
comes right back up.

806
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,105
>> Oh, Denise, you've got him.

807
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,315
>> Denise, you've got him.

808
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:12,899
He's gagging on it, Denise.

809
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,692
>> Oh, yeah, he's full from

810
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:14,943
breakfast.

811
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,860
>> Are you giving up, James?

812
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,737
Give me a break.

813
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,279
You going to let Denise beat

814
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:18,947
you.?

815
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,285
>> You've got this James.

816
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,205
>> Put it in your mouth, hold

817
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:27,914
your nose, chew and swallow.

818
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,833
>> Yeah, hold your nose, James.

819
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,959
>> Sorry, James.

820
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,336
>> JEFF: Denise, you giving up?

821
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,796
>> No way Denise is giving up.

822
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,549
>> Denise, come on.

823
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,852
>> I got it.

824
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,187
>> Oh, god.

825
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,397
>> Chew it.

826
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,981
>> JEFF: James puts it all in

827
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,192
his mouth.

828
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:56,776
>> Come on, man.

829
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,903
>> JEFF: James scores for Zhan

830
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,030
Hu.

831
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:05,410
Zhan Hu leads 3-1.

832
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,453
>> You are the man!

833
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,370
Give him some water.

834
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:07,829
Good job, Denise.

835
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,998
>> JEFF: Next two, come up.

836
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,167
Frosti coming up for Fei Long.

837
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,085
Erik coming back for Zhan Hu.

838
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,753
Everybody's gone once.

839
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,630
We're on the second round.

840
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,840
<i>Pei dhong</i> is the name.

841
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,968
Thousand-year-old egg.

842
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,053
Put a little clay around them,

843
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,722
some ash to keep them preserved.

844
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,806
I promise you this will not be

845
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,807
the best thing you've ever

846
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,933
eaten, and it will rival

847
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,894
anything you've tried before.

848
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,937
>> Yes.

849
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,189
>> JEFF: Here's where we stand.

850
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,023
Zhan Hu leads three-one.

851
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,400
Frosti, if you do not win this

852
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,194
point, Zhan Hu wins immunity.

853
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,904
Eric, win this point, you win

854
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,697
immunity for Zhan Hu.

855
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,948
Survivors ready.

856
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:48,119
Go.

857
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,746
Frosti is not messing around at

858
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,706
all.

859
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:52,790
Get it all in there.

860
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,877
>> Come on, Frost.

861
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,880
Erik's got it for Zhan Hu.

862
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,924
Zhan Hu wins immunity.

863
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,517
>> Good job, Frost.

864
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,520
Zhan Hu, congratulations.

865
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,438
No tribal council tonight,

866
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,606
nobody going home.

867
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,566
>> Yes!

868
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,068
>> Finally.

869
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,152
>> JEFF: Fei Long, tribal

870
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,237
council tonight where one of the

871
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,905
seven of you will be going home.

872
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,865
Grab your stuff, head back to

873
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,074
camp.

874
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,742
I'll see you at tribal.

875
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,994
>> See you, guys.

876
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,848
>> Heads up high, guys, because

877
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,141
we played well.

878
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,935
Denise, you got brutalized.

879
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:54,978
That was, like... obviously,

880
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,145
that was the toughest one.

881
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,272
>> I just feel bad, though, you

882
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,356
know.

883
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,941
I'm sorry.

884
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,109
I let my teammates down today.

885
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,611
James tried to eat that balut as

886
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,196
slow as he possibly could so

887
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,864
that I could keep up with him.

888
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,533
But unfortunately, I just could

889
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,201
not get that down my throat, so

890
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,455
we ended up on the losing end.

891
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,917
>> Perfect plan, genius idea,

892
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,795
smashed.

893
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:21,879
And so we're trying to look on

894
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,505
the positive side and say, "Hey,

895
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,047
we lost."

896
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,966
We still get rid of one of the

897
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,051
old Zhan Hu, and we still have

898
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,220
our numbers.

899
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,149
Courtney's on our side for sure.

900
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,568
I'm positive, almost positive

901
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,402
James is on our side.

902
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,236
>> Yeah.

903
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,987
>> Because he did try to throw

904
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,195
that.

905
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,697
And I don't think he has

906
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,448
anything going on with the new

907
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,157
guys.

908
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,657
>> No, I don't think so.

909
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,783
I think he's... seriously, I

910
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,576
think he's with us.

911
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,327
>> He's with us.

912
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,036
>> I really do think he's with

913
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,202
us.

914
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:53,953
>> We've got five right there.

915
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,913
And I'm almost 100% positive

916
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,207
that Frosti will stay.

917
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,167
Right now we need him to trust

918
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,085
us and this tonight will help

919
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,086
him trust us.

920
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:02,962
Does that make sense?

921
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,047
Because we want to trust him

922
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,089
just as much as he wants to

923
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,175
trust us.

924
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,302
>> I'm also coming to get water.

925
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,386
>> Oh, good.

926
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,972
So Sherea is gone tonight.

927
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,017
>> Right.

928
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:17,810
>> All right, so we're in

929
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,519
agreement for Sherea tonight,

930
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,562
huh?

931
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,313
>> Yeah.

932
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,440
>> So after Todd's and Amanda's

933
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,483
plans went awry, they're like,

934
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,275
"Okay, well, no question about

935
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,068
it, we're voting off Sherea,

936
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:25,276
okay?"

937
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,069
Sherea, Sherea, Sherea.

938
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,029
And I'm like, "Yeah, okay,

939
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,489
whatever."

940
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,698
But when I thought about for a

941
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,659
little while, I actually like

942
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,951
Sharea.

943
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,703
And if it came down to it of who

944
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,829
I thought would vote me out

945
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,997
quicker, I definitely think that

946
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,166
she would keep me around longer

947
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,044
than Jean-Robert.

948
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,875
>> Well, right now, the people

949
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,252
at Fei Long want me to go home.

950
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,586
What they don't understand is

951
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,629
they need to be scared of the

952
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,213
people in their tribe, too.

953
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,132
You know, as far as Jean-Robert,

954
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,008
he'll vote any of them out.

955
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,885
So the same time they're looking

956
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,511
at me, they need to be scared of

957
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,639
each other.

958
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,142
Mm-hmm.

959
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,023
>> You know, everybody's name

960
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,067
gets on the list eventually.

961
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:48,609
I mean, I hate doing it, I

962
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,235
really do, because I like her a

963
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,903
lot.

964
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,696
I hate it.

965
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,197
>> I do, too.

966
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,198
>> Obviously, I'd rather it be

967
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,200
her than me, and I think it's a

968
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,287
smarter move.

969
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,421
>> Do you know what I mean?

970
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,255
>> It's the smarter idea right

971
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,214
now to stick with more of our

972
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,924
tribe.

973
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,176
And honestly, it has to be

974
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,636
Frosti or Sharea.

975
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,350
>> Do you know what I mean?

976
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,560
>> No, I totally understand.

977
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,395
>> Eventually, it will be down

978
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,230
to like, our people, you know?

979
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,565
But right now, it's not.

980
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,858
And we have to look at the

981
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,485
bigger picture of things.

982
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,195
>> The thing is, it's like, our

983
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,654
great plan didn't work today

984
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,280
either.

985
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:40,203
Do you know what I mean?

986
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,122
>> There's only so much planning

987
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,624
we can do at, like, every stage.

988
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,125
Like, you can't predict what's

989
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,294
going to happen.

990
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,015
>> I like to trust my gut and my

991
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,726
vibe, and so far, I've really

992
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,311
felt comfortable about my

993
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,981
position in the game.

994
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,149
All of a sudden, something

995
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,568
doesn't feel 100% to me.

996
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,695
The plan was either Sherea or

997
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,363
Frosti, most likely Sherea.

998
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,657
But I've got to tell you, I'm

999
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,451
uneasy right now.

1000
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,458
>> I feel like we should vote

1001
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,209
out Jean-Robert tonight.

1002
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:28,751
Do you know what's happening

1003
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,127
now?

1004
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:30,711
We are lining ourselves up as

1005
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,922
power players.

1006
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,549
They will get rid of us if we

1007
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,633
don't start doing what people

1008
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,884
want.

1009
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,220
Because Jean-Robert is not

1010
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,181
stupid, and he will turn on us.

1011
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,933
He will.

1012
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,392
>> Sharea will too.

1013
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:49,021
Todd, I don't know.

1014
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,398
I think Jean-Robert definitely

1015
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,649
has to go.

1016
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,692
I don't think now is the time,

1017
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,401
honestly.

1018
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,028
>> I don't know what to do.

1019
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,697
>> Honestly, my gut feeling is

1020
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,865
that...

1021
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:04,078
>> My gut's saying Jean-Robert.

1022
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,913
>> So I guess it comes down to

1023
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,373
who we feel we can trust more at

1024
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,624
this point-- Jean-Robert or

1025
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,835
Sherea.

1026
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,129
>> I... this sucks.

1027
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,158
>> JEFF: Well, when you're

1028
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:42,783
winning, it's easy to get along.

1029
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,243
You start to lose, things

1030
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,494
change.

1031
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,871
Sherea, what did you sense when

1032
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,997
you guys got back today after

1033
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,206
losing?

1034
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,207
>> I sense a lot of shadiness

1035
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,375
today.

1036
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,044
You know, people talking like,

1037
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,003
"Let's talk here.

1038
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:54,837
Okay, now let's talk.

1039
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,588
Let me go talk.

1040
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,255
I'll be back."

1041
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:56,797
That's how it's running over

1042
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,256
here, you know?

1043
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,926
>> JEFF: Jean-Robert, does the

1044
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,427
game continue to change day to

1045
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,429
day, and does that then affect

1046
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,432
the way you play it?

1047
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,558
>> I'll tell you what-- it's day

1048
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,935
18, Jeff, and I'm a changed

1049
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,102
person.

1050
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:10,686
I mean, I find myself doing a

1051
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,396
little cooking, a little fire.

1052
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,731
And it's routine now.

1053
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,191
It's not even chores.

1054
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:15,775
>> Did you ask him all that?

1055
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,985
Wow.

1056
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,611
Somebody along the way told him

1057
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,362
that he had something important

1058
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,488
to say, because he does a lot of

1059
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,573
talking, always running his

1060
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,118
mouth, story after story.

1061
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,703
>> What do you say to that?

1062
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,871
>> You don't say anything.

1063
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,705
That's why you don't say

1064
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,539
anything to me, because you know

1065
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,415
you don't want me to say

1066
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,416
anything back to you.

1067
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,292
You talk to the people who

1068
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:33,918
aren't going to say anything to

1069
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,169
you.

1070
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,128
Little do you know, they don't

1071
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,964
like you.

1072
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,632
>> JEFF: Would that surprise

1073
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,467
you, Jean-Robert, if you found

1074
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,301
out that the people on the tribe

1075
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,803
didn't like you?

1076
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,012
>> I'm certain that some of the

1077
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:45,805
people do not like me.

1078
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,138
I'm a bad boy.

1079
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:46,639
Sometimes that happens.

1080
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,850
But, you know, even as a bad

1081
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,851
boy, and being aggressive, I

1082
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,769
like the way I'm playing this

1083
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,687
game, and I think I'm doing just

1084
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,646
fine.

1085
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,189
>> JEFF: Courtney, the look on

1086
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,232
your face, very smug.

1087
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,275
>> Bad boy?

1088
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,694
Not quite the term I would have

1089
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,779
perhaps selected.

1090
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,531
But it's always interesting to

1091
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,199
hear people talk about

1092
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,368
themselves and, really, "Bad

1093
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,120
boy, bad boy," because you play

1094
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,705
poker or something?

1095
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,414
Do you have a Harley I don't

1096
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,415
know about?

1097
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,374
>> JEFF: Would a Harley make

1098
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,375
Jean-Robert a bad boy?

1099
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,501
>> Well, I mean, bad boy... who

1100
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,419
do you think you are, Luke

1101
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,378
Perry?

1102
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,463
>> JEFF: How would you describe

1103
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,091
Jean-Robert, Courtney?

1104
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,801
>> I mean, we don't get along.

1105
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,343
We don't like each other.

1106
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,511
I think he walks around, he

1107
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,430
talks a lot, jokes that aren't

1108
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,556
funny, lot of judgments of other

1109
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,099
people, a lot of self-

1110
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,559
righteousness.

1111
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,727
You know, I think, like, that

1112
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,687
kind of stuff is, like... he's

1113
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,396
just a crappy person.

1114
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,940
And, yeah, I'm going to laugh at

1115
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:38,899
him when he's like, "I'm a bad

1116
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,525
boy, but, you know, I go out and

1117
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,485
get some fish."

1118
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,486
Like, it's just funny, just as

1119
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,072
an observer and to being like

1120
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,532
sort of the outsider of my

1121
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,950
tribe.

1122
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,160
Like, I know we have two members

1123
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:49,702
of another tribe that have

1124
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,871
joined us, but I think I was on

1125
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,206
the outs before they got here.

1126
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,249
>> See, that kinds of hurts,

1127
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,292
though, because I love you, and

1128
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,543
I've love you since day three,

1129
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,544
is what I say, because day one

1130
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,378
and two I didn't really like

1131
00:38:59,462 --> 00:38:59,587
you.

1132
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,588
>> But...

1133
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,505
>> I love you, and we get along

1134
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,381
so well.

1135
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,258
>> I love you guys, too, but

1136
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,092
it's also... you know, it's a

1137
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,594
really cliquey tribe.

1138
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,511
>> And I click well with you is

1139
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,929
how I felt.

1140
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:09,972
And so, like, for you to say

1141
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,140
that you're on the outskirts and

1142
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,266
that you're not close to me is a

1143
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,851
little bit of, like, rubbing

1144
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:14,602
salt in the wounds.

1145
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,188
>> But...

1146
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,314
>> I guess that's just how it

1147
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:18,606
is, though.

1148
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,484
>> I got to tell you, Jeff, even

1149
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,070
with this infighting going on,

1150
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,196
and this is a place to air out

1151
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:25,821
dirty laundry, when it comes to

1152
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,325
the challenges and coming

1153
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,284
together, I think we really do

1154
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,118
work well together as a team.

1155
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:31,952
And to be honest with you, we're

1156
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:32,787
in a good spot.

1157
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,871
I like where we're at.

1158
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,830
>> JEFF: On that note, it is

1159
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,040
time to vote.

1160
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,375
Denise, you're up.

1161
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,555
>> It's unfortunate we didn't

1162
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,431
get a chance to know each other

1163
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,683
a little better.

1164
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,613
>> Somebody along the way told

1165
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,531
you you were hot.

1166
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,448
I'm going to bust that big

1167
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,449
bubble you call a mouth and tell

1168
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,993
you you're not.

1169
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,550
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1170
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,969
votes.

1171
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,643
Once the votes are read, the

1172
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,519
decision is final.

1173
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,478
The person voted out will be

1174
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,438
asked to leave the tribal

1175
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,439
council area immediately.

1176
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,774
I'll read the votes.

1177
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:52,199
First vote, J.R, Jean-Robert.

1178
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:52,491
Jean-Robert.

1179
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,702
Two votes Jean-Robert.

1180
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,206
Sherea.

1181
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,082
Two votes Jean-Robert, one vote

1182
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,418
Sherea.

1183
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,670
Sherea.

1184
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,713
Two votes Jean-Robert, two votes

1185
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,798
Sherea.

1186
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,218
Sherea.

1187
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,303
That's three votes Sherea, two

1188
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:15,139
votes Jean-Robert.

1189
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,558
Sixth person voted out of

1190
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,268
<i>Survivor: China,</i> Sherea.

1191
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,019
That's four.

1192
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:20,811
That's enough.

1193
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,314
You need to bring me your torch.

1194
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,908
Sherea, the tribe has spoken.

1195
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,996
Time for you to go.

1196
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,298
Grab your torches, head back to

1197
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,090
camp.

1198
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:50,758
Good night.

from our next episode.

>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1208
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,787
Jamie and Erik make a discovery.

1209
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,581
>> It looks idol-ish.

1210
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,749
>> I want to be friends with

1211
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,584
you!

1212
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,669
>> JEFF: Todd struggles to held

1213
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,836
his alliance together.

1214
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,712
>> I don't feel like you're my

1215
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:28,963
friends.

1216
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:29,630
>> If I get screwed, I'm going

1217
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,673
to hold you responsible.

1218
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,175
>> JEFF: Drop your buffs.

1219
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,469
>> Oh, my god!

1220
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,184
>> The fact that the Fei Long

1221
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,019
people decided to stick together

1222
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,354
because of numbers, you know, it

1223
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,939
just says that they're getting

1224
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,357
played.

1225
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,192
They'll realize it sooner or

1226
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:50,818
later, and I hope half of them

1227
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,777
get screwed, since some of them

1228
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,654
screwed me.

1229
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,238
But, you know, they knew they

1230
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,489
couldn't beat me in the

1231
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:56,198
challenges.

1232
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:56,907
I was the strong one, they were

1233
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,700
the weak ones.

1234
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,325
So of course they're going to

1235
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,202
take out the threat.
