1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,085
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:02,669
"SURVIVOR"... EIGHTH PERSON

3
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:03,294
VOTED OUT AND THE SECOND MEMBER

4
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:07,382
OF OUR JURY, JEREMY.

5
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,467
AFTER JON BLIND SIDED JEREMY AND

6
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,261
REVEALED HE FOUND THE IMMUNITY

7
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,555
IDOL, NATALIE AND BAYLOR WANTED

8
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,682
HIM OUT.

9
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,978
>> I SAY JON, BUT DON'T TELL

10
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,312
ANYONE.

11
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,399
>> Jeff: BY AFTER JON WON

12
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,068
IMMUNITY -- JON WINS INDIVIDUAL

13
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,446
IMMUNITY -- THE MAJORITY

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,990
ALLIANCE DECIDE TO TAKE OUT

15
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:32,198
KEITH.

16
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,825
>> WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

17
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,994
WE SHOULD VOTE KEITH AND HE'S

18
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:36,995
GOING HOME AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T

19
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:37,912
HAVE AN IDOL.

20
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,289
>> Jeff: BUT NATALIE HAD A

21
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,290
DIFFERENT IDEA.

22
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,292
AND AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, NATALIE

23
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,168
SECRETLY SWITCHED HER VOTE TO

24
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:48,047
RUIN JON'S PLAN.

25
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,716
>> KEITH, BUT I'M VOTING FOR

26
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,342
YOU.

27
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,262
>> Jeff: 11th PERSON VOTED

28
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,973
OUT, ALEC.

29
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,350
ALEC, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

30
00:00:59,434 --> 00:00:59,684
SIX ARE LEFT.

31
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:15,742
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

32
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,329
>> I'M COLD.

33
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:24,834
>> ME, YOU AND --

34
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,756
>> JUST THE WAY TRIBAL WENT, I

35
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,466
KNEW I HAD TO PRETEND TO MESS UP

36
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,259
AND ACCIDENTALLY VOTE OWL ALEC

37
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,387
INSTEAD OF KEITH, AND ACT MY ASS

38
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,056
OFF TO CONVINCE THEM IT WAS A

39
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:38,306
MISTAKE.

40
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,475
>> HE CAME UP TO ME.

41
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,434
I DIDN'T TALK TO HIM.

42
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,228
>> IT WAS A RISK I WAS WILLING

43
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,437
TO TAKE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT

44
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,647
JON TO HAVE MORE POWER AND

45
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,191
CONTROL IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW

46
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,486
THAN HE NEEDS.

47
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,321
I THINK I SOLD IT TO THEM

48
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,739
PROPERLY, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE

49
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,323
SCARY, BUT JON IS ON MY HIT

50
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,491
LIST.

51
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,118
HE'S BEEN ON MY HIT LIST SINCE

52
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,787
HE SENT JEREMY HOME, SO IT'S

53
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,704
BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.

54
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,374
I NEED TO MAKE SOME MOVES SOON.

55
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,375
>> NOBODY TALKED TO ME.

56
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,878
NOBODY CHECKED IN WITH ME.

57
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,630
>> IT'S HILARIOUS WATCHING

58
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,509
NATALIE BE AN ACTRESS TOWARD JON

59
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,094
AND JACLYN TONIGHT.

60
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,470
IF THEY WERE SMART, THEY WOULD

61
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,805
KNOW NATALIE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT

62
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,138
SHE WAS DOING.

63
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:19,931
>> IT'S FINE.

64
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,641
>> TRIBAL WAS A DEBACLE.

65
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,059
I GUESS WE DIDN'T TALK ENOUGH

66
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:23,601
GOING INTO IT, AND NATALIE

67
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,645
DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHO SHE

68
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,271
WAS VOTING FOR.

69
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,981
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT IT

70
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,565
HAPPENED HERE, BECAUSE KEITH

71
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,151
REALLY IS A THREAT IN IMMUNITY

72
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:32,443
CHALLENGES.

73
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,736
>> THAT'S A BIG, BIG DEAL.

74
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,822
THAT POTENTIALLY COULD SCREW UP

75
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:52,213
A LOT OF PLANS.

76
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,133
>> HOW DID THE VOTES WORK?

77
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,051
>> I WAS SUPPOSED TO VOTE FOR

78
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,595
YOU AND I VOTED FOR ALEC.

79
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,306
>> HAVE YOU ABOUT HAD IT WITH

80
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:01,514
ALEC?

81
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,266
>> YES BECAUSE ALEC WAS OBSESSED

82
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:03,766
WITH JON FOR NO REASON.

83
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,603
>> MAN, IT SEEMS LIKE I JUST

84
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,396
KEEP SQUEAKING BY, SQUEAKING BY,

85
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,314
SQUEAKING BY.

86
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,399
>> THEY ALL KNOW THAT IT WAS ME,

87
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:16,321
SO ME, YOU, MISSY AND BAYLOR, WE

88
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:16,738
HAVE TO BE TIGHT.

89
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,366
>> MAYBE NOW 30 DAYS INTO THIS I

90
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:20,700
HAVE SOMEBODY.

91
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,160
I HAVE NAT.

92
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,828
WHAT COULD HAPPEN AFTER THAT,

93
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,120
WHO KNOWS.

94
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,664
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE IN

95
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,916
THE GAME LONGER THAN ALEC.

96
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,417
>> DON'T PAY THOSE TWO ANYMORE.

97
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,462
>> YOU MEAN MISS PROM QUEEN OR

98
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,630
MISS HOMECOMING QUEEN?

99
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,716
>> IT'S UNPREDICTABLE, BUT I

100
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,342
TOLD KEITH HE WAS BASICALLY HERE

101
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,093
BECAUSE OF ME.

102
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:39,636
I TOLD HIM THAT ME AND BAY

103
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,261
ALREADY AT THE END OF THE DAY

104
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,096
HAD HIS BACK.

105
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,639
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL RESONATE

106
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,349
WITH HIM AND HE WILL BE A

107
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,267
PERFECT PERSON TO USE IN OUR

108
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,438
PLAN AGAINST JON.

109
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:31,396
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

110
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,524
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

111
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:34,941

115
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,487

ON MY GO, YOU'LL RACE THROUGH A

118
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:42,782
TUNNEL OF HAY.

119
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,701
YOU'LL THEN MAKE YOU WAY OVER

00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,503
YOU'LL THEN POUR THAT WATER INTO

126
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,337
A LARGER BUCKET.

127
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,256
WHEN THAT BUCKET FILLS, IT WILL

128
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:58,965
LOWER A GATE.

129
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,009
YOU'LL THEN RACE TO SOLVE A

130
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,302
PLANK PUZZLE.

FOR?

135
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,100

YOU'RE ALL TETHERED TOGETHER.

00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,505
IT'S VERY HARD TO MOVE.

00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,734
FILL IT WITH WATER.

190
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,319
OVER THE TEETER TOTTER THEY GO.

191
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:43,611
>> COME ON.

192
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,073
>> GO.

193
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,533
>> Jeff: BIG FALL.

194
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,617
JON, MISSY, KEITH, THEY'VE GOT

195
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,786
THEIR BUCKET.

196
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,122
THE GOAL IS TO ADD ENOUGH WATER

197
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,665
TO DROP YOUR BUCKET, OPENING THE

198
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,417
GATE.

199
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,712
MISSY COMES DOWN HARD ON THAT.

200
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,092
MISSY MOVING SLOWLY.

201
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,343
NOTHING EASY ABOUT GOING OVER

202
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,220
THIS TEETER TOTTER TIED TO TWO

203
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,555
OTHER PEOPLE CARRYING A BUCKET

204
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,305
OF WATER.

205
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:11,681
>> YOU OKAY?

206
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,434
>> COME ON, JAC.

207
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,894
>> Jeff: ANOTHER BIG FALL BY

208
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,229
JACLYN.

209
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,689
JON, KEITH AND MISSY MOVING VERY

210
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,481
SLOWLY NOW.

211
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,275
THE TRICK IS KEEPING YOUR

212
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,570
BALANCE WHILE HOLDING THE WATER.

213
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,072
JON, MISSY, KEITH COMING BACK.

214
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,075
WE'RE VERY TIGHT RIGHT NOW.

215
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,035
WILL THIS BE ENOUGH WATER?

216
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,495
YOU GOT TO RAISE THAT BAG.

217
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,832
THAT WILL DO IT.

218
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,708
HEAD ACROSS.

219
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,626
>> BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

220
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,839
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

221
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:49,218
>> Jeff: MISSY HOBBLEING.

222
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,220
JON, MISSY, KEITH SPILL A LOT OF

223
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:51,888
THEIR WATER.

224
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,140
WILL THIS BE ENOUGH?

225
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,850
NO, THEY'VE GOT TO GO BACK.

226
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:56,976
YELLOW IS ALREADY WORKING ON THE

227
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,438
PUZZLE.

228
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:06,319
BLUE NEEDS TO MOVE.

229
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,528
KEITH AND JON HELPING MISSY

230
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,989
THROUGH THIS COURSE.

231
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,532
JON, MISSY, KEITH HOPING THIS IS

232
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,411
ENOUGH WATER.

233
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,370
YES, THAT'S ENOUGH.

234
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:16,746
GET ACROSS.

235
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,664
>> SIDE BY SIDE.

236
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,209
>> Jeff: CAN BLUE PICK IT UP?

237
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,335
>> ONE, TWO.

238
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,461
ONE, TWO.

239
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,587
>> THAT'S AN R RIGHT THERE.

240
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,464
>> WHERE'S A?

241
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,173
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY WORKING ON

242
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,132
THE PUZZLE.

243
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:28,758
BIG REWARD ON THE LINE.

244
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:33,596
GET CLEAN, GET FED.

245
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,014
BLUE HAS A LOT OF TIME TO MAKE

246
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,226
UP.

247
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,936
IT WILL COME DOWN TO THE PUZZLE.

248
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,648
WHO WORKS TOGETHER THE BEST?

249
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,442
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

250
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:46,776
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

251
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,444
>> NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

252
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:48,694
LOOK.

253
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,780
>> Jeff: THE GIRLS ARGUING,

STARTING TO PICK UP THE PACE.

259

260
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,457
THIS GOES HERE.

261
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:01,832
>> HOLE ON, GUYS.

262
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,543
I GOT IT HERE.

263
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,293
GIVE ME THAT.

264
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,503

>> Jeff: JON, MISSY, KEITH

268
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:12,677
THINK THEY HAVE SOMETHING GOING

269
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,470
NOW.

270
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:15,471
GIRLS GETTING CLOSER.

271
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,807
ARE THEY RIGHT?

272
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,017
BLUE NOW GOING TO MOVE

273
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:20,643
EVERYTHING OVER.

275
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:23,729
>> I GOT THE WATER.

276
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,690
>> Jeff: BOTH TEAMS ARE MOVING

277
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,191
A LOT OF PIECES QUICKLY.

278
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:31,946
BOTH THINK THEY HAVE IT.

279
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,447
PUT YOUR PIECES OVER THERE.

280
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,031

WE'RE NECK AND NECK.

284
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,203

>> IT'S JUST SWOLLEN.

289
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,306
NO BIG DEAL.

290
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,390

MISSY, A SPA DAY BACK HOME IS A

297
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:09,692
GOOD DAY.

298
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,526
>> YES.

299
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:13,237

33 DAYS IN?

302
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,907
>> THIS IS LIKE GAME CHANGER.

303
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,200
I COULD LAST 16 MORE DAYS.

304
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,746
>> A SPA DAY FOR HER IS GOING TO

305
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,288
COMPLETELY REJUVENATE HER.

306
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,789
SHE'S GOING TO FEEL AS YOUNG AS

307
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:28,669
SHE LOOKS.

308
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,172
>> JON, YOU'RE ANNOYING RIGHT

>>

313
00:10:54,195 --> 00:11:44,078
NATALIE, YOU KNOW THE

314
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:44,954
WAY.

315
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,248
YOU WILL RETURN IN TIME FOR THE

316
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:47,748

00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,923
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.

320
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:56,757
>> THIS NOT WALK ON YOUR ANKLE.

321
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,051
>> GET ON MY BACK.

322
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,970
>> Jeff: MISSY, YOU'LL LET ME

323
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,597
KNOW IF MEDICAL NEEDS TO LOOK AT

324
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:03,806
THAT.

325
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,224
>> ENJOY THAT MASSAGE, KEITH.

326
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:05,975
>> LOOK HOW THIS WORKS OUT.

327
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,562
>> I GET TO GIVE HER, HER OWN

328
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,272
PERSONAL SPA DAY.

329
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,940
JON, JACLYN, GOT NOTHING FOR

330
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:13,649
YOU.

331
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,692
BUT YOU'VE GOT EACH OTHER.

332
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,861
>> TRADED PLACES WITH BAYLOR WAS

333
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,195
AN EASY DECISION FOR ME.

334
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:18,988
IT JUST OPENED UP A WINDOW FOR

335
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,534
ME TO DO A GOOD DEED FOR ONE OF

336
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,785
MY ALLIANCE MEMBERS TO SOLIDIFY

337
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,163
OUR ALLIANCE AND IT MAY HAVE

338
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,622
EVEN STRENGTHENED MY CASE IN THE

339
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,708
JURY.

340
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,892
>> HI.

341
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,809
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

342
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,895
>> OH, THANK YOU.

343
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,812
>> PINEAPPLE.

344
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,856
>> MMM.

345
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,651
>> I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A SPA.

346
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,486
>> THIS IS GOOD.

347
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,154
>> OH, MAN.

348
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,198
>> KEITH, GIVE ME SOME OF THAT.

349
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,410
WE WON THAT, BABY.

350
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,078
>> THANK YOU, JON.

351
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,122
THAT WAS THE NICEST THING EVER.

352
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,874
MY MOM, KEITH AND JON WON THE

353
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,209
REWARD.

354
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,377
BEFORE I KNEW IT, JON WAS LIKE,

355
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,712
I'M SWITCHING WITH BAYLOR.

356
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,588
I WAS LIKE, WHAT?

357
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,924
>> TAKE A PEEK AT MY ANKLE AND

358
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:20,424
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

359
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,220
>> THAT WAS SUPER NICE OF HIM TO

360
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,054
DO THAT, BUT GETTING JON OUT IS

361
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,598
ME AND NATALIE'S NUMBER-ONE

362
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:27,890
PRIORITY.

363
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:37,191
>> OH, I CAN TELL FROM HERE.

364
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:37,608
>> OUCH.

365
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,276
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO IT THEN.

366
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,944
>> AT THE REWARD CHALLENGE, I

367
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,029
WAS TRYING SO HARD NOT TO SHOW

368
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,532
ANY SIGNS OF PAIN IN MY ANKLE,

369
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,908
BUT I COULD JUST FEEL IT

370
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,200
SWELLING UP.

371
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,244
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

372
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:48,494
SPRAINED?

373
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,621
>> I DON'T KNOW, SPRAINED OR

374
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,288
STRAINED.

375
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,331
CAN YOU PULL AGAINST ME?

376
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,166
>> THAT HURTS REAL BAD.

377
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,293
>> THAT AIN'T GOOD.

378
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,044
>> I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN.

379
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,505
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THIS

380
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,130
NEXT COUPLE DAYS IS GOING TO GO

381
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,007
DOWN AT CHALLENGES.

382
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:02,925
I'M GOING TO DO THE BEST I CAN.

383
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,927
I'M GOING THE CRAWL IF I HAVE

384
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,345
TO, BUT I'M GOING TO FINISH.

385
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,681
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO RUIN OUR

386
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:08,931
AFTERNOON.

387
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,890
>> WHAT IS THIS?

388
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,267
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

389
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,395
>> I SEE SOME GOOBERS ON THE

390
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:14,770
END.

391
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,896
>> OH, NUTS.

392
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,064
>> OH, YEAH.

393
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,316
SLOW DOWN NOW, BAYLOR.

394
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,360
DON'T FILL UP ON THAT RABBIT

395
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:21,569
FOOD.

396
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,737
>> HE'S GOING TO DIE WHEN HE

397
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,613
SEES YOU'RE AT A SPA.

398
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,155
>> IT'S A GIRL THING, BUT AS

399
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,408
LONG AS THIS FOOD IS HERE, IT'S

400
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:27,992
A GUY THING.

401
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,993
>> YEP.

402
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,620
>> I'VE NEVER HAD A SPA DAY OR

403
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,913
SPA FOOD.

404
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:33,914
TURNED OUT NOT TOO BAD.

405
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,124
THAT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF

406
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,333
BACON.

407
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,960
>> IT'S NOT SO BAD.

408
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,797
>> NO.

409
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,591
I ATE ABOUT AS MUCH AS I COULD,

410
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,134
AND THEN I WENT OFF THE SHOWER.

411
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,012
IT KNOCKED THE FUNK OFF ME.

412
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,430
30-SOMETHING DAYS I HAVEN'T

413
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:49,638
BATHED.

414
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:54,727
THEN I WAS OFF TO THE MASSAGE.

415
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,353
SHE HIT THE RIGHT SPOT, OH, LIKE

416
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,354
RIGHT THERE.

417
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,647
OH, OH MY GOODNESS.

418
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,982
THAT'S MY BONEY RIB CAGE.

419
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,109
OH.

420
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,862
>> KEITH AT A SPA WAS PRETTY

421
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:05,154
DANG FUNNY.

422
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:05,613
>> I CAN'T BREATHE.

423
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:10,451
>> I HADN'T SEEN THAT SIDE OF

424
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:10,784
KEITH BEFORE.

425
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,662
>> I DON'T GET TO THAT MANY OF

426
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,204
THESE IN LOUISIANA.

427
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,831
>> I HAD REALIZATION.

428
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:16,498
HE'S KIND OF COOL.

429
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:22,338
>> DO YOU FEEL THE KNOTS IN YOUR

430
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:22,588
SHOULDER?

431
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,505
>> I THINK SO.

432
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,007
IT MAY BE MY BONES.

433
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,382
DON'T TELL NOBODY.

434
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,051
I DON'T WANT THE GUYS AT THE

435
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,719
FIRE STATION TO KNOW I'M GOING

436
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,012
TO A MASSEUSE.

437
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,180
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ROLL ME

438
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,973
OFF THIS BABY.

439
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:33,974
MAP, I'VE BEEN REJUVENATED.

440
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,477
I HAVE FOUR, FIVE, SIX DAYS

441
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,852
LEFT.

442
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,062
I CAN TAKE THIS ON OUT NO

443
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,313
PROBLEM NOW.

444
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:50,699
GOOD GRIEF.

445
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,284
>> I THINK ACTUALLY IT WORKED

446
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,744
OUT THE BEST IT POSSIBLY COULD

447
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,161
HAVE.

448
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,038
>> BEING AT CAMP ALONE, IT'S

449
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,248
NICE TO JUST BE THE TWO OF US.

450
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,168
>> YOU KNOW, MATT FELT REALLY

451
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:01,585
BAD ABOUT THE BOAT.

452
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,087
>> I TOLD HER, KEITH.

453
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,673
>> I KNOW YOU DID.

454
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,133
THAT WAS A GREAT THING TO BRING

455
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:08,676
UP.

456
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,885
THAT'S SOMETHING I'LL DEFINITELY

457
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,679
BRING UP IN THE JURY, 100%.

458
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,222
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPLIT VOTES,

459
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,516
KNOW WHO YOU'RE VOTING FOR.

460
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,685
>> NATALIE MADE A BIG MISTAKE,

461
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,478
VOTING FOR THE WRONG PERSON, AND

462
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,271
NOW YOU KEPT IN KEITH, ONE OF

463
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,231
THE BIGGEST THREATS.

464
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,774
CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN.

465
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,608
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING

466
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,609
FOR $1 MILLION.

467
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,486
>> BUT THEN IN THE BECOME OF MY

468
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,946
HEAD, I'M LIKE, MAYBE HER AND

469
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,114
KEITH HAD SOMETHING GOING ON.

470
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,950
SHE'S REALLY, REALLY THREATENED

471
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,992
BY US TWO PAIRS.

472
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,829
>> SO IT'S TWO VERSUS FOUR, IT

473
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,454
WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE?

474
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,081
>> WELL, MAYBE SHE WANTS A GOOD

475
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,249
PAIR.

476
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,878
MAYBE SHE TRUSTS KEITH MORE THAN

477
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,337
ALEC.

478
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,505
MAYBE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE AND

479
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,926
LIED ABOUT IT.

480
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,344
KEITH IS FREAKISHLY GOOD AT

481
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,804
THESE CHALLENGES.

482
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,681
SO IF KEITH KEEPS WINNING

483
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,682
IMMUNITY, THEN I THINK THAT

484
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,100
EVERYBODY WILL GET EVEN MORE MAD

485
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,394
AT NATALIE FOR SCREWING UP THAT

486
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:00,602
VOTE.

487
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,312
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO BREAK UP THE

488
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:17,703
FIVE SOONER THAN WE THOUGHT.

489
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,830
>> I VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO EXILE,

490
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,456
BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,

491
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,167
WHEN YOUR BODY IS ALREADY SO

492
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,585
DRAINED AND IT'S SO CLOSE TO THE

493
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,210
END YOU CAN ALMOST TASTE IT BUT

494
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,173
YOU'RE NOT THERE YET, IT'S BEEN

495
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,758
REALLY DEPRESSING ME OUT HERE.

496
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,301
IT'S BEEN REALLY A ROLLER

497
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,844
COASTER OF EMOTION FOR ME

498
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,470
BECAUSE THIS IS THE LONGEST I'VE

499
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,096
GONE WITHOUT SEEING OR TALKING

500
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,850
TO MY SISTER.

501
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,187
I'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 28 YEARS.

502
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,605
I'VE NEVER LET ANYBODY SEE HOW

503
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,439
MUCH I MISS HER.

504
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,066
AND I KIND OF ALWAYS JUST

505
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,195
PRETEND LIKE I'M FINE, BUT

506
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,654
NADIYA'S BEEN GONE FOR LIKE 30

507
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,325
DAYS NOW, AND I HAVE BEEN DOING

508
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,701
THIS WITHOUT HER, BUT I'M JUST

509
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,286
TRYING TO MAKE IT INTO SOMETHING

510
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,830
WHERE I CAN USE IT AS MOTIVATION

511
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,081
INSTEAD OF JUST BRINGING ME

512
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,291
DOWN.

513
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,044
TIME TO, YOU KNOW, BUCK UP AND

514
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,754
MAKE EVERY DECISION MOVING

515
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,213
FORWARD COUNT.

516
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,840
I HAVE ONE SHOT TO PROVE TO

517
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,300
MYSELF THAT I LEFT EVERYTHING ON

518
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,511
THE TABLE.

519
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,387
MAKE THESE LAST FOUR DAYS FULLY

520
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:32,945
WORTH IT.

521
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:50,254
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

522
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,049
CLEARLY WE HAVE SOMETHING TO

523
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,050
TALK ABOUT.

524
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,301
LET'S GET NATALIE IN HERE,

525
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:01,723
RETURNING FROM EXILE ISLAND.

526
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,308
>> HEY, GIRL.

527
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:18,657
>> YEAH.

528
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,284
>> Jeff: NATALIE, WHAT DID

529
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,118
THEY JUST HAND YOU?

530
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,705
>> SOME RICE, AND I'M HAPPY THAT

531
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,124
THEY BROUGHT IT FOR ME.

532
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,042
IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE

533
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,044
HARDEST THINGS I EVER HAD TO DO.

534
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:35,007
I CRIED PROBABLY 50% OF THE DAY.

535
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,591
IT WAS EXHAUSTING EMOTIONALLY

536
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,176
AND PHYSICALLY TO ME.

537
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,554
>> Jeff: MISSY, LAST I SAW

538
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,222
YOU, BAYLOR WAS CARRYING YOU OUT

539
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,182
ON YOUR BACK.

540
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,349
CLEARLY THE ANKLE HAS GOTTEN

541
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,058
WORSE.

542
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,102
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GETTING

543
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:50,439
WORSE.

544
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,526
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT.

545
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,404
THERE'S NO WAY.

546
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,031
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING

547
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,283
TO DO ABOUT THIS, BUT I'M GOING

548
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,285
TO TRY THE STAND ON ONE FOOT.

549
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,953
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

550
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:05,454
>> Jeff: I THINK WE SHOULD

551
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,247
HAVE MEDICAL LOOK AT IT BEFORE

552
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:07,581
THE CHALLENGE.

553
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,957
>> OKAY.

554
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,917
>> Jeff: BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

555
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,500
A LOT OF FAITH YOU'RE GOING TO

556
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,753
BE ABLE TO DO THIS GIVEN THAT

557
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,171
YOU'RE ON A CRUTCH RIGHT NOW.

558
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:14,796
SO WE'RE GOING TO BRING MEDICAL

559
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,589
IN.

560
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,716
>> ALL RIGHT.

561
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,383
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

562
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:24,806
MEDICAL.

563
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,224
WHY DON'T WE SIT YOU RIGHT HERE.

564
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,185
>> OKAY.

565
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,478
>> HI, MISSY.

566
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,271
SO IF WE START BY GETTING BOTH

567
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,731
SHOES OFF SO I CAN COMPARE YOUR

568
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,440
GOOD ANKLE WITH YOUR BAD ANKLE.

569
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:42,199
>> ALL RIGHT.

570
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,158
I CAN'T REALLY...

571
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,493
>> IT'S HUGE.

572
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,119
>> SO BOTH THE PAIN AND THE

573
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,079
SWELLING IS GETTING WORSE FOR

574
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:47,245
YOU?

575
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,205
>> UH-HUH.

576
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,207
>> I JUST WANT TO EXAMINE YOU.

577
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,084
I WANT TO KNOW WHICH AREA IS

578
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:52,417
SORE.

579
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,211
IF I'M CAUSING YOU PAIN, MAKE

580
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,212
SURE YOU TELL ME.

581
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:55,879
SO FAR SO GOOD?

582
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,380
>> IT'S JUST TENDER.

583
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,173
IT'S SORE.

584
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,257
OH, RIGHT THERE.

585
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:04,179
RIGHT THERE!

586
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:04,596
RIGHT THERE.

587
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,517
>> OKAY.

588
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,476
>> I HATE THAT.

589
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,104
>> OKAY, AND TRY LIKE YOUR FOOT

590
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,189
IS ON THE ACCELERATOR OF A CAR.

591
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,357
>> YEAH, THERE'S NO WAY.

592
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,442
>> NOTHING THERE.

593
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,403
>> SO GIVE THEN EXAMINATION, MY

594
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,405
CONCERN IS THAT AT THE VERY

595
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,573
LEAST WE HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT

596
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:23,824
SPRAIN.

597
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,534
>> I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO BE

598
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,453
BROKEN.

599
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,788
>> Jeff: ARE YOU CONCERNED IT

600
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,497
COULD BE BROKEN?

601
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,456
>> AFTER TWO DAYS, WHEN THINGS

602
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,458
ARE GETTING WORSE, I HAVE TO

603
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,376
CONSIDER A FRACTURE, YES.

604
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,128
>> Jeff: OKAY.

605
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,462
THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE

606
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,422
THAT THIS IS BROKEN IS TO DO AN

607
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,091
X-RAY, AND TO DO AN X-RAY, I'D

608
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,301
HAVE TO PULL MISSY FROM THE

609
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,512
GAME.

610
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:53,437
[SOBBING]

611
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,868
>> IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

612
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:08,493
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

613
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,369
SO, BEN, IS THIS SEVERE ENOUGH

614
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,830
THAT YOU AS A DOCTOR WOULD SAY

615
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,833
SHE NEEDS TO BE PULLED FROM THE

616
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,334
GAME?

617
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,671
>> OF COURSE, THERE'S ONLY A FEW

618
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,422
DAYS LEFT IN THE GAME.

619
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,174
WE CAN IMMOBILIZE THE LIMB,

620
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:26,720
WHICH MEAN NO FURTHER DAMAGE

621
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,555
WILL OCCURS, SO, NO, I DON'T

622
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,725
THINK SHE NEEDS TO BE PULLED

623
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:32,726
FROM THE GAME.

624
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,186
JEFF JEFF CLEARLY SHE'S IN PAIN.

625
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,228
IT'S NOT LIFE-THREATENING.

626
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,897
SO AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,

627
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,025
IT'S HER CALL WHAT SHE DOES IN

628
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,359
>> YES.

629
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,444
>> Jeff:, HOW ARE YOU FEELING

630
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,488
KNOWING BEEN SAID YOU MAY HAVE A

631
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:44,696
BREAK?

632
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,532
>> I'M STAYING IN THIS GAME.

633
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,450
I'M NOT QUITTING.

634
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,619
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU WANT TO

635
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,036
DO FOR THIS MOMENT?

636
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,454
>> I WANT YOU TO IMMOBILIZE IT,

637
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,790
THE SMARTEST THING TO DO.

638
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,876
AND I'M JUST GOING TO ROOT ON MY

639
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,085
TRIBE.

640
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,961
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO SIT

641
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:00,420
THIS CHALLENGE OUT.

642
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,214
THEN YOU TAKE EACH DAY AS IT

643
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:02,422
COMES.

644
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,174
>> YES.

645
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:08,595
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

646
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,555
SO YOU CAN STAY HERE WITH BEN,

647
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,974
AND WE'LL GET BACK TO OUR

648
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:19,022
CHALLENGE.

649
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,315
BAYLOR, WHAT'S THAT LIKE FOR

650
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:20,565
YOU?

651
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,067
MOM IS CLEARLY IN A TON OF PAIN.

652
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,070
>> WELL, I MEAN, MY MOM'S A

653
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:25,320
FIGHTER.

654
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,072
THAT SOUNDS REALLY SIMPLE, BUT

655
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:27,489
IT'S NOT.

656
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,993
IN OUR LIFE SHE NEVER GIVES UP,

657
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,453
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP

658
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,663
FIGHTING AND I'LL CARRY HER TO

659
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,458
THE FINISH LINE IF I HAVE TO.

660
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:38,875
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

661
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,545
SO MISSY WILL SIT THIS ONE OUT.

662
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,421
SO SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S

663
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:48,051
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

664
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,010
JON, FIRST THINGS FIRST, TAKE

665
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,597
BACK THE NECKLACE.

666
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,307
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

667
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,725
FOR GRABS.

668
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,726
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

669
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,353
GOING TO HOLD ON TO TWO HANDLES

670
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,313
WITH YOUR HANDS WHILE YOUR FEET

671
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,732
WILL BE BALANCING ON A TEETER

672
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,483
TOTTER.

673
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,526
ATTACH TO THE TEETER TOTTER IS A

674
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,694
VASE.

675
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,279
THE LONGER THIS CHALLENGE GOES,

676
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,824
THE MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE TO

677
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,199
BALANCE THAT VASE.

678
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:16,872
WHEN THE VASE DROPS, YOU'RE OUT.

679
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,707
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

680
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,710
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN

681
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:26,965
FIVE SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.

682
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,674
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE

683
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,426
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH

684
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,552
PERSON IN THE JURY, AND AS LUCK

685
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,181
WOULD HAVE IT, THE WIND GUSTS

686
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:34,848
ARE BIG.

687
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,099
THIS CHALLENGE COULD GO A LONG

688
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,435
TIME, OR IT COULD BE OVER VERY

689
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,311
QUICKLY, WHICH MEANS EVERY

690
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:39,895
SECOND THAT YOU STAY UP THERE

691
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,398
WILL COUNT.

692
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,774
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND WE'LL

693
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:57,120
GET STARTED.

694
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,081
ALL RIGHT.

695
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:04,377
EVERYBODY IS IN PLACE AND THIS

696
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,295
CHALLENGE IS ON.

697
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,463
EVERYBODY VERY STEADY OUT OF THE

698
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,255
GATE.

699
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,259
IT WON'T BE THAT WAY FOR LONG.

700
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,304
AND JUST LIKE THAT, BAYLOR WITH

701
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,141
MOVEMENT.

702
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:18,725
KEITH WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A

703
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,187
WOBBLE AND A NICE RECOVERY.

704
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,688
MISSY, YOU CAN SEE YOU HAD NO

705
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:23,939
CHANCE.

706
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,691
>> NO WAY, NO CHANCE.

707
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,152
>> Jeff: 35 DAYS.

708
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,320
WIN THIS CHALLENGE YOU ARE IN

709
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,780
THE FINAL FIVE.

710
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,115
THAT MUCH CLOSER TO THE MILLION

711
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:39,579
BUCKS.

712
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,165
YOU CANNOT LOSE YOUR

713
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:42,916
CONCENTRATION.

714
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,459
THERE'S VERY LITTLE FORGIVENESS

715
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,211
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

716
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:50,799
AS YOU WOULD EXPECT ON DAY 35 IN

717
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,676
"SURVIVOR."

718
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,762
JACLYN WOBBLING.

719
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,764
JACLYN CAN'T RECOVER.

720
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,100
JACLYN THE FIRST PERSON OUT OF

721
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,434
THIS CHALLENGE.

722
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,605
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.

723
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,607
>> Jeff: SHE'LL JOIN MISSY ON

724
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,400
THE BENCH.

725
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,820
THAT'S HOW QUICKLY IT GOES.

726
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,154
TAKE TINY ADJUSTMENTS ALL THE

727
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,531
TIME.

728
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,700
ESPECIALLY AS YOUR FEET BECOME

729
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,159
NUMB AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

730
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:23,748
THEY'RE DOING ANYMORE.

731
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,500
KEITH WOBBLING AGAIN.

732
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,793
BAY ALREADY'S VASE IS ALSO

733
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,839
MOVING.

734
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,507
BAYLOR CANNOT RECOVER.

735
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,927
BAYLOR IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

736
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:36,678
WE'RE NOW DOWN TO THREE, AND

737
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:52,694
HERE COMES A HUGE GUST OF WIND.

738
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:58,325
IT IS KEITH, NATALIE AND JON.

739
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,785
NICE JOB BY ALL THREE BATTLING

740
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,620
THAT WIND.

741
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,038
YOUR FEET ARE NUMB.

742
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,956
THE WIND IS BLOWING.

743
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,667
WHO CAN HANG THIS THERE THE

744
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:07,876
LONGEST?

745
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:24,684
WHO WANTS THIS THE MOST?

746
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,364
HERE COMES THE WIND AGAIN.

747
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,532
BRACE YOURSELF.

748
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:49,793
BIG WIND.

749
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,379
THE WIND IS TOO MUCH FOR KEITH.

750
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,296
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.

751
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,299
IT IS NATALIE AND JON FIGHTING

752
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,927
FOR IMMUNITY ON DAY 35, AND IT

753
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,303
GUARANTEES A SPOT IN THE FINAL

754
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:00,720
FIVE.

755
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,390
YOU DO NOT WANT TO RISK BEING

756
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,934
VOTED OUT TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

757
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:06,184
COUNCIL.

758
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:06,476
THIS IS IT.

759
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:17,320
YOU GOT TO WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

760
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:24,536
WIND UP AGAIN.

761
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,496
MAKING AN ALREADY DIFFICULT

762
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,956
CHALLENGE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO

763
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,457
NAVIGATE.

764
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,668
OUT OF NOWHERE, MOTHER NATURE IS

765
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:46,516
SAYING HELLO.

766
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:55,859
AND JUST LIKE THAT JON DROPS.

767
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,776
NATALIE WINS INDIVIDUAL

768
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,486
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A SPOT IN

769
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,991
THE FINAL FIVE.

770
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,868
>> THAT WAS QUICK.

771
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,536
>> I DIDN'T EVEN MOVE IT.

772
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,498
>> GOOD JOB.

773
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:15,962
>> GOOD JOB, NAT.

774
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,422
>> Jeff: NATALIE, COME ON

775
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,549
OVER.

776
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,718
>> IT MAKES EXILE SO WORTH IT.

777
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,428
>> Jeff: AFTER 35 DAYS, YOU GO

778
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,429
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

779
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,431
YOU CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS

780
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:26,639
GAME.

781
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,308
AS FOR THE OTHER FIVE OF YOU,

782
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,642
SOMEBODY IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.

783
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,935
YOU WILL BECOME THE SIXTH MEMBER

784
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,770
OF OUR JURY.

785
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,731
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK THE

786
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,398
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

787
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,024
>> NICE JOB, NAT.

788
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,817
>> KEITH IS AN INCREDIBLE

789
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,821
THREAT.

790
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,114
SO NATALIE WINNING TODAY DOES

791
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:43,865
KIND OF MAKE UP FOR HER MESSING

792
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,284
UP THE LAST VOTE.

793
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,535
SO THE PLAN IS TO DO WHAT WE

794
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,370
TRIED TO DO LAST TRIBAL AND GET

795
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,832
KEITH OUT.

796
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,224
>> THANK YOU, KEITH.

797
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:09,641
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

798
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,100
>> THE FACT MISSY HAD TO SIT OUT

799
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,728
TODAY I'M SURE WAS EXCRUCIATING

800
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,146
FOR HER AND PROBABLY JUST AS BAD

801
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,732
AS THE PAIN SHE WAS FEELING.

802
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,816
HOW YOU FEELING, MISS?

803
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,901
>> I DON'T KNOW YET.

804
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,860
>> HOW THE CHALLENGE ENDED UP

805
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,737
WAS VERY FRUSTRATING.

806
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,112
>> THAT WAS CRAZY.

807
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,072
>> DANG WIND.

808
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,325
>> BUT I'VE GOT A PLAN.

809
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,576
I HAVE TO ACCEPT IT HOWEVER

810
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,202
THINGS FALL.

811
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,078
IT'S GOING TO BE BEST.

812
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,497
>> WE SHOULD KEEP AN EYE ON

813
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,458
KEITH.

814
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,918
>> HE KNOWS WHAT'S UP.

815
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,587
>> WHO DOES HE THINK THAT WE'RE

816
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,004
VOTING FOR?

817
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:40,296
>> HE KNOWS.

818
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,006
>> JON AND JACLYN THINK WE'RE

819
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,467
ALL VOTING OUT KEITH AND KEITH

820
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,969
IS GOING HOME, BUT MY PLAN IS TO

821
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,720
BASICALLY GET OUT JON.

822
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,305
>> SO WE'RE VOTING KEITH

823
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:49,681
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

824
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,517
>> BUT JON HAS AN IDOL, SO I

825
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,310
KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

826
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,979
MY ULTIMATE PLAN IS TO SPLIT THE

827
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,023
VOTE AND BLINDSIDE JON TONIGHT.

828
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,359
TONIGHT JUST VOTE JON.

829
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:01,693
I'LL TELL YOU.

830
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,486
THE PLAN IS TO SPLIT VOTES.

831
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:09,158
IF JON PLAYS HIS IDOL, WE VOTE

832
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:09,951
OUT JACLYN.

833
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,119
GETTING OUT JON WOULD BE A DREAM

834
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:11,578
COME TRUE.

835
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,704
>> IT'S TRIBAL TONIGHT.

836
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,039
IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED,

837
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,249
MR. ALL-AMERICAN OR MISS U.S.A.

838
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:16,958
IS GOING HOME.

839
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,543
AND I'LL BE SITTING HERE WITH

840
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:18,835
FIVE.

841
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,294
>> THAT'S THE PLAN.

842
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,713
WE'RE PRETENDING LIKE WE'RE ALL

843
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,006
VOTING FOR YOU, SO AT TRIBAL

844
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,133
DON'T ACT CRAZY, BUT JUST ACT

845
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,718
DEPRESSED THAT YOU'RE GOING

846
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:26,926
HOME.

847
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,011
>> I THINK I CAN TRUST THIS

848
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,262
BUNCH.

849
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:34,434
IF I CAN'T, I'M A GONER.

850
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,227
>> I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT

851
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,437
YOU NOT WINNING.

852
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,439
I'M LIKE, WHAT IF THEY ALL

853
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:39,772
BLINDSIDE JON.

854
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,983
>> I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

855
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,485
I THINK IF THEY WERE GOING FOR

856
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,820
KEITH LAST TIME, THEY'RE GOING

857
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,779
TO GO FOR KEITH AGAIN.

858
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,489
>> KEITH WAS SUPPOSED TO GO HOME

859
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,158
LAST TIME, SO IT'S LIKE, OKAY,

860
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,701
LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH, BUT

861
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,829
I FEEL LIKE YOUR MIND CAUSES ALL

862
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,039
THIS PARANOIA.

863
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,374
COULD I GO HOME TONIGHT?

864
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,751
COULD JON GO HOME TONIGHT?

865
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,587
YOU NEVER KNOW 100%, BUT AT

866
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,171
LEAST JON STILL HAS HIS IDOL.

867
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,008
>> I KNOW I'M BEING PARANOID,

868
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,302
BUT I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

869
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:09,636
BLINDSIDE JON.

870
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,720
>> I DON'T THINK THAT.

871
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,054
>> OKAY.

872
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,306
>> JON IS SUPER BIG ON

873
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,474
VISUALIZING THE WIND, AND IT'S

874
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,059
ALWAYS WORKED OUT FOR HIM, SO

875
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,143
HOPEFULLY IT DOES THIS TIME,

876
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,855
TOO.

877
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,607
>> WE VOTE, TWO, TWO, TWO.

878
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:22,982
>> YES.

879
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,026
>> YOU AND KEITH VOTE JON, MY

880
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,779
MOM AND ME VOTE JACLYN, AND THEM

881
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,157
TWO, JOHN AND JACLYN VET KEITH.

882
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,242
IF HE PLAYS THE IDOL, WE VOTE

883
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,453
JACLYN OUT.

884
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,162
I NEED MY MOM TO GET ON BOARD,

885
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,082
BUT MY MOM TREATS JON LIKE HER

886
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,042
SON THAT SHE NEVER HAD, SO I'M

887
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,085
WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

888
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,380
SHE'LL WRITE HIS NAME DOWN.

889
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,798
IT JUST REALLY DEPENDS ON MY

890
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:46,964
MOM.

891
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,092
>> NATALIE AND I THINK WE SHOULD

892
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,009
VOTE JON.

893
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,969
>> BAYLOR, I CAN'T DO THAT.

894
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:52,470
>> WHY?

895
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,722
>> I'VE GIVEN HIM MY WORD TO THE

896
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,807
END AND I WILL GET NO VOTES.

897
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,183
>> BUT CHALLENGE-WISE, YOU'RE

898
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,643
NEVER GOING TO WIN.

899
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,852
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

900
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,022
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

901
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,024
>> MY, BUT GOING WITH NATALIE

902
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,694
AND KEITH AND ME, THAT'S A LOT

903
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,277
BETTER CHANCE.

904
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,071
>> BAYLOR, I HAVE A DEAL WITH

905
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,699
JON, I'M NOT BREAKING THAT DEAL.

906
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,117
>> IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO GET

907
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,828
MY MOM TO WAKE UP, GET WITH THE

908
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,787
PROGRAM, LET'S MAKE A MOVE.

909
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,163
>> I'M NOT GOING TO BREAK THAT

910
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:19,539
LOYALTY.

911
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,623
>> OKAY.

912
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,541
WELL, I DON'T HAVE A DEAL WITH

913
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:21,791
JON.

914
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:22,917
>> YES, YOU DO.

915
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,960
>> NEW YORK I DON'T.

916
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,795
I HAVE NOTHING WITH JON.

917
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,213
MOM, HE'S A HUGE THREAT, AND HE

918
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,588
DOES HAVE AN IDOL.

919
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,965
>> I KNOW THAT.

920
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,925
>> SO WHY DON'T WE GET HIM OUT

921
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:31,926
WITH HIS IDOL, GOOD-BYE.

922
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,094
>> BECAUSE I CAN'T BREAK THAT.

923
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,513
>> IN MY MOM'S LIFE, THREE

924
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,597
MARRIAGE, THREE DIVORCES, SHE IS

925
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,015
PUTTING THE MEN FIRST BEFORE

926
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:38,808
HERSELF.

927
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,143
THAT'S HER DOWN SIDE I THINK,

928
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,769
AND THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE IS

929
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,895
HAPPENING IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW

930
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,146
WITH JON.

931
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:47,191
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN TRUST JON

932
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,025
IN ANY VOTE.

933
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,152
I KNOW YOU TRUST HIM, BUT I

934
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:49,736
DON'T.

935
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,070
I SAY WE VOTE OUT JON TONIGHT.

936
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,488
>> TONIGHT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

937
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,534
>> IT'S TOTALLY LIKE, MOM, HEY,

938
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,660
I'M YOUR FIRST BORN.

939
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,162
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS GUY.

940
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,288
LET'S PLAY THE GAME TOGETHER.

941
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,789
I JUST HOPE SHE'S GOING TO SEE

942
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,543
IT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

943
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,462
>> WHEN MY CHILD SAYS TO ME,

944
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,212
MOM, OUR GOAL WAS TO GO TO THE

945
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,339
END TOGETHER, I'VE HAD THE START

946
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,259
TO LISTEN, AND, YOU KNOW, HAS IT

947
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,678
CROSSED MY MIND THAT THIS

948
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,304
JON-JACLYN SHOW MAY NEED TO COME

949
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,849
TO AN END, ABSOLUTELY, BUT IT'S

950
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,350
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO FEEL LIKE I

951
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,144
PLAYED THIS GAME TRUTHFULLY.

952
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,270
I WASN'T SOME SLY DOG THAT CAME

953
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,314
IN, SHOOK PEOPLE'S HANDS AND

954
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,232
LIED IN THEIR FACES.

955
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,817
I HAVEN'T.

956
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,860
I PRIDE MYSELF ON THAT.

957
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,278
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT THIS IS THE

958
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,696
FIRST TIME I'M HAVING A TOUGH

959
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:45,458
TIME WITH IT.

960
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,638
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

961
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,599
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

962
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:07,730
JOSH, JEREMY, WES, REED, AN AN

963
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,899
ALEC VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

964
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,361
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

965
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:13,861
SO, KEITH...

966
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,153
>> YES, SIR.

967
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,447
I'VE BEEN TRYING...

968
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:16,989
>> Jeff: WAIT.

969
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,032
I DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING.

970
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:18,908
>> COME ON.

971
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,617
GIVE IT TO ME.

972
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,035
>> Jeff: NO, GIVE IT TO ME.

973
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:22,662
>> WELL, I'VE BEEN TRYING THE

974
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,246
PIERCE THIS FIVE, AND THEY'RE

975
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,998
SOLID, BUT I'M NOT INVISIBLE.

976
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,041
I'VE GOT A VOTE.

977
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,834
USE IT.

978
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,460
I THINK IT WOULD BE A BIG MOVE,

979
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,503
AND I THINK THEY WOULD THINK IT

980
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,838
WOULD BE A BIG MOVE.

981
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,923
AND BIG MOVES MEANS YOUR PLAYING

982
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:34,674
THE GAME AND PLAYING THE GAME

983
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,341
GETS YOU VOTES.

984
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,760
>> Jeff: SO WHAT DO YOU DO

985
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,679
WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE ON TO

986
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,680
OUTSIDE?

987
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,056
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

988
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:42,390
WITH YOU.

989
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,560
>> TRUST ME, I'M TRUSTWORTHY.

990
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,769
>> Jeff: YOU'RE A FIREMAN.

991
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:50,064
WHO IS MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN A

992
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:50,273
FIREMAN.

993
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,024
>> IT'S NOT A MATTER OF NOT

994
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,776
FEELING LIKE WE CAN TRUST KEITH.

995
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,736
IT'S THAT WE'VE BUILT THIS TRUST

996
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,988
WITH OUR GROUP OF FIVE.

997
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,364
I DON'T WANT TO LET THIS GROUP

998
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,033
OF FIVE DOWN.

999
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,244
I WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL IF I

1000
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,996
PEKO TO TRUST THEM IF THEY CAN'T

1001
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:05,496
TRUST ME.

1002
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,248
>> Jeff: JACLYN, IS THERE ANY

1003
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,416
ARGUMENT THAT KEITH CAN MAKE

1004
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,084
THAT COULD MAKE SENSE?

1005
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,794
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S NATURAL

1006
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,336
FOR PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT

1007
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,672
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, BUT ALL I

1008
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,340
CAN SAY, THOUGH, IS THAT I FEEL

1009
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,426
STRONG IN THE FIVE.

1010
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,177
SO I DON'T THINK JON ANDRY GOING

1011
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,264
ANYWHERE.

1012
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,224
>> Jeff: NATALIE.

1013
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,642
YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS

1014
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,144
FIVE IN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A

1015
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,812
LOVED ONE IN THE GAME.

1016
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,105
WHICH AT A CERTAIN POINT WOULD

1017
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,190
MAKE YOU VERY VALUABLE.

1018
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,276
>> YEAH, BLOOD IS REALLY, REALLY

1019
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,652
THICK.

1020
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,946
IT'S HARDER TO PENETRATE IT AND

1021
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,989
SAY, COME ON, LET'S DO

1022
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:40,281
SOMETHING.

1023
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,283
I HAVE BEEN GONE FOR TWO DAYS AT

1024
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:42,867
EXILE.

1025
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,577
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN TWO DAYS,

1026
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,580
AND SO THANK GOD I WON IMMUNITY.

1027
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,040
>> Jeff: JON, HOW MUCH TIME DO

1028
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,459
YOU SPEND THINKING ABOUT THAT

1029
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,002
FINAL SPEECH WHERE YOU MAKE THE

1030
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,378
ARGUMENT THAT STICKING TOGETHER

1031
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,214
FIVE STRONG IS A BIG MOVE?

1032
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,842
>> UM, I THINK ABOUT THAT FINAL

1033
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,844
SPEECH QUITE A BIT.

1034
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,470
YOU KNOW, STICKING TOGETHER AS

1035
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,389
FIVE IS NOT AS EASY AS ONE WOULD

1036
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,725
THINK.

1037
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,768
HAVING THE LOYALTY AND HAVING

1038
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,977
THE TRUST AND BUILDING THAT

1039
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,270
TRUST THROUGHOUT THE GAME IS

1040
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,230
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST RARE

1041
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,230
THINGS YOU CAN FIND IN

1042
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:13,522
"SURVIVOR."

1043
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,608
>> Jeff: SO MISSY, AS JON

1044
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,901
SAID, IF YOU WANT TRUST, YOU

1045
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,070
HAVE TO GIVE TRUST, BUT THE

1046
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,446
UMBRELLA OVER ALL THAT TRUST IS

1047
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,364
OUTWITH IT, OUTPLAY, OUT LAST.

1048
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,824
IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE A BIG

1049
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,700
MOVE, THIS WOULD BE A GREAT

1050
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,493
NIGHT TO DO IT.

1051
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,995
>> YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE HARD FOR

1052
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,871
ME RIGHT THIS SECOND BECAUSE

1053
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,499
WITH A BROKEN FOOT, YOU KNOW, I

1054
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,834
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN

1055
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,002
ON THIS DAY.

1056
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,712
YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS USE

1057
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,421
ME I'M A VOTE, COULD THAT BE

1058
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,340
SOMEBODY THAT COULD COME ALONG

1059
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,383
AND POTENTIALLY BREAK UP THE

1060
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,550
ALLIANZ?

1061
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,259
SURE.

1062
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,261
THAT SCENARIO COULD BE A BIG

1063
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,388
MOVE, BUT I'M PRETTY LOYAL TO A

1064
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,347
FAULT IN LIFE.

1065
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,766
THAT'S MY LIFE, SO I'VE BEEN

1066
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,892
LOYAL TO THE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN

1067
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,019
LOYAL TO FROM THE VERY

1068
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,315
BEGINNING, AND I DON'T WAIVER.

1069
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:56,732
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1070
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,111
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1071
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:07,910
JACLYN, YOU'RE UP.

1072
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,403
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1073
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,530
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMPUNITY

1074
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,532
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1075
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:51,912
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1076
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:58,753
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1077
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,253
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1078
00:38:59,336 --> 00:38:59,795
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1079
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,047
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1080
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,256
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1081
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:05,301
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1082
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,386
FIRST VOTE KEITH.

1083
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,432
JACLYN.

1084
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:15,853
KEITH.

1085
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:16,604
JACLYN.

1086
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,981
THAT'S TWO VOTES KEITH, TWO

1087
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,985
VOTES JACLYN.

1088
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:23,152
JON.

1089
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,362
THAT'S TWO VOTES KEITH, TWO

1090
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,698
VOTES JACLYN, ONE VOTE JON.

1091
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:32,828
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1092
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:32,995
JON.

1093
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,793
WE HAVE A THREE-WAY TIE.

1094
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,337
KEITH, JON AND JACLYN EACH HAVE

1095
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,879
TWO VOTES.

1096
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:42,588
WE'RE GOING TO REVOTE.

1097
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,758
JACLYN, JON, KEITH, YOU WILL NOT

1098
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,467
VOTE.

1099
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,219
BAYLOR, MISSY, NATALIE, YOU CAN

1100
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,596
ONLY VOTE FOR ONE OF THOSE

1101
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,764
THREE.

1102
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:52,556
BAYLOR, YOU'RE UP.

1103
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:11,450
WILL YOU COME GRAB THE URN.

1104
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,340
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1105
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:27,049
DECISION IS FINAL.

1106
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,592
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1107
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,636
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCILLARY

1108
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,470
IMMEDIATELY.

1109
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,473
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1110
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:40,688
FIRST VOTE JON.

1111
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,231
THE NEXT PERSON VOTED OUT AND

1112
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,150
THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

1113
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:44,316
JON.

1114
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,151
THAT'S TWO.

1115
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:45,693
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1116
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:55,536
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:18,285
DON'T.

1150
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:18,869
>> I KNOW JON.

1151
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,121

MISSY AND NATALIE DID A GOOD JOB

00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:37,596
GAINING MY TRUST.

1159
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,681
HONESTLY, DIDN'T FEEL THIS ONE

1161
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,684
