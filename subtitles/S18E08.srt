3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,423
Coach and Brendan struggled for

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,925
control of Timbira.

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:09,509
>> As much as I like leading,

6
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,260
everybody trusts you as being

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,261
the leader.

8
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,555
If Brendan got voted off, and I

9
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,097
was the leader, I think this

10
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,056
tribe would be better.

11
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,057

12
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:23,231
sides.

14
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,859
Jalapao took a beating.

15
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,317
J.T. has lost a tooth.

16
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,529

third immunity challenge in a

19
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,993
row.

20
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,077
Timbira wins immunity!

21
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,580
Brendan was saved from Tyson

22
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,081
and Coach.

23
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,459
At Jalapao, with Tribal Council

24
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,126
looming, and Taj and Stephen in

25
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,086
control of the hidden immunity

26
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,047
idol, Taj reached out to J.T.

27
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:48,673
>> Listen, I can't believe it's

28
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,174
the real immunity idol.

29
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,175
>> I know.

30
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,594
Honestly, I don't want you and

31
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,263
Stephen to go out prematurely.

32
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,973
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

33
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,808
the three stuck together.

34
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,269
Sydney, the tribe has spoken.

35
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,313
Down four members to Timbira's

36
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,315
six, Jalapao became a desperate

37
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,025
tribe.

38
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,693
Ten are left.

39
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,821
Who will be voted out tonight?

40
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,415
>> At Tribal Council, Sydney

41
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,666
was voted out.

42
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,667
It's bittersweet.

43
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,628
I felt bad that she had to go,

44
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,546
but one of us had to go, and I'm

45
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,549
glad it's not me.

46
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,135
>> After tonight's vote, I feel

47
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,386
like the odd man out.

48
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,013
Luckily, I wasn't, you know, the

49
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,306
one being voted out.

50
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,224
So, you get a little nervous.

51
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,309
You get a little concerned when

52
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,770
you see torch after torch

53
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,104
getting put out.

54
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,272
You know, it's not fun.

55
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,315
It's not fun to lose.

56
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,858
It's not fun to vote people

57
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,986
you like home.

58
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:16,386

along, but the little annoying

75
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,359
things I've had to keep bottled

76
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:54,525
in.

77
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,903
I'm the kind of person that if I

78
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,738
see it, I want to say, I want to

79
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,031
nail it, get rid of it.

80
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,824
And I was, like, you know what?

81
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,867
I need to get centered.

82
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,785
I need to pray.

83
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,869
I need to meditate.

84
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,495
And I spent about ten minutes

85
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,413
out in the water just getting

86
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,456
refocused, and it was, like,

87
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,457
boom, and everything just

88
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,458
clicked.

89
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,334
You know?

90
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,462
This is about me now.

91
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,381

92
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,008

95
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,679
So I've been pacifying

96
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,263
everybody and getting along with

97
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,348
the tribe.

98
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,476

That's awesome.

100
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,523
Coach has a new thing:

101
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,024
his morning meditation.

102
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,317
Just hanging out in the water.

103
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,735
A little bit of this going on

104
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,153
every morning.

105
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,780
If that's the thing that turned

106
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,156
you into Mr. Nice Guy around

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,908
camp, you do it every day.

108
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,534
I will take you down there, hold

109
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,577
your hand, push you in the

110
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,620
water, whatever needs to happen,

111
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,748
because I like New Coach.

112
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,006
>> What will today bring?

113
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,298
>> What do you mean by that?

114
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,299
>> Huh?

115
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:00,675
>> Competition?

116
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,385
>> No. You're like a totally

117
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,973
different person now.

118
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,101
>> Life is good.

119
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,770
>> My relationship with Coach

120
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,313
to me has been good the whole

121
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,273
time.

122
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,065
There's definitely been some

123
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,108
things he's done around camp

124
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:17,734
which are kind of annoying or

125
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,277
outside the box.

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,653
And I mean, he's always...

127
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,907
doing his hair, and we were

128
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,491
talking about it,

129
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,034
and it's like, "I kind of

130
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,493
started the samurai thing."

131
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,828
And I was, like, "Started the

132
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,996
samurai thing?"

133
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,289
Like, they've been doing it for,

134
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,331
like, thousand of years in

135
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:32,915
Japan, and Johnny Depp's been

136
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,417
doing it for, like, 20 years

137
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,460
here.

138
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,588
You didn't start anything.

139
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,599
>> It's like a knot.

140
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,767
>> I know.

141
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,642
Feel it.

142
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,643
>> Oh.

143
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,145
>> Feel how hot it is.

144
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,021
>> Yeah.

145
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:55,980
Oh, shoot.

146
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,148
Yeah.

147
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,608
>> It was all the way out here

148
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,776
yesterday, and now it's just

149
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,651
right there, so...

150
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,944
>> What got into it that made

151
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,696
it... got it infected?

152
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,530
>> A little bug?

153
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,490
>> A bug?

154
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,657
>> Like, a little, you know,

155
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,658
bacteria or parasite.

156
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,869
>> Phew!

157
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,621
The only thing that concerns me

158
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,247
about Joe right now is his leg.

159
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,916
His leg is very swollen and red

160
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,209
from the knee down.

161
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,585
It doesn't look good to me.

162
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,753
He swears that it's getting

163
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,629
better, but I don't know.

164
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,881
With these two eyes, they don't

165
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,009
look too good to me.

166
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,097
>> I'm gonna post up in the

167
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,473
hammock for a bit, man.

168
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,934
>> Joe has a... kind of a

169
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,770
bummed-up leg, and he's down and

170
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,730
out, and, you know, um, if there

171
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,065
is a merge, even if there isn't

172
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,066
a merge, we're still...

173
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,984
Jalapao is still down to four

174
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,027
members, and things are really

175
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,028
not looking our way.

176
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:44,654
So there's a lot at stake for

177
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,115
every one of us if we want a

178
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:47,698
shot in this game, and this is

179
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,616
definitely the biggest challenge

180
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,744
yet.

181
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,878
>> Well, did we get tree mail?

182
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:01,629
>> So...?

183
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,672
>> Let's read it.

184
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,425

185
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:06,717
One for you.

186
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,553
>> I'll have this.

187
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,888
>> "Head to head, face to face,

188
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,181
here's another to get your heads

189
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,057
spinning.

190
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:13,641
Getting away from camp and a

191
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,726
feast is what you'll end up

192
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,103
winning."

193
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,187
>> "Here's another to get your

194
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,772
heads spinning."

195
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,023
>> Spinning.

196
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,817
>> "Here's another to get your

197
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,818
heads spinning.

198
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:24,819
Getting away from camp..."

199
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,821
>> BOTH: "And a feast."

200
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,864
>> "Is what you'll end up

201
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,656
winning?"

202
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:28,865
>> Oh!

203
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,615
Oh!

204
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,700
>> It could be a merge.

205
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,493
It could be a merge.

206
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:32,702
>> Oh!

207
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,579
>> Merge. It could be a merge.

208
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,122
>> I just want it to say,

209
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:36,956
"Let's go eat."

210
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,748
Whoever wins this challenge

211
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,749
today-- they apparently, get

212
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,667
this huge feast, and I get

213
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,627
excited when I hear anything

214
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,670
that starts with an "F."

215
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,671
(laughs)

216
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,965
>> Y'all, we got to win a feast.

217
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,008
>> I think it's a merge.

218
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,050
>> I think it's a reward

219
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,051
challenge.

220
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:49,886
>> Let's take bets.

221
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,429
I'll eat your parts of the feast

222
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,263
if it's a merge.

223
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,264
>> No. I'm not sharing mine.

224
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,265
>> No. Let's just win whatever

225
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,057
it is.

226
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,058
>> Whatever it is, we'll win.

227
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,310
>> I'm real hard on myself when

228
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,060
I lose.

229
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:58,895
I hate losing.

230
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,021
I'm a sore loser.

231
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:00,646
So, if it's a merge, ball game's

232
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,398
on.

233
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,983
That's the reason maybe I'm

234
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,026
kind of hoping it's a challenge.

235
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:05,610
I don't know if I'm ready yet,

236
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,112
but, uh, I feel like I got to

237
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,864
redeem myself.

238
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,615
It's really fixing to hit the

239
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,742
fan.

240
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,725
>> Oh, wow, dude!

241
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,560
(cheering)

242
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,646
>> There's candy!

243
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,605
(cheering)

244
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,982
>> Give me some water without

245
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,652
bugs in it!

246
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,611
>> J.T., you have a sultry

247
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,737
voice; you do the honors.

248
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,696
>> Let's hear it, big guy.

249
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,823
>> "Congratulations, tribes.

250
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,866
You have merged."

251
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,076
(all cheering)

252
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,743
"...Replace your old

253
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,577
buffs with the new.

254
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,704
>> I love the green.

255
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,330
>> "You must come up with a new

256
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,290
tribe name, design a new tribe

257
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,917
flag and begin the next phase of

258
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,252
your adventure.

259
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,211
You will all live at the old

260
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,587
Timbira camp.

261
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:06,921
>> All right!

262
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,965
>> "All of your personal reward

263
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,715
items will be at your new camp

264
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,176
when you arrive.

265
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,719
Good luck. Enjoy your feast."

266
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,055
>> Yeah!

267
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:16,973
(cheering)

268
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,015
>> Let's eat!

269
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,308
>> Pig out, man!

270
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,518
>> Our biggest hope was that

271
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,478
today was the merge feast.

272
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,729
Less the merge than the merge

273
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,231
feast.

274
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,525
Jalapao is freaking hungry.

275
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,985
>> Those are real good.

276
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,944
>> Those are real good!

277
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,737
>> I was going crazy!

278
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,321
>> Yeah, Tyson's kind of like

279
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,782
a girl.

280
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,074
>> A toast?

281
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,242
>> Yeah.

282
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,159
>> Here's to<i> Survivor</i> and all of

283
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,661
us for making it, trying our

284
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,745
hardest and the merge.

285
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,037
Hear, hear!

286
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:40,830
>> Hear, hear!

287
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,291
>> Clink, clink, clink!

288
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,792
>> The feast, man, was cool

289
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,626
because we're meeting new

290
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,043
people.

291
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,128
You know, it's like getting

292
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,045
a new girlfriend.

293
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,046
There's all kinds of things to

294
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,881
explore.

295
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,883
(screaming)

296
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,176
I just wish we could have

297
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,094
decimated the tribe a little

298
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,262
bit more.

299
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:56,804
We had them on the ropes.

300
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,639
They were going to go down and

301
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,223
I think we could have won the

302
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,850
rest of them.

303
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,726
But it's all good.

304
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,394
We're in control, baby.

305
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:03,978
We're in control.

306
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:04,645
We can be in control for the

307
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,021
rest of the way.

308
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,897
>> So, anybody got any

309
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,940
history, secrets, and stuff?

310
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,108
I don't have nothing.

311
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,151
I'm a poor cattle farmer.

312
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:10,860
>> And you're a rocket

313
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,235
scientist, though.

314
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,403
>> Yeah, I am a rocket

315
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,070
scientist.

316
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,779
>> What do y'all...

317
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,155
what do you do?

318
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,573
>> I'm a soccer coach, but also

319
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,324
a symphony conductor in

320
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,491
California.

321
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:17,992
>> Symphony instructor?

322
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,785
>> Conductor, I'm a<i> maestro.</i>

323
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,912
So I do... I have two jobs.

324
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,663
I fly back and forth between

325
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,372
the two.

326
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:23,956
I like J.T., man.

327
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,332
He's a warrior.

328
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,292
I'm looking forward to getting

329
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,626
to know him.

330
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,377
And Stephen, I mean, he's

331
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,545
obviously intelligent and as

332
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:30,463
long as... I mean, I look

333
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,380
forward to these individual

334
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,006
immunity challenges, especially

335
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,883
in the beginning when we've got

336
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,967
all the big horses and alpha

337
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:35,760
males together.

338
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,844
That's gonna be awesome.

339
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,386
>> We need a new tribe name,

340
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,888
you guys.

341
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,139
>> Anybody know Portuguese?

342
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,057
>> I looked up "Will to

343
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,392
Overcome" and that was<i> dingus,</i>

344
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,977
I guess, d-i-n-g-u-s.

345
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,811
>> In Portuguese?

346
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,062
>> Yeah.

347
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,438
>> I don't know about dingus,

348
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,397
man; I mean, that sounds like

349
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,565
a good meaning, but dingus

350
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,649
sounds a little bit too crazy.

351
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,442
>> I can't hear Jeff saying,

352
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,110
"Come on in, Dingus."

353
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:53,944
>> I'm in!

354
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,570
>> I think it has a nice ring

355
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:54,779
to it.

356
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,821
>> Any other suggestions?

357
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,822
>> Forza.

358
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,158
F-o-r-z-a is like strength in

359
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,409
Portuguese.

360
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,619
>> Forza.

361
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,079
>> Forza, which means strength.

362
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,205
>> Easy to say.

363
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:04,997
It took us, like, three days to

364
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,083
get Jalapao down.

365
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,292
>> I know it's a touchy subject,

366
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,044
but if we don't want to talk

367
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,003
about it now, that's fine.

368
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,880
We're just shocked by the last

369
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,424
two votes.

370
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,761
>> Good.

371
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,762
>> Yeah.

372
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,013
>> So, you guys didn't come up

373
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,056
with the idea of who was going

374
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:22,723
home?

375
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,724
It was kind of just, like, off

376
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,476
the cuff?

377
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,102
>> It was so... it was so big.

378
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,353
I don't know.

379
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,229
It's hard to talk about 'cause

380
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:28,979
it was so big, you know?

381
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,022
>> I was sort of tiptoeing

382
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,232
around Sierra because you do

383
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:31,857
need to be discreet with how

384
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,485
much information you give out.

385
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,903
You know, these are your future

386
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,946
competitors, so you can't just

387
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,365
be giving away your entire tribe

388
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,449
dynamic.

389
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:40,950
>> You guys are all great

390
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,784
competitors, and it's been a lot

391
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,702
of fun, you know, competing

392
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,578
against you.

393
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,538
>> So are you guys.

394
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,414
>> And when you guys win, I

395
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:46,997
think we all appreciate, you

396
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,082
know, definitely how well you've

397
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,667
done.

398
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,543
>> Well, thanks.

399
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,502
>> I was really worried about

400
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,420
the merge because

401
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,546
traditionally, if you're

402
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,630
outnumbered four to six going

403
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,589
into a merge, you're sitting

404
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:55,923
ducks.

405
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,842
>> Y'all got some fishing holes.

406
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,510
>> You've got to catch us fish.

407
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,136
We have not eaten a fish yet.

408
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:00,970
>> Fish man right there.

409
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,847
>> I'm really worried about

410
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,139
the numbers.

411
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,890
I hope that there's a power

412
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,183
struggle in the old Timbira

413
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:06,976
and I can exploit that.

414
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,688
Going into this four on six,

415
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,315
that's not good odds.

416
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,204
>> Welcome to your new house.

417
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,038
>> Thanks.

418
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,206
>> Look at that umbrella.

419
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,666
Look at all the pots we got.

420
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,584
>> Awesome.

421
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,460
>> Oh, my God!

422
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,461
>> Let's put that tarp out, like

423
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,086
right away.

424
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,421
>> It's like a real fixer-upper.

425
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,338
>> Hey, guys.

426
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,006
It's raining.

427
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,508
Let's put the tarp up.

428
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,676
>> Oh, my God.

429
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,261
>> I'm soaking wet.

430
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:42,928
>> That tarp is only as big as

431
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,889
that one spot right there.

432
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,973
>> You know, we're walking into

433
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,308
the old Timbira camp, and first

434
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,851
of all, we come up to a little

435
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,935
dog house shelter, and I'm like,

436
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,979
"What is this?"

437
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,522
You know, I mean, I don't know

438
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,023
how it was still standing.

439
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,108
>> We should take this top off,

440
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,443
just start pulling everything

441
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,027
off and then just rebuild it.

442
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,279
Not rebuild necessarily the

443
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,697
bottom, but take the top off,

444
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,823
just pull it all off, and then

445
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,324
just start from scratch.

446
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,034
>> You guys, should we do a tour

447
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,243
and show everybody the back

448
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,328
beach and the front beach and

449
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,579
all that before... so they have

450
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,206
kind of a feeling of the camp?

451
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,999
>> Yeah.

452
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,834
>> We got a pot full of beans

453
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,211
out there that's about half

454
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,045
cooked.

455
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,546
>> Let's see the tour.

456
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,006
>> The Timbira people are

457
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,216
definitely running the show.

458
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:20,966
It's definitely intimidating to

459
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,009
go into the merge down in

460
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,010
numbers.

461
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,221
They can pick us off if they

462
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,430
want, you know.

463
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,640
We're dependent on their good

464
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,474
graces.

465
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,934
So, even if we make allies with

466
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,644
them, those allies are in the

467
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,061
dominant position.

468
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,313
>> It's not near as big as you'd

469
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,106
think, is it?

470
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,901
You fish much?

471
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,195
>> Yeah, I do, uh... I do mainly

472
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:41,946
fly-fishing.

473
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,782
It's just, uh... I like the art

474
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,450
of... of the cast.

475
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,203
But, uh... I'm by no means an

476
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,331
expert.

477
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:52,957
(laughing)

478
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,083
>> You see them jumping at it?

479
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:54,542
>> I see.

480
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,125
I felt it as soon as I put it

481
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,043
in there, man.

482
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,170
I knew the first time that I...

483
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,672
that I looked at J.T.-- I saw

484
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,633
the cowboy boots, open, honest

485
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,885
face, and I said to myself,

486
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,095
"He is a good old boy."

487
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,221
We're kindred spirits.

488
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,681
We both love the outdoors.

489
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,181
I think that we're both

490
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,683
warriors.

491
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,725
Let's talk about the game a

492
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,643
little bit while we're fishing,

493
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,477
man.

494
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,187
How about it?

495
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,147
>> Man, I'm... I'm up for

496
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,941
anything, man.

497
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,609
It's not even 15 minutes, and

498
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,152
Coach is ready to talk about the

499
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,320
game.

500
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,406
And it was perfect.

501
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,031
I mean, I was... I couldn't wait

502
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,701
to talk to him about the game.

503
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,244
From what I know, Brendan

504
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,204
thinks he's in control of the

505
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,205
game pretty much.

506
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,623
>> Who told you that?

507
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:34,915
>> Taj.

508
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,586
I'm 95% sure he's got the idol.

509
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,254
>> So, you swear to me that Taj

510
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,088
does not have it.

511
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,214
>> I don't know if she's got it

512
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,007
or not.

513
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,134
If she does, there's two idols.

514
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,511
>> That's crazy.

515
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,846
All right, I'm going to tell

516
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,346
you a couple of things.

517
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,516
Um, when we talk, for now, let's

518
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,685
keep it confidential.

519
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,644
>> 100%, dude.

520
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,687
>> Just between you and I.

521
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,188
I said in the very beginning of

522
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,857
this game to everybody, I will

523
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,859
not lie one time on this game,

524
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,319
so let's just keep it honest

525
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,278
between us.

526
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,487
Let's keep it real.

527
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,905
>> I'll keep it real, Coach.

528
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,365
I've seen cracks right away.

529
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,450
I had some ideas before I

530
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,618
ever... before there ever was a

531
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,243
merge.

532
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,620
It's hard to keep six people

533
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,912
from different walks of life to

534
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,205
stick together when they hate

535
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,123
each other.

536
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,666
So, I'm just here to make sure

537
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,751
everybody hates each other.

538
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,169
If Brendan... if Brendan has got

539
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,795
that idol, we got... we're going

540
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,338
to have to blindside him.

541
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,632
>> I have a lot of emotions

542
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,341
going on.

543
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,925
I have said that I felt Brendan

544
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,384
was maybe a little bit

545
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,178
squirrelly, but if you flat out

546
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,180
lied to me, you better be

547
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,892
prepared to go to war.

548
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,938
I talked to J.T.

549
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,939
>> Mm-hmm.

550
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,523
>> And the reason why I did is

551
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,692
because I told you in the very

552
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,318
beginning, you know, that he and

553
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,694
I had, like, this rapport...

554
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,695
>> Mm-hmm.

555
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,697
>> ...without talking.

556
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,324
I know him; he's a good old boy.

557
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,700
Well, check this out.

558
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,243
Brendan has the idol.

559
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,244
>> I thought so.

560
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,580
>> I want you to think about an

561
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,625
alliance with Stephen and J.T.

562
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,876
>> Here's what we do.

563
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,002
Me, you, J.T., Stephen, Debbie.

564
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,296
We keep that five, we can take

565
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,297
it.

566
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,215
>> It's time to go for the

567
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,216
jugular.

568
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,133
Brendan is the head of the

569
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,134
dragon.

570
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,302
When you want to defeat the

571
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,387
army, you cut off the head of

572
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,137
the dragon.

573
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,430
For him to go out as the first

574
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,182
person from the merge...

575
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,769
Mm, yes, I love it.

576
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,397
I mean, that's awesome.

577
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,462
>> Oh, good.

578
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,590
All right.

579
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,591
We've definitely found inroads

580
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,384
into Timbira.

581
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,135
This is clearly a very fractured

582
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,138
tribe because there's no strong

583
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,223
bonds and sense of place, so

584
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,725
there's a lot of power dynamics

585
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,184
at play that are very easy to

586
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,395
exploit.

587
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,524
>> Yeah.

588
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,072
(laughing)

589
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,345
>> I want you to catch one.

590
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,221
>> Okay.

591
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:36,805
>> Just put it out as far as

592
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,307
it can reach.

593
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,558
>> Should I keep bringing it

594
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,267
out and...

595
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,809
>> No, you can leave it in

596
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,894
there.

597
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,061
Unless the... took it off

598
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:43,854
already.

599
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,813
>> I got one, dude.

600
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,230
>> Huh, pull it up.

601
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,067
Pull it in.

602
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,861
Oh, it's a little baby catfish.

603
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,862
Pull him all the way in.

604
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,654
Catfish-- let me tell ya, they

605
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,156
got little fins that are, they

606
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,240
supposedly poisonous.

607
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,325
>> Oh, really?

608
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,202
>> See, he's got little razors

609
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,203
on the back of them fins.

610
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,038
See, watch him close them down

611
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,039
on me.

612
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,123
>> I was hoping for a big one.

613
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:03,540
>> Ow. Look at this.

614
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,292
What kind of catfish is this?

615
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,877
>> (laughs) I don't know!

616
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,045
A dangerous one?

617
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,379
>> It is.

618
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,923
I'll put him back.

619
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,340
That little bastard.

620
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,883
...right there.

621
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,677
I expected to not get along

622
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,054
with Tyson at all.

623
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:17,638
We talked a lot of smack at

624
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,223
each other, pushed each other

625
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,433
around, and now, you know, when

626
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,101
you get on the same tribe and

627
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,020
you go for individual immunity,

628
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:25,604
you're still competing against

629
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,271
the guy, but you're living with

630
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,856
him.

631
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,274
It's a little different now.

632
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,692
Stephen's the only guy that I

633
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,194
can vouch for 100%.

634
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,278
You know, so...

635
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,196
>> And with me it's Coach, and

636
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,114
as far as...

637
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,198
>> That's what Coach told me.

638
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,157
Whatever y'all wanna do, I'm

639
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:37,991
with y'all.

640
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:38,659
>> 'Cause I was thinking of

641
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,535
getting rid of Brendan like,

642
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,369
since, like, two or three

643
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,246
eliminations ago.

644
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,372
>> He's gonna be surprised as

645
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:43,539
hell.

646
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,251
>> I'm one of the guys that...

647
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,836
>> I'd like to get rid of

648
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,753
Brendan.

649
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,796
He's the biggest threat.

650
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,755
He just seems like a sneaky

651
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,381
bastard, you know.

652
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,508
I can't look him in the eye

653
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,134
and believe a word he says.

654
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,386
You can look me in my sweet blue

655
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,055
eyes all day and I'll tell you

656
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:00,973
sweet nothings and you'll

657
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,183
believe all of them.

658
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,563
Debbie, you want to go, uh, grab

659
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,814
some firewood?

660
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,690
Do you think we need some?

661
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,066
>> Sure.

662
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,317
We'll go grab some of the

663
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:16,154
timber and logs, yeah.

664
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:16,989
>> I'll grab that log on that

665
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:21,201
back beach, at least.

666
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,537
>> After the two tribes merged,

667
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,581
I was thinking we're probably

668
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,331
safe, Stephen and myself,

669
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,209
because of the secret alliance

670
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,670
that we have between us and

671
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,212
Brendan and Sierra.

672
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,380
But they haven't even made any

673
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,883
signs or signals, so, it kind

674
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,425
of, it makes me think that

675
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,343
they're going to stick behind

676
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,929
their tribe right now.

677
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:41,889
I went into Exile with Brendan

678
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,723
three times.

679
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,473
>> What do you think is going

680
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:43,640
on?

681
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,142
>> I don't know.

682
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:45,893
I don't know.

683
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,935
I can't tell if he's still with

684
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,978
us or not.

685
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,062
I can't tell at all.

686
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,856
I just, I feel like he's not

687
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,608
doing the things that he was

688
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,817
saying he was going to do

689
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,944
before.

690
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,365
>> My Exile alliance with Taj,

691
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,160
Sierra, and Stephen is still

692
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,202
kind of laying low, which is

693
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,913
what I think it needs to do

694
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,623
because that alliance is only

695
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,291
effective once the numbers get

696
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,792
down to seven or eight.

697
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,336
And so, right now, Joe needs to

698
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,880
go, J.T. needs to go, and then

699
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,131
my Exile alliance can kind of

700
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,258
take charge if need be.

701
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,301
>> Coach talked with J.T.

702
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,428
last night really good.

703
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,179
>> Okay.

704
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,055
>> J.T.'s a straight shooter,

705
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:23,805
good guy.

706
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,431
>> Okay.

707
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,015
>> He said he trusted Stephen

708
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:25,432
with all his life.

709
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,266
>> Okay.

710
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,434
>> Here's the alliance now.

711
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:32,856
You, me, Coach, J.T., Stephen.

712
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,482
>> I like J.T. and Stephen both.

713
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,358
>> They're both...

714
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,442
>> Straight shooters.

715
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,360
>> Here he comes.

716
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,320
>> Okay.

717
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,363
>> Wood?

718
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,782
>> Do you think Joe?

719
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,783
>> Yeah, I think so.

720
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,368
What do you think?

721
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,496
>> That's what I thought.

722
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,289
I mean, he's injured, so he's

723
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:49,915
not going to be able to compete

724
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,750
at stuff, don't you think?

725
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,292
>> Um, yeah.

726
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,002
>> I was going to go grab that

727
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:54,628
log because it was easy, but...

728
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,255
and it burned long, but if not,

729
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,632
we'll just, where should we go?

730
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,675
Anywhere?

731
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,968
>> We don't have much time.

732
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,760
>> Yeah, we only need the little

733
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,761
stuff.

734
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,012
>> I talked with Brendan, and,

735
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,806
uh, I just wanted to kind of

736
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,431
let him feel like that I was

737
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,391
still on board with whatever

738
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,517
plan he had.

739
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,769
I do feel proud being a better

740
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,270
schemer than Brendan.

741
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,146
He's supposed to be this

742
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,649
big-league businessman who gets

743
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,525
businesses rolling, makes them

744
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,652
tons of money.

745
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,237
He's like putty in my hands.

746
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,196
I can mold this game however I

747
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,739
I want right now.

748
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,740
>> Okay, first of all, did you

749
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,118
find yours?

750
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,786
>> Found it?

751
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,370
>> Uh-huh?

752
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,123
>> I got to get back to camp.

753
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,584
(laughing)

754
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,127
>> Based on the clues from

755
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,379
Exile, I was able to figure out

756
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,464
that there were most likely two

757
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,924
idols, and Joe and I decided

758
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,175
that we were going to work

759
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,218
together and see if we can maybe

760
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,219
find both.

761
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,053
>> So, you don't know where it

762
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:45,929
is?

763
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,223
>> Oh, no, not at all.

764
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,391
>> I can't even trust you.

765
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,976
(giggling)

766
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,269
I don't know what you're doing.

767
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,770
It's a simple question.

768
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,521
I'm asking if you have the

769
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,148
immunity idol.

770
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,942
>> I don't have it.

771
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,401
We're here.

772
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,404
>> You know where it is?

773
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:02,738
You bend over.

774
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,072
>> Yeah.

775
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:04,865
>> Do this.

776
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,033
>> Yeah.

777
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:06,658
>> It's not there.

778
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,035
>> It's not there anymore.

779
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:08,952
>> The idol is not there.

780
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:09,494
>> Yeah.

781
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,037
There was a very specific

782
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,621
pocket where something should

783
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,998
have been on the back of that

784
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,291
tree mail post.

785
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,876
There's nothing in there.

786
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,501
So, we can assume that Brendan

787
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,795
or Sierra has the idol.

788
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,421
We'll vote them both out and,

789
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,882
uh, then we can actually play

790
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,426
the game for real.

791
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:41,610
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

792
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,611
How's everybody doing?

793
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,361
>> Awesome.

794
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,029
>> Great.

795
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,197
>> PROBST: J.T., what's the name

796
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,198
of the new tribe?

797
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,240
>> Forza.

798
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,200
>> PROBST: What's Forza mean?

799
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:48,825
>> I believe it means "strength"

800
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,576
in Portuguese.

801
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,452
>> PROBST: All right, Forza is

802
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,578
the new tribe name.

803
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,412
You guys ready to get to

804
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,122
today's challenge?

805
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:54,748
>> Yep.

806
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:54,956
>> Yeah.

807
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,333
>> PROBST: All right, first

808
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,375
things first, Debra: I will

809
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,671
take tribal immunity back.

810
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,467
Tribal immunity, no more.

811
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,009
We're now in the individual

812
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,136
portion of the game.

813
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,471
This is what you covet.

814
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,598
A beautiful individual immunity

815
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,100
necklace.

816
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,309
If you're wearing this,

817
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,394
you're safe in this game.

818
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,228
Cannot be voted out.

819
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:16,812
If you don't have immunity,

820
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,272
you are vulnerable.

821
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,190
Today's challenge is very

822
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,066
simple.

823
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,400
Each of you will hold on to a

824
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,737
pole for as long as you can.

825
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,239
>> Oh, man.

826
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:27,989
>> PROBST: When you fall off the

827
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,824
pole, you're out of the

828
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,658
challenge.

829
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,035
Last person left hanging on the

830
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,079
pole wins immunity, is safe at

831
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:34,704
least one more day in this game.

832
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,998
Losers, Tribal Council, where

833
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,625
one of you will be voted out.

834
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,459
Big stakes.

835
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,794
We'll draw for spots and get

836
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,463
started.

837
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,849
This challenge is officially on.

838
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,275
>> I love you, pole.

839
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,112
>> PROBST: Stephen struggling

840
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,071
early.

841
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:08,780
>> I've got a lot of limbs

842
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,948
here, Jeff.

843
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,576
>> More than the rest of us?

844
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,162
>> PROBST: Joe, now struggling.

845
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,917
>> I know.

846
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,961
Salvaged.

847
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:23,670
>> PROBST: Joe really

848
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:28,216
struggling.

849
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,344
Finds a new resting spot.

850
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:35,140
Stephen struggling to hang on.

851
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:35,974
Stephen is the first one out

852
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,058
of the challenge.

853
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,061
Take a spot on the bench.

854
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:40,729
Joe now, starting to slip down

855
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,815
his pole.

856
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,568
Joe struggling to hang on.

857
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,570
That wood raking against the

858
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,654
chest.

859
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,282
Joe is out of the challenge.

860
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,409
(frustrated yell)

861
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,416
>> PROBST: Wow, what is going on

862
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,542
with that?

863
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,169
>> Uh, it's infect...

864
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,545
My knee's infected, man.

865
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,465
It just... it won't go away.

866
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,507
>> PROBST: It doesn't look good.

867
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,219
>> No, it doesn't feel good.

868
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,889
>> PROBST: Taj now having a

869
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,475
little trouble.

870
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,851
Brendan slipping a little bit.

871
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,144
>> I hate this challenge.

872
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,396
>> This hurts.

873
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,611
>> PROBST: J.T. now having a

874
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,738
little movement.

875
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,700
Sierra has not budged.

876
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,785
Debra has not budged.

877
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,162
Coach and Tyson haven't budged.

878
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,830
>> Ooh, aah!

879
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,958
>> PROBST: Taj now struggling.

880
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,504
Brendan drops out of the

881
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,797
challenge.

882
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,175
Taj right behind Brendan.

883
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,177
And Erinn, three people out in

884
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,097
succession.

885
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,140
We are now down to five:

886
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,894
Sierra, Debra, J.T., Coach,

887
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:03,645
and Tyson.

888
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,689
All vying for that first

889
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,108
individual immunity.

890
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,192
The only way to make sure you

891
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,111
are safe tonight is to have

892
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,238
that necklace around your neck.

893
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,881
>> Sierra, you're doing awesome.

894
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,011

J.T. drops out of the challenge.

897
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,274
We are now down to four.

898
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,986
>> All from old Timbira.

899
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,279
>> PROBST: So, Coach, does that

900
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,322
mean Timbira's still going

901
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,031
strong?

902
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,032
There's no merge?

903
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,991
>> We are going strong.

904
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,452
We're going strong, baby.

905
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,662
>> Dude, you did awesome.

906
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,543

907
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,129
down the pole.

00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:15,675
Coach is now out.

909
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,010
Sierra struggling for the first

910
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,721
time in this challenge.

911
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,806
>> Ow!

912
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,849
Oh, that hurt.

913
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,433
>> PROBST: Are you all right?

914
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,435
That was a hard landing, wow.

915
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,062
>> Good job, though.

916
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:27,854
>> PROBST: That post got every

917
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,772
part of your body on the way

918
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,981
down.

919
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,983
>> You can do it, little Debbie!

920
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,276
>> PROBST: We are now down to

921
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,903
two people left in this

922
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,112
challenge:

923
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,574
Debra and Tyson.

924
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,116
Sometimes it is the simplest

925
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,701
challenges that prove the most

926
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,828
trying.

927
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,840
>> Okay, this really is

928
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,884

Tyson hanging on by a couple of

932
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,892
toes.

933
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:06,935
>> Tyson, you be careful you

934
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,853
don't fall off.

935
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,772
>> Don't boss me around, lady.

936
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,524
>> I just don't want you to

937
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,858
break your pretty little face.

938
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,234
>> That's true.

939
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,735
It is my money maker.

940
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,778
>> I know.

941
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,740
(laughing)

942
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,492

>> PROBST: Debra really

944
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:23,910
struggling.

945
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,994
She is the last thing keeping

946
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,955
Tyson from immunity.

947
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,709
>> Debra!

948
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,252
>> Debra drops out of the

949
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,670
challenge.

950
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,296
Tyson wins first individual

951
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,048
immunity.

952
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,175
>> Nice job.

953
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,724
>> PROBST: Tyson, come on over.

954
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,726
>> Good job, Tyson.

955
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,729
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

956
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,272
Tyson's safe at tonight's

957
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:52,939
Tribal Council.

958
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,816
The rest of you, one of you

959
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,693
guys going home tonight.

960
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,068
Grab your stuff.

961
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:57,777
Head back to camp.

962
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,528
Joe, stay behind.

963
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,446
I want to have medical take a

964
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,113
look.

965
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,030
Everybody else head back to

966
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,157
camp.

967
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,575
Congrats.

968
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,033
>> Am I staying here?

969
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,493
>> PROBST: I just want to have

970
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,453
medical take a look at you.

971
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,162
Can we get medical to come in

972
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,289
and take a look at Joe?

973
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,167
>> It's real scary right now

974
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,209
because I'm having to trust

975
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,794
people I just met.

976
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,336
You know, what I gotta do is

977
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,465
just remain strong to what I

978
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,007
hope is a firm alliance.

979
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,758
You know, I really don't have

980
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,593
any other options.

981
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,218
I have to trust Coach and Tyson

982
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:22,886
right now.

983
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,597
And if I'm still here tomorrow,

984
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,348
I'm not worried about old

985
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,559
Timbira anymore.

986
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,369
>> Yeah, that, that hurt.

987
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,078
>> That's sore.

988
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,246
>> Yeah, that's sore.

989
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,331
>> PROBST: You feel it more?

990
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,999
>> Yeah.

991
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,667
>> PROBST: You're not sounding

992
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,169
optimistic, Lucy.

993
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,880
>> This is really swollen, so, I

994
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,215
have to make an assumption that

995
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,633
there's a bunch of pus under

996
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,927
there, um...

997
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,094
>> PROBST: I got a question,

998
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,012
too, at this point.

999
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:06,888
What's your take?

1000
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,806
Are you... you still want to

1001
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,933
stay in the game?

1002
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,100
>> I want to stay in the game.

1003
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:11,476
>> PROBST: Okay.

1004
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,769
>> Yeah, I mean, I want you all

1005
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,354
to tell me if you don't go home

1006
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,355
right now, you're going to lose

1007
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,105
the leg.

1008
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:16,356
>> Yeah.

1009
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,358
>> PROBST: What's at risk for

1010
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,025
him right now?

1011
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:19,859
What are you most concerned

1012
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,194
about, Lucy?

1013
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,570
>> Unfortunately, because this

1014
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,113
infection is so close to the

1015
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,157
bone, is that the infection

1016
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,368
could actually enter your bone,

1017
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,828
and that's a bad infection.

1018
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,831
Um, the other risk is that the

1019
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,916
infection goes to your blood,

1020
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,252
and that's extremely dangerous.

1021
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,087
In that regard, that can risk

1022
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,130
death.

1023
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,259
This won't heal itself tomorrow.

1024
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,932
>> Very beautiful.

1025
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,891
>> Right on the lips.

1026
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,601
>> I love you.

1027
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,644
>> I love you, too, sweetie.

1028
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,853
Here, want to try it on?

1029
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,564
>> Yeah.

1030
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,566
>> Yeah, so, I kick ass, like I

1031
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,819
always do, and, uh, if any

1032
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,112
ladies want my phone number,

1033
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:08,658
I guess, uh... ask.

1034
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,994
(thunder rumbling)

1035
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:11,995
>> Wowee.

1036
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,539
Is it going to rain all

1037
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,959
afternoon?

1038
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,460
>> We immediately knew

1039
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,837
something was up with Joe

1040
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,046
because he hadn't come back

1041
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,964
from the immunity challenge.

1042
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,384
>> I hope Joe's okay.

1043
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,177
>> Oh, yeah.

1044
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,721
>> We're hoping we can take out

1045
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,097
Brendan tonight.

1046
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,181
But, honestly, I've known these

1047
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,017
people for two days.

1048
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,059
They're obviously crafty people.

1049
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,228
That's why they're out here.

1050
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,354
So, I don't trust anyone, but

1051
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,480
you've got to go with your gut

1052
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,440
sometimes in this game.

1053
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,232
You gotta make desperate

1054
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,400
moves sometimes in this game,

1055
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,610
and I think this is one of them

1056
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,653
for me.

1057
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,821
>> Are your forearms all

1058
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:47,113
jacked up?

1059
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,031
>> I only held with my fingers

1060
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,158
and my toes the whole time.

1061
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,075
Even coming down, I just

1062
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:51,326
like...

1063
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,744
>> You were probably smart to

1064
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,536
not have shoes on.

1065
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,245
>> When I climbed down a

1066
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,121
little bit, like, it loosened me

1067
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:55,997
up.

1068
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,206
>> That's how I fell off,

1069
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,792
when I went to stretch.

1070
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,335
>> I kept trying to do that.

1071
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,086
>> Mine kept falling out.

1072
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,839
I couldn't get it to stay in.

1073
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,941
>> Lying to everybody,

1074
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,443
especially Brendan and Sierra,

1075
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,194
actually brings me pleasure.

1076
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,154
In my alliance now, Stephen and

1077
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,406
J.T. have replaced Brendan and

1078
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,616
Sierra.

1079
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,368
I never liked Sierra ever.

1080
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,452
I have no clue why she's out

1081
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,953
here other than to just give

1082
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,996
hope to stupid people around the

1083
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,290
world.

1084
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,544
>> Hey, it's the way it is, man.

1085
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,462
>> I know, I know.

1086
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,088
>> It's the way it is.

1087
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,215
>> That's the way it is.

1088
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,011
>> And Brendan, he's really the

1089
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,346
sneakiest bastard I have to

1090
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,806
worry about.

1091
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,683
We smile at each other; we hug.

1092
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,642
I've kissed him on the neck

1093
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,018
softly.

1094
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,688
He's felt my warm, steamy breath

1095
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,313
on the nape of his neck, even on

1096
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,023
the small of his back.

1097
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,568
But, you know, as the old adage

1098
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,194
goes, keep your friends close

1099
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,195
and your enemies closer.

1100
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,322
That's right, right?

1101
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,326
>> Here's the thing: if I go

1102
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,244
with you, you know...

1103
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,996
There's two basic alliances,

1104
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,789
right.

1105
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,998
I know I can get to the final

1106
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,126
four with Taj and Brendan.

1107
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,419
And I will go with you, with

1108
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,003
Coach, Tyson, and Debbie now if

1109
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:26,629
you promise me you will turn on

1110
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,797
them when the time comes.

1111
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,923
>> I will...

1112
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,258
>> All right, we just want to

1113
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:30,717
talk.

1114
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,259
I just want to ask you guys.

1115
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,385
>> Yeah.

1116
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,594
>> Um, we're doing the beans

1117
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,470
right now.

1118
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:34,762
>> Right.

1119
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,972
>> And then we're going to add

1120
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,014
a little bit of rice to them.

1121
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:37,265
>> Okay.

1122
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,057
>> And then we'll, so, we'll

1123
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,517
eat, we'll just split it up and

1124
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,685
then in a couple of hours, we'll

1125
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,602
split it up again.

1126
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,270
Good?

1127
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:42,645
>> That's cool.

1128
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,771
>> Okay.

1129
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,231
>> We're trying to get

1130
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,358
everything straight.

1131
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,528
>> If it's five, five, we gotta

1132
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,779
stay...

1133
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,114
>> I will get Erinn... I will

1134
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,324
get Erinn to go to do this.

1135
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,118
But she's not in on it still.

1136
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:57,535
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1137
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,205
>> Got it.

1138
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,754
>> What a mess.

1139
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,337
>> We done with our awkward

1140
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,505
conversations?

1141
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,174
>> Yeah, man.

1142
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:14,343
>> Get over here.

1143
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,344
>> Is Joe back yet?

1144
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,846
>> No.

1145
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,597
>> Is it bad to fish in the

1146
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,639
middle of the day in the rain?

1147
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,016
>> It may be good to fish in

1148
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,017
the rain.

1149
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,768
You all want to try to eat some

1150
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,185
fish before we go?

1151
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,104
>> Yeah, we got plenty of time.

1152
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:29,817
>> We got plenty of...

1153
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,902
>> You guys want to go?

1154
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,319
>> Not right now.

1155
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,111
I'll meet you.

1156
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,070
I'll come down there later.

1157
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:33,821
>> I might come down in a bit,

1158
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,489
too.

1159
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,573
I like it down there.

1160
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,741
>> All right.

1161
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,366
>> There's definitely a

1162
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,242
scenario where I could be in

1163
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,327
trouble, within Timbira; my old

1164
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,121
Timbira tribe senses something.

1165
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,122
If it's going on with Stephen

1166
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,957
and Taj and myself, they might

1167
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:45,792
say, "Let's get rid of Brendan

1168
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,959
now."

1169
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:47,835
You know, who knows?

1170
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,836
But so much of it is going to

1171
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,629
be on the fly.

1172
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,797
I'll have the immunity idol in

1173
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,173
my pocket and I'm not afraid to

1174
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,259
play it tonight.

1175
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,219
>> I feel like Brendan and

1176
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,679
Sierra haven't tried to really

1177
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,056
communicate yet.

1178
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,183
>> I know.

1179
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,688
>> Tonight?

1180
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,189
>> Yeah.

1181
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:08,731
>> How?

1182
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,524
>> I don't think that they're

1183
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,233
unified.

1184
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,568
I bet we could sway them.

1185
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,487
I think we could sway like,

1186
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,154
Coach, you know, Coach and J.T.

1187
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,365
are seriously (indistinct)

1188
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:17,907
right now, have you noticed

1189
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,699
that?

1190
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,283
>> Mm-hmm.

1191
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:19,867
>> Well, if you can pull it

1192
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,285
together, I'll do it.

1193
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:21,994
>> You will?

1194
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:22,453
>> Mm-hmm.

1195
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,037
>> I know how tight you guys

1196
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,955
are.

1197
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:24,872
>> I mean, we're cool, but like

1198
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,414
I said, we've been over here

1199
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,042
for two days now, and I haven't

1200
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:28,668
had the chance to talk to him,

1201
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,753
and I don't trust him anymore.

1202
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,838
I don't feel secure.

1203
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,631
If we were even, it would

1204
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,841
probably be different, but

1205
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,466
because he has all the numbers,

1206
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,344
it just doesn't feel good...

1207
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,971
you know?

1208
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:40,429
>> Taj, your teeth are

1209
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,806
abnormally white, too.

1210
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,849
>> So white.

1211
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,184
>> I bleach mine, too.

1212
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,811
>> I'm obsessed with my teeth.

1213
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,355
>> I'm, yeah, I'm the same.

1214
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,357
>> I knew it when we merged.

1215
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,233
I said my last hope is to talk

1216
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,609
to J.T.

1217
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,861
>> You can trust me.

1218
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,529
I know I can trust you, man.

1219
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:56,946
>> And I know that.

1220
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,614
>> Y'all just keep reassuring,

1221
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,575
you know, me or Joe.

1222
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,617
>> Well, it was perfect because

1223
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,285
you guys went out and talked and

1224
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,871
we were all in that circle, and

1225
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,497
I'm not telling any lies.

1226
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:06,914
>> Okay.

1227
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,498
>> And they were going to vote

1228
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,751
you, and you're the warrior,

1229
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,086
and we're together now, man.

1230
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,628
>> I'm on top of that, man.

1231
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,463
>> All right, listen, just don't

1232
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,548
burn me, okay.

1233
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,133
>> I won't, man.

1234
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,009
>> I just screwed my whole

1235
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,885
tribe.

1236
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,052
>> If I'm reading Coach right,

1237
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,554
he's telling me the truth.

1238
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,722
My life in this game is in his

1239
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,472
hands tonight.

1240
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,850
But, you know, this is a game

1241
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,394
for a million dollars.

1242
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,062
They're voting me tonight.

1243
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:30,855
>> What?

1244
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,648
>> Coach just said Sierra and

1245
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,399
Brendan are the only two that's

1246
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,233
going to vote me.

1247
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,818
>> That means...

1248
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,444
>> Hopefully, he won't play his

1249
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,987
idol.

1250
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,613
>> He's not going to play his

1251
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,864
idol.

1252
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,201
>> If he does, dude, I'm out.

1253
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:47,079
>> You're not going out.

1254
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,247
>> I was thinking, if, uh, and

1255
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:52,043
Brendan's going to vote me.

1256
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,336
>> Damn, it's 'cause Joe's

1257
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,253
injured.

1258
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,379
>> That's fine.

1259
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,881
If Brendan's voting me and

1260
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,381
Sierra's voting me...

1261
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,424
>> We can split votes.

1262
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,967
>> That's two.

1263
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,931
>> We can split votes.

1264
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,016
This is awesome.

1265
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,225
If Brendan plays the idol,

1266
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,268
then it doesn't matter how many

1267
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,770
of us vote for him.

1268
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,021
One of the Jalapao tribe,

1269
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,272
whoever he chooses, is going

1270
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:13,481
home.

1271
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,566
And it sounds like Brendan is

1272
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,275
targeting J.T., which is

1273
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,694
disastrous for me.

1274
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,613
So, our solution is to split

1275
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,031
the votes.

1276
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,324
We have at least four or five

1277
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,700
solid votes for Brendan.

1278
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,119
The rest of us vote for Sierra.

1279
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,246
That way, if Brendan does play

1280
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,582
the idol, Sierra's going home,

1281
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,710
and Brendan can go home next.

1282
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:38,631
>> J.T. and I were talking about

1283
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,925
splitting the vote just in case

1284
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,342
he uses his idol.

1285
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,804
So, four people, five people

1286
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,014
vote for him, and two or three

1287
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,182
vote for Sierra.

1288
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:49,725
That way he can't vote J.T. out

1289
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,559
no matter what.

1290
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,644
>> That's true. That's true.

1291
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:51,936
Let's do it.

1292
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,439
>> Yeah.

1293
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,024
>> We need to split the vote

1294
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,317
now.

1295
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,069
We need four on Brendan, three

1296
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,030
on Sierra, and then Sierra and

1297
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,865
Brendan's can go anywhere and

1298
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,449
they don't count for anything.

1299
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,410
So, whether an idol's played

1300
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,703
or not.

1301
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,371
You know?

1302
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,205
>> I gotcha.

1303
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:11,998
>> One of them goes.

1304
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,290
>> At Tribal tonight, if it goes

1305
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,543
the way that I planned it to, it

1306
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,544
will absolute shake the hell

1307
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,755
out of the foundations that

1308
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,468
were Timbira.

1309
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,391
>> Not a thing biting.

1310
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,225
>> Really?

1311
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:31,809
>> No.

1312
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,351
>> Not a thing?

1313
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:32,852
>> Nothing.

1314
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,227
>> Not the time?

1315
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,854
>> I have no patience for

1316
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:35,479
sitting around holding a rod in

1317
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,732
my hand without anything

1318
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:37,940
working.

1319
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,358
Did you catch that, Debbie?

1320
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,192
>> I got it.

1321
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:40,609
I heard it.

1322
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,902
>> So what do you want to call

1323
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:42,319
me?

1324
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,070
You want to call me

1325
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:43,738
The Orchestrator for

1326
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,031
orchestrating a beautiful move

1327
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,574
at this point in the game that

1328
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:46,907
does two things?

1329
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,243
Keeps my initial game plan

1330
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:49,744
intact and I don't have

1331
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,537
to compromise by keeping weak

1332
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,496
people around, and voting out

1333
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,457
one of the strongest, most

1334
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,417
manipulative and possibly most

1335
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,544
deceitful players to date.

1336
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,087
Or do you want to call me

1337
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,130
The Dragonslayer because I'm

1338
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:01,714
cutting the head off of the

1339
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,007
dragon?

1340
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,008
You guys call me whatever you

1341
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,009
want to because at this point

1342
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:09,430
in time, I feel brilliant!

1343
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,686
>> Is that Jeff?

1344
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,687
>> It is.

1345
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:16,937
>> Uh-oh.

1346
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,189
>> Uh-oh.

1347
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,773
>> Joe is gone.

1348
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,607
>> No.

1349
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,900
>> You know what, I'm going to

1350
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,193
give him applause for not having

1351
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:22,777
an umbrella.

1352
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,027
All right.

1353
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,403
>> PROBST: Ah, I missed you

1354
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:24,612
guys.

1355
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,489
>> You're not with Joe.

1356
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,491
>> PROBST: No, Joe's not with

1357
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,742
me.

1358
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,535
Uh, have an update.

1359
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,578
You guys left the challenge;

1360
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,704
we kept Joe behind.

1361
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,081
Medical really wanted to check

1362
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,123
out his leg.

1363
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,124
Everybody knows he's been

1364
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,751
battling a pretty decent

1365
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,668
infection.

1366
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,544
They looked at it, did

1367
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,339
a thorough assessment.

1368
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:43,756
He can't continue.

1369
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,174
>> What?!

1370
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:45,800
>> PROBST: They said the risk of

1371
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,718
him staying longer was too

1372
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,636
serious.

1373
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:48,928
>> Aw, jeez.

1374
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,638
>> PROBST: That if they left him

1375
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,931
longer in the game, that this

1376
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:52,848
could get worse.

1377
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,350
He didn't want to go.

1378
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:54,892
He asked if he could stay.

1379
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,685
He asked if he could stay

1380
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,270
another day, but he couldn't

1381
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:58,813
stay out here any longer.

1382
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,564
So he's going to be evacuated

1383
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,941
via helicopter.

1384
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:02,650
He'll be taken to the nearest

1385
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,611
city, get looked at

1386
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,654
at a hospital.

1387
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,030
They may do surgery; they're not

1388
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:08,656
sure, but either way, he'll be

1389
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,615
taken care of.

1390
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,035
So the impact on you guys is

1391
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,536
no Tribal Council.

1392
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,413
>> Ooh!

1393
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,705
I mean, I don't mean to sound

1394
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,331
so happy.

1395
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:18,958
(laughter)

1396
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,127
>> PROBST: Good news, bad news.

1397
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,462
No Tribal Council for you guys.

1398
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,880
Nobody getting voted out.

1399
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,382
Nobody else going home.

1400
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,716
>> Can you tell Joe that we love

1401
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,593
him and miss him?

1402
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,929
>> PROBST: Try to stay dry and

1403
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,681
take care of yourselves.

1404
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,850
And the game continues.

1405
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,642
I'll see you soon.

1406
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,143
>> Thanks for coming by.

1407
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,435
>> PROBST: All right, guys, good

1408
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:38,727
night.

1409
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,689
>> Thanks, bye.

1410
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,237
>> Brendan lives to see another

1411
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,029
day.

1412
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,656
I am disappointed.

1413
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,532
The main thing about getting

1414
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,576
the plan to work was keeping

1415
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,702
everybody quiet for long enough

1416
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,245
to vote him out so that he

1417
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,913
didn't use an idol if he had it.

1418
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:58,706
Now, I don't know how much is

1419
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,749
going to leak or what's going

1420
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,794
to happen, but...

1421
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,174
>> I can't wait till the next

1422
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:08,799
Tribal Council even more so now

1423
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,801
because I have had some plans

1424
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,553
in order and, uh, I think

1425
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,805
someone on the old Timbira tribe

1426
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,598
just bought themselves three

1427
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,891
days, and they don't even know

1428
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,185
it.

1429
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,603
>> So, no Tribal tonight.

1430
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,437
That sucks.

1431
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,021
You know, I mean, it's like,

1432
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,731
we've got a game plan.

1433
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,232
I'm ready for action.

1434
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,692
The Dragonslayer has to wait

1435
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,821
another day to taste blood.

1436
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,212
>> The doctor said that if I...

1437
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,922
if it got bad, which it would

1438
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,590
have if I would've stayed, that

1439
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,634
I, you know, could potentially

1440
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,846
lose my leg or lose my life.

1441
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,389
This game is cool, but it's not

1442
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,643
that cool.

1443
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,060
I-I don't want...

1444
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,686
I don't want to die.

1445
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,772
I'd rather walk home.

hibernated for a while.

1459
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,258
It's finally going to rear its

1460
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,009
ugly head.

>> We're cutting the head off

1464
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,012
the dragon.

1465
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,264
When it comes head-to-head,

1466
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,015
we'll see who really was the

1467
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:45,437
chosen one.

1468
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:45,938
>> The fact that you get

1469
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,107
blindsided literally by your

1470
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,067
own body just goes to show you

1471
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,319
that this game is...

1472
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:52,820
Anything can happen.

1473
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,613
And I think that, like,

1474
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,447
that's...

1475
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:55,990
The main lesson I learned is

1476
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,992
that generally speaking, like,

1477
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:58,909
Mother Nature's pretty awesome

1478
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,744
force, and this game is tough.

1479
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,289
I don't know.

1480
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,708
It sucks, man.
