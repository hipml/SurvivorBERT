translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:12,521
Survivor is the most 
physically demanding

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,116
and emotionally challenging 
game shows.

4
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:19,728
It spares you nothing...

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,388
Are you retiring from the game?

6
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:25,625
...while giving you the opportunity 
to show who you are.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,060
For those who win...

8
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:29,004
The winner of Survivor Cagayan!

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,978
...the reward is great: 
a million dollars,

10
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:34,669
and a peak that 
may never be reached again.

11
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:36,236
But for those who lose...

12
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39,414
Did Woo make 
a million dollar mistake?

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:43,977
...the consequence is often 
a continuous nightmare of "what if...?",

14
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:45,512
which never ends.

15
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,191
Until now.

16
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,696
I'm happy to say,

17
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:53,365
Kelly Wiglesworth: 
you will have a 2nd chance!

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,025
Get on stage!

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,417
This season, 
for the very first time,

20
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:59,905
we offer Survivor to fans.

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,294
20 former players 
who only played once

22
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:06,329
were selected 
by national vote.

23
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:10,085
They have a 2nd chance 
to finish what they started.

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,072
Some have waited 
more than a decade.

25
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:29,956
They came to Cambodia,

26
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:34,724
a country with an impressive, 
moving and powerful history

27
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:36,852
which arouses emotions.

28
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:41,744
She vividly reminds 
you that the past can haunt you

29
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,472
and provides inspiration 
to seize a 2nd chance.

30
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:48,397
15 years ago, I was in Borneo, 
the 1st season,

31
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:49,876
and I almost won.

32
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,779
Win the 1st edition 
of Survivor...

33
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:57,305
I lasted 39 days 
and lost by one vote.

34
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,294
That's why I'm here.

35
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,997
It has been tickling me for 15 years, 
little by little.

36
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,532
I am much stronger 
and much smarter.

37
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,193
I am a mother now. 
I gave life.

38
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:09,037
I can do anything at this point.

39
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,620
My life is a dream.

40
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,408
I have the perfect wife. 
My children are wonderful.

41
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,875
I have a great job.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,794
Nothing negative in my life, except...

43
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:40,602
My exit has haunted me for 12 years. 
I didn't get over it.

44
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,607
To cure my Survivor ailment, 
I have to give 1000%.

45
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,033
I will give my all in this game.

46
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,835
And it's going to be epic.

47
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,381
During my last participation,

48
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,175
frankly, I was arrogant.

49
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:57,544
Kass. 
Zero chance of winning this game.

50
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,480
I saw Survivor 
as a game of chess.

51
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:02,550
But I have matured a lot.

52
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,884
I grew emotionally.

53
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:09,236
People are not pieces, 
you have to connect humanly.

54
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,433
Being emotionally more lucid,

55
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,138
I think I am, in my life, 
in the best dispositions

56
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:15,971
to play and win this game.

57
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,452
My experience in Australia

58
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,120
was abbreviated too quickly.

59
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:36,404
I want a 2nd chance 
to achieve my dream: go all the way.

60
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:44,858
The temple of Angkor Wat 
is a perfect metaphor for the game.

61
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:49,371
We are a little damaged, 
but we can consolidate.

62
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,432
14 years is a long time

63
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,600
to finish the last chapter.

64
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:59,014
Last time 
I played with my dad.

65
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:01,372
- You mustn't give the impression... 
- No.

66
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:04,014
...to be aggressive, 
to say what to do.

67
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,345
playing with my dad

68
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,947
caused my downfall, clearly.

69
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,491
I probably should have 
voted against him.

70
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,100
But that's in the past.

71
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:14,404
I can use this 2nd chance 
to do what I wanted to do

72
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:15,589
and play better.

73
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,037
I really screwed up the first time.

74
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,897
I was scared at first.

75
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:28,435
Having discovered that I could 
socially navigate the game,

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,912
I decided to take action.

77
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,598
Eleventh person eliminated 
from Survivor: Blood vs. Water...

78
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:36,905
Alas, it had to start 
with the elimination of my mother.

79
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:38,330
I like you.

80
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,180
This time I want to be fearless.

81
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:44,192
I want to be from the start 
who I was at the end

82
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,319
and leave everything on the island.

83
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:51,301
The first time, 
I was "Tasha the nice one".

84
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:55,729
It's the least strategic game 
I've ever played.

85
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:57,392
It's really stupid.

86
00:04:57,517 --> 00:05:01,001
I didn't want to disappoint 
my family or the people of my church

87
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,802
by my way of playing.

88
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,781
When I returned 
to my church, they said:

89
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,486
"You need to be more aggressive,

90
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:09,676
lie and betray, 
like everyone else!"

91
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:11,878
So if the Saints 
think it's okay,

92
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,416
it's OK !

93
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,364
I'm here to make a million,

94
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,385
and when it's over, 
I'll pray for forgiveness.

95
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:29,142
This 2nd chance 
means more than anything to me.

96
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:32,156
In Australia, I jumped off a pole 
for peanut butter.

97
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:35,210
I gave up a million 
doing that.

98
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,913
- Peanut butter! 
- Anyone who gives up,

99
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,472
can join me.

100
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,114
Rehashing history, 
over and over again, for 14 years,

101
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,536
it reaches you.

102
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:47,180
Jeff, the tribe has spoken.

103
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:50,650
This is my chance 
to rewrite my own story.

104
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:53,788
I'm more mature, much smarter,

105
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:56,289
and I won't give up anything 
for peanut butter.

106
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,048
When I was little, with my father,

107
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,467
we were watching Survivor.

108
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:09,070
It was very hard

109
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:11,771
not being able to have him come 
for the visit of relatives.

110
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:14,483
I really wanted to do it,

111
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,152
prove to myself that I could go that 
far in the game.

112
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,221
Joe, the tribe has spoken.

113
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:20,814
Thanks, Jeff.

114
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,350
I failed, and it beat me down.

115
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:27,220
Now is the time for me 
to make it happen. Now.

116
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,071
We all have a little devil in us.

117
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,398
I was a bit of a troublemaker 
in my season.

118
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:39,766
Good luck !

119
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,781
Chaos Kass. She lives somewhere 
deep inside me.

120
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,540
But if I don't change

121
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:49,693
someone will have my skin.

122
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:52,055
I like the trace 
I have left so far.

123
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,280
I like chaos.

124
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:57,839
Only must change 
their perception of me.

125
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:01,963
And at the fusion, if I'm there, 
it will be the apocalypse.

126
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,936
When I think back to my season,

127
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,896
I made a lot of mistakes.

128
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,832
I created a lot of problems...

129
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:15,835
I'm your friend, but fuck me 
and you're dead.

130
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,038
It was a mistake.

131
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,599
I threw a coco 
on Skupin's head.

132
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,518
- Good God ! 
- Sorry.

133
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,911
It was a mistake.

134
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:26,955
I was too rough with Lisa.

135
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,472
You insult my intelligence.

136
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:32,504
Are you trying to deceive me? 
I am not stupid !

137
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:34,167
I should not have.

138
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:37,262
But I have a second chance to come back

139
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:39,668
and correct these small errors.

140
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,224
But I like to have fun. 
Bad guys have more fun.

141
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:53,181
Last time, with my wife, 
she occupied half of my thoughts.

142
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,360
You send your wife into exile. 
What do you feel ?

143
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:58,546
I do not know.

144
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,388
It was emotional, with Val.

145
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,629
I really like.

146
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:03,771
Knowing what she does 
is important to me.

147
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:05,427
I was not focused.

148
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,921
Eighth person eliminated 
and second member of the jury...

149
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:11,166
So I was taken by surprise 
by my own allies.

150
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,926
I came back, I cashed.

151
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,804
Now I want the money for Val 
more than for me.

152
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,084
I have to go through it all again.

153
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:20,367
I come looking for redemption.

154
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:40,796
Welcome to 
Survivor: Cambodia, Second Chance!

155
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,716
It's a unique season,

156
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:49,104
because you are all veterans

157
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,560
who have only played once 
and have not won.

158
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:55,270
In other words: you failed 
to achieve your goal.

159
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:59,311
And you have a 2nd chance 
to finish what you started.

160
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:02,851
To further fuel 
your motivation, you have been chosen,

161
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:07,581
elected by those who looked at you 
the first time,

162
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:08,981
our audience.

163
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,026
Ciera, what does it do?

164
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,727
We didn't choose you

165
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,419
the fans chose you.

166
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,498
It puts pressure.

167
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,767
You don't want to disappoint your family,

168
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,802
let alone America.

169
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,606
You could say 
that we would have forgotten you,

170
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,032
that was 14 years ago.

171
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:27,434
It has been a long time.

172
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,217
Have you often thought 
about doing this again?

173
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,305
Often. Very often.

174
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:37,513
I feel, or hear, 
the stage fright in your voice.

175
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:38,812
A little, yeah.

176
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:41,690
There is excitement, 
stage fright, emotion.

177
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,083
It's very strong.

178
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:46,689
Joe, you played 
in our most recent season.

179
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,565
It's almost like going home, 
taking a shower and leaving.

180
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,026
Yeah, the transition 
was pretty quick.

181
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,065
And here I am with the great players 
I watched growing up.

182
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,732
People who inspired my game.

183
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:03,052
Some of these great players... 
Terry, the beast of trials!

184
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:05,164
I was like, 
"I would love to do that!"

185
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,206
They paved the way for this game.

186
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,895
And we have to turn 
to Kelly Wiglesworth.

187
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,754
I'm here, Jeff!

188
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,222
The first finalist

189
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,957
of our very first season,

190
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,425
15 years ago.

191
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,195
It's weird to hear Joe say, 
"I grew up with..."

192
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,409
Hey, say!

193
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:22,948
We are old!

194
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,254
One vote, Wiglesworth.

195
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,768
One vote

196
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,723
allowed Richard Hatch 
to beat you.

197
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:31,812
Do you often think back 
to this final piece of advice?

198
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:34,100
Uh... Every day.

199
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:39,039
Good. 20 players

200
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,156
of 30 seasons.

201
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,276
All with one thing in common:

202
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,590
you waited for a 2nd chance.

203
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,515
She's there.

204
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,667
Let's go.

205
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:54,754
In your boats 
you will find a bag of bandanas

206
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,466
as well as a map 
to your respective beaches.

207
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,134
Two boats on the left.

208
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:03,972
Peih-Gee,

209
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,101
Vytas,

210
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,476
Deitz,

211
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,973
Your tribe is called Ta Keo.

212
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:14,294
Ta Keo!

213
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:16,051
Two boats on the right.

214
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,025
and Kimmi.

215
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,128
Your tribe is called Bayon.

216
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:29,525
The tribes are named 
after temples in Angkor Wat,

217
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,992
a site crossed while coming here.

218
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:35,203
Good. On this ship,

219
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:40,133
enough to make camp life 
much easier.

220
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,702
At my top, 
you'll get off the boat,

221
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,613
will come on this one

222
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,048
and gather 
all the material possible.

223
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,675
But there is a surprise.

224
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,930
100 meters behind this boat,

225
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:53,795
there is another boat.

226
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,426
Suspended on this boat: 
a large bag of rice.

227
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,387
The first person 
to collect the bag

228
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,022
earns it for his tribe.

229
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:03,890
The dilemma is therefore:

230
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,531
how long to 
spend on this boat

231
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:09,004
to gather the necessary 
for the camp,

232
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,941
and when to leave with the raft 
to try to have the rice?

233
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,401
Shit !

234
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,914
This is, in fact, 
your first test.

235
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,108
And it starts now.

236
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,791
Get on the boat, 
gather gear, quick!

237
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,118
Before another takes it all!

238
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,288
Nothing is easy in Survivor.

239
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:37,232
Spencer arrives first.

240
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:38,600
Here is Joe.

241
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,160
Come on, get moving!

242
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:41,394
Climb!

243
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,398
20 people trying 
to collect as many as possible!

244
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:47,901
15 years for some of you.

245
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:51,413
All this accumulated energy 
is finally released.

246
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:57,318
Here we are, your 2nd chance 
is now!

247
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,965
People up, people down!

248
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,556
Everyone collaborates!

249
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,094
Stephen, catch!

250
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:06,932
At some point, you will have to detach 
your raft and go towards the rice.

251
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:08,688
It's the sissy game!

252
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,492
There are pots 
and pans.

253
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,529
Watch your heads, 
it's flying everywhere!

254
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,232
Varner lowers 
a large load.

255
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,113
What has value, 
what does not?

256
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:25,213
That's right Jeremy, get that down!

257
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,233
We must go.

258
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:29,709
Ta Keo is on the go!

259
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,754
Bayon prepares to leave. 
It's the race for rice!

260
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:35,148
Once ready, 
release your raft!

261
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,517
You have a machete 
to cut the rope.

262
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,993
The Ta Keos are on their boat.

263
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,665
Varner frees her.

264
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,392
The Ta Keo are free.

265
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:48,295
The Bayons are on their boat. 
Joe cuts the rope.

266
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,764
Its good ! Come on, let's go!

267
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:53,742
It's rice racing now.

268
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,978
Which tribe will collaborate best

269
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,338
from the start of the game?

270
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:02,362
Fifteen years ago, 
Wiglesworth was a river guide.

271
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:05,645
Now 
she is swimming in front of the raft.

272
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:09,891
Ta Keo took the lead.

273
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:13,495
Bayon is in big trouble.

274
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,630
Their raft almost sinks.

275
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,824
- Can someone swim? 
- Yup.

276
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,893
Carry on. Bring me closer.

277
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,538
Wiglesworth is always 
faster than the raft.

278
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:24,764
She's done for.

279
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:25,892
Go on !

280
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,375
I go.

281
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,212
Good luck.

282
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:30,479
Yeah, Joe!

283
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:32,714
Joe is in the water for Bayon.

284
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:35,617
He springs into action 
and tries to catch up with Wiglesworth.

285
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,115
- Joe is coming, go! 
- Alright, I'm going.

286
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,928
We have a showdown!

287
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,958
Woo is in the water for Ta Keo.

288
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,160
- Come on, Joe! 
- Come on, Woo!

289
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:47,262
It overtakes Wiglesworth.

290
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,265
Joe tries to catch up to Woo.

291
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,261
Woo will be the first to the boat.

292
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:58,874
Woo has the rice for Ta Keo!

293
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:03,545
On the way to your beaches!

294
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,313
"Second chance", let's go!

295
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,029
39 days,

296
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:08,503
20 people,

297
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:10,273
a survivor !

298
00:16:43,673 --> 00:16:45,266
When I spotted the flag,

299
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:48,315
I wanted to cry, 
I was so excited!

300
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,926
Like when I got 
my first black belt.

301
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,111
A great honor.

302
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,722
- Great ! Good game ! 
- Glad to be here!

303
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:09,603
In this "2nd chance", 
I don't just play for myself,

304
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,364
I play for everyone 
who voted for me.

305
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,478
Nice to meet you.

306
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,580
We put the rice here, Vytas!

307
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,175
It might sadden Kimmi, 
but we can kill him.

308
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,877
Nice to meet you 
in the flesh!

309
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,880
Yes ! Neither brother nor father, 
everything is fine!

310
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,753
- A hug ? 
- And how !

311
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:32,751
- Mr. Jeff Varner! 
- I gave you a hug from afar.

312
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,196
It's a bit like...

313
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:37,565
the 1st day of Borneo was repeating itself.

314
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:41,097
So where do we start 
building?

315
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:42,695
My first thought was:

316
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,296
let's set up camp!

317
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,512
We use this sagging tree,

318
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,843
we put a beam up to the bag, there,

319
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:49,990
okay with you ?

320
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:52,524
We'll get some air over here.

321
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:01,856
For me it is important 
to work hard

322
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,395
and to be useful on the camp.

323
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,326
And we immediately saw

324
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,459
who were the workers.

325
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:09,997
me, wow...

326
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,571
Do we put the frame like this?

327
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:12,944
...and Vytas and Spencer.

328
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:14,672
- Not like that. 
- Oh, like that!

329
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:16,303
- This way. 
- Very well.

330
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,873
When people won't know 
where to sleep and it's raining,

331
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:23,255
I hope they remember 
I was there, building the shelter.

332
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:27,448
But we don't do more 
"old school Survivor" than I do!

333
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,079
Hey, since your brother 
was old school,

334
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:34,351
- I make you "old school" honorary! 
- Thanks !

335
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:36,424
I played a long time ago.

336
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,527
There is a huge difference 
between old school and new school.

337
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,264
You pass it over here, 
and you tie it under there.

338
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,701
Alright, that sounds good.

339
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:47,067
One of the differences today,

340
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,337
is that the game starts 
almost immediately,

341
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,833
as soon as we reach the beach.

342
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,233
Whereas in the old school 
it was more like:

343
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:56,227
"We need shelter and fire."

344
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,875
Let's put this here, so that 
the support is fixed.

345
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,450
My social game, 
for the past 9 years,

346
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,900
haunted me somewhat.

347
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,377
By building the shelter,

348
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,321
I heard my wife say to me:

349
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,833
"Don't let people 
walk away alone!

350
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,616
Make sure 
to participate in the social game!"

351
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:15,120
Because it's a big part 
of Survivor.

352
00:19:17,326 --> 00:19:19,325
- How do you feel ? 
- Excited to be here.

353
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,107
You will be the backbone!

354
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:24,177
You know how to make fire, 
that kind of stuff.

355
00:19:24,302 --> 00:19:26,659
Better than me, for sure. 
Better than most.

356
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:29,977
- We'll see. 
- The Beast of Trials!

357
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:34,675
I'm good as a team now. 
My son is a Survivor fanatic.

358
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,655
He made me a file 
on everyone.

359
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,195
He said, 
"Ally with Spencer!

360
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,078
He's a good guy, 
solid, loyal..."

361
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:44,322
Children of Terry,

362
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,801
Thank you for your father's trust in 
me!

363
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:49,822
Because I don't trust anyone. 
I will play according to my interests.

364
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:52,157
- I support you. 
- I know you're tough.

365
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:55,953
I want to play with 
strong, rational people.

366
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:58,177
It means a lot to me, 
really.

367
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:00,241
I'm a 
new school player,

368
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,376
but I'm a fan 
of all schools.

369
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,881
So it's important for me 
to have real relationships

370
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,973
and know what people think.

371
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:08,908
I will have more face-to-face

372
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,607
the first three days here, 
this time,

373
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:14,088
than during all Cagayan.

374
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:17,783
Have you seen my bag?

375
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:19,542
I can't find it anywhere.

376
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,996
I'm worried about my bag. 
He was there.

377
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,857
- Whose is this? 
- Not for me.

378
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:28,366
- Did you have anything in it? 
- Yes, my bracelet.

379
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,004
I'm worried,

380
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,776
because my bag has disappeared.

381
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:33,299
He can not be found.

382
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:35,531
Abi, do you want to take this bag?

383
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,267
- I want my bag. 
- Sure.

384
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:40,202
My bracelet is in it.

385
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,443
I have this leather bracelet,

386
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:45,786
with gold stuff, 
not real gold, but hey,

387
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,447
It's kind of my superpower bracelet .

388
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,648
It was hanging on this tree 
and it is nowhere to be found.

389
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,018
It's very strange.

390
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,454
Abi is obsessed with her bag.

391
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,232
She doesn't need anything in it 
except her bracelet.

392
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,575
Too weird.

393
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:04,572
The last time, in the Philippines, 
my emotions took over.

394
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,074
It contributed to my downfall.

395
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,812
I would like to check all the bags.

396
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:11,304
My bracelet is in it, 
and my bag can't be found.

397
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:13,621
- Did you look at the ones on the tree? 
- Yeah.

398
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:18,447
This time, I planned to control 
my emotions and my character.

399
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:21,589
It's part of the game 
I want to play now.

400
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,316
But it's so hard 
not to get your fangs out!

401
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,095
Take that, nail!

402
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,198
I have the rhythm!

403
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:41,256
- Is it okay, Kimmi? 
- Yeah !

404
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,011
Well done, my daughter!

405
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,137
It's hollow!

406
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,280
It's hollow!

407
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,774
The tribe seems 
in very good spirits.

408
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:51,794
Everyone works 
and gets along well.

409
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,680
One seems to have 
a very peaceful mantra.

410
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:59,450
I hope, by coming a second time, 
to be able to rewrite my story.

411
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,443
It comes back to you, Tash?

412
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:05,891
I can give 
my basic weaving class again.

413
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:08,903
We didn't have palm fronds, 
so I'm in training.

414
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,883
One of my three talents 
in life.

415
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,471
Isn't it crazy 
to be here again?

416
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:16,529
- Yeah, amazing. 
- I am so happy.

417
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,305
I love that.

418
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:23,739
We can't hang on to it, 
but it should hold.

419
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:25,477
I never imagined coming back,

420
00:22:25,602 --> 00:22:26,750
but here I am!

421
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,180
Glad to be there!

422
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,590
Let's build the frame.

423
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:33,786
The last time, I advanced 
cushy a good time.

424
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:35,173
Even without alliance,

425
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:37,318
I reached 4th place, 
it's not nothing.

426
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,834
But finishing 4th is hard to swallow.

427
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,062
I'm not going to change much, 
maybe make some adjustments.

428
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,772
We're just making the awning.

429
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:48,758
He doesn't need to go very far. 
It could be right there.

430
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:51,060
This 2nd time 
is going to be very different.

431
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:52,805
No fumbling this time!

432
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:56,945
It's a new season.

433
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,552
We forget everything.

434
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,159
It's from the past.

435
00:23:00,697 --> 00:23:04,931
It's season 31, 
and all is well between us.

436
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:06,452
I feel the tribe.

437
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:09,763
I knew, in my season, 
that I was seen as a threat.

438
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,417
So I thought, 
"Let's talk to Keith!"

439
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,534
All I hope 
is that if Keith hears my name,

440
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:16,929
he will come and tell me.

441
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:19,680
- In my head, we were OK. 
- For me too.

442
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:24,191
I'm trying to act strategically 
and think this season.

443
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:26,180
So I wanted Tasha,

444
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,334
probably the strongest woman here.

445
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:31,685
As long as it's not me... I 
'm fine.

446
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:33,796
And I wanted Savage.

447
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:36,916
Savage looks outspoken from the collar. 
Another physical threat.

448
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:39,739
I tell you, I support you.

449
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,829
We agree.

450
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,456
- What about Fish? 
- I do not feel it.

451
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:47,901
But above all, I wanted Joe.

452
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,595
No better shield than him.

453
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,334
A great group there.

454
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,868
Savage is in.

455
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:57,272
- I like it. 
- Cool.

456
00:23:57,397 --> 00:23:58,871
And it worked out well.

457
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:02,386
It would be silly to screw this up.

458
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,348
Everyone works.

459
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:06,954
I think we have the 
strongest group.

460
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,945
We can move forward in the game.

461
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,536
We could make some noise.

462
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:12,718
We have to stick together 
and support each other.

463
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:15,261
I must tell you. 
True story.

464
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:18,688
My daughters are going to kill me, but... 
They're 17 and 15.

465
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:20,578
We were watching your season.

466
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,048
I am sitting between my two daughters.

467
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:27,243
And my eldest, 
without really thinking about it, said:

468
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,767
"He is perfect."

469
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:31,725
And the younger one says:

470
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:37,777
I said, "Girls, I'm here!"

471
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:41,880
I learned last time 
that I was the most dangerous.

472
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:45,775
You have to act to make sure 
you progress in the game.

473
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,804
So either the dominant males 
kill each other,

474
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:51,123
or they team up 
and work together.

475
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:53,753
In the case of Jeremy and Savage,

476
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:56,228
I think we all agree

477
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:57,564
to help each other.

478
00:24:57,814 --> 00:25:01,233
Hey, guys! 
You are serious!

479
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,925
Come on Andrew!

480
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:20,394
Andrew, you're a crack!

481
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:24,703
- He felled that tree! 
- He just killed him.

482
00:25:24,828 --> 00:25:26,725
It falls ! 
And that's it for the tree!

483
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:31,539
Guys really impress me. 
Seriously, that changes everything.

484
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:35,543
I feel like the last time: 
out of place in my tribe,

485
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,278
with guys different from me.

486
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:39,713
Fishbach, a fish out of water, 
once again!

487
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:58,471
The history of Tocantins 
could repeat itself.

488
00:25:58,596 --> 00:25:59,934
I was lost,

489
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,347
and I bonded with someone 
who was in his element.

490
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:05,331
And we went all the way.

491
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:08,091
JT was too awesome, 
he tore me down in the end.

492
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:10,069
I won't make the same mistake.

493
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:13,194
I wish I was... 
more in my element here.

494
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,179
With construction and everything.

495
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:19,125
What can I do but sit 
down and clap?

496
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,147
All these big badass in my tribe, 
it's my nightmare!

497
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:23,909
- Are you good at weaving? 
- Nope.

498
00:26:25,114 --> 00:26:27,828
Either I will have total control 
of my tribe...

499
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,222
It makes no sense !

500
00:26:29,347 --> 00:26:32,791
...or I will make crates of them 
and quickly explode in flight.

501
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,039
I need water. 
I am dizzy.

502
00:26:54,164 --> 00:26:56,321
- It's hot. 
- Let's take a break.

503
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:58,508
Go quietly. 
There is a lot of excitement.

504
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,958
- I say. A lot. 
- The adrenaline. It climbs and...

505
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,487
We're all knackered, yeah.

506
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:05,747
When I first played, 
I ended up in a female tribe.

507
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:07,691
And they wanted my skin.

508
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:09,468
I had the chance

509
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:11,228
to get into their good graces.

510
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:14,281
- Glad we're together. 
- Yeah me too.

511
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:16,533
Some say, 
"He manipulated those women!"

512
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:19,936
But no. I just manipulated 
some of their views.

513
00:27:20,061 --> 00:27:23,106
This is the heart of Survivor. 
And I'm good at it.

514
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:25,175
- Where do you come from ? 
- Hong Kong.

515
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,344
I have a very good friend 
who looks like you.

516
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:30,313
Chinese, freckles, 
she's very beautiful.

517
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:33,221
- Thanks. 
- Very beautiful.

518
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:36,113
But I don't want to 
come across as a manipulator.

519
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,088
Because it is dangerous, 
especially at the beginning.

520
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:41,315
- We never spoke. 
- I say ! It's nice to be here!

521
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,295
- In old Blood vs. Water! 
- In old Blood vs. Water!

522
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,501
I say !

523
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:49,377
I want women to think, 
"He's nice, he's helpful,

524
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,137
he's great, 
I want to get to know him better."

525
00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:53,822
Do not stress !

526
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:55,184
Vytas ...

527
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:01,520
I see Vytas as a bootlicker.

528
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:05,048
I saw it that way in its 1st season, 
and it's the same now.

529
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:08,478
Go ahead, Woo, drive that nail in!

530
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,831
From the outset, I wanted to embark 
the people who interest me

531
00:28:12,956 --> 00:28:15,700
and lock the thing, 
from the start.

532
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,761
Because having a second chance 
is a rare opportunity,

533
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:21,542
especially in this game.

534
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,275
I'm not going to spoil it.

535
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,195
Vytas has plenty of connections.

536
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,379
I don't know 
if you noticed it,

537
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:30,663
but Vytas is related to Terry through Aras, 
Aras and Terry having played together.

538
00:28:30,788 --> 00:28:33,528
- It's just. 
- And Aras and Terry are super close.

539
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:35,720
So Vytas and Terry too.

540
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:37,681
They will probably hide from it.

541
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:40,991
Vytas has way too many links, 
overall, in the game.

542
00:28:41,116 --> 00:28:44,596
And he also has obvious connections 
with the other tribe.

543
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,727
Ciera and Vytas performed together. 
They are super close.

544
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,076
You are very observant. 
I don't see any of that.

545
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:52,354
- I have to get in the bath. 
- Everything is fine !

546
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,600
- It's been a while. 
- You have to restart the machine.

547
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:56,366
Shirin has an impressive speed.

548
00:28:56,491 --> 00:28:59,610
This train is on, 
and I'm glad to be on board.

549
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:02,616
I am on board. It doesn't matter 
who takes me to the woods,

550
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,583
I answer "yes".

551
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,052
- I don't know Kelley. 
- Peih-Gee...

552
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:09,589
- Kelley... 
- I don't know her, but I love her.

553
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,468
So let's hire her.

554
00:29:11,593 --> 00:29:14,030
Good grief, grandma, calm down!

555
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:15,937
I just arrived!

556
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:18,649
The driver decides 
the speed of the train,

557
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:21,619
and she's on her toes... 
What's bugging my ass?!

558
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:24,926
- And Peih-Gee? 
- We'll see later.

559
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:27,243
- I do not know her. 
- Let's get some water.

560
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:30,609
Peih-Gee... We'll see that by feeling.

561
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,717
My first time, in Australia, 
it was all for the adventure.

562
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:37,082
There was no strategy.

563
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:40,485
I haven't played for 15 years. 
Do we do this now?

564
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,173
I'm not in my element.

565
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:45,093
I don't know what to do 
or where to turn.

566
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:49,301
I don't know 
if it's to have waited 15 years,

567
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,488
but it's the right time for me.

568
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:54,465
I will be 50 next year. 
It's quite a milestone.

569
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,651
Most men 
go through a crisis at this age.

570
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:59,829
They buy a Corvette, 
cheat on their wives.

571
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:01,633
I go to Survivor.

572
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,881
It's not a crisis, 
it's a quest.

573
00:30:05,356 --> 00:30:09,347
The 2nd half of my life begins 
with Survivor Second Chance.

574
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,416
I feel so weird, 
it's like...

575
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:15,245
I'm the old one, but I feel 
like a newborn.

576
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,520
- Okay, where's my bracelet? 
- In one of the hanging bags.

577
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:27,848
No, I looked everywhere.

578
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:29,986
She has my bag!

579
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:33,625
- You found it ! 
- Is that Peih-Gee's bag?

580
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,064
- My bracelet! 
- Is that Peih-Gee's bag?

581
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:37,964
It has his name on it.

582
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,302
I do not know what to think.

583
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:44,931
But I found my bracelet.

584
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:47,811
It was a bag 
with a label: "Peih-Gee".

585
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:50,547
I stick my hand to it,

586
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:55,193
and the first thing I get out of 
it is my damn bracelet.

587
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:57,017
It's very interesting, isn't it?

588
00:30:57,142 --> 00:30:58,513
Are you going to say something?

589
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:00,727
No. But now I know.

590
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:05,137
I found my bracelet 
in Peih-Gee's bag.

591
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:08,871
- I found my bracelet... 
- Really?

592
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:11,176
- ...in Peih-Gee's bag. 
- Not possible !

593
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:13,948
- Promised sworn. 
- Did she take it by accident?

594
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:17,318
I don't want to say anything, 
I give him the benefit of the doubt.

595
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:20,552
She has no reason 
to steal my bracelet.

596
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,021
But in my head, I say to myself:

597
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:26,449
"Maybe she was trying 
to wake up the Brazilian dragon."

598
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:29,277
You know what ? Let her stuff 
that damn bag into [beep]!

599
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:33,646
But even if sometimes, deep inside me, 
I want to scream,

600
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:36,368
to let my character 
take over,

601
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,109
I can't afford it.

602
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:40,196
This is my second chance, 
I have to play it smart.

603
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:44,105
It's very strange, because... 
I've talked about it a lot, haven't I?

604
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:46,736
- In effect. 
- Abundantly.

605
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:51,441
Abi-Maria generated weirdness

606
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:54,352
around this bracelet which, 
according to her, I had taken.

607
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:56,612
I wanted to settle it with her,

608
00:31:56,737 --> 00:31:59,357
so she won't think 
I stole that bracelet from her.

609
00:31:59,763 --> 00:32:02,087
They tell me your bracelet 
was in my bag.

610
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,853
Yeah, it was in your bag.

611
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:05,626
Do you know what happened?

612
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:08,927
- There was a bag without a label. 
- Yeah, that was mine.

613
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,445
And I didn't realize, 
I thought it was empty,

614
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,572
so I took it and...

615
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:15,749
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

616
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:18,906
I wanted you to know, 
I know you've been looking for it.

617
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:21,913
Yes, I looked for it for quite a while.

618
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:24,967
During my last participation,

619
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:27,465
I didn't create 
the relationships I should have.

620
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,678
I have learned :

621
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:31,815
make friends, but keep 
your enemies even closer.

622
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,889
So, no hard feelings? 
Don't go thinking...

623
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,988
Like I said, 
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

624
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:54,112
Look, 
they're trying to make a fire!

625
00:32:57,204 --> 00:32:58,808
It's a big part of the game.

626
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,552
Even the most important.

627
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:02,087
Fire, water, shelter.

628
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:03,466
We feel it!

629
00:33:04,073 --> 00:33:05,123
It's coming !

630
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:08,093
It didn't work out in my season, 
so I don't know,

631
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:11,276
but to concentrate the light, 
we can take a leaf

632
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:13,018
and make a pinhole,

633
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:15,468
- it focuses... 
- Or a drop of water.

634
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,038
This second chance

635
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,896
it sets the tone for everyone, 
"this time that's it".

636
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:23,158
I was afraid of not being chosen, 
having betrayed someone.

637
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:26,527
But people surely know 
that I'm going to play, that it's going to blow up.

638
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:28,935
A lot of people are there 
to prove something.

639
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,208
I'm just here to win. 
No matter how.

640
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,734
Where did Stephen go?

641
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:34,988
I do not know.

642
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,783
I believe he is "looking for an idol".

643
00:33:36,908 --> 00:33:37,914
Oh really ?

644
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:48,399
Gone to look for wood,

645
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:50,902
I couldn't help 
looking for an idol.

646
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,630
Because if I can't find it, 
someone else will.

647
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:57,090
But this beach is huge, 
there are lots of trees.

648
00:33:57,215 --> 00:34:01,108
I went to this disgusting swamp, 
it was very filthy.

649
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:05,675
I can't imagine Jeff Probst 
hiding an idol in this swamp.

650
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,886
But the game is on.

651
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:10,084
It's a perfect place 
for an idol.

652
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:13,374
A crazy pond 
in the middle of nowhere.

653
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:15,051
I need the idol,

654
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:17,951
or create a strong bond 
with someone

655
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:19,222
who hopefully

656
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:23,268
won't hold it against me 
for being a binocular.

657
00:34:24,756 --> 00:34:27,305
I'm sure my trick 
has been noticed.

658
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,667
I hope it won't 
mark me. Probably, yes.

659
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:32,698
"Fishbach is looking for the idol!"

660
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,005
Zut !

661
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,078
You are there, my brother.

662
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,792
- You and it is! 
- You and it is!

663
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,226
How beautiful it is.

664
00:34:52,421 --> 00:34:53,520
We have fire!

665
00:34:57,941 --> 00:34:59,938
It's teamwork!

666
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,707
Teamwork is magic!

667
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,445
- Great ! 
- It's not great ?

668
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,734
- This is what to do! 
- Well done, Joe!

669
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,850
I remain amazed

670
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:14,286
that Joe made a fire.

671
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:16,321
And starting from scratch!

672
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,985
And I prayed above!

673
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:22,360
- It's thanks to you ! 
- Did I pray or what?

674
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:23,858
Joe was amazing.

675
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,980
In this environment, 
with this humidity,

676
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:29,134
We found Mother Nature 
on the 1st day by making a fire.

677
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:31,103
And that, in my opinion,

678
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:33,863
this is a very good sign for the future.

679
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:35,577
Cheers to Survivor!

680
00:36:13,611 --> 00:36:14,822
I feel dirty.

681
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:16,740
- That's the game ! 
- After just one day.

682
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:18,575
After just one day.

683
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,161
Everything turns.

684
00:36:20,286 --> 00:36:22,947
2nd day, and it's like 
I've never played.

685
00:36:23,072 --> 00:36:24,080
It's hard.

686
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:26,947
It's hot. 
I want to cool off.

687
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,557
This game is way too fast. 
I can't follow.

688
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:32,547
But I play hard.

689
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:35,834
I try not to show it, 
but I play hard.

690
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:38,064
Who do you see regrouping, so far?

691
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:40,457
Make sure we agree.

692
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:43,647
- The ones from the shelter, I think. 
- The ones from the shelter?

693
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:45,870
- Yeah. 
- Against those on the beach.

694
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,151
- We are in those of the beach? 
- I do not know.

695
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:50,157
'Cause I did both, 
you know?

696
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:52,673
I walked on the beach 
and worked on the shelter.

697
00:36:52,798 --> 00:36:55,090
There are two divisions 
on this beach.

698
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,514
Those who built the shelter, 
the old school.

699
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:00,550
The old school 
wants to do it the old way.

700
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:02,961
You work, and that's your value.

701
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:05,538
The new school 
just wanna hit the beach

702
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,905
and recruit me into an alliance.

703
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,736
But I don't want to betray 
those in the shelter, my people.

704
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:15,055
- I'm in a funny situation. 
- Me too.

705
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,743
I believe we are in the same place.

706
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,179
If you had to pick someone 
to go first...

707
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,281
I believe Shirin 
wants to eliminate Vytas.

708
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,217
We should aim for someone like Abi.

709
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,653
It's my 2nd chance, 
and I'm in the unknown,

710
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:30,046
I am lost.

711
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:32,324
Old school, new school, 
what to do?

712
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:48,641
- Hello ! 
- Hello !

713
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,386
Hello Sunshine !

714
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,357
We need water.

715
00:37:52,797 --> 00:37:56,816
I have to consider how 
I played last time.

716
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,438
I didn't take 
enough risks.

717
00:37:59,563 --> 00:38:01,587
We don't always get a second chance.

718
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,027
I'm not going to spoil it.

719
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:05,558
And in general, the immunity idol

720
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,579
is already in the camp when we arrive.

721
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,155
So I expect, 
in a "second chance" season,

722
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,452
there must be one.

723
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:17,267
All those palm fronds! 
It hard bump.

724
00:38:17,392 --> 00:38:19,851
I chose to go for 
leaves and coconuts.

725
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:23,264
I knew it would give me 
the opportunity to look for the idol.

726
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:26,209
Let's put some stuff in the way, 
and if somebody comes,

727
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:28,978
I'll say, "I put that there 
for you to bring back."

728
00:38:29,103 --> 00:38:30,107
Yeah !

729
00:38:30,232 --> 00:38:31,902
Sneaky, sneaky!

730
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:36,468
Where is the idol?

731
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,104
Damn it.

732
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,371
Everything looks the same here!

733
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,015
Little idol, where can you be?

734
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,968
Where can you be?

735
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:52,233
yuck. Not in there.

736
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:57,140
I searched for quite a while.

737
00:38:57,265 --> 00:39:00,280
And then 
I pass a tree...

738
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:06,248
Oh, brothel!

739
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:09,863
Brothel!

740
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:12,325
Not possible. Oh my God !

741
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,081
It's incredible.

742
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:21,234
I think I just 
found the immunity idol.

743
00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:24,998
Oh my God ! Yes !

744
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:27,006
It is enormous ! Oh my God !

745
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:29,742
I hope... What is it?

746
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:33,206
"Congratulations! You have found 
the clue leading to the Immunity Idol."

747
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:35,219
Alright, I got a little carried away.

748
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:37,216
"What you seek 
is within your reach,

749
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,005
but will require audacity.

750
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,045
At the end of the immunity test,

751
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,924
you will place your raft 
on a support with four tripods.

752
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:48,338
Hidden under the right front tripod 
is the idol.

753
00:39:48,463 --> 00:39:51,260
But are you fearless enough 
to take her in full ordeal,

754
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:53,566
in front of your unsuspecting comrades 
?

755
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,566
If so, immunity is yours."

756
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,730
Usually 
the idol is somewhere on the camp.

757
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,340
That she's on trial is crazy,

758
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,685
because everyone can see you 
if you are not discreet enough.

759
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,076
It's incredible.

760
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:09,012
If, on trial, 
I think I can do it...

761
00:40:09,137 --> 00:40:10,381
I am so happy !

762
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:12,977
...I'll try to take it. 
Otherwise, it will be super blatant.

763
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:28,659
Bayon, it's time!

764
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:30,048
Go on !

765
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,239
It's time to go. 
This is our official flag.

766
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:34,731
He tears up !

767
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:39,345
"15 years waiting to come back...

768
00:40:39,595 --> 00:40:41,714
The first race ever!

769
00:40:42,288 --> 00:40:45,318
Then a first player is eliminated...

770
00:40:46,168 --> 00:40:48,654
And then we're not kidding."

771
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:51,023
The first event ever contested?

772
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,550
Our first test

773
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:55,928
will be the very first test

774
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:58,334
of the very first Survivor.

775
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:02,201
And to have had the first mail 
after having waited so long,

776
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:04,270
I was a bit nervous.

777
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,863
It's Survivor, 
but this is a family.

778
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:08,866
We are ten, strong and in tune.

779
00:41:08,991 --> 00:41:10,710
And in this ordeal,

780
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,812
everyone here will be on their toes.

781
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,818
And we support each other.

782
00:41:14,943 --> 00:41:16,716
Mail makes me nervous.

783
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,463
Everyone knows I'm 
one of the smallest here.

784
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:22,725
The first time, 
I was trying to minimize it,

785
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,851
not to make 
a big deal out of it.

786
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:27,765
Now 
I just want to do my part.

787
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,554
I think I'm stronger.

788
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,662
Then we come back down and let go,

789
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,328
we take it all out.

790
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:41,285
All the negative.

791
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:44,310
Joe does yoga!

792
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,678
I don't do yoga.

793
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,047
In the morning, I get up, have 
a coffee and go to work.

794
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,249
Like 99% of Americans.

795
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:53,611
Nobody wants to see me lean 
forward, [???] and all that.

796
00:41:53,736 --> 00:41:57,034
Joe is a free spirit, 
long hair, great.

797
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,468
He's great on the camp.

798
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:00,451
He brings things back, 
cuts things up.

799
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:03,187
But yoga... It's Joe.

800
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,019
...finishing to inhale.

801
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:07,325
Today we did...

802
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,530
Not yoga, "joega".

803
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:12,004
And frankly,

804
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,963
I was a little distracted.

805
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:17,101
I was trying to breathe, 
but I was only thinking of one thing:

806
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:18,745
Joe's body.

807
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:21,630
How to concentrate? 
Look at the !

808
00:42:21,755 --> 00:42:25,718
But we have a good state of mind 
to win this event.

809
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,343
I'm excited. 
We are pumped up.

810
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:35,729
Put your feet back. So.

811
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,088
Pull your butt back.

812
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:39,841
Flat heels. Lower the torso.

813
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:41,525
Here it is, like this.

814
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,855
It is a modified version 
of the dog pose.

815
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,521
Feel the tension in the chest.

816
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:49,032
Before the test,

817
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,769
Vytas showed me 
some yoga positions.

818
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:53,279
Reminds you :

819
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,364
- against the tree, like this... 
- I'll try to remember.

820
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:59,210
- Against the boat, like that... 
- You'll give me a little quiz.

821
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:02,529
And that's good 
if you're feeling hunched over.

822
00:43:02,654 --> 00:43:05,291
He does too much sometimes!

823
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,262
He's so yoga, and...

824
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:10,805
Chrinavasana, monkey position,

825
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,623
vanamasala mala.

826
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:15,968
You lift your chest.

827
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:20,336
You arch your back, you release 
the armpits, and the collarbone.

828
00:43:20,748 --> 00:43:22,708
Vytas plays the fool,

829
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:25,437
he tries to flirt, and it annoys me.

830
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,847
It's absolutely not sexy.

831
00:43:28,097 --> 00:43:30,850
Go away ! Like an insect. 
Oust!

832
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,286
So I want Vytas out.

833
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,221
He died for me. He annoys me.

834
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,608
You can even do it 
against cover, for example.

835
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,675
The thing is...

836
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:45,037
- She looks at your idol! 
- I don't want to see his idol.

837
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:49,017
- Abi wants yoga? 
- Nope.

838
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:51,912
- How do you feel ? Your body ? 
- Great.

839
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:57,443
Abi is not easy to deal with.

840
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,228
People annoy him very quickly.

841
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:01,339
She sent me 
negative vibes this morning.

842
00:44:01,586 --> 00:44:04,717
I wouldn't be surprised 
if she whispered "let's turn Vytas".

843
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,220
I have to make sure 
she doesn't get too comfortable.

844
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:08,539
Because the first time

845
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:10,982
I lacked lucidity, 
I was too confident.

846
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,694
A) we want to win the competitions.

847
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:16,456
But B), if we don't win, 
we need Spencer on our side.

848
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:19,087
I was thinking of firing Abi 
from the start.

849
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:22,894
Fire Abi is smart, 
because we can rally everyone.

850
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:24,854
Because no one likes it.

851
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:27,031
But the day 
has only just begun.

852
00:44:27,156 --> 00:44:29,521
Someone might do 
something really stupid later,

853
00:44:29,646 --> 00:44:31,065
pass the test.

854
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:33,515
But if the tide turns against Abi,

855
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,740
I will just have to let it go.

856
00:45:01,663 --> 00:45:03,164
Over here, everyone!

857
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,651
First immunity test.

858
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:14,208
I had only one obsession: 
the immunity idol.

859
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:15,677
I only had that in mind.

860
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:23,760
- Ready for today's challenge? 
- Oh yeah !

861
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:26,020
I love this enthusiasm!

862
00:45:27,222 --> 00:45:28,423
Today,

863
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:30,839
the two tribes will swim 
to a raft,

864
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:33,089
where you will light a torch.

865
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:35,863
You will use 
it to light a series of fires

866
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:40,134
up to a support 
where you will place your raft.

867
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:45,303
Then one person per tribe

868
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:48,138
will make a long pole 
out of sticks and string.

869
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:50,933
With this pole, 
you will recover a key.

870
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:55,111
The 1st tribe to open their portal 
and light the last fire...

871
00:45:58,691 --> 00:45:59,821
gain immunity.

872
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:02,094
Unvoted.

873
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,993
You all know 
that's what you want in this game.

874
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:07,470
It's security

875
00:46:07,595 --> 00:46:09,931
and certainty. 
Without, you risk trouble.

876
00:46:10,254 --> 00:46:11,266
Furthermore,

877
00:46:11,806 --> 00:46:14,106
you also play 
for a reward.

878
00:46:17,489 --> 00:46:19,951
A huge Survivor-style fire kit.

879
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:21,084
Flint,

880
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:22,510
kerosene, matches,

881
00:46:22,635 --> 00:46:24,412
a tarp for your wood.

882
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:26,427
Something to make your life easier.

883
00:46:26,552 --> 00:46:27,582
Losers:

884
00:46:27,707 --> 00:46:30,818
council, where someone 
will be the first person

885
00:46:30,943 --> 00:46:33,697
eliminated from Survivor Second Chance.

886
00:46:34,122 --> 00:46:36,991
This trial is very special 
in the history of Survivor.

887
00:46:37,323 --> 00:46:40,442
"The Quest for Fire" was 
the very first test

888
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:41,845
from the very first episode.

889
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,165
Kelly Wiglesworth was there. 
She lost.

890
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:46,609
Thanks for reminding me, Jeff!

891
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:49,711
It is therefore a second chance 
with very high stakes.

892
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:52,840
One minute to organize yourself 
and here we go.

893
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:03,323
Let's go.

894
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:06,015
Immunity and fire are at stake.

895
00:47:06,554 --> 00:47:07,689
Survivors, ready?

896
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:18,808
Here we are, your first test 
for a second chance!

897
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:23,611
The raft can only move forward 
when everyone is there.

898
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,707
Tasha arrives last.

899
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:27,041
Come on, forward!

900
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,643
Ta Keo part in premier.

901
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:30,738
Bayon is just behind.

902
00:47:31,379 --> 00:47:33,096
We must collaborate

903
00:47:33,514 --> 00:47:35,191
to move this raft.

904
00:47:35,316 --> 00:47:37,293
You have to communicate well.

905
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:39,254
Keith holds the torch for Bayon.

906
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:41,694
Spencer is going to take 
the torch for Ta Keo.

907
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:42,857
Quick !

908
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:48,787
Spencer lights 
the first fire for Ta Keo.

909
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:52,042
Keith lights the 1st fire for Bayon. 
It's neck and neck.

910
00:47:55,628 --> 00:47:57,747
Spencer lights the second fire.

911
00:47:58,766 --> 00:48:01,484
Keith lights the second fire 
for his tribe.

912
00:48:02,078 --> 00:48:03,545
Keith lost his fire.

913
00:48:04,554 --> 00:48:06,756
- Light it up, Keith! 
- We have to turn it back on, Keith!

914
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:08,554
- Light it up, Keith! 
- Light it up!

915
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,127
- Keith is wasting precious time. 
- Come on, Keith!

916
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:12,799
Spencer, for Ta Keo,

917
00:48:14,116 --> 00:48:15,889
lights its third fire.

918
00:48:16,014 --> 00:48:17,233
Come on, Keith!

919
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:19,920
- Keith struggles to rekindle the fire. 
- Don't drop the torch!

920
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:22,616
Keith attempts to light 
the third fire for Bayon.

921
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,165
Its good !

922
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,110
Spencer lit 
Ta Keo's fourth fire.

923
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:29,412
Bayon is now slowing down.

924
00:48:29,816 --> 00:48:31,648
Ta Keo widens the gap.

925
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,682
Spencer lit the 5th fire of Ta Keo.

926
00:48:34,807 --> 00:48:35,944
Get out of the water!

927
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:38,348
Keith reaches out for Bayon.

928
00:48:39,147 --> 00:48:40,290
Its good !

929
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:45,820
The Ta Keo are in the lead.

930
00:48:46,236 --> 00:48:48,053
They continue to light the fires.

931
00:48:48,748 --> 00:48:51,021
Keith still struggles with fire.

932
00:48:51,146 --> 00:48:52,926
He is wasting time.

933
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,317
Keith lit 
Bayon's fifth fire.

934
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,201
The Ta Keo 
lit all their fires.

935
00:49:00,326 --> 00:49:03,104
You must now place 
your raft on the support.

936
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:21,998
Kelly Wiglesworth gets down to business.

937
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:23,600
Come on, Kelly, you're going to rock!

938
00:49:23,725 --> 00:49:25,560
Sticks and string 
to create a pole

939
00:49:25,685 --> 00:49:27,762
long enough to retrieve the key.

940
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:31,007
I look back 
and say, "Damn!

941
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,134
I missed an opportunity 
to take an idol."

942
00:49:33,259 --> 00:49:36,179
I really want the idol, 
but without being seen.

943
00:49:36,304 --> 00:49:37,839
Otherwise, I could be targeted.

944
00:49:43,011 --> 00:49:45,500
The Bayons finally arrive. 
Who will do it?

945
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,923
It will be Joe,

946
00:49:47,348 --> 00:49:49,592
- at work for Bayon. 
- Come on Joe!

947
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:51,541
Kelly pour Ta Keo.

948
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,130
- That's good, Kelly! 
- Joe, she's finished.

949
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,682
You have to get there on the 1st try.

950
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:59,951
The pole must be 
long enough and strong enough

951
00:50:00,076 --> 00:50:01,996
- to retrieve the key. 
- One again !

952
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:03,893
Keep going, you're leading wide!

953
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:06,060
It's easier said than done.

954
00:50:06,185 --> 00:50:08,211
The key is far away.

955
00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:11,914
- It's great, you sure! 
- She has finished.

956
00:50:12,373 --> 00:50:13,391
Gently !

957
00:50:13,516 --> 00:50:15,910
Kelly will give it a shot, 
see if it's long enough.

958
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:18,646
- Hold it straight. 
- Very straight.

959
00:50:20,209 --> 00:50:21,983
- Go ahead, Joe! 
- It won't last.

960
00:50:22,665 --> 00:50:23,952
Not long enough, Kel!

961
00:50:24,077 --> 00:50:26,429
It's way too short for Kelly.

962
00:50:26,554 --> 00:50:28,696
She will have to add sticks.

963
00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:31,422
You can do it, Joe!

964
00:50:31,547 --> 00:50:33,770
- No more sticks! 
- Quick !

965
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,471
- Go! Go! Go ! 
- You rule !

966
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,001
- Take your time ! 
- Joe's gonna give it a shot.

967
00:50:40,126 --> 00:50:43,680
Is his pole 
long enough and strong enough?

968
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,340
It seems quite long.

969
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:47,429
Is it strong enough?

970
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:49,644
A big immunity at stake.

971
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:51,721
Nobody wants to leave.

972
00:50:54,876 --> 00:50:56,312
Can it get there?

973
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:01,778
Joe tries to reach this key, 
he turns around.

974
00:51:01,903 --> 00:51:04,681
Is his pole strong enough 
to unhook it?

975
00:51:09,225 --> 00:51:12,093
Wiglesworth now launches. 
Can she get there?

976
00:51:15,777 --> 00:51:17,046
Joe is on the key,

977
00:51:17,171 --> 00:51:18,773
he tries to lift her.

978
00:51:18,898 --> 00:51:20,150
Get up, get up!

979
00:51:24,243 --> 00:51:26,293
Wiglesworth is on the key.

980
00:51:27,874 --> 00:51:28,992
Joe has the key.

981
00:51:34,289 --> 00:51:35,823
Wiglesworth fails.

982
00:51:35,948 --> 00:51:38,034
Joe slowly moves the key.

983
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:39,661
Don't drop her!

984
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:42,230
That works ! Joe has the key!

985
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,007
Fonce, you go-y !

986
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:45,733
Can he bring her back? Yes !

987
00:51:45,858 --> 00:51:48,648
Spencer gets in there and tries 
to come back up for the Ta Keo.

988
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,104
He will only have one try.

989
00:51:50,547 --> 00:51:52,494
The Bayons are on the padlock

990
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:54,790
while Spencer 
tries to reach for the key.

991
00:51:54,915 --> 00:51:56,010
Can he do it ?

992
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,657
He's on it.

993
00:52:01,783 --> 00:52:03,017
Nope ! Too short !

994
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:05,168
The Bayon come through the portal!

995
00:52:05,293 --> 00:52:07,230
There is only one fire left to light!

996
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,032
For victory

997
00:52:09,157 --> 00:52:11,805
and the 1st trial 
of Survivor Second Chance.

998
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,078
Bayon wins immunity!

999
00:52:15,394 --> 00:52:17,841
They send Ta Keo to the council.

1000
00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:23,498
Unbelievable !

1001
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:26,616
I screwed up.

1002
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:33,189
Bayonne, congratulations.

1003
00:52:33,883 --> 00:52:35,125
First test.

1004
00:52:35,641 --> 00:52:38,316
No Bayon member 
will be leaving tonight.

1005
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:40,922
Take your reward,

1006
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:42,906
return to camp, 
enjoy the evening.

1007
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:44,238
Thanks, Jeff!

1008
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:53,935
15 years later,

1009
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:56,296
- same result. 
- Same result.

1010
00:52:56,421 --> 00:52:58,306
Do you feel 
a bit responsible?

1011
00:52:58,431 --> 00:53:00,375
Absolutely. 
100% responsible.

1012
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,057
We had a good lead, 
and that's where we lost it.

1013
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,148
It's my fault, I take it.

1014
00:53:06,273 --> 00:53:08,541
- Seriously, it's fine. 
- You are moved.

1015
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:12,153
Is it because 
you don't like to disappoint?

1016
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:15,432
- She didn't disappoint us. 
- She's great.

1017
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:16,956
Do not worry.

1018
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:21,299
Ta Keo, I have nothing for you 
except a date with me at the council.

1019
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,264
And we're off to the board...

1020
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:25,633
immediately.

1021
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:31,881
We don't have a second 
to discuss

1022
00:53:32,006 --> 00:53:34,175
game, strategy. Nothing.

1023
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,978
It makes me nervous to death

1024
00:53:36,103 --> 00:53:38,888
to go to the council 
without having been able to organize themselves.

1025
00:53:39,013 --> 00:53:40,915
We have a tribe with Abi-Maria,

1026
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,940
Jeff Varner 
and all the service freaks.

1027
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:45,923
If the worst comes true,

1028
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:49,799
it could be cataclysmic.

1029
00:54:30,363 --> 00:54:31,890
Behind you, torches.

1030
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:34,622
Grab one 
and light it in the fire.

1031
00:54:41,107 --> 00:54:43,198
It is part 
of the council ritual,

1032
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:46,212
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

1033
00:54:46,337 --> 00:54:47,822
If your fire disappears,

1034
00:54:47,947 --> 00:54:49,167
you too.

1035
00:54:50,426 --> 00:54:51,793
So, Spencer.

1036
00:54:51,918 --> 00:54:54,372
What does this 2nd chance mean, 
now that you're here,

1037
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:57,526
chosen by those 
who watched you play?

1038
00:54:58,783 --> 00:55:02,537
It's even more heartbreaking 
when you think about it.

1039
00:55:02,662 --> 00:55:04,096
If you leave tonight,

1040
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:06,786
you disappoint yourself, 
your friends, your family,

1041
00:55:06,911 --> 00:55:10,385
and as a bonus, all those who wanted 
you to have this 2nd chance.

1042
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,935
Woo, what did you notice 
in the first few moments?

1043
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,173
Because sometimes

1044
00:55:14,298 --> 00:55:17,079
from the outset, people plot, 
talk, combine...

1045
00:55:17,204 --> 00:55:18,211
Absolutely.

1046
00:55:18,336 --> 00:55:21,314
Immediately, 
a great division was created.

1047
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:24,483
There's the old school: 
"Hey, let's build the shelter!",

1048
00:55:24,608 --> 00:55:26,007
and then the new school:

1049
00:55:26,132 --> 00:55:28,120
"Let's strategize, 
let's talk!"

1050
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:29,897
And it was very clear.

1051
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:32,400
- Deitz, okay with that? 
- Yes.

1052
00:55:32,525 --> 00:55:33,993
I'm old school.

1053
00:55:34,118 --> 00:55:36,237
We were busy building,

1054
00:55:36,362 --> 00:55:38,940
without much opportunity to speak. 
Then, a little later,

1055
00:55:39,065 --> 00:55:41,400
we sat down with a few 
and started talking.

1056
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:43,069
It's a big part of the game.

1057
00:55:43,362 --> 00:55:45,171
It's a huge part of the game!

1058
00:55:45,296 --> 00:55:48,082
Yes, it was a revelation 
to see it happen so quickly.

1059
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:49,250
Really.

1060
00:55:50,035 --> 00:55:51,043
Peih-Gee.

1061
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:54,088
Is it important 
to assess your situation

1062
00:55:54,213 --> 00:55:56,582
to your 1st participation 
and to adapt

1063
00:55:56,707 --> 00:55:59,118
to place you well the 2nd time?

1064
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:01,387
That's the whole idea of ​​Second Chance.

1065
00:56:01,512 --> 00:56:03,865
Have you learned from your mistakes?

1066
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,700
Are you able to fix them?

1067
00:56:05,825 --> 00:56:08,172
I tried very hard

1068
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:10,884
to differentiate camp life,

1069
00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:12,899
developing relationships...

1070
00:56:13,024 --> 00:56:16,842
You can't get stuck 
in 1st time mistakes.

1071
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:19,138
Abi, what is your second chance about?

1072
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:22,316
It's about growing, 
learning from my mistakes.

1073
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:27,755
In certain situations, 
I could have exploded.

1074
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,674
And I knew how to contain that, to hold myself back,

1075
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:35,142
achieve a new level 
of confidence.

1076
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:39,500
Vytas, you have a unique item 
in your 2nd chance.

1077
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:42,195
You have a loved one who 
not only played, but won.

1078
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,097
Yes. Not only did Aras win, 
he beat Terry.

1079
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,041
Of course I would like to win.

1080
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,346
But if Deitz beat me,

1081
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,343
Aras will always laugh 
at me and say:

1082
00:56:50,468 --> 00:56:52,966
"I beat Deitz 
and you didn't."

1083
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:56,253
Wiglesworth, 
what will be the impact of

1084
00:56:56,378 --> 00:56:59,312
to have left directly 
from the ordeal for here,

1085
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:03,620
without having had time 
to discuss in small groups?

1086
00:57:03,745 --> 00:57:06,527
It will surely have 
a strong impact on the vote.

1087
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:08,588
I don't know if anyone 
knows where it is.

1088
00:57:08,955 --> 00:57:11,906
Me, like everyone else, 
I try to keep up.

1089
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,125
Jeff, people know 
what's going on tonight.

1090
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,763
It doesn't matter what they say. 
A lot of work has been done,

1091
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:20,041
on this beach for 
the past three days.

1092
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:22,451
Vitas, what do you think?

1093
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:25,539
Will it be a random, 
instinctive vote?

1094
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:27,571
Or are there already clans?

1095
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:29,759
Enough people have spoken,

1096
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:31,719
know who 
they want to work with,

1097
00:57:31,844 --> 00:57:33,027
where they are located.

1098
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:35,369
So it's not random at all.

1099
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,817
Woo, how important 
is tonight's vote?

1100
00:57:37,942 --> 00:57:40,653
It is crucial, it will set the tone.

1101
00:57:40,882 --> 00:57:42,630
And personally,

1102
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:45,194
I have no idea. I'm here,

1103
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:47,393
and honestly, 
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1104
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:51,055
And, Abi, interestingly,

1105
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,236
that's where you want to see 
who Woo is looking at.

1106
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:55,268
Exact. There, I see the division.

1107
00:57:55,393 --> 00:57:57,169
- Clearly. 
- And where is she?

1108
00:57:57,294 --> 00:57:59,702
Clearly, a male thing.

1109
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:01,941
Jeff, there is no 
"male thing".

1110
00:58:02,066 --> 00:58:05,185
At this point, the unity of the tribe 
is most important

1111
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:06,821
in the choice of vote.

1112
00:58:06,946 --> 00:58:08,648
Abi, you can't stand still.

1113
00:58:08,939 --> 00:58:10,182
I'm nervous.

1114
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,227
If you leave tonight,

1115
00:58:13,352 --> 00:58:15,129
what will your story be?

1116
00:58:15,379 --> 00:58:16,731
It will be heartbreaking.

1117
00:58:16,856 --> 00:58:18,328
I am not ready to leave.

1118
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:22,036
Woo, how does it feel to hear 
"that would be heartbreaking"?

1119
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:24,038
Yes, it is rough, of course.

1120
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:25,406
But in the end,

1121
00:58:25,531 --> 00:58:27,742
it's about getting along well 
with others.

1122
00:58:27,867 --> 00:58:29,735
He will clearly vote against me.

1123
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,012
I am fixed.

1124
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,091
And beyond that, Abi,

1125
00:58:33,216 --> 00:58:35,824
it taps on what you said you 
want to improve.

1126
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:38,119
- Your social skills. 
- Exact.

1127
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:39,821
We can always do better.

1128
00:58:39,946 --> 00:58:42,824
We always learn, 
every day, little by little.

1129
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,528
Are you worried about making 
the wrong choice tonight?

1130
00:58:47,653 --> 00:58:49,956
I think my gut 
tells me who to vote for.

1131
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:52,935
And I think I'm picking up some signals.

1132
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:54,260
varner

1133
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:56,429
Wiglesworth mentions signals.

1134
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:58,272
How important is it,

1135
00:58:58,397 --> 00:59:00,506
knowing that it was different 
in your time?

1136
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:01,634
It is enormous.

1137
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,467
I've only been picking up signals 
for three days,

1138
00:59:04,592 --> 00:59:06,772
so much so that I slept very little

1139
00:59:06,897 --> 00:59:10,652
and did few of the things 
I would have done in Australia.

1140
00:59:10,777 --> 00:59:12,372
It's a whole other world

1141
00:59:12,497 --> 00:59:14,789
and I don't know if my old school friends

1142
00:59:14,914 --> 00:59:17,683
participate in this new world 
as intensely as I do.

1143
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:19,627
I'm fully in control.

1144
00:59:19,752 --> 00:59:21,988
And I can't wait to see 
the outcome tonight.

1145
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:23,623
Before we vote,

1146
00:59:23,748 --> 00:59:25,424
am I missing something?

1147
00:59:25,549 --> 00:59:28,861
There is an elephant here. Is there 
something huge that went unnoticed?

1148
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:31,806
If so, we'll find out.

1149
00:59:34,933 --> 00:59:37,503
It's my second chance. 
I don't want to spoil it.

1150
00:59:37,628 --> 00:59:39,173
It's an important night.

1151
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:44,844
Good. It's time to vote.

1152
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:46,248
Whoa, over to you.

1153
01:00:03,062 --> 01:00:04,430
I'm sorry, Vitas.

1154
01:00:16,495 --> 01:00:17,977
I wanted to play with you.

1155
01:00:18,268 --> 01:00:20,749
But you still have a 
lot of work to do.

1156
01:00:46,072 --> 01:00:47,707
I will count the votes.

1157
01:00:57,135 --> 01:00:59,785
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

1158
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,487
now is the time to do it.

1159
01:01:06,261 --> 01:01:08,594
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

1160
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:11,264
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

1161
01:01:11,389 --> 01:01:12,874
I will read the votes.

1162
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:15,935
First vote.

1163
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:18,006
Vytas.

1164
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:24,489
Vytas.

1165
01:01:26,377 --> 01:01:27,380
Abi.

1166
01:01:30,842 --> 01:01:31,845
Vytas.

1167
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,963
Help. 
Trois votes Vytas,

1168
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:37,389
three votes Abi.

1169
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,168
Vytas.

1170
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,830
Help. 
Quatre votes Vytas,

1171
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:46,140
four votes Abi,

1172
01:01:46,265 --> 01:01:47,608
there are two votes left.

1173
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:50,778
Vytas. 
Cinq votes Vytas,

1174
01:01:51,028 --> 01:01:52,299
four votes Abi,

1175
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:53,681
one vote remains.

1176
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:58,231
First person eliminated 
from Survivor Second Chance...

1177
01:01:58,356 --> 01:02:00,379
Vitas. 
Bring me your torch.

1178
01:02:11,409 --> 01:02:13,092
Vytas, the tribe has spoken.

1179
01:02:16,462 --> 01:02:18,531
- It's time to go. 
- No hard feelings.

1180
01:02:18,656 --> 01:02:20,875
It's a terrific game. 
No problem.

1181
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:31,119
This vote illustrates one thing

1182
01:02:31,507 --> 01:02:32,754
very clearly:

1183
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:35,214
your second chance 
can end at any time.

1184
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:37,925
So you have to 
make the most of it.

1185
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,852
And as you came to the council,

1186
01:02:39,977 --> 01:02:43,264
fire, in the form of flint, 
will be waiting for you at the camp.

1187
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:46,114
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

1191
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:05,835
Next time in Survivor...

1192
01:03:06,243 --> 01:03:08,680
Sorry that you don't like me 
and that I annoy you.

1193
01:03:08,805 --> 01:03:11,292
Abi is playing the same good old game.

1194
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:12,817
Fuck me and I'll kill you.

1195
01:03:13,143 --> 01:03:15,521
While Varner 
tries to change his.

1196
01:03:15,646 --> 01:03:17,998
These threats must disappear.

1197
01:03:18,315 --> 01:03:20,034
I don't like these people.

1198
01:03:20,284 --> 01:03:23,137
It was a revelation. 
Shake your ass and play!

1199
01:03:29,427 --> 01:03:31,644
I remember saying, 
before coming here:

1200
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:35,704
“I would rather not get caught 
than get caught and go first.”

1201
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:37,129
And it sucks.

1202
01:03:37,842 --> 01:03:41,598
I tried to find people 
to work with,

1203
01:03:41,723 --> 01:03:44,820
and they seem to have found me 
dangerous, it's a sign of respect.

1204
01:03:45,853 --> 01:03:48,282
They were afraid of me, 
and they were right.
