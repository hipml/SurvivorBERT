1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,076
<i>My heart is racing.</i>

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,246
<i>My god. I got it.</i>

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,246
<i>Survivor bucket list.</i>

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,176
<i>Previously on survivor...</i>

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,370
<i>It just came naturally with lavo.</i>

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,936
<i>Let's gata and lavo work together and</i>

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,410
knock out tuku one by one.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,370
- Tuku?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,106
<i>The former gata members</i>

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,890
<i>want to work with us, but
I'd like to shake things up.</i>

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,346
- You're in?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,076
<i>I'm going to try and steer the next vote</i>

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,680
<i>towards one of the
former gata members.</i>

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,410
<i>Sam and Sierra look at
me as an expendable piece.</i>

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,866
<i>They feel like they own me.</i>

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,626
You don't have to work
with them anymore.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,696
Yeah. Yeah.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,936
<i>But Sam, Sierra and Rachel</i>

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,866
<i>they're not gonna see me coming.</i>

20
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,106
Eighth person voted out of survivor 47

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,130
and the first member of our jury: Sierra.

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,240
The tribe has spoken.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,316
Thank you for... For keeping me.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,000
I appreciate another day.

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,176
<i>Tribal council tonight was horrible.</i>

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,106
<i>Rachel and I get blindsided,
Sierra gets sent home,</i>

27
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,200
<i>and we happen to lose
Andy in the process.</i>

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,346
<i>So, gata is no more. Gata got got.</i>

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,750
And now... It's every man for himself.

30
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,890
All right.

31
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,200
That sucks really, really, really bad.

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,151
I want to look out for you, too, and see...

33
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,175
Yeah.

34
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,650
Yeah.

35
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,556
<i>Tonight, both Andy
and lavo flipped on gata.</i>

36
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,726
It was a brilliant acting job,

37
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,750
like, across the board.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,060
<i>These people had me fooled, and</i>

39
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,416
right now, their only mistake

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,386
was keeping me in the game.

41
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,076
That lava group is a bunch

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,346
- of very, very good liars.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,410
<i>And then, I don't even
want to look at Andy.</i>

44
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,866
<i>Yeah.</i>

45
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,656
But I just... I don't know
where to go from here.

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,796
Like, I don't know who to trust.

47
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,890
I kind of had this gut
feeling throughout tribal that

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,346
<i>there's something going on, but</i>

49
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,510
I didn't know what.

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,346
<i>And so, I played my shot in the dark.</i>

51
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,510
Not safe.

52
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,936
Any votes cast for Rachel will still count.

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,866
<i>I played it to Gauge the reactions</i>

54
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,246
<i>of everyone at tribal to
see if they were looking</i>

55
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,416
<i>worried or surprised.</i>

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,006
And based on the
reaction that everyone had

57
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,486
when I played my shot in the dark,

58
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,316
I did not feel like I was the vote,

59
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,696
and I didn't play my idol.

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,510
<i>We just got to play our
own individual game and</i>

61
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,726
try to do what we can for each other.

62
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,200
<i>Moving forward, I'm willing to work</i>

63
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,510
<i>with just about anyone that will have me.</i>

64
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,486
I don't have a lot of options.

65
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,866
My door is open, I'm taking calls.

66
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,696
We'll see who comes knocking.

67
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,890
It was nice that we all stuck
to the exact plan, though.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,316
I want to say that.

69
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,246
- Yeah.
- Yes.

70
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,796
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,726
Andy, thank you for voting with us.

72
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,890
It was a team effort.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,060
Yeah.

74
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,316
<i>After this vote, I'm a certified flipper.</i>

75
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,696
I flipped on gata,

76
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,486
and I feel like this is the first step

77
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,386
of me taking my fate into my own hands.

78
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,486
<i>And so, the only thing I have to do</i>

79
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,936
<i>at this point is damage control</i>

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,796
with the gata members
who are left in the game.

81
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,696
From my perspective,
we come to the merge,

82
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,820
and I feel like I was left
to my own devices a bit.

83
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,416
- Okay.
- So

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,726
I wanted to better my
position in the game.

85
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,390
<i>Since the start of this game, I felt like</i>

86
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,750
I was the outcast.

87
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,626
I feel like I was on the bottom, and I was

88
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,866
<i>sort of an expendable piece.</i>

89
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,386
<i>And so, now, for me to be the one</i>

90
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,006
<i>to get one over on all of
my original tribe members,</i>

91
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,890
<i>like, it's complete survivor satisfaction.</i>

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,246
Not everyone gets to feel that...

93
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,346
That chef's kiss that <i>I
have flipped the script.</i>

94
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,936
Today, the target was
square on your back,

95
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,750
and I spent some
social capital I just gained

96
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,626
to make sure it was Sierra and not you.

97
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,820
<i>Going all the way back to day three</i>

98
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,176
after the immunity challenge
and the moment I had on the mat,

99
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,510
<i>I fell on the bottom of my tribe,</i>

100
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,060
<i>I succumbed to paranoia,</i>

101
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,696
and I thought that was
just gonna be it for me,

102
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
and that was gonna be my legacy.

103
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,626
- I appreciate it.
- All right. Yeah, dude.

104
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,006
<i>And so, I feel like I've been given</i>

105
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,346
the biggest second chance

106
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,726
you could ever have in this game.

107
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,626
<i>I am learning every day out here, and</i>

108
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,006
have just a huge amount
of just overall gratitude that...

109
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,246
That this is my story, and it's continuing,

110
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,240
and I'm still getting to write it.

111
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,240
<i>Dude.</i>

112
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,370
It was Sierra, predominantly,

113
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,060
that was like, "we could do Andy."

114
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,796
- Hah.
- And then, I was like,

115
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,680
"I am not putting Andy's
name down again."

116
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,486
<i>Rachel and I have
both been on the bottom,</i>

117
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,820
<i>and so, I feel like if I
were to have a future</i>

118
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,820
with any of the gata members,
it would definitely be Rachel.

119
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,440
<i>But the stars have not aligned</i>

120
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,656
for various reasons.

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,006
I'm not gonna lie.

122
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,370
That little chain of events...

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,796
- Did make me lose trust - in gata.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,510
<i>I feel like Andy and I have kind of</i>

125
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,820
orbited each other this entire game.

126
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,680
And we've, like, wanted to connect,

127
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,510
and then not wanted to connect

128
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,346
<i>and we just kind of, like,
ping-ponged off each other</i>

129
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,696
<i>for a long time.</i>

130
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,076
It was like a rock and
a hard place for me.

131
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,106
- So I'm sorry, and...
- That's completely fine.

132
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,386
- I want you in this game.
- Yeah.

133
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,626
I wanted you in this
game the entire time.

134
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,006
<i>I feel like</i>

135
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,656
we should be working
together in this game.

136
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,510
<i>That was my plan on day one.</i>

137
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,416
Yeah. We're-we're in alignment.

138
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
- We're synchronized.
- I agree.

139
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,316
I'm like, "you're strong. I'm strong."

140
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,386
- Yeah.
- I feel like it's good.

141
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,726
There were points in the
game where I was like,

142
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,346
"I kind of want to work
with Andy, but, like,

143
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,720
<i>he's frustrating to work with."</i>

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
You have to be careful, though.

145
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,470
I totally... I'm so sorry.
It's just that... I just.

146
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,440
<i>Rachel didn't feel the
same way about me,</i>

147
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,820
<i>so I was leaning in to</i>

148
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,130
my role, which was the bottom player.

149
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,076
Yeah.

150
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,866
I'm in. All right.

151
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,440
Fifth person voted out of survivor 47.

152
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,006
<i>I blindsided Rachel on the Anika vote.</i>

153
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,696
Anika, the tribe has spoken.

154
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,006
<i>Andy blindsided me at the Anika vote</i>

155
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,936
<i>and then he blindsided me</i>

156
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,510
<i>again last night. And so,</i>

157
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,006
I feel like I'm climbing a sand dune

158
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,556
and every step I take
up, I slide two steps down.

159
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,936
Despite all this, it's like,

160
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,416
I've always felt the same way about you.

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,370
Like, we should probably

162
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,796
take this opportunity to, like, actually...

163
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,106
Okay, can we, like...

164
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,346
- Work together?
- Maybe we can work together.

165
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,486
- Actually work together? Yeah.
- For real.

166
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,866
<i>Throughout this game,</i>

167
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,416
<i>I've definitely broken
trust with Rachel, but</i>

168
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,820
I do like her.

169
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,200
I feel like we have chemistry,

170
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,076
and we could definitely
have game chemistry out here.

171
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,820
I feel like, given the game board,

172
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,486
I feel like you are

173
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,430
an absolutely key
relationship for me right now.

174
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,750
- Andy.
- I know.

175
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,380
Is there anyone you're really wary of?

176
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,486
- There's Kyle with the challenges.
- Yeah.

177
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,006
Sue and Caroline, like, don't like him.

178
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,216
- They wanted him out forever.
- That's true.

179
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,556
- That's true.
- He just won't lose.

180
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,796
<i>We've had a rocky road, but we're finally</i>

181
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
<i>in a place now where we
can maybe start to kind of, like,</i>

182
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,680
<i>come together and be like,</i>

183
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,820
"hi." like, "hello. I'm..."

184
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,170
Like, "I'm Andy." "I'm Rachel."

185
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,510
And it's like, almost like

186
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,486
<i>we can start over and,
like, reform something</i>

187
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,486
and work together on some votes.

188
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,270
<i>I still have some sort of life in this game.</i>

189
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,060
<i>I just want to say sorry.</i>

190
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,680
<i>Like, I know it sucks - Sam: Yeah.</i>

191
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,006
To, like, be blindsided like that.

192
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,030
I feel like it was...

193
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,680
We're... from our standpoint, kind of like,

194
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,060
tuku wanted to split you and Sierra up.

195
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,556
Like, thought of you
guys as a power couple,

196
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,820
and that was really hard, and I'm sorry.

197
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,316
And I know how it must feel.

198
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,440
I hope that there's still a way

199
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,510
we could, at some point,
you know, come together.

200
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm ready to play.

201
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,176
<i>I have a vendetta against lavo.</i>

202
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,936
We thought we were working
with lavo and, turns out,

203
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,656
<i>we never had lavo.</i>

204
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,416
<i>So, I'm ready for them to feel</i>

205
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,176
what I had to feel last night.

206
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,251
I want to pick myself
back up and, you know...

207
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:49,750
For real.

208
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,488
'Cause, like, I really
want to play with you guys.

209
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:51,766
Right.

210
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,316
<i>But I need to play along, at least for now,</i>

211
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,726
and then come for my revenge later.

212
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,820
I wasn't turning my back on Sierra.

213
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,750
I think everybody knew that.

214
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,696
So, something had
to be done about that,

215
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,246
from everybody else's
perspective, I get that.

216
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,416
<i>I was a part of that
blindside against Sam,</i>

217
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,890
<i>but I like Sam's mentality.</i>

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,726
He's not getting emotional,
he's not getting pissed.

219
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,766
Did you and Andy mend
fences, or, like, what was...

220
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,130
- What did he say?
- Look, I get it from Andy.

221
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,740
You know, I don't have
any hard feelings there.

222
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:22,176
Right.

223
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,176
<i>And so the fact that Sam's telling me,</i>

224
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,486
<i>"hey, I get it. It's all good."</i>

225
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,170
It's like, "okay, maybe I
can work with this guy."

226
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,416
<i>Even though I worked
with Gabe last night</i>

227
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,036
<i>to take out Sierra, I
think that dude's a player.</i>

228
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,006
I'm starting to get, like, just

229
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,106
I'm so unsure of their dynamics that, like,

230
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,890
we should try and make it be Gabe.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,860
Yeah. Okay.

232
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,060
<i>At some point, we need to get out Gabe,</i>

233
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,860
and, that's what I'm trying to do.

234
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,720
Wow.

235
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,510
Okay.

236
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,696
<i>Tree mail says, "only one of us is safe."</i>

237
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,726
<i>So, what's tricky about
this type of pairing is</i>

238
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,556
you're really trying to think about,

239
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,726
"okay, who will get me to that last stage

240
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,416
<i>"of the challenge where
I can actually compete</i>

241
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,890
<i>for individual immunity?"</i>

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,796
<i>But I also want to be
careful not to pick someone</i>

243
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,866
<i>who's so competitive and so strong that</i>

244
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,936
they're gonna be a
shoe-in to win immunity.

245
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,936
Andy?

246
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,346
Let's do it.

247
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,006
- I'll go with Andy.
- All right.

248
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,486
<i>Sam grabs me and
is like, "Andy, let's go."</i>

249
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,440
"Let's do this." I thought
that was interesting

250
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,130
<i>because I really betrayed him last night.</i>

251
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,626
<i>But I kind of looked at it</i>

252
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,076
<i>as a pretty good opportunity for us to</i>

253
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,936
at least, like, in a challenge setting,

254
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,440
just be kind of bros again.

255
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,750
<i>I'm really down to go
head-to-head against Andy.</i>

256
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,936
<i>If it comes down to me and Andy,</i>

257
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,510
I'm gonna beat him out.

258
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,176
<i>Me and Kyle are partners</i>

259
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,726
going into the challenge today, and that's

260
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,750
<i>a very exciting thing for me</i>

261
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,346
<i>because he's won the
last three challenges.</i>

262
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,796
<i>So,</i>

263
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,316
if there's anybody you
want going to battle with you,

264
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,200
it's the guy who's on a
winning streak, and I got him.

265
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,556
<i>Based on just general
knowledge of the game,</i>

266
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,696
<i>you can expect to work
together in a pair to a point.</i>

267
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,510
And then that other person
in your pair is going to become

268
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,656
<i>your mortal enemy at
the end of this challenge,</i>

269
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,076
<i>which is exactly why I picked Gabe.</i>

270
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,620
I think that I can beat Gabe
when we go head-to-head.

271
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,650
Come on in!

272
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,246
Welcome.

273
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,060
All right, let's get to
today's immunity challenge.

274
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,866
First things first. Got to
take back the necklaces.

275
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,440
Look at sue coming to me.

276
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,960
- Look at this.
- How kind. Thank you.

277
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,510
- Thank you, Kyle.
- Absolutely.

278
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,820
Once again,

279
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,106
individual immunity is back up for grabs.

280
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,106
This morning in tree mail,

281
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,556
you were given instructions
to divide into pairs.

282
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,060
So let's get into those pairs.
Let me see what happened.

283
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,890
Get next to your partner.
Let's see what's what.

284
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,890
So, Kyle, you made these pairs.

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,060
How did that go?

286
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,680
- What happened?
- I think

287
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,430
everybody just kind of jived pretty good.

288
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,386
You know, Gabe and I locked eyes, and

289
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,680
I asked him to be mine and he said yes.

290
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,556
All right, let's review our pairs.

291
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,346
We have sue and Genevieve.

292
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,556
We have Caroline and
Rachel, teeny and sol,

293
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,106
Gabe and Kyle, Andy and Sam.

294
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,060
All right, today's challenge
is gonna run in stages.

295
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,130
<i>For the first stage,</i>

296
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,130
<i>you're gonna crawl
through a narrow tunnel</i>

297
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,930
<i>filled with sand and
retrieve one puzzle step.</i>

298
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,246
<i>You'll then race to dig up a second step.</i>

299
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,076
<i>The first three pairs to
get back with their steps</i>

300
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,440
move on to the next stage.

301
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,130
The last two pairs are
out. No shot at immunity.

302
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,726
For the next stage,

303
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,270
<i>you will use those
steps to build a staircase.</i>

304
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,106
<i>Once you get to the top, you will attempt</i>

305
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,960
<i>to cross a three-level balance beam.</i>

306
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,370
The first two pairs to finish

307
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,796
move on to the final stage.

308
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,060
You are pairs no more.

309
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,596
You will compete as four individuals.

310
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,106
<i>You'll use your hands</i>

311
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,696
<i>and arms to brace against two walls</i>

312
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,076
<i>while your feet balance
on very narrow footholds.</i>

313
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,556
<i>It will be painful. You will feel it.</i>

314
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,696
<i>When you drop, you are out.</i>

315
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,440
Last person left standing

316
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,036
wins immunity, guaranteed a spot

317
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,626
in the final nine... single digits.

318
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,626
Losers, tribal council,
where somebody will be

319
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,036
the ninth person voted out

320
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,346
and become the second
member of our jury.

321
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,656
In addition, you're playing for a reward.

322
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,346
Want to know what you're playing for?

323
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,936
Final four... those last two pairs

324
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,440
that move on to the final round

325
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,510
you will enjoy an afternoon
picnic back at camp.

326
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,820
Blt sandwiches, potato chips, soft drinks.

327
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,006
Worth playing for?

328
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,936
All right. One more thing.

329
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,006
- Ooh.
- No.

330
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,796
The first two pairs who
are out lose their vote

331
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,936
at tonight's tribal council.

332
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,726
- Wow.
- What?!

333
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,060
Yeah, one more thing.

334
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,440
You will take a journey with a chance

335
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,750
- to earn it back.
- Wow.

336
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,500
Now we got some
stakes worth playing for.

337
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,486
- All right.
- We're gonna draw for spots. Here we go.

338
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,030
Let's go.

339
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,796
All right, let's do this.

340
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,036
First three pairs to finish move on

341
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,626
to the next stage.

342
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,486
Last two pairs are out,
no shot at immunity.

343
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,000
Here we go. Survivors ready?

344
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,416
Go! One at a time,

345
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,316
you got to get through this tunnel

346
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,890
and retrieve one puzzle step.

347
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,176
You're working through a very narrow,

348
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,626
very low tunnel with a lot of sand in it.

349
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,626
- Kyle working on those knots.
- Hell, yeah, teeny.

350
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,626
- There goes teeny.
- Hell, yeah, teeny.

351
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,866
Your knot's at your right. Yeah.

352
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,626
You got to then untie that puzzle step,

353
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,680
and get it and you through
the rest of this tunnel.

354
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,176
It is Kyle in the early lead,

355
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,440
yet to lose an immunity challenge.

356
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,626
You're good. Go, Gabe.

357
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,556
Here comes Sam with his puzzle step.

358
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,370
You're good! Here goes Andy.

359
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,370
Three pairs are moving
on, so keep digging.

360
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,796
You're doing good, Genevieve.

361
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,680
Genevieve down on the end.

362
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,820
- And teeny.
- My ass is too big!

363
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,216
Come on, man, -
Probst: There goes Gabe.

364
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,656
We got this. Come on, buddy.

365
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,440
Andy's through. Start digging.

366
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,060
Gabe's through. It is Sam and Andy,

367
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,440
Kyle and Gabe in the lead.

368
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,510
- Genevieve is through.
- Good job, good job, good job!

369
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,556
You're good! Go, sue!

370
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,626
- Let's go, teeny!
- Hell, yeah.

371
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,006
Gabe and Kyle working
on that second step.

372
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,750
Andy and Sam working
on that second step.

373
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,556
You're good. Go, Caroline!

374
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,076
Sorry, Caroline.

375
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,200
Abe and Kyle moving on.

376
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,510
Yeah, sue, yes.

377
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,656
Sue is through. You're good.

378
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,346
- Start digging!
- Okay. Dig.

379
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,100
You're good. Go, sol!

380
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,890
Jeff?

381
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,440
- Our piece is out of the bag.
- Yup.

382
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,696
- That's on you all.
- I'm through.

383
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,696
Caroline's through. Find a step.

384
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,386
You got it, sol.

385
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,556
- Let's go.
- Sol is through.

386
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,130
Everybody now digging
for their second puzzle step.

387
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,060
Sam and Andy... they
are on their puzzle step,

388
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,936
but they cannot get it out.

389
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,936
We're so close.

390
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,176
Kyle and Gabe are moving on.

391
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,106
We're looking for two more pairs.

392
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,346
- Yeah.
- Who is it gonna be?

393
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,696
Look at that. Teeny and sol have it!

394
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,076
They're moving on!
We're looking for one more.

395
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,680
- My god.
- It is going to be Rachel, Caroline,

396
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,416
Sam and Andy, or Genevieve and sue.

397
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,200
Sam and Andy have been
working on that piece for a long time,

398
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,006
- cannot get it out.
- Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,370
Andy's pulling on it.

400
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,130
Can we wedge it out?

401
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,680
One, two and three.

402
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,796
- Go, go, go! Go!
- Good job, guys.

403
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,416
There it is!

404
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,936
Genevieve and sue kept working,

405
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,346
- and they have moved on.
- We did it. We did it.

406
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,006
- Sam and Andy are out.
- We did it. We did it.

407
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,370
Rachel and Caroline are out.

408
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,696
No shot at immunity.

409
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,106
That was hard.

410
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,106
You have lost your votes.

411
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,556
Will have a chance to
earn them back later today.

412
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,936
Sue and Genevieve, you're moving on.

413
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,726
Sol and teeny, you're moving on.

414
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,890
Kyle and Gabe, you're moving on.

415
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,720
Move up to the next
stage and we'll keep going.

416
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,346
All right. Moving on to the next stage,

417
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,316
sue and Genevieve,

418
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,200
sol and teeny, Kyle
and Gabe, you're gonna

419
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,036
use your puzzle steps
to build a staircase,

420
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,130
cross the balance beam
and get to your mat.

421
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,796
First two pairs move
on to the final round.

422
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,246
Last pair is out, no shot at immunity.

423
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,510
Here we go. Survivors ready?

424
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,440
Go! It is one puzzle step

425
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,076
at a time. That's the trick.

426
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,750
And you got to build it in order.

427
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,076
You got to figure out
what piece you need.

428
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,486
These are all puzzle pieces.

429
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,680
The question is which
spots do they go in?

430
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,106
Pull out the next one.

431
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,680
It's a lot of communication.

432
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,176
- What do you got?
- One jumbo.

433
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,510
So, one jumbo in the middle

434
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,510
Kyle, no. Got to go back.

435
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,696
If they don't fit, it's not right.

436
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,480
They may look right,
but they may be a little off.

437
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,796
This is part of it.

438
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,036
- This is a puzzle staircase.
- Got it.

439
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,076
It is not easy. You're
gonna learn as you go.

440
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,440
A lot of experimentation
and a lot of memory.

441
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,726
- Here comes Kyle.
- No.

442
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,416
That's not right. Teeny
now gonna get into it.

443
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,680
She's got one.

444
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,596
That's three for red
and that's four for blue.

445
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,890
One jumbo in the second spot.

446
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,246
Genevieve and sue in the early lead.

447
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,556
- We're good. Good. - Yup.
- Gabe has the second piece.

448
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,936
There goes Genevieve
with another piece.

449
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,656
Blue has got some momentum.

450
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,696
Sol sprints with another piece for red.

451
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,006
- Good.
- Gabe's got one for yellow.

452
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,750
There goes sue with one for blue.

453
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,386
One jumbo at both ends.

454
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,440
Two jumbos on the end?

455
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,130
Teeny with another for red.

456
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,796
- Good.
- This is very tight right now.

457
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,796
- All three pairs are in it.
- Good!

458
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,106
Genevieve and sue
have been in the lead

459
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,656
for most of it, just barely.

460
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,346
Then teeny and sol, then Gabe and Kyle.

461
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,146
- There's another piece for red.
- Yell it out.

462
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,440
Big, small, medium!

463
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,036
- What?
- Teeny big, small, medium, teeny.

464
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,440
- There's another piece for blue.
- One jumbo on the end!

465
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,556
Gabe and Kyle trying to stay in it.

466
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,680
- Go, Gabe.
- Go, buddy, go.

467
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,820
- Sol with another piece.
- Red down to three.

468
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,006
Okay. Bring it up.

469
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,370
Blue down to one.

470
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,820
Here it is... the last piece
for sue and Genevieve.

471
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,626
You're good. One person
across the beam now.

472
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,076
- Let's go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,866
Here comes sol with
another piece for red.

474
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,200
- Big one on this side.
- Gabe with another for yellow.

475
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,626
Sue gonna take on that beam.

476
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,656
It is sue and Genevieve in the lead.

477
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,036
Here comes teeny with another piece.

478
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,696
- Here comes Gabe with another piece.
- No good. No good.

479
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,486
- Good, good, good, good, good!
- Here, try this.

480
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,006
- We have time.
- Sue taking her time on the beam.

481
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,626
Red down to one piece left.

482
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,076
- Got to get it in there.
- Nice.

483
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,836
That's good. You're
good, red. Now it's teeny

484
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,146
- and sol on the balance beam.
- Good.

485
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,556
Gabe with another for yellow.

486
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,696
- You're still in it.
- Big one on this end.

487
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,656
Slow and steady. Slow and steady.

488
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,936
- It's a regular balance beam.
- Teeny whips across it!

489
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,170
- You're good!
- Come on, sol. Just go.

490
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,416
Sue's across!

491
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,130
Go, Genevieve! Kyle
and Gabe now down

492
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,346
to one piece left. Here goes sol.

493
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,750
Come on, sol.

494
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,936
Sol falls. He's got to go back.

495
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,106
Slow and steady. We got tons of time.

496
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,936
Here it is, the last
piece for Kyle and Gabe.

497
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,866
- Got it. Come on, Gabe.
- Yeah.

498
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,726
- Let's go!
- You're still in this.

499
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,246
Kyle and Gabe now are crossing quickly.

500
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,796
- Kyle jumps on that beam.
- Just keep stepping.

501
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,680
This is gonna be a close
finish. Sol now struggling.

502
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,440
You're good, on the
mat. Here comes Gabe.

503
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,936
Sol's across. You're good!

504
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,410
Gabe's across. You're good. Head down!

505
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,200
What a finish on the beam.

506
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,890
Wow!

507
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,130
What a comeback

508
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,106
- by Kyle and Gabe.
- Nice job. Hell yeah.

509
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,316
After having the lead
the entire challenge,

510
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,486
sue and Genevieve fall short

511
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,836
- on the beam. - Sorry.
- No, don't apologize.

512
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,890
What a finish.

513
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,106
That was instant classic.

514
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,556
And now lots of congratulations.

515
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,936
- Good game.
- My god, yeah.

516
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,936
Even with your adversaries.

517
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,486
You're seeing it on display again.

518
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,626
Huge effort.

519
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,030
All right, we're moving
on to the final round.

520
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,860
Wow.

521
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,416
All right.

522
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,200
We're gonna start on
the highest foothold.

523
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,680
At regular intervals, we're gonna move

524
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,890
farther down, making it more difficult.

525
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,170
You are gonna feel it.
When you drop, you're out.

526
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,650
Last person left standing wins immunity.

527
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,936
Everybody looks good.

528
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,650
This challenge is on.

529
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,486
Day 16, survivor 47.

530
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,346
Teeny smiling big as ever.

531
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,340
Sol concentrating.

532
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,076
Done a lot to get here.

533
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,866
You dug through a
tunnel, built a staircase.

534
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,936
You navigated a very tricky
three-level balance beam.

535
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,246
Willpower.

536
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,750
This is about pain.

537
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,696
Good job, guys.

538
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,060
This is as good as it will get.

539
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,620
That next foothold is a lot more narrow.

540
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,146
All right, we're gonna move
down to the next foothold.

541
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,130
Start making your move.

542
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,960
This is a live transition.

543
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,680
If you fall during this process, you're out.

544
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,370
Much more narrow.

545
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,240
Gabe, you got to go.

546
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,796
Good job. Everybody has transitioned...

547
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,890
Hang in there. To the next stage.

548
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,680
Everybody's good.

549
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,750
You're gonna be up
here for five minutes.

550
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,620
Now this challenge is really gonna dig in.

551
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,510
Kyle has won all three

552
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,866
individual immunity
challenges this season,

553
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,200
has not lost.

554
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,370
A chance to extend that to four.

555
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,386
Kyle, how you doing?

556
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,656
Doing all right.

557
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,550
It's not as bad as you thought?

558
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,930
I wouldn't go that far.

559
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,106
<i>Everybody looking really good up there.</i>

560
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,890
<i>Whatever you are doing
right now, it's working.</i>

561
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,036
<i>Watched people do this
challenge for many years.</i>

562
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,370
There's nothing about this
challenge that is comfortable.

563
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,106
Gabe, you all right?

564
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,510
Politely, Jeff, don't talk to me.

565
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,006
You got it.

566
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,580
Politely accepted.

567
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,416
All right, it is time for
another live transition.

568
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,726
Start making your way down.

569
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,416
You can't grip along the way.

570
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
That's good, Gabe. Got to start moving.

571
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,076
Gabe's good. Teeny's good.

572
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,340
Kyle's good. Sol is good.

573
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,960
Gonna be here for ten minutes.

574
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,626
We're now into this third foothold,

575
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,170
and this one is really small.

576
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,890
You cannot give in.

577
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,626
You came out here to play survivor.

578
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,960
You came out here to win.

579
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,270
Outwit, outplay, outlast right now.

580
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,726
This is why you came out here,

581
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,960
for this kind of test.

582
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,656
Teeny, hang in there. Let's go.

583
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,556
Dig in. Find some more pain tolerance.

584
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,750
One minute left in this round.

585
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,176
Then we go to the most narrow foothold.

586
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,000
If we get there.

587
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,936
Sol with a bit of a slip. Can he recover?

588
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,310
Sol trying to get it back.

589
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,696
He's got it.

590
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,510
Come on, guys. Hang tough.

591
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,316
Good news about this challenge.

592
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,176
Nobody knows if you're struggling or not.

593
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,310
Nobody can see anyone else.

594
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,556
But anybody could drop at any moment,

595
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,346
which is why you want to hang in there

596
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,960
as long as you can.

597
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,036
Teeny drops and sol drops.

598
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,416
- Hang in there!
- We have a showdown

599
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,416
- from an original pair.
- Hang in there.

600
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,680
It is Kyle versus Gabe
for individual immunity.

601
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,930
Great job.

602
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,076
All right. We're gonna

603
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,176
make our move to that final stage.

604
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,316
Before you move, let me remind you,

605
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,200
it is a live transition. You both have to

606
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,486
start moving at the same time.

607
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,750
Here we go.

608
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,076
Three, two, one.

609
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,440
Start moving.

610
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,370
Get down to that last foothold.

611
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,130
Both guys have done it.

612
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,386
Now it's on.

613
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,416
Kyle versus Gabe.

614
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,510
The last and most narrow foothold.

615
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,176
This is it. We go here
until somebody drops.

616
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,656
Game on, brother.

617
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,106
Keep digging. Let's go.

618
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,030
Use your arms to brace
against those walls.

619
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,346
This would be Kyle's

620
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,316
fourth individual immunity win,

621
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,620
a perfect record this season.

622
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,416
Kyle drops. He's out.

623
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,936
Gabe wins individual immunity.

624
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,076
Safe tonight at tribal council,

625
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,656
cannot be voted out of this game.

626
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,006
Good job, Gabe.

627
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,796
Wow, what a huge effort.

628
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,036
- Gabe, wow.
- Good job!

629
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,480
- Nice job. - Good job.
- Well done.

630
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,176
Gabe, come on over.

631
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,076
Yay, Gabe.

632
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,680
Gabe, individual immunity is yours.

633
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,006
You are safe tonight,
guaranteed a spot in the final nine.

634
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,006
- You're in single digits.
- Yeah.

635
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,820
- Cannot be voted out.
- Head back over.

636
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,858
Can I hit a dance for
the people back at home?

637
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:40,882
Please do.

638
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,316
My god.

639
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,510
Good job, Gabe.

640
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,106
You rocked it.

641
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,866
All right, little business

642
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,316
to take care of right now.

643
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,486
Andy, Rachel, Caroline, Sam

644
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,076
first two pairs to lose.

645
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,486
You have lost your vote.

646
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,060
So as of now, you do not have a vote.

647
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,486
Good news is you're gonna
leave here, go on a journey

648
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,130
where you will have a
chance to earn it back.

649
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,106
It is not guaranteed.

650
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,386
Grab your stuff, head out.

651
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,726
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck, guys.

652
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,246
- Good luck, guys.
- Thank you. - Thanks.

653
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,820
You will return back
to camp this afternoon

654
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,440
before tribal council.

655
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,680
Everybody else going
back to camp, but sol,

656
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,696
Kyle, Gabe and teeny

657
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,416
you're gonna enjoy an afternoon picnic.

658
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,076
A little bit of a break from the game,

659
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,416
a chance to bond, fuel for your body,

660
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,750
help your mind for
the big decision tonight.

661
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,246
Who's gonna be the
ninth person voted out

662
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,820
and become the second
member of the jury?

663
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,240
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at tribal.

664
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,036
<i>I am a little disappointed in myself</i>

665
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,076
<i>because I thought that I can beat Gabe.</i>

666
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,440
<i>I really gave it my all, but now</i>

667
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,820
I'm a sitting duck.

668
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,820
<i>I can be picked off just
as easy as the next guy.</i>

669
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,960
<i>So, I'm nervous about tonight.</i>

670
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,200
I mean, what can I say?
Th-these are the moments.

671
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,410
If you want this, you got
to apply to be on survivor.

672
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,370
<i>It's a very interesting
dynamic after the challenge.</i>

673
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,726
<i>We're all split up into
three separate groups.</i>

674
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,246
<i>There are the no-vote journey people,</i>

675
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,820
<i>and they're off on a different
island somewhere doing</i>

676
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,176
god knows what to try
and earn their vote back.

677
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,346
<i>Then there's Genevieve and sue,</i>

678
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,006
<i>who didn't lose their vote, but</i>

679
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,440
they didn't get a reward, either.

680
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,890
My god. My god.

681
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,696
<i>And then there's the reward group:</i>

682
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,106
<i>Me, Kyle, teeny and sol.</i>

683
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,696
Congrats, guys.

684
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200
Gabe's not with us right now.

685
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,346
<i>This is one of the best days of my life.</i>

686
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,866
This is bucket list. This is, "my god.

687
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,200
I'm wearing the necklace."

688
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,386
<i>And then, on top of that, it's the first</i>

689
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,200
<i>proper meal I've had in 16 days.</i>

690
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,796
<i>I got dizzy from just how good it felt.</i>

691
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,370
I'm hallucinating right now.

692
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,936
<i>All we're hearing</i>

693
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,200
<i>from Gabe right now is
just pleasureful moaning</i>

694
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,656
<i>and groaning as he bites into this bit.</i>

695
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,866
<i>And on the other side of me,</i>

696
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,176
I have sol, who is just a burp machine.

697
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,510
<i>I grew up burping in front of my family.</i>

698
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,006
Whenever I'm just so
comfortable around people,

699
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,346
<i>I'll let it go.</i>

700
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,316
I was trying to keep up with sol.

701
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,486
<i>It was impossible.</i>

702
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,006
<i>I'd much rather have a cool</i>

703
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,680
cartoon burp than, like, a weak-ass burp.

704
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,006
<i>I would chug some soda
to try to force more out,</i>

705
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,076
and I would just get a little, like...

706
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,726
And then, sol just would
be, like, have his head down

707
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,820
<i>and lift up and just go...</i>

708
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,386
And then put his head
back down, and I was like,

709
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,386
<i>"I feel small right now."</i>

710
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,240
Yeah.

711
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,076
I mean, you wanted Sam last night.

712
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,416
You know I did.

713
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,890
How do you feel about tonight?

714
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm so down for it.

715
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,060
<i>Sam, I necessarily don't want to get out.</i>

716
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,866
<i>I believe he trusts me.</i>

717
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,146
<i>But honestly, the reason why
I would vote out Sam is 'cause</i>

718
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,656
<i>that's what everyone wants
to do, and I'm riding the boat.</i>

719
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,890
It's not my name, number one.

720
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,280
That's the most important thing.

721
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,510
My name's not on there.

722
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,076
Genevieve will be on board

723
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,416
with whatever we bring to her.

724
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,370
Sue will give us the majority we need

725
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,680
if we get Genevieve.

726
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,060
<i>This is the first time</i>

727
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,486
<i>I'm actually vulnerable in this game.</i>

728
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,486
<i>I'm nervous because</i>

729
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,726
you never know what Genevieve
and sue would be talking about.

730
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,656
But, you know, I don't
really see Genevieve

731
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,170
as, like, a super social,
like, a thinker in this game.

732
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,030
This is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

733
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,000
Sol wants Gabe out.

734
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,890
<i>The first time tuku went to tribal,</i>

735
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,626
<i>Kyle wrote my name down.</i>

736
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,866
<i>So tonight, my plan was
to do a blindside on Kyle.</i>

737
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,416
I quite like Gabe,

738
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,796
and I don't want him to go home yet.

739
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,726
I know. He's such a good guy.

740
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,246
- That's a huge...
- And so, like, my preference would be

741
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,076
get out sol.

742
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,060
<i>But I learned that sol is after Gabe.</i>

743
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,170
If I lose Gabe

744
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,726
like, my whole game is shot.

745
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,130
- Sue is... yeah.
- You know...

746
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,920
- She's great to have on our side.
- Yeah.

747
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,176
- I think it's, like, very nice.
- Sue is not gonna be

748
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,176
the person to be, like, "hey, everybody,

749
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,480
it's sol tonight."

750
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,060
We could do a big blindside on sol.

751
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,486
It would have to be

752
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,680
a total blindside because he's so clever.

753
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,486
<i>I've had a bee in my
bonnet since my lavo beach,</i>

754
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,176
<i>where sol targeted my ally Rome.</i>

755
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,416
And we've mended fences-ish.

756
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,656
But, like, <i>in this game,
I am so petty, and so,</i>

757
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,316
I've really just been waiting.

758
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,820
"When can I get sol?"

759
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,556
<i>I'm going into this mystery journey</i>

760
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,486
without a vote.

761
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,726
<i>I feel vulnerable and in danger</i>

762
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,416
<i>and completely powerless.</i>

763
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,820
<i>I have to find a way to get my vote back.</i>

764
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,076
The last two times, it was

765
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,556
- the same puzzle for every person.
- Yeah.

766
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,556
Three people were separated
and did the same puzzle,

767
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,510
and if they won, they got their vote back.

768
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,386
<i>I went into the challenge with such heart</i>

769
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,796
<i>and such motivation</i>

770
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,720
<i>that this was gonna
be the one that I won.</i>

771
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,100
I... I really wanted that one.

772
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,036
<i>I want it because I don't want</i>

773
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,416
<i>to be the guy that's scratching to,</i>

774
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,750
you know, hang on.

775
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,246
<i>I don't know what's in store, but</i>

776
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,486
<i>I still have a fighting
shot at getting myself</i>

777
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,936
back into this game.

778
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,480
All right.

779
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,680
<i>These journeys are like
nightmare fuel for me.</i>

780
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,200
<i>We have to compete in a game,</i>

781
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,866
<i>and the loser of this game
is going to be the one player</i>

782
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,796
<i>that loses their vote tonight.</i>

783
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,726
<i>I'm like, "okay, survivor</i>

784
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,230
put me on this journey. Like,
let's see how things shake out."

785
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,720
- Hey. - Hey.
- Hey, there.

786
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,480
It was nice.

787
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,200
No.

788
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,936
I'm not depressed. I'm full.

789
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,486
<i>So coming back into camp,</i>

790
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,796
<i>the four of us have this plan to tell sue</i>

791
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,170
and Genevieve about Sam.

792
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,626
<i>And it doesn't really take</i>

793
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,726
any time for sol to just shout out,

794
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,410
"so, we decided Sam."

795
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

796
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,106
<i>And everybody agreed
upon Sam to go home.</i>

797
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,370
But, yeah, I think

798
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,106
if everyone's cool with Sam tonight,

799
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,416
we got numbers right now.

800
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,696
We all worked together last night.

801
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,556
Let's work together again tonight.

802
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,130
<i>Everyone is happy with Sam going, but</i>

803
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,890
unfortunately for everyone else.

804
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,316
I had a lot of downtime with sue.

805
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,200
<i>And when I pitch the
idea of blindsiding sol,</i>

806
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,370
<i>sue is open to it on the condition</i>

807
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,750
<i>that I talk to Gabe.</i>

808
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,370
<i>He is the missing piece to this plan</i>

809
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,000
going forward or not.

810
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,820
Yeah.

811
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,936
Yeah.

812
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,060
The reason Gabe is pivotal
to this plan is because.

813
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,486
<i>Gabe has the numbers behind him.</i>

814
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,510
<i>All of the tukus will listen to him.</i>

815
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,200
<i>He's the one who will make this happen.</i>

816
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,006
Okay.

817
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,370
<i>And so, I think</i>

818
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,006
<i>I can use the conversation
from this morning</i>

819
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,106
<i>to my advantage because it allows me</i>

820
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,796
<i>to approach it in a way that he will be</i>

821
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,696
extra receptive to.

822
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,000
Basically, the name
that was said... Was you.

823
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,370
<i>So me and Genevieve
go on a walk together</i>

824
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,006
<i>and she tells me.</i>

825
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,346
<i>She goes, "hey, this morning,</i>

826
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,726
sol and teeny were
throwing your name out."

827
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,130
My preference would
be... I would like - yeah.

828
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,416
<i>To take out the, like, subtle threats.</i>

829
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,200
<i>Literally, no one is talking about sol.</i>

830
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,216
<i>And she said, "I think that
we should make a move</i>

831
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,316
for sol tonight."

832
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,176
He's good with
everybody, and I think - no.

833
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,520
<i>Him and teeny want to
play between gata and tuku.</i>

834
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:47,866
No,

835
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,346
I-I think you're right.

836
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,750
<i>There are dangerous
players I'm working with that</i>

837
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,820
I need to be prepared to strike against

838
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,246
before they strike me. And

839
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,796
<i>if sol is coming after me,
he's gonna regret that.</i>

840
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,796
It'll burn my bridge with teeny,

841
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,106
which makes me more
vulnerable to you guys.

842
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,680
- And, yeah, yeah.
- But, like,

843
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:08,076
if he skates by a couple
more, like, it will be you,

844
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,759
it will be Kyle, and then it'll turn to me.

845
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:11,200
Yeah.

846
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,060
<i>I think we could do this</i>

847
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,246
<i>but there are people
that I need to be on board.</i>

848
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,270
- Yeah.
- Okay.

849
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,486
Sol's been, like,

850
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,076
kind of working
everybody. Like, everybody

851
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,060
feels like sol is their bff.

852
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,246
Would you be okay writing sol's name?

853
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,680
<i>I'm hearing from Genevieve
that sol's gonna go.</i>

854
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,680
Sam's not even the target anymore.

855
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,200
Yeah.

856
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,486
<i>Hey, I'll do whatever you guys say</i>

857
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,036
<i>as long as I stay around.</i>

858
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,370
<i>I'm just really hoping that
the rest of the tribe mates</i>

859
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,486
that have votes are going
to side with me and decide

860
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,820
to keep me in this game
a day longer than sol.

861
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,130
Yeah. Yeah.

862
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,060
<i>I am a planner, and this sol plan has.</i>

863
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,346
"Genevieve mushaluk" written all over it.

864
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,696
<i>But it's very complicated to pitch a plan</i>

865
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,936
<i>when you really have</i>

866
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,626
no idea what ingredients
are going into your plan.

867
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,200
<i>And how do you count the numbers</i>

868
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,936
<i>when four people are on a journey?</i>

869
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,076
<i>And will they all come back with a vote?</i>

870
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,060
<i>Will they come back with no votes?</i>

871
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,246
<i>And we need one more vote to do it.</i>

872
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,076
<i>So, it all depends</i>

873
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,660
<i>on what's coming back from the journey.</i>

874
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,346
<i>It is a game for the four of us to play</i>

875
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,200
<i>against one another in which three of us</i>

876
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,656
will earn our vote back, and one of us

877
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,200
<i>will be without a vote at tribal council.</i>

878
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,030
So, the stakes are high.

879
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,346
<i>This game is kind of</i>

880
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,866
like building a house of cards.

881
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,076
<i>We have to stack up these cards</i>

882
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,130
<i>and not knock over the tower.</i>

883
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,866
<i>We have to form triangles</i>

884
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,656
on top of triangles on top of triangles.

885
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,960
<i>And each card that you
put down feels high-stakes.</i>

886
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,170
Got it?

887
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,480
Wow.

888
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,246
Seriously.

889
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,106
<i>I knocked over the tower.</i>

890
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,036
<i>It all tumbled down,
and I lost my vote tonight.</i>

891
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,060
- Back to camp we go.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

892
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,346
<i>Not a fan of losing my vote.</i>

893
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,626
<i>I like having some control in the game,</i>

894
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,036
and I'm kind of opinionated

895
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,680
on who I want to have go home today.

896
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,456
I think a lot of people are on board

897
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,456
- with that right now.
- I agree.

898
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,796
I am, definitely.

899
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,386
<i>If Kyle gets to the end,</i>

900
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,696
<i>he's just gonna be
absolutely hard to beat.</i>

901
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,486
<i>Kyle is a big challenge threat.</i>

902
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,750
And I could see him winning

903
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,146
- all the way to the end, and, like...
- Yeah.

904
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,726
<i>I really want it to be Kyle, but</i>

905
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,656
without a vote, it's more
challenging for me to do so.

906
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,316
- All right. - Let's do it.
- All right. Let's go.

907
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,556
<i>I don't have agency</i>

908
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,766
regarding who goes home tonight,

909
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,820
<i>and so, I'm worried.</i>

910
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,130
Hey!

911
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,510
Welcome back!

912
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,416
No way.

913
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,246
<i>Sam, Rachel, Caroline and Andy</i>

914
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,796
<i>all return from the journey.</i>

915
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,316
And of course, Caroline's the person

916
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,386
<i>who loses her vote.</i>

917
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,866
<i>And I needed Caroline's vote</i>

918
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,696
'cause she was gonna
vote with us no matter what.

919
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,076
We basically had to
do, like, reverse jenga.

920
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,106
We had to build a tower,

921
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,246
and first one to knock
over the tower lost their vote.

922
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,556
The way the votes are
shaking out right now are me,

923
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,486
<i>Kyle, Genevieve and
sue are gonna go sol.</i>

924
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,386
<i>And because Caroline</i>

925
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,556
doesn't have her vote,
five is a majority tonight.

926
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,346
<i>So, if we can get</i>

927
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,386
<i>one more vote, there's our five for sol.</i>

928
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,416
The difficult part of this is

929
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,656
who else gets to know this is happening.

930
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,750
Hi. So, what are we discussing?

931
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,696
One of the stronger men going home.

932
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,726
Right. Yeah.

933
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,130
<i>I am fully aware that lying to teeny</i>

934
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,696
<i>and voting out sol is going
to burn my bridge with teeny.</i>

935
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,216
She is someone I have a complex
relationship with in this game.

936
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,486
I care deeply about her. I
believe she cares about me.

937
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:58,860
<i>But I still think that this
is the right move for me.</i>

938
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,386
Sol.

939
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:08,656
I was thinking that he can't...

940
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,696
We can't keep him for a long time.

941
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,176
<i>I think that Genevieve is</i>

942
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,696
feeling pretty froggy tonight.

943
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,176
I think she's ready to jump
and hop and make a big move.

944
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,130
<i>But my current viewpoint
on how to use sol</i>

945
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,626
is to really just kind of use
him for a couple more votes

946
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,130
and get rid of him.

947
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,386
<i>And on the other hand,</i>

948
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,696
whenever there's a really
exciting blindside in the works,

949
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,486
the last thing you want to be is,

950
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,246
you know, missing the boat on that.

951
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,656
Check back in with me and
I'm, like, if it's lined up, then...

952
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,286
- Then you'd do it?
- Yeah, that'll be fine.

953
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,866
Let me see if I can line this up.

954
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:48,200
<i>As luck would have it, Andy told me</i>

955
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,750
sol was also on his mind. Not for tonight.

956
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,440
But with a little encouragement,

957
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,750
Andy's also in on this plan for sol tonight.

958
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,176
<i>And then the question Mark became</i>

959
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,680
what about Sam and Rachel?

960
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,346
<i>And I thought,</i>

961
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,820
<i>let's bring in Rachel and let's let</i>

962
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,580
Rachel decide does
she want Sam in or out?

963
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,410
Okay.

964
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,820
<i>I am now an underdog in this game.</i>

965
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,076
And so, as much as I

966
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,750
<i>owe sol for sending me the advantage,</i>

967
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,006
<i>I am genuinely torn.</i>

968
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,750
<i>But even more importantly,</i>

969
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,036
<i>I don't know if I should
let Sam in on the vote.</i>

970
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,316
<i>This tribal</i>

971
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,370
is my opportunity to
show these new allies

972
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,936
that I am with them and
that they can count on me.

973
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,316
I want to, like, know what's happening.

974
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,176
I know. Hey, I can talk to you more later.

975
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,510
Just know that we are
still looking out for you.

976
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,556
I can't tell you who it
is. It's not you. It's not.

977
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,006
<i>I feel very uneasy.</i>

978
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,130
I've been a social pariah around here.

979
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,130
Like, nobody wants to talk to me.

980
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,106
<i>Rachel is the only person in the game</i>

981
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,486
<i>that I believe I can genuinely trust,</i>

982
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,386
and I... I need her right now.

983
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,076
So, I'm just gonna guess,

984
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,191
and you don't have to
confirm anything, obviously.

985
00:46:59,215 --> 00:47:00,215
Yeah.

986
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,060
You're working with tuku.

987
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,440
You're blindsiding one of the lavo.

988
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,316
Yeah? Okay.

989
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,076
I want...

990
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,564
Please. Please don't
blow up my spot, okay?

991
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:16,216
I won't. I won't.

992
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,790
Okay. I won't.

993
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,006
<i>I get the information from Rachel</i>

994
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,510
<i>that there is a plan in the works</i>

995
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,696
<i>to blindside sol.</i>

996
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,176
<i>And maybe I shouldn't blow
up her spot right after I tell her,</i>

997
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,060
<i>"hey, I'm not gonna blow up your spot,"</i>

998
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,680
<i>but I have to be able
to look out for myself.</i>

999
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:39,890
<i>And so, it's time to cause chaos.</i>

1000
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,130
It's time to blow this thing up.

1001
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,246
Okay.

1002
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,936
You're going home tonight.

1003
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,680
- S... shut up.
- Let's go.

1004
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,200
Are you serious?

1005
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,510
I just found out two seconds ago.

1006
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,060
Rachel.

1007
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,680
<i>She was like, "Sam, please
don't blow up my spot."</i>

1008
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,656
<i>And that's exactly what I'm doing.</i>

1009
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,486
They're telling you it's
me, telling me it's Kyle,

1010
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,130
and they're voting you out.

1011
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,626
<i>Me?! I'm going home tonight?!</i>

1012
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,440
<i>My first reaction is panic.</i>

1013
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,036
But I work the best
when I'm at the bottom.

1014
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,370
- And I promise you...
- Okay.

1015
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,316
That if we don't do something,

1016
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,526
- you're going home tonight.
- Okay.

1017
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,170
You, me, Andy, Genevieve and teeny.

1018
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,106
I want sue out of this game because

1019
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,726
<i>sue is probably the most insulated player</i>

1020
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,316
in this game.

1021
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,820
I love you so much.

1022
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,246
<i>Not only does she have.</i>

1023
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,726
<i>Caroline as a tight number one.</i>

1024
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,866
<i>She's got Gabe and she's starting</i>

1025
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,346
<i>to get inroads with
Andy, Rachel, Genevieve.</i>

1026
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,486
<i>If I can get sue out,</i>

1027
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,750
<i>it'll free up a lot more
players to work with,</i>

1028
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,696
and that's important to me at this point.

1029
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,936
I think you blow up everybody's
game if you take out sue.

1030
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,000
- All right. Sue.
- What's Caroline got to do?

1031
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,036
- Sue.
- All right.

1032
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,485
And Gabe can't... Nobody
on tuku can find out.

1033
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:00,866
Okay.

1034
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,656
<i>My head is on the chopping block.</i>

1035
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,346
<i>The sun's coming down.</i>

1036
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,656
<i>I know tribal council is coming, and</i>

1037
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,920
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

1038
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,060
The vote was me tonight.

1039
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,726
- What?
- Yup.

1040
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:17,410
So, you, Genevieve, Andy,
Sam and I are voting sue.

1041
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,936
Teeny, vote sue.

1042
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,006
Okay.

1043
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,626
<i>My red flags just instantly go up.</i>

1044
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,866
I have heard nothing about this.

1045
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,370
<i>And sol's my number one ally</i>

1046
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,680
<i>and best friend in this game.</i>

1047
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,006
<i>So, my first instinct is,</i>

1048
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,440
we have to do something about it,

1049
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,000
we have to save sol.

1050
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,796
Lay it on me. What are you thinking?

1051
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,130
I'm trying to take out sue tonight.

1052
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,246
And if you vote with us, she's gone.

1053
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,696
Who do you... Sue?

1054
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,130
- Who do you got?
- It's me and lavo.

1055
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,680
And I think if we take out sue... Yeah.

1056
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,076
Tuku is no more.

1057
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,936
<i>Things have totally exploded.</i>

1058
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,416
I need people to make ballsy
moves with me in this game.

1059
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,060
<i>Sam is ready to make his big move.</i>

1060
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,626
<i>He wants to gun for tuku.</i>

1061
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,726
Dude, this is an exciting day.

1062
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,316
This is the best day yet.

1063
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,750
<i>But can I work with Sam again</i>

1064
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,866
<i>and get rid of sol later on?</i>

1065
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,726
<i>This is, like, very big
decisions that need to be made</i>

1066
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,486
in a really short amount of time,

1067
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,796
<i>because tribal is looming.</i>

1068
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,170
<i>It's happening, like, very soon.</i>

1069
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,720
We're good.

1070
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,270
What?

1071
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,176
<i>Unfortunately for me, my beautiful plan,</i>

1072
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,346
<i>which was carefully laid out,</i>

1073
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:52,936
<i>all the pieces were in place...</i>

1074
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,386
- It's...
- I don't really understand

1075
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:55,976
how they could have
the numbers to do you.

1076
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,486
<i>I feel it</i>

1077
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:01,176
slipping through my fingers,
and have the panic of,

1078
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,510
"no. Like, what if it is not sol?"

1079
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,750
Yeah, yeah, so, it was rach...

1080
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,270
They pulled Rachel in.

1081
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:13,750
<i>Sol is coming to me and teeny,</i>

1082
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,346
and teeny's getting
pulled in, and it is a mess.

1083
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,960
Sue is the best target.

1084
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,651
<i>'Cause we were already
gonna do that. So it's not like...</i>

1085
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,486
- You guys want to do Kyle then?
- Yeah.

1086
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,696
We're getting Kyle out.

1087
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,556
It's Kyle. Will you please vote Kyle?

1088
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,060
I saved you.

1089
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,346
<i>I'm pretty conflicted about what to do.</i>

1090
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,510
<i>There's so much going on</i>

1091
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,890
<i>and there's so much chaos.</i>

1092
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,416
<i>It's starting to dawn on me</i>

1093
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,176
that I should have never
said anything to Sam.

1094
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,370
Sol is just freaking out.

1095
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,510
<i>Once word spread that sol was getting</i>

1096
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,006
more paranoid, more paranoid,

1097
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,346
<i>we all changed all of our plans.</i>

1098
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,820
<i>And we kept going
back and forth, jumping</i>

1099
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,720
from person to person
to person to person.

1100
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,820
<i>It's just a lot of running around,</i>

1101
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,316
<i>it's a lot of craziness, and</i>

1102
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,580
I'm starting to sweat
a little bit on this one.

1103
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,936
<i>It's an absolute mess,
and the sun is setting,</i>

1104
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,106
and we do not have time for a mess.

1105
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,416
- Yeah.
- This is nuts.

1106
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,820
This is nuts, man.

1107
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,060
Conversations are still live

1108
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,330
<i>about "what are we gonna do?"</i>

1109
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,060
<i>Okay, is it go ahead with sol</i>

1110
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,976
<i>or are we pivoting to
something else? If we're pivoting,</i>

1111
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,416
<i>who are we pivoting to... sue or Kyle?</i>

1112
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,750
<i>And the sun sets and it stops.</i>

1113
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,246
And those are the questions left.

1114
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,316
And there are no
answers to those questions.

1115
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,680
Now bring in the first member of our jury.

1116
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,556
All right, so let's review today.

1117
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,076
Three-stage challenge that ran in pairs,

1118
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,890
but it ended up in a showdown
between Kyle and Gabe.

1119
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,386
Gabe pulled it out.

1120
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:24,820
Before we get into the details,

1121
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,076
one of the things that I noticed was

1122
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,656
this group camaraderie.

1123
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,316
Lots of people hugging,

1124
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,076
"congratulations, man. I gave it my best."

1125
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,556
But at a certain point,

1126
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,820
the reminder that it's
personal is going to take over.

1127
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,680
So, Kyle, can you have both? Can you

1128
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,060
have a group of people

1129
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,036
congratulate each
other, and you mean it,

1130
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,936
and then you immediately start thinking,

1131
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,596
"but I'm taking you out,
and you have no idea"?

1132
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:50,106
Yeah, Gabe and I were a
perfect example of that today

1133
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,696
because, like, when Gabe was able

1134
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,656
to pull off that w today, I
was genuinely proud of him.

1135
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,130
I was happy for that.

1136
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,696
But then, obviously, that
comes with repercussions

1137
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,440
because that means that necklace
is no longer around my neck,

1138
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,076
which means my
safety is not guaranteed.

1139
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,076
But then there's the war at hand, where

1140
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,006
we do have to face off, we do have

1141
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,866
to start talking about what
we're going to do and-and

1142
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:14,416
who needs to go home and why.

1143
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,656
Genevieve, does it make it harder

1144
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,796
to vote somebody out when you

1145
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,130
have established a society

1146
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,656
that says, "we're gonna
treat each other kindly,

1147
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,680
even in defeat"?

1148
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,200
I don't think so because

1149
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:31,936
everyone sitting here
is... A fan of the game.

1150
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,936
And so they can compartmentalize

1151
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,890
the different aspects of the game.

1152
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,176
And it doesn't feel good, but it's not

1153
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,890
because we've decided to give
it our all and be a community.

1154
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,696
It just doesn't feel
good for other reasons.

1155
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,176
But for me, personally, I
saw my name on parchment

1156
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,006
at the first tribal council I was at.

1157
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,796
And that gave me, you know,

1158
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,200
007 license to kill in this game

1159
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:58,750
because that could have
been my last tribal council.

1160
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,316
So, Sam, one of the elements of today

1161
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,866
was four people lost votes.

1162
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,866
You had a chance

1163
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,680
to get 'em back. How did that go?

1164
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,130
I was able to finally

1165
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,750
earn my voting power back in the game

1166
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,036
after feeling pretty helpless

1167
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,680
for the last two tribal councils.

1168
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,820
But, you know, Caroline
ended up losing her vote tonight.

1169
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:23,315
So, Caroline, - you will not vote tonight?

1170
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:23,726
No.

1171
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,486
How impactful is that
with all the uncertainty

1172
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:27,416
that's going on?

1173
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,890
It's a really weird feeling

1174
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,796
in that there's so
much chaos happening,

1175
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,556
even just behind me
in this very moment and

1176
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,556
leading up to tribal council.

1177
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,416
And I want to know what's
happening, and I want

1178
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,316
to be in the know, but it feels so bizarre

1179
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,696
because I actually
can't do much about it.

1180
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,316
I can share the knowledge
that I have and my opinions,

1181
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,866
but at the end of the day, I
can't put pen to parchment.

1182
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,820
Sue, something else I'm noticing

1183
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,890
about tonight's tribal is from
the second you sat down,

1184
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,936
there are tiny little
conversations happening.

1185
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,750
Yeah. In my peripheral vision right now,

1186
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,440
I can see conversations going on.

1187
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:02,510
So, it-it's sort of freaking me out a little

1188
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,316
that people are having
these conversations already

1189
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,796
and we're still trying to
have conversations with you.

1190
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,246
Sol, the chaos that
is happening right now

1191
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,440
is this what it was like back at camp?

1192
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,130
Yes. You know, you would like

1193
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,750
to have a solid plan going in.

1194
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,316
And there was just confusion
and then more confusion.

1195
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,316
Bottom line, this game
means a lot to everybody,

1196
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,130
so you want to make sure
that you're all on the same page.

1197
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,796
And, it looked pretty chaotic, yeah.

1198
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,890
- Andy, do you agree?
- Absolutely.

1199
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,280
The chaos is happening right now

1200
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,596
because we did not finish at camp.

1201
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,936
I don't feel like there's a need to hide it.

1202
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,556
It was explosive, this scramble today.

1203
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,176
Pure disarray. No one's
feeling secure right now.

1204
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,486
I think there are conversations
that still need to be had,

1205
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,006
but we're sitting here
answering your questions,

1206
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,006
and we're just trying to
deal with that right now.

1207
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,200
And it's your tribal,

1208
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:45,626
- so, I got some questions.
- Sure.

1209
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,680
- You got some talking to do.
- Definitely.

1210
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,820
- We got all night.
- You just want everyone

1211
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:53,316
to shush? Except for
me, and I... let me whisper.

1212
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,200
I want to get my whispers
in, and then no one else can.

1213
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,486
That would make me
feel the most secure,

1214
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,036
but that's not possible out here.

1215
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,750
Teeny, survivor requires you to be

1216
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,796
on point at any given
time, but this is very specific.

1217
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,386
This is, "not sure what the plan is",

1218
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:11,510
"not sure who I can trust. We only have

1219
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:15,556
"a few minutes before we
vote, so I must..." What?

1220
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,176
- Can you repeat the question?
- Yeah.

1221
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,556
If there was one skill
that you could rely on

1222
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,036
right now, what would it be?

1223
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,416
Adaptability.

1224
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,866
I mean, I've had different experiences

1225
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,866
going to tribal council.

1226
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,130
I've gone in confident and sure

1227
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,890
and been blindsided
and absolutely wrong.

1228
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,866
I've gone in confident and sure

1229
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,176
and been right and
found people I could trust.

1230
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,176
But tonight, it's completely unfamiliar

1231
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,076
because I am going in absolutely unclear

1232
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,866
of what I'm doing,

1233
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,596
what the people who
I've talked to are doing.

1234
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,200
And I think a lot of us
are feeling that way.

1235
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,626
Genevieve, that's the fear.

1236
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,176
You can never trust,

1237
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,726
ultimately, if the last
conversation was the last one

1238
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,200
you needed to have.

1239
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,750
What I would say is,

1240
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,866
good players are good at
deciphering new information,

1241
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,510
I.e., my plan needs to change

1242
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,626
from information that's just noise.

1243
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,890
And so, I am going to stay the course.

1244
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,130
And I think there are
other players out here

1245
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,246
who want to make moves

1246
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:16,316
and can also tell the difference
between news and noise.

1247
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:20,200
Kyle, is this distracting,
this animated conversation?

1248
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,510
Heck, yeah, it's distracting.

1249
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,006
There's something about it that just,

1250
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,386
is, like, tugging on my ear.

1251
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,626
Every time I see somebody
lean over or do something,

1252
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:30,106
all I want to do is, like,
climb in the middle of it

1253
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:33,386
- and hear what's being said.
- Yeah.

1254
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,620
Sol gonna join in.

1255
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,696
So, Caroline, do you have
an idea of why there's chaos?

1256
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,556
All I know is that chaos is beneficial

1257
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,556
for people who are in bad spots.

1258
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,626
If you're in a good spot,
and you have good "plaos"...

1259
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:56,130
And you have a good plan,
chaos can just destroy you.

1260
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,246
So I'm not a fan of chaos. I... yeah.

1261
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:02,626
But again, I'm not voting,
so, I'll let the chaos happen.

1262
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,626
But they can vote for you.

1263
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,386
You know, that is true.

1264
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,416
I do not like that.

1265
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,796
But the thing is, we also have to think

1266
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,386
about what are the other dynamics here.

1267
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,440
And I love what Genevieve said.

1268
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,346
The best survivor players
can tell signal from noise.

1269
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,866
And I'm seeing a lot of noise right now.

1270
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,936
Kyle, it's happening, it's real, it's alive.

1271
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,176
This is a million-dollar vote.

1272
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,370
Somebody's dream
will be squashed tonight.

1273
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,370
This is it, man. The game is afoot.

1274
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,936
It's happening right before your eyes

1275
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,346
and right next to my ears.

1276
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,200
I mean, this is what I signed up for.

1277
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,936
I didn't know it was
gonna be this chaotic.

1278
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,510
There's a lot of things to balance

1279
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,200
when you have so many people.

1280
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,060
It's not, "okay, I know"

1281
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,076
"my two or three
people. Like, they're good.

1282
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,416
"I know they're good
because I know them

1283
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,006
"and I've been with them.

1284
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:50,176
"I need six or seven people
to do what I need them to do

1285
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,820
to move forward in my game."

1286
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:55,440
And, I mean, this
makes it very unreliable.

1287
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,930
It makes it shaky.

1288
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,106
All right. I'm sorry.

1289
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,556
All right, well, I said

1290
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,216
that you will have as much
time to talk as you want.

1291
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,820
I'm ready to vote. Are you all?

1292
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,586
- Good.
- Good. Yeah.

1293
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,866
All right. It is time to vote.

1294
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,796
Sol, you're up.

1295
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,100
I'll go tally the votes.

1296
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,076
If anybody has an advantage or an idol

1297
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,340
and you want to play it, now
would be the time to do so.

1298
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,720
All right, I'll read the votes.

1299
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,000
Sol.

1300
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,860
Sue. One vote sol, one vote sue.

1301
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:56,340
Sol. Two votes sol, one vote sue.

1302
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,790
Sol. That's three votes sol, one vote sue.

1303
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,750
Sol. Four votes sol.

1304
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:15,831
Ninth person voted out and
the second member of our jury:

1305
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,370
Sol.

1306
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,936
That's five. That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

1307
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,286
- Good game, guys.
- Good game, sol.

1308
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,370
- Good luck, everybody.
- Good game, man.

1309
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,310
Sol, the tribe has spoken.

1310
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,370
Time for you to go.

1311
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,696
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

1312
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,750
Good night.
