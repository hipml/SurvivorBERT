00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:15,140
>> Jeff: "SURVIVOR" IS BACK.

2
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:25,775
18 STRANGERS ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,069
CHANGE THEIR LIVES.

4
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,115
THEY'LL BE ABANDONED AND FORCED
TO WORK TOGETHER WHILE VOTING

00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,286
EACH OTHER OUT IN THE GREATEST
SOCIAL EXPERIMENT ON TELEVISION.

35th SEASON OF "SURVIVOR."

00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:25,502
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE BEEN

10
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:29,172
DIVIDED INTO THREE TRIBES BASED
ON THE POSITIVE TRAITS MOST

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,134
ASSOCIATED WITH YOU BY OTHERS.

12
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,345
THIS IS HOW THE WORLD SEES YOU.

13
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:40,350
FIRST GROUP, YOU ARE THE HERO
TRIBE.

14
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,184
[APPLAUSE]
>> I'LL TAKE THAT.

15
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,352
>> I'LL TAKE THAT.

16
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,356
>> Jeff: YOU ARE HERALDED FOR
YOUR COURAGE, YOUR ACHIEVE.

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,691
S, FOR YOUR IDEALS FOR WHICH YOU
STAND.

18
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,360
GUY IN THE COWBOY HAT, WHAT'S
YOUR NAME?

19
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,152
>> BEN.

20
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,196
>> Jeff: DOES THIS RING TRUE
TO YOU?

21
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,155
WHAT IS YOUR WORLD ABOUT?

22
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,866
>> WELL, I HAVE A FAMILY, A WIFE
AND TWO KIDS.

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,828
I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS AND
SERVED OUR COUNTRY.

24
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,331
>> Jeff: SO BEING IN THE ARMED
SERVICES, YOU HAVE TO HAVE HEARD

25
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,708
THE WORD HERO ASSOCIATED WITH
YOU.

26
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,960
>> SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT.

27
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,755
TO US IT'S JUST US DOING OUR JOB
AND FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY.

28
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,841
WE'LL GO OUT AND LAY OUR LIVES
ON THE LINE.

29
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,511
>> Jeff: WHAT ELSE WOULD WE
EXPECT FROM SOMEONE ELSE THAT

30
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,055
SERVES OUR COUNTRY THAN TO SAY,
"IT'S JUST OUR JOB."

31
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,890
>> THAT'S ALL IT IS, JEFF.

32
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,852
>> I DEFINITELY THINK I BELONG
ON THE HERO TRIBE.

33
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,230
>> I FEEL PROUD OF HAVING HAD A
CAREER AND THEN STOPPED AND

34
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,358
STAYED HOME TO TAKE CARE OF MY
KIDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AN

35
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,403
AWESOME CAREER, BUT I NEED THE
REALLY DOWNPLAY THAT BECAUSE I

36
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,531
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK, SHE
ALREADY MAKES A LOT OF MONEY, SO

37
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,033
WE DON'T WANT HER TO WIN A LOT
OF MONEY.

38
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:39,826
>> Jeff: OKAY.

39
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,579
NEXT GROUP, YOU ARE THE HEALER
TRIBE.

40
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:49,210
YOU RECEIVE GRATITUDE FOR YOUR
ACTS OF SERVICE HELPING OTHERS

41
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,255
RELIEVE THEIR PHYSICAL PAIN OR
EMOTIONAL PAIN.

42
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,382
GUY IN THE MIDDLE, WHAT'S YOUR
NAME?

43
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:54,924

44
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,593
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU DO?

45
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,138
>> WE TAKE TEENS INTO THE
OUTDOORS AND TEACH THEM LESSONS

46
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,931
LIKE MAKING FIRE AND SURVIVAL
SKILLS.

47
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,600
THE OUTDOORS OPENED UP MY WORLD.

48
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,604
I WANT TO OPEN UP OTHER PEOPLE'S
WORLDS WITH THE SAME THING THAT

49
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,771
MADE MINE SO AMAZING.

50
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,482
>> Jeff: GUY HERE IN THE FRONT
WITH THE GLASSES, WHAT'S YOUR

51
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:11,774
NAME?

52
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,358
>> MIKE.

53
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,610

I'M A UROLOGIST AND I SPECIALIZE

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,826
INFERTILITY.

57
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,620
>> Jeff: YOU RECEIVE A LOT OF
GRATITUDE FROM GUYS ALL THE TIME

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,288
IN
>> MOST GUYS ARE PRETTY HAPPY

59
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,956
WHEN THEY'RE THROUGH WITH ME.

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,918
WINNING "SURVIVOR" IS THE
BIGGEST DREAM IN MY LIFE.

61
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,796
MY WIFE THINKS I'M CRAZY FOR
DOING THIS, MY KIDS THINK I'M

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,633
GOING TO DIE, BUT I'M GOING TO
RISE TO THE OCCASION AND WIN.

63
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,342
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

64
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,801
THAT BRINGS US TO OUR LAST
GROUP.

65
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,637
YOU ARE THE HUSTLER TRIBE.

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,640
YOU ARE RESPECTED FOR YOUR HARD
WORK ETHIC.

67
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:49,145
YOUR MANTRA IS GET IT DONE NO
MATTER WHAT, 100% ALL THE TIME.

68
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,772
WOMAN IN THE MIDDLE, WHAT'S YOUR
NAME?

69
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,981

70
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,191
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU DO?

71
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,984
>> I'M A PERSONAL ASSISTANT.

72
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:00,365
I WORK FOR SOMEONE AT YOUTUBE,
DAILY DISK DUTIES.

73
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,493
SOMETIMES I DO HER MAKE-UP IF
SHE DOESN'T HAVE MAKE-UP ARTIST.

74
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,663
I COOK FOR HER IF SHE DOESN'T
HAVE A COOK.

75
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,914
I FILL IN THE GAPS.

76
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,959
I WAKE UP THAT DAY AND FIND OUT
WHAT I HAVE TO DO, AND I DO IT.

77
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,629
>> DREW: BEING PART OF A GROUP
THAT'S RESPECTED FOR WORK ETHICS

78
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,380
RINGS VERY TRUE TO YOU?

79
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,547
>> OH, YEAH.

80
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,050
>> JUST LOOKING AT OUR TRIBE, I
THINK IT'S A STRONG GROUP.

81
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,303
I HOPE THEY'RE MACHO ENOUGH AND
THEY KNOW HOW THE BUILD A

82
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,513
SHELTER AND CRACK A CONUT.

83
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,682
I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THEM.

84
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,266
I'M 125 POUNDS SOAKING WET.

85
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,310
I DON'T DRINK AND I DON'T HAVE A
GIRLFRIEND.

86
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,728
WHO WANTS TO ALIGN WITH ME?

87
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,354
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

88
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,605
WE HAVE THREE GOOD GROUPS.

89
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:38,528
THIS SEASON IS CALLED "SURVIVOR:
HEROES V. HEALERS V. HUSTLERS."

90
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,699
LET ME GIVE YOU YOUR BUFFS.

91
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,201
>> IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS.

92
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,203
>> BLUE.

93
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,540
>> Jeff: THIS IS YOUR FIRST
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE YOUR VALUE

94
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,501
TO YOUR TRIBE.

95
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,837
THIS BOAT IS LOADED WITH
SUPPLIES.

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,841
YOUR JOB IS TO GET AS MANY OF
THE SUPPLIES FROM THIS BOAT TO

97
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,552
YOUR BOAT.

98
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:07,348
IN ADDITION, THERE'S AN EVEN
BIGGER REWARD AT STAKE.

99
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:13,563
ON THE BEACH, EACH TRIBE HAS A
BURNING URN 15 FEET HIGH.

100
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,567
WHEN YOU HEAR MEHRING THIS BELL,
THAT'S YOUR CUE TO GET ALL SIX

101
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,194
TRIBE MEMBERS ON THE BOAT AND
START PADDLING TO SHORE.

102
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,407
WHEN YOU GET TO SHORE, YOU MUST
LIFT ONE PERSON HIGH ENOUGH TO

103
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,908
LIGHT THEIR TORCH.

104
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:31,581
FIRST TRIBE TO GET FIRE WINS
FIRE IN THE FORM OF A MASSIVE

105
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,710
FIRE-MAKING KIT THAT WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

THE LAST TRIBE TO FINISH,
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE LOSERS,

110
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,262
WILL GO BACK TO CAMP WITH NO
FIRE.

111
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:53,102
THIS IS DAY ONE OF A 39-DAY, $1
MILLION ADVENTURE, AND IT BEGINS

00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:54,729
"SURVIVOR" IS ON.

114
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,396
LET'S GO!

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,939

116
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,732
>> I CAN.

117
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,067
>> LET'S DO THIS!

118
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,111
>>

119
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,448
THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR, AND IT'S HAPPENING

120
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:05,698
RIGHT NOW.

121
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,449

122
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,618

>> OH, MY GOD.

124
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,122
>> Jeff: OUT OF THE GATE IT IS
CHAOS.

125
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,584
PEOPLE ALREADY GOING OVERBOARD
WITH LOTS OF SUPPLIES LEFT ON

126
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,294
THE BOAT.

127
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,130
SO FAR THERE IS NO PLAN AT ALL.

128
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,799
>> LET'S GO, GUYS.

129
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,344
>> Jeff: WOW, PEOPLE LAUNCHING
STUFF, PATRICK LAUNCHING FRUIT

130
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,929
LIKE A QUARTERBACK WITH NO
RECEIVER.

131
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,138
>> LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

132
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,473
>> Jeff: 30 SECONDS.

133
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,642
REMEMBER, WHEN I HIT THAT BELL,
YOU CAN HEAD OUT.

134
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,601
>> LET'S GO, GUYS.

135
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,354
>> I SEE SOMETHING LABELED
SECRET ADVANTAGE.

136
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,939
I AM SUPER EXCITED.

137
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,148
MY HANDS ARE TREMBLING.

138
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,651
I WAS LIKE, WHOO.

139
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,152
>> Jeff: LOTS OF FRUIT IN THE
WATER.

140
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,031
NOW IT BECOMES GETTING IT TO
YOUR BOAT.

141
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,158
>> A LITTLE BIT MORE.

142
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,868
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY OVER.

143
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,954
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW.

144
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:53,496
LET'S GO, DUDE.

145
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,163
GET OVER!

146
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,165
THAT MEANS NOW.

147
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,334
GET IN YOUR BOAT AND START
HEADING TO THE BEACH.

148
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,212
>> GET IN, GET IN.

149
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,339
>> Jeff: NOW IT'S FIRST TO GET
FIRE.

150
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,424

151
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,804
>> GO!

152
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,807
>> Jeff: THE HUSTLER TRIBE IS
STRUGGLING TO EVEN GET IN THEIR

153
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,184
BOAT.

154
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,979
HEALERS REALLY WORKING TOGETHER
WELL.

155
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,731
HEROES RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL.

156
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,192
AND THE HUSTLER TRIBE POINTING
THE WRONG WAY.

157
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,402
THEY'RE HEADING TO A DIFFERENT
BEACH.

158
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,195
>> WHICH WAY ARE WE GOING, GUYS?

159
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,364
>> SPIN IT RIGHT.

160
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,032
>> LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

161
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,034
>> Jeff: HEALERS GOING TO GET
TO THE BEACH FIRST.

162
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:38,207
THEN THE HEROES WITH THE
HUSTLERS LITERALLY LOST AT SEA.

163
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,376
>> COME ON, COME ON.

164
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,544
SOMEONE JUMP OUT AND HELP ME.

165
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,212
>> Jeff: HEALERS GET HERE
FIRST.

166
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,547
YOU GOT TO HOOK THAT BOAT.

167
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,548
HERE COMES THE HERO TRIBE.

168
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,924
>> LET'S GO, GUYS.

169
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,800
COME ON.

170
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,093
>> DREW: WE ARE NECK AND NECK
RIGHT NOW.

171
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,136
BOTH TRIBES VERY EVEN.

172
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:50,720
YOU'RE GOOD.

173
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,346
START UNTYING YOUR TORCH.

174
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,932
YOU'RE GOOD, HERO TRIBE.

175
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,142
START UNTYING YOUR TORCH.

176
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,059
>> COME ON.

177
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,894
>> Jeff: OKAY.

178
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,563
PAUL HAS THE TORCH FOR THE
HEALER TRIBE.

179
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,064
>> YOU'RE THE LIGHTEST.

180
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:02,398
YOU'RE THE LIGHTEST.

181
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,524
>> NO WAY.

182
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,569
>> Jeff: YOU GOT TO GET
SOMEBODY HIGH ENOUGH TO GET THAT

183
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,445
FIRE.

184
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,238
>> YOU HOLD THE TORCH, YOU HOLD
THE TORCH.

185
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,409
>> Jeff: THIS IS GOING TO COME
DOWN TO A VERY CLOSE FINISH.

186
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:14,577
HEALERS THERE.

187
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,913
HEALERS CLOSE.

188
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,413
YES!

189
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,916
YOU GOT IT.

190
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,545
HEALERS GET FIRE FIRE IN A
MASSIVE FIRE REWARD.

191
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,713
HEROES HAVE IT.

192
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:30,593
IT IS HEALERS AND HEROES WITH
THE HUSTLERS STILL TRYING TO

193
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:36,891
FIGURE OUT WHAT SHOW THEY'RE ON.

194
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:37,975
ALL RIGHT.

195
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,062
HEALER TRIBE, YOU WILL HAVE
WAITING FOR YOU AT CAMP A

196
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,940
MASSIVE FIRE-MAKING KIT, AND YOU
WILL KNOW YOU'RE AT YOUR BEACH

197
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,942
WHEN YOU SEE THE FIRE ALREADY
BURNING.

198
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,028
NICE JOB.

199
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,447
[APPLAUSE]
HERO TRIBE, FLINT, YOU CAN MAKE

200
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,452
FIRE WITH THIS.

201
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,203
ALL RIGHT.

202
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,456
EACH TRIBE HAS A MAP IN YOUR
BOAT.

203
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:05,920
GET IN YOUR BOAT, START PADDLING
AND GOOD LUCK.

204
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,632
>> COMING FROM THAT HORRIBLE
COMPETITION, I WAS JUST PRETTY

205
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,841
PISSED.

206
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,636
I'M HOPING THAT OUR WORK ETHIC
AND OUR STRENGTH ALONE CAN PUSH

207
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,973
US TO COME TOGETHER AND GET IT
DONE, BUT AT THIS POINT I'M VERY

208
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,310
NERVOUS.

209
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,792
>> AS WE ROW IN, WE SEE THE
BIGGEST FIRE ANY OF US HAVE EVER

210
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,128
SEEN.

211
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,463
AND IT SETS US OFF ON THE RIGHT
FOOT.

212
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,631
>> I'M SO PROUD OF US.

213
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,465
>> I KNOW.

214
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,675
WAY TO GO, TEAM.

215
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:57,346
>> HEALERS ARE DEFINITELY A
TEAM-BASED GROUP IN TERMS OF HOW

216
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,349
WE APPROACH OUR CAREERS, IN
TERMS OF HOW WE APPROACH OUR

217
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,852
LIVES, AND I THINK THAT'S A
REALLY DISTINCT DIFFERENCE

218
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,730
BETWEEN US AND THE OTHER TWO.

219
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:11,193
>> I'M LITERALLY WITH THE THREE
FEMALES.

220
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,362
THERE'S A GROUP STRENGTH, RIGHT?

221
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,364
AND YOU, YOU GOT THE EIGHT PACK.

222
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,825
>> COLE IS TARZAN, I LIKE HIM A
LOT.

223
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,826
HE'S FUN.

224
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,579
HE'S TRYING NOT TO BE THE TOUGH
GUY, BUT HE IS.

225
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,373
I MEAN, HE'S RIPPED.

226
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,377
HE HAS BEAUTIFUL, TAN SKIN,
BLONDE HAIR, BLUE EYES.

227
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,545
I THINK I'M IN LOVE.

228
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:35,384
>> I'M SO GLAD WE HAVE THIS
TRIBE.

229
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,388
EVEN IF WE HAVE AN OFF DAY,
WE'RE STILL SAFE.

230
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,598
>> I JUST DON'T SEE IT.

231
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,225
IT'S ALL ABOUT COMMUNICATION.

232
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,185
IT'S ABOUT COMMUNICATION.

233
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,228
THAT'S WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING.

234
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,438
>> YEAH.

235
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,732
>> I WANTED TO BE IN THE TRIBE
THEY COULD EASILY MANIPULATE,

236
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,610
AND I FEEL THAT WHEN YOU'RE A
HEALER, YOU HAVE A BIG HEART,

237
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,071
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A BIG HEART,
YOU DON'T THINK WITH YOUR MIND,

238
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,322
YOU THINK WITH YOUR HEART.

239
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,949
I'M A HEALER IN THE FACT THAT MY
MAIN JOB IS REHABILITATION, BUT

240
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,703
I'M NOT A FROM BASE OFFICER WHEN
I'M OUT HERE.

241
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,746
I CAME OUT HERE TO WIN.

242
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,582
I'M PROBABLY MORE STRATEGIC THAN
EVERYONE ALTOGETHER.

243
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:17,259
SO THEY'RE ALL MY VICTIMS AT
THIS POINT.

244
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,719
>> WHEW.

245
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,764
>> BIG PIECE ON THE BOTTOM,
LITTLE PIECE ON TOP.

246
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,765
>> LET'S GO.

247
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,766
>> YEAH?

248
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,768
>> NOW WE'RE HAPPENING.

249
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,187
>> NEED HELP WITH THAT?

250
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,607
THE QUALITIES OF BEING A HERO
ARE GOING TO HELP IN "SURVIVOR,"

251
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,193
BECAUSE THE WHOLE IDEA OF BEING
A HERO, YOU'RE PUTTING OTHERS

252
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,862
BEFORE YOURSELF, WHICH MAKES FOR
A REALLY STRONG TRIBE.

253
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,114
WHAT ABOUT FIREWOOD?

254
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,740
BUT GAME ON.

255
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,494
THE HERO CAPE FALLS OFF AND
AUTOMATICALLY YOU'RE THINKING

256
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,121
ALLIANCES, CONVERSATIONS NEED TO
HAPPEN.

257
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,791
SO IT WILL DEFINITELY START TO
GET INTERESTING.

258
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

259
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,670
>> I LIKE COWBOY.

260
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,129
>> WHAT'S UP?

261
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,505
>> I LIKE COWBOY?

262
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,801
>> YEAH, ME, YOU, COWBOY?

263
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,802
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD?

264
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,846
>> HE'S SMART AND USEFUL.

265
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,973
>> I THINK WE CAN MAKE THAT
WORK.

266
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,809
>> I PLAYED IN THE N.F.L. FOR
NINE YEARS, AND AFTER YOU PLAY

267
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,645
FOR A WHILE, YOU CAN SEE WHO IS
A TEMPO SETTER.

268
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,314
JUST NOW, I GOT A SENSE OF HOW
PEOPLE ARE PLAYING THE GAME.

269
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,316
>> WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT
MORE.

270
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,654
>> I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO PLAY
THE GAME, WHICH FOR ME IS FULL

271
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,989
TILT SPRINT OUT THE GATE.

272
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,824
WHO ARE YOU THINKING OF WORKING
WITH?

273
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,491
WE NEED TO WIN CHALLENGES.

274
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,159
WE NEED STRENGTH.

275
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,034
>> ABSOLUTELY.

276
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:24,702
WE HAVE TO WIN.

277
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:30,499
>> WE NEED STRENGTH.

278
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,375
J.T. IS AN ASSET.

279
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,129
YOU AND ASHLEY, THAT'S FOUR
RIGHT THERE.

280
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,630
WE'RE GOING TO EXPLODE ON THAT.

281
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,673
>> OKAY.

282
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,675
>> I WORK WITH SO MANY
FIREFIGHTERS AND SOON-TO-BE

283
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,509
FIREFIGHTERS.

284
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,386
YOU REMIND ME SO MUCH OF ALL OF
THEM.

285
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,138
>> OH, YEAH?

286
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,682
>> THEY MUST BE PRETTY COOL
GUYS.

287
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,600
>> THEY'RE ALL MY BEST FRIENDS.

288
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,019
>> I'VE BEEN WATCHING THOSE TWO
FOR A WHILE.

289
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,063
I HONESTLY THINK ASHLEY AND
J.P.M. ARE WORKING TOGETHER, SO

290
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,400
I WANT THE MAKE THEM BELIEVE
I'LL WORK WITH THEM, BUT THIS

291
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,321
POWER COUPLE OR WHATEVER THEY
GOT GOING ON IS OVER.

292
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,947
>> THEY'RE GOING TO GO GET
WATER.

293
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,157
>> NICE.

294
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,785
>> HEY, Y'ALL, FOUR, RIGHT?

295
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,537
>> YEAH.

296
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,371
YEAH.

297
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,664
>> I WANTED US FOUR FROM THE
BEGINNING.

298
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:16,003
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A
CORE FOUR, AND THAT'S ME, ALAN,

299
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,838
ASHLEY, AND J.P.

300
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:22,051
WE'RE ALL YOUNGER, WE'RE FIT,
AND THEN WE GOT THE TWO MOMS,

301
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,093
CHRISSY AND KATRINA.

302
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,178
>> THE WHOLE YOUNG CROWD.

303
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,221
>> IT IS.

304
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,097
>> IF YOU AND I DON'T WORK
TOGETHER AT SOME LEVEL...

305
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,933
>> NO, NO, WE HAVE TO.

306
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,893
>> WE'VE LABELED THEM THE MOM
SQUAD.

307
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,228
THAT'S AN EASY TARGET AT THIS
POINT.

308
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,730
>> KEEP IT STRONG.

309
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,397
THAT'S IT.

310
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,607
WE'RE DONE.

311
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,776
WINNING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING RIGHT NOW FOR THIS TRIBE.

312
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,402
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

313
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:53,749
>> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, WE
HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

314
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,251
>> CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION?

315
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,460
>> YEAH.

316
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,671
>> WE NEED TO BE OVER HERE, AWAY
FROM THIS OVER HERE, BECAUSE,

317
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:03,634
YOU KNOW, THERE'S CRITTERS AND
SPIDERS AND SNAKES.

318
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,970
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED WE DIDN'T
WIN THE CHALLENGE, BUT AT THE

319
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,098
SAME TIME, LET'S NOT GIVE UP.

320
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,308
>> GET IT IN THERE, BABY.

321
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,770
>> BEING HUSTLER, WE'RE HARD
WORKERS, SO WE KIND OF KICK IT

322
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,771
IN GEAR.

323
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,814
I LIKE IT.

324
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,942
>> THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO
THE REST OF THIS GAME.

325
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,777
REALLY IF WE PLAY AS A TEAM,
WE'LL BE FINE.

326
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,321
IF NOT WE'RE GOING TO BE
SCREWED.

327
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,447
>> THAT'S A WALKING STICK.

328
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,615
>> SHOULD I EAT IT?

329
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,116
>> NO.

330
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,242
>> YOU DON'T THINK SO?

331
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,493
>> NO.

332
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:34,623
>> MY PRIORITIES FOR DAY ONE ARE
TO MAKE SURE THAT I CONNECT WITH

333
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,459
PEOPLE, AND PATRICK SEEMS LIKE
HE'S MESHING WELL WITH THE GROUP

334
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,504
JUST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, SO
I KIND OF WANT THE SEE WHERE HIS

335
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,967
HEAD IS AT.

336
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,595
>> I FORGOT I HAVE A CRAB IN MY
PANTS.

337
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,848
>> I KNOW IF WE NEVER LOSE, WE
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AN

338
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,017
ALLIANCE, BUT THE WAY WE LOOKED
IN THE FIRST CHALLENGE, WE

339
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,186
SHOULD PROBABLY START TALKING
NOW.

340
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,438
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT?

341
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,315
>> I FEEL WE HAVE A GOOD TEAM.

342
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:04,528
WE'VE GOT TO WIN FIRST TRIBAL,
THOUGH.

343
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,821
DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE A GAME
PLAN.

344
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:10,117
>> YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO HAVE THE
MIND SET, BUT I GOT YOUR BACK IF

345
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,618
YOU GOT MINE.

346
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,287
>> I GOT YOUR BACK.

347
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,538
ALI, SHE'S A VERY SMART GIRL.

348
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,292
ON AN ISLAND WHERE WE CAN TRUST
NO ONE, I FEEL I CAN TRUST HER,

349
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,004
BUT IT'S "SURVIVOR," SO YOU
CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE.

350
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,881
I FEEL GOOD, BUT I'M NOT
CERTAIN.

351
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,216
>> NOW I'M WONDERING WHO GOT THE
CLUE ON THE BOAT.

352
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,676
>> YOU THINK SOMEONE FOUND
SOMETHING?

353
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,970
>> IF NOT, SOMEBODY OVERLOOKED
IT.

354
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:30,763
IT WAS ON THERE.

355
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,222
>> I FOUND AN ADVANTAGE ON THE
BOAT.

356
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,015
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT.

357
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,391
IT'S IN MY PANTS.

358
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,393
I'M DYING TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.

359
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,397
FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE IS
DYING TO GET IN MY PANTS.

360
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,150
I KIND OF JUST WAIT FOR THE
PERFECT MOMENT TO GET AWAY.

361
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,860
I GO INTO THE JUNGLE BY MYSELF.

362
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,195
I AM SUPER EXCITED.

363
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,405
I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

364
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,490
I'M A HUSTLER.

365
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,868
HUSTLERS DON'T GET ADVANTAGES,
AND THE HUSTLER GOT AN

366
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:53,744
ADVANTAGE.

367
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,704
>> YOU HAVE FOUND AN IMMUNITY
SUPERIDOL.

368
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,582
IT CAN BE PLAYED AFTER THE VOTES
HAVE BEEN READ AND WILL SAVE

369
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,542
WHOEVER YOU PLAY IT FOR.

370
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,418
OH, MY GOD.

371
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,045
THIS COULD BE MY POWER TO WIN
THIS GAME.

372
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,255
I HAVE A SUPER IMMUNITY IDOL.

373
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,550
THAT COULD BE USED AFTER THE
VOTES HAVE BEEN READ.

374
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,387
THAT GIVES YOU SO MUCH POWER.

375
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,304
A TWIST.

376
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,472
IT'S ONLY GOOD AT THE FIRST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

377
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,600
IF YOUR TRIBE WINS IMMUNITY,
THAT MEANS YOU WILL NOT GO TO

378
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,185
THE FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

379
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,271
YOU MUST SEND SOMEBODY TO THE
LOSING TRIBE.

380
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,940
THE RECIPIENT WILL NOT KNOW WHO
SENT IT.

381
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,276
>> IF WE PULL OUT A WIN, I HAVE
TO GIVE IT TO A MEMBER OF THE

382
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,112
LOSING TRIBE THAT GOES TO
TRIBAL.

383
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,573
THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE THE MOST
POWER RIGHT NOW IN THIS GAME,

384
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,700
AND NOBODY ELSE HAS ANY CLUE
WHATSOEVER.

385
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:48,716
>> OKAY.

386
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,925
I'M READY FOR MARCHING ORDERS.

387
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,468
>> LEST GATHER SOME MORE BAMBOO
SO WE HAVE EVERYTHING HERE.

388
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,594
>> THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

389
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,430
THE SHELTER WILL GO OVER HERE I
THINK.

390
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,599
>> I'M FORTUNATE TO BE PART OF
THE HEALER TRIBE.

391
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,851
WE'RE IN HIGH SPIRITS.

392
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,478
WE KNOW THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST
WE CAN COMMUNICATE, AND AS LONG

393
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:06,942
AS WE DO THAT IN CAMP LIFE,
EVERYTHING RUNS SMOOTHLY.

394
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,277
HOLY CRAP, NICE.

395
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,153
>> I KNOW.

396
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,780
>> MY SON TOLD ME TO LOOK FOR
THE IDOL.

397
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,450
HE'S TEN YEARS OLD, AND HE
WATCHES SURVIVOR.

398
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,454
IF MY TEN-YEAR-OLD SON KNOWS TO
LOOK FOR THE IDOL, I SHOULD GO

399
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,122
LOOKING FOR IT, AND SO SHOULD
EVERYBODY ELSE.

400
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:25,794
>> I THINK THE ONLY CONCERN IS
BEING THIS CLOSE TO MOSQUITOES.

401
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,129
>> SHOULD WE CHECK THE FIRE?

402
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,380
>> I'LL GO CHECK IT.

403
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,718
>>MY BIGGEST FEAR GOING INTO THI
GAME IS BEING VOTED OUT FIRST.

404
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,763
I LEFT MY KIDS AND MY WIFE
BEHIND TO PLAY THIS CRAZY GAME,

405
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,348
BUT I DID NOT COME OUT HERE FOR
AN ADVENTURE.

406
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:42,770
I AM OUT HERE TO WIN $1 MILLION
AND BE THE BEST "SURVIVOR"

407
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,854
PLAYER EVER.

408
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,024
SO I AM WILLING TO DO WHAT IT
TAKES TO WIN THIS GAME.

409
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,735
>> NICE.

410
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,322
>> WHEN MIKE COMES BACK, I'M
GOING TO ASK HIM TO DRAW US MAP

411
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,325
OF THE ISLAND, BECAUSE HE KNOWS
IT LIKE THE BACK OF HIS HAND,

412
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:56,992
LIKE LEGIT.

413
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,285
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

414
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,330
>> MIKE IS DEFINITELY A PLAYER,
AND I'M A TAD BIT CONCERNED THAT

415
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,165
HE'S RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO
FIND THE IDOL.

416
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,168
SO I THINK HE WANTED TO LOOK FOR
THE IDOL.

417
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,004
NOW HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE NO
M.

418
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,631
>> HE'S GETTING FIREWOOD.

419
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:15,010
>> I HAVE A GREAT LIE DETECTOR,
AND I'M THINKING MIKE IS NOT A

420
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:19,848
TRUSTWORTHY GUY.

421
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:24,311
>> WE UNDID THE BAD WITH THE
BANDANNAS ON THE OTHER SIDE,

422
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,229
TOO.

423
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,898
>> MIKE'S SUSPECT RUNNING AROUND
THIS ISLAND.

424
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,859
I PERSONALLY THINK HE HAS THE
IDOL.

425
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,694
>> I WISH I DID, THAT WOULD BE
AWESOME.

426
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,030
>> SO YOU LOOKED THROUGH THIS
WHOLE ISLAND AND YOU DIDN'T FIND

427
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,073
NOTHING?

428
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,867
>> I HAVEN'T LOOKED THROUGH THE
WHOLE ISLAND YET.

429
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,369
>> WE BOTH WATCH THE GAME.

430
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,871
>> I'M HONORED THAT YOU THINK
I'M A HUSTLER.

431
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,209
>> NO, NO, NO, THE THING IS I
RESPECT YOU ENOUGH TO COME SEE

432
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,377
YOU INDIVIDUALLY RIGHT OR WRONG.

433
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:48,836
>> THAT'S NICE.

434
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,379
>> I RESPECT THAT.

435
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,882
HOPEFULLY YOU RESPECT ME, AS
WELL, THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

436
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,717
>> I DO RESPECT YOU.

437
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,887
I DON'T TRUST JOE FOR ONE
SECOND.

438
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,850
HE'S PULLED ME ASIDE TO HAVE A
MAN-TO-MAN TALK WITH ME TO

439
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:08,063
ESSENTIALLY BULLY ME INTO
TELLING HIM THAT I WENT LOOKING

440
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,064
FOR THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

441
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:12,067
>> I WANTED YOU TO BE AWARE THAT
WE ARE ALL AWARE.

442
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,985
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

443
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,572
>> BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT PUTS
ME AT RISK.

444
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,199
PERCEPTION IS 90% OF REALITY,
UNFORTUNATELY.

445
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:27,875
AND WITH THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO
BE HAVING TO FIGHT PERCEPTIONS.

446
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,960
>> OH, MY GOD.

447
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,712
>> THIS IS SO LIGHT RIGHT NOW.

448
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,089
I DON'T KNOW WHO GOT ALL THE
WEIGHT, BUT IT'S NOT ME.

449
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,257
>> I FEEL LIKE IT'S ME.

450
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,761
>> THREE, TWO, ONE, DROP... GOOD
WORK.

451
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,098
THESE FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE
CRUCIAL, AND I REALLY LIKE

452
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,100
HAVING DEVON IN THIS GROUP
BECAUSE HE'S DIFFERENT THAN ME.

453
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,728
>> DEVON, WHAT DO YOU DO AGAIN?

454
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:52,482
>> TEACH KIDS HOW TO SURF.

455
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,735
I DON'T MAKE A LOT, BUT IT PAYS
MY RENT.

456
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:58,655
>> HE SEEMS LIKE A GUY WHO IS
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO IS MORE

457
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,907
STRATEGICALLY SOUND.

458
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,825
SO I'M WAITING FOR THE PERFECT
MOMENT WHEN EVERYBODY IS CLEARED

459
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,578
OUT OF CAMP SO I CAN BUILD A
CONNECTION.

460
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,829
SO I FOUND AN ADVANTAGE
YESTERDAY.

461
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,622
>> YOU DID?

462
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,624
>> ON THE BOAT, YEAH.

463
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,708
ONLY FOR THE FIRST TRIBAL.

464
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:14,129
I HAVE THE IDOL THAT COULD BE
PLAYED AFTER THE VOTES.

465
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:14,546
YEAH.

466
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,797
AND THAT'S IT.

467
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,092
AND IF WE DON'T GO TO TRIBAL, I
HAVE TO GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE

468
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:19,384
ON THEIR TRIBE.

469
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,886
>> OKAY.

470
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,221
I'M SO HAPPY, DUDE.

471
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,641
DUDE, I WAS SO SCARED TO BE
FIRST ONE.

472
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,142
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE FIRST
ONE.

473
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,310
>> NO, NO.

474
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,314
>> RYAN TELLS ME ABOUT THIS
SPECIAL IMMUNITY IDOL AND SAID

475
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,483
HE WILL BE WILLING TO USE THE
IDOL FOR ME.

476
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,945
RYAN AND I HAVE THE SAME
MINDSET, SAME IDEAS, OUR

477
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:38,737
CHEMISTRY IS PERFECT.

478
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,197
WE'RE GOING TO CAUSE CHAOS
TOGETHER.

479
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,324
>> I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE ELSE
AND I'M NOT.

480
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,661
>> KEEP IT, KEEP IT.

481
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,120
>> THAT'S HOW MUCH I TRUST YOU.

482
00:20:47,204 --> 00:21:00,884
>> COOL.

483
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,511
>> SHE WAS ABOUT TO HIT ME.

484
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,178
DID YOU SEE THAT?

485
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,012
>> I DID.

486
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,348
IF YOU WERE CLOSER I WOULD HAVE
HIT YOU

487
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,933
YOU WERE JUST TOO FAR AWAY.

488
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,184
>> IT'S NOT FIRST TIME?

489
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:13,855
>> FIRST TIME WHAT, FOR US TO
FIGHT?

490
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,483
>> I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON BETWEEN J.P. AND

491
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,526
ASHLEY.

492
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,361
IT'S RED FLAGS ALL OVER THE
PLACE BETWEEN THOSE TWO.

493
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,698
I NEED TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW
THOSE TWO ARE STRONGER TOGETHER

494
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,201
RIGHT NOW THAN QUESTION ARE ALL
AS INDIVIDUALS.

495
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,870
>> YO, YOU GOT THE IDOL.

496
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,871
IT'S COOL IF HE GOT IT.

497
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,750
>> I DON'T HAVE THE IDOL, 100%.

498
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:39,548
>> HOW FAR ARE YOU WILLING TO GO
TO MOVE -- TO PROVE THAT?

499
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,382
LET'S GO TO THE SWIM.

500
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,094
LET'S GO TO THE WATER'S EDGE
RIGHT NOW.

501
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,762
>> I SWEAR ON MY MOM'S GRAVE.

502
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,514
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

503
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,391
>> MAN'S HANDSHAKE.

504
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,559
>> I DON'T NEED THAT.

505
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,060
JUST PUT YOUR HANDS UP.

506
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:52,894
>> I SWEAR THE GOD.

507
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,230
>> I KNOW WHERE THE IDOL IS
RIGHT NOW.

508
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:57,024
I KNOW WHERE IT'S AT RIGHT NOW.

509
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,400
I JUST KIND OF KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON.

510
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,901
>> TRUST ME, I PROMISE.

511
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,030
>> WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY, I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

512
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,364
>> ARE WE FOUR STRONG OR NOT?

513
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,033
>> I THOUGHT SO.

514
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,577
YOU ARE TRIPPING LIKE YOU'RE
TRIPPING, TRIPPING.

515
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,079
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE AN
IDOL.

516
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,414
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE ANYTHING.

517
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,540
I JUST THREW IT OUT THERE.

518
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:17,377
I KNOW I LOOK LIKE THE CRAZY
MAN, BUT NOW I GOT SUSPICION

519
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,756
GOING, AND I JUST PUT TARGET ON
THEIR BACK IF IT WORKED THE WAY

520
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,923
IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK.

521
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,134
>> YOU'RE INSINUATING THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THAT

522
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,595
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT, AND
THERE'S NOT.

523
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,972
>> NOTHING GOING ON THAT I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT?

524
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:29,473
>> NO.

525
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,599
>> WILL IS NO IDOL?

526
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,933
>> THERE IS NO IDOL.

527
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,102
>> ALAN IS A CRAZY MAN.

528
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,773
HE GETS THIS CRAZY LOOK IN HIS
EYE AND IT'S HIS DRAMA AND

529
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,568
EVERYTHING HE CAUSES IS I THINK
MAYBE NOT WORTH HIS STRENGTH.

530
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,112
JUST A LOOSE CANNON LIKE THAT
ROCKS THE SHIP.

531
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,822
>> ARE WE FOUR STRONG?

532
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,698
>> YES.

533
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,949
>> DUDE, YOU'RE TRIPPING HARD
RIGHT NOW.

534
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,328
>> I KNOW, I KNOW, BECAUSE IT
LOOKS LIKE I'M TRIPPING, RIGHT?

535
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,329
>> YEAH.

536
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,415
>> SO THE IDOL IN YOUR PANTS I'M
TRIPPING ABOUT?

537
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,085
>> IF HE HAS AN IDOL, I KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT IT.

538
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:03,340
>> DON'T TURN AROUND, WHY ARE
YOU TURNING AROUND?

539
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,176
I KNOW YOU GOT THE IDOL, MY MAN?

540
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,010
WHERE IS IT AT?

541
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,430
>> ALAN IS STARTING TO LOSE HIS
MIND.

542
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,976
HE MADE J.P. STRIP TO CHECK HIS
PANTS FOR AN IDOL, SO MY MIND IS

543
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,186
LITERALLY BLOWN RIGHT NOW.

544
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,189
HIS PARANOIA IS SO BAD, LIKE
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM ALL OF

545
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:23,151
A SUDDEN, BECAUSE I TRUSTED HIM
AND I THOUGHT HE TRUSTED ME, BUT

546
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,319
JUST LIKE THAT, TRUST IS
TOURNAMENT WINDOW.

547
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,072
SO MOVING FORWARD WITH HIM SEEMS
LIKE IT COULD BE A LIABILITY

548
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,156
DOWN THE ROAD.

549
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:57,853
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

550
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,020
ALL RIGHT.

551
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:04,484
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR
FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

552
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,527
[APPLAUSE]
>> YEAH.

553
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,320
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'RE GOING THE RACE

554
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,490
UP A CARGO NET TO THE TOP OF A
TOWER.

555
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:16,204
YOU'LL THEN PULL A HEAVY CART
UP, HOP IN, AND CAREEN DOWN TO

556
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:21,501
THE BOTTOM WHERE YOU WILL FIND A
CHOICE OF THREE "SURVIVOR" TABLE

557
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,377
MAZES.

558
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,545
THE FIRST TRIBE HERE GETS FIRST
CHOICE.

559
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,215
SECOND TRIBE TO ARRIVE GETS TO
CHOOSE BETWEEN THE REMAINING

560
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:27,883
TWO.

561
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,093
THE LAST TRIBE GETS WHAT'S LEFT.

562
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,930
YOU'LL THEN WORK TOGETHER TO GET
THAT MAZE TO THE TOP OF AN EVEN

563
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,267
TALLER TOWER, WHERE TWO PLAYERS
WILL MANEUVER THREE BALLS

564
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,977
THROUGH THE MAZE.

565
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,899
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
IMMUNITY.

566
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:48,028
THESE ARE THE IMMUNITY IDOLS.

567
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,196
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.

568
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,948
WITH ONE OF THESE IN YOUR
POSSESSION, YOU ARE SAFE IN THIS

569
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:55,202
GAME.

570
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,662
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIRST

571
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,872
PERSON VOTED OUT.

572
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,416
IN ADDITION, HUSTLERS, YOU ARE
STILL PLAYING FOR FIRE IN THE

573
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,584
FORM OF FLINT.

574
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,214
ONE MORE THING, AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL THIS SEASON, TIE VOTES

575
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,215
ARE BACK IN.

576
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,758
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

577
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,634
WE'LL GET STARTED.

578
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:16,097
LET'S DO IT.

579
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:16,598
ALL RIGHT.

580
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,641
HERE WE GO.

581
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:21,728
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?

582
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,730
GO!

583
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,233
YOU GOT TO GET UP THAT CARGO
NET.

584
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:33,907
ATTACK IT.

585
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,745
HEROES FIRST ON THEIR PART, THEN
THE HEALERS, THEN THE HUSTLERS.

586
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,121
THOSE CARTS ARE HEAVY.

587
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,457
THIS IS WHERE ADRENALINE IS YOUR
FRIEND.

588
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,836
IT GIVES YOU STRENGTH YOU DIDN'T
KNOW YOU HAD.

589
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,131
HEALERS GET TO THE TOP FIRST,
THEN THE HEROES, THEN THE

590
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:50,757
HUSTLERS.

591
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,760
ONCE YOU'RE IN, RELEASE IT.

592
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,886
>> GO, GO.

593
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,847
>> Jeff: HUSTLERS GET OUT
FIRST, THEN THE HERO, THEN THE

594
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,309
HEALERS.

595
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,310
THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT.

596
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,481
>> COME ON, COME ON, EVERYBODY.

597
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,816
>> Jeff: HEROES HERE FIRST.

598
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,527
YOU HAVE FIRST CHOICE.

599
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,611
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

600
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,529
THEY CHOOSE THREE.

601
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,114
HUSTLERS HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN
THE REMAINING.

602
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,032
TWO THEY CHOOSE ONE.

603
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,119
HEALERS LEFT WITH NUMBER TWO.

604
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,455
NEXT PHASE IS GETTING TO THE TOP
NOW.

605
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,540
HEROES OUT OF THE GATE FIRST.

606
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,582
>> YOU GOT IT.

607
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,002
>> Jeff: NOW YOU GOT TO GET
TWO PEOPLE TO THE TOP.

608
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,379
>> GO UP TOP.

609
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,173
>> Jeff: ALAN GOING UP, ASHLEY
GOING UP FOR THE HEROES.

610
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,967
IT IS COLE AND JOE FOR THE
HEALERS.

611
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,680
IT IS LAUREN AND RYAN, A
SURPRISING CHOICE TO BE PULLING

612
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,641
FOR THE HUSTLERS.

613
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,310
THIS SLED IS HEAVY.

614
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,187
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF
TEAMWORK.

615
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,857
JOE TAKING A LONG TIME TO EVEN
GET TO THE TOP.

616
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,985
THEY CAN'T START PULLING UNTIL
HE GETS THERE.

617
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,820
>> THREE, TWO, ONE!

618
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,155
THREE, TWO, ONE!

619
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,656

>> Jeff: COLE AND JOE GOING TO
PULL FOR THE HEALERS.

621
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,827
>> WATCH OUT.

622
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,870
WATCH YOUR LEG.

623
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,498
>> Jeff: THE HEALERS WORKING
TO MAKE UP SOME TIME.

624
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,334
>> GUIDE US IN, GUIDE US IN.

625
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,669
>> Jeff: HUSTLERS GET UP
FIRST.

626
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,004
HEROS HAVE THEIRS.

627
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,130
HEALERS NOW HAVE THEIRS.

628
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,884
YOU GOT TO LOCK IN YOUR HANDLES
NOW.

629
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:22,057
IT IS CHRISSY AND BEN FOR THE
HEROES IN A TRADITIONAL PHASE,

630
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:29,064
DEVON AND ALI FOR THE HUSTLERS
ON THE OBSTACLE MAZE.

631
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,690
MIKE AND DESI FOR THE HEALERS.

632
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,569
THIS IS WHERE ADRENALINE WORKS
AGAINST YOU BECAUSE YOU BRAIN IS

633
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,571
PLAYING, PLEASE SLOW DOWN SO I
CAN THINK.

634
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,366
THERE IS DEFINITELY A LEARNING
CURVE, LIKE MOST "SURVIVOR"

635
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:39,991
CHALLENGES.

636
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:40,784
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT.

637
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,620
>> WHEN THERE IS A BAR ON THE
RIGHT.

638
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,622
LEAN A LITTLE RIGHT.

639
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,206
>> GOOD.

640
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:46,790
>> THAT'S IT.

641
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,042
>> NOW LEAN A LITTLE LEFT.

642
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:49,793
YES, YES!

643
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,587
>> Jeff: HEALERS WITH A NICE
TOUCH.

644
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,380
AND THEY HAVE IT.

645
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,798
THE HEALERS HAVE THEIR FIRST
BALL.

646
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,257
>> GREAT JOB, YOU GUYS.

647
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,384
YOU HAVE THIS NOW.

648
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,428
>> Jeff: NOW THE HEROES AND
HUSTLERS ARE FEELING THAT

649
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:00,970
PRESSURE.

650
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,639
NICE MOVE BY THE HEROES.

651
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,224
THEY'RE FIGURING IT OUT.

652
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,227
HUSTLERS GETTING CLOSE.

653
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,103
>> YES!

654
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,270
>> Jeff: HUSTLERS HAVE THEIR
FIRST POINT.

655
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:14,943
IT IS NOW HEALERS WITH ONE,
HUSTLERS WITH ONE, HEROES YET TO

656
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,944
GET ON THE BOARD.

657
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,737
HEROS HAVE THEIR FIRST BALL.

658
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,947
MOVING ON TO THEIR SECOND.

659
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,451
WE ARE TIED NOW 1-1.

660
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,120
HEALERS ARE THROUGH.

661
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,997
THEY'RE CLOSE TO THEIR SECOND IF
THEY CAN SAVE IT.

662
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,668
THEY HAVE THE SECOND BALL FOR
THE HEALERS.

663
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,130
HUSTLERS VERY CLOSE TO LANDING
THEIR SECOND BALL.

664
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,800
HEROES ARE ONCE AGAIN VERY
CLOSE.

665
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,137
HEROES IN AND OUT.

666
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,971
HEROES HAVE THEIR SECOND.

667
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,181
AND THE HUSTLERS DROP RIGHT
BEHIND THEM.

668
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,600
IT IS 2-2-2.

669
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,768
HEALERS VERY CLOSE.

670
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,770
>> STEADY, MIKE.

671
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,232
>> Jeff: DR. MIKE AND DESI
TRYING TO'D THAT IN FOR THE WIN.

672
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,860
HEALERS WIN FIRST IMMUNITY.

673
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,779
THEY ARE SAFE FROM TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

674
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,656
>> JEFF, JEFF.

675
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:04,159
>> Jeff: WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE
MORE.

676
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,660
>> SLOW, SLOW.

677
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,121
>> Jeff: HUSTLERS ARE AROUND
THEIR DIFFICULT SPOT.

678
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,707
THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO CLOSING
THIS OUT.

679
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,002
THIS IS THE BIG MOVE RIGHT HERE
FOR THE HERO TRIBE.

680
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,797
TOUGHEST SPOT ON THEIR MAZE.

681
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,799
CHRISSY AND BEN WITH A NATION
MOVE AND THEY'RE THROUGH.

682
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,801
>> TOO FAR BACK, TOO FAR BACK.

683
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,470
>> Jeff: THERE IS A SHOWDOWN.

684
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:28,016
WHO CAN GET THAT THIRD BALL TO
DROP FIRST?

685
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,518
HEROS IN AND OUT.

686
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,021
>> SLOW.

687
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,857
>> Jeff: BOTH TRIBES
MANEUVERING THAT BALL TO GET IT

688
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,030
TO DROP.

689
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,991
HUSTLERS WIN IMMUNITY, SENDING
THE HERO TRIBE TO TRIBAL

690
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,409
COUNCIL.

691
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,244
>> GOOD JOB.

692
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,496
>> WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

693
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,707
>> OH, MY GOD, YES!

694
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:58,755
OH, MY GOD.

695
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,550
>> Jeff: HEALER TRIBE,
CONGRATULATIONS.

696
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,511
IMPRESSIVE START, TWO WINS IN A
ROW.

697
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,764
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR
TRIBE.

698
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,266
HUSTLERS, NOBODY GOING HOME FROM
YOUR TRIBE, AS WELL.

699
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,019
IN ADDITION, FIRE IN THE FORM OF
FLINT.

700
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,229
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

701
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,858
>> THANKS, JEFF.

702
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,236
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, ARE YOU ALL
RIGHT?

703
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,362
CHRISSY, DO YOU NEED A HAND?

704
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,198
DO YOU WANT MEDICAL OR DO YOU
WANT YOUR TRIBE TO HELP?

705
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:31,746
>> I JUST...

706
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,539
>> Jeff: THAT'S IT.

707
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,456
LET IT OUT.

708
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,043
WE HAVE MEDICAL HERE IF YOU NEED
IT, CHRISSY.

709
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,337
>> YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

710
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,589
>> YOU CAN'T SAY THAT WE DIDN'T
GIVE OUR ALL.

711
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,925
>> WE DID OUR BEST.

712
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,553
>> WE'RE GOING THE MAKE LEMONADE
OUT OF LEMONS.

713
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,972
>> Jeff: THIS IS WHAT
"SURVIVOR" IS ALL ACTED.

714
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,433
YOU RELY ON EACH OTHER, AND THE
COMPLICATION IS YOU HAVE TO GET

715
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,893
RID OF EACH OTHER.

716
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,105
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT,
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF

717
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:57,730
"SURVIVOR: HEROES V. HEALERS V.

718
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,523
HUSTLERS."

719
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,107
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

720
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,275
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

721
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,109
>> OKAY.

722
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,902
I'M GOOD.

723
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,114
>> I FOUND THIS SUPER IMMUNITY
IDOL.

724
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,741
IT IS ONLY GOOD FOR THE FIRST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

725
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,161
SO I NOW HAVE TO GIVE TOILET A
MEMBER OF THAT LOSING TRIBE.

726
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,623
I CAN GIVE THIS TO SOMEONE WHO
IS IN THE MINORITY AND SAVE THEM

727
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,710
TONIGHT, AND THEY CAN TAKE OUT
SOMEONE WHO MAY BE A THREAT AND

728
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,795
CHANGE THE GAME.

729
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:44,694
>> BEFORE LAST NIGHT THIS VOTE
WAS EASY.

730
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,030
>> I LOVE OUR TRIBE THE WAY IT
IS.

731
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,698
IT'S TOO BAD IT HAS TO CHANGE,
HUH?

732
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,657
>> YEAH.

733
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,742
>> THIS IS NOT HOW IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO START.

734
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,662
>> ALAN CREATED BASICALLY A
SPECTACLE OUT OF NOTHING.

735
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,958
>> GO GET SOME WATER?

736
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,168
>> GO GET FIREWOOD.

737
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:00,752
>> YEAH.

738
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,295
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO COME?

739
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,463
>> YEAH.

740
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,300
>> IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS,
EVERYTHING WENT FROM 100% WE'RE

741
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:12,138
SAFE, SOLID FOUR, TO THERE
REALLY IS NO TRUST.

742
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,350
>> ALL RIGHT.

743
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,310
KATRINA, WE ALL GOOD?

744
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:17,727
>> I'M GOOD.

745
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,979
>> FOR TONIGHT?

746
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:20,521
>> ASH?

747
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,689
>> EASY, RIGHT?

748
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,231
>> YEAH.

749
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:22,857
>> YOU?

750
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,150
>> I'M GOOD.

751
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,653
>> LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE.

752
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,740
>> ASHLEY AND J.P. THINK THAT
I'M STILL IN THE CORE FOUR WITH

753
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,284
THEM, BUT I DON'T TRUST ASHLEY
AND J.P. FURTHER THAN I CAN

754
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,077
THROW THEM.

755
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,662
THEY MIGHT BE LIKE, ALAN GOT TO
GO.

756
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,747
SO WHATEVER THEY TRYING TO DO,
I'M BLOWING IT UP.

757
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,376
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

758
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,544
>> AIN'T NOBODY BEEN TALKING TO
ME ABOUT GAME?

759
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,170
>> NOBODY HAS.

760
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,546
>> WE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER.

761
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,006
>> WE STILL GOT ONLY TWO VOTES.

762
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,385
>> WE COULD GO WITH CHRISSY AND
BEN?

763
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,887
>> CHRISSY?

764
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,848
COME HERE.

765
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,392
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

766
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,395
>> THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING?

767
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,855
I NOBODY HAS TALKED GAME WITH
ME.

768
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,441
SHE'S SAYING NO ONE HAS TALKED
GAME WITH HER EITHER.

769
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,734
SO THAT'S TWO.

770
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,736
>> SO YOU THINK IT'S YOU AND YOU
THINK IT'S YOU, BECAUSE I THINK

771
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,112
IT'S ME?

772
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,738
>> YEAH, YEAH.

773
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,741
I DO THINK THE THREE OF US PLUS
BEN CAN MAKE A STRONG FOUR.

774
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,909
>> I DON'T FEEL SAFE.

775
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,703
I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ALLIANCE ON
THE TEAM.

776
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,414
I KNEW I NEED TO GET PEOPLE TO
VOTE TOGETHER.

777
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,915
WE NEED FOUR PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR
SOMEBODY.

778
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:23,418
>> WE'RE HAVE A QUICK POWWOW.

779
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,752
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A
PLAN.

780
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,920
>> ASHLEY AND J.F.K. TALK.

781
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,380
THEY PROBABLY HAVE A PLAN.

782
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,882
>> IF THAT WAS THE CASE, WHO
RIGHT NOW?

783
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,092
>> ASHLEY.

784
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,388
>> RIGHT NOW I THINK I HAVE PLAN
WITH CHRISSY, ALAN, AND BEN.

785
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:39,100
I HAVE TO PUT FAITH IN THREE
PEOPLE I'M NOT SURE TOTALLY HAVE

786
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:39,934
MY BACK.

787
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:43,771
HOPEFULLY IT WORKS.

788
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,565
>> I'M WITH YOU.

789
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,441
IT KEEPS US STRONG.

790
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:51,571
>> I JUST KNOW ASHLEY, SHE'S A
WILD CARD.

791
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,740
>> WE'RE STILL KEEPING OUR EYES
OPEN.

792
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,284
>> IF EVERYONE WOULD HAVE
STUCKED TO THE PLAN AND CALM

793
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,286
DOWN AND TALKED IT OUT, WE'D BE
FINE.

794
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,330
BUT HERE WE ARE, DAY THREE, AND
WE'VE ALL JUST BLOWN UP.

795
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,665
>> I FEEL GOOD WITH THE PLAN.

796
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,333
>> GOOD PLAN.

797
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,795
>> YEP.

798
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,590
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT,
THERE'S TWO WAYS ALAN AND I CAN

799
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,799
GO.

800
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,635
WE CAN GO WITH THE MOM SQUAD AND
GO STRAIGHT FOR ASHLEY, OR WE

801
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,975
CAN GO WITH J.P. AND ASHLEY AND
GET CHRISSY OR KATRINA OUT.

802
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:24,145
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT
ASHLEY AND J.P. HAVING SOMETHING

803
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,775
GOING ON, BUT AS A TRIBE, WE
HAVE TO STAY STRONG, AND THE TWO

804
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,153
OLDER WOMEN ARE PROBABLY THE
WEAKEST LINKS IN OUR TRIBE.

805
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,615
WHETHER OR NOT YOU GO WITH
STRENGTH OR LOYALTY, IN THE LONG

806
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,701
RUN IT'S ABOUT ALAN AND I, WHO
WE TRUST MOST.

807
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:45,875
WE'RE GETTING LOW ON TIME,
Y'ALL.

808
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,960
>> I WAS GETTING READY FOR
TRIBAL.

809
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,045
I LOOKED IN MY BAG.

810
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,129
I SEE A PACKAGE.

811
00:34:50,213 --> 00:35:00,473
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

812
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,682
>> OH, MY GOSH.

813
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,977
SOMEONE HAS SECRETLY CHOSEN YOU
TO RECEIVE IMMENSE POWER EARLY

814
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,646
IN THE GAME.

815
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,023
OH, MY GOSH.

816
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:11,484
THIS IS AN IMMUNITY SUPER IDOL.

817
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,987
THIS IDOL CAN BE PLAYED AFTER
THE VOTES HAVE BEEN READ, BUT IT

818
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,366
CAN ONLY BE USED AT TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

819
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,200
WOW.

820
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,327
HOW LUCKY DID I GET?

821
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,832
I GOT THE SUPER IMMUNITY IDOL,
AND IT FEELS INCREDIBLE.

822
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:31,087
I THINK THE DECISION OF WHAT I
DO WITH THIS SUPER IDOL IS

823
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,258
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY
SINCE HALF THE TRIBE IS

824
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,885
POTENTIALLY ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK, KATRINA, ME, ASHLEY,

825
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,095
ALAN, WE DON'T KNOW.

826
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,848
CLEARLY IF IT'S ME ON THE BLOCK,
I'M USING IT TO SAVE MYSELF.

827
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,351
I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT PLAYS
OUT, AND I'M GOING TO LET THE

828
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,062
DISCUSSION AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
DICTATE WHETHER I PLAY IT AND

829
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:50,189
FOR WHOM.

830
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,050
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.

831
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,552
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.

832
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:26,225
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

833
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:30,771
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE FIRE

834
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,606
REPRESENTS LIFE.

835
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,232
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.

836
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,234
SADLY, THAT WILL BE THE CASE FOR
SOMEBODY.

837
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,112
BEN, ARE YOU FEELING, MAN, THE
GAME REALLY DOES MOVE THIS FAST?

838
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,239
>> IT'S EXCITING.

839
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:40,948
IT'S SCARY.

840
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,075
>> Jeff: BUT?

841
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,412
>> BUT THAT'S THE GAME WE ALL
CAME TO PLAY.

842
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,580
SO...

843
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,624
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, WHAT WAS THE
VIBE THOSE FIRST FEW MOMENTS

844
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,791
WHEN YOU HIT THE BEACH?

845
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,670
>> IMMEDIATELY I FELT THAT I DID
NOT BELONG WITH THIS GROUP.

846
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,922
>> Jeff: REALLY?

847
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,966
>> YEAH, I HONESTLY FELT THAT
THE FOUR MAJOR PHYSICAL THREATS

848
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,260
WOULD PROBABLY GET TOGETHER.

849
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,470
>> Jeff: AND WHO IS THAT?

850
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,015
>> ASHLEY, J.P., ALAN, AND BEN.

851
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,809
>> Jeff: KATRINA, DID YOU HAVE
THE SAME FEELING?

852
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,313
>> YEAH, BEING OLDER THAN A LOT
OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE HERE, THEY

853
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,274
MIGHT LOOK TO US TO BE VOTED OUT
FIRST SERVICE SOMEBODY ELSE.

854
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,152
>> Jeff: ASHLEY, ONE OF THE
UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME IS

855
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:21,739
YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT EVER EVEN

856
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,907
MEET OTHERWISE.

857
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,201
THE PEOPLE OUT HERE WILL TELL
YOU EXACTLY WHAT THEY THINK,

858
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,494
TRUE OR NOT, WE NEVER KNOW.

859
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,495
>> RIGHT.

860
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,664
THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU NEVER
KNOW IN THIS GAME.

861
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,123
YOU KIND OF FIGURE THAT OUT.

862
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,375
>> Jeff: HOW SO?

863
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,669
>> DAY TWO AND A HALF THERE WAS
ALREADY A LITTLE COMMOTION GOING

864
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,670
ON.

865
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,048
ALAN PULLS J.P. AND ME AND SAYS,
WE HAVE AN IDOL.

866
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,217
NO CLUE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

867
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,011
>> EITHER AN IDOL OR A CLUE.

868
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,097
>> I'M NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN
FROM SAYING THAT.

869
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,933
>> JEFF, WE TRIED OUR BEST TO
CONVINCE HIM THAT WHAT HE THINKS

870
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,810
HE SAW IS NOT TRUE.

871
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,689
>> BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO
CHANGE MY MIND, YOU DENY, DENY,

872
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,731
DENY, DENY.

873
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,026
>> HE HAD J.P. STRIP ALL HIS
CLOTHES TO CHECK FOR A

874
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,069
NON-EXISTENT IDOL.

875
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,738
>> Jeff: SO J.P., YOU'RE
WRAPPED UP IN THIS, AS WELL.

876
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,031
>> I GUESS A LITTLE BIT.

877
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,199
>> Jeff: A LITTLE BIT?

878
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:08,244
YOU TOOK YOUR CLOTHES OFF TO
PROVE YOU DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.

879
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,120
>> IT'S PART OF THE GAME.

880
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,913
EVERYBODY IS WELCOME TO THEIR
OPINIONS.

881
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,498
YOU CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.

882
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,668
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, ONE THING
ABOUT SURVIVOR IS THE MINUTE YOU

883
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,130
GET LINKED WITH SOMEBODY ELSE,
NOW YOU'RE SEEN AS TWO VOTES.

884
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,172
>> YEAH.

885
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,550
AND THAT REALLY IS WHAT HAPPENED
IN THIS SITUATION.

886
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,553
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT WE HAD
A POWER COUPLE.

887
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,181
TO HAVE THE TERM POWER COUPLE
EVEN THROWN AROUND IS RIDICULOUS

888
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:29,724
TO ME.

889
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,891
THERE IS NO ME AND J.P.

890
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,144
THERE HAS BEEN NO CONVERSATION
OTHER THAN RIGHT IN FRONT OF

891
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,228
YOU.

892
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,479
>> THINK THING WAS TO LET THE
TRIBE KNOW THAT THERE'S

893
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,191
SOMETHING STRONGER IN THE TRIBE
THAN THE TRIBE, WHETHER THESE

894
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,736
FOLKS BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE, I
KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

895
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,487
I'M NOT CRAZY.

896
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,238
I'M CONFIDENT.

897
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:45,322
>> YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL VERY
SILLY.

898
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:50,036
>> IF I GO HOME TONIGHT BECAUSE
I'M SILLY, SO BE IT.

899
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,747
BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO
BICKER AND BANTER ABOUT.

900
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,749
THIS WE ARE LABELED THE HEROES.

901
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,460
WE NEED TO HAVE THE MENTALITY
THAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE PLANNED

902
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,254
AND MAKE OUR TEAM STRONG AND
THEN WE'LL HASH OUT WHATEVER WE

903
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:02,548
NEED THE HASH OUT LATER.

904
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:06,469
>> Jeff: ALAN, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE BEN HAS ANOTHER PLAN THAT

905
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,928
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT'S
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

906
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,055
>> DEFINITELY.

907
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,766
I COULD HAVE AFFORDED TO SIT
BACK WITH MY FEET UP AND BE

908
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,141
COMFORTABLE.

909
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,267
I COULD HAVE.

910
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,562
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS HAD THE
TALK ABOUT GETTING RID OF

911
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,646
KATRINA.

912
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,732
EVERYBODY IS THROWING OUT NAMES
TO GET RID OF CHRISSY.

913
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,943
BUT THAT'S THE RISK I HAD TO
TAKE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW EXACTLY

914
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,111
WHAT'S GOING ON.

915
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,781
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, ALAN SAID,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE EARLY

916
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,074
TALK WAS, THE TWO OLDER WOMEN.

917
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,452
>> THAT FEELS TERRIBLE, OF
COURSE.

918
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,912
I THINK THAT WOULD BE UNWISE.

919
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,748
I THINK THAT VOTING ME OFF IS
LOSING MY SKILLS.

920
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,793
>> JEFF, I THINK THERE'S A POINT
WHERE EVERYBODY IS AT THE

921
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,754
CHOPPING BLOCK AT SOME POINT AND
WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE CAN DO TO

922
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,298
CONNECT WITH PEOPLE, BECAUSE IF
WE CAN ALL STAY MORE HONEST

923
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:47,843
ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING,
WE'LL GET FURTHER IN THE TRIBE

924
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,345
THAN PRETENDING THESE THINGS
DON'T EXIST.

925
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,098
>> JEFF, I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT.

926
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,517
WE HAD A PLAN, BUT IT'S UP IN
THE AIR.

927
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,811
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOME
DAMAGE CONTROL ONE WAY OR THE

928
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,812
OTHER.

929
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:02,608
PERIOD.

930
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,109
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

931
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,819
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

932
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:14,912
KATRINA, YOU'RE UP.

933
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:22,002
KATRINA, YOU'RE UP.

934
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:40,729
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

935
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,859
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

936
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:49,530
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

937
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,489
OKAY.

938
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,574
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

939
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,034
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

940
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,369
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

941
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:58,414
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

942
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,750
FIRST VOTE KATRINA.

943
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,503
ASHLEY.

944
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,087
KATRINA.

945
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,924
THAT'S TWO VOTES KATRINA.

946
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:09,425
KATRINA.

947
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,759
THREE VOTES KATRINA.

948
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,180
ONE VOTE ASHLEY.

949
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:19,727
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: HEROES V. HEALERS V.

950
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,148
HUSTLERS," KATRINA.

951
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:24,565
THAT'S FOUR.

952
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,232
S THAT ENOUGH.

953
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:33,032
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

954
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,577
KATRINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

955
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,620
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

956
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:42,458
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

958
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,922
We go further, so you can.

959
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:50,966
>> Jeff: WELL, WHILE THE VOTE
WAS UNITED, THIS TRIBE IS

960
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,425
CLEARLY NOT.

961
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,885
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

962
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,594
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

963
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,181
GOOD NIGHT.
