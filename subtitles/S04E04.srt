1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,085
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,337
<i>Survivor:</i>
Injuries plagued Rotu while

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,256
building their raft.
>> Nice work, butcher.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,882
>> Okay, okay, okay.
>> PROBST: Go!

5
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,468
But it all paid off in the end,
as their raft led them to

6
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,262
victory at the reward challenge.
Rotu!

7
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,597
(cheering)
Taking advantage of Maraamu's

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,934
low morale, Rob strategized
behind the scenes, and was the

9
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,812
puppet master of the tribe.
>> Fear keeps people loyal.

10
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,606
If they're afraid they have
something to lose, they're going

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,609
to do what I tell them to do and
not know that I'm telling them

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,278
to do it.
That's straight out of<i> The</i>

13
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,947
<i>Godfather.</i>
>> PROBST: Rotu remained

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,076
untouchable with another victory
at the immunity challenge.

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,411
Immunity.
(cheering)

16
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,079
Nice job.
At Tribal Council,

17
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,416
Maraamu followed Rob's lead and
voted Hunter off the island.

18
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:46,296
>> Good luck, you guys.
>> PROBST: The tribe has spoken.

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,717
13 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

20
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:19,097
(indistinct voices)
>> Without a doubt, I think this

21
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,891
is my game, and I'm the one
that's controlling it, for the

22
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,228
most part.
I don't think Hunter saw it

23
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,439
coming a mile away.
>> Need some more... more

24
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:33,194
stuff.
>> Last night at Tribal Council

25
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:37,282
the four other members decided
to vote out Hunter, which I

26
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,368
think was a pretty stupid idea.
>> There you go.

27
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,579
You got it.
>> I think the reason being is

28
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,707
because Rob and Sean were tired
of having somebody else in a

29
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,418
leadership role, and now they're
ready to take over.

30
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,713
You can see it in what they do.
I mean, we come back and we got

31
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,257
to build a fire.
And I think that was their main

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,428
motivation in getting him off.
I thought I was the one gone.

33
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,932
I just want to know why you vote
one of your strongest members

34
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,809
out.
>> I think we all probably had a

35
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,145
different reason.
>> I mean I'm glad I'm here.

36
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,314
>> Uh-huh.
>> 'Cause I thought I was going.

37
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,274
But I'm just, I'm really just
shocked.

38
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,735
>> Basically just kind of do
something different.

39
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,445
I'm just like not the big
picture.

40
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,573
I mean, the game has no rules.
>> I know, I mean, we talked,

41
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,950
and I told you why we voted on
each other.

42
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,953
So I just, if you guys want to
tell me, that's fine.

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,748
If not, then, that's fine, too.
I'm just asking.

44
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,499
Nobody had a good explanation,
no one.

45
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,669
Sarah's explanation was she just
felt like, you know, she had two

46
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,796
people and that's who she wanted
to vote on.

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,758
Well, Rob voted on that person,
that's why she voted on him.

48
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,303
She doesn't think for herself,
Rob tells her what to vote on.

49
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,681
>> I don't know, it's hard to
explain what I was thinking.

50
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,475
You thought you were the one to
go?

51
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,311
>> I mean, I thought it would be
stupid to vote him out.

52
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,480
>> I'm glad I voted the way I
did.

53
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,815
>> After seeing the votes I'm
glad I voted the way I did, too.

54
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,818
>> They think it's the beginning
of Maraamu-- I have no idea.

55
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,363
I hope it's not the end, because
I don't want to go.

56
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,657
I'll be the next to go.
If we lose, I'm gone.

57
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,994
They're not going to keep
somebody like me around.

58
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,801
>> This is a big pig tail in the
back.

59
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,178
>> A big pig tail?
>> A big braided pig tail.

60
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,972
>> Yeah, like a Barbie doll
thing.

61
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,182
>> Oh, yeah.
Perfect.

62
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,518
>> Let me see. There you go!
>> Thanks, babe.

63
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,729
>> I jammed.
>> You did, you did a great job.

64
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,190
>> No lumps.
>> Good morning, buddy.

65
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,860
>> This tribe is a family.
We've said that from day one.

66
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,823
I don't know that the mood could
be any better.

67
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,702
It's just a real calm, peaceful
feeling.

68
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,414
It's just family pride here, and
I don't think the other team has

69
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,416
that.
>> I think as every day

70
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,128
passes here, I think our tribe
is beginning to find more of its

71
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,046
groove.
People are beginning to relax a

72
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,173
little bit.
I mean, yesterday was honestly

73
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,176
the best day I've had here.
>> Yeah.

74
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,721
>> Hey, buddy.
>> This tribe is unbelievable.

75
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,224
The reason we keep winning is
because of the unity and love

76
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:12,395
that is in this tribe.
It's an unreal experience to see

77
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,274
eight people coming together
every single day to provide for

78
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,527
each other, not just rally
around each other for a

79
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,281
challenge, but every single day
doing an activity that will

80
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,785
provide for the rest of the
group.

81
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,080
>> I am preparing toasted
coconut.

82
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,585
There was a discovery last night
by the infamous, infamous Chef,

83
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,464
John, to try and make our food
taste better, and we just

84
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,718
happened to discover that the
coconut just got burned on the

85
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,929
bottom of the pan and it tasted
really good.

86
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,059
>> Survivor snacks.
It's warm, so be careful.

87
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,769
Is it good?
>> Oh!

88
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,440
Let's just make that every two
hours on the two hours.

89
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,986
>> The bottom line is, everybody
in this tribe likes each other

90
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,781
and respects each other as
individuals.

91
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,451
Whether we wanted it or not,
we've become a second sort of

92
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,953
family.
And it's a good thing, it works

93
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:21,005
for us.
>> We have mail!

94
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:32,350
for us.
>> We have mail!

95
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:42,193
>> Okay.
Here we go. Listen up.

96
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:47,824
"Challenges of brain and brawn
are nothing compared to this.

97
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:53,830
Your world will turn, your head
will spin, as you stand upon the

98
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,791
disk."
>> Might be like a wheel of

99
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,668
fortune.
>> Into the water?

100
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,878
>> Could be like if you get
dizzy or not.

101
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,047
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Today's mail was a disk, it

102
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,508
was a wooden disk.
We kind of, like, threw some

103
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,386
ideas around, but then we
decided we're just going to shut

104
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,722
up and wait.
In a nutshell, we've assumed

105
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,766
every single one.
We have been wrong on every

106
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,518
single one.
So maybe today when we go in

107
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,562
there, expecting the unexpected,
who knows?

108
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:22,441
>> Here's where the game gets
really interesting.

109
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,829
>> PROBST: Hello, guys.
>> Hello.

110
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:40,710
>> What's up?
>> PROBST: All right.

111
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,130
Today is not a reward challenge
or an immunity challenge, but it

112
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,175
is an activity of sorts, and
certainly some of you will be

113
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,969
rewarded and others no doubt, as
always, will go back

114
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,891
disappointed.
Let's begin.

115
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,229
Okay.
First step, pick a disk, doesn't

116
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,857
matter, it's totally random.
Follow your gut.

117
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:12,909
Go wherever you want.
Okay.

118
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:22,251
Go wherever you want.
Okay.

119
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,128
Zoe, you're first.
Step off your disk.

120
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:29,425
Flip it over.
Pull off your new buff.

121
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,260
Take your old one off.
Put your new one on.

122
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:36,933
Nothing changes for you, you're
still on Rotu.

123
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,394
Put it on, and take a spot over
here.

124
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:56,953
Gina, you're next.
No harm, no foul, still with

125
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:05,795
Maraamu.
Gabe.

126
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,218
Pick a spot on your new mat.
You're still Rotu.

127
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:20,810
Neleh.
First change.

128
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,187
Now part of Maraamu.
Take a spot on the mat with

129
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,191
Gina.
>> Welcome.

130
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:32,822
>> PROBST: John.
No change.

131
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,825
You're still with Rotu.
Take a spot on the mat.

132
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:43,791
V... here goes.
Swap out, you're now a member of

133
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,502
Rotu.
>> God is still good,

134
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,879
regardless.
>> PROBST: Say hi to your new

135
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,715
tribe members.
>> What's up, babies?

136
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:59,307
>> PROBST: Rob.
You're now a member of Rotu.

137
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:08,649
>> Hi, Robster.
>> PROBST: Kathy...

138
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:13,529
you're now a member of Maraamu.
Say hello to your new tribe

139
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:22,204
mates.
Sean.

140
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:27,335
You're now a member of Rotu.
>> Sean, man.

141
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:33,215
>> John.
>> PROBST: Sarah.

142
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:40,723
Okay, Sarah, same buff, still a
member of Maraamu.

143
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,725
>> What's up, ladies?
>> The chicks, man!

144
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,227
The chicks are here!
>> It's all about the chicks.

145
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:52,234
>> Yes, Sarah, Kathy, Neleh.
>> PROBST: Robert, you're up.

146
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,197
You're a member of Rotu.
The new Rotu.

147
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,618
>> Hey, Rob.
>> What's up, man?

148
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,245
>> What's up, man?
>> It's going to be all women.

149
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,917
>> Mm-hmm.
>> PROBST: Paschal.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,087
>> All right!
>> Yeah, pappy's on our team!

151
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,589
>> We got pappy.
>> PROBST: You're now a member

152
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:20,930
of Maraamu.
>> Nice to meet you.

153
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,891
>> You, too.
>> PROBST: All right, Tammy,

154
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:30,564
you're last.
Join your new tribe.

155
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,733
>> What's up, tribe?
>> What's up, sweetie?

156
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,236
>> So good!
It's good to get to know new

157
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,780
people.
>> Welcome, guys. How you doing?

158
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,574
>> PROBST: All right.
These are the new tribes.

159
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,244
Maraamu, Rotu.
The number of tribe members in

160
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,789
each tribe hasn't changed, just
the members within the tribe.

161
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,459
And let me assure you that like
everything else in this game,

162
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,921
this part of your destiny was
planned long before you guys

163
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,923
even got to the Marquesas
Islands.

164
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:00,136
I have no doubt that some of you
are probably looking at this as

165
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,055
a reprieve, others may see it as
a sentence.

166
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,474
It is neither.
It's just the game.

167
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,812
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
>> What's your name? Tammy?

168
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,272
>> I'm Rob.
>> Rob.

169
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,483
>> Sean.
>> Nice to meet you.

170
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:20,156
>> Sean, baby.
(sobbing gently)

171
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:30,207
>> It's good, it's good.
>> Oh, my God.

172
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:35,713
>> It's good, it's good.
>> Oh, my God.

173
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,174
>> This is our new house, you
guys.

174
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,509
>> This is so beautiful.
>> Let's show you guys around.

175
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,679
>> What is this here?
>> This is the breadfruit, this

176
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,765
is a mango tree.
>> When we got back for the

177
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,351
first time the new group, it was
interesting, we walked around

178
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,061
and showed them the fruit trees
that we had.

179
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,481
So all you got to do is pick up
the limes off the ground.

180
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,357
>> There's a rooster.
>> Their limes are on the

181
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,067
ground! Hello!
>> Yeah, there's a rooster.

182
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,154
It was very exhilarating to
actually see some people who

183
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,323
didn't want to just sit around
and be lazy.

184
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,617
>> You guys, check out this
grapefruit tree!

185
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,203
There's zillions of them.
(laughing)

186
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,916
>> Strawberries.
>> Oh!

187
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,212
>> Watch your head!
>> Whoo-whee!

188
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,715
>> I just came from a tribe that
would get up at dawn, check the

189
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,718
pig pit, you know, and go out
and forage for shells.

190
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,180
So to us we feel like we're at a
four-star hotel, that there's

191
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,099
fruit on the table.
So it's pretty nice.

192
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,393
>> You guys, look at all the
fruit!

193
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:37,066
(indistinct voices)
>> Didn't you say you have

194
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,068
mangos, too?
>> Oh, heck, you guys.

195
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,445
Grapefruit just made my whole
entire day.

196
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,157
>> It was nice to get away, you
know, and see some new scenery.

197
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,619
The beach here is beautiful.
And the fruit definitely by far

198
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,789
outdoes everything over at Rotu.
I would have chosen here over

199
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,209
that place for the fruit.
>> So, what do you all do in

200
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,086
real life?
>> I was a teacher until this

201
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,922
year, and then I took off.
I'm bartending, saving money for

202
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,465
grad school.
>> Oh, cool. Yeah.

203
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,260
>> I'm a real estate broker, but
I'm going back to school,

204
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,178
changing careers.
>> Are you? For what?

205
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,597
>> Environmental studies.
>> That's what I'm doing!

206
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,057
>> Come on.
>> Get out of here!

207
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,601
>> Gina and Kathy right away had
something in common.

208
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,187
They're both all about the
environment and want to go

209
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,189
hiking and do all that.
So that was good.

210
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,609
Gina found someone right away.
We have a morning show every

211
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,611
morning.
Sean is really, really funny.

212
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,655
We each had a part in the
morning show.

213
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,949
I was the beauty.
She was the sports report,

214
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,243
Hunter was the, uh, helicopter
weather guy.

215
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,620
>> Hunter's the one they voted
off last night.

216
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,456
>> Last night. I thought...
we called him surfer boy.

217
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,750
We thought he'd make it until
the end, dude.

218
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,253
>> He was, yeah, he was strong,
he was a hard worker.

219
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,463
He was everything.
Just the four people decided

220
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,465
just, for whatever reason to...
>> Really?

221
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,134
>> Yeah.
>> Nicest guy in the world.

222
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,595
>> I thought the tribe that had
been here was lazy.

223
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,598
And fortunately, those members
are no longer around, from what

224
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,310
I understand.
Having said that, the fruit

225
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,980
situation over here, which we
did not have over there, has

226
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,482
made everything just worthwhile
so far.

227
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,985
Oh, man!
>> I'd rather eat this than fish

228
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,280
any day.
>> Cheers.

229
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:16,332
>> To our new little family.
>> Nice little crib's better

230
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:23,839
>> To our new little family.
>> Nice little crib's better

231
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,549
than the projects.
>> Yeah.

232
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,885
>> So what is the routine of the
day?

233
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,679
What do you guys normally do?
>> Up at dawn.

234
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,015
>> Make sure we have water and
food.

235
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,225
>> Okay.
After the challenge we got

236
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,854
three new tribe members.
We got V, we got Rob and we got

237
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:42,191
Sean.
I couldn't have been happier

238
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,860
when they switched us up.
I love the people that I was

239
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,905
part of the first original eight
with, but I was also thrilled to

240
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,531
get some new people in our
tribe.

241
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,076
>> This is our coconut popcorn.
>> Oh, yeah, try that.

242
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,994
>> You gotta try that.
It's really good.

243
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,664
>> You guys hungry?
Want to get some taro cooking?

244
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,834
>> That has flavor to it!
>> When we landed here on Rotu

245
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:05,381
camp, I truly felt that there
was a genuine welcome.

246
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:10,344
But I also felt that their
expectation was for us to just

247
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,263
jump right in.
Because everybody was

248
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,933
immediately on their jobs.
>> You guys want to go get some

249
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,601
limes?
Will that be on the way to the

250
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,561
waterfall?
>> We've been getting 40 limes a

251
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,397
day, and we've been going
through them.

252
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,194
>> We noticed immediately these
people were like ants!

253
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,698
>> One.
>> They were... and we're

254
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,785
standing there like...
right now we'd be chilling, you

255
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,079
know?
Work done in the morning.

256
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,957
Afternoon, chill, the rest of
the day.

257
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,753
I tell you, at the other camp we
never even fired up our frying

258
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,381
pan.
Everything was sliced, slurp,

259
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,550
toss.
>> Those are our nicknames.

260
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,261
>> Johnny Pots and Pans.
Xena.

261
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,095
>> Tonga.
>> Scoop.

262
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,264
>> The General.
>> Scoop, Scoop and the

263
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,975
General, right.
>> At this point, I'm really not

264
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,562
sure how I'm going to overcome
the numerical advantage that

265
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,022
they hold.
Having five members stay and us

266
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,401
being the three newcomers.
The biggest thing now is going

267
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,071
to be to see how I'm going to be
able to bond with these other

268
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,325
people.
Gabe seems pretty cool, he's

269
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,454
definitely a brainiac.
He probably thinks he's a lot

270
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,999
smarter than he really is.
When I first saw John, I thought

271
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,252
he was a big-time queer.
I really don't know, he seems

272
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,547
kind of rough and tough over
here, but he does all the

273
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,632
cooking.
So I don't know, I won't be

274
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,136
sleeping next to him tonight,
not the first night, anyway.

275
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,805
The General seems like a nice
guy, also.

276
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,309
He's big and tough, and wants
everybody to know that.

277
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:45,105
Probably got a little sausage.
Tammy is engaged, there's not

278
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,150
too much hope there.
And Zoe is pretty nice, but...

279
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,152
come on.
Without a doubt, Zoe is

280
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,654
definitely the toughest guy in
this tribe.

281
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,492
I don't think this is the type
of group where I can jump in and

282
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,870
joke around and just be all
outlandish and stuff like I

283
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,499
could in the other group.
Definitely the game is changing,

284
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,044
and maybe for the better.
Maybe for the worse.

285
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:18,138
I don't know.
>> All right, the map!

286
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,307
>> And I am embarrassed to say,
I don't know how to pronounce

287
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,392
this tribe.
>> Maraamu.

288
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,520
>> Maraamu.
>> Maraamu.

289
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,356
>> Is that...
Where's your water, right there?

290
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,025
Our water's way up here.
>> We walked up the trail and

291
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:33,028
got water-- unbelievable to
actually see somebody want to go

292
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,404
get water.
>> Go ahead, mama.

293
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,698
>> All rightie.
>> So there is a new lease on

294
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,659
life.
I stayed with Maraamu, but I

295
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:42,371
got three new tribe members that
totally kick butt.

296
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,999
>> Hunter and I, we got water,
we got food, everything.

297
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,211
And he was so awesome.
We had so much in common.

298
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,421
He was the nicest guy in the
world.

299
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,216
I mean, I thought it was me
going last night.

300
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,218
So, it shocked the hell out of
me.

301
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,930
I mean, I can't believe they got
rid of Hunter, and then they

302
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,058
jumped down my throat for asking
why they did it.

303
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:06,061
Lazy, lazy.
This is our water, guys.

304
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:09,857
>> That's the water.
>> You guys would die if you saw

305
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,527
where we got water from.
(laughing)

306
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,779
I'm in shock.
Sorry, I usually jump in to

307
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,906
jobs.
>> But water is water when it's

308
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,741
boiled, so...
>> Oh, no, I know.

309
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,244
It's just the exact opposite of
what we got.

310
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,830
Isn't that funny?
It's very interesting being

311
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,249
away from Rotu.
Because that tribe is just

312
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,086
workaholics, and...
It's just weird being here.

313
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,590
Because it's so kicked back.
>> The guys are definitely going

314
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,133
to be...
>> Oh, the guys will be in

315
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,718
heaven.
>> I don't know, there's not

316
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,928
that much shellfish.
>> We're very happy with what

317
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,889
has turned out to be.
I know they're a little

318
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,600
disappointed because they had it
so well and their tribe was so

319
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,185
close, but since they have the
majority of the people they

320
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,937
could just pick off people on
each tribe.

321
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,773
And I definitely would not mind
it if that happened on the other

322
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,569
side.
They deserve what they get.

323
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,455
>> All right, so just start
some piles.

324
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,125
>> How much wood is this for,
for the entire day we're

325
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,045
collecting?
>> Yeah.

326
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:33,148
>> Pretty much, life over here
is about two degrees shy of

327
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,150
hell.
It's absolutely terrible.

328
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,820
It's a night and day difference
between the other camp.

329
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,616
These people are workaholics,
that's all they want to do.

330
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,035
They don't give you a second to
breathe.

331
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,955
Every two seconds somebody is
asking you to do something else.

332
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,999
>> We can dig this one up, this
one's a good one, but we do need

333
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,377
to make a new one.
I don't like this one very much.

334
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,006
It's not steep enough.
>> Why give in to this bull

335
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,469
crap?
That's all it is.

336
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,354
>> Believe me, I worked
construction for years, man.

337
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,523
I know what it's like to dig
ditches.

338
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,733
>> Really?
>> It's hard to do it with

339
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,028
shovels, let alone with freaking
oars and paddles, man.

340
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,241
>> I feel like we're doing too
much labor on this island.

341
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,910
Definitely feel like the master
is watching.

342
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,830
I'm like, slavery has been over.
I feel like we're in the woods.

343
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,581
I hear the<i> Roots</i> theme as we
speak.

344
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:39,798
Hear it?
By the end of the night, I'm so

345
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,718
tired all I want to do is lay
down, you know.

346
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:51,768
I want to sit around the fire.
So, Rob, how do you feel about

347
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,896
being over here?
>> To tell you the truth, I

348
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,108
really don't enjoy this part of
the island.

349
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:02,279
Yeah, the women over here
don't look half as good as they

350
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,782
did at our other tribe.
>> Oh, no, the women on our

351
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,410
island had big boobs with tiny
bikinis.

352
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:12,205
>> Over here, I think we got
eight guys on the island.

353
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,084
We got eight guys and one girl.
I think her name is John.

354
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:21,923
>> I don't know anything about
that one.

355
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,260
>> Ah, here's one of my favorite
girls right here.

356
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,554
Hmm, Tammy?
>> You just like me because I

357
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,264
bring you food.
>> That's right.

358
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:32,267
>> Take a handful, and I'll
bring it over to the other guys.

359
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,062
>> Tammy knows the deal.
>> Tammy knows what's up.

360
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,272
>> Thank you, Tammy.
>> Thank you, babe.

361
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,776
>> You're welcome.
>> Now see, see...

362
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,111
>> We could've used her
on the island.

363
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,656
>> She's all right.
Long as she keeps serving,

364
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,784
she'll do fine.
>> Minute she stops...

365
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,787
>> See ya later.
>> ...she's out.

366
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,957
>> If Sean and Rob decide not to
work, we will still feed them,

367
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,170
but their asses will be gone,
first vote.

368
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,964
>> Tomorrow, I think me and you
should go on a hike and

369
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,134
basically, what we'll do is,
we'll go around that corner over

370
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,678
there, and we'll chill out all
day.

371
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:18,772
What do you think? Cool?
>> This morning, we got up.

372
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:26,154
What do you think? Cool?
>> This morning, we got up.

373
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,366
We started a little fire.
Decided we were going to go for

374
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,451
a hike.
Filled up some water bottles,

375
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,453
and then took off around the
trail.

376
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,956
I look like I have the measles.
>> You ready, pappy?

377
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,166
>> I'm ready.
>> All right, you want to carry

378
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:48,218
a water?
>> Sarah, are you okay?

379
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:54,891
a water?
>> Sarah, are you okay?

380
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:59,187
>> Yeah, why?
>> Sarah just strolls.

381
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,150
She's a stroller.
>> Kathy decided she was going

382
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,528
to take lead, and somewhere
along the way we missed a trail

383
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,656
or something, but we got
sidetracked and basically got

384
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,658
lost.
>> Yeah, we're too high now.

385
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,328
We've got to traverse down.
We're going to backtrack just to

386
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,330
be safe, instead of sliding
down.

387
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,041
>> All right.
>> Everybody enjoyed it up to a

388
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,377
point.
And then I think people started

389
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,214
getting tired of the long hike
and wondering if we were getting

390
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,716
lost.
They weren't used to

391
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,010
bushwhacking.
I was used to it, so I was

392
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,554
feeling rather confident that
we'll be okay.

393
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,224
We either go to the lagoon or we
go back down and up and try to

394
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,768
find that trail.
But why don't we move over a

395
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,229
little bit further?
>> I'm game. Go ahead.

396
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,024
Neleh and Paschal, I think, were
very irritated.

397
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,694
Sometimes I see that Kathy gets
on their nerves just because she

398
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,865
is so aggressive.
And they're not aggressive

399
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,202
people; they're very passive.
>> They're back there.

400
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,871
I'm not waiting. Sorry.
>> They were irritated with her

401
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,916
because she wanted to go on, and
that might tend to break down

402
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:05,795
after a while their bond that
they have.

403
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,260
>> It was hard going, somewhat.
But we finally found this very,

404
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,096
very deep rock pool.
>> There is the biggest shrimp,

405
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,098
you guys.
>> Look at that shrimp, you

406
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,808
guys, hurry, look.
>> It's huge.

407
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,936
>> Oh, my God.
I don't know if that is.

408
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,312
Is that a shrimp?
>> Yeah.

409
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,772
>> It's a shrimp.
>> Whoa!

410
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,107
>> There's five huge ones right
there.

411
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,778
>> We found a bubbling brook,
and there was a pool there with

412
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,531
pretty good-sized shrimp, maybe,
you know, three-to-four-inch

413
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,117
size shrimp.
Neleh decided it would be nice

414
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,914
to try and catch some shrimps.
>> Oh, wow, there's a nice one.

415
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:45,710
>> Dang it!
>> Sarah basically just sat on

416
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,922
the shore the whole time
scratching her legs, and really

417
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,259
not doing much of anything to
help with the food situation.

418
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,010
>> I'll see you guys in a little
bit.

419
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,929
>> All right. Be careful.
>> See you.

420
00:25:56,012 --> 00:26:00,350
>> Sarah decided that she was
getting eaten pretty bad by the

421
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:04,729
no-nos, so she decided she
wanted to leave and head on back

422
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,482
to camp.
We truly didn't care, she wasn't

423
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,318
doing anything, anyway.
>> I have lost an extreme amount

424
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,321
of weight, and I'm getting very
weak and the bug bites are

425
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,491
driving me absolutely insane.
I thought I was going to come

426
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,160
back to camp and cut my legs off
with a machete.

427
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,871
>> Gina, can you hear me?
>> Sarah's lost.

428
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,125
>> How far up here is the trail?
Do you remember?

429
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,502
>> I don't even know where
you're at.

430
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:31,464
Sarah basically just couldn't
find her way back, so she came

431
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,675
back.
>> Apparently, I'm not going

432
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,011
anywhere.
>> Sarah likes to sit back.

433
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:40,015
I think that's probably her
thing-- she doesn't participate.

434
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,685
But Neleh, and Paschal and
obviously Gina and myself are

435
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,897
willing to explore and get some
food other than just plucking it

436
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,691
off a tree.
>> Yes!

437
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,359
>> Got another one?
>> Two.

438
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,363
>> She got two nice ones.
(squeals)

439
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,552
>> Guys, how is it?
>> Great, thank you.

440
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,387
>> Want a little bit more?
>> Yeah.

441
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,390
Thank you so much.
>> You're welcome.

442
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:33,026
>> Thank you, Tammy.
>> I'm telling you, as your

443
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,362
friend, man, they're already
five strong.

444
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,531
And their group... their group
is real tight, I mean...

445
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,951
What we can do is win the next
challenges and ensure that we

446
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,580
stay here, but me you and V are
going to get picked off one by

447
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,414
one, anyway.
>> Whoo!

448
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,750
>> These five have been here
before us.

449
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,920
They're a strong knit group,
we're going to be the first to

450
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,423
go if they have to vote anyway.
So there's nothing you can do to

451
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,052
try to prove yourself.
And if you don't kiss butt, like

452
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,721
I don't plan to do, then you
just know that your butt is

453
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,306
next.
If I'm the next one voted off,

454
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,225
so be it.
But I tell you, I can't hold my

455
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,394
mouth for too long.
They are definitely going to

456
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,146
know where Sean is coming from.
We're not going to overexert

457
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,899
ourselves knowing we're coming
into a situation where we may

458
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,984
get voted off anyway.
We're not trying to prove

459
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,903
nothing.
We're trying to fit in, have fun

460
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,114
while we do it.
And whatever game y'all five got

461
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,782
going...
>> Listen, listen, I want you

462
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,326
to, I want you to... I mean,
you're going to think what

463
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,829
you're going to think.
>> I hear you, but the thing is,

464
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,415
we're not going to run around
here like slaves to prove

465
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,750
anything to anybody.
That's why we're going to rest

466
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,752
when we want to rest.
Y'all are Clydesdales.

467
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,588
Every last one of you all are
getting up every five seconds...

468
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:39,134
(panting): "Yeah, I'm going to
go 50-mile hiking.

469
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,803
Okay, let's cut up some coconut
and let's cut this up."

470
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,930
Let's sit our butts down and
freaking relax!

471
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,141
Man, I'm getting tired of this
working around.

472
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,810
I'm a grown man out here.
I'm going to be real with you.

473
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,979
>> I want you to be real...
>> I didn't come out here for

474
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,772
all of this.
I'm getting tired of this bull.

475
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,150
We're not tip toeing around a
mother out here, and I'm coming

476
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,317
out my shell, telling you right
now.

477
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,820
The bottom line, if y'all are
going to vote us off, vote us

478
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:12,500
off.
>> What do you think about all

479
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,462
this, V.?
>> It's too much damn drama for

480
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,630
me.
You know, I'm down with you

481
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,757
guys.
I'm going to be with you

482
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,803
regardless, you know that.
But as far as the chitchat and

483
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,556
the drama, bump that.
I ain't with it.

484
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:31,186
Stay drama-free, and that's the
way to be.

485
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,022
You know, when the drama starts,
I walk away.

486
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,525
If my name's not in it, then I'm
not in it.

487
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,869
>> So, this challenge thing.
Oh, God.

488
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:53,583
It's gonna be interesting.
Oh, I just love tree mail.

489
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,588
"Look for the pattern or you
may be leaving.

490
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,508
The key to victory is all in
the weaving.

491
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,427
You need to be wary of the time
you're using.

492
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,263
If you take too long, eviction
is looming."

493
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,350
Oh, God, thank God my weaving
skills are good.

494
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:14,395
How about you?
>> I know, good.

495
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,066
>> Oh...
>> Sarah...

496
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,901
>> Sarah.
>> We got tree mail.

497
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,779
>> What's it say?
>> You want to come up here?

498
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,406
>> I think Rotu is going to do
something.

499
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,910
I think they'll back off.
If they don't like the people

500
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,288
that came over, I can see that
tribe backing off on a

501
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,749
challenge.
Just taking it slower, maybe

502
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:38,670
allowing us to win, just so they
have the opportunity to vote

503
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,631
somebody off.
>> One, two, three, Maraamu!

504
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:46,219
>> That just sounds weird.
>> It does sound weird.

505
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,278
>> PROBST: Okay.
First things first.

506
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:10,451
Give it up, Gabe.
New tribes, maybe new energy

507
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,455
around the immunity idol, or
maybe it goes back home with

508
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,042
Rotu once again.
Okay, today's immunity challenge

509
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,671
is all about the weaving.
Each of you have a woven

510
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,757
tapestry that is scrambled, it's
very simple.

511
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,802
The first tribe to unscramble it
correctly wins immunity,

512
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:31,264
guarantees themselves three more
days on the island, and you're

513
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,182
one step closer to a million
bucks.

514
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,102
Losing tribe, Tribal Council
tonight with me.

515
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,980
For somebody, life on the island
will be over.

516
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,859
Big enough stakes, I'm sure.
Rotu, you need to sit out three

517
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,486
members.
Sean, John, Rob.

518
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,614
All right, you guys are sitting
out.

519
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:53,620
Take your spots, and we'll go.
Survivors ready!

520
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,331
Go!
>> It's oriented, it's

521
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,999
oriented...
Pull back around the bottom.

522
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,001
Pull back around the bottom.
Pull your way.

523
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,337
Go the other way, the other
direction.

524
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,380
That's it.
That's the bottom piece, three

525
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,257
dashes, three dashes on the
bottom.

526
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,843
>> Three dashes...
>> Keep going, keep going, this

527
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,304
way, this is it.
>> Good.

528
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,097
>> Okay?
>> We got to do this one.

529
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,059
>> Which way, that way?
>> Let's start with the eyeball.

530
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,394
>> We need to kind of figure out
the design.

531
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,688
>> Okay, so pull and push on
that eyeball.

532
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,482
>> Here's the eyeball, right
here.

533
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,650
>> Okay.
>> Look.

534
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,485
>> Yeah, but I think we should
be working on this quadrant.

535
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,861
>> That matched, babe.
>> No, it didn't.

536
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,404
>> Yeah, it did.
The eyeballs were perfect.

537
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,990
>> Pull, pull, pull!
>> Okay, now line up this one.

538
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,076
>> Go that way, go that way
first and see what we got.

539
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,203
>> It's going to line up the
other side, right there.

540
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,829
>> Yep, yep, yep!
>> Let's get this one.

541
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,207
>> Need the black line, so
there.

542
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,917
Okay, there.
Now that one on the end.

543
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,710
>> Yeah, we're looking for three
lines.

544
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,879
>> Here they come.
>> Easy, easy, easy, easy.

545
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,589
>> You got it, you got it.
It's cool.

546
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,175
>> This is it right here.
Lined up with the eye right

547
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,595
here, okay.
>> That's it. That's it.

548
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,889
>> Keep on moving down.
>> You guys just have to keep

549
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,684
working. I, you know...
We're looking for the eyeballs.

550
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,269
>> The top is supposed to be
striped, just like that.

551
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,730
>> Okay, so this is the top, we
got eyeballs here.

552
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,525
See this little grid pattern?
>> Here's the actual eyeball.

553
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,193
Right.
>> There's lots of eyeballs.

554
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,570
>> Yep. Okay, work with that
eyeball right there.

555
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,073
Those aren't lining up.
>> This one is the top of the

556
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,075
eyeball right here.
This one doesn't fit.

557
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,160
>> The eyeball should be at the
top.

558
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,871
>> Maybe it's the middle.
>> I think it should go the

559
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,958
other way.
>> Up and down we're good.

560
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,876
Tammy.
>> We're looking for this block

561
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,878
right here.
>> All right, we'll line this

562
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,715
up-- keep going, keep going.
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

563
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,509
There, that's the piece.
That's it, all right, excellent.

564
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,594
>> We're going this way now.
>> Horizontal.

565
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,389
All right, line up the very
top one, work on the very top

566
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,057
one.
Finish those eyes at the top.

567
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,601
Okay, now do the next one down.
>> Yeah, pull to you.

568
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,311
>> That's it, that's it.
That's it.

569
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,230
>> I think it should go the
other way.

570
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,941
>> Back the other way?
>> Go back and see what it looks

571
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,818
like.
>> Yeah, there is stripes at the

572
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,778
bottom.
>> You guys need to be working,

573
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,280
too.
I think we need to be both

574
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,158
pulling and pushing, come on.
I think this way is kind of

575
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,951
strange.
Here, what about this one?

576
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,245
>> Okay, that's good, we're
matched over here.

577
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,540
>> But then this doesn't look...
>> Okay, work with that eyeball

578
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,625
right there.
I think this is matched right

579
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,919
here.
>> That's the center piece, all

580
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,464
right, and now this one to fix.
Give me slack.

581
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,465
>> Wait.
>> Here it comes.

582
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,759
>> Here it comes.
>> Okay, keep going, keep going.

583
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,802
That side piece.
>> Right there, where you are.

584
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,429
>> Back corner, right there.
>> Yeah.

585
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,639
>> Try it through till you line
that piece up again.

586
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,975
>> Pull.
>> Here it comes, here it comes.

587
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:23,853
>> Keep pulling, pull.
Slow, slow, slow. That's it.

588
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,147
>> That's it.
>> That's it right there.

589
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,857
>> Rotu!
>> PROBST: Rotu.

590
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,821
(cheering)
>> All right!

591
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,158
>> PROBST: Rotu, nice job once
again.

592
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,993
>> Yeah, baby!
>> PROBST: She's never felt that

593
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,996
before.
(cheering)

594
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,624
Maraamu, Tribal Council.
For three of you, that'll be a

595
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,667
new experience.
Not a pleasant one, I assure

596
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,377
you.
You guys can head straight back

597
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:54,175
out this way.
(cheering)

598
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:16,531
>> Oh!
>> Touche!

599
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,326
>> You know, Rotu just has this
heat on their breath that

600
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,371
they... (growling)
You know, they were just...

601
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:27,208
"We're going to get it."
And that's the way they do their

602
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,085
challenges.
Just with that fierce

603
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,838
determination.
>> Definitely doesn't feel good

604
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,007
to lose, that's for sure.
As usual, Maraamu is heading

605
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,261
back to Tribal Council tonight.
This is our fourth time.

606
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,222
I'm kind of used to it.
But I still hate it.

607
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,182
I'm not looking forward to it,
at all.

608
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:47,979
And it's a little unnerving,
because we are outnumbered.

609
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,568
Sarah, I think, has kind of
pretty much given up.

610
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,237
I think she probably knows that
she's going to go.

611
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,574
I don't know that, 'cause the
type of person she is, she might

612
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,285
not have a clue.
>> I'm definitely not giving up,

613
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,580
but it's so hard to say with the
five people we have now who's

614
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,416
going to go, because we're all
getting along so good.

615
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,752
The one vote that I probably
will have will be for Kathy, and

616
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,381
it's because she's been very
overbearing and motherly to me.

617
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,967
Even though that may just be her
personality, I don't know how

618
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,722
long I could stand that.
>> Fire's done.

619
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,641
>> Warm... it's hot in here.
>> Kathy, she's a hard-working

620
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,310
woman.
She is very energetic, very

621
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,645
outgoing, I mean, she's out here
for the kill.

622
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,856
You know, she just wants to get
things done.

623
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,317
In the beginning of our
challenge, she was kind of

624
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,236
barking out orders and she's
kind of really uptight about

625
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,405
everything.
She wants it done here and now.

626
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,450
Go get the fire started, and she
kind of like, almost panics.

627
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,453
You know, so it kind of puts the
rest of us into this panic

628
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,330
stage.
>> That's fine, I just feel

629
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,457
better now. (chuckles)
>> No problem.

630
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,210
>> And who knows? I mean, I was
walking today saying, "Kath, you

631
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:58,382
just never know, you know?
You might get voted off."

632
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,627
>> PROBST: Neleh and Paschal and
Kathy, because this is your

633
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,712
first Tribal Council, we have a
little ritual.

634
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,131
Behind each of you is a
personalized tribal torch.

635
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,426
Why don't you go ahead and grab
it, approach the flame and light

636
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:48,265
it up.
The reason for the ritual?

637
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,352
At Tribal Council, fire
represents your life in this

638
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,354
game.
So you'll take these torches

639
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,066
back with you to camp and you'll
bring them to all future Tribal

640
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,360
Councils.
As long as you have fire,

641
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,738
you remain on the island.
When your fire is gone, so are

642
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,074
you.
As will be the case tonight for

643
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:08,577
one of the five of you.
A lot has changed in the last

644
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,414
couple days.
Paschal, what was your reaction

645
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,083
to the switch?
>> Well, initially I was kind of

646
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,335
shocked, because I wasn't
prepared for it.

647
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,547
After we got back it was like
being thrown in a briar patch.

648
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,049
They like taking care of an old
man pretty well.

649
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,468
>> PROBST: So it worked out all
right for you?

650
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,054
>> Worked out great.
>> PROBST: Gina, how about you?

651
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,765
Nothing changed in terms of
tribe name, but certainly tribe

652
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,058
members.
>> It was awesome, it was

653
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,228
probably one of the better days
that I've had out here, to be

654
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,522
honest with you.
>> PROBST: Do you think you were

655
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,442
in danger of being voted out if
the tribe Maraamu had remained

656
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,569
the same?
>> I would have been the next to

657
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,113
go if the tribe had stayed the
same, definitely.

658
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,033
>> PROBST: So you're not missing
the old tribe members?

659
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,410
>> Not really.
>> PROBST: Kathy, what was your

660
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,747
reaction as people were pulling
one buff out and putting a new

661
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,749
one on?
>> I was not happy, you know, I

662
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,251
was disappointed.
I mean, Rotu's a strong team.

663
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,712
I'm a competitor, I-I just
couldn't believe it.

664
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,089
I mean, the range of emotions
were just vast.

665
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,091
Angry, sad.
Oh, my God, what's going to

666
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,259
happen next?
I had no idea.

667
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:08,471
So it was just, you know,
pulling the rug right out from

668
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,556
under me.
>> PROBST: Do you feel like

669
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,851
you're with the losers now?
>> I don't feel like it's the

670
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,770
losers.
I just think it's a new era

671
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,064
almost.
So right now we're just enjoying

672
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,442
ourselves and trying to regain
some new spirit for the next

673
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,568
challenges.
>> PROBST: Neleh?

674
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,613
What was your reaction?
>> I had a tough time at first,

675
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,491
especially, I mean, when I
flipped over my log, you know, I

676
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,494
saw two of our really strong
tribe members go onto the green

677
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,287
mat and I knew I to walk to
yellow.

678
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,956
I was just really bummed out.
I just sat there waiting

679
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,001
patiently, hoping that some more
of the, you know, the people

680
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,128
would come over.
I just didn't know what to

681
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,756
expect, so I was very, very,
disappointed at first.

682
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,675
>> PROBST: Has that changed?
>> Yeah, I mean, once I got

683
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,553
there, it's beautiful.
The white sand beach is amazing

684
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,514
there.
I got to meet some new people,

685
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,350
which was really nice.
So every day things are getting

686
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,894
better and better.
>> PROBST: How about for you,

687
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,480
Sarah-- reaction?
>> It was definitely a shocker.

688
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,650
It was a good thing, though.
I was glad to get to know some

689
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,652
new people, new faces, new
energy.

690
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,530
It's been a good thing, though.
>> PROBST: Okay, it's time to

691
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,408
vote.
Kathy, you're first.

692
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,844
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

693
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,608
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

694
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,943
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area

695
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:32,531
immediately.
I'll read the votes.

696
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:42,958
First vote, Sarah.
Kathy.

697
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:53,552
Sarah.
Sarah.

698
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,930
That's a majority vote, no need
to read the last vote.

699
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,850
Sarah, you need to bring me your
torch.

700
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:17,952
Sarah, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

701
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:26,752
>> Thanks.
>> This game is unpredictable.

702
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,838
To stay in it you have to adapt.
I give you guys credit for doing

703
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,258
that.
You may be a new tribe, but you

704
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,094
are a tribe.
You guys can take your torches

705
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:39,390
and head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

706
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:54,071
Stay tuned for scenes from our
next episode.

707
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,118
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor,</i> Maraamu finds a new

708
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,953
spirit.
>> It's the first time I felt as

709
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,162
though I had been on a real
team.

710
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,040
>> PROBST: At Rotu, suspicion
and doubt cause the love tribe

711
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,667
to fracture.
>> Are we staying tight?

712
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,836
Is that the deal?
Are we trying to put Rotu back

713
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,546
together?
>> PROBST: And one tribe will

714
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,464
have a chance to devastate the
competition.

715
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,883
The winning tribe gets to
raid the losing tribe's camp.

716
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:22,516
>> Wow.
>> I'm getting kind of emotional

717
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,351
right now, which I didn't think
I would do.

718
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,355
But I'm excited for the people
that get to go back and finish

719
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,692
the game and do what they have
been doing very well.

720
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,529
And I hope that my original
seven other teammates, Rob and

721
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:39,658
Sean and V and Gina, especially,
do very, very, well, and I hope

722
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,536
they're having a great time.
