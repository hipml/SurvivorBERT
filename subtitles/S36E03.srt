1
00:00:01,675 --> 00:00:04,436
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:08,817
On Ghost Island, 
Jacob was the first visitor

3
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:12,900
to uncover the graveyard 
of past bad decisions.

4
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:16,991
And he bequeathed the 
Cursed Heir Boon to Morgan.

5
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:20,195
It's the Heir's Advantage! 
See, I touch it!

6
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:22,130
At the Naviti,

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,378
Domenick used his fake idol 
to gain trust.

8
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:27,869
Lily. That's crazy.

9
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:30,914
But it backfired. 
I do not trust.

10
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:32,974
Something is wrong in there.

11
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:36,111
The Malolo tribe 
had to go to the council.

12
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,179
And James was threatened.

13
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,482
I caused us to lose. 
I screwed up.

14
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:42,820
But a surprise elimination was 
brewing.

15
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:44,370
We need to get Jacob out.

16
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:46,669
At the council,

17
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:49,090
James received votes.

18
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:50,764
But Jacob was eliminated.

19
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:52,439
Jacob, the tribe has spoken.

20
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:57,261
There are 18 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,623
After the counseling, 
I feel a bit drained.

22
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,579
It's been a roller coaster ride 
for my little heart and me.

23
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:28,363
It was a good plan. 
Glad it worked.

24
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,975
James, don't blame me.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,375
Yeah. 
I will try.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,737
Tonight I got two votes.

27
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:38,100
I deserved to be the second target.

28
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,909
Growing up in a 
Korean-American family

29
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,345
taught me to accept my failures.

30
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:47,282
But I'm happy to be here, 
ready to fight.

31
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:50,485
It's time to win. 
I'm tired of losing.

32
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:58,259
Over here, everyone!

33
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:07,029
Naviti, 
discover the new Malolo tribe.

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,472
Jacob was eliminated 
at the last council.

35
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,875
And here is Donathan, 
back from Ghost Island.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,343
Over here, Donathan!

37
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,869
Welcome !

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,075
Donathan also discovers 
the new Malolo tribe.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,411
Welcome. How are you ? 
What's new ?

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,004
Libby, after two ordeals, 
you have lost two limbs.

41
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,675
Where is this tribe in the game?

42
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:39,475
We are always united and positive

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,437
We will still become

44
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,570
the best tribe ever.

45
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,842
Bradley, where are the Naviti?

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,944
I believe we are strong.

47
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:51,946
We get on very well.

48
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:53,827
It's a tight-knit group.

49
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,216
So it looks like the two tribes

50
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:58,486
feel very good.

51
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:02,090
Now is the perfect time

52
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,505
for a change.

53
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,007
Throw away all your bandanas!

54
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,862
We change the tribes.

55
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,690
It was nice, friends.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,910
Angela, how do you feel, 
before we changed?

57
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,755
A little anxious, like 
a separated family. It's sad.

58
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,869
Are you moved?

59
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,375
I do not know. I love them.

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,850
I did two deployments 
with the army.

61
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:35,437
We forge strong and lasting bonds 
in a very short time.

62
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:38,600
For me, it's exactly the same.

63
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:42,263
So this mix 
makes me very nervous.

64
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:44,730
Fine, let's go!

65
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:46,300
Lord !

66
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Do not open them yet.

67
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
I am rather in a position of strength.

68
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,977
So I'm freaking out a bit.

69
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,946
But I knew having the power 
wouldn't last.

70
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,416
But you have to ride the waves. 
There's a wave, ride it!

71
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:02,862
There are two left.

72
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,496
Michael will have the last.

73
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,597
Destiny.

74
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:11,095
Good. Reveal all 
your new bandanas.

75
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:17,178
Greet your new tribe.

76
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,175
What have you got, Dom? 
Purple.

77
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,539
I'm worried, because I still have 
to deal with Chris in this tribe.

78
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:28,450
So it's crucial that I 
connect with everyone

79
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:31,145
in order to get it out.

80
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:34,515
Violets, you are Naviti. 
Go to the purple carpet.

81
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:38,075
Les Oranges, you are Malolo. 
Go to the orange mat.

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,975
Je suis Rest. 
Relax.

83
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Go for it.

84
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:45,026
Glad to finally talk to you! 
But yes !

85
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,333
Good. In the new Naviti tribe,

86
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,471
quatre ex-Malolo :

87
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:58,134
Donathan, Libby, Laurel and James.

88
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,475
And five ex-Navitis:

89
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,475
How are you feeling, Morgan? 
Good.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,075
I love purple.

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,100
We have a living room, comfort... 
I feel very good.

92
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:17,575
And you are in the majority. 
Absolutely.

93
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,927
Good. In the new Malolo tribe,

94
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:22,558
also four ex-Malolo:

95
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,668
Brendan and Michael.

96
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,375
And five ex-Navitis:

97
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:33,475
Kellyn, Bradley et Chelsea.

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,648
Kellyn. 
Does a part of you wonder

99
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:38,875
what will happen to the five Naviti?

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,782
"Can we stick together?"

101
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:42,432
uh well...

102
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:44,618
Jeff, I smell the Violets,

103
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,775
but at the same time, 
things change,

104
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,122
we never know.

105
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,749
I am excited 
to meet new people,

106
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,706
to open new 
treasure boxes full of love.

107
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,665
Good. Malolo, Naviti, 
take your things, let's go!

108
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,442
The game has changed again.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,875
Apparently, 
I should be working with the Malolos.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,979
But the Naviti are in the majority.

111
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,475
My plan 
is for us to stay together.

112
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,592
'Cause that would be really awful

113
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:16,300
to release these Malolo 
one after the other.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,302
Welcome !

115
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:35,775
Rather nice.

116
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,275
Is it different from your side? 
Yeah.

117
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,075
Without the pillows, 
hammocks and all.

118
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:44,551
The majority 
is essential in this game.

119
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:47,014
Around me, 
I had my four friends

120
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:49,650
of the old Naviti. I was delighted.

121
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:51,275
It's ideal for me.

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,111
So there, I'm 
a happy, bubbly candy cane.

123
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:56,324
Banana.

124
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:57,569
Alright, here...

125
00:06:57,694 --> 00:07:00,504
You know how it is. 
In the beginning, we do what we can.

126
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:03,475
We must have done 
half the stuff wrong.

127
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,760
The shelter is large.

128
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:06,534
But there are plenty of bumps.

129
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:10,575
Going from Naviti to Malolo 
was a bit of a shock for us.

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,939
Car l'abri...

131
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,377
...is just part 
of the giant mess that is this camp.

132
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:19,541
It's like seeing your friends baby

133
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,528
that they find so cute, 
the love of their life,

134
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,952
But this baby is ugly!

135
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,988
What happened here?!

136
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,961
It is important to appreciate 
the beauty of the place.

137
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,480
Like... 
We get lost in what we do.

138
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:36,475
It's easier at Camp Naviti.

139
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,035
Here, it's rotten, in comparison.

140
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,475
Looks like a meadow.

141
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,973
What surprised me with the Naviti,

142
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:48,904
it's that they 
only complained about the conditions

143
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,429
since their arrival.

144
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,606
Bradley, in particular.

145
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,049
He constantly complains, 
it's unbelievable.

146
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,383
It's Survivor, it's supposed to be hard.

147
00:07:57,508 --> 00:08:00,157
I don't understand 
what upsets them.

148
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,675
As a bonus, we are in the minority, 4 5.

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,158
All in all, 
not a great mix for me.

150
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,375
Welcome to Naviti!

151
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,107
Welcome to the house !

152
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,035
Here is the living room.

153
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:25,375
Wow, yeah!

154
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,175
That's great ! 
And how !

155
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,484
Really cool ! 
It's a little cold here at night.

156
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:35,275
Let's go in the bedroom. 
We put our comforts here.

157
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,625
We didn't have tools like you, 
so...

158
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,319
And there, the hearth for the night. 
Really ?!

159
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:44,175
I was sawed arriving at Naviti.

160
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,435
They assured. They have two homes,

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,975
good shelter,

162
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,874
and of course, the most beautiful view 
I have seen in my life.

163
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,110
A priori, I doubt 
that this new tribe

164
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,475
go to the council anytime soon.

165
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,875
We look strong! 
Yeah, really!

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,075
We have the advantage, 5 4, 
but it's much more complex than that.

167
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:08,975
Because with three of the five, 
I hardly had any ties.

168
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:12,793
And Dom has an idol, 
which terrifies me.

169
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,834
I have to blow her up.

170
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,734
What will happen, in your opinion?

171
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,675
We have the majority. 
No reason to deviate from it.

172
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,660
But start thinking 
with your military instinct,

173
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,223
not with your heart.

174
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:28,675
Yeah. 
OK ?

175
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,978
I would follow Wendell. 
If you want to win,

176
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:33,567
think like that. 
I'm super serious.

177
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:37,200
I'll tell you something. 
Dom told me he has the idol.

178
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:40,321
He searched for a long time. He has it? 
He has it.

179
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,300
We will only survive 
by acting together.

180
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:46,175
If I'm alone, we're screwed.

181
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,431
I believe the information 
Chris gave me on Domenick.

182
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,575
After this mixture, 
we must change strategy.

183
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,002
We have to get Dom out.

184
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:58,775
I follow the movement, but I get 
a little stuck on Chris's stories.

185
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,242
Because he is a manipulator.

186
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,639
He talks to people, not with.

187
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:07,175
He was giving me orders: 
"Do this, don't deviate."

188
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,018
And even though the army got me used 
to guys barking orders,

189
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,843
I don't like 
this kind of confrontation at all.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,752
Where are you, level cocos?

191
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,675
I have a question for you.

192
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,075
The four, are you united?

193
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,391
Domenick probably has the idol.

194
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,875
Are you sure ? 
Yes.

195
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:32,266
We have to take it out. 
Find a way.

196
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:34,669
He will try 
to rally everyone.

197
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:37,557
He will do it. 
You're from New York, you understand.

198
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:40,547
He's a New Yorker. 
I've watched him from the start.

199
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:44,218
Chris started 
talking about Domenick having an idol

200
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,075
and we have to get it out.

201
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,288
And I was...

202
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:50,275
"Wow! Welcome to Naviti!"

203
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:52,613
We have to. 
We have to get there.

204
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,262
Seriously...

205
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:57,127
Let's do it! 
Absolutely.

206
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,119
Chris has a strong character, 
so when he talks to me,

207
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,675
I have to nod and smile,

208
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,772
act like i'm a girl

209
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:08,731
which he could take advantage 
of and use the vote.

210
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:10,637
On the way back, we play it cool.

211
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:13,200
I'll play dumb, 
but I won't be.

212
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:33,466
This is exceptional. 
I say.

213
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:35,253
Look how beautiful it is!

214
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,535
Impossible to get tired of it.

215
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:40,809
We freeze.

216
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,378
I want to go back to Naviti.

217
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,915
Yours is dirt.

218
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:49,303
We have sand everywhere.

219
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:53,088
I feel dirty and grimy. 
My God !

220
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:57,258
The Naviti hate our camp. 
A bunch of moaners!

221
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:01,062
But I find myself in the minority 
in this tribe.

222
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:03,035
I have to find a loophole.

223
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:07,235
Sometimes 
this game is a matter of luck.

224
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,735
But none of us 
will betray the Violets.

225
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:14,610
So it sucks for you, 
being at 5 4.

226
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,609
At the bottom of the ladder, it is necessary 
to fight, to multiply the contacts.

227
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:21,316
It's frustrating, 
because chance can make you

228
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,810
suddenly go 
from the summit to the depths.

229
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,610
Let's not give up! 
No.

230
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,625
With Steph, 
we have to find an idol,

231
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,424
to change the balance of power.

232
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,593
Come on, let's run! Come !

233
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:35,463
We took off like rockets 
in the woods.

234
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,657
Return that!

235
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:38,566
Digging under every tree...

236
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:39,710
Stands guard !

237
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,866
Every rock, pebble... 
Something?

238
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,905
Every branch, near the well,

239
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,132
in the mail...

240
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:48,110
Lord ! These things 
are going to jump out at me!

241
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,610
We put our hands in trunks 
covered with termites and ants.

242
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:52,534
Nothing.

243
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:57,412
We did everything 
to find an idol.

244
00:12:57,813 --> 00:12:59,199
You want to take me out?

245
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:01,790
I will only come out 
screaming and thrashing.

246
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,335
I will do everything to stay in the game.

247
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,028
We should be quiet.

248
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,035
It couldn't have turned out better.

249
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:11,871
And they are entertaining. 
While we eliminate them!

250
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,733
I think she is there.

251
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:16,035
There's a real idol somewhere.

252
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,110
More than ever, the four Malolo 
want to find an idol.

253
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:24,445
So no one should be surprised 
that we're looking for one.

254
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,735
There must be a clue 
or something.

255
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:37,135
Oh my God !

256
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:42,932
I watch.

257
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,860
We found the idol.

258
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:46,235
We got it, mate.

259
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,035
I'm so happy. 
I found an idol.

260
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:53,348
It's a big Survivor dream 
come true.

261
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:56,436
“Congratulations, you have found 
the Hidden Immunity Idol.

262
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,704
This is one 
of the true idols that James..."

263
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:01,435
It's the ghost!

264
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:05,910
This is the original James idol,

265
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:08,535
of Survivor China, in 2007,

266
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,874
when he came out having two.

267
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:15,510
She decorated the entrance to their camp.

268
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:18,110
Nobody suspected 
that it was an idol.

269
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,569
He ripped it off, and indeed...

270
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:22,210
An idol.

271
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:23,972
I have two idols!

272
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:27,535
"By day 30, James was 
in a strong position.

273
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:31,412
He had a close-knit covenant of five 
and two idols.

274
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,358
Of this combination of powers,

275
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,822
he got 
a false sense of security.

276
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:39,520
His allies eliminated him, 
his two idols in his pocket.

277
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,066
Tenth person eliminated 
and fourth member of the jury:

278
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:47,262
"James is the only one in Survivor 
to have dated two idols."

279
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:50,510
"The question is: 
can you reverse the curse?"

280
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:54,318
When I was eight years old, the first season 
I saw was Survivor China.

281
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:56,481
James was one of my favorites.

282
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:58,531
I saw him go out with his idols.

283
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,644
Being here eleven years later, 
with the real idol in hand,

284
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:06,179
and have a chance 
to reverse this curse,

285
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:09,317
to change his legacy, 
it's incredible.

286
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,535
It is enormous. 
That's exactly what we were looking for.

287
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,310
This little rascal! 
[???]

288
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:27,835
We have work.

289
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,610
I'm afraid Chris will betray us 
before we knock him out.

290
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:34,709
And he'll take Angela. 
They are close.

291
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,335
Libby. I like it.

292
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,535
Chris is already working on them.

293
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:42,210
We must therefore rally them all.

294
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,914
Not just one or two. The fourth. 
Yup.

295
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:50,510
The easiest 
would be to stay at five.

296
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,597
At least for a vote.

297
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:57,710
But I feel 
like Chris doesn't want that,

298
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:01,010
because he does not have 
a good contact with Dom.

299
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:03,771
So we might have to target Chris.

300
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,787
People are starting 
to get a little paranoid,

301
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:11,913
but you have nothing to worry about right 
now.

302
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,135
I love you, I'm on your side.

303
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:17,114
I was glad you were shooting purple.

304
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,790
Me too ! 
Wooden cross, iron cross!

305
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:22,190
Catholic girls, 
we gotta stick together.

306
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,110
OK.

307
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:25,675
I knew right away 
it would fit with Morgan.

308
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,844
She was super open and friendly.

309
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:31,199
We are two Catholics, 
so I feel closer to her

310
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,267
than others of the tribe.

311
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,367
I'm not sure 
that the five Naviti...

312
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:38,810
... are welded.

313
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:42,510
What's good when people come to you, 
want to trust you,

314
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,810
is that you can 
choose your alliance,

315
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:48,910
and I feel really good about Morgan.

316
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:51,310
We can work together, we understand each other.

317
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:53,955
I finally feel 
like I have a real ally.

318
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:57,217
I don't think 
you need to worry.

319
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,277
Over here, everyone!

320
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,539
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

321
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:39,600
First of all, Angela, I'm taking her back.

322
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:48,003
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

323
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,078
Today you will cross 
a series of sloping walls

324
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:55,283
up to a sand pit, 
where you'll dig up a ladder.

325
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:58,029
You will climb there, 
retrieve a rope.

326
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:02,003
With the rope you will reach 
the top of a high tower

327
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:04,357
where you will solve a puzzle.

328
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:09,176
The first tribe to succeed 
wins immunity,

329
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,723
is shielded from the board.

330
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,978
The losers: someone will be 
the third person eliminated.

331
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:16,425
Plus, you're playing 
for a reward.

332
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:18,378
Yeah ! 
Yeah !

333
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:20,586
A single

334
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:21,976
small tarp.

335
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:25,878
It will protect you 
from rain and sun.

336
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:29,551
And the winners send 
one of the losers to Ghost Island.

337
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,216
Still a lot of issues. 
A minute of organization

338
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:33,624
and we get to it.

339
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:35,503
Let's go!

340
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,662
Well, on and go!

341
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,778
For immunity and reward!

342
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,503
Survivors, ready?

343
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:57,903
Chris and Sebastian begin.

344
00:18:58,381 --> 00:18:59,503
They pass.

345
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:05,532
Brendan just passes. 
Bradley passes.

346
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:09,603
James falls and has to start over. 
Desire too.

347
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,778
This is Donathan. Can it get there?

348
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,633
Angela has to start over.

349
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:20,778
All the Malolo women 
follow suit.

350
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:23,978
Michael passed. 
Desiree is still working there.

351
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:25,222
This is Morgan.

352
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:28,178
Libby is in trouble. 
She has to start over.

353
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:31,146
Desiree tries again. 
Is it the right one?

354
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,567
Yes it's good !

355
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,115
Start digging!

356
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:37,187
Domenick passed.

357
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:38,978
James tries again.

358
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:41,178
He passed. 
Here is Angela.

359
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,213
Angela is almost there.

360
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:45,676
Its good !

361
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:47,384
Its good !

362
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:49,103
Start digging!

363
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:53,402
You are now digging up 
a very large ladder.

364
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,919
Go on ! One two three !

365
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,786
The Malolos have taken out their ladder.

366
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,603
The Malolo lead!

367
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:05,701
The Naviti are always digging 
and slowing down,

368
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:07,516
at the start of the test.

369
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:11,678
The Naviti have their scale.

370
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:14,489
Use it 
to get someone up!

371
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,178
At 4 m 50 high!

372
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:18,560
That's the basis! 
That down! Put it down!

373
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:20,678
Malolo 
take a long time

374
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,003
to figure 
out how to use the ladder.

375
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:24,766
That end down!

376
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,576
We lift it and we turn it!

377
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:28,478
The Malolo lost the advantage.

378
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:29,765
It was right !

379
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:34,381
The Naviti have caught them!

380
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:37,778
Donathan climbs, 
Naviti leads now!

381
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,250
The great lead of the Oranges 
evaporated.

382
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,757
Chelsea climbs for Malolo.

383
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:45,921
Donathan throws the rope,

384
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,803
that's it ! Its good !

385
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:52,003
Chelsea are in trouble.

386
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:55,162
It's Chris, with the rope, 
for Naviti.

387
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:58,234
Attention ! 
Chelsea has it! Come back down!

388
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,575
Wait for her! 
Let her down!

389
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,803
The Malolo try to go up.

390
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:09,403
Sebastian 
will throw the rope for Malolo.

391
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,403
Chris! Its good !

392
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:14,903
Now you have to pull yourself up.

393
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:19,403
Sebastian succeeded!

394
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,101
Pull up!

395
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,278
Him first!

396
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:24,178
It's neck and neck!

397
00:21:24,454 --> 00:21:26,703
Wendell went up. 
Sebastian came up.

398
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,288
Laurel came up.

399
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:31,875
Everyone must go up!

400
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,907
Perfect equality!

401
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:37,005
Come on, Dom! Hold on!

402
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:41,747
Someone has to reach the top.

403
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,446
Sebastian tries. He fails.

404
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:47,273
Domenick gets help.

405
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:52,333
Sebastian gets help. 
Domenick and Sebastian are upstairs!

406
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,921
Who next? 
Go on !

407
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,158
Take my hand !

408
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:59,561
Sebastian 
brings up Bradley, then Desiree.

409
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:03,078
Domenick hoists Laurel! 
Teamwork!

410
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,077
Good collaboration 
in both tribes!

411
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:11,503
That's how it's done in Survivor! 
Like that !

412
00:22:11,628 --> 00:22:12,878
On the carpet !

413
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:15,276
Naviti, it's good, 
start the puzzle!

414
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:16,684
Where is the base?

415
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,378
[???] 
Come on, Mike!

416
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:21,503
Last man 
for the Malolo, it's good!

417
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,936
Start the puzzle!

418
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:28,657
All that adrenaline 
and energy to get here!

419
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:32,365
Now exhausted you gotta 
slow down and use your brains

420
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,944
to solve a complicated puzzle.

421
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,391
Slowly. We think.

422
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:39,368
It's Kellyn and Bradley for Malolo.

423
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:41,569
Wendell and Laurel for Naviti.

424
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:45,207
They first try to figure 
out what this puzzle is.

425
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:47,059
Small base, then bigger.

426
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:49,077
A tarp and immunity at stake.

427
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,962
The board and Ghost Island 
for the losers.

428
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:53,246
It's not that.

429
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:55,691
Wendell, look at me! 
On the table there!

430
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:56,484
To be ?

431
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:59,403
This is where the help of your comrades 
is invaluable.

432
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:03,592
Bradley and Kellyn have a play, 
if that's fair!

433
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:07,778
Another piece for Kellyn. 
If that's right!

434
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,799
Very good collaboration 
in the Malolo tribe.

435
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:12,430
Great ! 
It's good !

436
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:14,870
Wendell and Laurel lose ground.

437
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,805
Don't say that, Probst!

438
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,903
I say what I see.

439
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,594
New room 
for Bradley and Kellyn.

440
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,031
There, the big one, maybe.

441
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,090
One more for Bradley and Kellyn.

442
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:27,914
Wendell looks at them to understand.

443
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,155
Hey, Bradley, there, that room!

444
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:32,084
It's the big one, I think.

445
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:34,452
New room 
for Bradley and Kellyn.

446
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:36,903
It turns to correction!

447
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:39,718
The choice of who makes the puzzle

448
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:41,978
now turns out to be decisive.

449
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:44,232
Malolo has chosen very well,

450
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:46,703
clearly, with Kellyn and Bradley.

451
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:51,503
Malolo 
wins immunity and the reward!

452
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,609
They send Naviti to the council.

453
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,578
Malolo, congratulations.

454
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:03,047
A clear victory, from the outset,

455
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:05,153
with the new tribes.

456
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:08,278
No advice tonight. 
As a bonus, a nice tarp.

457
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,356
Come take your reward.

458
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:16,898
Good. Naviti. Tonight, advice,

459
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:19,678
where a third person 
will be eliminated from the game.

460
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:22,278
And someone 
's going to Ghost Island.

461
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:24,478
Malolo, you will decide who.

462
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:26,909
It has to be a unanimous decision.

463
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:30,178
Otherwise, the Naviti 
will shoot stones.

464
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:34,039
If you can't decide, 
chance will.

465
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:36,555
Does anyone 
object to sending Donathan there?

466
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,003
I oppose it.

467
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:41,160
So the stones. 
The stones.

468
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:42,524
The stones.

469
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,186
Explain to me, Bradley.

470
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:50,078
Why 
can't the group decide?

471
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:53,078
We are five 
from the old Naviti.

472
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:56,485
And we want 
to send a former Malolo there.

473
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:59,274
So it is logical that they oppose each other.

474
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:01,710
Normal. 
I would do the same in their place.

475
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:05,482
There are eight black stones

476
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:06,982
and a white one.

477
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,351
The white one goes to the Phantom Island.

478
00:25:10,103 --> 00:25:11,757
Pull one, don't look.

479
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,730
Keep it in the palm.

480
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,168
Everyone reach out.

481
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:29,303
Reveal !

482
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:35,064
Chris has the white stone.

483
00:25:35,189 --> 00:25:37,303
Chris will go to Ghost Island.

484
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:41,078
He can't be eliminated tonight, 
that's the good news.

485
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:43,860
The bad: you'll be 
left out of the social game

486
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:46,378
and will not be able 
to influence the elimination.

487
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,982
Pack your things, 
head to Ghost Island.

488
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,978
Good luck to you. 
See you later, Chris.

489
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,893
What a sloppiaud of Chris a de la veine.

490
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:58,649
I was really looking forward 
to eliminating him on the board tonight.

491
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:02,951
Malolo, no advice. 
Take your things, leave.

492
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:05,674
Enjoy your free evening.

493
00:26:06,124 --> 00:26:08,271
Naviti, see you tonight at the council.

494
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:10,304
Take your things, leave.

495
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:13,515
I'm totally freaking out!

496
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:17,677
This season is very much 
about the mistakes of the past.

497
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:20,268
It will be four against four 
tonight.

498
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:23,103
And I'm afraid we'll screw it up.

499
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:44,178
The ninth day 
has just turned into a nightmare.

500
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:48,316
We lose the race, 
I'm sent to Ghost Island...

501
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,054
And frankly, that scares me.

502
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,547
Tonight I'm missing a crucial piece of advice

503
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:57,892
whose outcome 
I greatly influenced.

504
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:03,030
I hope the plan remains 
to eliminate Dom by surprise.

505
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:06,667
But I'm scared.

506
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,463
Me away...

507
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:10,404
It might not happen.

508
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,334
Alright, here we go.

509
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:20,410
"No, not today. 
No game for you."

510
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,288
What a pity !

511
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:27,042
I was hoping that I could win an idol 
or some benefit.

512
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,506
Instead, 
I'm on my own.

513
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,323
Being here is not easy.

514
00:27:32,448 --> 00:27:35,023
I'm hungry, I miss my family...

515
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:38,920
That's crazy.

516
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:42,893
What the game does to you, mentally.

517
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,852
I expected this to happen to me 
at some point. It's just...

518
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:50,581
This is the first difficult day 
for me.

519
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:54,202
With the tribe, when I'm having trouble...

520
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,568
I have to hide it.

521
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,025
You have to be strong 
in the presence of others.

522
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:06,861
My mother has multiple sclerosis 
since before I was born.

523
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:08,645
My mother is my heroine.

524
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,194
More or less, I...

525
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,882
In my moments of weakness, 
I think of her.

526
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:16,747
She is the ultimate survivor.

527
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:18,913
She was diagnosed at age 27.

528
00:28:19,178 --> 00:28:22,960
Ten years ago, she was given 
2 months to live, and she's still alive.

529
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:25,392
Since then,

530
00:28:25,774 --> 00:28:27,303
I make myself a duty

531
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:29,342
to stay strong for her.

532
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:33,155
It helps me, 
when I'm in a tribe.

533
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,886
You have to do all that.

534
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:38,284
But I'm human, and...

535
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:40,928
Ghost Island offers me a chance

536
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,440
to evacuate all my negative energy,

537
00:28:43,614 --> 00:28:45,199
in order to start off on the right foot

538
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:47,768
and be like this again, 
for myself.

539
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:51,797
I didn't even know I was 
so exhausted.

540
00:28:53,592 --> 00:28:56,395
Thinking about my mom was awesome.

541
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,604
This link really helps me.

542
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,567
It's crucial that I refocus

543
00:29:02,162 --> 00:29:04,806
because it will improve my game 
for the future.

544
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,390
It sucks!

545
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,377
AIE Aie Aie !

546
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:32,540
Chris Noble must be happy 
with rice just for him,

547
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:34,460
a big bed for his big head.

548
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,652
What I see happening tonight

549
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:40,165
it's the four Malolos 
voting Domenick,

550
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,904
following Chris' plan.

551
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:44,058
I got a ton of sand 
in my panties

552
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:46,563
and the water looks good. 
I'm going to take a dip.

553
00:29:47,438 --> 00:29:51,208
I decided not to follow Chris, 
not to vote against my team.

554
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,098
I prefer loyalty

555
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:56,470
rather than being controlled 
and having no choice.

556
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:01,902
Have you thought about 
disaster scenarios for tonight?

557
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:04,728
No, but Chris talked to me.

558
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:06,385
He stays on Dom.

559
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:08,955
He said, "Follow the plan."

560
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,285
In other words: 
vote with the other four.

561
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,022
So they'll take out Dom 
and we'll be four against four.

562
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:19,026
I don't want to vote with them. 
I won't release one of ours.

563
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:23,264
I expect a tie 
and have to shoot the stones.

564
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:25,840
But I'm ready for it, 
for the old Naviti.

565
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:27,668
I stay with my team.

566
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:30,137
So who would you date?

567
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:33,541
So at worst they all vote Dom

568
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,268
and us for Libby,

569
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:37,784
we'll shoot the rocks 
or something.

570
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,206
We'll talk again, okay?

571
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:43,551
Angela wants 
the Naviti to stick together,

572
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,304
but it's a bit dodgy.

573
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,692
She is Chris' right-hand man.

574
00:30:47,817 --> 00:30:50,624
So for me, our "discussion" 
had little weight.

575
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:53,521
I don't want to pull the rocks 
for Angela, so...

576
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:56,537
The idea of ​​releasing it excites me.

577
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,840
I was ready to pull the trigger.

578
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:01,592
Chris is out of control.

579
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:03,323
He was supposed to go out tonight.

580
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:06,009
He's powerless 
if you pull out his right arm.

581
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,342
Cool. Angela. Boom.

582
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:10,711
He has Libby in his pocket. 
No.

583
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,002
Safe ? 
Yes. She is with us.

584
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,882
Good. Great. Easy.

585
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:17,754
Angela thinks Libby is going to leave.

586
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:19,978
But I have much more confidence 
in Libby

587
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:22,441
that I will never have in Angela.

588
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:25,594
Do you want to take Angela out?

589
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:29,120
With us, it would be 
a total and unanimous surprise.

590
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:31,632
We are a team. 
We are on your side

591
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:35,162
on your team, I swear.

592
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:38,139
The plan 
is to get Angela out now

593
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:40,441
to show them that we are with them.

594
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,409
We have to talk, it's important.

595
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,695
Pretend to be with them. 
Go for it !

596
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,633
I had in mind this fear 
that the four ex-Malolo

597
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:52,195
start thinking of me 
as a threat again.

598
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,094
So I could 
show the fake idol to the tribe

599
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:57,122
to gain some confidence.

600
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:01,242
Day one, day two: 
Chris was after me.

601
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:02,994
Third day, same.

602
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,566
And on the third or fourth day, 
he said to me:

603
00:32:05,816 --> 00:32:07,911
"Do you have an idol?" I answer no.

604
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:10,906
He said, "If I see that we can 
trust each other,

605
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,083
I'll leave you alone." 
So...

606
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:16,283
I found this purple fabric 
at a proof.

607
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:19,320
I took it away... 
A rotten string...

608
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:21,965
A mail scroll...

609
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:25,295
Oh my God ! 
My God !

610
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,578
So... It's a beautiful seashell.

611
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:30,829
I put it around my neck in front of him 
and everything. I showed it to him.

612
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:33,269
Yeah. 
But... It's worthless.

613
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:35,974
That's what he's been raving about 
since day one.

614
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:38,069
Eh ? So... How's it going between us?

615
00:32:38,194 --> 00:32:40,820
The Naviti 
want us to take Angela out. But...

616
00:32:40,945 --> 00:32:43,918
I almost see in Domenick 
a Russell Hantz 2.0.

617
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:46,774
I believe he is capable 
of lying to my face.

618
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,381
Count on me. 
OK.

619
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:51,312
He could very well 
have a real idol

620
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:54,548
and want to mislead 
us by showing us the wrong one.

621
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,693
On my children, 
I will work with you.

622
00:32:57,818 --> 00:32:59,934
I would never say that in the air.

623
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,546
I am with you.

624
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:03,991
100 %.

625
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:09,151
If someone has to say, "I swear 
on my children and my family"...

626
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:10,661
It's a bad sign.

627
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:13,069
If Domenick 
really votes for Angela,

628
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:17,138
so we decide who leaves, 
because the Naviti are only 3 left.

629
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,101
So we can choose, 
Wendell or Morgan.

630
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:23,171
We need Wendell. 
Morgan, then.

631
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:26,107
We vote... 
Because of the idol.

632
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,948
I was not very hot,

633
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:30,512
because I can trust Morgan.

634
00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:32,774
I'd rather not target her

635
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:35,556
and keep 
it as long as possible.

636
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:39,493
Domenick 
is a sort of Russell Hantz.

637
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:41,528
He could have a real idol,

638
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,151
showing us the wrong one 
to deceive us.

639
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:46,442
I doubt he has an idol.

640
00:33:46,846 --> 00:33:49,171
You doubt it, but if there is one...?

641
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:53,652
We will need Wendell and Morgan 
in the trials,

642
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:55,065
no Angela.

643
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,971
Whatever we decide,

644
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:59,660
we all four have to

645
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:01,728
have the same target, then...

646
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:04,331
We have to decide quickly 
before the council.

647
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,851
I don't want to eliminate Morgan.

648
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:10,145
It would be much simpler

649
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,893
to eliminate Angela unanimously.

650
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:15,815
The question is: 
do we bet on alliances

651
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,712
spent in the old Malolo,

652
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:20,734
or do we mix?

653
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:23,248
This decision is a turning point.

654
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:26,361
Every day the stakes 
get higher.

655
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,882
If that's your first tip, 
behind you: torches.

656
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,235
Take one 
and light it in the fire,

657
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,748
It is part 
of the council ritual,

658
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:11,343
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

659
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:13,153
If he disappears, so do you.

660
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,118
That's crazy.

661
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:17,257
Morgan. You return to the camp,

662
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:19,993
with Chris on Ghost Island, 
four four.

663
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:24,264
Basically, we split 
into two groups of four.

664
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:29,242
At this point, the two tribes 
remain firmly between them.

665
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,304
Wendell, is that really the case?

666
00:35:31,554 --> 00:35:33,773
Two groups of four?

667
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:35,775
Yes, we were on the bed,

668
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:39,246
them in the living room, 
strategizing.

669
00:35:39,496 --> 00:35:41,767
We can only hope 
that someone cracks,

670
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,488
maybe recruit someone.

671
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:46,319
What if they're 
in the living room and you're in the kitchen?

672
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:49,222
Good question.

673
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,526
You have to get out of the kitchen, 
approach someone.

674
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,975
Domenick. Are you surprised 
it was so separate,

675
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,108
since it's 
a million vote for someone tonight?

676
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,435
Yes, Jeff. 
If it turns to four four,

677
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:05,397
I don't want 
a stone to decide my fate.

678
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:08,062
So I came out 
of the kitchen a bit,

679
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:11,450
I explored the situation, 
to see if there were flaws,

680
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:13,160
what everyone thought.

681
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:15,895
Angela. And you? What did you see 
back at camp?

682
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:19,455
I also left the kitchen, 
I discussed.

683
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,652
And tonight, I'm torn.

684
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,823
I can make the popular decision

685
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,634
or the one that is good for me.

686
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,528
But I feel enormous pressure.

687
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:33,033
So there, I want 
it to be my decision, for me.

688
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:36,402
Your words amaze me. 
What pressure?

689
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,505
When mixing,

690
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,243
Chris started trying to get 
us Malolos.

691
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:46,546
And it was more pressure 
than expressing opinions.

692
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:49,482
But Chris is not there. 
He left.

693
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:52,285
Morgan. 
Do you think there is a chance

694
00:36:52,535 --> 00:36:53,753
that despite Chris,

695
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,089
this evening 
unites the Naviti more?

696
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,757
I think so.

697
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:01,226
We have good relations.

698
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:03,902
But there are 
four new people.

699
00:37:04,027 --> 00:37:07,959
We try to build relationships 
with them as well.

700
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:10,370
Domenick. Do you feel that too?

701
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,319
Different relationships?

702
00:37:12,444 --> 00:37:13,540
Absolutely.

703
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,173
I am very comfortable 
with this new quartet,

704
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:18,106
I sense new possibilities

705
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:20,780
and am always open 
to listening to others.

706
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,153
I want to hear what they have to say

707
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:26,676
and I will determine 
whether I want to follow or not.

708
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:30,457
Everyone paints this beautiful picture.

709
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,283
A group of four here, 
another there.

710
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:36,947
But the more questions I ask, the 
less accurate it seems.

711
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:39,762
Yes. In fact, I'm surprised.

712
00:37:39,887 --> 00:37:42,636
For me, 
there were four welded Navitis.

713
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,782
That may not be the case anymore, 
in fact.

714
00:37:45,907 --> 00:37:48,597
Or, Morgan, 
maybe it's part of a plan.

715
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:51,315
We are always in doubt, 
at the council.

716
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,532
Yes. We could all 
be lying

717
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,232
or all tell the truth.

718
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,777
Are we all good actors?

719
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,720
Or are we sincere?

720
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,555
Only time will tell.

721
00:38:02,732 --> 00:38:06,094
Libby. How to Determine 
When Lying is Appropriate

722
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:07,921
and when to be honest?

723
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:09,863
I love that you ask me that.

724
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:11,297
Why is that ?

725
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:15,035
'Cause you'd think 
the nice girl, sweet,

726
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:17,570
don't like to lie too much.

727
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,874
But you gotta make sure 
others believe you

728
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:22,748
to achieve something.

729
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:25,804
So you have to be ready 
to fabricate, sometimes.

730
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,429
But that's the game.

731
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:29,616
Morgan. When Libby said that,

732
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:33,195
her smile widened, 
her charm spread.

733
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,654
But look at her!

734
00:38:34,904 --> 00:38:37,157
We want to trust him!

735
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:40,254
She's beautiful, adorable, 
how could she lie?

736
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,275
But that's part of the game. 
Everyone lies.

737
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,580
Even Libby, I'm sure,

738
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:48,435
lie, or to lie, at one time.

739
00:38:49,796 --> 00:38:52,839
So Wendell. Sitting here, 
what do you think is going to happen?

740
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:54,674
On the main lines.

741
00:38:54,924 --> 00:38:57,377
I'd like to hope 
someone makes a hit,

742
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:01,053
that at the end of the evening, 
we are a stronger tribe,

743
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:04,494
who wants to collaborate 
and achieve victories.

744
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:09,124
Good. It's time to vote.

745
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:10,696
Laurel, over to you.

746
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:49,816
I will count the votes.

747
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:01,500
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

748
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,400
now is the time to do it.

749
00:40:07,462 --> 00:40:09,889
Good. Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

750
00:40:10,014 --> 00:40:12,611
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

751
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,277
I will read the votes.

752
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:25,890
Angela.

753
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:31,139
Angela. 
Three votes Angela,

754
00:40:31,424 --> 00:40:32,539
a Libby vote.

755
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:39,904
Morgan.

756
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:43,159
Three Angela votes, 
two Morgan votes, one Libby vote.

757
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:48,456
Morgan.

758
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:50,516
Equality. Three votes Angela,

759
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:53,574
three Morgan votes, one Libby vote. 
One vote remains.

760
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:56,796
Shit !

761
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,614
Third person eliminated 
from Survivor Ghost Island:

762
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,375
Morgan. 
Bring me your torch.

763
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:19,219
Morgan, the tribe has spoken.

764
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:23,223
It's time to go.

765
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:25,897
Do not trust 
the pretty blonde!

766
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,851
This advice was centered 
on one question.

767
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:41,797
Were things locked

768
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:43,733
or was someone 
going to make a move?

769
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:45,699
Apparently 
someone made a hit.

770
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:48,748
And that's how we play Survivor.

771
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:51,942
Take your torches, 
return to your camp. Good night.

772
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:09,439
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

773
00:42:12,722 --> 00:42:15,208
Next time in Survivor...

774
00:42:15,394 --> 00:42:16,830
When we are cornered...

775
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:18,768
We got everyone back together.

776
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:20,006
...and exhibited...

777
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:23,850
It's frustrating. 
I still have so much to give.

778
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:26,341
...we need protection... 
I have the idol.

779
00:42:26,466 --> 00:42:27,754
You can open the game.

780
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,044
... to survive. 
I have an idol.

781
00:42:30,206 --> 00:42:32,602
Lord ! 
Let's act!

782
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:36,124
I have the Heir Advantage, 
actually.

783
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,386
I thought he would help me.

784
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:40,647
It clearly didn't work.

785
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:44,183
So it may be a curse, 
but I bequeath

786
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:46,509
this advantage to Domenick.

787
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:49,281
He was always 
open and honest with me.

788
00:42:49,406 --> 00:42:52,512
I hope it's not cursed. 
If so, sorry!
