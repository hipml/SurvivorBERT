00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,370
THIS IS A GAME OF PATIENCE.

138
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,497
HOPEFULLY HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING

139
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:07,747
STUPID.

140
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,833

163
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,575
TO ONE OF OUR SIX.

164
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,827
ONCE HE DOES THAT, THAT'S OUR

165
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,452
SAFE WAY OUT.

166
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,746
I AM NOT ONLY LEADING THE HORSE

00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,332
PURPLE TEAM NOW HAS ALL 20 OF

375
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,083
THEIR BAGS.

376
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,251
WOO IS NOW BOUNCING.

377
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,628
EVERYBODY IS NOW BOUNCING

378
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,089
SANDBAGS OFF THE TRAMPOLINE.

379
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,799
AND TONY WITH THE FOURTH BAG.

380
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,968
>> ONE MORE, ONE MORE.

381
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:18,969
>> Jeff: TONY NEED ONE MORE

382
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,305
AND HE DISW IT.

383
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,974
TONY, JEREMIAH AND SPENCER WIN

384
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,685
REWARD, SPA DAY.

385
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,104
>> NICE JOB.

386
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:34,568
>> GOOD TRY.

387
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,111
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SPENCER

388
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,153
TONY,

389
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,947
JEREMIAH, NICE DAY IN FOR YOU.

390
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,824
FIRST YOU GET CLEAN WITH A NICE

391
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,074
SHOWER.

392
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,160
THEN A NICE MASSAGE, AND THEN A.

393
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,787
GRAB YOUR STUFF. OUT.

394
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,789
ENJOY THE AFTERNOON.

395
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,376
TRISH, JEFRA, L.J., KASS, WOO,

396
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,335
TASHA, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

397
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:51,961
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

398
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,463
CAMP.

399
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,798
>> WINNING A REWARD SOMETIMES

400
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,550
CAN BE VERY CRUCIAL TO THE GAME

401
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,676
I'M GOING TO TALK TO SPENCER AND

402
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,760
JEREMIAH BECAUSE I'M THINKING OF

403
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,095
BLINDED SIDING L.J.

404
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:01,846
YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL ME THE

405
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,138
OPPORTUNIST.

406
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,932
BECAUSE IF I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY

407
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,017
I'M GOING TO JUMP ON IT.

408
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,162
COMING BACK FROM THE

409
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:26,871
CHALLANGE, I'M JUST PICTURING

410
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:32,418
MYSELF GETTING MANI AND PEDI,

411
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:39,133
AND A NICE, COLD ONE

412
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,593
BOOM, I SNAPPED BACK INTO

413
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,177
REALITY, LIKE, OH, MAN, I'M

414
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,803
GOING TO BE PROBABLY SPEND HOURS

415
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,139
ON THE FIRE AND, YOU KNOW,

416
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,599
EATING A PLATE OF WHITE RICE

417
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:46,932
BUT, YOU KNOW.

418
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,642
ON A LIGHTER NOTE, IT'S KIND OF

419
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,603
NICE TO KNOW THAT MY BOY TONY

420
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,937
IS GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON

421
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,481
SPENCER AND JEREMIAH AND JUST

422
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,483
MAKE SURE THEY DON'T JEOPARDIZE

423
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:55,816
OUR GAME PLAN.

424
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,859
>> THEY EARNED IT.

425
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,736
THEY KICKED OUR BUTT.

426
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,112
>> THEY DID, THEY REALLY DID.

427
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:00,863
>> DON'T GET ME WRONG.

428
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,241
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE THIS

429
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:04,408
HIT.

430
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:04,950
I THINK WE ALL WOULD HAVE.

431
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:05,201
>> RIGHT.

432
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:05,868
>> AT THIS POINT, AT LEAST WE'RE

433
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,578
STILL HERE.

434
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,662
EVERYBODY IS DOWN BECAUSE WE

435
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,997
DIDN'T WIN THE REWARD BUT

436
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,665
PERSONALLY IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME

437
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,000
AS GREAT AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

438
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:13,876
I'M STILL HERE IN THE GAME AND I

439
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,919
DO BELIEVE IN OUR CORE SIX AND I

440
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,047
THINK WEUL KNOW IT'S BEST IF WE

441
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,592
STICK AROUND-- TOGETHER RIGHT

442
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,051
NOW.

443
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,136
>> TONY'S GOT MAJOR ANXIETY

444
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,929
RIGHT NOW.

445
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,514
HE'S LIKE WHAT, DO YOU THINK OF

446
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:26,972
THE IDOL?

447
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,015
I THINK WOOS THAT?

448
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,016
SHOULD WE GET RID OF WOO SOON?

449
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,477
SHOULD WE GET RID OF WOO NOW?

450
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,145
SOME I'M JUST TRYING TO CALM HIM

451
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:33,354
DOWN.

452
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:33,604
>> RIGHT.

453
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,523
>> WE HAVE PLENTY OF VOTES.

454
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,274
>> WHAT'S HE WORRIED ABOUT,

455
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:37,483
YEAH?

456
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,818
>> THE FACT THAT TONY GOT A LOT

457
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,362
OF VOTES AT TRIBAL COUNCIL MADE

458
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,113
HIM REALLY FEEL LIKE, "THEY WANT

459
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:43,948
TO GET RID OF ME.

460
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,534
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF ME."

461
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,035
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

462
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,079
I BUILT A STRONG BOND WITH TONY

463
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,456
BECAUSE MY LOYALTY IS THERE.

464
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,625
I PULLED THE IDOL OUT FOR HIM

465
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,044
AND I TRUST HE'LL DO THE RIGHT

466
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:57,586
THING.

467
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,713
THESE THREE PEOPLE HAVE TO GO

468
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,840
BEFORE ANYTHING-- TASH, SPENCER,

469
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,258
ASK JEREMIAH.

470
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,634
>> IF ANY OF THOSE THREE GO TO

471
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,718
THE END, THEY WIN.

472
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,010
>> ABSOLUTE.

473
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,637
>> IN THE BOTTOM LINE, WE NEED

474
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,137
TO PUT OUT TONY'S FIRE.

475
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,598
>> I'LL PUT OUT TONY'S FIRE.

476
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,350
>> OR ELSE WE'RE SCREWED.

477
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,061
>> TONY IS PANICKING BECAUSE HE

478
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,688
THINKS WOO MIGHT HAVE FOUND THE

479
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:15,896
IDOL.

480
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,231
I KNOW HOW TO GET TO TONY.

481
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,276
I CAN TELL TONY HE NEED TO

482
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:20,442
RELAX.

483
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,028
S DOWN WE HAVE TO STIX WITH SICK

484
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,446
WITH THE STIX.

485
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,657
>> I MADE A PLAN FOR FUTURE AND

486
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,076
IT RELIES ON PATIENCE AND SLONG

487
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,203
GO WITH THE PLAN WE COAL

488
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:31,495
EVERYTHING.

489
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,121
>> I THINK THE SIX OF US SHOULD

490
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,456
STAY STRONG BECAUSE THAT'S WANT

491
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,624
BEST SCENARIO FOR US THREE

492
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:40,963
SITTING HERE.

493
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:41,964
>> WELCOME.

494
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,301
>> JUST GRAB ONE?

495
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,802
>> VODKA AND RUM.

496
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,928
>> THANK YOU.

497
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,470
>> THANK YOU!

498
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,472
>> FOR ME, REWARD CHALLENGES ARE

499
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,473
A CHANCE TO BETTER MY POSITION

500
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,349
IN THE GAME.

501
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,602
RIGHT NOW, I DEFINITELY HAVE THE

502
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,269
ODDS STACKED AGAINST ME.

503
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,062
I'M NOT IN A POWERFUL POSITION.

504
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,606
AND I'M DOWN BUT I'M NOT OUT.

505
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,773
AND I'VE BEEN DOWN BEFORE.

506
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,734
AND I GOT BACK UP.

507
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,776
SO THERE'S NO REASON I CAN'T GET

508
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,739
IT BACK.

509
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,073
>> THIS IS QUITE AWESOME.

510
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,034
THIS IS WHAT WE GET.

511
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,619
I WAS HAPPY TO BE PAIRED UP WITH

512
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,787
JEREMIAH, WHO IS KIND OF LIKE MY

513
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,705
RIGHT-HAND MAN AT THIS POINT,

514
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,999
AND TONE, A GUY I WOULD LIKE TO

515
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,000
HEAR FROM AND SEE WHERE HIS HEAD

516
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,461
IS AT.

517
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:20,711
WHO KNOWS?

518
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,129
MAYBE IT WILL GIVE ME NEW LIFE

519
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:22,421
IN THE GAME.

520
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,130
>> OH, I FEEL GOOD.

521
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,050
>> WHAT'S UP, SPENCER.

522
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,593
DO YOU WANT TO TALK STRATEGY,

523
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,135
SEE WHERE YOUR HEAD IS AT?

524
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,845
>> YEAH.

525
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,055
>> YOU GUYS THINK YOU'RE GOING

526
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,056
TO GET PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE?

527
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:32,890
>> I DON'T KNOW.

528
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,892
>> IT'S NEVER THAT EASY, MAN.

529
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,185
>> IT DEPENDS WHERE YOUR HEAD IS

530
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:36,352
AT.

531
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,187
>> ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WHERE YOU

532
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,021
ARE RIGHT NOW?

533
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,523
>> NEVER COMFORTABLE, MY FRIEND.

534
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,108
SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

535
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,234
YOU GIENS IT.

536
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,152
HANG IN THERE UNTIL THE TIME

537
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,029
COMES, AND WHEN THE TIME COMES

538
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,529
I'LL APPROACH YOU GUYS.

539
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,822
YOU KNOW THAT.

540
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,366
>> THE QUESTION SWILL THAT TIME

541
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:50,824
COME WHEN WE'RE HERE?

542
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,202
>> I THINK SO, I THINK SO, MAN.

543
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,579
>> I THINK BASICALLY WE'RE PAWNS

544
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,205
ON THE BOARD BUT YOU CAN USE US

545
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,081
IF YOU WANT.

546
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,416
>> TALKING TO JEREMIAH AND

547
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,042
SPENCER IS ALLOWING ME TO HAVE

548
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,168
ANOTHER BIG MOVE THAT WILL GET

549
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,128
ME TO THE TOP.

550
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,046
I JUST NEED THE VOTE WHEN IT'S

551
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,882
TIME TO TAKE L.J. OUT, AND THEN

552
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,050
I'LL GO BACK TO MY ALLIANCE BUT

553
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,552
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE DESPERATE.

554
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,136
WHEN PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE, YOU

555
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,639
DO THE THINKING FOR THEM.

556
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,223
WHATEVER I TELL THEM, THEY GO

557
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,974
WITH ME.

558
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,435
IF THEY GO AGAINST ME, THEY'RE

559
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,395
SEALING THEIR OWN FATE.

560
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,729
>> THAT FEELS GOOD RIGHT THERE.

561
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,105
>> OH, MY GOSH.

562
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,190
>> THIS IS NICE, MAN.

563
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,024
>> OH, MY GOSH.

564
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,484
>> I NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE

565
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:25,984
THIS BEFORE.

566
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:26,985
>> ARE YOU NOW, BUDDY.

567
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,278
>> YEAH, I'M IN IT.

568
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,071
>> WE COULD WORK SOMETHING OUT,

569
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,699
MAN, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

570
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,325
I NEED TO KEEP YOU GUYS WHEN I'M

571
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,452
READY TO MAKE A BIG MOVE ON MY

572
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:35,661
TEAM.

573
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,286
I'M SURE SOMEBODY IS THINKING WE

574
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,622
HAVE TO GET RID OF TONY SOONER

575
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,124
OR LATER.

576
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,667
TONE'S' THREAT.

577
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,835
THEY'RE LOOK AT ME THAT WAY.

578
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:47,464
I NEED YOU GUYS TO HELP ME

579
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:47,715
ADVANCE.

580
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,924
THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL I CAN'T

581
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:52,010
GET RID OF TWO TWO.

582
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,220
I LIKE BIG MOVE.

583
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,806
>> TONY IS SAYING HE'S

584
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,808
GUARANTEEING HE HAS MY BACK.

585
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,434
HIS WHEELS ARE TURNING AND HE'S

586
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,059
PLAYING THE GAME.

587
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,603
RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO BELIEVE HIM

588
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,312
A LITTLE BIT.

589
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,063
STILL I HAVE MY DOUBTS.

590
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:07,234
HE MIGHT BE PLAYING US.

591
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,195
H>> IT JUST HAPPENED WE GOT HERE

592
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:10,446
BY CHANCE.

593
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,322
WE PICKED ROCKS PURPOSE WE WERE

594
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,991
ON THE SAME TEAM AND THAT'S HOW

595
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,784
THE GAME CHANGED.

596
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,077
THAT'S HOW THE GAME CHANGES ALL

597
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:17,828
THE TIME.

598
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,788
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS ALL THAT.

599
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,457
>> RIGHT NOW I'LL BE HONEST.

600
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,500
I DON'T TRUST TONY THAT MUCH.

601
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,793
TONE SEPLAYING A LOT OF PEOPLE

602
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,127
RIGHT NOW.

603
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,754
HE'S JUGGLING A LOT OF BECAUSE,

604
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,922
AND I'M JUST ONE OF THEM.

605
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,591
HE DOESN'T THIS, BUT I HAVE AN

606
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:30,799
IDOL.

607
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,093
IF I FEEL UNEASY, I WON'T

608
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,386
HESITATE TO USE IT.

609
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,722
I'LL TELL TONY I TRUST HIM 100%

610
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,974
BECAUSE IF HE CAN TAKE ME A

611
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:39,600
LITTLE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD, I

612
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,518
MIGHT FIND THE DETOUR THAT COULD

613
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,186
TAKE ME ALL THE WAY.

614
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,826
>> I ATE A LOT, BRO.

615
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,578
>> IT WAS LIKE A PICNIC.

616
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,705
JUST STARTED PIGGING OUT.

617
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,122
NO, IT WAS NICE.

618
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,584
>> IT'S DAY 25, AND I'M IN A

619
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,251
THREE-PERSON ALLIANCE UP AGAINST

620
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,670
A SIX-PERSON ALLIANCE.

621
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,923
IT DOESN'T TAKE A C.P.A., LIKE

622
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,423
MYSELF, TO DO THAT MATH.

623
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,009
SO I NEED TO CONVINCE SOMEONE TO

624
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,638
FLIP OR MAKE A BIG MOVE.

625
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,431
AND I THINK L.J. IS SMART ENOUGH

626
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,350
TO REALIZE THAT TONY IS NOT

627
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,560
GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER STRONG GUY

628
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,522
TO THE END.

629
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,524
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TALK?

630
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,569
>> I MEAN, I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO

631
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:32,820
LISTEN.

632
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,949
>> I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

633
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,619
IT'S REALLY GOOD, TOO.

634
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,125
>> TASHA WANTS TO TAKE ME ASIDE

635
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,293
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION.

636
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,003
I TOLD HER I WAS WILLING TO

637
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,380
LISTEN, BUT TONY IS A FLAMING

638
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,965
BALL OF ANXIETY RIGHT NOW, AND

639
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,550
IF I GO TAKE A WALK SOMEWHERE

640
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,218
WITH TASHA, THAT IS JUST MORE

641
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,511
FUEL TO THE FIRE.

642
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,303
EITHER WAY, THERE'S NO SITUATION

643
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,597
WHERE I FEEL LIKE SHE CAN

644
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,225
BENEFIT ME IN MY FUTURE GAME

645
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:03,392
PLAY.

646
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,768
BECAUSE I TRUST TONE PEP HE'S

647
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,271
THE REASON I'M STILL OUT HERE.

648
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,022
SO AS LONG AS WE STICK TO THE

649
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,732
PLAN WE HAVE INTACT, WE'LL BE

650
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,194
GOOD.

651
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:19,241
>> I INVITED L.J. TO RENDEZVOUS

652
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,034
WITH ME TO DISCUSS SOME

653
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,786
STRATEGY, AND HE STOOD ME UP.

654
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,204
IF L.J. WAS MAN ENOUGH TO MAKE A

655
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,374
BIG MOVE, HE CAN TAKE JEFF RARKS

656
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,168
SPENCER, JEREMIAH, AND I, AND

657
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,128
BLINDEDIDE TONY.

658
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,923
BUT IT'S CLEAR TONE SERUN THE

659
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,300
SHOW AROUND HERE AND EVERYONE IS

660
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,843
UNDER TONY'S THUMB.

661
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,221
SO UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES, I'M

662
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,057
SCREWED.

663
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:44,892
>> TREE MAIL!

664
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,893
>> YES, ALL RIGHT.

665
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,436
>> FEELING GOOD AL ALREADY!

666
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,439
>> LET'S SEE HERE.

667
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,317
"PURPLE, BLURK YELLOW, AND RED.

668
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,944
LIKE SUNSETS, THE COLORS ARE

669
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,111
VIVID.

670
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,947
BLACK AND BLUES COULD BRUISE

671
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,491
YOUR EGO AND BEING VOTED OUT

672
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,327
COULD MAKE YOU LIVID."

673
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,038
>> OKAY...

674
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,165
>> THIS CHALLENGE TODAY IS HUGE.

675
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,416
I'M THINKING IN MY HEAD, L.J.'S

676
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,168
A CLEVER GUY.

677
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,586
IT'S GOING TO BE A MATTER OF WHO

678
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,629
THROWS THE FIRST PUNCH BETWEEN

679
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,296
THE BOTH OF US.

680
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,715
TIMING IS EVERYTHING, AND THIS

681
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,009
COULD BE MY TIME TO STRIKE.

682
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,344
IF L.J. DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY, HE

683
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,970
MIGHT BE THE NEXT ONE GOING

684
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,057
HOME.

685
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,689
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

686
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,868
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

687
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,327
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

688
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,161
>> YES.

689
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:49,247
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST--

690
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,082
SPENCEY, TAKE IT BACK.

691
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,960
>> I'M LET YOU HOLD ON TO IT FOR

692
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:53,210
ME, JEFF.

693
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,504
>> Jeff: OKAY.

694
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,048
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

695
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:58,715

HAVE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

745
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,527
NEXT COLOR, AND DROP IT.

746
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,489
EVERYBODY SAYS RED EXCEPT WOO.

747
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,866
GREEN IS NOT RIGHT.

748
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,576
THE CORRECT COLOR WAS RED.

749
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,952
WOO IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

750
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,870
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

751
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,622
>> IT'S HARD TONG, MAN.

752
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,332
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LAST

753
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:55,540
COLOR.

754
00:22:55,624 --> 00:23:00,253
EVERYBODY DROP.

755
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,880
EVERYBODY SAYS GREEN.

756
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,298
EVERYBODY'S RIGHT.

757
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,382
EVERYBODY STAYS ALIVE.

758
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,884
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.

759
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,928
RELEASE ALL YOUR COLORS, WE'LL

760
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,555
GO AGAIN.

761
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,767
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO, NEXT

762
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,852
ROUND.

763
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,313
RED.

764
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,690
GREEN.

765
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,736
PURPLE.

766
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,655
BLACK.

767
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,200
BLUE.

768
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,035
GREEN.

769
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,745
BLUE.

770
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:33,995
ALL RIGHT.

771
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,793
LET'S DO IT.

772
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:44,381
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR FIRST COLOR.

773
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,340
EVERYBODY SAYS RED.

774
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,466
WE ARE OFF TO A GOOD START.

775
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:53,056
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR NEXT COLOR.

776
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,765
EVERYBODY SAYS GREEN.

777
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,685
ONCE AGAIN, EVERYBODY RIGHT.

778
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,688
NEXT COLOR.

779
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,315
EVERYBODY SAYS PURPLE.

780
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,527
EVERYBODY RIGHT AGAIN.

781
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:13,243
NEXT COLOR.

782
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,452
EVERYBODY SAYS BLACK.

783
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,537
EVERYONE IS RIGHT.

784
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,541
NEXT COLOR.

785
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,459
BLUE IS RIGHT.

786
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,627
EVERYBODY GOT IT RIGHT.

787
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:31,469
NEXT COLOR.

788
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,305
SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO IN GRADE

789
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,222
SCHOOL CAN BE SO DIFFICULT AFTER

790
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,810
25 DAYS OF DEPRIVATION.

791
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:48,737
EVERYBODY DROP.

792
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,780
L.J., TASHA, AND TONY SAID

793
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:51,740
GREEN.

794
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,743
JEFRA, CAS, AND SPENCER SAID

795
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:54,951
YELLOW.

796
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,620
JEREMIAH SAID RED.

797
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:06,463
CORRECT ANSWER-- GREEN.

798
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,299
JEFRA'S WRONG, KASS GOT IT

799
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:09,507
WRONG.

800
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,802
SPENCER GOT IT WRONG, JEREMIAH'S

801
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:13,011
WRONG.

802
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,887
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

803
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,556
WE ARE DOWN TO THREE-- L.J.,

804
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,558
TASHA, AND TONY.

805
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,601
BIG IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.

806
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:32,697
LAST COLOR.

807
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:37,869
EVERYBODY DROP.

808
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,121
WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT RECALL

809
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:40,372
COLORS.

810
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:44,918
LK HAS RED.

811
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,671
TASHA HAS BLUE, TONY HAS YELLOW.

812
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,714
TONY, YOU'RE SHAKE YOUR HEAD.

813
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,425
>> Jeff: I THINK IT WAS WRONG.

814
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,969
IT WAS NOT YELLOW.

815
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,221
IT'S NOT YOURS.

816
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,597
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

817
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,725
THAT LEAVES US WITH TWO.

818
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,019
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU L.J.?

819
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:03,645
>> PRETTY CONFIDENT.

820
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,438
>> Jeff: HOW ABOUT YOU TASHA?

821
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,439
>> SAME FOR ME.

822
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,023
>> Jeff: ONE OF YOU IS RIGHT.

823
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,858
ONE OF YOU IS WRONG.

824
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:16,741
CORRECT ANSWER IS... BLUE.

825
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,534
L.J.'S WRONG.

826
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,743
TASHA WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

827
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,119
CONGRATULATIONS.

828
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,705
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

829
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,374
TASHA, COME ON OVER.

830
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,543
>> WAY TO GO, TASHA.

831
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,627
>> Jeff: NO BETTER TIME THAN

832
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,421
RIGHT NOW TO HAVE IMMUNITY FOR

833
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:29,587
YOU.

834
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:29,921
>> I NEED IT.

835
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,759
>> Jeff: TASHA SAFE AT THE

836
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,093
VOTE TONIGHT.

837
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,470
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY

838
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,805
GOING HOME TONIGHT.

839
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,640
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

840
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,016
CAMP.

841
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,391
CONGRATS.

842
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,183
>> WHEN TASHA WON THE

843
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,978
IMMUNITY, IMMEDIATELY MY MIND

844
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,062
STARTED CRANKING.

845
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,648
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS SPLIT THE

846
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,610
VOTE 3-3, SO IF EVERYONE STICKS

847
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,737
TO THE PLAN ONE OF THEM IS GOING

848
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,822
HOME.

849
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,505
>> THANK YOU, GUYS.

850
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,256
>> CONGRATS.

851
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,051
>> GOOD JOB.

852
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:16,968
>> THAT WAS TOUGH, MAN.

853
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,763
I MISSED THE BLUE, MAN.

854
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,972
BY ONE I MISSED IT.

855
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,307
>> I'M SO EXCITED.

856
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,225
THIS WAS A DO-OR-DIE CHALLENGE

857
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,268
FOR ME TODAY.

858
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,936
I KNEW I HAD A ONE-THIRD CHANCE

859
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,980
OF BEING VOTED OUT TONIGHT, SO

860
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,815
THIS PRETTY LITTLE THING AROUND

861
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,360
MY NECK SECURES THREE MORE DAYS

862
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,528
IN THIS GAME FOR ME.

863
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,614
SO, IN YOUR FACE, L.J.

864
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,996
>> HERE'S MY DEAL-- I THINK WE

865
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,372
SPLIT THE VOTE.

866
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:50,126
>> WHY-- WHY SPLIT?

867
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,503
BECAUSE OF THE IDOL?

868
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,921
>> YES, IF SOMEBODY FLIPS--

869
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,422
>> NOBODY IS GOING TO FLIP AT

870
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,715
THIS SAME OF THE GAME.

871
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,384
>> ALL RIGHT.

872
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,635
>> I MEAN I HOPE NOT.

873
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,677
>> THAT'S THE BEST PLAY.

874
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,261
>> I ACTUALLY, FOR THE FIRST

875
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,763
TIME IN THIS GAME FEEL

876
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,055
COMFORTABLE.

877
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,391
WE HAVE A MAJORITY OF SIX.

878
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,560
SO SPENCER AND JEREMIAH ARE EASY

879
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:07,811
PICKINGS.

880
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,770
BUT TONY'S CONCERNED THAT WOO

881
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,106
MIGHT HAVE AN IDOL, AND MAYBE WE

882
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,690
SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

883
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,566
WHICH IS SO STUPID.

884
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,818
I MEAN, WE MADE A PLAN THAT WE

885
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,902
ALL AGREED TO.

886
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,905
WE ALL DID OUR PINKY SWEAR, SO

887
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,783
WE JUST NEED TO STICK TO THE

888
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:21,991
PLAN.

889
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,952
>> WHO IS VOTING FOR WHO?

890
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,871
>> BOYS VOTE FOR JEREMIAH.

891
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,790
>> WE VOTE FOR SPENCER.

892
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,500
>> ALL RIGHT.

893
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,668
>> HERE'S THE DEAL-- I'M NOT

894
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,627
GOING TO WAIT TO GET A PUNCH

895
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,878
THROWN AT ME BY L.J.

896
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,796
HE SAID HE WAS WILLING TO

897
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,131
BLINDSIDE WOO.

898
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,842
IT'S TRUE I SET HIM UP BUT I'M

899
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,468
GOING TO TRY TO PIN ALL THE

900
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,138
TROUBLE AT CAMP ON L.J., I HAVE

901
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,597
TO STRIKE NOW BEFORE HE GETS THE

902
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,098
IDEA OF DOING IT TO ME.

903
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,559
BUT FIRST I HAVE A LOT OF WORK

904
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:54,399
TO DO.

905
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,033
>> HE-- HE MIGHT BLINDSIDE

906
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,618
YOU, AND I DONT LIKE THAT.

907
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,036
IF HE'S WILLING TO BREAK HIS

908
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,663
PROMISE FOR YOU, HE'LL BE

909
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,039
WILLING TO BREAK HIS PROMISE FOR

910
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:10,206
ME.

911
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,749
>> THAT IS RIDICULOUS, THOUGH,

912
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:11,916
MAN.

913
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,127
I WAS 100% DOWN WITH THE SIX.

914
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:20,383
BUT, APPARENTLY, L.J., MR. CON

915
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,968
MAN, FOR SOME REASON WANTS TO

916
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,719
BLINDSIDE ME.

917
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,512
IF HE'S COMING TO TONY, MY

918
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,181
CLOSEST ALLY, AND SAYING WOO IS

919
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,348
GOING TO GO, WE MIGHT HAVE TO

920
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,477
MAKE A BIG MOVE BEFORE HE DOES.

921
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,187
>> HE'S WILLING TO BURN YOU.

922
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,605
SO IF YOU WANT TO-- YOU WANT TO

923
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,149
HAVE ANOTHER SHOCK FACE?

924
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,151
YEAH, I MEAN, I'M DOWN WITH

925
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:38,359
THAT.

926
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,196
I TRUST TONY THAT HE'S GOT MY

927
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:41,488
BACK.

928
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,531
SO IT'S GREAT TO HAVE HIM ON MY

929
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:43,823
SIDE.

930
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,367
AND IF ALL GOES WELL, MAN, IT'S

931
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,369
GOING TO BE ANOTHER HUGE NIGHT

932
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:56,586
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

933
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,672
>> HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO

934
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,131
HAPPEN.

935
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:12,227
TRUST ME, PLEASE, SPENCER.

936
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,938
>> TONY INITIALLY WANTED TO SAVE

937
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,940
ME AND JEREMIAH FOR A LATER

938
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,982
MOVE.

939
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,526
BUT, APPARENTLY, L.J. IS

940
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,444
PLOTTING TO GET OUT WOO.

941
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,154
SO TONY'S READY TO MAKE A BIG

942
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:27,617
MOVE NOW.

943
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,667
>> I'M DEFINITELY STOKED.

944
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,336
IT'S KIND OF LIKE CHRISTMAS

945
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,754
MORNING EYE WOKE UP EXPECTING TO

946
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,548
SEE NOTHING BUT ASHES AND COAL

947
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,091
UNDER THE TREE, AND THERE'S THIS

948
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,344
PRESENT OF "LET'S VOTE OUT L.J."

949
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,887
IT'S KIND OF TOO GOOD TO BE

950
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,096
TRUE.

951
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,764
THIS COULD BE A BIG LIE SO THAT

952
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,891
I DON'T PLAY MY IMMUNITY IDOL

953
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:52,433
TONIGHT.

954
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,476
STILL, I'M GOING TO TAKE

955
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,435
ANYTHING I CAN GET RIGHT NOW

956
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,979
BECAUSE IF I CAN JUST GET A

957
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,146
LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE

958
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,065
ROAD, HAVE A FEW VOTES GO MY

959
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:03,528
WAY, IT'S A WHOLE NEW GAME FOR

960
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:03,695
ME.

961
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,946
SO THINGS ARE HAPPENING RIGHT

962
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,822
NOW.

963
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,782
TONY'S PROBABLY TARGETING L.J.

964
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,158
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE SOLID--

965
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:09,993
>> I'M SOLID WITH YOU.

966
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,913
AND WE'LL BE SOLWID THEM.

967
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,915
I CAME INTO THIS TRIBE WITH

968
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:16,374
NOTHING.

969
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,418
>> SO WE JUST GOTTA BE CAREFUL

970
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,460
BECAUSE HE'S A SMART GUY.

971
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,336
>> HE'S VERY DANGEROUS.

972
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,462
YOU KNOW THAT.

973
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,672
HE'S VERY DANGEROUS.

974
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,257
>> RIGHT NOW WE CAN JUST LET

975
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,925
THEM KILL EACH OTHER AND WE'RE

976
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:26,134
GOOD.

977
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:30,722
>> LET'S DO IT.

978
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,684
>> L.J. WAS CONCERNED THAT YOU

979
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,437
WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WOO.

980
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,688
>> I WASN'T CONCERNED.

981
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,314
HE WAS CONCERNED.

982
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,274
HE WANTED TO VOTE HIM OUT, AND

983
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,025
MY FACE TURNED COLORS BECAUSE IT

984
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,527
WAS LIKE WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

985
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,153
>> HE TOLD ME YOU WANTED TO VOTE

986
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,487
HIM OUT.

987
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,615
>> I KNOW YOU LIKE L.J., BUT I

988
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,325
THINK HE'S SNEAKY, TRISH, MAN.

989
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,909
>> HE TOLD ME THAT YOU THOUGHT

990
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,244
WOO WAS A THREAT AND THAT YOU

991
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,912
WERE PANICKING AND THAT YOU

992
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,914
WANTED TO THROW WOO OUT BUT THAT

993
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,540
HE DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS A GOOD

994
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:57,749
IDEA.

995
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,834
>> MOARKS MAN, HE'S LYING TO

996
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,001
YOU.

997
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,211
WHAT DO YOU THINK L.J. WANTS, TO

998
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,338
COME IN FOURTH PLACE?

999
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,798
IT'S ME, IT'S YOU AND IT'S WOO.

1000
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,133
IT'S US THREE AGAINST JEFRA AND

1001
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:07,300
L.J.

1002
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,468
YOU DON'T THINK HE'S THINKING

1003
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,594
ABOUT THAT?

1004
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,304
HE'S ALREADY PLANNING AHEAD,

1005
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:11,512
TRISH.

1006
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,389
>> WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

1007
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,141
>> I'M NOT PROPOSING ANYTHING

1008
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:15,600
RIGHT NOW.

1009
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,685
>> TONY IS GET REALLY, REALLY

1010
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:17,977
PARANOID.

1011
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,519
HE TOLD ME TODAY AT THE WELL

1012
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,396
THAT L.J. IS TRYING TO BREAK THE

1013
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,065
SIX BUT L.J. TOLD ME A TOTALLY

1014
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:22,649
DIFFERENT STORY.

1015
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,943
HE SAID, "OH, MY GOD, TONY IS

1016
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:26,361
TOTALLY FREAK OUT.

1017
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,195
HE WANTS WOO GONE."

1018
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,530
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE

1019
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:29,697
NOW.

1020
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,368
>> SAY ME, YOU, WOO, THROW

1021
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:33,993
L.J.'S NAME DOWN, RIGHT, AND

1022
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,205
THEN WE TELL TASH, SPENCER, AND

1023
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,290
JEREMIAH TO THROW L.J.'S NAME

1024
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:39,499
DOWN--

1025
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,751
>> I'M STILL THINKING WE SHOULD

1026
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,335
ALL KEEP OUR PROMISE TO THE

1027
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,711
FINAL SIX.

1028
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,170
DON'T YOU THINK THAT?

1029
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,297
>> I WOULD THINK SO, BUT NOW I

1030
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:46,839
DON'T TRUST L.J.

1031
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,633
>> I JUST-- WHY DO YOU THINK HE

1032
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,009
TOLD ME YESTERDAY THAT YOU

1033
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,428
WANTED WOO OFF, AND IT WAS HIM

1034
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,264
THAT--

1035
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,224
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1036
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,809
HE'S GOING TO TRY SOMETHING

1037
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,184
SNEAKY, MAN.

1038
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,227
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

1039
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,144
>> OH, MAN, TRISH, YOU DON'T SEE

1040
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,854
IT, MAN.

1041
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,440
>> IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE L.J.

1042
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,400
IS UP TO SOMETHING.

1043
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,109
I THINK L.J. IS UP TO A LOT

1044
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,570
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO WIN BUT TONY

1045
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,072
HAS ALSO PLAYED ME AND I AM

1046
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,199
GULLIBLE BUT I'M NOT STUPID SO

1047
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,659
THERE'S NO WAY I'M BREAKING UP

1048
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:14,909
THE SIX.

1049
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:17,120
>> EVERYONE'S GOOD, RIGHT?

1050
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:17,620
YOU'RE SURE?

1051
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,706
>> I THINK SO WHEN TONY HAD HIS

1052
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,748
NAME WRITTEN DOWN FOUR TIMES--

1053
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,999
>> HE WAS PISSED.

1054
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,042
>> HE WAS PISSED.

1055
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,628
AND I SAID, "JUST TAKE A CHILL

1056
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:25,962
PILL.

1057
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:26,129
OF.

1058
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,255
>> NOBODY NEEDS TO MEAS THIS UP

1059
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:27,755
RIGHT NOW.

1060
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,215
I LOVE A GOOD BLINDSIDE, BUT

1061
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,883
IT'S TOO SOON.

1062
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,427
NO ONE WANTS TO MAKE A BIG MOVE

1063
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,052
RIGHT NOW.

1064
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,053
YOU'D BE STUPID, AND I THINK

1065
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,179
TONY KNOWS THAT.

1066
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,514
ALL SIX OF US ARE IN A GREAT

1067
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,181
POSITION AS LONG AS WE STICK

1068
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,057
WITH OUR ALLIANCE.

1069
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,183
>> DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO GO

1070
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,476
THROUGH WITH IT?

1071
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,103
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1072
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,813
I'M 50-50 ON HIM.

1073
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,524
>> RIGHT NOW, I HAVE A HUGE PLAN

1074
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,568
IN PLAY BUT TRISH IS TELLING ME

1075
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,111
LET'S KEEP THE SIX STRONG SO IF

1076
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,446
I GET RID OF L.J. THERE ARE

1077
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,823
GOING TO BE A LOT OF HARD

1078
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,115
FEELINGS.

1079
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,950
TRISH HAS BEEN WITH ME SINCE DAY

1080
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:56,117
ONE.

1081
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,618
SHE IS MY CLOSEST ALLY BUT IF I

1082
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,244
DO THIS SHE COULD TURN HER BACK

1083
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,913
ON ME AND THAT THE WHOLE THING

1084
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,874
WOULD BLOW UP IN MY FACE.

1085
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,125
IF THAT'S THE CASE, I HAVE TO

1086
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,960
STICK WITH MY ALLIANCE.

1087
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:06,586
IN LIFE, AS IN "SURVIVOR" YOU

1088
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,963
NEED TO KNOW WHEN TO KISS ASS OR

1089
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,256
KISS ASS, AND RIGHT NOW I MIGHT

1090
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,342
HAVE TO KISS ASS, AND GET RID OF

1091
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,679
SPENCER OR JEREMIAH.

1092
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:30,526
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1093
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:36,240
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1094
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,117
SARAH, AND MORGAN, VOTED OUT AT

1095
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:46,334
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1096
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,169
SO, JEREMIAH, UNLESS SOMETHING

1097
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,212
DRASTIC HAS CHANGED, IT WOULD

1098
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,590
SEEM THAT YOU, TASHA, AND SPERNS

1099
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,174
WOULD ALL STILL BE IN TROUBLE

1100
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,300
WITH THE OTHER SIX STILL TIGHT.

1101
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,552
>> YEAH, THAT'S A STRONGS SIX

1102
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,011
RIGHT THERE.

1103
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:59,680
YOU KNOW, ME AND SPENCER IS KIND

1104
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,015
OF LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE,

1105
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,141
OH, MAN, THIS AIN'T GOOD.

1106
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,310
>> Jeff: KASS, YOU'RE A BIG

1107
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,646
REASON WE NOW HAVE THIS

1108
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:06,896
DIVISION.

1109
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,315
IS THERE ANY EMPATHY FROM YOU

1110
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,274
TOWARDS THESE THREE THAT YOU

1111
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:10,983
USED TO BE A PART OF?

1112
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,318
>> I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE GAME,

1113
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,071
JEFF, AND FROM HEREON OUT PEOPLE

1114
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,531
MIGHT START MAKING MOVES LIKE

1115
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,281
WHAT I MADE.

1116
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,825
YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME AND NOT

1117
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,867
GET A LITTLE DIRT. TONY, KASS

1118
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,451
SAYS YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME

1119
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,369
WITHOUT GETTING A LITTLE DIRTY.

1120
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:21,911
>> YEAH, THAT'S TRUE, JEFF.

1121
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,455
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF CONFUSION

1122
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,873
OUT HERE BUT DON'T KNOW WHO IS

1123
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,667
SAYING WHAT, WHO IS TELLING THE

1124
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:27,875
TRUTH.

1125
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,168
WHEN WE COME TO THIS GAME WE'RE

1126
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,628
ACCEPTING FACT THAT WE'RE GOING

1127
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,922
TO BE DECEIVED, THAT WE'RE GOING

1128
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,048
TO GET STABBED IN THE BACK, AND

1129
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:34,674
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT MY BAG OF

1130
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,135
TRICKS WITH ME TODAY.

1131
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,011
>> Jeff: WHAT'S IN THE BAG OF

1132
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:39,220
TRICKS.

1133
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,263
>> WE'LL PROBABLY FIND OUT

1134
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,390
TONIGHT BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO

1135
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,059
MAKE ME FEEL MORE COMFORT HERE

1136
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:45,268
TONIGHT.

1137
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:45,893
>> Jeff: TASHA, THAT'S WHAT

1138
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,894
YOU WANT TO HEAR.

1139
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,355
IF THERE'S A TIGHT SIX, WHY

1140
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,898
WOULD TONY SAY I BROUGHT MY BAG

1141
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,900
OF TRICKS AND WE'LL PROBABLY

1142
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,276
FIND OUT TONIGHT?

1143
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,235
>> THAT'S WHY I'M GLADE HAVE

1144
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,320
THIS LOVELY NECKLACE AROUND MY

1145
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,905
NECK.

1146
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,698
ALLIANCES APPEAR REALLY TIGHT,

1147
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,033
BUT THE LONGER YOU CAN STAY IN

1148
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,743
IT, THE MORE YOU MIGHT SEE

1149
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:07,915
FRACTURES IN TIGHT ALLIANCES.

1150
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,667
>> Jeff: L.J., TASHA JUST USED

1151
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,086
AIR QUOTES TO DESCRIBE YOUR

1152
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,336
ALLIANCE.

1153
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,922
>> I THINK THAT SHE'S JUST

1154
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,716
GETTING A REALITY CHECK AND IS

1155
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,761
HOPEFUL THAT THERE IS SOME

1156
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,263
SORT OF CRACK IN OUR ALLIANCE.

1157
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,390
>> Jeff: WERE YOU APPROACHED

1158
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,268
TODAY BY SPENCER OR TAWSH OR

1159
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,103
JEREMIAH TO LOOK FOR THAT CRACK

1160
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,313
JIEFS VAGUELY APPROACHED.

1161
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,106
BUT I TOOK A STEP BACK AND

1162
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,274
REALIZED THERE'S NO TREEN CAUSE

1163
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,901
ANXIETY MOONGZ THE GROUP.

1164
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,445
I MEAN, WE'RE PRETTY WATER

1165
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:37,612
TIGHT.

1166
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,863
>> Jeff: IN YOUR LINE OF WORK,

1167
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:39,906
L.J., HOW BIG IS LOYALTY?

1168
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,448
>> IT'S HUGE.

1169
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,491
PUT IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING

1170
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,285
TO FIND.

1171
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:44,452
...

1172
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:44,994
>> Jeff: SO DO YOU FEEL LIKE

1173
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,579
YOU'RE A GOOD GAUGE OF IT?

1174
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,581
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I THINK I HAVE

1175
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,707
A VERY SHARP EYE.

1176
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,542
I'M VERY HONED IN TO THINGS THAT

1177
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,419
CAN BE DISLOYAL AND SO I THINK I

1178
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,588
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD GAUGE.

1179
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,089
>> Jeff: TONY, LINE OF WORK,

1180
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:57,506
WHAT DO YOU DO?

1181
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,799
>> CONSTRUCTION.

1182
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,800
>> Jeff: LOYALTY PLAY A PART

1183
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,885
IN THE CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS?

1184
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,887
>> YES, YOU'LL SEE IT OVER AND

1185
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,304
OVER, JEFF.

1186
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,972
YOU TURN YOUR EYE, ONE OF YOUR

1187
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,057
TOOLS IS MISSING.

1188
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,684
TRUST IS A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT

1189
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,353
THING, JEFF, ESPECIALLY IN

1190
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:10,645
"SURVIVOR."

1191
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,730
>> Jeff: KASS, LOYALTY, COME

1192
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,439
INTO PLAY FOR YOU?

1193
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,024
>> AT HOME, YES.

1194
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,359
BUT I TRIED TO CHECK MY LIFE AT

1195
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,152
THE DOOR WHEN I CAME ON HERE.

1196
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,196
YOU HAVE TO BE 100% SELFISH IF

1197
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,156
YOU'RE GOING TO GET FIRE IN THIS

1198
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,365
GAME.

1199
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,866
IT'S "SURVIVOR, NOT LIFE BUT

1200
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,368
IT'S HARD TO RECONCILE THAT.

1201
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,744
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THE GAME,

1202
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,829
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY FIGHTING WITH

1203
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,789
WHETHER YOU'RE A PLAYER OR

1204
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,417
PERSON AND CAN YOU BE BOTH OF

1205
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:33,626
THESE?

1206
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,502
>> Jeff: WOO, IF LOYALTY IS

1207
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,837
VERY IMPORTANT, WHEN DO YOU GET

1208
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,798
TO THE POINT WHERE YOU SAY I

1209
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,883
HAVE SOME THREAT TO MY AEXPLIENS

1210
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,259
I I NEED TO GET RID OF THEM?

1211
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,886
>> AT THIS POINT, JEFF, EVERYONE

1212
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,680
IS GOING TO BE PRONE AND

1213
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,389
SUSCEPTIBLE, A LITTLE PARANOIA.

1214
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,225
OUR SIX IS STILL STRONG SO MIGHT

1215
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,643
AS WELL GO WITH THE FLOW, START

1216
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,103
TAKING OUT THE BOTTOM THREE, BUT

1217
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,063
WE'RE GOING TO COME TO THAT TIME

1218
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,731
WHERE WE'RE GOG HAVE TO NAIK

1219
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:55,940
MOVES.

1220
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,191
>> Jeff: SPENCER, DO YOU LOOK

1221
00:37:57,274 --> 00:38:03,030
THAT SIX AND THINK I

1222
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:03,614
I KNOW WHO IS ON THE BOTTOM? I

1223
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,366
DON'T KNOW WHO IS ON THE BOTTOM.

1224
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:05,992
I DON'T.

1225
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,868
BUT I DO KNOW ONE IS ON THE

1226
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,246
BOTTOM BUT IF YOU'RE ONE BEING

1227
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,998
TOLD WE'RE A TIGHT SIX, THERE

1228
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,666
ARE NO DIVISIONS IN THE SIX,

1229
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,208
MAYBE YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM.

1230
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,543
AND IT IS TIME PEOPLE START

1231
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,378
THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN I PUT

1232
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,463
MYSELF IN A POSITION TO WIN?

1233
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,798
>> Jeff: TRISH, IS THERE ANY

1234
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,300
PART OF YOU THINKING, SOME

1235
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,051
SOMEBODY'S ON THE BOTTOM, THIS

1236
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,928
IS THE TIME TO MAKE A MOVE?

1237
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,848
>> WELL THINK OF, I THINK THIS

1238
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,766
"BRADY BUNCH" IS GOING TO BECOME

1239
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,935
VERY DISFUNCTIONAL VERY QUICKLY.

1240
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,313
I THINK I GOT VERY COMFORTABLE

1241
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,566
THINKING WE'RE SIX AND THEY'RE

1242
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,567
THREE AND THEN YOU START

1243
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,569
THINKING IT DOESN'T END AT THIS.

1244
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,820
IT REALLY BEGINS AT THIS BECAUSE

1245
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,030
SOMETHING HAS TO BREAK AND

1246
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:44,864
THAT'S WHAT I ANTICIPATE IS

1247
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,239
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1248
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,490
>> Jeff: IT WILL HAPPEN.

1249
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,118
THE QUESTION IS WHEN?

1250
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,078
IT COULD HAPPEN TONIGHT.

1251
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,247
IF IT DID, THAT WOULD BE

1252
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,457
SOMETHING I WOULD BE COMPLETELY

1253
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:54,749
UNAWARE OF.

1254
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,667
BUT EVERY TIME I COME TO TRIBAL

1255
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,461
COUNCIL, THIS PLACE GOES CRAZY.

1256
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,130
BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO FUN

1257
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,008
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR

1258
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,717
STOMACH SICK AT THE SAME TIME.

1259
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,426
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1260
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,427
TO VOTE.

1261
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:23,277
WOO, YOU'RE UP.

1262
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:34,246
>> FINGERS CROSSED.

1263
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:51,055
HERE'S TO ANOTHER BLINDSIDE.

1264
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:56,268
.

1265
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,605
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1266
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,483
VOTES.

1267
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,277
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1268
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,320
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1269
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:16,163
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1270
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:16,747
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1271
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,374
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1272
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,167
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1273
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,418
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1274
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,169
COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY.

1275
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,463
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1276
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:30,553
FIRST VOTE, L.J.

00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:39,520
THAT'S THREE VOTES L.J.

1280
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,858
