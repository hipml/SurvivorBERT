00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,585
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously,

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,586
on<i> Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,587
>> Screwed you, didn't I?

4
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,296
>> You didn't screw me.

5
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,172
I'm still in the game.

6
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:06,589
You screwed Leann.

7
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,173
>> PROBST: While Ami felt

8
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,384
betrayed after her ally Leann

9
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,969
was voted out, Twila and Scout

10
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,220
felt good about what they had

11
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,221
done.

12
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,973
>> We've overthrown the queen.

13
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,182
I have a great mind sometimes.

14
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:16,808
I love it.

15
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,308
>> PROBST: At the reward

16
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,101
challenge...

17
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,228
>> No way.

18
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,354
>> PROBST: ...the tribe learned

19
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,522
that the first-place finisher

20
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,648
would win a new car.

21
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,524
>> Nice.

22
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,984
>> PROBST: And that the winner

23
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,110
and the two runners-up would

24
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,528
drive to the other side of the

25
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,197
island for a night of pampering.

26
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,783
Survivors ready... go!

27
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,160
Ami first in to dive

28
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,161
for her flag.

29
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,455
Ami led the entire race, but in

30
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,247
the end...

31
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:39,497
Nice job.

32
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,041
...Eliza came away with the car

33
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,668
and Ami placed second.

34
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,920
Chris, the third-place finisher

35
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,797
going on the overnight reward.

36
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,298
(cheering)

37
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,592
Eliza, Ami and Chris drove to a

38
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,468
luxury spot.

39
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,218
>> Oh, my gosh.

40
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,219
>> And enjoyed a hot shower,

41
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,388
local entertainment...

42
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,389
>> I'm not stopping anytime

43
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,390
soon.

44
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,058
>> ...and an all-you-can-

45
00:00:59,142 --> 00:00:59,476
eat gourmet dinner.

46
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,268
>> Listen...

47
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,729
>> PROBST: Ami worked strategy

48
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,480
on Chris and Eliza.

49
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,981
>> I think it would be

50
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,191
really smart for you guys, is to

51
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:06,733
break up Scout and Twila.

52
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,109
>> PROBST: But Chris wasn't

53
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,152
about to let Ami stay

54
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,153
in the game.

55
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:10,737
>> Does she think I'm stupid,

56
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,279
you know?

57
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,280
She's still working Eliza,

58
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,281
though.

59
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,908
She's strategizing.

60
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,993
We're pure final four and look

61
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,912
at our competition, a 60-year-

62
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,705
old woman and Twila.

63
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,915
I'm counting on the fact that

64
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:22,916
Eliza is mentally strong.

65
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,000
>> Good night, Chris.

66
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,210
>> PROBST: But when Ami was

67
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,252
alone with Eliza, the strategy

68
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,379
talk continued.

69
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,048
>> Every single time I've

70
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:30,757
had your back.

71
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,341
>> ELIZA: Ami has stood up for

72
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,092
me a lot of times.

73
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:33,676
Ami has been like a big sister

74
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,553
to me out here.

75
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,805
>> PROBST: At the Immunity

76
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,348
Challenge, it came down to Chris

77
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,933
and Ami...

78
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,225
Chris is on!

79
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,184
...but Ami couldn't come

80
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,185
through.

81
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,354
Chris wins immunity.

82
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,522
And Chris was safe for three

83
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,650
more days.

84
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,275
Back at camp, Eliza considered

85
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,194
siding with Ami and Julie to

86
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,195
vote out Scout.

87
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,197
>> Oh, she would be so mad.

88
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,407
I'm not afraid to change things

89
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,659
if I think that it's going to

90
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,910
get me farther in this game.

91
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,662
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

92
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,329
Ami confronted Twila about

93
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,957
swearing on her son's name and

94
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,542
then breaking their alliance.

95
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,292
>> TWILA: I am not the only

96
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,378
friggin' person that has lied in

97
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:08,628
this game.

98
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,171
You've been had.

99
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,172
Screw you.

100
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,382
>> But when you bring in

101
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,591
the one thing that you say is

102
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,926
the most sacred thing to you in

103
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,135
the world, to me that is not

104
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,137
worth a million dollars.

105
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,221
>> PROBST: And though Eliza

106
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,848
agreed with Ami about Twila's

107
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,015
deception...

108
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,558
>> Twila swore on her son,

109
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,393
the one thing that someone

110
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,435
could say to convince me.

111
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,562
I'm, like, "Oh, well, then

112
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,688
they must be true to their

113
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,689
word."

114
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,481
>> PROBST: ...she cast a vote

115
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,358
against her big sister.

116
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,193
Ami, the tribe has spoken.

117
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,737
Five are left.

118
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,406
Who will be voted out tonight?

119
00:02:36,489 --> 00:03:52,315
(theme song playing)

120
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,692
>> It's a light night out.

121
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,486
>> Incredibly beautiful

122
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,446
night.

123
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,114
>> After Tribal Council, we got

124
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:00,740
back to the camp and everything

125
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,324
was good.

126
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,202
Ami was gone, one less worry and

127
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,662
I'm the last man standing.

128
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,080
It seemed like it was going

129
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,373
to be just a quiet, you know,

130
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,041
easy-going night, but there was

131
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,459
still a lot of emotion stirring

132
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,461
in Twila.

133
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,296
The fact that Eliza had brought

134
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,339
up Twila swearing on her son's

135
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,340
name.

136
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,383
>> Sorry, T.

137
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,301
>> You don't know how bad

138
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,719
I feel about saying that, and

139
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,221
then you just keep rubbing salt

140
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:23,805
in the wound, which is fine.

141
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,181
>> You know what...

142
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,474
>> But the only one I want to

143
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,934
worry about it with is my son,

144
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,643
when I go home.

145
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,811
>> We're all dropping it,

146
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,020
completely, and I'm sorry

147
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,021
I brought it up.

148
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:32,605
>> Because I am, you

149
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,356
know, I'm sorry I ever

150
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,357
said it.

151
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,109
I am so sorry that I ever made

152
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:36,484
that statement.

153
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,485
I am tired of it.

154
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,487
I'm tired of hearing about it,

155
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,488
period.

156
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,490
The only one that I've got to

157
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,533
condole with or say anything to

158
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,701
is my son when I get home.

159
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,702
The rest of you mother ... can

160
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,036
kiss my ... period.

161
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,954
>> Yeah, we're past it

162
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:48,913
and we're over it.

163
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,415
>> Yeah, everybody's over it.

164
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,541
>> I think that's a little

165
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,125
uncalled for.

166
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:52,959
>> I was apologizing.

167
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:53,626
I was apologizing.

168
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,460
There's no need to...

169
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,712
>> I think it's a lot

170
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,713
called for, Julie.

171
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,714
>> Why?

172
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,339
>> You all keep ... dogging me

173
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:58,923
about this ... and I'm sick of

174
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,340
it.

175
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,842
>> Your son?

176
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,592
>> So let it go.

177
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,969
>> I haven't... your son?

178
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:03,219
>> Yes.

179
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,220
>> I haven't brought up

180
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:04,554
your son once.

181
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,557
>> Oh, ...

182
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,057
>> Twila's outburst really

183
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,392
looked like a heinous

184
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,727
insecurity just projected on us.

185
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,936
And I'm actually kind of glad

186
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,104
she did it, 'cause I know it

187
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:13,730
completely turned everybody off

188
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,481
and I'm going to use it against

189
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,483
her later on.

190
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,193
That was so uncalled for.

191
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:19,569
>> That was so...

192
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,571
I was apologizing for

193
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,530
bringing up something that she

194
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,406
didn't want me to bring up.

195
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:23,823
>> You know what?

196
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,490
>> And she was like,

197
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,450
"Mother... go to hell."

198
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,368
I'm like, "Oh, my God."

199
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:27,618
>> I know.

200
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,412
>> It's shocking.

201
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,663
Nobody speaks to me like that.

202
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,914
Nobody speaks to me like that,

203
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,415
and I don't...

204
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,417
I don't tolerate it.

205
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,668
I guess Twila got a little upset

206
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,961
at Tribal Council, but she got

207
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:37,879
even more upset when we got

208
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,006
back and she was cursing at me.

209
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,133
Yes, I brought up the fact that

210
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,509
she swore on her son to both me

211
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,554
and somebody else, and one of

212
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,972
those times it was a lie, so it

213
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:48,598
made me wary of the fact that

214
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,476
she had sworn on her son to me.

215
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,102
You know, she's the one who did

216
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,103
it.

217
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,271
If you can't live with your past

218
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:55,897
actions, you shouldn't have done

219
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,566
it.

220
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,831
(thumping)

221
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,842
>> Good morning.

222
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,357
>> Against herself,

223
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,358
towards us, more so towards you.

224
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,193
>> Mm-hmm.

225
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,445
>> I knew that it wasn't

226
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,571
a good thing what Twila was

227
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,823
doing.

228
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,242
She definitely offended Julie.

229
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,493
She definitely offended Eliza.

230
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,745
Eliza being part of this four-

231
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,538
person alliance with Scout,

232
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,915
Twila and myself, you know, it's

233
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,458
important to try to keep a

234
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,502
level, you know, understanding.

235
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,045
She's taken a road she doesn't

236
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:01,712
need to take.

237
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,797
It's dangerous for her position

238
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,799
in the game.

239
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,800
>> Why would it be a big

240
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,468
deal to vote Twila off instead

241
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,054
of me?

242
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,141
>> I don't know.

243
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,016
>> Just from your perspective,

244
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,312
your position.

245
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,313
>> I don't know.

246
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,314
>> Yeah.

247
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,024
>> I don't think it would.

248
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,025
I would definitely consider

249
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,027
making a deal with Julie.

250
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,362
Sometimes when it's in your best

251
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:26,988
interest to abandon an alliance,

252
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,948
you have to do that to get

253
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,201
yourself further in the game.

254
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,831
>> Right.

255
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,790
I mean, Chris is like either/or,

256
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,666
'cause he could win against me.

257
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,459
And if anything, Twila's his

258
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,711
semi-competition, and I'll talk

259
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,670
to him about it.

260
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,713
>> Just say, "Oh, I mentioned

261
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,174
it to Eliza and I told her I

262
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,383
was going to talk to you."

263
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:47,842
Don't say...

264
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,634
>> I'm not gonna... yeah,

265
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,094
I'm not saying you're agreeing.

266
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:50,720
All day I've been shuffling my

267
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,638
ideas and my plan to Eliza.

268
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,182
I've been playing up the fact

269
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,349
that we want to get rid

270
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,351
of Twila.

271
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,603
But her only dilemma is that she

272
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,146
is going to be faithful to Chris

273
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,480
and if Chris doesn't buy it,

274
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,481
then there's no point.

275
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,233
So I have to approach Chris in

276
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,320
an appropriate time and manner.

277
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:07,904
You know, it's all benching on

278
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,655
that for me.

279
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,781
It could either continue my game

280
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:21,042
or end it abruptly.

281
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:29,425
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

282
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:29,675
Okay.

283
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,011
Today's reward challenge will

284
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,721
give you a second chance with

285
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,181
some challenges you have tackled

286
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,933
in the past.

287
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,351
All five of you will go through

288
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,435
the mud pit.

289
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:39,977
The first four to get to the

290
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,729
other side move on to the

291
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,730
next round.

292
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,606
Those four will tackle the

293
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,565
pigpen, where you must get

294
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,943
inside the pigpen, get a pig and

295
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,277
get that pig in its cage.

296
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,029
The first three to do this move

297
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,489
on to the next round, where you

298
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,573
must put together a Tiki puzzle.

299
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,992
The first two to correctly solve

300
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,077
the Tiki puzzle move to the

301
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,994
final round.

302
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:57,662
The last two will race up and

303
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,164
across a balance beam, down the

304
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:00,790
other side where, using a

305
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,125
slingshot, you must break three

306
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,126
tiles.

307
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,294
You'll raise a torch, torch will

308
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,420
light the wok, you win reward.

309
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:06,921
>> Wow.

310
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,047
>> PROBST: Want to know what

311
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,839
you're playing for?

312
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,882
>> Yes.

313
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,133
>> PROBST: For the winner, you

314
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,301
will take a horseback ride.

315
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:12,843
>> Ooh!

316
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,761
>> My favorite.

317
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,929
>> PROBST: And you will end up

318
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,472
at Mount Yasur, one of the most

319
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,682
active volcanoes in the world.

320
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,558
Of course, you'll have a little

321
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,227
snack fitting for volcano

322
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,853
viewing: hot dogs.

323
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,355
>> Oh, my God, Jeff.

324
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,231
>> PROBST: Wine and/or hot

325
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,108
chocolate and beer.

326
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,485
You'll spend the night at Mount

327
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,194
Yasur.

328
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:30,945
Worth playing for?

329
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:31,737
>> Yes.

330
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,738
>> PROBST: All right.

331
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,739
We're going to draw numbers for

332
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:33,990
position.

333
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,825
We'll get started.

334
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,789
First four through the mud pit

335
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,374
move on to the next round.

336
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,918
Survivors, ready.

337
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,920
Go!

338
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,633
Chris, Twila, Eliza with a

339
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,552
slight lead and then Julie and

340
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,970
then Scout.

341
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,847
Twila and Eliza.

342
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,725
Chris bringing it on.

343
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,351
Julie struggling, but she's

344
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,602
still ahead of Scout.

345
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,146
First four across, Chris is

346
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,481
across, Eliza is across, Twila

347
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,692
is across and Julie moving on to

348
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,653
the next round.

349
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,030
Scout is the first one

350
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,573
eliminated.

351
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,991
Here we go, the first three to

352
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,451
catch a pig that has an orange

353
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,244
stripe and get that pig in its

354
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,704
cage moves on to the next round.

355
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,706
Survivors ready.

356
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,791
Go!

357
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,337
(pigs squealing)

358
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,047
Chris has one.

359
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,173
(squealing)

360
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,382
Julie and Eliza fighting for

361
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,508
one.

362
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,092
Eliza had it and she lost it.

363
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,219
Julie has one.

364
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:37,720
Chris is in.

365
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,388
>> Go, Twila.

366
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,222
Go, go, go.

367
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,725
>> PROBST: Julie is moving on.

368
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,726
And Twila moving on to the

369
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,727
next round.

370
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,187
>> Nice try, honey.

371
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,188
>> PROBST: Eliza's out.

372
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:47,897
First two to correctly get their

373
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,733
Tiki put together move on.

374
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,651
Survivors, ready.

375
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,945
Go!

376
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,114
Got to untie knots, take the

377
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,407
puzzle apart and then put it

378
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:58,866
back together again.

379
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,869
Chris and Twila wasting no time.

380
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,162
Julie going to untie all her

381
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,205
knots first.

382
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,040
Julie has all the knots undone.

383
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,459
Chris has all his pieces off,

384
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,710
Julie right behind...

385
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,003
Twila right behind.

386
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,296
Chris is going to do his on the

387
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,130
ground.

388
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,758
First two move on.

389
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,597
>> I think I got it.

390
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,562
>> PROBST: That's not right.

391
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,733
Two people are moving on to the

392
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,610
final.

393
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,611
>> Please say yes.

394
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,695
>> PROBST: Twila's right.

395
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,655
She's moving on.

396
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:37,988
>> Yes, whoo!

397
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,533
>> Way to go, Twila!

398
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,700
>> PROBST: Chris, trying to

399
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,744
figure out where he's

400
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,746
gone wrong.

401
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,581
Julie's right, moving on.

402
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,291
Julie and Twila in the final.

403
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,835
Chris, one piece over there you

404
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,378
never used.

405
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,421
This piece right here.

406
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,549
>> No, I didn't see that.

407
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,008
>> PROBST: Final two, Twila and

408
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,261
Julie, for a horseback ride to

409
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,178
Mount Yasur.

410
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,847
Survivors, ready.

411
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,015
Go!

412
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,811
Twila trips on the ladder, Julie

413
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,812
with a little bit of a lead.

414
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,813
Got to get across this

415
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,857
balance beam.

416
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:19,405
Julie is first over.

417
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,781
Twila still doing well on the

418
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,740
beam.

419
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,826
Time to catch up.

420
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,414
Julie untying her slingshot.

421
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,999
Twila took a big fall on the

422
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,042
net, she's hurt.

423
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,674
Julie untying the slingshot.

424
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,341
Twila making short order

425
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,342
of the knot.

426
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,552
Twila starting to catch up.

427
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,053
Julie has her slingshot, got to

428
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,472
break three plates, releasing

429
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,307
them from the wires.

430
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,349
Julie is going to get the first

431
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,184
shot in.

432
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,187
Twila right behind.

433
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,105
Julie, with one shot, breaks her

434
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:53,856
first plate.

435
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,358
>> Way to go, Julie.

436
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,443
>> PROBST: Julie lines up for

437
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,736
her second shot.

438
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,280
Julie breaks her second plate.

439
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,032
Twila breaks her first plate.

440
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:03,491
>> I'm winning this.

441
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,033
>> PROBST: Julie says she's

442
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,576
going to win it.

443
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,952
She's got one plate left...

444
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:07,912
and she does.

445
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,747
(scattered cheers)

446
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,956
Julie going to Mount Yasur.

447
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,000
>> Way to go, Julie.

448
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,002
>> PROBST: All right, Julie,

449
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:15,711
nice effort.

450
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,295
You're going to Mount Yasur--

451
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,005
horseback ride, hot dogs, beer.

452
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,216
Who you taking with you?

453
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
>> Well, it's ironic, 'cause

454
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,593
none of these people would've

455
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,969
taken me, so I'm gonna

456
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,848
take Chris.

457
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,644
(groans): Oh... brother.

458
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,561
>> PROBST: All right.

459
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,396
You three, nice effort.

460
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,315
Heading back to camp muddy.

461
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,318
Head on out.

462
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,494
>> Julie won the reward.

463
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,037
And she picked me, and we

464
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,913
cleaned up after the muddy

465
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,582
challenge we went through.

466
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,583
And we journeyed through the

467
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,834
jungle and we finally come out

468
00:13:55,918 --> 00:14:00,089
into this extremely ashy, dense

469
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,342
area.

470
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,386
>> Wow.

471
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,929
>> Lord, that thing is mammoth.

472
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,888
>> The decision to bring

473
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,723
Chris-- I knew none of them were

474
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,100
going to bring me-- but Chris I

475
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,687
had the funnest with, I needed

476
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,772
to talk to, and he's my door to

477
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,190
open to get me further in this

478
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,775
game, so it only made sense to

479
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:20,818
bring Chris.

480
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,569
>> Hello.

481
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,027
>> Hello, hello.

482
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:28,075
>> Julie.

483
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,285
>> Joe? Okay.

484
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,578
>> Okay, Joe.

485
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,579
>> Let's go.

486
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,580
Let's take a walk up there.

487
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:37,209
>> Okay, let's go.

488
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,502
>> Oh, yeah!

489
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,878
>> Oh, Chris, can you

490
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,629
believe it?

491
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,341
>> This is beautiful.

492
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,552
>> Wow. Wow.

493
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,053
Whoa.

494
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:48,971
Hope you make it.

495
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,016
>> He's awful nervous.

496
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,563
>> There was one part

497
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,856
when we were crossing the river,

498
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,481
okay, and Chris is in the river

499
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,024
just looking around.

500
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,318
And he just looked so hopeless

501
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,611
out there, I just couldn't

502
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,612
help but laugh.

503
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,404
>> He's not wanting to go

504
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,363
nowhere.

505
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,406
>> Yeah? Just give a kick.

506
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,365
Kick on the side.

507
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,491
(clicking tongue)

508
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,618
>> Kick him?

509
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,785
>> Kick, yeah.

510
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,620
Stronger.

511
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,120
>> This horse and me had

512
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:13,954
trouble getting to know each

513
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,080
other at first, you know?

514
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,791
It took us a while to, you know,

515
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,418
build a trusting relationship.

516
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,669
Go.

517
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,254
Whoa!

518
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,589
So, okay, well, off to a little

519
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,882
bit of a rough start on the

520
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:25,966
horse, but everything else went

521
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,259
great.

522
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,552
This is beautiful.

523
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,261
>> Isn't it?

524
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,512
>> We walked down this

525
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,431
long trail, and it was awesome

526
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,557
just looking at everything on

527
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,602
our way up.

528
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,824
>> Finally, we come around

529
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,952
the far side of Mount Yasur.

530
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:54,870
>> Here we are.

531
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,538
This is your hut for the night.

532
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:56,997
>> Ow!

533
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:57,998
Oh, my God!

534
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,167
I see foot-long hot dogs, huge

535
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,961
rolls, onions and relish, wine,

536
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,380
beer.

537
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,589
We are thrilled, so we're like,

538
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,590
"Okay, what can we do?

539
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,216
Let's get going."

540
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,259
>> Guys...

541
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,390
>> Yeah.

542
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,015
Joe comes back and he's, like,

543
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,892
"Bring the hot dogs.

544
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:17,726
We're going to heat them

545
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,102
in the vent."

546
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,186
You look around, there's all

547
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,688
these steam vents coming up.

548
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,980
It was probably about ten feet

549
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:22,815
away.

550
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,109
>> This is nice and warm.

551
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,068
>> Oh, wow.

552
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,111
>> Nice and hot, see?

553
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:27,653
>> Is it hot enough it'll

554
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,862
cook this?

555
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,196
>> Yes. Sure.

556
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,033
>> Great little oven.

557
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,412
>> Oh! I'm sorry.

558
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,413
That is hot.

559
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,330
>> Yeah.

560
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,123
We go over to the vent,

561
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,416
and put some corn in the bottom,

562
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,250
and just stick them in.

563
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,167
Three minutes later,

564
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:42,501
they're ready.

565
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,128
>> Okay...

566
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,170
Oh, yeah, look at that.

567
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:45,963
>> You think?

568
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,964
>> Yeah. Take a bite.

569
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,465
Mine's cooked.

570
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,008
>> We'll leave the corns for...

571
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,468
>> God, oh, my God.

572
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,555
So we doll up our rolls and we

573
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,765
ate just four hot dogs nonstop,

574
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,100
foot-long, great, yum.

575
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,351
I was in heaven.

576
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,185
Oh, my God, Chris.

577
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,229
>> You know, Julie won

578
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,063
the reward.

579
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,523
It didn't surprise me that she

580
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,232
picked me.

581
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,316
She wants to go further in the

582
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,526
game, and she knows that her

583
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,152
name is coming up for

584
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,320
elimination.

585
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,488
>> Are you a lot tighter

586
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,406
with Twila than I thought

587
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,407
you were?

588
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,492
>> Um... no, I've never

589
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,327
been real tight with Twila.

590
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,329
>> Right. So who do you

591
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,706
feel most loyal to?

592
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,248
>> Since the merge, you.

593
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,584
You've never done nothing...

594
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,960
you've done nothing but help me

595
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:25,878
since then.

596
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,503
I see that.

597
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,796
I know that.

598
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,422
Me and Julie got a little bit

599
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,090
of, you know, a bond between us,

600
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,800
you know.

601
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,843
She let me know that she doesn't

602
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:33,802
want to leave.

603
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,386
She wants to stay in the game.

604
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,013
>> Eliza's like, "I'm

605
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,222
aligned with everyone, but Chris

606
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,599
is the only one... if you talk

607
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,808
to him then I'll consider."

608
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,476
She's like, "I'll go along with

609
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,436
it if Chris goes along with it."

610
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,437
>> Well, that's because

611
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,688
she told me I'm the only one

612
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,230
she trusts now.

613
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:45,731
>> Right.

614
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,648
>> I don't know, Julie worked

615
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,608
it pretty good.

616
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,650
There's nothing that Julie or

617
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,611
Eliza would like more than for

618
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,236
me to jump on their side and

619
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,279
vote off Twila.

620
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,407
And I didn't tell her no.

621
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,283
I'm the last guy standing.

622
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,077
I sit and I think, "Is this a

623
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,621
bad thing or a good thing?"

624
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,414
I just haven't decided yet.

625
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,165
Sure, I mean, I know darn well

626
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,375
you could influence Eliza.

627
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,210
>> Yeah.

628
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,711
>> Without a doubt.

629
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,337
And, yeah, the three of us could

630
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,506
completely turn the game around.

631
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,465
>> Chris was very open-minded

632
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,257
and he's open to help me

633
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,676
progress in the game, so Chris

634
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,387
is my rock right now.

635
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,394
>> Get them bananas over

636
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,479
here and just start cutting

637
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,814
some of them up and put them in

638
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,898
a soup just so they don't

639
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,899
go to waste.

640
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:29,900
>> You want to bury the

641
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,901
other ones?

642
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,652
>> The big ones?

643
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,736
>> Yeah. Where are they?

644
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,737
>> Did I unbury them or

645
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,780
do you want to bury the

646
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,280
rest of them?

647
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:35,739
>> No, did you unbury?

648
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,533
>> Nope, I didn't.

649
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,158
>> Where are they?

650
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,159
>> I'm not telling.

651
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,702
>> T...?

652
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,703
>> If you ask me one more

653
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,704
time, I'm going to let the damn

654
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,207
things rot in the ground.

655
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,416
>> Twila has been telling

656
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,460
us that she hid these bananas.

657
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,712
She buried them in order to help

658
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,214
them ripen and won't tell us

659
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,799
where they are.

660
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,675
>> Are you hungry for a

661
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,551
banana, little one?

662
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,260
>> I'm over the fact that

663
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,387
she's saying, "Oh, we're going

664
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,013
to let them rot in the ground."

665
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,431
It's so patronizing.

666
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,224
>> You're acting like a

667
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,433
kid, though. Get over it.

668
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,226
>> Why are you being so

669
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,269
childish about the damn bananas?

670
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,187
>> She don't want you to

671
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,188
have the bananas yet, honey.

672
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,314
>> Wearing me slick.

673
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,357
>> She's saving those

674
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,150
bananas so we all have something

675
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:12,651
to eat at breakfast each

676
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,902
morning.

677
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,695
>> I'll just go bury the

678
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,821
rest of them and then let you

679
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,406
know if I decide I want to tell

680
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,991
you where they are.

681
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,241
>> Okay.

682
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,076
>> Oh, my God.

683
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,661
>> Touché.

684
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,662
She got you.

685
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,830
She got you, Twila.

686
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,375
(laughing)

687
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,585
>> For Scout, for Twila,

688
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,210
for me, it's just gotten to the

689
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,630
point where we cannot hold back

690
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,299
anymore and especially Twila.

691
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,093
She's just so childish and

692
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,304
immature and so obnoxious and

693
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,221
annoying, and I hate the way

694
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,264
she treats me.

695
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,432
I hate...

696
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,643
I mean, oh, my God.

697
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,561
>> It just don't make no

698
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,645
sense why she's being so

699
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,396
freakin' childish over it.

700
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,397
I don't care.

701
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,440
They can stay in the ground and

702
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,859
rot, I ain't digging 'em up now.

703
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,235
It's her way or no way.

704
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,029
Forget that.

705
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,740
>> I'm so sick of Twila.

706
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,368
I just want her to go home now.

707
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,546
>> Full moon, Chris.

708
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,257
>> Awesome.

709
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,383
>> It's like a challenge

710
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,302
all over again.

711
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,095
>> No kidding.

712
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:22,638
>> It's going to be great.

713
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,515
I like watching this.

714
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,775
>> Oh, wow.

715
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,359
>> Do you see?

716
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,360
>> Yeah, that is awesome.

717
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,278
So Joe comes back and, you know,

718
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,112
we're like, okay.

719
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:39,988
He goes, "Look, I'm going to

720
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,864
take you up here."

721
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,490
So we all three took off up this

722
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,491
little trail up the volcano.

723
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,034
Watch the rocks.

724
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,118
>> Oh, my God, Chris.

725
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,286
>> Oh...

726
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,332
>> Oh, my God.

727
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,833
Do you believe it?

728
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,834
>> This is where we're

729
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,335
going to sit and watch.

730
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,753
>> No way.

731
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,462
Julie, do you see how close we

732
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,547
are now?

733
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,468
>> I know.

734
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,886
Oh, my God.

735
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,470
Gosh.

736
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:03,720
>> No way.

737
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:08,141
>> Oh, my...

738
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:08,684
>> It's like a time bomb.

739
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,185
>> It is.

740
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:10,686
This is definitely like

741
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,354
fireworks.

742
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,563
>> It was amazing because

743
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,439
every time the volcano erupted,

744
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,650
the volcanic rock would shoot

745
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,484
out and it just glowed.

746
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,152
It was like the Fourth of July.

747
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,364
Oh, granny, give us a big one.

748
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,701
>> Oh...

749
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,535
I saw a volcano exploding the

750
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,745
whole night.

751
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,746
It was one of the most beautiful

752
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,918
things I've ever witnessed.

753
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,337
>> There is absolutely no

754
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,922
other experience in my life I

755
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,339
can compare it to.

756
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,717
>> Wow.

757
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,759
>> I don't know if I'll

758
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,885
ever have another experience

759
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,636
like it.

760
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,387
I mean, how often do you get to

761
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,431
sit at the mouth of a volcano

762
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:52,686
and watch it explode?

763
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,063
Is it talking to us or what?

764
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,940
>> It's saying good-bye.

765
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,608
>> Got me scared.

766
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,694
I had to turn around.

767
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,457
>> Just about home.

768
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,208
>> Oh, I see Chris and

769
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,168
Jules coming.

770
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,753
(animal call)

771
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,629
>> Coming, slowpoke?

772
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,089
>> I just filled your

773
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:21,465
water jug, J.B.

774
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,467
I don't know where yours is

775
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,181
or I'd fill it for you.

776
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:29,556
>> I knew that.

777
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,143
I'm glad, yeah.

778
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:33,935
>> Where's Twila?

779
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:34,603
How is her foot?

780
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,562
I've been thinking about her.

781
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,189
After the reward this morning,

782
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,065
we come back to camp.

783
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:38,607
Right away, you know, Scout

784
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,735
hugged me and she's thinking the

785
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,778
same thing I'm thinking.

786
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,029
It's game time.

787
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,489
I just let her know nothing has

788
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,448
changed.

789
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,532
We're all four together and

790
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,701
then, you know, Twila.

791
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,786
She's a basket case.

792
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:56,875
You've got to reassure her.

793
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,211
>> Coming back to camp

794
00:22:59,294 --> 00:22:59,669
was perfect.

795
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,879
Everything fell together.

796
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:01,546
Everyone's thinking on the same

797
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,882
terms, keeping an eye on things.

798
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,467
That's what I got to do.

799
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,594
>> Come sit and talk to

800
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,595
me for a minute.

801
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,389
I was thrilled to get Julie and

802
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,557
Chris back because presumably

803
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,810
Julie has spoken to Chris about

804
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,686
voting for Twila.

805
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,063
And if Chris is going to go for

806
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,481
it, then I might go for it also.

807
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,817
>> Everything is good.

808
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,610
Julie picked me for strategy.

809
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,320
She's worried about her spot

810
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:25,904
in the game.

811
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,530
She knows that us four have

812
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,156
an alliance.

813
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,032
>> Right, right.

814
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,784
So if any one of the four of us

815
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,620
wins immunity, we're voting

816
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,372
Julie off.

817
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,790
>> I don't know.

818
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,459
Depends on, you know, our best

819
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,627
interest in the game and how far

820
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,629
we can go.

821
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,090
I think without a doubt Twila is

822
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,258
gonna stick with Scout, Scout is

823
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,467
gonna stick with Twila.

824
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,510
>> Oh, yeah, definitely.

825
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,762
>> That-that worries me

826
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,513
a little bit.

827
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,098
>> But if Julie stays in

828
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,016
the game, we're automatically in

829
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,767
the final three.

830
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,310
>> I'm open-minded to

831
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,770
exactly what you said, because,

832
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,272
you know, me and Julie have

833
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,273
talked and we had discussed

834
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,357
us three...

835
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,858
>> Mm-hmm.

836
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,401
>> ...as being better for

837
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,153
all three of us.

838
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:12,659
>> Mm-hmm.

839
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:12,868
>> Yeah.

840
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,577
I sat down with Eliza on the

841
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,578
beach.

842
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,539
We went over a scenario about

843
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,540
me, her and Julie taking

844
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,541
out Twila.

845
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,918
I mean, I don't trust Scout.

846
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,044
I don't trust Twila.

847
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,129
I don't trust Eliza.

848
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:24,629
I don't trust Julie, and

849
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,425
they don't trust each other.

850
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,509
And the most screwed-up thing

851
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,178
about it is, I think they all

852
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,179
trust me.

853
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,723
So... it's... it's getting

854
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,057
really crazy.

855
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,559
I've probably made it this way

856
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,477
myself because I am playing

857
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,812
both sides.

858
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,229
Everything's good.

859
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,814
We'll just have to see how this

860
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,316
immunity challenge goes, and,

861
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,443
you know, if it falls in the

862
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,527
right direction, we'll talk and

863
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,613
do what's best for<i> us...</i>

864
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,448
to the final three.

865
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,324
>> Oh, yeah.

866
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,158
To the final two.

867
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,285
>> Well, yeah, I mean, right.

868
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,746
>> Yeah.

869
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,340
>> PROBST: Go ahead and have

870
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,257
a seat, guys.

871
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:09,966
Ready for today's Immunity

872
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,967
Challenge?

873
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:11,968
>> Mm-hmm.

874
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:12,969
>> PROBST: First things first,

875
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:13,970
Chris.

876
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,680
Give it up.

877
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,392
Immunity back up for grabs.

878
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,852
For today's immunity challenge,

879
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,312
I'm gonna tell you a story about

880
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,730
a legendary man in these parts,

881
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,773
and then you're gonna have to

882
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,608
answer a series of questions.

883
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,567
Ready for the story?

884
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,526
>> Yeah.

885
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,653
>> PROBST: All right, back in

886
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,071
the 1200s, this guy Chief Roy

887
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,239
Mata comes to this land,

888
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,240
conquers it.

889
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,158
His first goal was to bring

890
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,701
peace by uniting all of the

891
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,702
tribes, and he accomplished

892
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,037
that.

893
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,621
But sadly, the peace didn't

894
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,580
last very long.

895
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,707
15 years later, Roy Mata was

896
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,709
murdered, not by an enemy or a

897
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,753
rival chief, but by his own

898
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,337
brother.

899
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,588
Now, it certainly wasn't

900
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,674
forbidden to bury a chief on the

901
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,509
land that he ruled, but the

902
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,010
locals were so afraid of the

903
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,679
power of the spirit of Roy Mata

904
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,264
that they took the body to a

905
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,848
remote location and they buried

906
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,600
him there with his 18 assistant

907
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,019
chiefs, their wives and all of

908
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,562
Roy Mata's wives.

909
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,106
Before being buried alive, the

910
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,400
men were given a strong brew of

911
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,651
kava, not because it was

912
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,027
customary but because it put

913
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,696
them in a dream-like relaxed

914
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,196
state.

915
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,447
The women, however, were

916
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,740
strangled to death before being

917
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:16,324
buried.

918
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,410
Once the ceremony was complete,

919
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,078
the land was declared taboo, and

920
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,663
nobody visited for seven

921
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,539
centuries.

922
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,124
One footnote, the name Roy Mata,

923
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,208
not a popular name today.

924
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:25,834
In fact, it has never been used

925
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,751
since.

926
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,711
That is your story.

927
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,629
Your challenge now to see how

928
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,630
much of that information you've

929
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,631
retained.

930
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,008
Here's how it'll work.

931
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,592
There are six huts scattered in

932
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:34,968
the jungle.

933
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,303
You'll race to a hut where

934
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,304
you'll find a puzzle.

935
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,680
Put the puzzle together, which

936
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,432
has the question, read it and

937
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,808
then choose between answer A or

938
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,184
answer B.

939
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,436
Attached to each answer is a bag

940
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,979
full of tusks.

941
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,314
Without looking, reach in and

942
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:47,647
pull one out.

943
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,317
If you're wrong, you will grab a

944
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,485
black tusk, in which case you

945
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,070
have to race back to the center,

946
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,572
toss it in the urn and return to

947
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,906
the hut to answer the question

948
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,615
correctly.

949
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,284
If you're right, you'll grab a

950

white tusk, bring that back to

951
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,495
your post, put it on your

952
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:02,787
necklace.

953
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,997
There are six huts.

954

First person to get five answers

955
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,668
correctly wins immunity.

956
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,669

spot in the final four.

961

36 days of making it this far,

1043
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,735
tonight the game will end for

1044
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:21,277
one of you.

1045
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,987
I'll see you tonight at Tribal

1046
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:23,988
Council.

1047
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,658
Head on back to camp.

It's a great feeling.

1055

I'd like to win every immunity

1056

challenge from here on out.

1057
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,109
This is gonna be the first

1058
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,194
Tribal Council I haven't brought

1059
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,363
my bag to.

1060
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,990
I think that tonight Chris,

1061
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,659
Julie and I are going to shock

1062
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,202
the hell out of everyone and

1063
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,746
vote off Twila, and it's just...

1064
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,957
it's a really exciting prospect.

1065
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,375
Chris has proved me right so

1066
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,001
far, and I just hope he

1067
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,211
continues to do so.

1068
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,713
>> (indistinct talking)

1069
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,965
>> Yeah. Not a big deal.

1070

>> What are<i> they</i> talking

1071
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,136
about?

1072
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,138
>> I don't know.

1073
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,347
>> Putting a lot of trust

1074
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:31,973
in Chris, you know?

1075
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,141
He could guarantee himself a

1076
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,267
final-three spot with them.

1077
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,394
>> But... I don't think

1078

>> We're three, they're

1080
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,149
two.

1081
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,150
That's it.

1082
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,151
Case closed, right, Scout?

1083
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,068
>> Right, absolutely.

1084
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,820
>> Nothing stops us.

1085

>> If I'm going home,

1086
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,156
you'd better tell me.

>> You guys...

1088
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,201
I'm here because of you guys.

It's not changing.

1090
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,372
I mean, don't even doubt it.

1091
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,082
I would tell you, you got it?

1092
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,626
We're going all the way, to the

1093
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,001
final three.

1094
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,002
>> Okay.

1095
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,046
>> Scout and Twila are

1096
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,172
definitely convinced that

1097
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,299
Julie's the next to go.

1098
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,885
And then there's me.

1099
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,510
I'm still weighing my options,

1100
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,095
but I'm going back and forth

1101
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,222
like a teeter-totter, you know?

1102
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,557
I'm thinking, one moment I think

1103
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,183
I'm gonna keep Julie around, and

1104
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,435
the next moment, you know, I'm

1105
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,144
thinking maybe I better stick

1106
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,021
with Twila and Scout.

1107
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,481
Now, just listen to me.

1108
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,857
It's just a question.

1109
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,150
It's not what's gonna happen

1110
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,568
necessarily.

1111
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,904
If I decide to vote Julie off

1112
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,405
tonight because I think it's

1113
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,491
best for me and you, that

1114
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,242
doesn't affect me and your pact,

1115
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,243
right?

1116
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,036
>> The only thing is, you

1117
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,330
know Scout and Twila are not

1118
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,831
gonna go against each other.

1119
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,249
That means whichever one of us

1120
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,167
doesn't win immunity is going up

1121
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,711
against one of them, whichever

1122
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,254
one we decide to vote off first,

1123
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,547
in a challenge at Tribal

1124
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,548
Council.

1125
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,508
>> I know.

1126
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,342
>> That's what that means.

1127
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,718
And so yes, it doesn't affect

1128
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,928
our pact, but that means that

1129
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,346
one of the two of us could end

1130
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,931
up in the final three with two

1131
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,058
of them, meaning 100% we do not

1132
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,395
end up in the final two.

1133
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,105
>> I know, I know.

1134
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,022
>> What's up?

1135
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:08,695
>> I don't know, you tell me.

1136
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,445
What's up, Eliza?

1137
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,113
>> I don't know.

1138
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,280
I just feel like you're ...

1139
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,281
with me.

1140
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:12,740
>> You got immunity.

1141
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,950
>> You're right, I do

1142
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,575
have immunity tonight, but if I

1143
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,243
don't have immunity tomorrow

1144
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,120
night, then who's gone, T?

1145
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,579
I think you're a liar, T.

1146
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,123
>> Who else has been lying?

1147
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,207
Are you in this alliance with us

1148
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,750
to the end?

1149
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,127
>> I hadn't told a lie in

1150
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,128
this game.

1151
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,045
>> And have you been

1152
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,255
talking to Julie about anything,

1153
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,883
or is that just... that's okay

1154
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:31,509
for you to do?

1155
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,135
You said, swore to us that you

1156
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,220
was in this final-four alliance

1157
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,221
till the end, so what've you

1158
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,222
been talking to Julie about?

1159
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,056
>> Hey, I'm gonna listen

1160
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,265
to her.

1161
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,891
>> And you're not saying,

1162
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,517
"Okay, we would like to do this

1163
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,436
and this and get Twila and Scout

1164
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,395
out of here" or anything?

1165
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,563
>> I'm listening.

1166
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,564
I'm listening, and you know

1167
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,565
what?

1168
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,066
>> And you ain't said a word?

1169
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,984
>> I would consider it,

1170
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:48,860
because you've been trying to

1171
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,694
plot against me since day one.

1172
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,528
>> You've been on the

1173
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,988
edge for the last three
friggin'

1174
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:52,989
days.

1175
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:53,990
You're driving everybody

1176
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,991
friggin' nuts.

1177
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,951
Chill out.

1178
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,119
You got one night that you know

1179
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,203
you ain't going nowhere.

1180
00:33:59,287 --> 00:33:59,454
Enjoy it.

1181
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,664
>> I will.

1182
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,915
>> Now, Chris, what are

1183
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,291
you thinking?

1184
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,251
>> (laughs): What?

1185
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,003
I'm just laying here, you know,

1186
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:07,670
in the hammock.

1187
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,880
>> No, you was talking to...

1188
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:09,797
I just come up.

1189
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,423
I was just kind of listening to

1190
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,090
what was being said.

1191
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,175
>> I'm hearing Eliza out.

1192
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,801
She's talking to me.

1193
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,388
>> Okay.

1194
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,389
>> Everybody's scrambling.

1195
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,725
I just think I'm in a better

1196
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,144
position than, you know, Twila,

1197
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,729
Scout, Eliza, or Julie right now

1198
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,813
because I'm-I'm, I'm pretty much

1199
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,355
the middle man, as far as I

1200
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,106
know.

1201
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,192
You know, what them four have

1202
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,526
conspired or talked about, I

1203
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,527
don't know.

1204
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,070
I don't trust any of them.

1205
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,655
They're thick as thieves, man.

1206
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,406
They're all women.

1207
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,866
How do you trust any of them?

1208
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,367
So, I don't know what I'm going

1209
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,995
to do.

1210
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,246
I'm messing with both sides, but

1211
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,623
it's kind of easy to do right

1212
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,624
now.

1213
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,042
I need to do it to figure out

1214
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,210
what my best option is right

1215
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,211
now.

1216
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,462
It's probably in my best

1217
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,922
interest to go with you and

1218
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,298
Eliza because Scout and Twila

1219
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,966
are too thick.

1220
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,509
I haven't broke my word that

1221
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,469
often in this game and I thought

1222
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,054
I would be a cutthroat piece

1223
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,388
of...

1224
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,973
>> But isn't she easier

1225
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,099
to do that to than me?

1226
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,184
>> What I'm comparing

1227
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,477
this to is my friendship with

1228
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,812
you compared to my friendship

1229
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,187
with Twila.

1230
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:06,437
>> Right.

1231
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,189
>> And my friendship with

1232
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,524
you is a hell of a lot more than

1233
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,274
my-- I mean, come on.

1234
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,275
We've joked around, and, you

1235
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,276
know, I call you my little

1236
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,277
sister.

1237
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:13,820
It's just... it's totally

1238
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,320
different.

1239
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,030
We'll keep you.

1240
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,199
We're gonna vote off Twila.

1241
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,617
>> Chris approaches me.

1242
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,160
He says he's gonna straight-out

1243
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,037
vote for Twila, basically saying

1244
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,622
that our friendship is weighing

1245
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:28,626
on his decision tonight.

1246
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,086
I hope he keeps me around.

1247
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,003
That's all I can do.

1248
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:31,546
I don't know for sure.

1249
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,380
I'm not going to be<i> extremely</i>

1250
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,381
paranoid.

1251
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,049
I'm just really gonna be even

1252
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,676
keel and hope that it goes in my

1253
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,053
favor.

1254
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,512
>> I haven't liked the

1255
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,264
game since we merged.

1256
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,640
>> We have no reason to

1257
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:42,932
be stressed.

1258
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,767
I've made my decision.

1259
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,018
It's not gonna change.

1260
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,563
It's me, you, and Scout voting

1261
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,897
for Julie, and that's it.

1262
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,398
That's not gonna change.

1263
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,358
I'm not even hesitating.

1264
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,735
Me and Julie's become friends.

1265
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,739
I'm sending her home tonight.

1266
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,740
>> Chris has guaranteed

1267
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,741
me that I'm not going home

1268
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,742
tonight.

1269
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,910
Part of me wants to believe

1270
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,536
Chris wholeheartedly, but-- it's

1271
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,287
a game.

1272
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,247
I just cannot do it.

1273
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,874
I cannot let my guard down.

1274
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,166
You can't trust nobody now.

1275
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:09,834
Nobody.

1276
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,835
You're playing for a million

1277
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:11,836
dollars.

1278
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,129
People have murdered for

1279
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,463
less than a million dollars,

1280
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,089
you know?

1281
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:20,261
Come on.

1282
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,220
>> I'm excited to have immunity.

1283
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:26,517
>> I know, you ought to be.

1284
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,560
>> I told Julie that I'm

1285
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,185
keeping her.

1286
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,270
I told Twila that I'm keeping

1287
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,271
<i>her.</i>

1288
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,231
I'm gonna put myself in the best

1289
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,317
possible situation to win the

1290
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,776
game.

1291
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,862
It's tough right now.

1292
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,863
I'm gonna have to make a

1293
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,908
decision before long.

1294
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,966
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1295
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,592
the members of the jury: Sarge,

1296
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:04,555
Chad, Leanne, and Ami-- voted

1297
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,684
out at the last Tribal Council.

1298
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,686
Welcome to Tribal Council.

1299
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,313
Well, let talk about 36 days, a

1300
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,690
lot of wear and tear, physically

1301
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,651
and certainly emotionally.

1302
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,069
Everybody here wants to win the

1303
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:18,819
game.

1304
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,820
Have you guys started thinking

1305
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,239
about who<i> deserves</i> to win this

1306
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,490
game?

1307
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,659
Twila, is there any way that

1308
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,953
somebody could be<i> unworthy</i> of

1309
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,495
winning?

1310
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,164
>> I don't know.

1311
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,040
>> Be honest.

1312
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,333
>> PROBST: You don't know or you

1313
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,126
don't want to say?

1314
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,336
>> You are being hard on

1315
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:35,711
me, you know that?

1316
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,921
>> PROBST: Am I?

1317
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,255
>> Yes, sir, you are.

1318
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,131
>> PROBST: Are you saying there

1319
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,049
are people here tonight that

1320
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,801
absolutely do not deserve to be

1321
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,844
in the final five.

1322
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:46,681
>> Just tell him what you

1323
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,306
feel, Twila.

1324
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,516
>> Yeah, come on.

1325
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,768
>> Why hold back now?

1326
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,354
>> My personal opinion is

1327
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,606
yes, there is.

1328
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,649
>> It's me, by the way,

1329
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,316
in case anybody was wondering.

1330
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,360
>> PROBST: Well, Twila, it's no

1331
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,695
secret you and Eliza have not

1332
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,988
gotten along for a long time.

1333
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,990
>> No. No, there's no secret.

1334
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,074
>> PROBST: Eliza, anybody here

1335
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,200
that doesn't deserve to be here.

1336
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:06,742
>> Even though they would

1337
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,452
say the opposite of me, I think

1338
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,453
all the people sitting here

1339
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,997
deserve to be here.

1340
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,956
That doesn't mean that I like

1341
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,957
them.

1342
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,625
That doesn't mean that I don't

1343
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,460
like other people, who are no

1344
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,254
longer in the game, a million

1345
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,588
times more than I like some of

1346
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,965
the people sitting here next to

1347
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,341
me, but I think we all deserve

1348
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,175
to be here.

1349
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,218
We wouldn't be here otherwise.

1350
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,136
>> PROBST: What about you,

1351
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,137
Julie?

1352
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,762
At this point, when you have to

1353
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,306
vote, obviously, it's strategic,

1354
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,515
but is there any part of you

1355
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,599
starting to whittle things down,

1356
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,350
thinking who I want to go to the

1357
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,853
final four with are these people

1358
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:34,603
and this is why?

1359
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,188
>> Um... I guess, just

1360
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:36,564
judging people.

1361
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,941
The longer you're with them, you

1362
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,776
see their antics and tactics and

1363
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,319
I feel like I can, I know who I

1364
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,696
can trust and who I can't trust

1365
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,197
and who cares about me or who

1366
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,282
doesn't care about me.

1367
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,408
>> PROBST: At this point, do you

1368
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,743
think any of these other four

1369
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,076
care about you?

1370
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,330
>> Yeah, I know that some do.

1371
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,582
>> PROBST: Chris, what's tough

1372
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,750
for you about tonight's vote?

1373
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,375
>> Toughest vote yet.

1374
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,294
>> PROBST: For you?

1375
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,336
>> Oh, yeah.

1376
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,004
>> PROBST: Why?

1377
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,297
>> Uh... kind of caught

1378
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,881
in the middle.

1379
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,632
It's a vote I don't even want to

1380
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,508
cast, but I, you know, I've got

1381
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,094
to play the game.

1382
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,054
>> PROBST: All right.

1383
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,430
Eliza, you have immunity.

1384
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,265
As always, you can keep it or

1385
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,349
assign it to somebody else.

1386
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:12,850
>> I think I better hold

1387
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,185
on to it, Jeff.

1388
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,227
>> Oh, give it to Twila.

1389
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,228
>> It's my first time.

1390
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,521
>> PROBST: Okay, you cannot vote

1391
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,147
for Eliza.

1392
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,731
Everybody else is fair game.

1393
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,649
It is time to vote.

1394
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,735
Scout, you're up.

1395
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,160
>> Jules, a wise woman once

1396
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:31,786
gave me some good information:

1397
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,622
"Go back to your roots, Jules.

1398
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,666
Rediscover your roots."

1399
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,555
>> Twila, I have been

1400
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,599
waiting to vote you off since

1401
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,726
the day I met you.

1402
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,812
I cannot believe that 36 days

1403
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,480
later, I'm finally getting

1404
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,856
this opportunity.

1405
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,333
>> It's tough, but I

1406
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,378
gotta play the game.

1407
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,758
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1408
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,802
votes.

1409
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,313
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

1410
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:41,856
read, the decision is final.

1411
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,690
The person voted out will be

1412
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,691
asked to leave the Tribal

1413
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,525
Council area immediately.

1414
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,279
I'll read the votes.

1415
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:54,702
First vote... Julie.

1416
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,703
Twila.

1417
00:40:55,786 --> 00:41:01,458
One vote Julie, one vote Twila.

1418
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:01,709
Julie.

1419
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:08,048
Two votes Julie, one vote Twila.

1420
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,133
Twila.

1421
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,551
Two votes Twila, two votes

1422
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,552
Julie.

1423
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:16,348
I'll read the last vote.

1424
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,683
The 14th person voted out of

1425
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:21,187
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu...</i>

1426
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,729
Julie.

1427
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,733
You need to bring me your torch.

1428
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,953
Julie, the tribe has spoken.

1429
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,133
Well, you have made it to the

1430
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,426
final four.

1431
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:53,719
Over the next three days, there

1432
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,262
will be three Tribal Councils,

1433
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,097
two immunity challenges, one

1434
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:57,765
winner.

1435
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,017
Grab your torches and head back

1436
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,518
to camp.

1437
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,560
Good night.

1438
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,033
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1439
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,661
from our next episode.

1440
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:20,996
>> PROBST: Next time on

1441
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,705
<i>Survivor:</i>

1442
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,499
>> I don't think you

1443
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,333
deserve to be here, Eliza.

1444
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,668
You have done nothing but boil

1445
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,794
freakin' water.

1446
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,295
>> I think Twila's a dumb bitch.

1447
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:28,796
>> PROBST: The heat is on.

1448
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,090
>> I hope they kill each other.

1449
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,341
>> PROBST: Only three days are

1450
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,342
left.

1451
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,468
Next time, in a two-hour

1452
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:36,011
special, find out who will

1453
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,264
become the sole survivor.

1454
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,348
>> It's for a million bucks.

1455
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,392
That'll change your life.

1456
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,522
>> Here I am.

1457
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,149
It's day 36, I'm done.

1458
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,234
Little bit of a surprise.

1459
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:50,859
You know, I-I thought Chris and

1460
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,861
I had this kind of

1461
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,238
straightforward brother-sister

1462
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,447
kind of slap-each-other-around

1463
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,908
relationship, and Chris<i> was</i> kind

1464
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,285
of my crutch today and he told

1465
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,577
me 100% that he was gonna vote

1466
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:00,869
for Twila.

1467
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,162
I don't know if he changed the

1468
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:02,454
last minute.

1469
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:02,913
I'm curious.
