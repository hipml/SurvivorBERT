Felt.
>> well, okay.

In a game, if you are that

In a game, if you are that
blunt, that honest, it can feel

Blunt, that honest, it can feel
off-putting.

Pearls before swine."
I'm not calling abi a pig, but

397
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,088
I'm not calling abi a pig, but
at some point if someone is not

398

At some point if someone is not
going to value your words, then

Going to value your words, then
you don't keep giving them to

Easier it is to say, "we have to

Easier it is to say, "we have to
get rid of her, right?"

Kind of feel like they need to
start communicating with me

435
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:22,854
Start communicating with me
somehow because they don't know

436
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,923
Somehow because they don't know

Chance than I had before.
Absolutely.

00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,337
Convenient excuse to get rid of
a real threat in this game,

803
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:34,011
A real threat in this game,
which is penner.

804
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,813
Which is penner.
>> so everything's fine.

805
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,681
>> so everything's fine.
We're all writing down penner.

806
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:38,782
We're all writing down penner.
>> there's nothing he can do.

807
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,817
>> you know what, I think I have
surinized it.

808
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:40,818
Surinized it.
I love this game.

809
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,453
I love this game.
I'm just not cut out under this

810
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:42,853
I'm just not cut out under this
game.

811
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,054
Game.
It's too big for me.

812
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,691
It's too big for me.
I'm in such this huge inner

813
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,260
Conflict.
I mean I like denise and

814
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,830
I mean I like denise and
malcolm, but I really-- I really

815
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,131
Malcolm, but I really-- I really
have a heart connection with

816
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,866
Have a heart connection with
carter and penner.

817
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:58,802
Carter and penner.
And now I'm going to hurt

818
00:28:58,804 --> 00:28:59,636
And now I'm going to hurt
somebody I care about.

819
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,405
Somebody I care about.
I mean, it just is so hard.

820
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,372
I mean, it just is so hard.
>> I know.

821
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,540
>> I know.
And I know that's the hardest

822
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,808
And I know that's the hardest
part of this game for you.

823
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,642
Part of this game for you.
>> it is.

824
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:06,744
>> it is.
>> that's okay.

825
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:07,244
>> that's okay.
This is okay.

826
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,146
This is okay.
Because you know what?

827
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:10,013
Because you know what?
Because we made a pact.

828
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:13,817
Because we made a pact.
And we've stuck to it.

829
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:14,518
And we've stuck to it.
It's penner.

830
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,186
It's penner.
>> I love this game, and I want

831
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,387
>> I love this game, and I want
to be a good player.

832
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,257
To be a good player.
I just-- I think perhaps I'm not

833
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,458
I just-- I think perhaps I'm not
cut out for this game.

834
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:30,100
Cut out for this game.
I think it's too big for me.

835
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,668
I think it's too big for me.
I'm not very good at this game.

836
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,504
I'm not very good at this game.
I just don't eye don't want to

837
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:35,739
I just don't eye don't want to
lie to you that I'm totally in.

838
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:36,640
Lie to you that I'm totally in.
>> oh, come on.

839
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:42,246
>> oh, come on.
Cut the crap.

840
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:45,716
Cut the crap.
Really?

841
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:46,617
Really?
Come on.

842
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:52,156
Come on.
Let's go, you and I take a walk.

843
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:58,562
>> no.
>> you want to vote me out?

844
00:29:58,564 --> 00:29:59,163
>> you want to vote me out?
>> no.

845
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,331
>> no.
>> what do you want to do?

846
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,501
>> what do you want to do?
>> as a matter of fact, you

847
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,602
>> as a matter of fact, you
remember before we voted out

848
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,971
Remember before we voted out
peter, I came to you, and said,

849
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,041
Peter, I came to you, and said,
"I want to go to the end with

850
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:11,875
"I want to go to the end with
you and skupin?

851
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:12,643
You and skupin?
>> what's the problem?

852
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,645
>> what's the problem?
>> you said, "I'd like that,

853
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:15,979
>> you said, "I'd like that,
too, but let's see how this

854
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,081
Too, but let's see how this
shakes down, and get peter and

855
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:18,916
Shakes down, and get peter and
abi out of the way.

856
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,317
Abi out of the way.
It's a little too soon to be

857
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,251
It's a little too soon to be
talking that way."

858
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,854
Talking that way."
so you know that's what I

859
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,889
Wanted.
In the meantime, after that,

860
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:31,395
In the meantime, after that,
somebody came to me and said,

861
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:34,464
Somebody came to me and said,
you know, "want to be in an

862
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,566
You know, "want to be in an
alliance to the end?"

863
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:37,868
Alliance to the end?"
>> am I going home tonight?

864
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,304
>> am I going home tonight?
>> not-- I mean, that's the name

865
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:41,572
>> not-- I mean, that's the name
I've been told to write down.

866
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:42,639
I've been told to write down.
>> by who?

867
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:48,278
>> by who?
>> I can't tell you that.

868
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,882
>> I can't tell you that.
I'm so not good at this game.

869
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,383
I'm so not good at this game.
>> this is unbelievable.

870
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,118
>> this is unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.

871
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,019
This is unbelievable.
To me.

872
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,388
To me.
Because I didn't make empty

873
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,291
Promises?
After you had written my name

874
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:01,992
After you had written my name
down twice?

875
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:04,628
Down twice?
And I appreciate that you-- I

876
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,296
Do.
I really appreciate what you're

877
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,131
I really appreciate what you're
going through, but not that it's

878
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,333
Going through, but not that it's
going to knock me out of the

879
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:10,767
Going to knock me out of the
game because I know you don't

880
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:11,235
Game because I know you don't
want to do that.

881
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:11,869
Want to do that.
>> I don't.

882
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:12,870
>> I don't.
>> I know you don't.

883
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,538
>> I know you don't.
>> I really, really-- I really,

884
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,039
>> I really, really-- I really,
really don't want to do that.

885
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,576
Really don't want to do that.
>> lisa once again lost her

886
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,178
Mind.
And she had to confess to me

887
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,413
And she had to confess to me
that she was in another

888
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,215
That she was in another
alliance, that she's voting for

889
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,250
Alliance, that she's voting for
me tonight.

890
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,751
Me tonight.
And I guess to her credit she's

891
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,120
And I guess to her credit she's
going to stick by her guns.

892
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,355
Going to stick by her guns.
She will not be suede.

893
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:37,060
She will not be suede.
I think her guns are ridiculous.

894
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:41,331
I think her guns are ridiculous.
>> I to tell you, and I know you

895
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,200
>> I to tell you, and I know you
believe me, I like you more than

896
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,735
Believe me, I like you more than
anybody out here.

897
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:45,903
Anybody out here.
I want to go to the final three

898
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,604
I want to go to the final three
with you.

899
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:55,412
With you.
It's not about the money.

900
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,249
It's not about the money.
>> well, what are we going to

901
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,550
>> well, what are we going to
do?

902
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,753
Do?
What am I going to do?

903
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:07,391
What am I going to do?
>> I-- I-- I would say go do

904
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:16,033
>> I-- I-- I would say go do
your magic that you do.

905
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:21,438
Your magic that you do.
.>> okay.

906
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,973
.>> okay.
Let the chips fall where they

907
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:23,173
Let the chips fall where they
may.

908
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,308
May.
Here we go.

909
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,609
Here we go.
Lisa got played.

910
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,244
Lisa got played.
And that's-- that is to denise

911
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,578
And that's-- that is to denise
and malcolm's credit.

912
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,614
And malcolm's credit.
Now, my mistake, of course, was

913
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,416
Now, my mistake, of course, was
I was playing both ends against

914
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,850
I was playing both ends against
the middle without making a

915
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:34,618
The middle without making a
commitment to anybody.

916
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,652
Commitment to anybody.
That was probably my mistake.

917
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:44,761
That was probably my mistake.
I did not choose a side.

918
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,830
I did not choose a side.
Well, we're going to vote for

919
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:52,936
Denise.
>> I'm on board.

920
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,705
>> I'm on board.
People are a bit wary of malcolm

921
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,307
People are a bit wary of malcolm
for his idol, and he's aligned

922
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,642
For his idol, and he's aligned
tightly with denise.

923
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,345
Tightly with denise.
So we will now vote for denise.

924
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,180
So we will now vote for denise.
I'm going to check make sure

925
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:03,747
I'm going to check make sure
skupin is cool.

926
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:08,685
Skupin is cool.
>> all right.

927
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,121
>> all right.
>> carter, abi, and I are all

928
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,156
>> carter, abi, and I are all
prepared to vote for denise.

929
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,558
Prepared to vote for denise.
And if you vote for denise,

930
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:14,992
And if you vote for denise,
that's that.

931
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,526
That's that.
I mean, unfortunately for you,

932
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,896
I mean, unfortunately for you,
my brilliant, wise, old chum,

933
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,832
My brilliant, wise, old chum,
you put yourself in the driver's

934
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,967
You put yourself in the driver's
seat and you get to decide who

935
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,202
Seat and you get to decide who
you want to go forward with.

936
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,703
You want to go forward with.
I mean, that's just the way it

937
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,972
Is.
>> that proverbial swing vote.

938
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,540
>> that proverbial swing vote.
>> you are now the swing vote.

939
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,276
>> you are now the swing vote.
>> will lisa change or is she

940
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:34,878
>> will lisa change or is she
locked, based on what your

941
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,245
Locked, based on what your
perception is?

942
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,914
Perception is?
>> honestly, I could lie to you,

943
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,449
>> honestly, I could lie to you,
but I'd never lie to you.

944
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,084
But I'd never lie to you.
I haven't lied to you once.

945
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,686
I haven't lied to you once.
She's right-- right now she's

946
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,588
She's right-- right now she's
conflicted but she does not want

947
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,156
Conflicted but she does not want
to go against her word.

948
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,691
To go against her word.
So she's going to vote for me.

949
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:51,661
So she's going to vote for me.
And it's up to-- it's up to you.

950
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:55,065
And it's up to-- it's up to you.
>> tribal council day is a zoo.

951
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,467
>> tribal council day is a zoo.
My dilemma is I'm going to make

952
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,769
My dilemma is I'm going to make
three people very happy tonight,

953
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,804
Three people very happy tonight,
and I'm going to upset three

954
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,939
People.
I'm going to potentially gain

955
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,841
I'm going to potentially gain
three jury votes and lose three

956
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:05,442
Three jury votes and lose three
jury votes at the same time.

Malcolm shook hands and gave
their words to skupin and lisa,
