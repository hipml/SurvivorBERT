<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,296
>> It's a merge!

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,172
>> Oh, my God!

5
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,382
>> PROBST: The tribes merge.

6
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,133
>> To the merge, hear, hear!

7
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,759
>> PROBST: And they name

8
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,553
themselves "Forza."

9
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,929
The old Jalapao came in with

10
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:13,555
only four members to Timbira's

11
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,806
six.

12
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:15,598
>> We're in control, baby.

13
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,933
>> PROBST: And J.T. became the

14
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:21,187
target.

15
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,022
>> Right now, J.T. needs to go.

16
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:23,940
>> PROBST: But some former

17
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:24,941
Timbira members made new

18
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,776
friends.

19
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,613
And new plans.

20
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,951
>> In my alliance now, Stephen

21
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,453
and J.T. have replaced Brendan

22
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,662
and Sierra.

23
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,455
>> PROBST: Feeling safe, Brendan

24
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,040
ignored his Exile alliance...

25
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,544
leaving Taj open to new ideas.

26
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,383
But everyone's plans were cut

27
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,595
short when Joe was evacuated.

28
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,138
Joe's been battling a pretty

29
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:55,555
decent infection.

30
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,139
Medical did a thorough

31
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,516
assessment.

32
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,726
He can't continue.

33
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:00,310
>> What?!

34
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,853
>> PROBST: So, no Tribal

35
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,146
Council.

36
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,646
>> Brendan lives to see

37
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,231
another day.

38
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,357
Now, I don't know what's going

39
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,150
to happen.

40
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,234
>> PROBST: Nine are left.

41
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,613
Who will be voted out tonight?

42
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,805
>> That sucks.

43
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,973
Joe left camp today, and it was

44
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,433
just kind of this funk that was

45
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,768
permeating the camp.

46
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,811
And we're sitting around there,

47
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,770
looking at the fire.

48
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,939
Nobody was saying anything.

49
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,902
And I just wanted to share a

50
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,737
piece of my life with them.

51
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,780
I wanted to show them that no

52
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,156
matter how bad it gets in your

53
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,035
life, there's always something

54
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,245
that's going to make it much

55
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,039
worse.

56
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,336
>> I want to hear this story.

57
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,296
>> So, I shared with the tribe

58
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,339
one of the stories about the

59
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,966
time that I got caught in the

60
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,300
Amazon and thought I was going

61
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,719
to get killed.

62
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,415
Now, they were probably, you

63
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,916
know, four, four and a half

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,043
feet tall.

65
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,083
I paddled so hard that my hands

66
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,419
started bleeding.

67
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,678
>> You don't want to say,

68
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,806
"Coach, hey, let's have a

69
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,349
reality check here.

70
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,851
But no one said a word.

71
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,477
It was silent when he finished

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,479
and everybody was kind of going

73
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,647
around looking at each other,

74
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,859
like, "Whoa!"

75
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,485
>> How much does it cost to get

76
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,278
a military copter to drop you

77
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,446
in?

78
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,447
>> That would be free.

79
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,407
>> How?

80
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,370
>> Honestly, like, you know,

81
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,206
Coach is either the new coming

82
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,583
of Jacques Cousteau, or he's,

83
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,168
you know, basically the biggest

84
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,294
fraud that is in this game.

85
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:13,795
>> They were just, like,

86
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,379
ecstatic that I wanted to come

87
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,547
down there.

88
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,513
>> I don't believe this guy

89
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,514
anymore.

90
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,474
And if I don't believe his

91
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,100
stories, how I can believe what

92
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,395
he's saying to my face?

>> Yeah, it's called chong ran.

122
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,609
And it's, uh, ancient Tibetan.

00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,443
If you do a Google search on

It's only passed down verbally.

126
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,781
You have to go there to the

127

128
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,617

132
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,588
I have the power alliance,

133
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,924
commanding my officers, running

134
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,552
the show, like I was born to do.

135
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,512
You know, if you look at it, to

136
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,721
defeat an army, you have to cut

137
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,639
off the head of the dragon,

138
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,598
which is why I nicknamed

139
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,267
Brendan "the dragon."

140
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,351
Hence, my name, the

141
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:16,853
"Dragonslayer."

142
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,645
Where does Sierra fit into all

143
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,312
this?

144
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:18,938
With the comments that she made

145
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,441
today, Sierra is the bowel

146
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,609
movements that come out of the

147
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,736
dragon.

148
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,362
After Brendan, Sierra's got to

149
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,573
go.

150
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,876
>> Worried about Joe?

151
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,002
>> Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he's

152
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:41,294
doing fine.

153
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,712
I hate having him leave the

154
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,379
game.

155
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,088
>> I know.

156
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,423
Well, you guys were such good

157
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:45,756
friends, too.

158
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,549
>> I know.

159
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,217
>> Like, I was so happy to have

160
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,093
met him.

161
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,386
It was so nice to know that

162
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,429
like, Joe was going to be here,

163
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,805
and I was going to have, you

164
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,973
know, somebody that I knew I

165
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,725
could go to with stuff.

166
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,435
And then for that to not happen,

167
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,728
I was so bummed.

168
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,937
And I just like him, you know,

169
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,230
like, he's a cool guy.

170
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:01,856
>> He's a cool guy.

171
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,316
He's a real cool guy.

172
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,275
Stephen as well.

173
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,276
Stephen's an awesome guy.

174
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:05,860
>> Yeah, I really like him.

175
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,862
Well, I like all you guys.

176
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,571
I'm like, "How do I like your

177
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,574
tribe more than I like my own?"

178
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,658
>> Are you aligned with anyone

179
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,493
here now?

180
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,704
>> Um, aligned, not so much.

181
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,830
I've kind of stayed pretty

182
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,041
neutral, but, you know,

183
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,417
regardless of who I'm talking

184
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,418
to or whatever, the only

185
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,586
alliance I had in this game was

186
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,297
Joe, so...

187
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,423
When you break it down, you've

188
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,633
got my original tribe, where we

189
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,760
knew I was the first one out.

190
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,679
Then I have these new kids who

191
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,098
are down in numbers and really

192
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,516
need a fourth.

193
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,018
But no matter how the dice

194
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,354
rolls, I've got some room to

195
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,063
play around.

196
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,065
It's really nice.

197
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:44,732
>> Things are in our favor

198
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:44,982
right now.

199
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,691
>> Yeah, because like I said,

200
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,069
I like you guys more than I like

201
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,695
my own tribe.

202
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,198
>> Erinn's vote would be huge,

203
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:52,782
you know, because I lost Joe.

204
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,117
He was a huge, solid vote.

205
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,787
But now, Taj, myself, Stephen,

206
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,373
and Erinn could easily turn the

207
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,415
game around.

208
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,750
So, it's good to know if I need

209
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,418
her, I can call on her.

210
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:04,961
I know things are different

211
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,213
from the time I got here.

212
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,382
>> Yeah.

213
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:26,148
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

214
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,149
You guys ready to get to today's

215
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:27,775
challenge?

216
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,109
>> Absolutely.

217
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,277
>> Yeah.

218
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,152
>> PROBST: For today's

219
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,320
challenge, you will be divided

220
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,780
into teams of three.

221
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,824
Each team will have one row of

222
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,701
eight color-coded ceramic tiles.

223
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,328
On my go, one member from each

224
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,621
team will toss a metal ball,

225
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,748
attempting to knock out one of

226
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,417
the tiles of the other two

227
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,543
teams.

228
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,210
When you're out of tiles,

229
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,670
you're out of the challenge.

230
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,131
Last team left standing wins

231
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,549
reward.

232
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,341
Want to know what you're playing

233
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:52,967
for?

234
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,676
>> Oh, yeah.

235
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,427
>> Yes.

236
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,177
>> PROBST: The winning threesome

237
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,679
will be taken on an afternoon

238
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,307
of whitewater river rafting down

239
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,725
the Rio Novo.

240
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,642
>> Yes!

241
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,810
>> PROBST: This is world-class

242
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,313
river rafting, an experience

243
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,315
you will not soon forget.

244
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,607
After the rafting trip, you

245
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,401
will have a nice picnic,

246
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,361
sandwiches, chicken wings,

247
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,654
brownies.

248
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,156
>> Brownies!

249
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:15,823
>> Oh, my God!

250
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,575
>> PROBST: In addition, the

251
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,160
winning threesome will choose

252
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,786
one member of either of the two

253
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,787
losing teams to go to Exile

254
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,207
Island alone.

255
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:25,666
A lot at stake.

256
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,918
You guys ready to get to it?

257
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:28,169
>> Yep.

258
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:28,794
>> PROBST: We'll draw for teams

259
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,840
and we'll get started.

260
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,176
All right, we have our teams:

261
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,470
Debbie, Brendan, J.T.

262
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,679
Tyson, Taj, Coach.

263
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,723
Stephen, Sierra, and Erinn.

264
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,516
Here we go.

265
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,893
First shooters, head up.

266
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,437
Your goal is to break the tile

267
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,063
of one of the other teams, not

268
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,565
your own.

269
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:49,857
>> Stephen!

270
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,359
Stephen, man, what are you

271
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,443
doing?!

272
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,611
>> PROBST: Stephen and Coach

273
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,695
going for black.

274
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,530
Debbie going for red.

275
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,741
Here we go: three, two, one.

276
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,326
Toss.

277
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:00,910
Debbie knocks out a red tile.

278
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,869
>> Yes!

279
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,579
>> PROBST: Stephen and Coach

280
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,830
both knock out a black tile.

281
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,165
Black team loses two tiles in

282
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,333
that round.

283
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,709
>> Come on. Let's go.

284
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,002
>> Easy, Coach.

285
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,047
>> Next group.

286
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,757
Sierra's going to go red; Tyson

287
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,800
going after black.

288
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,593
>> Why is everybody after the

289
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,552
black team?

290
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,220
>> Your team is a little

291
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,763
stacked, I think.

292
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,347
>> We're throwing underhand

293
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,847
breaking tiles.

294
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,557
None of us have ever done this

295
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:23,891
in our lives.

296
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,686
>> I have.

297
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,479
>> Coach likes to have the

298
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,188
attention.

299
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,106
I mean, all the great stuff

300
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,524
he's done.

301
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,441
Sounds almost too good to be

302
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,401
true.

303
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:33,859
>> PROBST: Here we go.

304
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,071
Three, two, one, toss.

305
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:37,863
Brendan breaks a white tile.

306
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,949
Sierra takes out a red tile

307
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,660
Tyson gets nothing.

308
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,160
Black is down two tiles.

309
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,995
Red is down two tiles.

310
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:45,913
White is down one tile.

311
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,872
The more tiles you have, the

312
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,999
better off you are.

313
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,677
Brendan breaks a white tile.

314
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,136
J.T. with a long toss.

315
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:00,761
Sierra's on fire!

316
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,930
Connects, knocking out a

317
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,222
white tile.

318
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,141
Tyson wipes out a white tile.

319
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,183
>> Yeah!

320
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,519
My first one today!

321
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,145
>> PROBST: With that round, red

322
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,064
is now down to one tile left.

323
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,232
Black team, white team, each

324
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,483
have two tiles left.

325
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,194
We are getting down to it.

326
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,821
Debbie going for white; Stephen

327
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,615
and Coach going for black.

328
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,493
Three, two, one, toss.

329
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:24,994
Debbie tosses and misses.

330
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,745
Stephen misses.

331
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,997
Coach annihilates a black

332
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,791
tile.

333
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,959
Black team now down with one

334
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,085
tile left.

335
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,753
The red team has one tile left,

336
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,754
and the white team has two

337
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,131
tiles left.

338
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,799
>> Finish the red off.

339
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,675
And I'll miss, Erinn.

340
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,593
>> Okay.

341
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,386
>> Oh, oh, you want to send her

342
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,636
to red?!

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,762
Oh, okay.

344
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,722
>> All right, well, I'll get

345
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,348
right (indistinct)

346
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,141
>> Taj, come over there with

347
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:47,850
white.

348
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,852
Go back to white with J.T.

349
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,145
>> PROBST: Erinn is trying to

350
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,730
take out the last tile for the

351
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,647
red team.

352
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,273
>> Erinn, I'm going to whip

353
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,024
your tail.

354
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,108
>> PROBST: J.T. and Taj

attempting to take out the

356
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,527
last two tiles for the

357
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,195
white team.

358
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,030
Three, two, one, toss.

359
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,993
Erinn knocks out the last

360
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,119
remaining red tile.

361
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,370
The red team is now out of this

362
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,122
challenge.

363
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,040
Sierra could put the black team

364
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,501
out of this and win it for the

365
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,670
white team with one toss.

366
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,507
Three, two, one, toss.

367
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,174
>> Oh!

368
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,592
>> PROBST: Sierra short.

369
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
Brendan takes out another white

370
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,345

have one tile left.

373
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,767
This could do it.

374
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,060
Erinn for the white team,

375
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,019

Three, two, one.

377

Toss.

378
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,857
Erinn goes deep, just too far.

379
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,902
J.T. just too short.

380
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,861
>> Oh, I thought that was it,

381
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,280
man.

382
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,281
Deb, come on.

383
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:44,990
>> PROBST: Debbie and Stephen,

384
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,992
each looking to take out the

385
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,787
last tile of the other team.

386
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,414
Three, two, one, toss.

387
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:52,998
Debbie, no chance.

388
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,084
Stephen, no chance.

389
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,962
Sierra and Brendan.

390
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,004
Brendan looking to win it for

391
00:13:59,088 --> 00:13:59,380
the black team.

392
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,048
Three, two, one.

393
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,925
Toss.

394
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,634
Oh!

395
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,677
>> PROBST: Sierra short.

396
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,219
Brendan clips it, but not

397
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,929
enough.

398
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,764
That white tile is clipped,

399
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,516
but it is still standing.

400
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,225
>> Oh, man!

401
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,352
>> PROBST: It still counts.

402
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,311
J.T. going to try to put the

403
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,563
finishing touches on that white

404
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,647
tile.

405
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,565
Erinn would like to win it for

406
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:17,940
the white team.

407
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:22,695
Three, two, one, toss.

408
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,571
>> PROBST: Erinn with a good

409
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:23,946
toss.

410
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,699
>> Nope, it's not down.

411
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,575
>> PROBST: Erinn knocks the

412
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,035
black tile, but it doesn't fall.

413
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,412
It cannot get any closer than

414
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:31,620
this.

415
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,664
Both tiles have been broken.

416
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,456
Neither one of them has fallen

417
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,666
through.

418
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,667
Stephen, you may not even have

419
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,459
to hit that tile.

420
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,836
You might just hit the wood.

421
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,004
The vibration may knock it in.

422
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,797
>> Stephen, don't do nothing

423
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,591
crazy now.

424
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,133
>> PROBST: Three, two, one,

425
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,718
toss.

426
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,343
>> Oh, no!

427
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,052
>> PROBST: Debbie too far,

428
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,929
Stephen too short.

429
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,307
Big reward on the line:

430
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,891
whitewater river rafting, nice

431
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,976
picnic, brownies, chicken

432
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,478
wings, sandwiches.

433
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,022
>> Oh, my God, this is a

434
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,981
nailbiter.

435
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,691
>> PROBST: Here we go.

436
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,110
Three, two, one, toss.

437
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,864
Sierra short.

438
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,448
Brendan knocks out the final

439
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,450
white tile.

440
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,785
Black team wins reward.

441
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,208
Black team, come on over.

442
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,837
J.T., Debbie, Brendan, nice job.

443
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,880
Before we send you on a nice

444
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,505
reward, you have a big decision

445
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,173
to make.

446
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,841
Figure out which person you are

447
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:26,342
sending to Exile Island.

448
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,469
They are going alone.

449
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,011
They will not be choosing

450
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,056
anybody to go with them.

451
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,432
>> Stephen.

452
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,308
>> PROBST: Stephen, grab your

453
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:34,516
stuff.

454
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,310
>> Be the wizard, Stephen.

455
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,730
Be the wizard.

456
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,856
>> PROBST: A map, even though

457
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:41,899
you've been there before.

458
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,524
Head back out the way you came.

459
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,692
>> Sorry, Stephen.

460
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,485
>> Thanks, Jeff.

461
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,569
No, it's my pleasure.

462
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,737
>> PROBST: Stephen will return

463
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,988
in time for the next immunity

464
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:48,238
challenge.

465
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,783
All right, J.T., Brendan,

466
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,118
Debbie, nice reward.

467
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,828
Whitewater river rafting,

468
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,287
nice afternoon picnic.

469
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,038
It will be a nice little break.

470
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,873
You will head back to camp and

471
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,083
go on your reward tomorrow.

472
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,376
Got it.

473
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,502
>> PROBST: All right, guys,

474
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,628
sadly, I got nothing for you.

475
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,462
Grab your stuff and head back

476
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,505
to camp.

477
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,339
>> Thanks, Jeff.

478
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,173
>> PROBST: Coach, you can, uh,

479
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:06,548
leave that behind.

480
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,049
>> I'm sorry.

481
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,801
I'm so pissed off right now.

482
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,177
>> I'm sorry.

483
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,261
>> I wanted to get on that river

484
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,722
in some type of raft or kayak

485
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,975
since I got here.

486
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,143
>> I mean, I expect Brendan

487
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,396
trying to scheme.

488
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,230
I'm not really that worried,

489
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,147
Brendan being gone with J.T.

490
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:22,731
and Debbie.

491
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,524
Those are two of the strongest

492
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,317
allies.

493
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,694
So, it actually worked out well.

494
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,569
I just hope the extra food

495
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,821
Brendan gets isn't going to

496
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,905
hurt our chances for winning

497
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:40,958
immunity.

498
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,459
>> Clue six: "A big wooden head

499
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,211
is what you have here.

500
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,462
Look in the gap that you'll

501
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,589
find in the rear."

502
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,090
No surprise here.

503
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,800
Great.

504
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,051
This is my first Exile out here

505
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:51,969
alone.

506
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,011
It's the first of anybody's

507
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,346
Exiles out here alone, and I got

508
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,931
the new clue to the same idols

509
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,391
that we know about.

510
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,475
So, I know there's no new idol

511
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,602
in the game.

512
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,152
I'm definitely concerned about

513
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,236
being on Exile.

514
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,447
I haven't made fire yet at camp.

515
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,573
I tried a few times and I

516
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,866
failed, and I was so

517
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,908
embarrassed I hadn't tried

518
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,868
again.

519
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,202
So, I knew that by forcing

520
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,246
myself to come out here, either

521
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,206
I would make fire, make food,

522
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,333
or I would die.

523
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,885
It looked like I might die.

524
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,219
I was trying for about an hour

525
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,431
or two to make fire, just

526
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,016
smacking that flint over and

527
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,851
over again with a machete.

528
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,020
And nothing.

529
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,693
How about that!

530
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,653
Damn, I can build a fire!

531
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,112
How about that!

532
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,448
Finally, as darkness was

533
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,116
starting to close around me,

534
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,202
I got a spark; it caught; and

535
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,120
the whole thing took.

536
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,205
It was like giving birth to my

537
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,664
first child.

538
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,665
I felt so proud of that little

539
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,958
fire that I just wanted to stay

540
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,960
out here and tend to it for the

541
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,629
rest of my life.

542
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,546
So, even though I missed out on

543
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,590
that good lunch and a fun,

544
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,550
relaxing, water rafting trip,

545
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,135
being out here and making it

546
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,846
is like winning my own reward.

547
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,413
>> Brendan, myself, and Debbie

548
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,206
went to the reward, and we had

549
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,208
a blast.

550
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,125
I've actually never been able

551
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,585
to go whitewater rafting and

552
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,628
that's something I've always

553
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,547
wanted to do forever.

554
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,717
I felt just like a little kid.

555
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,260
>> A-ha!

556
00:18:56,343 --> 00:19:01,014
>> Yeah!

557
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,268
>> Great job!

558
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,770
>> The reward was so much fun.

559
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,689
The pure joy that was on J.T.'s

560
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,524
face to see how much he just

561
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,609
soaks it up and appreciates it.

562
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,569
What a great soul.

563
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,320
So sincere, so real.

564
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,156
Like, all qualities that you

565
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,740
want in people that surround

566
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,242
you or at least I do.

567
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,911
>> Forza!

568
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,083
>> After we did, like, the best

569
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,209
rafting ever, we came along

570
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,503
this huge sandbar and I knew it

571
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,297
was our picnic.

572
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,798
>> This is amazing!

573
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,258
I've died and gone to heaven.

574
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,092
Chips!

575
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,510
There's chips!

576
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,553
Oh, my God!

577
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,097
Look at those brownies!

578
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,431
Whoo!

579
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,308
Oh, my God.

580
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,476
This is the best food in the

581
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,395
world.

582
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,440
>> Oh, my God!

583
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,316
I had a really good day.

584
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,026
I mean, it was a lot better

585
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:54,985
than I had pictured.

586
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,653
I figured Brendan and I being

587
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,738
together would kind of be a

588
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,198
dull trip, but there wasn't a

589
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,366
dull moment at all.

590
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,460
>> No?

591
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,377
>> About what?

592
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,378
>> Just about how to, you know.

593
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,379
>> Keep me in the game a little

594
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,339
longer.

595
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:15,756
>> Have some fun.

596
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,174
>> If there's an opportunity,

597
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:17,799
I damn sure will do what I can

598
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,968
do, whatever I can.

599
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,385
>> All right, yeah.

600
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,303
I always kind of define winning

601
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,722
in a lot of my life of saying

602
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,348
like, I'm going to be #1.

603
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,390
If I take J.T. in the finals

604
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,018
with me, he's going to beat me.

605
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,020
I know it's crazy, but for me,

606
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,605
winning in this game is about

607
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,898
getting to an outcome at the

608
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,358
end of the game which is going

609
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,693
to satisfy me.

610
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,487
If he wins it, that's like me

611
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,905
winning this game.

612
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,698
How do I get him to the finals?

613
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,741
I don't know.

614
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,825
That's the next step I need to

615
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,743
wrap my head around.

616
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,619
Let's have some fun.

617
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,703
>> I'm definitely up for it,

618
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,331
man.

619
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,429
>> I stayed up all night.

620
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,764
I sat in that shelter and did

621
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,641
not sleep at all, just running

622
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,183
through all the different

623
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,601
scenarios about how do I get

624
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,144
J.T. to the finals.

625
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,854
And at a certain point, all the

626
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,480
pieces, like, just fell and you

627
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,774
could see the puzzle and how it

628
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,859
needs to be put together.

629
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,948
>> Here's how we're gonna do

630
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:23,490
it.

631
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,408
Um, I don't think we should send

632
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,744
J.T. home.

633
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,249
We had the awesome time.

634
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,750
He's such a good dude.

635
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,543
Debbie had such a good time

636
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,836
with him.

637
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,086
>> He is.

638
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,379
He's one of the most amazing

639
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,213
people I have ever met in my

640
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,131
life.

641
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,298
>> I think what we should do is

642
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,011
you, me, Taj, Stephen, J.T.,

643
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,723
take out Tyson, Coach, and

644
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,391
Erinn.

645
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,643
Start taking them out.

646
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,352
>> This morning, Brendan is

647
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:52,978
like, "All right, here's what's

648
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,395
going on.

649
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,479
I really like J.T.

650
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,398
I think J.T. deserves to be

651
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,816
here," and I feel the same way.

652
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:58,859
Like, I really respect J.T.

653
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,193
So, we're going to try to get

654
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,611
Coach and Tyson.

655
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,869
>> Okay, so, I know how to do

656
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,996
it.

657
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,001
>> Change it?

658
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:16,585
How?

659
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,963
>> You, me, Stephen, J.T.,

660
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:20,881
and Sierra...

661
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,507
>> Okay.

662
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,304
Okay, okay.

663
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:27,888
>> And, Taj?

664
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:28,388
>> Yes?

665
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,639
>> We haven't talked...

666
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,849
>> I know, we haven't had a

667
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,558
chance to.

668
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,434
>> That's got to make you

669
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,854
uncomfortable, but you, like,

670
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,521
you gotta trust me.

671
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,690
>> I can't describe Timbira.

672
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,483
I really want to know what that

673
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,776
word stands for because it

674
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,568
could mean "confused."

675
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,611
Coach and Tyson want to

676
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,406
blindside Brendan, and, um,

677
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,699
Brendan is trying it vote out

678
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,284
Tyson or Coach.

679
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:49,868
We haven't even had to really

680
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,245
put any plans into action yet

681
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,163
because they're so busy trying

682
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,247
to get out their own tribe

683
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:54,790
members right now.

684
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,041
We're like, "Okay, do what you

685
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,167
gotta do and we'll come in

686
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,501
later."

687
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,418
>> Sierra knows the plan.

688
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,088
Yesterday, on the river trip,

689
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,006
I talked to J.T. and I was like

690
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,008
"J.T., I think I can save you."

691
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,885
He's such a good dude.

692
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:07,969
>> I know, he is.

693
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,221
I love him to death, and I

694
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,180
don't want him to go.

695
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,349
>> No, I agree. I agree.

696
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:25,237
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

697
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,363
We'll now bring in Stephen,

698
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,698
returning from Exile Island.

699
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,580
>> Welcome back, buddy.

700
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,582
>> PROBST: You were out there

701
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,251
for a while on Exile this time.

702
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:39,835
>> It was a couple of days

703
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,336
alone, yeah, but actually, not

704
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,129
that bad.

705
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,088
The weather was pretty good.

706
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,006
I had big fires both nights.

707
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,632
I didn't get much sleep, but it

708
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,009
was, you know, it was all right.

709
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,010
>> PROBST: You guys ready to

710
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:49,928
get to today's challenge?

711
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,512
>> Let's do it.

712
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,429
>> PROBST: First things first.

713
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,181
Tyson, hand back the necklace.

714
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:57,102
>> It's too gaudy for me anyway.

715
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,228
>> PROBST: Does that mean you

716
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:58,979
don't want it again?

717
00:23:59,062 --> 00:23:59,771
>> Oh, I'll probably wear it

718
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,314
again.

719
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,232
>> PROBST: All right.

720
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:02,858
For today's challenge, you will

721
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,610
each be attached to a long rope

722
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,695
that is threaded through a

723
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,321
series of obstacles.

724
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,531
You'll climb over, crawl under,

725
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,159
maneuver around these obstacles

726
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,618
as you race to the finish.

727
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,537
First three to finish move on

728
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,080
to the final round, where, once

729
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,540
again, you will be attached to

730
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,834
one long rope, only this time,

731
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,460
the obstacle is three levels

732
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:22,669
high.

733
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,462
It will seriously complicate

734
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:24,713
things.

735
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,507
First person to finish wins

736
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,633
immunity, guaranteed a

737
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,719
one-in-eight shot

738
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,305
at winning this game.

739
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,307
Losers, Tribal Council, where

740
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:35,891
somebody will be going home.

741
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,559
We'll draw for spots and get

742
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,727
started.

743
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:42,564
Here we go.

744
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,233
For immunity, survivors ready?

745
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,694
Go!

746
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,570
There is a learning curve to

747
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,615
this challenge.

748
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,491
Things that will help make

749
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,034
getting around this rope a

750
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,619
little easier, but there are no

751
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,704
shortcuts.

752
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,960
J.T. off to a quick start.

753
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:08,256
Tyson off to a quick start.

754
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,052
Debbie, J.T., Tyson, all doing

755
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,511
very well.

756
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,679
Coach flying through the course.

757
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,099
Brendan right in there.

758
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,477
Sierra hanging in there.

759
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,730
Taj struggling, in dead last.

760
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,317
Stephen not doing a lot better.

761
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,902
Erinn right in there.

762
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,278
It's Tyson and J.T. battling

763
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,406
it out right now.

764
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,699
Sierra's now through.

765
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:39,204
It's Tyson, J.T., and Sierra.

766
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,706
Brendan's through.

767
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,459
Coach frustrated, stuck.

768
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,001
Nothing prepared him for the

769
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,380
rope-a-dope.

770
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,424
Tyson and J.T., neck and neck.

771
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,050
Erinn now moving on to the next

772
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,802
obstacle.

773
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,178
Tyson has finished the second

774
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:55,929
obstacle.

775
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:56,638
Tyson now on the last obstacle,

776
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,808
J.T. right behind him.

777
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,310
Tyson and J.T. in very good

778
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,436
shape.

779
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,729
Three people are moving on to

780
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,897
the final.

781
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,774
The other six will have no shot

782
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,608
at immunity.

783
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,361
J.T. throwing himself over this

784
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,655
challenge.

785
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,906
Brendan now on to the last

786
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,658
obstacle.

787
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,911
It is Tyson, J.T., and Brendan.

788
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,122
Sierra now is in it.

789
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:22,747
Four people fighting for three

790
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,083
spots.

791
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:25,709
Taj and Stephen still back on

792
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,878
the first obstacle.

793
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,130
J.T. very close.

794
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,381
Tyson very close.

795
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,340
It's going to come down to

796
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,508
Brendan and Sierra for that

797
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,884
final spot.

798
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,094
Brendan with a bit of a lead

799
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,387
over Sierra.

800
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,765
J.T. is across first.

801
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,976
J.T. moving on to the final.

802
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:43,810
Tyson is across.

803
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,854
Tyson moving on to the final.

804
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,440
Brendan and Sierra battling for

805
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,608
one final spot.

806
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,823
Brendan losing his shoes.

807
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,873
Brendan moves on to the final!

808
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,959
Tyson, J.T., and Brendan, moving

809
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,087
on to the final.

810
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:11,713
Here we go, for immunity.

811
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,841
Tyson, J.T., Brendan.

812
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,759
Survivors ready?

813
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,261
Go!

814
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,638
First round was very close.

815
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,849
Only one will win immunity.

816
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:28,521
A lot of bodies being launched.

817
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,939
Tyson off to an early lead.

818
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,901
J.T. is right behind him.

819
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,152
Cannot fall behind in this

820
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,321
challenge.

821
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,334
Tyson and J.T. very close.

822
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:54,631
Brendan right in there.

823
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,510
Brendan now in the lead.

824
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,720
>> Keep going, J.T.!

825
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,805
>> PROBST: Brendan still with a

826
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,349
lead over J.T. and Tyson.

827
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,315
Tyson making up some ground now.

828
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:12,857
Getting down to it.

829
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,192
It is Brendan and Tyson.

830
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,736
J.T. has fallen out of it.

831
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,370
On the last part of this course,

832
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,955
Tyson now with the lead.

833
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:27,747
>> Tyson!

834
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,373
>> PROBST: Tyson flying through

835
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,874
this.

836
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,835
Tyson wins immunity!

837
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,715
>> Oh, my God!

838
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,883
>> Tyson saved the day ensuring

839
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,093
that Brendan would go home

840
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,010
tonight.

841
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,636
In case he plays the immunity

842
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,178
idol, we're gonna split the

843
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,763
votes, four for Brendan,

844
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,098
three for Sierra.

845
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,141
Brendan is the dragon.

846
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,016
I'm the dragonslayer.

847
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,767
This is gonna be the biggest

848
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,478
power move to date of this game,

849
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,563
no question about it.

850
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,982
>> PROBST: Tyson, come on over.

851
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,941
>> Tyson!

852
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,818
>> PROBST: As he predicted, for

853
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,780
the second time, Tyson has

854
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,906
immunity once again.

855
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,576
Tyson's safe at Tribal Council.

856
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,326
Not the same for the rest of

857
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,369
you.

858
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,495
One of you going home tonight.

859
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:07,996
Grab your stuff.

860
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,705
Head back to camp.

861
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,165
I will see you at Tribal.

862
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,082
>> Tyson won the immunity.

863
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,167
We can't vote Tyson.

864
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,334
So, I decided on Coach.

865
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,044
It will be nice to have him out

866
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:35,190
of here, I think.

867
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,149
>> Congratulations.

868
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,150
>> Thanks, dude.

869
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:37,817
You were awesome.

870
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,319
>> Seriously, it was a delight

871
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,111
watching you.

872
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:40,945
It was like something out of...

873
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,490
>> Dude, you need a hug, man.

874
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,492
>> You need a hug.

875
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,075
>> You got your fire started.

876
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,994
>> I got my fire started.

877
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,120
>> Oh, you were so worried.

878
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:49,913
>> Unfortunately I spent like an

879
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,623
hour just chopping at that flint

880
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,791
and I made it and it was like,

881
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,584
it was actually one of the best

882
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,543
moments of my life.

883
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,002
>> Oh!

884
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,296
>> For me, it was a big step.

885
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,799
>> I'm very proud of you.

886
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,675
>> We missed your poetry

887
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,469
yesterday.

888
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,094
I feel like I have no skills at

889
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,346
all.

890
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,515
>> You know what I did?

891
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,857
>> I started this plan to

892
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,026
eliminate Brendan days ago,

893
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,903
but due to default, we didn't

894
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,238
even go to Tribal.

895
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,447
I've already got it set up so

896
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,156
four votes go to Brendan,

897
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,950
three votes go to Sierra.

898
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,535
If Brendan gets wind of it and

899
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,787
uses his idol, Sierra is gone.

900
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,038
Brendan's gone in three days

901
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:32,288
from that.

902
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,332
I'd like to see him go first

903
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,291
because I'd like three days of

904
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,417
just bossing her around and

905
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,001
telling her to shut up.

906
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,962
Probably won't win me her vote

907
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,549
from the jury, but it would

908
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,675
probably win me everybody else's

909
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,636
vote, so... so it would be a

910
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,556
win-win for me.

911
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,269
>> What is it?

912
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,562
>> Water.

913
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,521
>> All right, can we just sit

914
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,146
down real quick?

915
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,147
>> Yeah.

916
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,315
>> The Exile alliance

917
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,442
hibernated for a while.

918
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,485
Uh, it's finally going to rear

919
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,736
its ugly head.

920
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,863
>> I talked to Taj this morning.

921
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,782
I think we go after Coach.

922
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:12,078
We get us four and Taj, I had

923
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,955
an extensive conversation with

924
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,331
Taj this morning about it.

925
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,042
>> Okay.

926
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:18,876
>> You guys cool?

927
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,335
>> Yeah.

928
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,044
>> Oh, yeah.

929
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,671
>> Okay.

930
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,549
>> Myself, Sierra, Taj, Stephen,

931
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,050
and now J.T. are all voting

932
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,093
Coach.

933
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,137
I think that this will be one

934
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,722
of the biggest blindsides

935
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,139
so far in the game.

936
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,142
Um, so, I guess I'm happy to be

937
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,812
a part of on the good side.

938
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,158
>> I thought you might.

939
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,702
Wow, that changes everything.

940
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,620
>> He said he wants me in the

941
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,495
finals.

942
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,665
>> Why would he want that?

943
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,124
>> He likes me a lot.

944
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,917
>> But that's crazy.

945
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,085
>> I know.

946
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,503
>> It would be a really strong

947
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:02,920
play.

948
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:03,463
We might have to seriously

949
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,214
think about it.

950
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,637
>> You know what, he's crazy.

951
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,095
He is somewhat crazy.

952
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,806
I think that story about him

953
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,433
being captured on the Amazon,

954
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,476
that's just hard to believe.

955
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,268
>> That is pretty hard to

956
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,561
believe.

957
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,398
>> I mean, (indistinct) I mean,

958
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,733
I wouldn't reckon with them son

959
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,027
of a bitches, don't you think?

960
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,363
I would have come back with a

961
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,281
damn .30-.30 Winchester.

962
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,910
Something, you know what I mean?

963
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,041
>> I would definitely say we're

964
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,626
in control of this game now.

965
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,293
>> It's a big difference, you

966
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,211
know?

967
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,879
Jalapao came into the merge

968
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,089
down in numbers, but before the

969
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,174
first Tribal Council we come to,

970
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,801
I'm the deciding factor.

971
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,885
It's huge.

972
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:51,928
I can go with Brendan right now

973
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:52,553
and get rid of Coach or I can

974
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,138
go with Coach and Tyson and get

975
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,348
rid of Brendan.

976
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,475
It's completely in my court.

977
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,480
>> Clean pots and water.

978
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,314
>> Clean pots and water?

979
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,691
>> Yeah.

980
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,358
>> I'm looking forward to

981
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,192
Tribal.

982
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,151
The old Timbira is going to go

983
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,236
after J.T., but I'm going to

984
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,363
take out Coach.

985
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,155
>> Sierra's got that pot...

986
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,449
>> She does?

987
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,117
>> I don't like misleading

988
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,452
people, but I feel like this is

989
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,203
the one time in life that you're

990
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,246
actually allowed to do it and

991
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,247
you get a get-out-of-jail-free

992
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,332
pass.

993
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,130
>> I'm down with that.

994
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:27,922
>> Okay.

995
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,215
>> Tyson.

996
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,678
>> J.T.?

997
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,179
>> Yeah.

998
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,392
>> Just pass it around.

999
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,643
>> Okay.

1000
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,352
>> Pass it around, make sure

1001
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,270
everybody knows.

1002
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,312
Everybody already pretty much

1003
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,313
knows.

1004
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,314
>> Sierra, you good?

1005
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,315
>> Yeah.

1006
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,067
Done.

1007
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,945
>> Done and done?

1008
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:51,154
Okay.

1009
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:55,241
Yeah, okay, cool.

1010
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,325
>> Brendan suspects nothing.

1011
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,493
In fact, Brendan still thinks

1012
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,245
we're going to vote J.T. off.

1013
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,747
But in reality, we're cutting

1014
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,039
the head off the dragon and

1015
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,666
sending Brendan home, and I

1016
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,793
feel very happy about that.

1017
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,961
You know, leaders are born.

1018
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:07,712
I'm not saying Brendan is not a

1019
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,630
naturally born leader, but when

1020
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,882
it comes head-to-head, we'll

1021
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,009
see tonight who really was the

1022
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,010
Chosen One.

1023
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,178
It's going to be Coach way.

1024
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,139
So, that's very fulfilling.

1025
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:37,825
>> PROBST: So, you guys have

1026
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,993
spent a little bit of time

1027
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:39,994
together as one tribe.

1028
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:40,536
Erinn, I'm guessing certain

1029
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,206
roles are emerging.

1030
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,415
Who's the person that keeps the

1031
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,166
tribe laughing?

1032
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,251
>> Tyson.

1033
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,252
He just always has some sort of

1034
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,463
offhanded, witty comment to

1035
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,672
make.

1036
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,174
He's kind of the class clown.

1037
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:53,758
>> PROBST: J.T., who tells the

1038
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,259
best campfire stories?

1039
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,345
>> Uh, Coach probably tells the

1040
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,806
best campfire stories, no doubt.

1041
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,723
>> PROBST: Taj, what's the best

1042
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,182
story Coach has told?

1043
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,810
>> Well, I love the Amazon story

1044
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,435
because he told us about how he

1045
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,187
was captured by this tribe and

1046
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,148
he was beaten and he escapes and

1047
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,316
he's, like, paddling for two

1048
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,192
days down the Amazon River to

1049
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,944
get away.

1050
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,320
It's so unbelievable.

1051
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,196
It was incredible.

1052
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:15,822
>> PROBST: Coach, this really

1053
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,364
happened or this is a movie

1054
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,783
version of what you want to

1055
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,867
have happened?

1056
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,743
>> I tried to actually tone it

1057
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,453
down because if I tell them,

1058
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,080
you know, that the tribe was,

1059
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,582
you know, looking at my ass,

1060
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,333
talking about eating my ass,

1061
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,085
so, actually, you know, when I

1062
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,169
tell these stories, I usually

1063
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,296
try to give like the "PG-13"

1064
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,840
version of it.

1065
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,507
>> PROBST: Coach, does it bother

1066
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,299
you that some people might

1067
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,093
question these stories?

1068
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:37,969
>> What I've been through in my

1069
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,012
life, it's pretty fantastic.

1070
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:40,805
I got, you know, scars all over

1071
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,099
my body that I can point to,

1072
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:43,683
of the, you know, five, six,

1073
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:44,642
seven, eight, life or

1074
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,726
death situations I've been

1075
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,727
through.

1076
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,145
PROBST: Five, six, seven, or

1077
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,106
eight life-or-death situations?

1078
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:50,815
>> Probably more than that, I

1079
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,691
mean, if you want me to recount

1080
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,567
them I will.

1081
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,359
I've been through a hurricane.

1082
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,527
I've been attacked by a

1083
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,695
shark, had a run-in with a

1084
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,571
crocodile, got captured by the

1085
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,864
Indian tribe; I mean, there were

1086
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,867
some very defining moments

1087
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,368
in my life where I thought these

1088
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,286
were the last three or four

1089
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:03,536
seconds.

1090
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,370
So, it doesn't bother me

1091
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,289
that people wanna question that.

1092
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,415
They cannot question my

1093
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,834
integrity and my honesty.

1094
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,710
That's how I'm playing this

1095
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,669
game.

1096
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,838
That's how I play my life.

1097
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,589
>> PROBST: From the beginning,

1098
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,381
Coach, you've talked about the

1099
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,592
numbers, sticking together,

1100
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,135
having a strong group.

1101
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,386
Still feel confident about that?

1102
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,429
>> I do feel confident about

1103
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,346
tonight's vote.

1104
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,973
>> PROBST: Tyson, how big is

1105
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,391
trust in tonight's vote?

1106
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,517
>> If one of the Jalapao

1107
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,351
members goes home, then I

1108
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,312
think that Timbiras stayed

1109
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,272
loyal, and if for some reason a

1110
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,732
Timbira tribe member does go

1111
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,192
home, I think everybody will

1112
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,902
seriously rethink, uh, their

1113
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:36,861
strategies.

1114
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,445
>> PROBST: Stephen, how does

1115
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,155
that sit with you?

1116
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,448
What can you do, if anything,

1117
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,574
to change your fate?

1118
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,825
>> You know, in my case, I'm

1119
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,535
just hoping I have enough time

1120
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,245
to get to know more people.

1121
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,040
I'm really glad that J.T. is

1122
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,583
over there with a much larger

1123
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,542
target on his back than I

1124
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,710
have on mine.

1125
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,586
>> PROBST: Taj, do you think

1126
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,462
that's true?

1127
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,588
The people that are the most

1128
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,839
physically threatening at

1129
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,215
challenges are now gonna be

1130
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:58,633
the biggest targets?

1131
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,760
>> Yeah, I definitely think so.

1132
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,178
I mean, J.T. is fast.

1133
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,930
He's a lovable person.

1134
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,014
He's like a triple threat

1135
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,598
because you just can't find

1136
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,308
anything wrong with him.

1137
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,226
>> PROBST: Coach, you agree

1138
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:09,977
with that?

1139
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:10,728
If you're a physical threat in

1140
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:11,854
this game, it's time for you to

1141
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,563
go?

1142
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,564
>> The seven layers of heaven

1143
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,690
with the Vikings were

1144
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,441
determined on how they were

1145
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,526
defeated in battle.

1146
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,028
I want to surround myself with

1147
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:19,987
warriors.

1148
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,113
>> PROBST: So, Brendan...

1149
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,657
>> Even if that means that they

1150
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,449
defeat me, I think that that's

1151
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,993
the honorable way to play this

1152
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,162
game.

1153
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:28,871
>> PROBST: Brendan, biggest

1154
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,248
physical threats going to be the

1155
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,374
first to go?

1156
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:31,999
>> It's natural to kind of want

1157
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,918
to go after the strong, but just

1158
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:34,877
because you're strong doesn't

1159
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,295
mean you go deep in this game.

1160
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,297
>> PROBST: Tyson, has there been

1161
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,091
much talk about the idol and

1162
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,175
that it's hidden, meaning

1163
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,426
somebody might have it and

1164
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,678
nobody knows?

1165
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,804
>> I just assumed that everybody

1166
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,346
that's been to Exile could

1167
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,807
possibly have the idol.

1168
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,891
And if I figure out who has it

1169
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:49,517
then great; if not, everybody

1170
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,686
who's been there has it.

1171
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,436
>> PROBST: Taj, how does that

1172
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:52,770
make you feel?

1173
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,146
You've been to Exile.

1174
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,398
>> I don't have it.

1175
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,023
>> PROBST: Erinn, do you have

1176
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,191
it?

1177
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,109
>> I don't have it.

1178
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:58,818
>> PROBST: Stephen, do you have

1179
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,443
it?

1180
00:37:59,527 --> 00:37:59,652
>> No.

1181
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,319
>> Brendan, do you have it?

1182
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,739
>> I have it.

1183
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,657
>> PROBST: Brendan has it.

1184
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,408
All right, at least we've

1185
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,659
cleared that up.

1186
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,535
You guys ready to get to the

1187
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,620
vote?

1188
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,579
Tyson has the individual

1189
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,414
immunity idol.

1190
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,415
I take it you're keeping it for

1191
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,499
yourself?

1192
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,834
All right, cannot vote for

1193
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,501
Tyson.

1194
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,961
Everybody else is fair game.

1195
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:17,962
It's time to vote.

1196
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,089
J.T., you're up.

1197
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,354
>> The ancient samurai used to

1198
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,648
say that if you wanted to win

1199
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,441
the war, you had to cut off the

1200
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,609
head of the dragon.

1201
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,445
You, my friend, are the dragon,

1202
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,656
and I am the dragonslayer.

1203
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,484
>> This is my wizard lightning

1204
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,527
shooting you back home.

1205
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,696
Ga-bow!

1206
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,913
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1207
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,499
votes.

1208
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,423
If anybody has the hidden

1209
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,424
immunity idol and you want to

1210
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,967
play it, now would be the time

1211
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,511
to do so.

1212
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,517
Okay.

1213
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,643
Once the votes are read,

1214
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,644
the decision is final.

1215
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,186
The person voted out will be

1216
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,187
asked to leave the Tribal

1217
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,230
Council area immediately.

1218
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,690
I'll read the votes.

1219
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,780
First vote: Coach.

1220
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,827
Coach.

1221
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,581
Two votes Coach.

1222
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,042
Brendan.

1223
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:20,584
Two votes Coach;

1224
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:25,840
one vote Brendan.

1225
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,049
Brendan.

1226
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:27,591
Two votes coach;

1227
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,470
two votes Brendan.

1228
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,056
Brendan.

1229
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,474
That's three votes Brendan;

1230
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:42,106
two votes Coach.

1231
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,399
Sierra.

1232
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,483
That's three votes Brendan;

1233
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,693
two votes Coach;

1234
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,697
one vote Sierra.

1235
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,657
Sierra.

1236
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,575
Three votes Brendan;

1237
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,742
two votes Coach;

1238
00:40:53,826 --> 00:41:02,001
two votes Sierra.

1239
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:02,960
We're tied.

1240
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,378
Three votes Sierra;

1241
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:06,130
three votes Brendan;

1242
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:06,630
two votes Coach.

1243
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:11,093
One vote left.

1244
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,219
Eighth person voted out of

1245
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:12,845
<i>Survivor: Tocantins,</i> and the

1246
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,515
first member of our jury:

1247
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,727
Brendan.

1248
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,937
You need to bring me your torch.

1249
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,240
Brendan, the tribe has spoken.

1250
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,409
>> Good luck, fellas.

1251
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,882
>> PROBST: Well, judging by the

1252
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:50,633
amount of smiles, I'd say that

1253
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,469
was a pretty good blindside.

1254
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,720
So much for old tribal

1255
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,596
loyalties.

1256
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,180
This is clearly an individual

1257
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,973
game.

1258
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:58,682
Grab your torches.

1259
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,099
Head back to camp.

1260
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,145

life.

1275

>> I'm trying to explain my

1276
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,087
side so it doesn't look like I

1277
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,255
was the mastermind.

1278
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,005
>> I don't think you were the

1279
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:30,589
mastermind.

1280
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,131
I don't think you're smart

1281
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,466
enough for it.

1282
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:33,592
>> PROBST: Can she save herself?

1283
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,051
>> You made your bed.

1284
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,761
It kills me to have this kid

1285
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,263
here asking me to throw her a

1286
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:37,930
bone.

1287
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,641
It breaks my heart.

1288
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,272
>> I knew at the merge that

1289
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,564
what would happen is I'd

1290
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:47,982
become a big target.

1291
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,567
I didn't think it'd happen

1292
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,527
quite that quickly, um, but it

1293
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,569
kind of feels good to

1294
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,570
blindside because I wanted to

1295
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,071
blindside someone, too.

1296
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,781
That's all part of the game.

1297
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,865
The thing that Sierra probably

1298
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,450
needs most is in my pocket right

1299
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,119
now: the hidden immunity idol.

1300
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,120
But it doesn't matter.

1301
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,121
She'd be next, regardless, to

1302
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:02,830
go.

1303
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,915
It's just a matter of time.
