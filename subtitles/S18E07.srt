<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,047
>> Yes.

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,257
>> PROBST: Brendan and Sierra

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,425
were in possession of the

6
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,261
hidden immunity idol at Timbira.

7
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,137
While their allies, Taj and

8
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,848
Stephen, made the discovery at

9
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,807
Jalapao.

10
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,766
>> Okay, stuff this in your

11
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:16,975
pocket.

12
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,477
Do something with it, hide it.

13
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,564
>> PROBST: Launch.

14
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,149
Spencer's poor defense at the

15
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,068
challenge cost Jalapao immunity.

16
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,320
So J.T. wanted to vote him out.

17
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,655
>> I don't have any problem

18
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,239
writing his name down.

19
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,407
>> I don't want to get rid of

20
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,074
anyone, but it's got to be

21
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,576
Spencer.

22
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,160
>> Everybody can kiss my ass.

23
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,911
>> PROBST: And Taj's

24
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,538
frustration at the loss caught

25
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,789
Joe's attention.

26
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,415
>> Moves like that out here will

27
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,542
get you voted off.

28
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,793
>> PROBST: But Taj was saved

29
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,086
when the tribe came to an

30
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,629
agreement.

31
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,382
Spencer, the tribe has spoken.

32
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,801
Down one member, can Jalapao

33
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,553
regain their momentum?

34
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,888
11 are left.

35
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,015
Who will be voted out tonight?

36
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,402
>> What's up, Big T?

37
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,153
>> Right.

38
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,112
>> Nobody wants to go.

39
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,864
>> They're definitely not going

40
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:13,615
to get any easier, though.

41
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,949
>> I know.

42
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,075
>> It didn't bother me at all

43
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,285
to see Spencer go.

44
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,119
Only the fact that, you know,

45
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,997
if there's a merge at ten,

46
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,165
rather than going in six-four,

47
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,666
we only have a shot at going in

48
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,167
five-five..

49
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,169
Within the tribe right now,

50
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,462
I mean, we're all united.

51
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,422
So if we were to lose again,

52
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,715
it's going to be another tough

53
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,257
one.

54
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:48,983
>> I'm serious, I'm tell you

55
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,818
straight up.

56
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,069
>> I definitely feel nervous

57
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,195
about being a target if we do

58
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,072
end up losing the next immunity

59
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,115
challenge because the boys

60
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,575
might stick together.

61
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,828
Joe is awesome in challenges,

62
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,121
and Stephen and J.T. are always

63
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,164
hanging out together.

64
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,374
So I feel like Taj and I are on

65
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,251
the chopping block.

66
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,966
>> You'll go to the merge.

67
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,259
Sydney's very nervous because

68
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,219
she knows that every time we

69
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,887
lose, she's getting potentially

70
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,972
closer to going home.

71
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,057
And Taj is a very strong

72
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,725
challenger for a spot in the

73
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,768
tribe.

74
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,687
But I think J.T. and Steve trust

75
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,856
Sydney, plus, I got a little

76
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,606
thing for Syd.

77
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,233
I mean, she's gorgeous, so

78
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,401
she's safe.

79
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,111
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

80
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,988
you got a free pass.

81
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,990
>> I'm excited.

But Coach likes the beans cooked

pretty selfish decision.

109

all that stuff in there, and

111
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,421
then he didn't stay out there

112
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:56,879
and tend to the beans.

113
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,506
Instead, he just got inside the

00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,576
that I wanted them to cook

157

longer.

00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,495
just a bad combination.

00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,498
No need to blame anybody.

161
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,540
I know, that's what's eating at

162
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,792
you, and you wanted to say that.

163
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
So thank you for saying that.

164
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,710
I will acknowledge it.

165
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,544
In fact, I'll take full

166
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:18,920
responsibility.

167
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,671
I don't care.

168
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,425
I screwed up the beans, my bad.

169
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,511
Forgive me, all of you.

170
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,678
Especially you, Sierra, who

171
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,721
seems to have the most angst

172
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,347
about it.

173
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,972

174
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,641
different way, maybe you should

175
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,351
make it in a different pot.

00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,331
That's for the best of just

194
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:55,957
you."

195
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,416
But while he does do some

196
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,293
irritating things, I totally

197
00:06:59,377 --> 00:06:59,794
accept it because he's a

198
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,587
predictable player.

199
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,131
And predictable in this game

200
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,091
is-is great.

201
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:16,602
>> I know.

202
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,645
They're so good, though.

203
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,479
>> I know.

204
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,732
It's day 16, and it's getting

205
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,234
strange around here.

206
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,153
Jalapao has only five tribe

207
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,070
members left.

208
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,363
Hopefully, everyone's got a good

209
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:27,697
outlook on me.

210
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,032
I am a country boy, you know,

211
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,534
and it's hard for me to be mean

212
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,618
to people.

213
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,078
I've been honest with everyone

214
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:34,704
here at Jalapao so far, and I'm

215
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,622
gonna do my best to stay that

216
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:36,789
way.

217
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,833
Hopefully, everyone's being

218
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,043
honest with me as well.

219
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,424
(Taj laughs)

220
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,133
>> What do you think?

221
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:47,758
>> No, it'll work.

222
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,718
I just heard it cracking.

223
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,392
>> Well, I just think it will

224
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,894
solidify that I trust him

225
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,437
enough, you know, to tell him

226
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,854
the truth.

227
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,980
>> I just think it might make

228
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,024
him wary of you.

229
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,776
>> Mm, I see what you're saying.

230
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,069
>> After the last Tribal

231
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,280
Council, when J.T. voted for

232
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,948
Spencer over me, I-I just...

233
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,491
that's when I knew that he was

234
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,868
definitely in our corner.

235
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,665
>> Taj came and said, "I want to

236
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,251
tell J.T. about the idol."

237
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,128
Until J.T. knows, I'm basically

238
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,297
controlling the information flow

239
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,715
between Taj and J.T. and to the

240
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,218
extent possible, I want to

241
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,844
remain that bridge because if

242
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,221
they connect, you know, I might

243
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,388
become a less essential part of

244
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,223
the loop.

245
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:35,973
He's going to trust me less,

246
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,766
too.

247
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,350
J.T. will if we tell him about

248
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,392
the idol.

249
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,060
>> I wasn't gonna implicate

250
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:39,644
you at all.

251
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,186
>> Right, I'm just saying.

252
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,187
You haven't...

253
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,771
>> The real alliance for me

254
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,482
is my four-person alliance once

255
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,566
the merge happens, which is

256
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,069
Steve, Brendan, Sierra, and

257
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,070
myself.

258
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:49,654
Here I just want to make it to

259
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,323
the merge, and with J.T. on my

260
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,824
side, I'm going to be in good

261
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,575
shape.

262
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,201
>> So, you're not going to tell

263
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,078
him about Brendan then?

264
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:57,870
>> Oh, no, no, no.

265
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,287
Just about the idol.

266
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,330
>> Okay.

267
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,665
>> Yeah, just about the idol.

268
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,379
>> No, I'm not sure at all.

269
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,756
>> Okay.

270
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:22,186
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

271
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,104
Timbira getting your first look

272
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,981
at the new Jalapao tribe.

273
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,565
Spencer voted out at the last

274
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:26,941
Tribal Council.

275
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,777
>> Crazy.

276
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,070
>> PROBST: Guys ready to get to

277
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:31,988
today's challenge?

278
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:32,947
>> Yeah!

279
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,656
>> PROBST: For today's

280
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,740
challenge, each tribe will have

281
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,200
five minutes to build a

282
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,952
barricade inside the other

283
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,370
tribe's frame.

284
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:39,996
You will then attempt to toss

285
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,456
ceramic pigs through the

286
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,250
barricade the other tribe built

287
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,710
in your frame.

288
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,044
If you drop a pig or if it

289
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,171
breaks, it doesn't count.

290
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,214
The tribe with the most pigs on

291
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:50,840
their bench at the end of ten

292
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,551
minutes wins reward.

293
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,343
Want to know what you're

294
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:54,927
playing for?

295
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:55,845
>> Yeah!

296
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,387
>> PROBST: The winning tribe

297
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,055
will be taken to a beautiful

298
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,683
waterfall where you will enjoy

299
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,562
a relaxing afternoon barbecue.

300
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,731
Hamburgers, all the fixings.

301
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,691
In addition, the winning tribe

302
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,318
will choose one member from the

303
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,277
losing tribe to go to Exile

304
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,777
Island.

305
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,071
That person will in turn choose

306
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:14,697
somebody from the winning tribe

307
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,491
to join them, which means

308
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,201
somebody from the winning tribe

309
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,828
will not partake in the reward.

310
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,080
I know it's worth playing for.

311
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:23,873
Timbira, you have one extra

312
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,333
member, sitting somebody out.

313
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,250
Cannot sit out the same person

314
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,668
in back-to-back challenges.

315
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,210
Who's going to sit this one

316
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,795
out?

317
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,046
>> Erinn.

318
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,505
>> PROBST: Erinn, take a spot

319
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,131
on the bench.

320
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:32,798
Everybody else, we'll get

321
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,841
started.

322
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,470
Here we go, first stage.

323
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,554
Each tribe will have five

324
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:40,139
minutes to build a barricade in

325
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,515
the other tribe's frame.

326
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:41,891
Survivors ready?

327
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,808
Go!

328
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,354
>> Come on, guys!

329
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,730
>> PROBST: The idea is to make

330
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,358
this as impenetrable as possible

331
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,609
so the other tribe can't get

332
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,861
their pig through.

333
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,779
>> Right here, just like that.

334
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,572
>> We need to put all these in

335
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,366
the front.

336
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:58,741
>> That solid?

337
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,867
>> No.

338
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,702
>> They're building X's.

339
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,454
>> Look what they're doing.

340
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,955
>> PROBST: Four minutes left.

341
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,958
You need to make them count.

342
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,637
>> PROBST: Five,

343
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,763
four,

344
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,014
three,

345
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,140
two,

346
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,183
one.

347
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,267
Stop the work.

348
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,396
That's it.

349
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,316
All right, each tribe now has

350
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,692
ten minutes to get as many

351
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,069
ceramic pigs through the

352
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,695
barricade built by the other

353
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,988
tribe as you can.

354
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,615
Tribe with the most pigs at the

355
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,575
end of ten minutes wins reward.

356
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,827
Survivors ready?

357
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,869
Go.

358
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,286
>> Come on, guys.

359
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,663
>> PROBST: Can only throw one

360
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,705
pig at a time.

361
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,040
If it drops or it breaks like

362
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,835
that one, doesn't count.

363
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:52,878
>> Sorry.

364
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,963
Next.

365
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:54,797
>> Come on, guys!

366
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,715
>> PROBST: A lot of pigs

367
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,133
breaking right now.

368
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,718
Big learning curve here.

369
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,554
Brendan to Tyson.

370
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,098
Easily to Coach.

371
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,683
Coach to Sierra.

372
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,267
Timbira is on the board with

373
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:06,892
their first point.

374
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,311
There's one through.

375
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,229
Joe to J.T.

376
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:10,938
J.T. trying to get it to Sydney.

377
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,232
Low again.

378
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,151
Tyson and Coach have a good

379
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,193
rhythm going.

380
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,237
Timbira now with two.

381
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,196
>> Come on, Joe.

382
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,989
>> Okay.

383
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,449
>> PROBST: Nice catch by Coach.

384
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,658
Timbira on a roll.

385
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,827
Timbira now with three pigs.

386
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,953
>> Catch this one.

387
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,955
>> PROBST: J.T. to Sydney.

388
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,290
This time they connect.

389
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,583
Jalapao on the board with their

390
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,334
first pig.

391
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,753
Timbira now with four to one.

392
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,130
Those pigs hurt when they hit

393
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,173
your body.

394
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,507
>> Come on, Syd.

395
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,842
>> Nice catch by Sydney.

396
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,885
That's two for Jalapao.

397
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,971
Timbira with the fifth pig.

398
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,056
It's five-two.

399
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,807
Tyson to Coach.

400
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,477
Timbira with another one.

401
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,437
Sydney with another nice catch.

402
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,646
J.T. and Sydney have something

403
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,439
good going.

404
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,524
Jalapao starting to catch up.

405
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:55,983
J.T. to Sydney.

406
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,320
That's six-four, Timbira leads.

407
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,030
That's seven for Timbira.

408
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,283
>> Coach.

409
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,493
>> That's all right, Tyson.

410
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,076
You're the man.

411
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,452
You're the man.

412
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,745
You're the man.

413
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,829
>> PROBST: That's seven-five.

414
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,874
That's eight for Timbira.

415
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,877
That's six for Jalapao.

416
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,795
Tyson breaks another one.

417
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,130
>> All right, man, we got it.

418
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,465
>> PROBST: Timbira starting to

419
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,800
fall apart.

420
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,927
We are now eight-seven.

421
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,222
Joe to J.T., J.T. to Sydney.

422
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,307
Yes, we are tied eight-eight!

423
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,352
Jalapao is back in it now.

424
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,061
Timbira nine.

425
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,355
Jalapao eight.

426
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:34,897
J.T. to Sydney.

427
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,067
We are tied again nine-nine.

428
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,943
Three minutes left.

429
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,487
Jalapao now in the lead.

430
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,738
Ten-nine.

431
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,113
>> Come on, Joe.

432
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,158
>> Come on, Joe.

433
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,493
>> Tyson, you're throwing them

434
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,410
too hard, buddy.

435
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,036
>> PROBST: Jalapao now with 11.

436
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,996
Jalapao has come from behind,

437
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,124
is now leading this challenge.

438
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,961
Jalapao with their 12th.

439
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,171
Timbira now with 11.

440
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,215
Brendan to Tyson.

441
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:01,966
Tyson snakes it through to

442
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,592
Coach.

443
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:03,968
Timbira now at 12.

444
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,804
It is neck and neck.

445
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,096
>> Come on.

446
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,307
>> PROBST: One minute left.

447
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,892
Tyson to Coach.

448
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,394
Timbira with another one.

449
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,271
Timbira now in the lead, 13-12.

450
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,105
J.T. to Sydney.

451
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,149
That's 13, Jalapao.

452
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,694
We are tied 13-13.

453
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,237
30 seconds left.

454
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,446
Jalapao, you've got to make

455
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,489
these count.

456
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,407
>> I got it.

457
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,075
>> Let's go, guys. Let's go.

458
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,036
>> PROBST: Time running out.

459
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,331
We are still tied 13-13.

460
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:34,999
Ten seconds.

461
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,042
>> Catch it!

462
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,503
>> Come on, guys.

463
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,588
>> PROBST: Five, four...

464
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,505
>> We got it.

465
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,381
You betcha.

466
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,382
>> PROBST: three...

467
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,925
two, one.

468
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,926
That's it!

469
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,176
(cheering)

470
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,053
Timbira wins reward.

471
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,013
>> Give me the pig!

472
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,140
Let me smash it!

473
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,478
>> PROBST: Timbira,

474
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,062
congratulations.

475
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,565
All right, first decision.

476
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,149
Who from Jalapao are you going

477
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,984
to send to Exile Island?

478
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,028
>> Right now, everything with

479
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,280
Brendan, Sierra, and Stephen is

480
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,156
in place.

481
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,866
We have both idols.

482
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,909
We have the alliance intact.

483
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,745
So, when Timbira had to send

484
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,538
someone to Exile Island, all I

485
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,164
kept thinking was, send someone

486
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,541
else.

487
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,125
>> Joe.

488
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,085
>> PROBST: Joe going to Exile

489
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:20,336
Island.

490
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,879
Joe, grab your personal items.

491
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,881
Come on over.

492
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,549
Joe, now you have a little

493
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,133
power.

494
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,217
You get to pick somebody from

495
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,261
Timbira to join you on Exile,

496
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,971
and you will keep them from the

497
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,806
waterfall, burgers, all the

498
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,350
fixings.

499
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,894
>> Uh... come on, Erinn.

500
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,147
The decision to bring Erinn with

501
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,981
me to Exile was strategic

502
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,525
because going into a merge,

503
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,027
we need somebody to flip, and my

504
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,655
charm game is definitely part of

505
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,697
my strategy, and she's an

506
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,741
attractive woman.

507
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,784
>> PROBST: Who wants the map?

508
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,785
>> He can take it.

509
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,952
>> I'll take it.

510
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:54,953
>> PROBST: All right, guys.

511
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:55,371
Head out to Exile.

512
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,456
You'll both return in time for

513
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,082
the next immunity challenge.

514
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,668
Timbira, ready for a fun

515
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,877
afternoon?

516
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,544
>> Absolutely!

517
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,295
>> Like nothing else.

518
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,171
>> PROBST: Grab your stuff.

519
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,005
Head out. Enjoy it.

520
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,215
>> Bye, guys.

521
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,383
>> Thanks.

522
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,093
See you, guys.

523
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,427
>> PROBST: All right, guys.

524
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,720
I got nothing for you.

525
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,097
Jalapao, head back to camp.

526
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,473
>> We definitely lost a reward

527
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,849
today, and it sucked, but I'm

528
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,392
not going to feel sorry for

529
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,226
myself all day.

530
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,103
I mean, I don't really care

531
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:19,937
about the reward.

532
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,854
It's just a reward.

533
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,480
But if we lose the next immunity

534
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,774
challenge, we go down six-four

535
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,734
in numbers, so we just can't

536
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,151
blow it.

537
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:40,416
We need to win.

538
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,168
(squealing excitedly)

539
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,629
>> Yep.

540
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,714
>> High five, man.

541
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,757
>> Oh, yeah!

542
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,050
>> When we walked into the

543
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,343
reward, we saw, like, the

544
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,303
perfect all-American picnic.

545
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,097
I mean, watermelon, chips,

546
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,098
cooler of drinks.

547
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,183
>> Look, there's hamburgers

548
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,059
over there on the grill!

549
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,980
Oh, my God!

550
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:03,605
>> I'm going to eat enough to

551
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,274
puke, and then I have room for

552
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,568
hamburgers after that.

553
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,277
>> Oh, yum.

554
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,155
>> Oh, my God!

555
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,990
>> Oh, my gosh!

556
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:13,365
>> Unbelievable.

557
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,159
>> The first bite of the burger

558
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,829
was just like heaven, basically.

559
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,164
>> There's so much food that I

560
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,666
can't fit enough in my mouth.

561
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,543
>> Manners were out the window.

562
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,211
Eating as much as we could.

563
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,297
I mean, we were like animals.

564
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,136
>> Oh, my gosh!

565
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,471
>> Oh, my God, look at that

566
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,974
waterfall.

567
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,101
>> This is so amazing.

568
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,025
>> The water is just so crystal

569
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:48,233
clear.

570
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,194
It's beautiful.

571
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,489
>> Oh, wow.

572
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,156
>> A small part of me feels

573
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,658
guilty that Erinn is not here,

574
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,993
but in my opinion, she's lucky

575
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,119
to still be in this game.

576
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,829
These people right here, uh,

577
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,455
from the tribe, these are the

578
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,415
people I would have picked to be

579
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,541
enjoying this with.

580
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,918
>> Go.

581
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,127
(cheering)

582
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,087
>> All in all, a great win,

583
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:09,963
great day.

584
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,422
There's no bickering.

585
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,090
It's awesome.

586
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:12,716
It's good to feel that momentum

587
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,342
back, especially this late in

588
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,010
the game.

589
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,137
(laughter)

590
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,731
>> "You must each choose an

591
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,774
urn."

592
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,234
I insist.

593
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,402
Ladies first.

594
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,455
>> All right, he's out.

595
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,373
I'll see you in a while.

596
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:44,623
>> Later.

597
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,708
>> Joe and I came out to Exile,

598
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,669
picked two urns, and I got the

599
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,753
one with the clue in it.

600
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,379
It's very apparent that the idol

601
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,380
is not here.

602
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,382
It's back at camp.

603
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,883
And if it's back at camp,

604
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,260
there's more than one, so now I

605
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,262
just need to figure out: do I

606
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,429
trust Joe?

607
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,514
Do I not trust Joe?

608
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,223
Because I have no alliances out

609
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,224
here.

610
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,269
So, he could be a good ally, and

611
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,854
if we were aligned and had two

612
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,689
idols, that might not be a bad

613
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,107
thing for us.

614
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,066
>> So, who's your favorite over

615
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:11,608
there?

616
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,526
>> I don't know about favorites.

617
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,443
Can you have favorites in this?

618
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,528
How about you?

619
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,113
>> Uh, J.T.

620
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:16,572
J.T. is a good dude.

621
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,075
>> Yeah, he seems like it.

622
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:21,285
>> We'll be up and running here

623
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,619
soon.

624
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,245
Need any help with those clues?

625
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,204
>> Oh, maybe.

626
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,205
I'll let you know.

627
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,206
>> Let me know.

628
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,332
Maybe we can work on it together

629
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,333
or something.

630
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,627
I picked the empty urn, and I

631
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,962
have no clue where the idol is.

632
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:32,588
Uh, I think she knows where it's

633
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,256
at, so hopefully I can just get

634
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,717
it out of her, but we'll see how

635
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:36,925
it goes.

636
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,427
There's got to be one out here,

637
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,428
you know.

638
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,431
Let's go find both of them.

639
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,225
They're at camp?

640
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,020
>> I decided I was going to tell

641
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,105
Joe about the idol.

642
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,190
I'm hoping that Joe turns out to

643
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,192
be a trustworthy individual.

644
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,527
"Go to the spot where you often

645
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,361
get mail.

646
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,529
"Don't skirt the issue.

647
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,824
Try lifting the veil."

648
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,658
>> It's right there.

649
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,284
>> Yeah.

650
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,327
>> Your tree mail.

651
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,870
>> Easy if it's still there.

652
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,538
>> I'll let you know, all right?

653
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,664
>> Good stuff.

654
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,707
>> This couldn't be any better

655
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,249
right now.

656
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,417
I picked the empty urn, and now

657
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,376
I know where the idol is.

658
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,753
If Erinn and I both get the

659
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,421
immunity idol, that's a

660
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,756
humongous alliance.

661
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,633
It could probably rival anything

662
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,468
that I have back at... at camp.

663
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,595
(squawking)

664
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,599
>> When Joe comes back, he's

665
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,059
going to have enough clues to

666
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,435
find the idol in about 30

667
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,686
seconds.

668
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,854
>> Right, so we need to put

669
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,773
something in the tree mail ASAP.

670
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,441
>> I have some stuff.

671
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,817
I have some feathers.

672
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,152
I have some leather straps.

673
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,236
>> That will be fine.

674
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,071
I mean, anything that looks

675
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:39,947
authentic.

676
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,782
When Joe comes back from Exile

677
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,325
looking for the immunity idol,

678
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,785
he'll have all the clues, so

679
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,912
he'll know to look inside tree

680
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,580
mail, and I don't want him to

681
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,373
know that I already have it, so

682
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,167
I need to make the best-looking

683
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,543
little fake idol that I can come

684
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,087
up with.

685
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,463
I just went to pick up the real

686
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,341
idol from Stephen's pants pocket

687
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,176
just to know what it looks like

688
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,386
so I can make it look authentic

689
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,595
and genuine.

690
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,180
Hopefully, I'll be able to throw

691
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,308
Joe off.

692
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,994
(chuckling)

693
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,606
>> Yeah.

694
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,243
>> Stephen and I was going

695
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,244
fishing.

696
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,787
So, I go to grab an empty bag,

697
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,790
and right on top is the hidden

698
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,918
immunity idol.

699
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,590
Apparently, Taj found the idol.

700
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,469
And I was like, "Oh, my God."

701
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,808
>> I know it's right there!

702
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,019
When J.T. found the idol, I was

703
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,022
thinking what the heck do I say?

704
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,440
So I said, "I know," and, you

705
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,734
know, I don't think I had the

706
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,069
appropriate amount of shock on

707
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,196
my face.

708
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,409
>> Do you think she just now

709
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,619
found it?

710
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,536
>> Yeah.

711
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,207
>> Or that's good.

712
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:55,791
I mean, I think she was just

713
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,458
worried, you know, about the

714
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,584
next vote, so wanted to make

715
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,379
sure we were all on board.

716
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,464
>> Yeah.

717
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,841
>> Yeah.

718
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,884
>> Oh, we-we got a hidden

719
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,012
immunity idol at camp.

720
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,686
>> J.T.?

721
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,437
>> Yeah.

722
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,438
>> Yeah.

723
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,981
>> I wanted to just talk to Taj

724
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,400
to tell her that J.T. found the

725
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,194
idol in her bag.

726
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,946
And she has to tell J.T. that

727
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,531
she has it so the three of us

728
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,658
are on the same page.

729
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,453
>> J.T.

730
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,289
Look.

731
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,458
I got you some puka berries.

732
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,751
>> Oh, I-I seen this a while

733
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,544
ago before I left.

734
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:40,836
>> Did you?

735
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,129
>> Yes.

736
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:42,921
>> How?

737
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,341
>> I walked over here...

738
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,342
That is beautiful.

739
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:47,801
>> Isn't it gorgeous?

740
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,552
>> That is beautiful.

741
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,637
It's a necklace, isn't it?

742
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,638
>> Yeah.

743
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,639
>> You got to hide it 'cause

744
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:52,973
it might be...

745
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,432
>> Where should I put it?

746
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,308
>> I can't believe it's the real

747
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,059
immunity idol.

748
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,060
>> I know!

749
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:57,686
Honestly, I don't want you and

750
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,063
Stephen to go out prematurely

751
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:00,480
for no reason.

752
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,525
If you need it, you can have it.

753
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,526
I'm serious.

754
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,527
>> All right.

755
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,154
Taj showed me the idol.

756
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,738
I think she felt like she could

757
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,740
trust me, and her sharing this

758
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,367
information was huge.

promise to me that any time that

I may need the hidden immunity

762
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,373
idol, she would give it to me.

That's a big promise, you know.

765
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,670
Hopefully, she'll keep it.

00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,511
>> Here.

768
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,138
All right, now everybody give me

theirs hands.

that they found the idol before

Taj showed it to me.

It took her a little while to

780

come around, but she was honest.

781
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,575

releasing sand from a tower.

806

completely break those first two

900

tiles, so not enough sand is

901
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,537
leaking out, which means J.T.'s

902
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,622
target on that third tile will

903
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,249
not get any larger than it is

904
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:29,874

00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,424
Nobody else has fired a shot.

922
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,986
>> Jet, you want to keep going?

923
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,529

Time to pick up the pace now.

931
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,167
Firing as fast as he can.

932
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,169
Trying to get Jalapao back in

00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,170
this.

934
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:15,795
Brendan and Erinn take their

time with a big lead on the

936
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,090
puzzle.

937
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:19,883
>> Like that.

938
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,300
>> Oh, yeah, okay.

939

00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,969
different spots.

>> PROBST: J.T. connects.

947
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,148
Now the sand starts to pour out.

948
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:35,940
That'll do it.

949
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:36,941
>> Yes!

950
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:37,275
>> Yes, J.T.!

951
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,735
>> PROBST: Jalapao's third bag

952
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,903
is released.

953
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,112
J.T. has it.

954
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,322
Start working on the puzzle,

955
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:42,906
Jalapao.

956
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,700
>> Come on, Joe.

957
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:46,701
>> PROBST: Steven and Joe

958
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:47,744
working on the puzzle for

959
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:48,786
Jalapao.

960
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,954
Timbira has had a big head

961
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,789
start, tough puzzle, still time.

962
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,083
Jalapao could be right back in

963
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,418
this.

964
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,211
>> Nope.

965
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,003
No, it doesn't fit.

966
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,004
>> Hold on, one more.

967
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,422
>> That fits, there.

968
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,256
>> Okay.

969
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,049
>> PROBST: Brendan and Erinn

970
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,302
slowly figuring out the puzzle.

971
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,303
>> I got one.

972
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,346
>> PROBST: Joe with the first

973
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,847
piece for Jalapao.

974
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,265
Timbira thinks they have another

975
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,266
piece.

976
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,267
>> Hustle, hustle, guys.

977
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,268
>> There's two.

978
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,269
>> PROBST: Jalapao starting to

979
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,270
pick it up now.

980
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,271
>> Is that it?

981
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,022
>> Yep, yep, yep.

982
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,192
Oh, look at that. Look at that.

983
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,194
>> Fits.

984
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,196
>> No, keep trying.

985
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,989
>> That's it, okay.

986
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,199
>> There it is right here.

987
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,200
Right here.

988
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,201
>> Ooh.

989
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:28,993
>> No, that-that's it right

990
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:29,994
there, and spin it.

991
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,205
Got it.

992
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,206
>> PROBST: Timbira thinks they

993
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,833
have it.

994
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,834
And they do.

995
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:37,835
Timbira wins immunity!

996
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,962
(cheering)

997
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,678
>> Oh, J.T., it's okay.

998
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,680
>> Don't beat yourself up.

999
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,097
>> PROBST: Timbira,

1000
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,473
congratulations.

1001
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,099
Once again immunity is yours.

1002
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:51,891
>> Thank you.

1003
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,977
>> Awesome.

1004
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,019
>> PROBST: What's it feel like

1005
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,062
right now, Coach, knowing no

1006
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,689
chance I'm going home tonight?

1007
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,690
>> It's incredible.

1008
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,066
And I really think that this was

1009
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,900
so pivotal, this win, because it

1010
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,026
really shifts control of the

1011
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,027
game.

1012
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,821
>> PROBST: Timbira, grab your

1013
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,029
stuff.

1014
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:05,446
Head back to camp.

1015
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,073
Enjoy the night off.

1016
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,076
Jalapao, I got nothing for you

1017
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,869
except a date with me once again

1018
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,080
at Tribal Council, where one of

1019
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,123
you will be going home.

1020
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,124
Grab your stuff.

1021
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,125
Head back to camp.

1022
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,751
I will see you at Tribal.

1023
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,545
>> It's not a good thing to go

1024
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,463
to Tribal Council.

1025
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,882
I've been told by Joe I am safer

1026
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,093
than Taj, but you know, no one's

1027
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,053
safe at this point.

1028
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:38,021
And it really just sucks.

1029
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:43,067
♪ ♪

1030
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,695
>> Damn!

1031
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,071
I'm sorry, guys.

1032
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,364
>> Man, I want to say nobody

1033
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,574
blames you at all.

1034
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,575
>> No, not at all.

1035
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,576
>> It's hard not to.

1036
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,368
>> Every challenge you're at,

1037
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,661
you give your all, and like this

1038
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,246
time it didn't work out as well.

1039
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,873
>> Are you all right, man?

1040
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,666
>> Your leg looks bad.

1041
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,251
It's red all the way down from

1042
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,669
the knee to the ankle.

1043
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,880
>> Pretty painful.

1044
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,469
This should be good, like,

1045
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,137
tomorrow.

1046
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,016
>> Oh, man, that place sucks.

1047
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,809
What do you think?

1048
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,602
>> No way?

1049
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,394
You didn't?

1050
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,437
>> I let her go first.

1051
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,773
I go, "I insist."

1052
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,357
>> She didn't show it to you?

1053
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,066
>> I tried to juice her for

1054
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,859
info.

1055
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:25,526
>> Nothing?

1056
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,235
>><i> Nada.</i>

1057
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:26,694
>> Wow, that's weird.

1058
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,529
>> It was a long two days, man.

1059
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,657
>> I need some water.

1060
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,002
(laughing)

1061
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,004
>> At Exile, Erinn gave me a

1062
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,006
scroll with five clues on it,

1063
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,008
and it was really easy.

1064
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,552
I mean, I walked up and got the

1065
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,346
idol in literally ten seconds.

1066
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,180
This is the hidden immunity

1067
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,140
idol.

1068
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,266
"Don't skirt the issue.

1069
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,393
Try lifting the veil.

1070
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:58,726
Here it is."

1071
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,019
I was stoked.

1072
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,521
Just pure relief.

1073
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,606
Now I feel like I got a great

1074
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,734
shot at extra time in this game.

1075
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,211
>> Tonight, we are all voting

1076
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,212
for Taj.

1077
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,880
Joe made sure we were all on the

1078
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,173
same page, and that's that.

1079
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,009
I think Taj knows something's

1080
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,554
up, but she's not someone who's

1081
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,888
trying to stab people behind

1082
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,265
their backs or trying to talk

1083
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,558
crap right before we have Tribal

1084
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,559
Council.

1085
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:44,063
She's not that kind of person.

1086
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,441
>> I don't believe I have

1087
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,483
anything to worry about tonight

1088
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,401
at Tribal Council.

1089
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,610
I think I have Stephen and

1090
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,154
J.T.'s trust completely, and

1091
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,489
plus I have the idol.

1092
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,782
>> Yeah, it's perfect.

1093
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,617
>> I think Sydney believes

1094
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,201
everything is going to work in

1095
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,328
her favor because Joe is going

1096
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,121
to protect her, but I'm pretty

1097
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,164
confident tonight I'm not going.

1098
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,208
(laughs)

1099
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,891
>> Yeah.

1100
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,017
>> Taj, myself, and Stephen have

1101
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,685
a tight alliance right now, and

1102
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,145
Taj has got the hidden immunity

1103
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,897
idol that I could use.

1104
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,481
You know, that's just like my

1105
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,400
idol, and there's no way I could

1106
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,943
vote my hidden immunity idol out

1107
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,945
of this game right now.

1108
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,238
He's gonna want to know why it's

1109
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:44,040
got to be Sydney and not Taj.

1110
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,042
>> Whoo!

1111
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,752
Oh, dude.

1112
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,795
>> It feels good, don't it?

1113
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,922
>> Yeah, man.

1114
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,323
>> We should at least talk about

1115
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:21,828
it.

1116
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,371
>> I go to the water to talk

1117
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,289
with J.T. and Steve, and they

1118
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,958
got this crazy look in their eye

1119
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,377
about keeping Taj.

1120
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,419
They started talking out all

1121
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,588
these plans that could happen,

1122
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,382
but I kind of envisioned Taj

1123
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,967
being the odd man out and going

1124
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,886
home should we lose.

1125
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:49,063
I need to try to honor that.

1126
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,358
The three of us were not in any

1127
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,693
agreement on who to vote for

1128
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,194
tonight, and if J.T. and Steve--

1129
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,362
they don't really give me

1130
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,198
consideration, then I might hand

1131
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,783
over the idol to Sydney and make

1132
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,410
a point.

1133

You have the idol.

1142
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,528

1152

1318
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,916
>> PROBST: You need to bring me

1319
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,043
your torch.

1320
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:38,013
Sydney, the tribe has spoken.

1321
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,736
Well, there was a lot of

1322
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,072
discussion tonight about a

1323
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,073
possible merge.

1324
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,574
If indeed you guys merge down

1325
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,158
two members, you've got your

1326
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:58,659
work cut out for you.

1327
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,660
Grab your torches.

1328
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,661
Head back to camp.

1329
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,830
Good night.

00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,643
>> Congratulations, tribe.

1342
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,477
You have merged.

1343
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,271
(cheering)

1344
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:27,855
>> If the old Timbira were to

1345
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,150
stay together, we can eliminate

1346
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:34,069
them one by one by one.

1347
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,404
>> We're going into this four on

1348
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,405
six.

1349
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:36,864
That's not good odds.

1350
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,949
We're sitting ducks.

1351
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,873
>> I'm pissed I was voted off.

1352
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,166
Jalapao is in trouble if there's

1353
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:47,833
a merge.

1354
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,294
They are down the numbers, and I

1355
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:50,878
don't really see anyone from

1356
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,006
Timbira switching over, but Taj

1357
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,591
might try to do something.

1358
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,176
It was a great experience, and

1359
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:57,760
being able to look back on it

1360
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,678
and say that I got to do that is

1361
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,847
a blessing in itself, so I feel

1362
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,808
very lucky.
