00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,462
<i>Survivor:</i>
Four days without fire or water

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,631
took its toll.
>> Dehydration may be our

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,591
biggest concern.
>> PROBST: A mystery box with

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,927
three locks was discovered at
tree mail.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,221
>> Oh-oh.
We see a big crate.

7
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,057
We have no idea what's inside.
>> It feels like something

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,268
substantial, whatever it is.
>> PROBST: At the reward

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,729
challenge, Ethan led Saboga to a
comeback.

10
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,691
>> Saboga wins reward!
The reward was a choice

11
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:28,570
between blankets or flint to
make fire and a clue to the

12
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,072
first key of their lockbox,
which they learned contained

13
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,741
rice.
>> Oh, man.

14
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,452
>> PROBST: There's a rub.
If you choose the flint, Mogo

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,120
Mogo gets it, as well as
Chapera.

16
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,789
>> SUSAN: (<i> laughs</i> )
>> PROBST: Saboga chose the

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,791
flint and gave all three tribes
fire.

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,378
>> Fire! Yay!
>> PROBST: At Saboga...

19
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,464
>> My foot sort of makes
me limp a little.

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,468
>> Rudy's not doing okay.
His feet-- he did something to

21
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,928
the bone inside.
>> PROBST: At the immunity

22
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,306
challenge, Saboga faced another
setback...

23
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,517
Saboga's still bailing water!
When they finish a distant

24
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,478
third.
For the second straight time,

25
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,939
Saboga going to Tribal Council.
Rudy's injury and Ethan's status

26
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,485
as a previous winner put both of
them on the chopping block.

27
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,863
But when the votes came in, it
was Rudy who took the fall.

28
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:17,827
Rudy, the tribe has spoken.
16 are left.

29
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:23,166
Who will be voted out tonight?

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION NETWORK
>> Bug bites are bad.

32
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,595
And, you know, my problem is
that I couldn't resist the urge

33
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,389
to scratch them.
It was more than I could bear,

34
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,726
and now I'm definitely paying
for it because I think that

35
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,770
they get way, way worse when
you scratch them.

36
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,732
They raise up and they become
kind of like little open sores,

37
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,734
open wounds.
And then the salt water gets

38
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,153
into them and it feels like
fire.

39
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:21,784
It's horrible.
>> Honey, you're going to get

40
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,120
scars.
>> I'm not scratching them.

41
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,122
I'm just rubbing.
Ugh!

42
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,292
This is bad.
They're like bug bites on top of

43
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,878
bug bites on top of...
We look like freaks.

44
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,630
Bigger freaks than we already
are.

45
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,298
>> You cannot be itching
yourself, girl.

46
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,091
We talked about that.
>> I can't stop myself.

47
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,802
>> You just have to, like,
endure about half an hour of...

48
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,638
>> Itchiness?
>> ...itchiness, and then

49
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,181
it won't itch anymore.
>> This is like the

50
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,474
hardest thing I've ever done
to not itch right now.

51
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,478
>> Your arms are messed up now.
>> I hate everything right now.

52
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,855
Not you guys, but I want to go
home.

53
00:03:50,939 --> 00:04:01,115
>> Oh, God, Jenna.
>> Jenna's hurting.

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,328
Jenna wants to go home.
Um, first of all, Jenna's not

55
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,497
eating.
I don't know what that's all

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,667
about.
You know, I think that first

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,213
four days where we had no water
and no food really put her body

58
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,424
into a tailspin where she's
feeling it today.

59
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,843
And now she's not even drinking
enough.

60
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,179
I have to push her to drink.
She won't go in the water to

61
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,014
cool her body down.
She's just not taking

62
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,225
directions.
She's kind of a wandering

63
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:31,062
zombie.
>> It seems to be tough for

64
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,064
her this time around.
>> Yeah, it's tough.

65
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,358
>> Especially mentally.
>> Mm-hmm.

66
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,360
>> I don't think she's happy.
>> She's really not.

67
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:47,412
She's really not happy.
>> We're going to dig

68
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:52,667
She's really not happy.
>> We're going to dig

69
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,631
some holes and bury these like
this and sit that on top.

70
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,343
>> I don't know exactly
what has got into the tribe.

71
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,721
This morning, they want to do
stuff.

72
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,724
It's a little bit of missing
Rudy, a little bit of guilt, a

73
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,892
little everything.
There's a lot of nervous energy.

74
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,230
It's getting everybody going.
>> Without being

75
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:18,067
overconfident or cocky, I'm
feeling really good about where

76
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,071
we're at.
Yay!

77
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,907
>> That's cute.
>> The four of us left

78
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,327
in this tribe are family, and we
work really well together.

79
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,706
>> Oh, another little one.
>> A little guy.

80
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,583
Better than eating them damn
snails.

81
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,962
>> Where'd you find that guy?
>> Right there.

82
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:48,056
>> All right, try this out.
(<i> Rupert chuckling</i> )

83
00:05:48,139 --> 00:06:00,109
>> All right, try this out.
(<i> Rupert chuckling</i> )

84
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,613
>> As soon as I brought
the fish back, Ethan's grabbing

85
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,617
his spear and running out there.
(<i> chuckles</i> )

86
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,952
I tried to tell him it's not a
competition.

87
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,707
It's really not.
>> I hope he catches something.

88
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:20,129
That'd be good for his ego.
>> I mean, those

89
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,007
triggerfish swim into a nook.
You just got to jab them.

90
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:29,055
>> You jab 'em.
>> Just couldn't do it.

91
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:33,267
>> You'll get better.
I like being the fisherman.

92
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,980
I know he wants to be, too, but
it can't be a competition

93
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,984
between he and I.
It will just hurt his emotions.

94
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,821
It will hurt the whole camp.
That's what beat us at the

95
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,698
challenge yesterday.
We weren't working together.

96
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,452
If we can keep this harmony up,
we will be a strong little

97
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,330
tribe.
Even though we're little, we

98
00:06:54,413 --> 00:07:06,175
are going to be mighty.
>> It was low tide early enough

99
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,554
in the morning, and I figured,
"Here's my shot.

100
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,682
I'm going to go get something
for breakfast."

101
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,350
I really want to get one of
these rays.

102
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,687
There are some enormous
stingrays out there.

103
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,648
And I saw a couple, but I
couldn't get to 'em in time.

104
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,317
I have no fins and it's very,
very difficult.

105
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,862
Never mind a spear that's as
blunt as you can imagine.

106
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:31,659
But I was determined to get some
good food and roast it.

107
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,912
You bring in a fish, you get
some smiles.

108
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:47,049
I eventually found a shark under
a ledge, and I wanted him.

109
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,053
So I said screw it.
Let the spears float.

110
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,598
Just look at it, just gauge the
situation.

111
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,517
Just kept thinking, "How am I
going to do this?

112
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:02,231
How am I going to do this?"
Screw it.

113
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,611
I'm not leaving the thing there.
I'm going home with food.

114
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,618
He starts thrashing.
Tight up against the rock.

115
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,162
As long as he was trying to stay
lodged in there and I didn't

116
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,373
move my hand, but wouldn't let
him go, I felt okay.

117
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,584
Kept breathing.
Going up, breathing, holding on,

118
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,420
breathing.
Trying to get enough energy to

119
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,924
think what I'm going to do.
So I grabbed my spear and

120
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,344
figured I'd try to get through
his belly.

121
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:48,945
(<i> gasps</i> )
I let the head part go for a

122
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:53,282
second and whomp-- shark bite!
And I poke him in the eye.

123
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,285
He takes another chunk deeper.
There was no way.

124
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,454
He was not letting go.
He was never letting go.

125
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,625
I spent the next-- I don't
know-- half hour like that,

126
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,961
trying to figure out what am I
going to do to get this thing

127
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,754
off?
So I swim, no fins, nothing,

128
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,757
just kind of backwards swimming
as close as I can to shore to

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,136
get onto a rock.
Get onto a rock and pound the

130
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,849
side of his head with a rock
until he lets go.

131
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:23,020
Yi-yi-yi-yi.
>> Oh, my God.

132
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,274
>> His teeth, right there.
He's got me.

133
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,818
Pull it.
I let go a little bit, he goes

134
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,822
whomp, for the second bite.
Bites in further and harder.

135
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,615
So what do I do?
I bite him.

136
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,660
>> Oh, my God! Richard!
>> Can you see the bite marks?

137
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,455
>> Is it possible to call
a gay man a stud?

138
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,792
I think you're a stud.
>> Yeah, you're a provider.

139
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,713
>> If you're going to
stay on my arm, it's like this.

140
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,673
>> No way anybody else
is catching fish like that.

141
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:56,637
Richard Hatch is a fishing god.
He bit a shark that bit him.

142
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,473
I mean, it's so...
It's like man versus nature.

143
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,976
It's so Hemingway-esque.
I love it.

144
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,186
>> He's impressive.
>> He's very impressive.

145
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,190
I mean, he may not be impressive
downstairs, but he's very

146
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:20,536
impressive in other ways.
(<i> Richard chuckling</i> )

147
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,830
>> You know, you're at
the point without food for

148
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,875
whatever it's been, seven days.
People are ready to eat.

149
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,046
I need to be the provider.
They are just loving me right

150
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,717
now and it's good.
He bit me-- I ate him.

151
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,389
Mm.
>> Oh, mama mia, we-a

152
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,019
having a-some a-good food.
>> I've reached my daily

153
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,021
limit of giving thanks to
Richard Hatch.

154
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,023
>> And they go on and on and on:
"Thanks, Richard, thanks,

155
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:53,527
Richard, thanks, Richard."
Little baby bye-byes, Richard,

156
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,112
real soon.

00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,359
>> We got to build...
>> Okay, hold on. Hold on.

163
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,946
"Dream it, design it, do it.
Remodel your home in just one

164
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,615
day."
How perfect.

165
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:43,285
>> Basically, it's a
contest to see who can build the

166
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,122
best home for themselves in a
24-hour period.

167
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,749
>> "Make it bigger,
stronger, better.

168
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,168
Creativity and structure come
into play.

169
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,254
These tools should come in
handy.

170
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,632
Use driftwood, palm or kelp.
Only four tribemates can

171
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,635
participate.
You can do it. We can help."

172
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,431
>> "Tomorrow you'll be
judged by a professional to keep

173
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,017
it fair from bush guide, a much
better night's sleep for the

174
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,770
winners will be dropped down
from the air."

175
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,315
Mattresses, mosquito nets.
Ours is going to be a

176
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,151
disaster, I can tell you that
right now.

177
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,154
>> Ah, now see? There we go.
We've got a good group...

178
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,990
>> You know what we need?
Take that tree out in the

179
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,200
middle...
No, the tree comes out in the

180
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,035
middle.
Why? Why? I'm taking it out.

181
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:29,498
>> After we fight, you will.
Sue, she's a hag from hell.

182
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,333
>> Where do I have a beam
in the middle of my house,

183
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,003
just sitting there?
>> You got it in every corner.

184
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,381
>> Yeah, connected to a wall.
>> How I made it to 48

185
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,342
without Sue Hawk leading me by
the hand is a mystery.

186
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,261
>> Tom...
>> You do your half,

187
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,346
I'll do my half thing.
>> The tree's coming down, Tom.

188
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,890
>> You can do it then.
>> I will.

189
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,558
>> I'll sit out if y'all
want me to.

190
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,019
>> No.
>> She's the bossiest

191
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,022
woman I've ever been around.
There ain't no doubt in my

192
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,692
mind, her elevator don't go to
the top floor.

193
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,154
>> Why you walking fast now?
>> Huh?

194
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,365
>> "First place reward
and key clue number two.

195
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,993
Second place only key clue
number two."

196
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,703
Only four people are allowed
to work on this though.

197
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,498
>> This is what I do.
>> Yeah, this is what you do.

198
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,042
>> You have to do this.
>> Yeah, this is your job.

199
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,212
>> I'm going to sit out.
Actually, it's not hard for me

200
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,547
to sit on the sideline and
bite my tongue, because just

201
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,716
in my head I just keep
repeating, "These are really

202
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,178
stupid people I'm with."
They are. They're so stupid.

203
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,056
I hope they don't get jacked off
of this challenge just to

204
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,391
bring them down a notch.
>> Who else is sitting out?

205
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,560
>> I'll sit out.
>> Amber's sitting out, okay.

206
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,729
>> You guys trust me
enough to give you guys a plan

207
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,564
and we go by it...
>> Yeah, you're a construction

208
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,149
worker.
>> ...and just do it and

209
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,109
don't...
>> This is all about you.

210
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,570
>> I'm in construction
and I love to build things if

211
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,322
I have tools.
I was right up and at it, and

212
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,491
I was pumped and I was, like,
"Yeah, this is for me.

213
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,285
This is my challenge.
We'll win this."

214
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:54,750
One foot.
How high do you want the floor

215
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,961
up?
>> A foot.

216
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,756
To be honest with you, I was
so into what we were doing.

217
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,592
>> Down a hair, Tom.
>> We had a basic floor

218
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,095
plan and then got going.
It clicked, and we never

219
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,139
slowed down.
>> We got to get a

220
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,267
creative aspect to this.
If you guys want to try to

221
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,228
make a deck there or
something, a flower garden...

222
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,439
>> When I signed up to
take part in the reward

223
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,402
challenge, I thought that I'd
be, being a big help to Boston

224
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,281
Rob and Big Tom, but the guys
delegated me to go work with

225
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,284
Alicia.
>> I didn't even try

226
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,244
to get in there on that one.
>> Yeah, this is...

227
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,787
>> I knew that was going to
happen.

228
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,789
>> That's the story of
my<i> Survivor</i> life, that, uh,

229
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,749
the big boys don't let me
play.

230
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,085
>> And we got five
foot and three quarter.

231
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,921
So that's got to come out.
Easy.

232
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,258
That's square right there.
>> In the beginning,

233
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,261
the flirting with Boston Rob
was complete strategy for me,

234
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,680
and on the other end, I
thought it was complete

235
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,016
strategy for him, too.
And I'll admit, when I saw him

236
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,435
building that shelter, he was
pretty hot building that

237
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,437
shelter.
He's good at doing what he

238
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,606
does.
It's getting much easier and

239
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:04,820
easier to flirt with Boston
Rob, for sure.

240
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:07,323
>> Alicia thinks she's
this architect for some Zen

241
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:13,162
company or something.
Her vision is about as deep

242
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:19,168
as... yeah, that's about how
deep it is.

243
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,170
Where's Cesternino?
>> You know what, he's

244
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,546
strolling.
I don't know.

245
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,716
>> Cesternino, I
think, is useless all around.

246
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,676
Seems like he's on a never-
ending coffee break.

247
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,512
>> Where have you been?
>> I went to go grab

248
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,181
something, but it was too
heavy to get it all the way

249
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,225
back.
Yeah, and then I got lost in

250
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,895
the jungle.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

251
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,814
disappear like that.
>> It gets frustrating

252
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,651
because Rob Cesternino does
the minimal to get by.

253
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,863
And you know what?
Everybody noticed it.

254
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,157
>> Want to go get more
rocks or you want to hammer...

255
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,159
>> You want to get more rocks.
>> Okay.

256
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,328
>> That heat is
excruciating, and I've been

257
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,830
making, like, 20 trips to get
those rocks here, so have at

258
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:10,552
it, sweetie pie.
>> I wonder what

259
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,513
they're planning on making.
I don't get the gist of it

260
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,723
from Rupert.
>> Just logs, that's

261
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,561
all I hear.
>> I'm a rehabber by

262
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,856
trade, and that's what I do is
work on houses, so I told my

263
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,401
tribe we're building a log
cabin.

264
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,861
We're going to dig down into
the sand a couple feet to add

265
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,280
to our height, so you walk
into it and you'll be able to

266
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,410
stand up.
That's what I want.

267
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,287
>> Personally, I don't
feel digging into the ground

268
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,290
is a good idea.
>> Okay.

269
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,085
So you want to build the thing
all out of the ground?

270
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,421
We need...
>> Yeah, I think it

271
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,382
makes more sense 'cause if we
get it moist, kind of

272
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,301
underground, we're totally...
>> Do we want to be an

273
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,762
eye-catcher, a pop, "Oh, my
God," or do we want to be like

274
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,557
everybody else?
>> Um, what I want is a

275
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,309
place I can actually sleep in.
Sounds to me like you're

276
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,937
really concerned about
something standing out, and I

277
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,732
love that, but...
>> None of them are

278
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,900
going to make a structure as
creative as ours.

279
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,445
They're going to make huts.
>> I hear you.

280
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,114
>> We're going to make a log
cabin.

281
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,158
>> Rupert's a complete control
freak.

282
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,827
He has to have everything his
way and he thinks he's the

283
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,289
only one who can do it right.
But you know what?

284
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,332
All we need is rain rushing
down the side of that hill

285
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,419
right into our shelter and
we're screwed.

286
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,379
The other thing is, it's
going to take longer to dig

287
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,758
three feet in the ground...
>> How do you have any idea?

288
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,468
I know what I can do.
I'm 40 years old.

289
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,387
I've done my ... for years.
I've built houses for 20 years.

290
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,347
>> I hear you.
Can we vote on it?

291
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,434
Does anyone else have any
concern?

292
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,193
>> Okay.
All right.

293
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,653
>> Then we should...
>> Then let's do it.

294
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,990
Let's just... do it.
Let's just do it.

295
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:57,326
>> Jerri and Rupert got
in a fight.

296
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,829
Perfect.
That's just what I wanted.

297
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,166
She had very valid points.
You know, I don't want to dig

298
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,211
down three feet, live under
the ground, but I'm not going

299
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,671
to say that 'cause if you piss
someone off, you know, you

300
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,468
could be going home.
>> We're going to make

301
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,011
the most amazing tree house
you've ever seen.

302
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,223
>> That's right.
>> As far as the, uh,

303
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:24,186
floor plan and building
scheme, we've got it up here.

304
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,648
We know it's all about
location, location, location.

305
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,691
>> Absolutely.
>> So, basically, we're

306
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,194
doing an elevated floor plan,
probably have a little balcony

307
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,988
out front, a kitchen area over
on the left...

308
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,533
>> A nap area down below.
And perhaps a little crow's

309
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,827
nest up top to just kind of go
up there and think and Zen

310
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,745
out.
>> Crow's nest, but as

311
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,580
we like to refer to it, The
Love Nest.

312
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,874
>> The Love Nest, indeed.
>> And when you've got

313
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,918
Richard Hatch on your team,
there's lots of love.

314
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,711
>> Oh, too much love.
>> Yeah.

315
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,880
>> Rock garden, swing, coconut
phone.

316
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,050
Um, what else is in a regular
house?

317
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,387
>> TV.
>> We're not making a TV.

318
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,224
Um...
>> There are six members of our

319
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,519
tribe 'cause we've never lost
anything, yet, so we had to sit

320
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,438
out two people.
And I happily sat out of that

321
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,858
one, 'cause that's a lot of
work.

322
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,735
So we've got Lex and, uh,
Colby building the shelter,

323
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,573
and Shii Ann and Jenna...
>> Ooh, it's hot.

324
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,285
>> Are "helping" build the
shelter.

325
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,579
(<i> chuckles</i> )
>> We've been writing some

326
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,582
creative things, but we thought
we'd just join you.

327
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,417
This is all nonstructural
stuff that I thought it would

328
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,420
be fun to add.
Rope ladder, a hammock, to

329
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:36,925
chisel our names or the Mogo
Mogo icon into it, um, a dumb

330
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,554
waiter, if we do a bi-level we
could have, like a pulley, um,

331
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:45,058
some sort of door or a rock
garden, um, a coconut phone

332
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,935
that would go from the top
floor to down, downstairs

333
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,104
phone.
This is all stuff if we have

334
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,772
time.
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,816
>> And, like, palm beds.
>> We'll see.

336
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,319
I mean, all those touches...
>> Yeah, that's all...

337
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,030
>> The most important
thing is the structure itself.

338
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,787
>> It was as if when we spoke,
they couldn't hear it.

339
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,789
They had, like, their
transmitters tuned to each

340
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,126
other only.
>> We have to build this

341
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,754
thing extra tough, just
because we got a 250-pound

342
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,174
shark-catching gay fisherman.
>> Shark, shark wrangler.

343
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:22,429
>> That's right.
(<i> hammering</i> )

344
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,349
>> There's a lot of
other factors that come into

345
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,685
my game that may not come into
anybody else's game.

346
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,647
I mean, people have family
that they know when this is

347
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,149
over that they're going to be
there, you know?

348
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:37,152
That's all a question mark for
me.

349
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:42,449
I have a lot to lose being here.
Like, my mom.

350
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,787
That's a constant issue with me.
I'm wondering if I should have

351
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,123
left again.
>> We need to make rope.

352
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,000
>> Yeah, I'll get to that.
I'm busy right now lashing

353
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,046
this thing down; I'm all busy.
>> She's had cancer for a long

354
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,882
time and she's not better, and
I'm just afraid that she might

355
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,677
pass away while I'm here.
>> I can't tell if I like the

356
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,679
front or the back better.
>> That's curb appeal, babe.

357
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:17,526
>> Yeah.
>> Oh, my God, you

358
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,028
guys, this is getting dangerous.
>> Can't see anymore.

359
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,114
>> Rupert's idea was a
little ambitious.

360
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,117
We ended up working all
through the night.

361
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,745
We were trying to nail nails in
the pitch black.

362
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,543
And then in the middle of the
night, Rupert had dug half the

363
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,879
trench and I saw this giant
tree trunk down there, and you

364
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:43,260
can't chop it out.
>> My God.

365
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,389
I could not believe the
stupidity.

366
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,225
We played strong, but we
played stupid, and that is

367
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:54,688
what infuriates me.
>> Not good.

368
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,025
>> I don't think they're going
to disqualify us if...

369
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,860
>> If you just want to
be done, then stop and be done

370
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:04,197
and let me do.
I have a hard time standing

371
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,867
back and listening to a bunch
of people say it's too much

372
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,287
work, it can't get done.
Everybody's a "can't do it."

373
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,707
Everybody, everybody.
All three of them.

374
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,375
>> What are we going to
do for beds?

375
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,294
They're going to want to see a
shelter that's got...

376
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,546
>> Of course, we'll
need beds in here, of course.

377
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,757
>> Well then, take
it as a bed, I mean, that's...

378
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,052
>> We've crumbled.
In a single day, we went from a

379
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,264
happy group of four working
together, to three people not

380
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:32,726
knowing what the hell's going
on and one going completely

381
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,606
mad.
This is Rupert gone mad.

382
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,456
>> Looks good, you guys.
>> Yeah, put the welcome mat

383
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,625
out.
>> PROBST: What's going on, Mogo

384
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,960
Mogo?
>> Hello.

385
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,755
>> How 'bout that curb appeal?
>> PROBST: It's nice, although

386
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,757
this is the guy you want to
impress.

387
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,009
>> Hi.
>> PROBST: Brought along with me

388
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,512
Raffa, licensed contractor,
expert in construction, right

389
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,556
here from Panama.
He's going to visit each camp

390
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,480
and he will decide who has the
best shelter, so, take a look.

391
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,608
>> Kitchen area, where we like
to hang out, have our fireside

392
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,487
chats.
>> This is our outdoor balcony.

393
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,448
>> Hop up there, Lex.
>> This is our balcony for...

394
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:33,829
>> That's the balcony.
>> You can have an ocean view.

395
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:40,001
(<i> rumbling and crackling</i> )
>> Raffa, he starts

396
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,962
going around the shelter and
the first thing he does is

397
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,047
start grabbing on to things
and jerking them trying to rip

398
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:48,343
them down.
I don't know that Raffa

399
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,220
realizes, we got to live in
this shelter.

400
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,307
(<i> talking over each other</i> )
>> Woo, baby!

401
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:58,186
>> Yeah, shake it.
>> Look at him, yeah,

402
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:05,193
going up on the ladder.
>> Oh, geez.

403
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,529
>> Well, we know Richard
Hatch can now lay on it and

404
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,408
walk on it.
>> Yeah, baby!

405
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,827
>> Sure enough, he got
his level out, and he actually

406
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,414
gave me one of those, "Mm."
And that's a compliment, coming

407
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,249
from Raffa.
>> What do you think of that,

408
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,001
huh?
>> PROBST: That looks good.

409
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,419
>> Whoo!
>> I think he likes it.

410
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,045
I think he loves it.
>> Yeah, so...

411
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,757
<i>Vamanos, vamanos.</i>
>> Thank you.

412
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,552
>><i> Mi casa, su casa.</i>
>> Thank you.

413
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,554
>> PROBST: No bribes.
>> No bri...

414
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:39,561
>> PROBST: He's past bribery.
What's going on, Chapera?

415
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,732
(<i> shouting</i> )
>> Get my remote, Jeff, and

416
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,359
let's watch something.
>> PROBST: I brought along

417
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,736
Raffa.
We'll take a tour.

418
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,863
>> Yeah?
>> PROBST: Location, yeah.

419
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,032
>> Okay.
>> Okay, I want to show him

420
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,783
something.
These are all undermined, dug

421
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,953
in and square.
>> You're not moving this.

422
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,915
>> These are three foot in
the ground, and that-- all this

423
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,918
is square.
>> JEFF:<i> Fuerte?</i>

424
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,587
>> Strong, it's strong.
>> Tell him to hop up on

425
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,756
the swing.
>> Come on, buddy.

426
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,425
It's not going anywhere.
Want to swing?

427
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,469
>> Thank you, thank you.
>> Whee!

428
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,429
>> That's okay.
>> All right!

429
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,224
>> We will persuade you.
>> Look at all these rocks.

430
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,061
This is like Zen. See this?
>> PROBST: Checkerboard.

431
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,063
I like it. You seen enough?
Good?<i> Vamanos?</i>

432
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,065
>> Yeah,<i> vamanos.</i>
>> PROBST: Okay, good.

433
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,858
Thanks, guys.
>> Thank you.

434
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,401
>> All right.
>> AMBER:<i> Muchas gracias.</i>

435
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,613
>> Thank you, Raffa...
>> Welcome to Chez Saboga.

436
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,615
The first thing you see is our
gutter system, where our rain

437
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,618
collects, so all our bamboo that
turns up give us water down into

438
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,622
our pan. Right?
So the water... yeah.

439
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:46,336
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
>> Esta tambien.

440
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,297
We have a little table, two beds
made.

441
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:54,469
All logs steady and sturdy.
He walked around, and everything

442
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:59,766
that was loose, he touched.
And I saw it in his face when we

443
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,270
walked down into the hut.
He didn't lie down.

444
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,982
Little footrest log.
I couldn't get it out of the

445
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:13,446
sand, so, it stays.
You could climb on this sucker.

446
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:20,829
Sturdy.
See, we want water to be able to

447
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,541
hit our bamboo, so there is
space in between the bamboo to

448
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,502
funnel down.
So, that way, we can get to our

449
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:31,047
water.
I'm trying like crazy to talk to

450
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,967
him.
He doesn't really have anything

451
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,927
to do with us.
And he's ready to go.

452
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,638
>> PROBST: If you receive a gift
from the sky and a clue to your

453
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,725
rice in your tree mail, it means
that Raffa thought you had the

454
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,852
best shelter.
If you receive only a clue in

455
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,896
your tree mail, it means he
thought you had the second best

456
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,357
shelter.
If you don't hear from us at

457
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,693
all, I hope it keeps you dry.
>> Thank you.

458
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:58,992
>> Thanks.
>> Thanks for coming.

459
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,081
>> Saboga?
Oh!

460
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,584
>> PROBST: You don't like...?
>> No, no, no.

461
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,711
>> PROBST: You would not want to
live here?

462
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,548
>> Oh, no way.
No.

463
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,550
>> He's shaking his head no.
>> This Saboga is very

464
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,552
dangerous.
>> PROBST: Dangerous?

465
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,554
>> Yeah, this is the
water, these are...

466
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:24,225
(<i> whistles</i> )... this.
(<i> everyone talking at once</i> )

467
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:29,939
>> And then I see him tell Jeff,
water go down in... bad.

468
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,193
>> I don't think he likes it.
>> I don't think he likes it,

469
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,277
either.
>> He doesn't.

470
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,363
>> PROBST: Our work is done.
Thank you.

471
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,115
Let's get out of here.
>> Okay.

472
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,536
>> PROBST: Raffa's made his
decision.

473
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,789
Make the drop of the
housewarming gift at...

474
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,834
(<i> engine buzzing</i> )
They're the winners.

475
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,765
>> Uh-oh.
>> It's a plane.

476
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,310
>> Oh, God, drop something, oh,
God, drop something.

477
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,774
Wait for...
Aw!

478
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,611
>> Come on, circle back.
>> It's all right.

479
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,114
Tomorrow's what really matters.
>> Sorry, guys.

480
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:23,159
It's totally my fault.
>> It's not your fault, Rupert.

481
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,460
>> Da plane! It's da plane!
Oh, God!

482
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,837
>> It's coming!
>> You know what?

483
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,839
>> Yeah, it's ours,
it's ours, it's ours!

484
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,467
Look! Dump it!
>> Yeah, here he comes.

485
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,972
(<i> shouting</i> )
>> Come on, now.

486
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,975
Come on, drop it.
>> Coming, coming, he's gonna

487
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:47,976
dump.
>> No way.

488
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,811
>> Yeah, it's ours, it's
ours, it's ours, look!

489
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,771
>> He's not over our beach, you
guys.

490
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,982
>> Yes, he is.
>> Yes, he is over our beach.

491
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,442
>> Yes, he is!
I think we got it.

492
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,652
>> And if we don't?
>> No, we don't. Yes, we do!

493
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,821
No...
>> Come on!

494
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:05,160
Right here! Drop it!
>> We're waiting for...

495
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,455
>> Oh, come on now.
(<i> cheering</i> )

496
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,458
>> Is that ours?
>> Is it ours, or is it theirs?

497
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:16,463
>> No, it's not.
(<i> cheering</i> )

498
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,639
>> It's theirs.
>> That's terrible.

499
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,894
That's such a bummer.
>> It better be a damn mansion.

500
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:38,860
It better have three stories.
(<i> cheering</i> )

501
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,988
>> We've never been so
excited in our lives.

502
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,658
That was just a pinnacle moment
for us since we've been here.

503
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,245
It was the happiest moment
ever... ever.

504
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,709
>> Oh, boy.
Oh, boy!

505
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,212
>> It's a mattress.
>> Oh, my God. Oh!

506
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,506
>> What's that, a tarp?
>> It's a tarp...

507
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,549
>> Oh, it's a tarp.
>> Oh, my God.

508
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,886
>> Pillows, pillows.
>> Blankets, oh, my God.

509
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:09,432
>> Wine!
(<i> cheering</i> )

510
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,434
Get that wine open.
Let's go.

511
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,436
You guys, we won first place.
>> Yeah.

512
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,562
>> Whoo!
>> All right?

513
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,565
>> Yeah, baby!
>> Give it up.

514
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,277
>> We wouldn't lose.
We haven't lost a thing yet.

515
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,406
The arm's up, so I'm assuming...
we have mail.

516
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,118
Yeah, baby.
Better be a clue.

517
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,372
I'm not waiting to open it.
Oh, it's a map.

518
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,083
And it's a clue, too.
Yeah, baby.

519
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,085
Clue two for rice.
That's so much more important

520
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,880
than anything else.
>> Drunk on day eight.

521
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,925
>> Oh, yeah, my chest is
all burning, and my stomach's

522
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,928
all burning...
>> Everything is all heavy.

523
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,056
>> Burning!
>> This is awesome.

524
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,058
>> I can't have too many
more of these sips.

525
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,269
>> Raffa never had so
much fun, going for a little

526
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,312
ride on the swing.
>> It was the swing...

527
00:30:56,396 --> 00:31:00,149
>> Sue?
>> Hey, man, I don't drink.

528
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,776
>> She doesn't drink.
>> Not at all.

529
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,778
>> That's too bad.
>> More for you!

530
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:07,782
>> That could be the best
thing I've heard from Sue.

531
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:16,499
(<i> all sighing</i> )
>> Have you felt these pillows?

532
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,501
They're a little rough.
>> I'm getting drunker

533
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:22,255
and drunker...
>> Oh, give me the canteen.

534
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,132
The wine hit Amber a little bit
strong.

535
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,801
She wanted to start kissing
me in front of everybody.

536
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,304
>> If you're going to kiss
me, kiss me now, because I'm not

537
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,847
kissing you with nasty breath
later on.

538
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,348
Now I got wine breath.
>> Whoa!

539
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,976
Here's the thing.
Amber and I have been flirting

540
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,145
with each other since we got out
here.

541
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,522
We have an alliance together.
She probably thinks she's

542
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,858
playing me.
I probably think I'm playing

543
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,277
her.
Who knows how it's going to turn

544
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,154
out.
One thing's for sure though--

545
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,406
there can only be one winner in
this game.

546
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:59,167
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )
>> Oh, no.

547
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,922
Cue the thunder.
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

548
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,371
>> Last night was an
absolute nightmare.

549
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,541
Just the queen mother of
all storms rolled through.

550
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:45,254
Our shelter was not really quite
prepared for that kind of storm,

551
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,424
and I can't imagine that any
shelter would be.

552
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,885
And you know, all of us kind of
dressed in our... well, all of

553
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:53,429
what we got, which is for must
of us just a pair of shorts and

554
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,891
a T-shirt or a tank top.
We were just...

555
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,060
I've never been so cold in my
life.

556
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,355
>> I'd get in the shelter.
You're in the rain.

557
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,565
So if I were you, I would sit up
there and, um...

558
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,860
I'm going to be under this.
Unless you want to stand here in

559
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,905
the rain.
What do you want to do?

560
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,796
>> I just want to let
you guys know that there's a lot

561
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:30,925
of things I thought I would be
able to overcome here-- just

562
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:35,054
missing family, missing home,
but my mom is really ill, and I

563
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,724
think I need to be with my
family.

564
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,892
I think family is the number one
thing right now.

565
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,478
And I think that they need me.
And as much as I don't want to

566
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,440
do it, it's a wise decision for
me to walk at this point in

567
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:50,153
time, so...
>> God, Jenna.

568
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,780
>> It frightens me that my mom--
something horrible might happen

569
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,742
to my mom while I'm here, and it
plagues me every day.

570
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,952
It follows me around like a dark
cloud.

571
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:01,289
And I don't think I'd ever
forgive myself if I knew that I

572
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,959
was here playing a game and
something happened to her.

573
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:11,299
>> Kathy, is she all right?
>> It's just too much for her.

574
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:16,012
Jenna was just a quivering,
shaking little leaf.

575
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,766
And she's finally collapsing.
Her mom is an a cancer rehab

576
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,977
home, and I didn't realize that.
She shouldn't be here actually,

577
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,647
in my opinion.
She should not be here.

578
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,857
And I just finally heard about
it.

579
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,984
She finally came up to me and
told me that, and I said, "You

580
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:32,987
know what, Jenna, you have every
right to be in the doldrums."

581
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:38,326
Every right.
>> Life is so short.

582
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:46,709
You blink and you're gone.
We're a tribe that has not

583
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,879
lost one challenge since
this game began.

584
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,799
And the reason for that is
because of output by all six

585
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,009
players.
Losing any one of those six

586
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,512
would be a detriment.
It would hurt a lot.

587
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,682
It would hurt morale, it would
hurt our performance.

588
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,644
You know, I don't even like to
think about the possibilities or

589
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,064
the what-if scenarios if Jenna
exits.

590
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,359
>> You're a good person.
And you won this sucker, man.

591
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,319
>> It's all good.
>> The thing is, you need

592
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,155
to know something, because this
is real.

593
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,658
It's becoming a bit of a cancer
eating away at us.

594
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,369
And so that's why, if you can
just hold that down to help us

595
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,831
out, because we need more
positive attitudes right now.

596
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,917
>> I completely agree with you.
>> We totally know what

597
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,088
you're going through, but let's
just wait to see what happens.

598
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,643
>> PROBST: Getting your first
look at the new Saboga tribe.

599
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,020
Rudy voted out at the last
Tribal Council.

600
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,856
>> Oh, my Rudy.
>> PROBST: He's gone, Richard.

601
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:55,403
First things first.
Give it up, Kathy.

602
00:35:55,486 --> 00:36:00,783
Mariano.
Once again, immunity back up for

603
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,537
grabs.
So nine days in.

604
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,831
Starting to get into it now.
You guys have a lot of bug

605
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,541
bites.
How are you holding up, Jenna?

606
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,418
>> Bitten.
That's about the worst of it.

607
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,919
>> PROBST: Emotionally though,
all right?

608
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,588
>> Oh yeah,
emotionally we feel pretty good.

609
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,923
Plenty of water, plenty of food.
Shelter's working out pretty

610
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,758
good.
>> PROBST: How about you,

611
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,218
Chapera?
Amber, how you doing?

612
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,554
>> The bugs like me,
but it's all right.

613
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,389
>> PROBST: What's going on with
Mogo Mogo?

614
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,225
>> We got a couple of issues.
A couple of emotional things

615
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,645
going on.
>> PROBST: What's going on?

616
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,272
>> Okay.
(<i> crying</i> )

617
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,608
Wait.
Due to...

618
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:39,238
someone who's very ill
at home right now that's getting

619
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:45,036
worse, I need to pull myself out
of the game and be there.

620
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:57,840
I love this game so much, but my
priority is my family...

621
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:02,511
and it just doesn't make any
sense for me to be here anymore.

622
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,264
So I need to take myself out of
the game.

623
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,267
>> PROBST: So, are you talking
about your mom?

624
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,979
>> Yeah. Yeah.
She's just not any better and...

625
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:16,192
things have gotten a little
worse... quickly.

626
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,361
>> PROBST: You're talking as
though you're getting

627
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,988
information, updates on your
mom, in the last nine days.

628
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,491
>> No, it's just she's my
mother and I'm the only child.

629
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,826
I got a vibe.
I got a feeling that she needs

630
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,329
me there.
My dad needs me there.

631
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:32,124
Everybody needs me there.
I made a bad judgment call.

632
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,169
I shouldn't have came.
I thought that I could do it

633
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:38,673
and she would want me to and I,
I was wrong.

634
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,384
I should be there in case
something happens.

635
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,178
I'll never forgive myself.
You got to weigh out your

636
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,763
options.
I love this game, but it's, it's

637
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,390
my family.
>> PROBST: Alicia, what are you

638
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,350
thinking?
>> I think family's the

639
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,851
most important thing in the
world.

640
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,020
There's nothing you can ever put
above family.

641
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,522
I wouldn't have come out here to
begin with.

642
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:58,025
No matter whether my mother
said, "I want you to go," I

643
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,028
would have never came, ever.
>> Jenna admits her mistake.

644
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,571
Everybody makes it.
She admits her mistake.

645
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,657
>> But I wouldn't have,
I wouldn't have come.

646
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,910
>> PROBST: How about you, Amber?
>> (<i> crying</i> )

647
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,414
I feel really bad for her.
Can I give her a hug?

648
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:15,209
>> PROBST: Of course.
>> Thank you.

649
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,920
>> I hope it works out.
>> This is the last thing

650
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,422
I wanted to do.
It really is.

651
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,508
I really wanted to play this
game, and I give all these

652
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,094
people more credit than ever,
'cause it's hard.

653
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,054
>> PROBST: So that's one of my
questions.

654
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,724
I just want to understand
exactly why you're leaving.

655
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,851
If you're leaving 'cause you
can't handle it...

656
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,979
>> No. I can handle it.
I handled it last time.

657
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,023
This is time I need with my
mother.

658
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,067
I need to be there sitting
by her bed, whether she's awake

659
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,945
or not.
I need to know that I had this

660
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,782
time with her while I could.
>> PROBST: Boston Rob.

661
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,910
>> Well, I don't think
it's right to even question her

662
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,579
motives.
We don't know what she's

663
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,291
thinking or how she's feeling.
I'm not one to get emotional,

664
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,878
and I know inside right now, I
feel butterflies.

665
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:04,425
So I say we just support her
decision and go from here.

666
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,763
>> PROBST: Rupert.
>> I feel bad for her,

667
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:13,476
but, you know...
to quit-- it's hard.

668
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:18,439
It's a hard decision.
>> Before I left, I told my

669
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:22,109
family, I made a commitment,
I was coming here, not staying

670
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,112
home.
If y'all got killed in a car

671
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,949
wreck, don't call me.
I'll be there after it's over,

672
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,119
but, now, I made that decision
for Big Tom.

673
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,955
And a lot of people are
different than Big Tom.

674
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,792
>> PROBST: You know, we all have
different values we place on

675
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,294
different things.
And I, I don't get the sense

676
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:43,422
that anybody here is saying,
"I'm right, she's wrong."

677
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,258
But you guys<i> are</i> being pretty
honest in saying, "Here's what I

678
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,803
would have done."
This is a big action with big

679
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,555
consequences.
And it could have a big impact

680
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,100
on this game.
We had an immunity challenge

681
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,311
that we don't need to run now.
Chapera, Saboga, you get off

682
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,522
easy, in a sense.
You get a free pass today.

683
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,525
Nothing at stake.
You're going back to camp.

684
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,528
Mogo Mogo, from a game point of
view, it hurts you.

685
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,697
This is a game about numbers.
You only have six to begin with.

686
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,492
You are now down to five.
That increases your chances of

687
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,702
being voted out at the next
Tribal Council.

688
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,330
We won't run the immunity
challenge.

689
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:20,668
We won't have an official Tribal
Council, but we do have the

690
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,963
formality of you going home.
Can you make it to Tribal

691
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:24,797
Council?
>> No.

692
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,925
I can't.
I'm sorry.

693
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:32,555
I've pushed too far.
I don't think I can do it.

694
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,934

Next time on<i> Survivor,</i> Rob and

>> You're so warm.
>> Boston Rob and Amber

704
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,483
are gonna do it.

705
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,319
havoc.
>> It's not worth it.

706
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,488

gets physical.

707

>> PROBST: Ethan throws it on
Colby.

708
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:05,624
>> Damn it!
>> When Jenna announced

709
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,086
that she was going home, there
was this mood that swung through

710
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,047
everybody and everybody's
shoulders went down and their

711
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,301
head hung low and it all brought
back the reality that it's

712
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,470
difficult out here, and even
though it's a game, there's a

713
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,473
whole lot more happening here.
