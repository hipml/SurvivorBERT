00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
Luke- Come on in, welcome to Idle Down where we talk all things Survivor.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,380
My name is Luke and today we're talking about Survivor's most iconic finale episodes.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,600
The finale.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,220
It's the culmination of the season you've been watching up to this point.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,920
The season's winner is crowned, maybe a favorite comes up just short, legends are

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,980
made and million dollar checks are handed out.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,160
Survivor has had more good finales than not and even underwhelming seasons can really

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,040
come together in the last act.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,720
I mean it is one of the fundamentals of storytelling, you know, sticking the landing.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,240
For me, five Survivor finales stand out as the most iconic ever, representing a cross

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,660
section of eras and even season quality.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,300
These are the finales that stuck with fans forever.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,780
It was hard to narrow it down to five, so probably one or two of your favorites didn't

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,440
make it in, but I tried to be as objective as possible here.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,020
Nevertheless, some tough cuts were made.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,520
At the start of this season I looked at Survivor's most iconic premieres, now let's take a look

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,180
at the most iconic finales in Survivor history.

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,880
At number five is the finale of Survivor, Ghost Island.

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,260
I know, I know, this isn't a well regarded season, but Ghost Island's shocking tie

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,900
vote between Wendell and Dom earns this finale a spot on this list all its own.

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,800
This finale completely retextualized the entire season.

22
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:44,660
Most of Ghost Island is an inevitable frogmarch to an expected Wendell or Dom victory, as

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,020
Naviti, Naviti Strongs the Malolos out of the game.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,940
Only turning the cannons on the Naviti Power players when it's too late.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,560
The writing was on the wall before, but once Kellan goes, the only players with any win

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,280
equity at all are Wendell and Dom, and the only question left in the season is which

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,120
of the two of them will win the crown.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,720
The answer is…

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,960
well, both at first.

30
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,480
Few things on Survivor have shocked audiences as much as Jeff announcing he'll be reading

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,900
the final tribal votes live on location, something he hadn't done since season one.

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,040
With the final vote a tie, five for Wendell and five for Dom, the season's entire narrative

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,500
suddenly clicks into place, and all the time spent building these two up as twin powerhouse

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,120
forces in the game, at the expense of screen time for everyone else, suddenly made perfect

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,700
sense.

36
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,360
Ghost Island's unprecedented tie vote proved that Survivor still had new ground to trod

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,800
deep into the 30s, as two guys who both deserved to win tied in a truly jaw-dropping moment,

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,220
and Laurel was demoted from finalist to juror and cast the winning vote for Wendell.

39
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,440
Finally, we got to see Laurel's big move she was talking about all season.

40
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,380
It just happened to be her moving from her finalist seat to the voting booth.

41
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,480
At number four is the finale of Survivor, David vs Goliath.

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,140
This is one of the funniest episodes of Survivor of all time, and it's all thanks to the

43
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,200
episode's MVP, Angelina…

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,280
Zladder.

45
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,360
There's a reason they brought this bad boy back as a tribe captain in Survivor 45.

46
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,480
Angelina's insistence that she nearly died climbing a 50-foot ladder to retrieve an idol

47
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,200
when this thing has…

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,420
one, two, three…

49
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,280
only eight rungs is some of the most unintentionally

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,900
hilarious stuff I've ever seen on this or any show.

51
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,600
As they were all season, the stars of the finale truly are Angelina and Mike White,

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,140
with Angelina's antics dialed up to 11, particularly her insistence that she trick

53
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,460
Allison into playing a fake idol…

54
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,700
only to embarrass her.

55
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,160
There was no strategic value here.

56
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,840
Plus Mike's drunken scrambling for the idol clue on the final six reward.

57
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,440
Wineglass in hand is the ultimate mood.

58
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,460
Add on to that an incredible three immunity run from Underdog Nick, who was super-rude-able,

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,060
and I cannot stress this enough, only at the time, not now, and you've got a finale full

60
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,200
humor, an incredible and unique group of finalists, and a conclusion that paid off the season's

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,380
theme big time, as David ultimately slew Goliath.

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,480
The only thing that could have made it better is if the jury actually got this vote right.

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,040
Clearly the most deserving person did not win this season.

64
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,320
I mean, Angelina gave up rice for the tribe, then climbed a 50-foot ladder to retrieve

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,620
an idol all without a jacket.

66
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,320
At number three is the finale of Survivor Heroes vs.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,020
Villains.

68
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,580
Unsurprisingly, the greatest season of reality TV also has an incredible finale.

69
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,360
This episode comes out of the gate hard.

70
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,160
Colby's final five elimination is expected, but for my money, still remains one of the

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
most poignant ever.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,880
The entire season went out of its way to dunk on him and portray him as this over-the-hill

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,420
cowboy who simply can't compete anymore, which is even funnier when you consider that

74
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,100
Colby was only 35 when this season filmed.

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,880
But his final confessional, where he says he'll never quit fighting in the game, is

76
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,300
a genuinely moving sendoff to a legend.

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,660
And the decision to hold on that pregnant pause as Colby gets choked up on the weight

78
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,260
of his own words is one of the most inspired editing moments ever on this show.

79
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,480
As if that wasn't enough, Sandra and Russell are both firing on all cylinders here.

80
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:01,840
After two seasons of back-to-back 39-day runs on Survivor, Russell has fully descended into

81
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,500
insanity and delusion.

82
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,660
Practically every other word out of his mouth is about how easy Sandra will be to beat.

83
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,200
And Sandra's dropped whatever tiny pretense she has of kowtowing to Russell.

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,800
She even brings his story full circle, from burning Jason's socks at the start of Samoa

85
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
to her burning his hat before they head to Final Tribal.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,800
It was an exciting finale where it truly felt like any non-Russell player could pull out

87
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,320
the win.

88
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,600
Final Tribal was passionate, and fans still debate to this day if Sandra or Parvati should

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,140
have won.

90
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,240
But for me, a worthy winner was crowned, with the hero-laden jury rejecting Russell's mean-spirited

91
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,440
gameplay for the second time, simultaneously punishing Parvati for enabling it.

92
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,080
Look, you can actually pinpoint the moment his heart breaks in half.

93
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,440
And here.

94
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,160
At number two is the finale of Survivor, Palau.

95
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,560
Survivors rarely examined the real sorts of complex emotions and tumultuous highs and

96
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,480
lows that come when you make real friends in a game designed around betrayal.

97
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,900
But they did just that with Tom, Katie, and Ian.

98
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,900
A trio that dominated the game top to bottom.

99
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,860
By the time the finale rolls around, Ian is torn by his earlier promise to go to the end

100
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,280
with Tom, by far the best competitor in the game.

101
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,600
He gets caught up in subtle misstatements about his twin loyalties regarding his endgame

102
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,820
plans with Tom and Katie.

103
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,300
I think watching Ian reckon with the emotional toll the game is taking on him is endlessly

104
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,040
fascinating.

105
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,600
And much of the finale revolves around that.

106
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,260
It almost seems like he feels that he's truly lost sight of his morals and his character

107
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,920
while playing the game, that part of his very soul has been corroded.

108
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,140
I didn't come out here to play the villain.

109
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,740
I didn't come out here to be the backstab ready.

110
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,040
Especially those two.

111
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,020
Obviously, the 12-hour long endurance challenge between Tom and Ian is the highlight of the

112
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,980
episode, and the shocking decision by Ian to voluntarily step down so that Tom can take

113
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,560
Katie to the end over him, rejecting the money in exchange for his dignity, was the ultimate

114
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,800
water cooler moment.

115
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,300
It holds a mirror up to the audience.

116
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,480
What is your integrity worth?

117
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,020
Ian's such a fascinating character in Survivor lore to me because you have a guy whose brain

118
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,900
knows what the right moves are, but his heart gets in the way.

119
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,360
Now, the season is over the second Ian steps off the perch because no one in their right

120
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,660
mind would ever vote for Katie to win over Tom, so I guess you could offer a tepid argument

121
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,700
that this finale climaxes a little early.

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,140
Which if you ask this guy, that isn't so bad.

123
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,860
The fact is, Survivor at its best can actually say something about the human condition, and

124
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,920
the Palau finale has a lot to say.

125
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,060
The other side of that is that Survivor at its best also includes Lacey falling on her

126
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,040
face in a puzzle challenge.

127
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,120
The duality of man.

128
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:25,320
The most iconic finale in Survivor history is the finale of Survivor's original season,

129
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,440
Survivor Borneo.

130
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,540
The numbers don't lie, over 50 million people tuned in to see which of the Toggi 4 would

131
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,860
win the game.

132
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,900
Ok, I mean the finale of Australia isn't on this list and like 35 million people tuned

133
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,880
in to that, but that one is boring as shit.

134
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,040
It's easy to forget that this final four was the alliance everyone at home hated, and

135
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,300
Richard was the most objectionable player of them all.

136
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,760
With the benefit of hindsight, Rich's game here is so fun to watch, especially here in

137
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,440
the end game.

138
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,020
conniving, egotistical, and ruthless, Rich was one of the few people this season to see

139
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,380
the game of Survivor for what it is.

140
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,780
A game.

141
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,120
And the depth of his understanding of the game he was playing is on full force in this

142
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,360
episode, culminating in his throwing of the final three challenge, understanding that

143
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,380
Kelly winning immunity was his only winning path, and by forcing her to be the bad guy

144
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,100
and vote off Rudy, he was practically guaranteeing his win.

145
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,660
As a side note, Jeff even offers them some orange slices to tempt them out of the challenge.

146
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,160
Jeff, what is this?

147
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,020
The new era?

148
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,900
Of course, the centerpiece of this finale is the final Tribal Council, and it's shocking

149
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,920
how much of the show gets right on its first time.

150
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,600
Much of the final Tribal format went unchanged for over a decade and a half, proving that

151
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,260
the show had a winning formula right out of the gate.

152
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,700
But it's Sue's Snakes and Rats speech that vaulted this into legendary status.

153
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,880
Two decades later, through a flood of imitators, no one's delivered a speech this biting and

154
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,120
impassioned at final Tribal ever again.

155
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,100
In fact, in the realm of Survivor stump speeches, the returns would be rather diminishing.

156
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,760
You've really got to appreciate the way the stars aligned on this whole thing.

157
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,920
Speeches weren't even going to be a thing until Sue was asked by Mark Burnett what she

158
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,160
intended to ask the final two.

159
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,920
And Sue being Sue said she had nothing to ask them, only something to say.

160
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,640
With that spark, Burnett immediately restructured final Tribal Council to allow for speeches

161
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,500
and statements.

162
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,460
That a woman who frequently stumbled over her words in confessional and who couldn't

163
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,860
