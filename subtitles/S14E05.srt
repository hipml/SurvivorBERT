4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,587
insane.

sentimental and sensitive.

9
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,052
You're a man.

10
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:11,386
Act like one.

game, they're going to have push

13
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,181
me off, because there's no way

14
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,934

>> From the beginning, there has

20
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,360
been a bond between Boo, Alex,

21
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,654
Edgar, myself, and Stacy.

22
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,864
All we know is that the five of

(<i> cheering</i> )

>> What happened?

39
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,092
>> We lost, bro!

40
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:51,926
What do you mean, "What

41
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,719
happened?"

42
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,595
>> PROBST: Yau-Man was sent to

43
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,722
Exile Island, where he learned

44
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,766
the idol was back at camp.

00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,308

highest point of the big cave."

47
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,771
I'm quite sure I know where the

48
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,647
idol is.

49
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,024
>> I can't function like this.

first blow...

52
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,526
>> All right, Gary, I'm going to

53
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,569
call in the medical boat now and

54
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,487
get you out of here.

55
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,279
>> PROBST: ...when Gary was

56
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,948
forced to leave the game.

57
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,116
At the immunity challenge...

58
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,700
Ravu has a lot of time to make

59
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,326
up.

60
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,286
...Ravu could not change their

61
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,079
luck, and Moto once again

62
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,372
claimed victory.

63
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,583
Motto wins immunity, still

64
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,251
undefeated!

65
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,628
But a message in a bottle left

66
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,129
Moto with a dilemma.

67
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,547
>> "You must now decide which is

68
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,090
more important to you."

69
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:31,674
>> PROBST: Moto had to choose

70
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,635
between giving up immunity or

71
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,428
their camp of comfort.

72
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,221
>> Jeff, we're keeping our

73
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:36,805
comfort and going to tribal

74
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,306
council.

75
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,140
>> PROBST: Back at camp, the

76
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,976
alliance of five solidified.

77
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,894
>> We need to put in our votes

78
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,103
and make a decision.

79
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,021
>> I vote Liliana.

80
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,689
>> I vote Liliana too.

81
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,149
>> PROBST: At tribal council...

82
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,442
Fourth person voted out of

83
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,527
<i>Survivor: Fiji...</i>

84
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,402
>> Wow.

85
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,153
>> PROBST: ...Liliana was blind-

86
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:52,362
sided.

87
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,365
Liliana, the tribe has spoken.

88
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,826
14 are left.

89
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:21,224
Who will be voted out tonight?

90
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,017
>> You guys like it well-done,

91
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,646
right?

92
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,399
Medium-well, all right.

93
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,525
I just came back from Exile

94
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,027
Island.

95
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,071
The clues to the whereabouts of

96
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,239
the immunity idol definitely

97
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,242
points to the fact that it's in

98
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,037
our tribal camp area.

99
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,039
In fact, it's very specific that

100
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,125
it is at the threshold of our

101
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,502
cave, where we are sleeping.

102
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,795
It's very frustrating.

103
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,088
I sort of know where it is, and

104
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,758
I don't know how to get to it.

105
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,510
>> Earl is the only other person

106
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:16,404
who has been to Exile Island.

107
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,239
>> He knows that I know where it

108
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:22,118
is sort of, and I know he knows

109
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,244
sort of where it is.

110
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,871
So maybe at some point, we can

111
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,997
join forces in finding this

112
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,082
idol.

113
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,301
>> He has all the clues, and I

114
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,761
only have a couple, but he's

115
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,846
going to need my help.

116
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,893
>> I like Yau.

117
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,144
I just want to build that trust

118
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,228
with him, okay?

119
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:49,729
"Yau, you can trust me.

120
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,397
I have your back."

121
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,357
Just when it comes down to it,

122
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,775
me just helping him get the idol

123
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,486
is just a good move.

124
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:09,874
(<i> theme song playing</i> )

125
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,727
>> We're struggling right now,

126
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,231
and all of us are starving.

127
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,232
The other camp, they have a

128
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,441
shelter, a king-sized mattress,

129
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,778
tons of food, fishing gear.

130
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,029
We're still sleeping on palm

131
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,446
fronds.

132
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,949
We at least got a good water

133
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,909
system going.

134
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:49,747
And that's about it.

135
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,040
>> Yau-Man and I had a little

136
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,834
chat about the idol.

137
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,503
I mean, he has an idea where it

138
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,588
might be, but there's no way for

139
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,132
him to look for it when people

140
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,009
are there, because the idol is

141
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,593
actually in our little cave.

142
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,803
So we got to get people out of

143
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,888
there.

144
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,056
It's time to go hunting for

145
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,685
crab-- crab, snails, anything

146
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,771
you see-- if you want to eat.

147
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,580
>> I'm very excited.

148
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,873
I got a chance to dig, I don't

149
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,207
know for how long.

150
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,375
The problem is I don't know when

151
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,461
they will show up.

152
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,338
I know it's along the threshold

153
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:39,964
somewhere, right at the entrance

154
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,841
of the cave.

155
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:42,425
So logically, if that's true,

156
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,385
then it would be right

157
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,430
underneath here.

158
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:00,860
The problem is the clue

159
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:05,782
definitely says, "Dig deep."

160
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,699
That's the question, how deep do

161
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,076
I have to go?

162
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,160
And with a machete, it's not

163
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,996
easy to dig deep.

164
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:25,927
>> I took the whole camp out to

165
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,762
give Yau a chance to dig for

166
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,306
that immunity idol.

167
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:30,932
Hopefully, he goes with what I'm

168
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,227
trying to do.

169
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,814
Now, look at that.

170
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,150
That's what I'm talking about.

171
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,656
>> Earl and I decided we were

172
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,990
going to hike up, see if we

173
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:48,574
could find some more fruit or

174
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,077
anything edible.

175
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,829
And I tell you, we got up to the

176
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,705
hill, where you can see 360

177
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,417
degrees, all around the island.

178
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,752
We so rarely get a chance to

179
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,505
just take it in and just let

180
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,298
ourselves be astounded and awed

181
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,425
by what's around us.

182
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,552
It gives you new drive to keep

183
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,763
going.

184
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,223
In a battle of wills, which this

185
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,308
game is, you need every little

186
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,227
ounce of energy you can get to

187
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,562
keep you just emotionally going

188
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,939
forward.

189
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,992
>> The search for the immunity

190
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,619
idol is not going very well.

191
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,955
Trying to dig with that machete

192
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,041
is quite difficult-- to dig

193
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,960
deep, at least.

194
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,003
At this point, it's going to be

195
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,088
very difficult to get it.

196
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,895
>> Tree mail.

197
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,688
>> Time to go get our reward,

198
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,689

199
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,524
streak.

200
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,693
>> Oh, pictures.

201
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,611
>> "Pick two choices for your

202
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,155

203
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,406
You win, you'll take it all.

204
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,574

206
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,578
Toiletries-- I saw toiletries!

207
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,871
>> Wine, cheese.

208
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,705
>> Oh, yeah, that one!

209
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,790
>> Oh!

210
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,834

00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,752

212
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,754
>> The toiletries.

213
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,379
>> Are you going to change your

214
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,339
vote?

215
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:26,923
>> We keep getting more food,

216
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,633
more nourishment.

217
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,634
Ravu keeps getting less.

218
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,761
They're wasting away.

219
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,803
But we have the luxury of them

220
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,680
being down and malnourished and

221
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,682
us being fat and happy.

222
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,975
Who cares how much luxury?

223
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,976
We have so much luxury, it

224
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,898
doesn't matter.

225
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,234
>> I want the chocolate cake.

226
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,193
Can we please pick one thing

227
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:47,860
that we need and one thing we

228
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,569
want?

229
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,779
>> Yeah, one thing that we need

230
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,447
and something we can eat.

231
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,783
>> Two things we need, that'd be

232
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,451
the best thing, two things that

233
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:55,660
we need.

234
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,788
>> I'm starving.

235
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,122
>> Okay, we definitely want...

236
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,332
that's why we want fishing gear,

237
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,167
to catch fish.

238
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,252
We're not on Fantasy Island.

239
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,211
I don't want wine and cheese.

240
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,545
That doesn't do anything for me.

241
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,171
Moto is living in a mansion over

242
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,589

243
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,007
<i>Prince of Bel Air</i> over there.

244
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,384

<i>Times.</i>

246
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,135
You know, we're going to be

247
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,095
practical.

248
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,137
They should have put a couple of

249
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,389
Philly cheese steaks on there.

250
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:16,973
>> Don't start with the food

251
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:22,562

Moto, come on in!

Boo, can't help but notice that

255
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,250
you're coming in here chewing

256
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:44,834
on... what was that, mango?

257
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,794
>> Yes, sir.

258
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:47,378
>> PROBST: Rocky, it's got to

259
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,171
burn a little bit.

260
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,298
>> I mean, look at my eyes.

261
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:50,965
There's fire coming out right

262
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,717
now.

263
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,968
Laugh it up.

264
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,677
It's all right.

265
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,637
We'll see what happens.

one on one on a platform.

273

Using large, padded bags, you

will battle sumo-style.

275
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,319
Your goal: knock the other tribe

276
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,487
member off the platform, into

277
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,822
the mud.

278
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,198
Winner scores a point for their

First tribe to seven wins

The winning tribe will send one

Let's get to the reward.

286
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,710
Ravu, you chose necessity, the

287
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,795
same fishing gear that Moto has

288
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,880
two sets of and a pot full of

Life is so good for Moto, they

293
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,807
chose more luxury: coffee and

294
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,725
some toiletries.

295
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,854
Winner takes it all.

Bring it, bro.

>> PROBST: Moto leads six-zip.

382
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,635
We're down to the last two tribe

383
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,512
members in this round.

384
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,137
We have Yau-Man now squaring off

385
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,056
against Stacy.

386
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,932
>> Bulldoze him!

387
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,016
>> PROBST: Moto leads six-zip.

388
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,769
Stacy wins here, it's over.

389
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,481
Survivors ready?

390
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,317
Go.

391
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,277
>> Go, Stacy, go!

392
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,820
Go, Stacy, go!

393
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,863
>> Push, Stacy, push!

394
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,156
>> Come on, Stacy!

395
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,912
(<i> cheering</i> )

396
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,332
>> PROBST: Stacy in the water!

397
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,377
Ravu scores their first point.

398
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,419
>> That a boy, Yau.

399
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,924
>> Yeah, Yau.

400
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:06,804
>> Do what you got to do.

401
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,930
>> PROBST: Here's where we

402
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,099
stand: Moto leads 6-1.

403
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,476
This is a grudge match,

404
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,686
Cassandra taking on Rita once

405
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,019
again.

406
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,105
Cassandra could win it for Moto

407
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,481
right here.

408
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:22,069
Survivors ready?

409
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,614
Go.

410
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,866
A hard push and a big fall for

411
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,243
Rita.

412
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:33,914
Moto wins reward!

413
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,124
Moto, you will now send one

414
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,751
person from the Ravu tribe to

415
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,961
Exile Island.

416
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,129
Who's it going to be?

417
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:40,337
>> Earl.

418
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,922
>> PROBST: Earl, you will return

419
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,132
in time for the next immunity

420
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,717
challenge.

421
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,763
Straight out this way, Earl.

422
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,265
Ravu, once again I got nothing

423
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:51,932
for you.

424
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,100
Moto, congratulations on another

425
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,144
win.

426
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,563
Fishing gear, potatoes,

427
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,064
toiletries, coffee, it's all

428
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,065
yours.

429
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,568
Head on back.

430
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,418
>> Oh, my god!

431
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,794
I love coffee.

432
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,503
>> This is clean.

433
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,796
I have not smelled anything

434
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,131
clean in a long, long time.

435
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,674
>> Let's make coffee.

436
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,216
Let's make coffee.

437
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,634
Let's make coffee.

438
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,801
Let's make coffee now.

439
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,928
>> Oh!

440
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,971
That challenge was a winner-

441
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:31,388
take-all situation.

442
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,140
Either we were going to get

443
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,516
coffee, toiletries, bag of

444
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,310
potatoes, and yet again the

445
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,811
fishing gear, or we were going

446
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,896
to lose it all and potentially

447
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:39,355
lose our advantage.

448
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,649
So it was a big deal.

449
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,108
>> Coffee.

450
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:48,572
Aw, they even gave us floss.

451
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,281
That's all right.

452
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,783
Y'all ain't got to talk to me.

453
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,825
It's cool.

454
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,619
>> Dreamz and Cassandra have no

455
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,870
allies on this team.

456
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:55,829
It's 5-2.

457
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,497
They're going to get picked off.

458
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,206
They know it.

459
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,457
They're getting paranoid.

460
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,458
It's not my problem.

461
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,459
We're all adults here.

462
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,585
There's no children.

463
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,503
I mean, come on.

464
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,924
It's<i> Survivor.</i>

465
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:07,800
>> This ain't the instant

466
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,134
dissolve coffee.

467
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,097
It's one you got to filter.

468
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,391
But it's so good.

469
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,310
(<i> spitting</i> )

470
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,311
>> What's going on, Boo... I

471
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,562
mean Dreamz?

472
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,106
You put the boiling water in

473
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,607
there with the coffee.

474
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,235
Yeah, you don't....

475
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,113
>> Do you know how to make it,

476
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,408
man?

477
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,450
>> Well, if you guys know how to

478
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,159
make it, tell him how to make

479
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,494
it.

480
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,246
>> That's cool.

481
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,916
Y'all can say that to my face,

482
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:41,625
you know, whatever y'all are

483
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,086
saying back there.

484
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,045
>> Stacy and Lisi I think, in

485
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,131
particular, are just downright

486
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,298
rude.

487
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,717
It kind of nauseates me to see

488
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,926
people being treated that way.

489
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,552
It really kind of just rubbed me

490
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,595
the wrong way.

491
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,304
Well, I don't know how to

492
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:54,930
freaking use it, so if someone

493
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:55,889
can tell me...

494
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,724
>> You have to boil water.

495
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,516
You put the coffee in the

496
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,892
bottom, you pour the boiling

497
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,518
water on top, and you let it sit

498
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,395
for about three minute, and then

499
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,646
you press it down, and then you

500
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,025
have coffee, simple as that.

501
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,609
>> This game to me is about

502
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,738
almost immediate karma, and why

503
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,822
they would treat other human

504
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,365
beings that way just as human

505
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,616
beings, and in the course of the

506
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,242
game, why they wouldn't see how

507
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,952
that might screw them in the

508
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,245
future.

509
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,084
>> Oh, my God, this is like a

510
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,795
little piece of heaven.

511
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,848
>> I'm really upset at Stacy and

512
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,683
Lisi, because they're on a power

513
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,769
trip, and if they're in my

514
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,895
alliance and they keep going

515
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:43,979
that way, I'm going to make sure

516
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,564
they're out.

517
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,565
>> This is, like, the best day

518
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,650
so far.

519
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,491
>> Oh, yeah.

520
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,241
>> Yau's been to Exile Island,

521
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,452
so him and I have an

522
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,161
understanding.

523
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,455
I gave him this opportunity to

524
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,415
actually look for the idol when

525
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,249
I took everybody on the

526
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,419
excursion, and he says he

527
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,796
couldn't find it.

528
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,421
>> Clue number five: "Under the

529
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,298
entrance, under the ground,

530
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,509
right where you're living, the

531
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,135
idol is found."

532
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,303
I know that already.

533
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,305
I trust Yau.

534
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,098
It pretty much just came down to

535
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,975
not having the right tools.

536
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,519
I don't think he'll find it

537
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,812
before I get back, but you never

538
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,606
know.

539
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,074
>> Sorry I didn't have the sumo

540
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,159
technique down, but it's not my

541
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,161
forte, you know?

542
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,332
The only sumo I watched was...

543
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,125
was what's it called?

544
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:51,547
<i>Austin Powers,</i> Fat Bastard.

545
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,464
>> Isn't it funny that we're

546
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,882
both really into fashion?

547
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,425
>> I know.

548
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,552
And for me, truthfully, I go

549
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,761
out, I'm just lip gloss, good to

550
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,054
go.

551
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,305
Because if I have to... on top

552
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,682
of that, when I go and work,

553
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,100
have to put all that stuff on, I

554
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,309
don't want to put that on.

555
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,435
I mean, models walk around like

556
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,895
this all day.

557
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,730
I know for myself, my daily

558
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,274
makeup routine is lip gloss and

559
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,651
I'm out.

560
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,902
And of course we fare better

561
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,154
because we're... our ethnic skin

562
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,448
is really on our side.

563
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,199
>> The whole lip-gloss thing,

564
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,158
girl thing is really not my

565
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:20,409
thing.

566
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,286
Basically, I want to take my

567
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,495
T-shirt and hang myself from a

568
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,330
palm tree.

569
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,540
>> So he's like, "Rita, why

00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,249
don't we go out tomorrow for

571
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,125
lunch?

572
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:28,834
Bring your friend."

573
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:29,918
>> My ears are oozing.

574
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,961
You see this?

575
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:31,879
That's the brain coming out.

576
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,462
>> Let me say it to you like

577
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,255
this.

578
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,923
If we all had, like, a one-

579
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,549
bedroom apart, there was four of

580
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,259
us in there, right?-- all right,

581
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,385
let's say me and you woke up

582
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,219
earlier than everybody else all

583
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,805
the time, and we had some things

584
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,098
we just had to talk about, you

585
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,309
go out of the room.

586
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,351
All these conversations they

587
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,353
have are absolutely stupid.

588
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,354
I want to smack them with a

589
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,314
fried pineapple.

590
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,190
I don't know what to do.

591
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,108
It's driving me absolutely

592
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:53,358
crazy.

593
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,068
>> I'm one of those people that

594
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,069
look high-maintenance, but I'm

595
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,405
so low maintenance.

596
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,745
>> So I've done the math on

597
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,579
this, right?

598
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,413
>> Uh-huh.

599
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,331
>> So let's assume we merge with

600
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,665
ten people.

601
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,458
>> Uh-huh.

602
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,543
>> If we win every single

603
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,463
immunity, we end up with us

604
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,423
seven, Ravu has three, Cassandra

605
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,176
and Dreamz switch over, now it's

606
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,260
five and five voting-wise.

607
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,804
>> Cool, whatever.

608
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,931
>> No, it's not cool, whatever.

609
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,514
We don't have the majority

610
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,432
anymore.

611
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,433
You know, for some reason, the

612
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,684
whole situation with Dreamz and

613
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,268
Cassandra had just... it had

614
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,478
really been... sort of been

615
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,230
eating away at me, and I started

616
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,482
to do a little bit of math.

617
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,608
Do you see the obvious, like,

618
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,069
issue we have here?

619
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:37,694
>> We do not need to do business

620
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,613
with them at all, seriously.

621
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,656
I don't think we should include

622
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,573
Dreamz and Cassandra on

623
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,951
anything.

624
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,493
>> Excluding Cassandra and

625
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,079
Dreamz is the dumbest thing we

626
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,038
could do.

627
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:48,956
If we don't keep them happy,

628
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,957
they're going to flip-flop.

629
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,042
Then we're all screwed.

630
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,011
>> Yeah, but we want them all

631
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,471
gone.

632
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,181
>> Yeah, see, dude, but...

633
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:06,556
Oh, God, kill me!

634
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,016
Kill me!

635
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,518
Kill me right now!

636
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,353
How do you not understand what

637
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,438
I'm trying to say to you?

638
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,451
>> I had a little talk with

639
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,453
Alex, and we're like, "Listen,

640
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,371
if Stacy and Lisi are going to

641
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,123
be like this, let's keep

642
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,001
Cassandra and Dreamz close."

643
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,085
>> Boo is so dumb too.

644
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:35,669
Boo does whatever they say.

645
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,295
>> They think because five,

646
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,422
they're in control.

647
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,464
They're not thinking further

648
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,174
ahead like you and me.

649
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,259
So we're kind of the peace

650
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,552
keepers in this tribe right now.

651
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,178
We're trying to put our chess

652
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,972
pieces in place so when we start

653
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,265
really playing the game, we have

654
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,099
them at the right place at the

655
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,058
right time.

656
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:50,892
>> Now, we're going to have our

657
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,476
internal whatevers, but at the

658
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,437
end of the day, we're a team,

659
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,188
and the goal is to take Ravu out

660
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,773
and make it as far as we can,

661
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,233
because we deserve every victory

662
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,818
we've earned.

663
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,819
>> I came back to the shelter,

664
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,778
and it was like they'd embraced

665
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,696
me again.

666
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,363
It was like a warm embrace

667
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:03,572
again.

668
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,532
It didn't change my strategy of

669
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,535
what to do come the merge.

670
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,120
When we get into the merge, me

671
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,371
and Cassandra are going to leave

672
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,957
and go with the other tribe.

673
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:14,666
>> Let's just continue to

674
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,959
battle, remember we're a team,

675
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,210
and just bang it out, just bang

676
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:17,502
it out.

677
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,587
>> Is that a solid solidarity,

678
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,714
guys?

679
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,423
>> It's a solid solidarity,

680
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,215
guys.

681
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:22,841
>> Solid?

682
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:23,675
>> Everybody?

683
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,260
>> That's a great plan,

684
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,929
genocide, genocide.

685
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,139
Saying genocide and wiping out

686
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,348
Ravu, that's just part of the

687
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,308
game now.

688
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,100
It's like poker.

689
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,268
You bluffing, acting like you

690
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:33,852
got something when you don't.

691
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,520
They're always talking about

692
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,480
"Hey, it's a game; it's just

693
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,481
strategy."

694
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,440
So I'm going to just show them.

695
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,483
I can't wait till the day to put

696
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,400
on my snakeskin boots to show

697
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,819
them strategy.

698
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,751
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

699
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,053
We'll now bring in Earl

700
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,638
returning from Exile Island.

701
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,681
>> Hey, Earl!

702
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,766
>> What's going on?

703
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,935
(<i> applause</i> )

704
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,144
>> PROBST: Shall we get to

705
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,395
today's immunity challenge?

706
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,355
>> Yeah.

707
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,565
>> PROBST: First thing's first.

708
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,613
Once again, immunity is back up

709
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,157
for grabs.

710
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,367
For today's challenge, your

711
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,661
memory will be tested.

712
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,453
Scattered in the field are 30

713
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,872
boards.

714
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,707
Each board has a number or a

715
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,128
word painted on it.

716
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,587
One tribe member at a time will

717
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,923
reveal two boards.

718
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,341
If the numbers or words match,

719
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,134
you score a point for your

720
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,135
tribe.

721
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,678
First tribe to seven wins

722
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,596
immunity, guaranteed at least

723
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,391
one more day out here in Fiji.

724
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,184
Losers, tribal council tonight,

725
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:56,643
somebody going home.

726
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,687
To make it a little more

727
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,188
complicated, there are four

728
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,982
dummy boards that do not have a

729
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,482
match.

730
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,483
I'll give you a minute to

731
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,318
strategize.

732
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,904
We'll get started.

733
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,575
Moto won the rock, paper,

734
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,535
scissor.

735
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,120
Once you leave the platform,

736
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,163
there is no coaching from your

737
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,331
tribe.

738
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:23,211
Edgardo heads out for Moto.

739
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,131
Edgardo flips over the seven.

740
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:31,803
Trying to use his ESP and flips

741
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,433
over the priest-- no match.

742
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:40,937
Rocky heads out for Ravu.

743
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,524
Rocky reveals the nine.

744
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,610
Going somewhere new, hoping to

745
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,652
get lucky.

746
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,695
No luck.

747
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,156
Rocky reveals the four.

748
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,991
Cassandra heads out for Moto.

749
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,242
Cassandra would like to reveal

750
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,368
something that's already been

751
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,620
shown.

752
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,662
Cassandra reveals the eight, yet

753
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:02,626
another new number.

754
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,378
Cassandra hoping to get lucky.

755
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,338
Cassandra...

756
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,174
(<i> cheering</i> )

757
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,468
Cassandra lucks into a match.

758
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,052

Boo flips over the first seven.

Rita flips over the 14.

Yau-Man reveals one priest.

785
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,008
Can he remember where the second

786
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,094
priest just was?

787
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,018
Yau-Man surveying the course,

No help.

No need to look this way.

794
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,540
You're just going to tempt your

795
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,792
tribe into losing a turn.

796
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,128
Yau-Man cannot ask his tribe for

797
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:10,670

798
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,757
It's all on him.

799
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,347
Yau-Man makes his selection, and

800
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,973
it is wrong.

801
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,893
Yau-Man chooses princess, does

802
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,853
not match up with priest.

803
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,688
Chance for Ravu to get in this

804
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,190

your turn because your tribe

You cannot do that.

00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,947
So I dropped the ball.

951
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,407
I want to apologize for that.

952
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,200
But at the same time, this mass

953
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,702
confusion thing, everyone

954
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,120
talking at the same time,

955
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,871
everyone going (<i> gibbering</i> )

956
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,206
like that, like, in our dire

957
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,583
straits right now, mentally, how

958
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,418
can anybody like...

959
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,085
>> Concentrate.

960
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,712
>> ...concentrate or comprehend

961
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,255
absolutely anything?

962
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,881
>> People have to listen and

963
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,174
know when to be quiet, like...

964
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:30,800
>> It's not like I'm yelling at

965
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,718
anybody.

966
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,260
It's just...

967
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,052
>> No, but, you know, everyone

968
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,471
has to really put the brakes on

969
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,141
and know when to step back and

970
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,059
be quiet, because...

971
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:40,643
>> Let me ask you a question.

972
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,269
When we were winning, when we

973
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,563
were this close, is that the

974
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,689
best you've felt since you've

975
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,190
been here?

976
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,191
That's the best I've felt in 14

977
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:51,779
days.

978
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,363
>> Getting rid of Rocky would

979
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,197
probably get rid of a lot of the

980
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,658
friction in the tribe.

981
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,701
If you lay your cards on the

982
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,702
like that at this point, when

983
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,204
people are looking for anything,

984
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,498
absolutely anything to get rid

985
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,208
of somebody, don't be surprised

986
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,127
if people follow up on it.

987
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:06,753
>> Rita is running her mouth all

988
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,838
day, guys.

989
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,047
All she does is run her mouth.

990
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:10,882
All through the challenge,

991
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,632
that's all she was doing.

992
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,175
>> "It's over here!

993
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:12,967
It's over here!

994
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,760
It's over here!"

995
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,469
A lot of us have been looking at

996
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,803
Rita.

997
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,929
Some folks are really sick of

998
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,182
hearing from Rita.

999
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,308
Around the last vote, my head

1000
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,060
was on the chopping block, but

1001
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,312
I'm going to keep my ears open

1002
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,271
and hope nobody tries to flip

1003
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,606
the script on me, because right

1004
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,523
now this is still anybody's

1005
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,901
vote.

1006
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,508
>> Oh, my God.

1007
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,300
>> What do you want to do

1008
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,427
tonight?

1009
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,644
>> Is Anthony okay with you

1010
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,394
then?

1011
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:05,770
>> That's fine.

1012
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,979
>> Anthony okay with you?

1013
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,563
>> Uh-huh.

1014
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,439
>> All right.

1015
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,233
Anthony okay with you, Yau-Man?

1016
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,318
All right, it's done.

1017
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,780
>> Yup, we got our majority

1018
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,614
right there, so just let Rocky

1019
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,366
know, okay?

1020
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,539
>> Yeah, I'm coming.

1021
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,459
>> That mouth of hers, it drives

1022
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,546
me... am I wrong?

1023
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,588
Am I wrong, all the yakking and

1024
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,798
talking, bro?

1025
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,174
>> Well, you know what's funny

1026
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,801
is Anthony has been...

1027
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,718
>> Shady, bro.

1028
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,553
>> He's starting to gain, like,

1029
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,637
a little confidence or

1030
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,138
something.

1031
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:41,722
Like personally, I'd like to

1032
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,307
take him out, but...

1033
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:43,891
>> I got to get rid of Rita

1034
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,392
first, bro.

1035
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,269
I mean, worst comes to worst, he

1036
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,770
can be next, but Rita's got to

1037
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,271
go, buddy.

1038
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,106
Like, I don't know what's up

1039
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:50,857
with your boy Anthony.

1040
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,149
You know him better than me.

1041
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,025
I don't know if he's being shady

1042
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:53,317
or whatever.

1043
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,363
So I need you my side.

1044
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,322
>> Usually I'm the person that

1045
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,448
brings up strategy, like, "Well,

1046
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:04,203
let's do this, let's do that."

1047
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:04,829
The other people are starting to

1048
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,289
devise their own plans.

1049
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,373
I think before they were just

1050
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,417
going with the majority, but it

1051
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,334
seems like everyone's doing

1052
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,210
their own thing, trying to play

1053
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,378
their own game now.

1054
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,755
You have to watch your back.

1055
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,611
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, you were so

1056
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,405
close.

1057
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,282
How frustrating is it?

1058
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,283
>> It's very frustrating, and

1059
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,620
for me, personally, it was very

1060
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,370
embarrassing.

1061
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,956
My brains went into neutral when

1062
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,457
it came to my turn, and I

1063
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,417
couldn't remember something I

1064
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,376
saw 30 seconds ago.

1065
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,295
I hope it's a temporary

1066
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,172
condition, because otherwise I'm

1067
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,340
in bad shape.

1068
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,926
>> PROBST: Mookie, did you guys

1069
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,427
get beat today, or did you give

1070
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,970
it away?

1071
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,055
>> Jeff, it's hard to, you know,

1072
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,222
follow through when everyone's

1073
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,223
talking to you at one time.

1074
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,391
I know Rocky came up and took

1075
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,601
the blame for the last point,

1076
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,602
and it wasn't completely his

1077
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,561
fault.

1078
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,562
We all jumped in, and we all

1079
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,230
told him where we thought things

1080
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:13,856
were, and you know, we confused

1081
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,357
him.

1082
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,192
>> PROBST: Rocky, why are you

1083
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,360
trying to take the fall?

1084
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,402
>> I swear if we would have won

1085
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,321
that challenge, that whole

1086
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,115
island would have exploded.

1087
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,367
We were so close, and I took

1088
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,660
that away from myself, and I

1089
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,661
took that away from my tribe,

1090
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,370
and I felt bad.

1091
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,412
>> PROBST: Rita, you're going

1092
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,415
through something very extreme.

1093
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,959
When you get tired of thinking

1094
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,377
how bad things are, what do you

1095
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,419
talk about to get your mind off

1096
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,963
of things?

1097
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,881
>> Well, I tell little stories

1098
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,174
that I think might be

1099
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,467
interesting to keep their mind

1100
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,678
off this dire situation that

1101
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,345
we're in and try to keep

1102
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,556
everybody entertained.

1103
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,891
>> PROBST: Earl, are we at a

1104
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:49,475
point in the game where the

1105
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,353
reasons you vote somebody out

1106
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,313
are starting to change?

1107
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,606
>> I do believe the reasons are

1108
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,941
starting to change.

1109
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,442
I really think before, some of

1110
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,152
the decisions were pretty quick.

1111
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:00,695
But I think now people are

1112
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,404
starting to get to know one

1113
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,488
another.

1114
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,240
I think it's about the

1115
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,243
chemistry.

1116
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,202
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, been out

1117
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,537
here long enough that you can

1118
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,913
now say you trust the people in

1119
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,873
this tribe anyway?

1120
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,500
>> My credo in life is love

1121
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,919
many, trust few, do wrong to

1122
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:17,336
none.

1123
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,131
So the question is what is few?

1124
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:20,756
Whether I trust them depends on

1125
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,717
whether my strategy dovetails

1126
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,220
with theirs or not.

1127
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,179
>> PROBST: Anthony, as we get

1128
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,931
ready to go to the vote, how

1129
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,683
uncomfortable are you that it

1130
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,726
might be you?

1131
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,727
>> Fairly uncomfortable.

1132
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,811
I mean, my personality does

1133
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,271
clash with some people, and they

1134
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,397
may think that I'm trying

1135
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,732
something when I'm trying to

1136
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,233
bring as much honesty to people

1137
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,359
as I can.

1138
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,571
>> PROBST: Okay, if anybody has

1139
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,115
the hidden immunity idol and you

1140
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,241
want to play it, you would

1141
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,659
present it to me after the votes

1142
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,077
have been cast but before I read

1143
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,078
them.

1144
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,371
It is time to vote.

1145
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,790
Earl, you're up.

1146
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,386
>> As you know, this tribe works

1147
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,181
from majorities, and at this

1148
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,223
point, I couldn't go against

1149
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,768
them.

1150
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,904
>> We had our differences, but I

1151
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,905
like you a lot.

1152
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,991
Good luck.

1153
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,795
>> It comes down to who is the

1154
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,587
most disposable.

1155
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,466
Sorry, nothing personal.

1156
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,139
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1157
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,683
votes.

1158
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:03,943
If anybody has the hidden

1159
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,528
immunity idol and you want to

1160
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,529
play it, now is the time to do

1161
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:11,659
so.

1162
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,701
Okay, once the votes are read,

1163
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,452
the decision is final.

1164
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,287
The person voted out will be

1165
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,330
asked to leave the tribal

1166
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:17,498
council area immediately.

1167
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,000
I'll read the votes.

1168
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:26,674
First vote, Anthony.

1169
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,591
Rita.

1170
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:32,096
One vote Rita.

1171
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,056
Anthony.

1172
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,519
Two votes Anthony.

1173
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,937
Rita.

1174
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,438
Two votes Anthony, two votes

1175
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,317
Rita.

1176
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,569
Rita.

1177
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,611
That's three votes Rita, two

1178
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:52,992
votes Anthony.

1179
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,034
Fifth person voted out of

1180
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,829
<i>Survivor: Fiji,</i> Rita.

1181
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,663
That's four, that's enough.

1182
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,332
You need to bring me your torch.

1183
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:11,510
Rita, the tribe has spoken.

1184
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,595
It's time for you to go.

1185
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,139
>> Thank you.

1186
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,599
Good luck.

1187
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,649
>> PROBST: Well, the good news

1188
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,818
is today's challenge showed you

1189
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,737
still have the will to win.

1190
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,946
That will is what you got to

1191
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,281
hang on to tomorrow morning when

1192
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,866
you get up to start another day.

1193
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,658
Grab your torches.

1194
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,075
Head back to camp.

1195
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,661
Good night.

1196
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,258
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1197
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,635
from our next episode.

1198
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,224
>> PROBST: Next time on

1199
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,433
<i>Survivor...</i>

1200
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:00,017
Drop your buffs.

1201
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,018
>> What?

1202
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:01,852
>> ...a major shake-up...

1203
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,645
>> Come on, Dreamz.

1204
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,229
>> PROBST: Maybe the biggest

1205
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,272
rivalry thus far just paired up.

1206
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,440
...changes everything.

1207
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:07,066
>> Right now we're a super

1208
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:07,733
power.

1209
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,567
>> PROBST: One very big decision

1210
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,444
left to make.

1211
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:11,070
Which group is going to live on

1212
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,905
the Moto beach and which group

1213
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,074
is going to Ravu?

1214
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:22,748
>> I'm really surprised, and I'm

1215
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,584
sad at the result tonight, but I

1216
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,002
understand it's a game.

1217
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,545
I really tried to stay true and

1218
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,797
honest, and I did trust my

1219
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,423
alliances.

1220
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,341
So maybe I was just too nice to

1221
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,926
play the game.

1222
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,094
But if that's the case, I leave

1223
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,263
this game feeling very proud.

1224
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:37,888
I just hope that I have made my

1225
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,722
kids proud, because that's main

1226
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,891
reason that I did this.
