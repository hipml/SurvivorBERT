2
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:04,260
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:06,561
Everyone, throw away your bandanas!

4
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:08,568
We will change the tribes.

5
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:10,505
After a surprise change,

6
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:12,605
the new tribes 
were completely different.

7
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:16,483
At Coyopa, we have 
three close duos, and Keith.

8
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:20,953
At Hunahpu, we have 
a close duo, Josh and Reed,

9
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:22,578
with a group of single people.

10
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,740
The new Coyopa 
had a fake idol...

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,633
It's not an idol, 
but it could be used one day.

12
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:29,811
...a true idol...

13
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:30,995
Oh yeah !

14
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,726
...and a whole new 
dominating couple.

15
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:35,660
Missy and Baylor want us 
and Kelley and Dale want us.

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,717
It's pretty crazy.

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,828
In the new Hunahpu, 
Jeremy, Natalie and Julie

18
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:43,166
dreaded 
losing their ally, Reed.

19
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,720
So it will be enough for Josh to 
exert his influence on Reed

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,075
for Reed to switch sides.

21
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:51,161
To make matters worse, 
everyone was starving.

22
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:53,763
What are we going to do 
to have more to eat?

23
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:56,072
We are reduced 
to a handful of rice.

24
00:00:56,505 --> 00:01:00,494
Jeremy wins immunity for Hunahpu!

25
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,610
And after gaining immunity,

26
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,744
Hunahpu made 
a desperate plea.

27
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:08,157
We have nothing more to eat. 
We would like to trade for rice.

28
00:01:08,157 --> 00:01:09,976
The bill will be salted.

29
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:11,878
I have a council to organize.

30
00:01:11,878 --> 00:01:13,578
We'll see each other tomorrow 
and we'll find a solution.

31
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:16,131
Coyopa to face the council...

32
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:18,001
We have to figure out 
who we are close to.

33
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,161
...Jon and Jaclyn had to 
choose between two couples.

34
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:24,336
Dale is sneaky, 
and I'm sure his daughter is too.

35
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:27,240
But Baylor has already let me down 
and it could do it again.

36
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:31,561
And at the council, they decided 
to stay with Missy and Baylor...

37
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:33,619
- Kelly. 
- It's okay, Dad.

38
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,159
...eliminating Kelley, Dale's daughter.

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,977
Kelley, the tribe has spoken.

40
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:42,439
There are thirteen left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

41
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,819
What party !

42
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,748
At least it's over.

43
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:05,575
The advice 
surely couldn't have been worse.

44
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,060
For me, 
it was obviously upsetting.

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,214
You see complete strangers...

46
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:14,233
slaughter your daughter before your eyes.

47
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:16,436
And you can't do anything about it.

48
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,495
I had never seen my daughter 
go through something so hard.

49
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:26,402
And no father could be 
more proud of his daughter than I of Kelley.

50
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:30,964
It's rough.

51
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:36,115
But I won't give up 
as long as I can talk.

52
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:47,762
Health !

53
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:50,188
How are you ?

54
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:51,814
I'm going to make breakfast.

55
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:56,597
Looking at yesterday's votes, 
I know who's next.

56
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:02,104
I have to do something drastic 
to make sure I stay.

57
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:05,060
I'm not dead until 
I see my name four times.

58
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:06,599
What's this ?

59
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:08,672
An idol.

60
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,809
So know it, 
since at the next vote,

61
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,577
I guess I'm targeted.

62
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,914
The idol is not real.

63
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:19,567
I took it on the well, 
the first day.

64
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,969
They ignore it.

65
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,014
They will spend two sleepless nights 
believing it to be true.

66
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,820
- So I'm not leaving next time. 
- OK.

67
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:31,874
It seems like.

68
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:34,536
This morning 
Dale showed me an idol.

69
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:37,438
If we lose the next immunity,

70
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:40,386
the idol could ruin our plans.

71
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,392
And that really scares me.

72
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,405
I hope he won't 
raze our camp.

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,557
I think that if.

74
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:54,527
If we have to give up the roof, 
we're screwed.

75
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,754
It would be horrible. 
I don't know what I would do.

76
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,578
The fire goes out, 
we can no longer cook...

77
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:03,027
In the mess.

78
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:08,620
After we won immunity yesterday,

79
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,876
Reed asked Jeff 
if we could do a trade.

80
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,169
For rice.

81
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,026
If we make a trade for rice, 
Jeff's gonna screw us up.

82
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:18,494
I don't want that.

83
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:20,163
Come on, collect!

84
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:23,164
We could win 
a reward and celebrate tomorrow!

85
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,772
Why such a hunger 
for a little rice?

86
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:30,192
Is beyond me.

87
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,808
- Oh my God ! 
- Oh Lord!

88
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:50,354
Hi Jeff!

89
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,775
Hello Jeff!

90
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:53,540
Health.

91
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,288
Let's get together and discuss.

92
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,778
Oh damn it!

93
00:05:04,723 --> 00:05:05,796
I'm afraid.

94
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:06,869
What are you afraid of, Julie?

95
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,569
Of what will happen.

96
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,049
- I'm afraid. 
- How much rice do you have?

97
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,503
- You want to see ? 
- A...

98
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:15,394
- Like, a... 
- A cup like this.

99
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:16,881
- A handful. 
- Not even.

100
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,803
It's rather depressing.

101
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:23,015
- Yeah, nothing. 
- Barely enough to taste.

102
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:25,083
One teaspoon each.

103
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,692
So you only have 
a handful of rice left.

104
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:33,223
Think how many times 
we've done this adventure.

105
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:37,700
On only one other occasion 
was it necessary to supply rice again.

106
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,405
It was in Australia.

107
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,412
And it was due to 
many other difficulties.

108
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:45,169
Reed, what can we 
infer about this tribe?

109
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:50,621
Too many cooks in the kitchen, 
who wanted to make too much rice.

110
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:53,675
- Too many customers, rather! 
- It's true.

111
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:57,574
Dominant personalities 
insisted on eating.

112
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:01,397
We don't necessarily want to 
oppose and become a target,

113
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:04,463
only to regret it later. 
What is happening to us now.

114
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:09,206
Josh, in your tribe, 
you did the right thing.

115
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:11,678
We mix, 
and here you are in a tribe

116
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:13,201
who has almost nothing left.

117
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:14,877
How do you react ?

118
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:16,501
Jeff, it's been really hard, honestly.

119
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,310
We arrive, and: 
"Oh, by the way, we have nothing to eat."

120
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,862
We didn't eat much

121
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:26,625
and now nothing. 
I feel so weak.

122
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,538
I want to say, 
"Damn, guys!"

123
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:32,553
It's not like you 
stopped us when we arrived.

124
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:35,817
I must say 
there never was a tribe,

125
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:39,685
in the history of Survivor, 
who needed help so much

126
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,410
after only fourteen days.

127
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,134
First, you lose your flint.

128
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:49,095
You are losing fire! 
And must exchange the fishing kit.

129
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:51,762
And now 
you're out of rice

130
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,702
and you need help again.

131
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,343
And I don't lose sight

132
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:59,943
that disproportion 
in food

133
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:03,239
probably played an 
important role in your dominance

134
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,587
so far in the tests.

135
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:07,838
So, to keep the game fair,

136
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:11,852
and in fairness to Coyopa, 
who plays as you should,

137
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:14,514
the penalty must be fair.

138
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,723
I have enough rice

139
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:19,412
to last until the end of the game.

140
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:22,730
But the penalty will be severe.

141
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,366
This is what I want.

142
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:28,417
Your tarp, your hammock,

143
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,065
your bedding, pillows, 
blankets, candles.

144
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,756
All the rewards 
you have earned.

145
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:36,145
The hatchet, the hammer,

146
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:38,442
one of the pots, 
and the second flint.

147
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,989
Which will leave you with a machete, 
a pot and a flint.

148
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,725
You start from scratch.

149
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,830
Unhook the tarp.

150
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,278
Jeff took our comfort, 
our tools and a pot,

151
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:09,280
and for me, it's... 
It's worth it.

152
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,653
The infamous 
second flint!

153
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,681
They are all happy. 
I'm pissed.

154
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:18,129
You know we have nothing left?

155
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,635
Why are you happy?

156
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,467
It's really frustrating.

157
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:30,737
We made all our comfort, 
it feared a max.

158
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:33,297
Not having a tarp 
affects me particularly.

159
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:37,326
I don't know if it affects 
others as much as me.

160
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,532
But I know it is for me.

161
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:41,492
I dread the rain.

162
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:44,771
Being cold will be a test for me.

163
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,326
- Good. 
- Thank you, Jeff.

164
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,090
- Good luck. 
- Thanks.

165
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,630
- Thank you, Jeff. 
- Let's hope it doesn't rain.

166
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,365
Over here everyone!

167
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:44,895
Hunahpu, discover 
the new Coyopa tribe.

168
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,826
Kelley was eliminated 
at the last council.

169
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,465
Oh my God !

170
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:57,303
Ready for a new 
reward challenge?

171
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,660
Today, one member of each 
team will be blindfolded.

172
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,563
You will overcome a series of obstacles

173
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,966
to a position 
where there is a mask.

174
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:09,524
You will study it with your fingers.

175
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:11,734
Then you will untie 
bags of puzzle pieces,

176
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,147
come back to a second position,

177
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:18,183
where you will use these parts 
to recreate the mask.

178
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:21,036
To mislead you, there are decoys.

179
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:24,127
They will look similar, 
but will not match.

180
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:28,025
The first person to succeed 
wins the reward.

181
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:30,094
- Do you want to know what's at stake? 
- Yes.

182
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:31,542
You should like it.

183
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,892
Oh my God !

184
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,738
Lord ! Lord !

185
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:44,064
With the grill, 
what it takes to light it,

186
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,205
and meat. It's worth it ?

187
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,044
- Yes. 
- Well yes !

188
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:48,979
Good. Since the change,

189
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:57,207
So today you can 
field your champion.

190
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,856
Who is cut out for this event?

191
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:01,280
- How are you? 
- Yeah.

192
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,794
Qui y va chez Hunahpu ?

193
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,710
- It'll be me, Jeff. 
- Reed will go.

194
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,085
Coyopa, who goes and there?

195
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:12,024
Baylor versus Reed. The winner 
takes home the reward for their tribe.

196
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:14,049
The loser goes to Exile Island.

197
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,122
Take a seat, let's get started.

198
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,331
Let's go. For the reward.

199
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:27,594
Survivors, ready?

200
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:40,706
Reed hits the 1st hurdle hard, 
but it doesn't slow him down.

201
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,228
Baylor really takes its time.

202
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,499
Reed is at the first post, 
he has his first bag,

203
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:56,112
and he analyzes the puzzle.

204
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:58,043
Different strategy for Baylor.

205
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:00,251
She takes the bag and leaves.

206
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,746
We'll have to bring back 
the three bags anyway.

207
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:07,036
The difference is the order 
in which you do things.

208
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:10,847
Reed came back. Baylor has returned 
to the puzzle table.

209
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,933
Reed returns to examine the mask.

210
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,857
Your companions could help you, 
but they are not allowed to.

211
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:22,431
Name of...

212
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:25,187
You are on your own.

213
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:29,378
This is perhaps 
the biggest reward so far.

214
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:31,441
Lots of meat.

215
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:35,377
Baylor has her second bag, 
she's coming back.

216
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:37,850
Reed has his second bag, he's coming back.

217
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,145
Reed flies over the obstacle.

218
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:49,483
Baylor bangs his head.

219
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:53,698
Baylor is going to get its 3rd bag.

220
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,020
Reed studies his plays.

221
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,044
Two very different strategies.

222
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,363
Two up.

223
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:00,920
Big up.

224
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:02,861
The nose.

225
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,878
Reed goes to get his third bag.

226
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:10,464
Baylor has the third bag.

227
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:13,081
On the head, a blow in the bar.

228
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,782
Reed has his third bag.

229
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:17,237
Baylor returns with its 3rd bag.

230
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:23,092
Baylor has all the necessary parts.

231
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:26,850
She can start trying 
to recreate this mask.

232
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,058
Reed has all the pieces now.

233
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,885
This is where it gets fun.

234
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:34,819
You have to remember the shapes 
using only your fingers.

235
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:49,581
Seven pieces are needed, 
but these bags hold much more.

236
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,322
This is the problem.

237
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:55,320
If you could see, you would know 
that the lures are red.

238
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:59,694
If only you could see! 
Huge in-game reward!

239
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,010
Reed placed two pieces.

240
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,737
One for Baylor.

241
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:18,628
Reed places a third coin 
on his mask.

242
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:22,107
But that's not necessarily fair.

243
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,753
Reed places a 4th piece.

244
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,171
Baylor places another coin 
on his mask.

245
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,011
Reed places another piece.

246
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,122
Baylor only placed two.

247
00:14:37,122 --> 00:14:38,775
He's missing five.

248
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:43,875
Reed is only missing one piece.

249
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,922
- If that's right. 
- If that's right, Jeff!

250
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:51,235
Baylor struggles but does not progress.

251
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,830
You, I'm not sure.

252
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:58,717
Reed is going to change a part, 
he has doubts.

253
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:00,197
Is he right ?

254
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:02,951
Jeff, is that okay?

255
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,024
Reed thinks he's there.

256
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,289
Reed is right! Reed wins 
the reward for his tribe!

257
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,536
- Cheer ! 
- Chicken and beef skewers!

258
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:15,939
- Cheer ! 
- And here are the tears.

259
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,894
You succeeded ! You succeeded !

260
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:21,688
- You succeeded ! 
- You did it, honey!

261
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:25,403
- Impressive, Reed! 
- That was crazy!

262
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,152
Reed, why the immediate tears?

263
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:29,758
It's stressful.

264
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,836
I'm so hungry.

265
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:36,508
How are you, Baylor?

266
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,201
You know, everyone is hungry.

267
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,043
So...

268
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:45,801
Confidence takes a hit, 
"damn, I can't do it".

269
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,598
You feel like you've 
let your tribe down.

270
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:55,839
Reed, come here.

271
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,601
Good, Reed!

272
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:01,619
Baylor goes to Exile Island.

273
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:05,335
Choose a member 
of your tribe to accompany him.

274
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:08,760
There is a good chance 
that the person you choose

275
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,635
will not benefit from this reward.

276
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:15,148
I thought about it a lot.

277
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:19,345
It seems to me that 
Julie really rocks here,

278
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,656
and that would give him a chance

279
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:25,133
to show John 
what she can take.

280
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,294
I was going to volunteer.

281
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,317
Interesting. 
You want to send Julie,

282
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:35,043
and Natalie offers to go.

283
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:37,756
- Julie is doing her part, and... 
- Yes, but...

284
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:40,781
- Everyone does their part. 
- Not me.

285
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:45,385
Reed, one person you want to 
send and one who wants to go.

286
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:50,067
Frankly, if Natalie wants 
to go so badly, I won't stop her.

287
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:52,116
So, Natalie, gear up!

288
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:53,397
- Natalie, come down. 
- Thank you, Natalie.

289
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:54,151
You're welcome.

290
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,787
- Thank you, Natalie. 
- Well done Natalie! Well done Reed!

291
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:59,143
Make the best of it. Cheer.

292
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:04,572
Good. Natalie, Baylor,

293
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:07,978
on their way to exile. You will come back 
for the next immunity.

294
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:10,163
Hope we don't get lost.

295
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,516
- Thank you, Natalie. 
- Bye.

296
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:13,593
- I love you, Bay! 
- Bye.

297
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,856
Hunahpu, your dominance 
in this game

298
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,941
continues. Congratulation.

299
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:25,182
Take your things, on the way. 
Have a good afternoon.

300
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,932
Coyopa, it seems 
like I always say the same thing.

301
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,408
I have nothing for you. 
Take your things, return to camp.

302
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,613
Baylor is in very good hands. 
Natalie volunteered.

303
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:47,215
I know Natalie is with me.

304
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:49,335
I think it will be very profitable.

305
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:10,870
It bites, but...

306
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,669
The fish must be 
too small, no way to catch them.

307
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:16,753
They nibble.

308
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,348
And they steal my bait, 
every time.

309
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,153
So Missy. 
Natalie is always with you.

310
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:31,202
Completely. No chance 
of her letting me down at this point.

311
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:35,242
OK. This morning 
Dale showed me an idol.

312
00:18:37,823 --> 00:18:39,460
- It's not true ! 
- Yeah. So...

313
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,427
- It really sucks. 
- If we don't win immunity,

314
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:47,801
we could use Dale 
to eliminate Keith.

315
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:52,672
Today Dale showed 
Jon that he has an idol.

316
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,195
It thwarts our plans a bit.

317
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,779
I don't see 
how Keith could stay.

318
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:00,637
I would love to, 
but I don't see how.

319
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:16,135
Alright, let's find that camp.

320
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,215
- Where is he ? 
- I do not know.

321
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,104
volunteered for exile,

322
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:23,871
I hope it will work in my favor.

323
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,269
At the merger, 
it will prove to Missy and Baylor

324
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,902
that they will have to take care 
of Natalie if necessary.

325
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:35,014
"An idol is hidden on your camp."

326
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,581
"Buried", "flag", "ten", "of".

327
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:43,257
"It's up to you whether you want to 
share this information."

328
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,968
Baylor immediately showed me the clue,

329
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,996
without me asking him.

330
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:51,605
- Ten something... 
- Buried by the flag.

331
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:54,542
Obtain information 
from Baylor, in the long term,

332
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:57,576
it is far more important 
than the reward.

333
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,794
I have to find this idol.

334
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:01,482
Jeremy and I

335
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,249
- we have to find her. 
- Yeah.

336
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:06,407
- It would be great. 
- And then we unroll.

337
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:07,186
Yeah.

338
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,670
Jeremy, Julie and I are in danger.

339
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,374
In the long term, I listen to Baylor,

340
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:16,980
because I have confidence in Missy, 
and therefore in Baylor.

341
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:23,827
Reed, you tore it all up!

342
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,015
We're going to eat tonight!

343
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:29,898
Reed, you're a chef!

344
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:32,297
I'm very proud of Reed.

345
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,678
We come back with 
eight skewers and a barbecue.

346
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:38,140
And me: "Yeah, that's my guy!

347
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,693
It's thanks to him !"

348
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:43,056
Thank you for contributing to the tribe!

349
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:45,822
I'm so excited to eat.

350
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,041
You did it.

351
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,011
I love you so much.

352
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:52,233
Josh and Reed behave 
like the bosses.

353
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:55,597
And then they coo.

354
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:59,144
If Val was here, 
we'd be so apart

355
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:01,322
that you would think 
we don't like each other at all.

356
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:03,525
That's what you should do. 
But these two

357
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,652
stuck together all the time, it's dangerous.

358
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:11,100
- These skewers are huge. 
- In effect.

359
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,496
- Eight skewers! 
- Who prefers chicken to beef?

360
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:17,963
- Vive Hunahpu ! 
- Hunahpu !

361
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,089
I love meat.

362
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:22,269
I eat a lot of it.

363
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:24,271
It was incredible.

364
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:25,740
I got kicked out of it.

365
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,296
Lord ! It's beef!

366
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:28,934
- My God ! 
- This is exceptional.

367
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:32,215
We feasted, 
but we no longer have a tarp,

368
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:35,083
because our gifted 
have decided to give it up.

369
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,537
If we had just waited 24 hours, 
we would have had a full meal.

370
00:21:38,537 --> 00:21:40,185
They are too stupid.

371
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,006
- It's refreshing! 
- Yeah.

372
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:48,813
Give me an item of clothing 
you want to keep dry.

373
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,511
Amazing 
how the temperature has changed.

374
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:55,653
- Look at the height of the tide! 
- It's freezing !

375
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:56,743
I'm already soaked.

376
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:57,877
Me too.

377
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:00,922
Of course, the day 
we return the tarp, it's raining.

378
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,666
No lull in sight, apparently.

379
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,185
It might take a while.

380
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:15,061
Shit, it's falling apart.

381
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,281
Oh my God.

382
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:29,964
This rain sucks.

383
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:31,288
I say.

384
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:34,199
I can't stand 
being wet all night.

385
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,256
I say.

386
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:36,509
I'm about to break down.

387
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:38,059
I am at the limit.

388
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,227
For sure.

389
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,313
Sad situation.

390
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:47,460
In tears, ready to leave.

391
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:49,997
Oh my God.

392
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:51,531
I don't know if I can do it.

393
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,392
Not all night.

394
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:54,463
I can't.

395
00:22:54,937 --> 00:22:57,487
If Julie gives up, 
I don't know what to do.

396
00:22:57,487 --> 00:22:59,496
I need a majority.

397
00:22:59,496 --> 00:23:01,540
But if she has to leave,

398
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:04,194
she has to go first...

399
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:07,227
Before me. You see ?

400
00:23:07,227 --> 00:23:10,572
To be able to achieve fusion 
and work wonders.

401
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,018
Don't let yourself down.

402
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,255
The day will be sunny.

403
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:34,042
I can't stand 
another night like this.

404
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:35,474
- I can't. 
- I say.

405
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:39,489
Don't let them see you like this, okay?

406
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:41,585
- Nope. 
- Hold on. Hold on.

407
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,393
OK ? It will be fine.

408
00:23:43,393 --> 00:23:44,656
This bad night is over.

409
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,043
No, I do not think so. It will be the same 
every night for a while.

410
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:50,043
And I won't last.

411
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,955
Jeremy came over to check on me.

412
00:23:53,955 --> 00:23:56,547
He tells me to hold on,

413
00:23:56,547 --> 00:24:00,418
that he needs me, 
that we will protect ourselves.

414
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:01,919
I need you, my daughter.

415
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,144
We are almost at the merger.

416
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:04,023
Yeah.

417
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,076
Last night exhausted me.

418
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:09,181
It was the hardest night of my life.

419
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:13,868
I've thought about it a million times. 
"It's hard, but you can walk away."

420
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:15,417
But I'm here.

421
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:18,215
And that says it all.

422
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:20,028
It's Survivor!

423
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:21,399
You signed up for this!

424
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:22,645
Go home !

425
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:42,876
Over here everyone!

426
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:58,840
Let's welcome Natalie and Baylor 
back from Exile Island.

427
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:06,169
Come on Baylor.

428
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:10,129
- Ready for the immunity test? 
- Yeah !

429
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:12,337
First of all, Julie, I get her back.

430
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:21,490
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

431
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,914
Today 
you will climb a high wall.

432
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:30,761
Then you will move a large 
wooden cube from post to post.

433
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,825
At each post, 
you will collect a bag of coins.

434
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:37,590
Once the three bags have been collected,

435
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:40,977
two team members will use 
the rolls they contain

436
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:43,155
to solve 
a flag puzzle.

437
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:45,962
The first tribe 
to do so wins immunity,

438
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:49,270
is out of the vote. Losers, 
you know the song.

439
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,486
Someone will be eliminated from the board.

440
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,482
Hunahpu, you have one more member, 
who will not participate?

441
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:56,099
Julie or me.

442
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:57,703
I would say Julie, but...

443
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,230
Okay that's good.

444
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:01,091
Julie will not participate.

445
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:03,590
Take a seat on the bench. 
The others, a minute of organization

446
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,575
and we start.

447
00:26:11,423 --> 00:26:13,848
Let's go. For immunity.

448
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:16,173
Survivors, ready? 
Go!

449
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,511
Everyone must cross the wall.

450
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:23,127
After fifteen days,

451
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:26,379
this three meter wall 
seems much higher.

452
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,123
The Hunahpu passed. 
They start moving their cube.

453
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:34,421
- This cube is very heavy. 
- 1, 2, 3, come on!

454
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:37,808
It's good, you lead!

455
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:39,414
Carry on, carry on!

456
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:42,181
The Coyopa have passed. 
They move their cube.

457
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:47,248
- Go on ! 
- It's good, you assure!

458
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,207
Now you have to climb 
and bring back the first bag.

459
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,121
- Go on ! 
- Jeremy climbs for Hunahpu.

460
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:52,925
Come on Jeremy!

461
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:55,155
You can't detach it, 
you have to twist it.

462
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,558
- Throw it! 
- Jon, on the 1st sack for Coyopa.

463
00:26:59,114 --> 00:27:01,044
Jon picks up the pace.

464
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:02,557
Come on !

465
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:04,592
The Coyopa have the first bag.

466
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:06,460
- Go on ! 
- One more turn!

467
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,754
Jeremy has the 1st sack for Hunahpu.

468
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:11,975
Perfect equality at the start of the race.

469
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:15,418
Its good.

470
00:27:15,418 --> 00:27:16,970
- Climb ! 
- Come on Jon!

471
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,887
Jon goes to get the second bag.

472
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,748
- Push, push! 
- Go on !

473
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:23,239
Jeremy climbs again for Hunahpu.

474
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:26,173
Jon spins the bag 
at a very good pace.

475
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:27,872
The Coyopa have their second bag.

476
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,178
They move 
on to the third and final bag.

477
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:32,489
Yes, Jeremy, it's good!

478
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,310
Jeremy is stuck!

479
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,399
It's hooked! 
Big setback for Hunahpu!

480
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,338
- Go on ! 
- They are used to winning,

481
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,125
but here they are lagging behind.

482
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,075
Back, Jeremy.

483
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:44,365
- Shoot it! 
- So !

484
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:45,166
Go on !

485
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,776
Coyopa, looking for the 3rd bag.

486
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:48,941
- Attention. 
- In the other direction.

487
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:50,373
Jeremy is still stuck.

488
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:52,045
Turn it down! Yes !

489
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,095
It's good for Jeremy.

490
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:56,197
Jeremy has 
some catching up time for Hunahpu.

491
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:57,422
Caught !

492
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:00,435
The Coyopa have their 3rd bag. 
Attack the puzzle!

493
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:03,168
- The Hunahpu have their 2nd bag. 
- Come on !

494
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:04,223
Go on !

495
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:06,484
- Before ! 
- Jon and Missy

496
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,576
take care of the puzzle at Coyopa.

497
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,251
Hunahpu still doesn't have the 3rd bag.

498
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:14,847
They are exhausted.

499
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:17,234
- Climb ! 
- Come on Wes!

500
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,887
Wes is climbing now.

501
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:22,240
Jon thinks he has the first coin.

502
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,629
Hang it up, guys!

503
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:25,640
Good job guys ! Go Jon!

504
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,279
Cheer. Hook the corner.

505
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,988
Jon hung 
the first piece for Coyopa.

506
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:32,075
Let's go!

507
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,203
The Hunahpu have their third bag.

508
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:38,403
Reed and Josh are going to solve 
the puzzle for Hunahpu.

509
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:39,630
Yes, that's it, that's it!

510
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,497
Missy and Jon work well together.

511
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:44,438
- Let's go! 
- He places the second piece.

512
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:45,980
There are eight rooms in all.

513
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,791
- Come on ! 
- [???]

514
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:51,790
Josh and Reed need to speed up

515
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,508
or it will be the end.

516
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:55,268
Third piece for Jon.

517
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:57,033
Yeah, big Jon!

518
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:58,946
Who is the big Jon now!

519
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,856
The tribe that has dominated since the beginning

520
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:05,468
might get in trouble 
for the first time.

521
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:07,273
- This one. 
- Accelerate, guys!

522
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:08,257
Come on !

523
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:10,776
Jon places a 4th piece for Coyopa.

524
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:12,137
- Nope ! 
- It's not the right one!

525
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:13,685
He must bring her back.

526
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,416
Josh places the first piece.

527
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,847
Yeah, that's it !

528
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:19,729
Reed places a 2nd piece for Hunahpu.

529
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,438
Coyopa is on the fourth.

530
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:22,262
- Do not ! 
- Do not !

531
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,682
It's not good either! 
Coyopa's lead fades.

532
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,102
Josh places the 3rd piece for Hunahpu.

533
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:31,535
- Cheer. 
- They have 3, it's good, continue!

534
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,511
Jon and Missy got it wrong again.

535
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:36,111
The Coyopa are struggling 
to find the right part.

536
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:38,801
- A 4th piece for Josh. 
- Yeah, good!

537
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:40,317
- Hunahpu took the lead. 
- Wait, wait!

538
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:42,442
The Coyopa led all the way,

539
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:45,512
but they crumble 
in the last part,

540
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:47,168
- on the jigsaw. 
- Yeah !

541
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,874
Hunahpu is at five.

542
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:50,958
Coyopa n'en to what trois.

543
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,898
- Its good. 
- Come on Jon!

544
00:29:52,898 --> 00:29:55,071
Josh places another piece 
for Hunahpu.

545
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:57,347
Hunahpu increases his lead.

546
00:29:57,747 --> 00:29:59,027
Yeah, here it is!

547
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,232
Jon places another coin 
for Coyopa.

548
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:02,858
He must hurry!

549
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:05,850
Reed places the 7th piece for Hunahpu.

550
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,607
- Place it! 
- Hurry up, Jon!

551
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:10,133
It would be an incredible comeback 
for Hunahpu.

552
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,000
Come on, Jon, come on!

553
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,614
Reed has the 7th piece.

554
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:16,452
Josh has the last piece for Hunahpu.

555
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:17,894
Hurry up, we're there!

556
00:30:17,894 --> 00:30:18,996
Like that.

557
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:20,392
Is it right ?

558
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:22,492
It is !

559
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:26,540
Hunahpu wins immunity 
once again!

560
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:30,794
We had it!

561
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:31,978
Shit, we had it!

562
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:36,082
It will be fine.

563
00:30:36,871 --> 00:30:38,744
Cheer. I like you.

564
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:41,665
Hunahpu, once again, 
immunity is yours.

565
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,810
Your dominance continues.

566
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,708
- You got it. Really. 
- Nope.

567
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:51,224
Hunahpu, no advice.

568
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,145
No one will leave this group.

569
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,057
Take your things, 
return to camp. Congratulation.

570
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:57,244
- Good boy. 
- Good boy.

571
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:02,996
Coyopa. Who can explain to me 
what you feel?

572
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,750
What happens tonight will be worse.

573
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:08,171
We have all 
already experienced departures,

574
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:13,042
but it will be the departure 
of someone's loved one.

575
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,636
Coyopa, once again 
you return to camp,

576
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:19,024
to try to define 
what you will do tonight.

577
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:21,438
Take your things, on the way. 
See you tonight at the council.

578
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:45,648
Nice team work!

579
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:47,144
It was violent.

580
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,690
We have no respite.

581
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,022
What to do ? Damn, 
we were in on it today.

582
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:57,309
Our emotional fatigue

583
00:31:57,726 --> 00:31:59,746
cause our rout.

584
00:32:00,157 --> 00:32:01,666
It's frustrating.

585
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,564
But now my job

586
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:10,378
is to take out Dale 
and achieve fusion,

587
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,390
to find Wesley there,

588
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,594
and then our pact will be strong.

589
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,649
Is it a good time 
for me to take a nap?

590
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:18,929
Yes, lay down, you deserve it.

591
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:21,159
I also have a backup plan.

592
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:23,297
It's great to have this idol.

593
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:26,223
I can always take it out. 
I don't want to, but I can.

594
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,820
It's the luxury I have.

595
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,134
I suck at this.

596
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:37,328
- In what ? 
- In defeat.

597
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,887
I don't want to 
play my idol tonight.

598
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,773
Good to have it in the merge.

599
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:47,801
I am willing to make a sacrifice 
to achieve fusion.

600
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,917
If I'm not eliminated tonight,

601
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:56,001
as soon as the vote is finished and the torch extinguished,

602
00:32:56,377 --> 00:32:57,720
I will give you my idol.

603
00:32:58,289 --> 00:32:59,260
Wow.

604
00:33:00,507 --> 00:33:02,310
To make sure I reach fusion.

605
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:05,489
At this point, I'm one guy 
against a tribe of five.

606
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:09,452
So I sat down 
with Jon to tell him

607
00:33:09,452 --> 00:33:12,635
that if I didn't go out tonight, 
I would give him my idol.

608
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:15,470
I'm sure 
the idol isn't real.

609
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,383
Playing it would bring me nothing.

610
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:21,246
There, I therefore negotiate it 
against votes.

611
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:22,836
And...

612
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,331
...another torch 
than mine is extinguished,

613
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,297
I'll give you the idol 
before we leave.

614
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,460
- So Missy would be leaving. 
- Yeah.

615
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,023
On the board, I think 
Jon, Jaclyn and I

616
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:35,298
let's eliminate Missy.

617
00:33:35,298 --> 00:33:38,326
She's the one with the most 
ties to the other side.

618
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:41,817
I guarantee it.

619
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:46,745
Dale said 
if he didn't leave tonight,

620
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:49,408
he would give me his immunity idol.

621
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:52,064
Accepting this offer is tempting,

622
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:56,841
but we can't 
stay focused on details,

623
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:59,791
I have to consider 
the puzzle as a whole.

624
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:06,383
He said, 
"I don't want to leave tonight.

625
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:10,574
If I stay, 
I'll give you my idol."

626
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:16,798
We four have to move on.

627
00:34:16,798 --> 00:34:18,354
This is only possible by firing them.

628
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:19,763
- OK. 
- So Dale has an idol.

629
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:21,272
So, three Dale votes.

630
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:22,994
Two Keiths.

631
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:24,346
OK.

632
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,689
In case Dale has this idol,

633
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,436
three people will vote Dale,

634
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:30,349
and Baylor and I will vote Keith.

635
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:32,131
If he plays his idol,

636
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:35,126
Keith leaves. And that saddens me.

637
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:38,185
But better Keith 
than Baylor or me.

638
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:44,840
The interest of following Dale...

639
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,032
The alliance would be you and me...

640
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:49,264
with an idol.

641
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:50,945
Do you think he has it? Frankly ?

642
00:34:50,945 --> 00:34:52,458
I really believe it to be genuine.

643
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,129
Jaclyn and I 
are again in the middle.

644
00:34:57,124 --> 00:35:00,997
We could vote Dale. 
We could fire Keith.

645
00:35:00,997 --> 00:35:02,752
Or we could vote Missy.

646
00:35:08,913 --> 00:35:13,543
The best option seems to me to 
be the alliance with Dale.

647
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:16,662
Then to use the idol 
in the interests of the alliance.

648
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:26,279
But what I have to do 
first and foremost with this vote,

649
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,495
is to position myself 
so that at the time of the merger,

650
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:32,433
Jaclyn and I are 
in a strong position.

651
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:58,870
Dale, today, after the ordeal,

652
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:03,288
you said this vote 
would be worse than defeat,

653
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,373
because you are eliminating 
someone's loved one.

654
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:07,923
I know how it feels.

655
00:36:07,923 --> 00:36:10,560
It's like taking 
a wall in the face.

656
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,636
Since Kelley left, 
I must have slept three hours.

657
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:16,216
The physical part of the game is nice.

658
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:19,450
These are the other 23 hours 
of the day

659
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,811
which empty you.

660
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:23,800
Jon, do you feel that too?

661
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,047
Absolutely, yes.

662
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:26,828
I clearly agree.

663
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,306
Him too.

664
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,377
Howler monkeys agree.

665
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,458
Baylor, you were in exile.

666
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,040
How was your night?

667
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,785
We feel like a kid 
lost in a store

668
00:36:40,785 --> 00:36:43,292
when he no 
longer finds his parents.

669
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:44,475
It's scary, it's rough,

670
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:46,290
and we don't know if we'll hold on.

671
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:49,869
Missy, it must be hard 
to hear her daughter say:

672
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:53,684
"I felt like a little 
girl lost without her mom.".

673
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:56,736
Yeah, it's rough.

674
00:36:56,736 --> 00:37:00,639
This is the moment when we realize 
that we are not there to help.

675
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,856
Baylor, what's happening to you?

676
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,899
When she cries, I cry.

677
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,753
When my father cries, I cry. 
It's a family thing.

678
00:37:09,753 --> 00:37:10,762
But she wasn't crying!

679
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,352
But it will come.

680
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:14,846
And when it starts, 
I'm a fountain.

681
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,346
It's not fair.

682
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:20,996
What is it exactly? 
Because it's so rare to have loved ones here.

683
00:37:20,996 --> 00:37:24,424
And it definitely changes 
the game, completely.

684
00:37:24,424 --> 00:37:27,336
Yeah. I think 
it's knowing

685
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:30,336
that you have someone 
who will love you no matter what.

686
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:34,093
Dale, how is tonight's vote 
different for you,

687
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:35,717
now that Kelley is gone?

688
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:39,017
My game went 
from a long-term strategy

689
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:41,598
to a 12-hour term strategy .

690
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:45,436
Jon, did you feel that? 
Did you feel that Dale was saying:

691
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:47,684
"I'm alive, 
use me if you want."

692
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,241
Yes. Actually, Dale and I 
talked,

693
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:52,408
and this is what he said:

694
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:56,245
"I am ready to do 
what it takes to progress."

695
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:59,116
So yes, I felt it.

696
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:02,116
Jaclyn, if you two are 
indeed in the middle again,

697
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:04,424
someone to tell you:

698
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:06,806
"Use me, 
I'm a free vote!",

699
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,841
it must be very tempting.

700
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:12,962
Yes. It was nice 
to hear another point of view.

701
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:16,122
Missy, this is not good for you.

702
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:18,918
No, neither for me nor for Baylor.

703
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:21,102
It's a bit disconcerting.

704
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:23,745
But at the same time, 
Jeff, from my point of view,

705
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:28,912
I must place my faith 
in those who eliminated my daughter.

706
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:30,980
It's my only choice in the game.

707
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,504
Basically all I have to offer,

708
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:36,614
is that I am loyal, 
alone, an isolated vote,

709
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,219
and that I am not related to 
anyone in the game.

710
00:38:39,793 --> 00:38:42,877
Baylor, a single vote 
can have great value.

711
00:38:42,877 --> 00:38:45,697
I think 
Jon and Jaclyn are very loyal,

712
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:48,924
as Dale says to be. 
But I'm more loyal than him.

713
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:50,998
That's all I can say.

714
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:54,304
Dale, your eyes are gigantic!

715
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:58,177
It is very simple. I like Baylor, 
but she has to assume her game.

716
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:03,095
"Go back to the first day, 
if you want to talk about loyalty,

717
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:05,252
and remember who was there 
and who was not.

718
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:06,522
I know, and it's hard.

719
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:08,995
There is one person 
who has never wronged me,

720
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:12,329
and another that 
more or less betrayed me at first.

721
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:15,046
You have to weigh the pros and cons.

722
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:17,731
Jon, this must influence 
your decision,

723
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,400
to hear what 
happened at the beginning.

724
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,502
Of course it influences him.

725
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:24,145
The merger is coming.

726
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:28,398
I have to know who will be with me, 
who I can trust in the long term.

727
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:30,392
This is what guides tonight's vote.

728
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:35,644
Good. It's time to vote.

729
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:37,137
Keith, over to you.

730
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:58,918
More rain, 
more rain, more rain.

731
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:11,844
I will count the votes.

732
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:20,080
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

733
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,980
now is the time to do it.

734
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:31,564
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

735
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:34,588
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

736
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:35,800
I will read the votes.

737
00:40:47,097 --> 00:40:49,997
One Dale vote, one Missy vote, 
one Keith vote.

738
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,950
Dale. Equality.

739
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:03,055
Two Dale votes, 
two Keith votes, one Missy vote.

740
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:04,586
One vote remains.

741
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:09,186
Sixth person eliminated 
from Survivor: Blood vs. water...

742
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:12,081
Dale. 
Bring me your torch.

743
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:26,194
Dale, the tribe has spoken.

744
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:37,951
You are so Beautiful.

745
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:44,373
You said it was 
the most important vote so far,

746
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:46,457
and that it revolved around loyalty.

747
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:48,557
The question that 
time will answer is:

748
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:50,842
did you make the right decision?

749
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,290
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

752
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:15,987
Next time in Survivor...

753
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:20,695
It's fusion 
in Blood vs. water.

754
00:42:20,695 --> 00:42:22,898
Everyone knows 
the game is on.

755
00:42:22,898 --> 00:42:24,505
And no one is safe.

756
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:26,951
Thanks for helping me. 
Now I have to eliminate you.

757
00:42:26,951 --> 00:42:28,734
He's going to come after each one of us.

758
00:42:28,734 --> 00:42:30,666
If we eliminate it, it's over.

759
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:33,187
I will fight until the end.

760
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:36,232
I did everything I could,

761
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:38,726
when I woke up this morning.

762
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:40,545
I thought I was covered.

763
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:43,088
Jon and Jaclyn did 
the same thing to me as Kelley.

764
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:46,245
I did my best, 
but the battle was hard.

765
00:42:46,872 --> 00:42:50,275
This game was everything 
I hoped for and more.

766
00:42:50,544 --> 00:42:53,318
I can't wait to speak with Kelley. 
We're going to talk for a long time tonight.
