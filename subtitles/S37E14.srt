00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:06,606
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ITS THE "SURVIVOR:

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,775
DAVID VS. GOLIATH" REUNION SHOW.

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:13,079
NICK HAS JUST WON "SURVIVORS"
37th SEASON.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:17,050
YOU KNOW, WE COULDNT REALLY
GUESS THAT WE COULD HAVE A MORE

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,152
PERFECT SEASON FOR YOU TO END UP
AS WINNER.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,823
THIS DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH IDEA,
YOU COME FROM A SMALL TOWN IN

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,726
KENTUCKY, HUMBLE BEGINNINGS,
THERES BEEN TRAGEDY IN YOU

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,764
FAMILY, AND YET IT SEEMED LIKE
DURING THE SHOW ALL THOSE THINGS

9
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,900
THAT HELPED MOLD YOU AND RAISE
YOU WERE ACTUALLY THE SKILLS

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,335
THAT HELPED YOU WIN.

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,770
DID YOU SEE THAT EVOLVING.

12
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,671
YES, I THINK I DID.

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,840
AND, YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO GET ON
THE SHOW FOR SO MANY YEARS, SO

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,576
WHEN WE WERE SITTING ON THE
BARGE AND THEY DROPPED THE THING

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,346
AND THEY SAID, DAVID VERSUS
GRIET, IM THINKING, THIS IS THE

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,115
SEASON I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON.

17
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,316
IT FELT LIKE FATE.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,121
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT I GUESS
MADE THE HUMBLE BEGINNINGS YOU

19
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,357
CALL THEM, THEY DID HELP IN THE
GAME.

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,125
Jeff: I KNOW FROM TALKING
TO YOU, YOU HAD A PERSONAL

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,730
DEBATE, DO I LEAVE THE SMALL
TOWN AND GO TO THE BIG CITY AND

22
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,233
HAVE A BIG CAREER OR STAY IN THE
SMALL TOWN AND TRY TO HELP THE

23
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,235
PEOPLE, MY COMMUNITY.

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,504
DOES THE $1 MILLION IMPACT THAT
DECISION?

25
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,774
I THINK SO, AND, YOU KNOW, I
WANTED TO BE A LAWYER BECAUSE I

26
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:20,447
WANTED TO BE RICH BECAUSE OF THE
WAY I GREW UP.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,249
BUT THEN SOMETHING CHANGED FOR
ME WHERE I FELT LIKE I HAD A

28
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,151
CALLING INSTEAD OF A CAREER.

29
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,888
SO I WENT AND FINALLY MADE IT
BACK HOME TO HELP PEOPLE.

30
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,591
NOW I FEEL LIKE IF MONEY IS NOT
AN OPTION, I DONT HAVE TO TRY

31
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,761
TROY TO WORK FOR A BIG FIRM AND
STAY AT HEM AND DO WHAT I FEEL

32
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,662
LIKE ITS MY CALLING TO DO.

33
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,864
A TRUE DAVID.

34
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,499
Jeff: THANKS, JEFF.

35
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:44,771
MIKE, IN SOME WAYS YOURE
KIND OF THE POLAR OPPOSITE.

36
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:49,008
I MEAN, COMING INTO THIS
GAME,... WELL, MEANING THIS, YOU

37
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,245
HAVE A REALLY BIG, SUCCESSFUL
CAREER, WHICH IS TOUGH TO DO IN

38
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,114
ANY FIELD, ESPECIALLY IN
HOLLYWOOD.

39
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,485
AND YOU HAVE TURNED DOWN A JOB
TO COME PLAY THIS GAME.

40
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,421
WHAT WAS THE DRAW OF "SURVIVOR"?

41
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,657
I THINK AS A WRITER YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU DONT WANT TO SPEND

42
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,392
YOUR WHOLE LIFE JUST OBSERVING
LIFE.

43
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,229
YOU WANT TO JUST LIVE IT, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

44
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:12,732
FOR ME, I DONT WANT THE SPEND
ALL MY CREATE DIFFICULT ON MY

45
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,867
WORK.

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,136
I WANT TO SPEND IT TOWARD
LIVING, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

47
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,872
EVEN IF IT MEANS EMBARRASSING
YOURSELF FROM FRONT OF MILLIONS

48
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,106
OF PEOPLE.

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,942
IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVE TO TAKE A
CHANCE AND LIVE THE ADVENTURE

50
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,713
AND, YOU KNOW, GET OFF... GET
AWAY FROM YOUR COMPUTER.

51
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,282
Jeff: SO A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE THAT FEELING WHEN THEYRE

52
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,650
OUT ON THE ISLAND.

53
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,051
IM ALWAYS GOING TO BE LIKE
THIS.

54
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,020
IM GOING TO TAKE THIS BACK TO
MY REAL LIFE.

55
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,357
SO WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE
PRESSURES OF HOLLYWOOD OR THE

56
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,561
ANXIETY OF A CELL PHONE, WERE
YOU ABLE, HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO

57
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,796
MOLD THIS INTO YOUR LIFE?

58
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,298
I FEEL LIKE I WILL.

59
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,001
I FEEL LIKE WHAT I LEARNED ON
"SURVIVOR" I WILL

60
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,838
DEFINITELY --LY KEEP CHASING THE
ADVENTURE AND ALSO CHASING THESE

61
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,740
PEOPLE HOPEFULLY.

62
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:59,712
Jeff: ANGELINA, LETS COME
DOWN TO YOU.

63
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,847
YEAH.

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,483
Jeff: WE HAVENT HAD
ANYBODY AS POLARIZING AS YOU IN

65
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,684
A WHILE.

66
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:10,123
YOU KNOW, I FELT FOR YOU
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW EVERYBODY...

67
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,959
THE WORLD KNOWS HOW BRUTAL
SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BE.

68
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,127
SO LETS TART THERE.

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,229
HOW HAVE YOU HANDLED ALL THE
CRITICISM THAT CAME YOUR WAY.

70
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:20,967
YEAH, SO, TO BE HONEST, IN
REAL LIFE IM NOT POLARIZING,

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,771
BUT ON "SURVIVOR" YOU ARE JUST
WITH YOUR ESSENTIAL GOODS.

72
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,308
THERE IS A PART OF ME, THERE IS
A BIG SIDE OF ME THAT IS

73
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,043
AGGRESSIVE AND CONFIDENT AND
OUTSPOKEN.

74
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,845
I REALLY LEAKED INTO THAT SIDE
OF MYSELF FOR THE GAME BECAUSE I

75
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,549
WANTED TO JUST PLAY WITH MY
HEART OUT.

76
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,753
I WANTED TO GO FULL STEAM FROM
THE BEGINNING, AND THATS WHAT I

77
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,354
DID.

78
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:41,921
THATS THE GAME I PLAYED.

79
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,756
I CAN BE PROUD OF THAT.

80
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,160
THAT BEING SAID, LIKE YOU
RECOGNIZED, THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT

81
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,529
THERE WHO DONT LIKE TO SEE
THAT.

82
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,498
AND I THINK THAT WERE IN A
REALLY UNIQUE POINT IN TIME

83
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,535
WHERE WOMEN ARE FINDING OUR
VOICE AND WE ARE SPEAKING UP,

84
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,973
AND I AM SO PROUD.

85
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,543
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.

86
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,713
IM SO... ITS BEEN AN HONOR TO
BE ON THE SHOW AN REPRESENT,

87
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:11,384
THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MORE
OF ME MANY THIS COUNTRY.

88
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,885
I THINK TIMES ARE CHANGING.

89
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,654
Jeff: LETS DIG A LITTLE
DEEPER.

90
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:15,922
I AGREE WITH YOU.

91
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,425
I THINK THAT IF A MAN HAD PLAYED
THE EXACT SAME GAME YOU PLAYED,

92
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,562
WE WOULD HAVE LABELED HIM OR
COMMENTED ON HIM VERY

93
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,396
DIFFERENTLY, 100%.

94
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,298
YOU PLAYED AN AGGRESSIVE, SMART
GAME.

95
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:25,932
YOU WENT FOR IT.

96
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,133
THANK YOU.

97
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,570
Jeff: BUT NOW LETS GO INTO
THE PART WHERE I HEARD PEOPLE,

98
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,340
LIKE BRINGING UP THE RICE OR THE
LADDER THAT WAS 100 FEET IN THE

99
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:38,611
AIR, THAT WAS ABOUT EIGHT.

100
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,646
I CLIMBED ABOUT 50.

101
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,280
Jeff: OKAY.

102
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,381
FAIR ENOUGH.

103
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,117
I DONT KNOW HOW YOU GET 50 FROM
AN EIGHT-FOOT RADDER.

104
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,352
BECAUSE I WENT TO THE TOP OF
THE WATERFALL.

105
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,622
Jeff: LET ME REMIND YOU OF
ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS.

106
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,626
LETS LOOK BACK EARLIER IN THE
SEASON.

107
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,596
IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD HAVE
YOUR JACKET?

108
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,265
NATALIE?

109
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,434
Jeff: NATALIE, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

110
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,304
THANK YOU, JEFF.

111
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:04,937
NATALIE.

112
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,273
ITS TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

113
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,342
NOTHING.

114
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:16,316
Jeff: SO MY QUESTION WITH
THAT IS, GIVEN THAT YOU ARE A

115
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,985
STRONG WOMAN AND SHOULDNT BACK
DOWN FROM THAT, WAS THERE ANY

116
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:23,022
SELF-AWARENESS WHEN YOU WATCHED,
MAYBE I PUSHED THE RICE ISSUE A

117
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,157
LITTLE MUCH.

118
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,894
LOOK, NO ONE LAUGHED HARD AT
JACKET-GATE OR THE RICE

119
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,095
SITUATION THAN MYSELF.

120
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,099
I WAS LIKE, PLEASE STOP ASKING
ME SO MANY TIMES, LET NATALIE

121
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,233
GO, LET THE RICE GO.

122
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,337
SO YOU HAVE TO JUST HAVE A GOOD
SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IT.

123
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,640
BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THE MOMENT IT
WAS LIKE, YOU FEEL THE

124
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,443
CREATIVITY, YOU FEEL THE
ADRENALINE, AND YOU JUST LEAN

125
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,644
IN.

126
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,713
IF I WERE TO PLAY AGAIN, I CAN
SEE SOME THINGS I COULD TWEAK

127
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,146
FOR SURE.

128
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,581
Jeff: OKAY.

129
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:53,353
BEFORE WE GO TO BREAK, TAKE ME
BACK TO THIS MOMENT.

130
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,288
WERE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

131
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,757
YOU PLAYED THE IDOL.

132
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,792
THERES NO MORE SECURITY YOU CAN
HAVE IN THE GAME.

133
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:04,397
AND THEN YOU SEE ME DO SOMETHING
UNUSUAL, REACH BACK INTO THE URN

134
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,399
TO PULL OUT THIS ROUND, ODD
DISK.

135
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,567
IT WAS ODD.

136
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,071
?OO WHAT WERE YOU THINKING IN
THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU KNEW

137
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,507
SOMETHING IS AWRY.

138
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,111
FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF WAS
I KNEW IT WAS MY TIME.

139
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,212
YEP, IM DONE.

140
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,280
THERES SOME LOOP, SOME CRAZY
SOMETHING GOING ON HERE.

141
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,949
I WAS HEARTBROKEN, MAN.

142
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,885
AND THEN I WENT IN FULL-ON
SHOCK.

143
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,287
I DONT EVEN REMEMBER YOU
SNUFFING MY TORCH.

144
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,056
Jeff: YOU WERE PART OF AN
HISTORIC MOMENT.

145
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,526
ITS SUCH AN HONOR UPON TART
OF THE HISTORY OF THE GAME.

146
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,761
ITS A BIG DEAL.

147
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,929
Jeff: YOU WERE PART OF THE
GAME IN AN HISTORIC GAME BECAUSE

148
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,633
THE GUY NEXT TO YOU CARL PLAYED
IT PERFECTLY.

149
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:46,272
AND THATS WHY YOU WERE ON THE
JURY, AS WELL.

150
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:50,176
UP NEXT, CHRISTIAN WAS ONE OF
THE BIGGEST UNDERDOGS AND ONE OF

151
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,978
THE MOST POPULAR PLAYERS OF THE
SEASON.

152
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,014
DID HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH GABBY
SURVIVE THE BETRAYAL?

153
00:06:55,047 --> 00:07:02,054
AND NATALIE IS NOT HAPPY ABOUT
HOW SHE WAS PORTRAYED.

154
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,423
WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT.

155
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,192
THE "SURVIVOR" REUNION SHOW
CONTINUES RIGHT AFTER THIS.

156
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,240
Jeff: WELCOME BACK TO
"SURVIVOR: DAVID VS. GOLIATH"

157
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,942
LIVE REUNION SHOW.

158
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,279
CHRISTIAN, SO YOU PLAY THIS GAME
AND YOU BECOME A BIG THREAT AND

159
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:32,285
ITS CLEAR THAT YOURE BECOMING
LIKABLE AND COULD WIN THE GAME.

160
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:37,190
BUT IN THE BEGINNING THAT FIRST
DAY, THERE HAD TO BE A BIG FEAR.

161
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,825
WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR
YOU?

162
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,395
WELL, EARLY ON THE BIGGEST
FEAR IS I WOULD HIT THE BEACH

163
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,996
AND I WOULD BE OSTRACIZED.

164
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,999
I KNOW I WALK AND TALK A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY THAN MOST PEOPLE.

165
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,836
I USE WORDS PEOPLE DONT
TYPICALLY USE, HYPOTHESIS AND

166
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,205
ALSO RITS UMS BEING CHIEF AMONG
THEM.

167
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,840
I DIDNT KNOW.

168
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,108
ITS FINE AT MY ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT AT HOME.

169
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,746
I DIDNT KNOW HOW IT WOULD FLY
WITH THE MAYOR OF SLAMTOWN OR

170
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,316
CARL THE TRUCKER, BUT IT TURNS
OUT REALLY WELL.

171
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,285
I GAINED SOME CONFIDENCE AND
STEAM THROUGHOUT THE GAME.

172
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,489
Jeff: I THINK YOU WERE ONE
OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF IN LIFE

173
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,758
SOMETIMES THESE THINGS THAT WE
THINK OF AS LIABILITIES CAN

174
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:18,097
BECOME ASSETS DEPENDING ON THE
SITUATION, LIKE THE FIVE-HOUR

175
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:24,036
CHALLENGE WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOUR ABILITY TO TALK FOREVER

176
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,241
BECAME THIS -- THAT WAS A VERY
CONSCIOUS DECISION ON YOUR PART,

177
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:28,708
RIGHT?

178
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,644
INDEED IT WAS.

179
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,381
ALSO I NOTICE WHEN I TALK I FEEL
IN PAIN, WHICH IS A NICE SKILL

180
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,217
TO HAVE IN A VERY SPECIFIC SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

181
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,152
AND, TWO YOU KNOW, I HAD YOU
RIGHT THERE.

182
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,989
YOU KNOW, I REALIZED I COULD
TALK TO YOU.

183
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,491
I HAD YOU HELD CAPTIVE FOR SIX
HOURS.

184
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,327
PEOPLE WOULD PAY GOOD MONEY 20
TALK TO YOU FOR THAT LONG, SO

185
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,195
WHY NOT DO IT.

186
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,063
Jeff: WHATS THE BIG
TAKEAWAY?

187
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,001
WHATS THE ANALOGY FOR YOU
PLAYING "SURVIVOR"?

188
00:08:55,034 --> 00:09:00,172
SO, YOU KNOW, "SURVIVOR" IN A
LOT OF WAYS LIKE YOUR

189
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,376
FIRST-EVERY DAY OF SCHOOL WHERE
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT KNOW WHAT

190
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,412
ITS GOING TO BE LIKE, BUT WHEN
YOU SHOW UP IN THE DOOR, THE

191
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,282
DOOR CLOSES BEHIND YOU, THERE
ARE KIDS RUNNING AROUND

192
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,350
EVERYWHERE, YOU REALIZE, I KNOW
NOTHING.

193
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,452
YOUR GAME PLAY GOES OUT THE
WINDOW.

194
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,755
YOU NOTICE THE THINGS YOU
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE GOOD AT

195
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,357
MAYBE ARE YOUR WEAKNESS, BUT
MAYBE THE THINGS YOU THOUGHT

196
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,226
WERE YOUR WEAKNESSES OR ARE YOUR
STRENGTHS.

197
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,264
OR YOUR FRIENDS YOU THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT HAVE, YOU MIGHT FIND

198
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,701
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FRIENDS
LIKE THE BROCHACHOS.

199
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,369
Jeff: SO DONT LIMIT
YOURSELF.

200
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,837
DONT LIMIT YOURSELF.

201
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,273
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED WHAT YOU
CAN DO IF YOU DONT PUT YOURSELF

202
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,311
IN A BOX AND SPREAD YOUR WINGS.

203
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,012
Jeff: NICELY SAID.

204
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,849
GABBY, YOU GUYS HAD ONE OF THE
MOST-TALKED-ABOUT FRIENDSHIPS

205
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,619
EVER ON "SURVIVOR," AND THEN YOU
TURN AND BETRAY EACH OTHER.

206
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,853
DID IT SURVIVE.

207
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,924
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH AS SOON AS
I WAS VOTED OUT I WAS ROOTING

208
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,261
FOR CHRISTIAN TO WIN AND I WAS
SORRY WHEN HE WAS VOTED OUT, BUT

209
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:55,795
WE ARE FRIENDS.

210
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,564
Jeff: GOOD TO HERE.

211
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,068
NATALIE, I HEARD FROM OUR
PRODUCERS THAT YOU ARE NOT HAPPY

212
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,769
ABOUT HOW YOU WERE PORTRAYED.

213
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,371
SO BRING IT TO ME.

214
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,939
WHAT ARE YOU DISPLEASED ABOUT.

215
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,176
JEFF, JEFF, JEFF.

216
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:15,381
I WAS PORTRAYED AS LAZY,
CONFRONTATIONAL, PROBABLY THE

217
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,683
WORST PLAYER EVER, BOSSY.

218
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,152
I OWN THAT ONE.

219
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,089
AND I DIDNT REALLY GET TO SHOW
WHO I REALLY AM.

220
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:27,393
AND SO I THOUGHT WHY AM I BEING
PORTRAYED IN SUCH AN UGLY WAY.

221
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,828
I AM SUCH A FAN OF THE SHOW.

222
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:33,966
I LOVE THE SHOW, AND THEREFORE
WHEN I STARTED TO SEE IT AIR, I

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,534
COULDNT REALLY CELEBRATE BEING
ON THE SHOW.

224
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:40,373
Jeff: WELL, IM BEING
HONEST NOW, THAT HURTS MY HEART,

225
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,008
BECAUSE --
 IT HURTS MY HEART, TOO, JEFF.

226
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,910
Jeff: NUMBER ONE, NATALIE,
I LIKED YOU ON THE SHOW.

227
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,581
I THOUGHT YOU WERE FANTASTIC AT
TRIBAL BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN

228
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,415
OPINION.

229
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,151
YOU WERE WILLING TO SAY WHAT YOU
FELT.

230
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,022
BUT IM GOING TO BE HONEST, THE
WAY I EXPERIENCED YOU AT TRIBAL

231
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,991
IS EXACTLY HOW I SAW IT ON THE
SHOW, AS WELL.

232
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:03,295
SO LETS JUST -- RISKY MOVE
HERE, BUP LETS JUST SEE.

233
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,264
I MAY REGRET THIS QUESTION.

234
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,634
DOES ANYBODY ELSE HERE FEEL WE
JUST COMPLETELY GOT IT WRONG

235
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,339
WITH YOU, WITH YOUR STORY?

236
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,074
WHAT?

237
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,778
Jeff: OKAY.

238
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,712
THEYRE LYING, JEFF.

239
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,181
Jeff: NATALIE, MAYBE YOURE
THE ONLY ONE.

240
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,384
MAYBE WE WERENT ABLE TO --
 CAN I RESPOND TO THAT VERY

241
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,852
QUICKLY?

242
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,087
Jeff: YES.

243
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,424
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL I WAS IN
THE HOT SEAT, SO WHAT YOU SAW AT

244
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,393
TRIBAL COUNCIL IS WHERE I NEEDED
TO BE, BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS ON

245
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,528
THE DEFENSE.

246
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,763
I WAS THE PERSON THAT THEY
WANTED TO TAKE OUT NIGHT ONE.

247
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:41,767
SO MY WHOLE GAME WAS ABOUT
SURVIVING, NOT BEING VOTED OUT

248
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,137
FIRST, AND I WAS COMMITTED TO
THE TO BE FIRST GOLIATH TO GO

249
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,205
OUT.

250
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,908
SO WHAT YOU SAW AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL WAS ME BEING VERY

251
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,143
AGGRESSIVE, VERY ASSERTIVE AND
TRYING TO STAY IN THE GAME.

252
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:51,977
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

253
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,482
WELL, WE DIDNT SEE ALL THE
FLAVORS(

254
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,452
ANYBODY WHO MIGHT QUESTION THE
REALNESS, I THINK THIS SHOWS IT

255
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,822
IS REAL, VERY TRANSPARENT, WE
ALWAYS WANT TO BE HONEST, HERES

256
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,890
ANOTHER SOMETHING THAT SPEAKS TO
THAT.

257
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,526
HERE IS THE WEIGHT LOSS WE HAD
THIS YEAR.

258
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,931
JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW HARD IT IS
TO LIVE ON RICE.

259
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,735
KARA LOST 26 POUNDS.

260
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,538
DAN LOST 26 MORE POUNDS.

261
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,674
ALISON LOST 27 POUNDS.

262
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:30,549
AND DAVIE LOST 36 POUNDS.

263
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,253
AND WHATS CRAZY IS NOBODY CAME
CLOSE TO THE RECORD THAT THIS

264
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:38,657
GUY SET BACK IN OUR THIRD
SEASON, THATS BIG TOM BAKK IN

265
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,525
2001.

266
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,729
HE WOULD GO ON TO LOSE NEARLY 80
POUNDS.

267
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,665
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS AFTER A PLAYER IS VOTED

268
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,068
OUT, CHECK OUT OUR PONDEROSA
EPISODES.

269
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,503
THEY LIVE ONLINE.

00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,370
THEYRE REALLY COOL.

271
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,205
GREAT STUFF IF YOURE A
"SURVIVOR" FAN.

272
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,540
WELL TAKE QUICK BREAK.

273
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:58,043
WHEN WE COME BACK, WELL SEE HOW
PAT IS DOING AFTER HIS MEDICAL

274
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,747
EVACUATION AND WERE GOING TO
TELL YOU WHAT "SURVIVOR" IS

275
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,617
DOING NEXT SEASON.

276
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,461
Jeff: WELL, THIS SEASON THE
PLAYERS HAD TO ENDURE SOME

277
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,298
REALLY TOUGH CONDITION,
INCLUDING TWO SIGH CLONES THAT

278
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,101
RESULTED IN US HAVING TO
EVACUATE THEM AND A FREAK

279
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:27,606
OCCURRENCE ON A BOAT LED TO A
VERY SCARY MOMENT FROM PAT.

280
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,341
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THIS FROM
EPISODE ONE.

281
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,445
PAT WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN AND
ULTIMATELY HAD TO BE MEDICALLY

282
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,647
EVACUATED.

283
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,282
PAT, YOU LOOK GOOD RIGHT NOW.

284
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,550
I FEEL GREAT, JEFF.

285
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,450
Jeff: ARE YOU BACK?

286
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,553
I FEEL GREAT, JEFF.

287
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,723
IM READY TO GO BACK IF YOURE
READY FOR ME TO MAKE THE CALL.

288
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,325
Jeff: IM READY FOR YOU.

00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,662
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE, DID

YOURE TRUSTING US TO TAKE CARE
OF YOU MEDICALLY.

294
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:00,673
JEFF, THE MEDICAL TEAM AND
EVERYBODY ON THE BEACH THAT DAY,

295
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:05,277
ITS TRULY HEARTWARMING TO KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU GUYS CARE ABOUT THE

296
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,778
CONTESTANTS.

297
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,879
ITS A GREAT FAMILY.

298
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,613
Jeff: GREAT.

299
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,781

GROUP OF PLAYERS WILL TAKE ON

304
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:27,499
THE GREATEST SOCIAL EXPERIMENT
EVER CREATED.

305
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,236
IF I WANT TO DO SOMETHING, I
JUST DO IT.

306
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,837
IM NOT GOING TO STAY HERE FOR
39 DAYS AND PLAY A BORING GAME.

307
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,975
I RATHER GET VOTED OFF IN A
BLAZE OF GLORY.

308
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:36,976
IM READY TO GO.

309
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,812
IM A MORNING NEWS ANCHOR IN
MACON, GEORGIA.

310
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,347
IM A HUGE FAN OF THE SHOW.

311
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,582
IM GOING TO COME INTO THE GAME
LIKE THE COOL MAN.

312
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,684
I WANT TO BREAK THROUGH THE
WALL.

313
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,886
OH, YEAH.

314
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,089
Jeff: THEYLL BE JOINED BY
FOUR RETURNING PLAYERS.

315
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,558
THIS GAME WILL TAKE
EVERYTHING FROM YOU, BUT YOU

316
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,394
ALSO HAVE TO GIVE EVERYTHING TO
THE GAME.

317
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:59,031
THERE ARE ARCHETYPES LIKE ME
THAT PEOPLE SAY WILL NEVER WIN.

318
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,332
IM GOING THE PROVE THEM WRONG.

319
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,401
THIRD TIMES THE CHARM, BABY.

320
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,837
I KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS GOING
TO BE.

321
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,105
I CAN BE STARVING.

322
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,373
IT CAN BE POURING.

323
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,440
BUT IM HERE FOR THE WIN.

324
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,808
THATS WHAT I WANT.

325
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,409
LY NEVER QUIT.

326
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,645
I AM FREAKING DETERMINED.

327
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:18,918
Jeff: AND A NEW LAYER TO
THE GAME WILL PUSH THEM FURTHER

328
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,985
THAN EVER BEFORE.

329
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,488
WHERE IS MY GAME GOING TO GO
FROM HERE?

330
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,124
YOURE SEW ALONE.

331
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,558
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF, DONT
QUIT.

332
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,828
ITS JUST REALLY HARD.

333
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,032
I DONT KNOW IF I CAN DO
THIS.

334
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:39,204
IM NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP.
