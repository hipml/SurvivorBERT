1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:04,087
>> Jeff:
PREVIOUSLY ON<i> SURVIVOR,</i>

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,797
DID YOU EVER HAVE
ONE OF THOSE DAYS

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,965
WHERE EVERYTHING GOES WRONG?

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,260
WELCOME TO SASH'S WORLD.

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,219
AFTER FOUR WEEKS IN THE JUNGLE,

6
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,555
SASH HAD IT ALL.

7
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,556
>> I LOVE HAVING THE POWER
IN THIS GAME.

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,475
>> Jeff: A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
IN HIS POCKET,

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,894
HIS CLOSEST ALLY NAONKA
HAD ANOTHER ONE,

10
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,312
AND THE THIRD PERSON
IN HIS CLIQUE,

11
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,273
PURPLE KELLY,
DID WHATEVER HE SAID.

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,608
>> I'M NOT AS WISE
AS SOME OF THESE PEOPLE,

13
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,110
BUT AS LONG
AS I KEEP SASH CLOSE,

14
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,237
I THINK I'LL BE FINE.

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,114
>> Jeff: THE SASH TRAIN WAS
IN PERFECT POSITION

16
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,907
TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

17
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,617
>> I HOLD MORE CHIPS
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

18
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,286
>> Jeff:
AND THEN THE WHEELS CAME OFF.

19
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,956
FIRST NAONKA GAVE HER IDOL
TO CHASE.

20
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,125
>> I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION
TOO MUCH ABOUT MY IDOL.

21
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,460
I'M JUST GOING
TO KIND OF LAY LOW,

22
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,462
BUT I'M NOT PLANNING
ON PLAYING IT.

23
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,630
>> Jeff: THEN AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

24
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,591
BOTH NAONKA AND PURPLE KELLY

25
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,258
THREW IN THE TOWEL.

26
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,302
>> I'M GOING TO QUIT.

27
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,595
>> I'M GOING TO QUIT.

28
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,305
>> Jeff: THAT MEANS
THE REST OF YOU

29
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,266
JUST MOVED UP TWO NOTCHES

30
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,435
AND DIDN'T HAVE
TO VOTE ANYBODY OUT.

31
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,353
NOW THERE ARE TWO ALLIANCES,

32
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,148
CHASE, HOLLY AND JANE
ON ONE SIDE,

33
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,650
BENRY, FABIO AND DAN
ON THE OTHER.

34
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,651
WANT TO GO?

35
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,652
>> YES.

36
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,363
>> Jeff: GO.

37
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,365
HEAD OUT.

38
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,284
SEVEN ARE LEFT.

39
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,286
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

40
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,834
>> AND THEN THERE WERE SEVEN.

41
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,376
>> YEAH.

42
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,377
>> THERE'S THE FIRE.

43
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,963
IF WE CAN GET THAT STARTED,

44
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:29,672
YOU GUYS CAN SEE.

45
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,801
WE HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

46
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,135
BECAUSE OF THEM,

47
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,845
SIT THERE AND GET WET

48
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,387
AND NOW HERE WE ARE WET,

49
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,848
AND THEY'RE ALL DRY.

50
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,142
TONIGHT WE HAD A TRIBAL COUNCIL,

51
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,229
AND NAONKA AND KELLY

52
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,689
DECIDED TO QUIT.

53
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,568
20 PEOPLE OUT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE

54
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,194
ARE GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY,

55
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,364
AND 11 DAYS LEFT,

56
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,032
AND THEY WALK OUT.

57
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:59,035
UNBELIEVABLE.

58
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,328
>> IS THERE AN EGG TODAY?

59
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,996
>> NO.

60
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,832
>> HAVE WE GIVEN HER NAME YET?

61
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,041
>> WE SHOULD NAME HER...

62
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,417
KELLY-NAY.

63
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,420
'CAUSE THEY'RE BOTH CHICKEN.

64
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,340
>> WE'LL HAVE
TO BRING THAT UP AT TRIBAL.

65
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,759
WE NAMED OUR CHICKEN KELLY-NAY,

66
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:19,722
AFTER YOU CHICKENS.

67
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,725
>> FOR EVERYONE IN THE TRIBE,

68
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,185
LOSING TWO WAS A HUGE PLUS.

69
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,856
PROBABLY THE PERSON
THAT DID NOT BENEFIT THE MOST

70
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,358
WAS ME BECAUSE CHASE,

71
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,361
HE'S ALIGNED TIGHTLY
WITH HOLLY AND JANE,

72
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,447
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE SPECTRUM

73
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,242
IS DAN, FABIO AND BENRY,

74
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,536
WHO HAVE ALSO FORMED
A CLOSE ALLIANCE.

75
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,789
NOW, I HAVE
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,

76
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,499
SO I STILL THINK THE ODDS
ARE IN MY FAVOR

77
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
TO TRY AND MAKE A RUN FOR IT,

78
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,838
BUT IT'S GONNA BE MORE DIFFICULT
THAN WHAT I THOUGHT.

79
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,817
>> YOU KNOW,
ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M SAYING

80
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,360
IS THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

81
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,945
I'M DEFINITELY PLAYING THE IDOL.

82
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,572
I THINK THE IDOL RIGHT NOW

83
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,115
MAY BE PUTTING TARGET
ON MY BACK.

84
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:19,699
SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO

85
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,451
IS JUST GET RID OF IT

86
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,454
AND HOPEFULLY
THAT WILL SHOW EVERYONE

87
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,080
I'M KIND OF LIKE A FREE AGENT

88
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,457
AND WHOEVER WANTS MY VOTE

89
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,126
TO TRY AND GET THEM FURTHER,

90
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,419
IT'S KIND OF UP FOR GRABS

91
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,546
BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT,

92
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,756
YOU KNOW,
WHAT THEIR END GAME IS,

93
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,591
BUT I THINK IT'S THE SAFEST MOVE

94
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,843
FOR ME, PERSONALLY,
TO JUST PLAY IT RIGHT NOW.

95
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,053
GET RID OF IT.

96
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,638
I'M NO LONGER A THREAT
TO THE FUTURE,

97
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,139
AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL KEEP ME
AROUND LONGER.

98
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,140
>> MAKES SENSE.

99
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:44,974
>> I JUST WANT TO BE UP FRONT.

100
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,601
RIGHT NOW IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL
GAME.

101
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,771
SO I REALLY HAVE TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

102
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,272
I'M A SWING VOTE.

103
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,566
NO MATTER WHO I ALIGN WITH,

104
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,860
I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE
THE NUMBER-FOUR MAN,

105
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,487
SO PRETTY MUCH MAKE ME
YOUR BEST OFFER,

106
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,530
AND I'LL DECIDE THEN.

107
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,824
>> MY THING IS,

108
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,660
AND I'VE SAID IT
FROM THE BEGINNING,

109
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,828
I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME
WITH PEOPLE THAT I TRUST,

110
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,996
AND I DID THAT.

111
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,664
YOU KNOW,
I'VE DONE THAT WITH YOU.

112
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,540
I'VE DONE THAT WITH BRENDA.

113
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,167
UNFORTUNATELY WE COULDN'T KEEP
BRENDA IN THE GAME.

114
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,126
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

115
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,836
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY
IN OUR BEST INTEREST

116
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,379
TO GO WITH THE WOMEN,
ABSOLUTELY.

117
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,463
>> RIGHT.

118
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,508
AND, YOU KNOW, THEN,

119
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,592
YOU KNOW, IDEALLY IT COMES DOWN

120
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,178
TO FOUR OF US,

121
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,429
AND I THINK THE ONLY PERSON

122
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,891
THAT COULD BEAT YOU
AT THE END IS JANE.

123
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,854
IF BY SOME REASON,

124
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,232
JANE MAKES IT TO THE END,

125
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,233
YOU STILL TAKE ME,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

126
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,234
>> OH, YEAH.

127
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,235
>> YEAH, OKAY.

128
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,695
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

129
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,864
>> ANOTHER THING THAT YOU'RE
LUCKY ABOUT RIGHT NOW,

130
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,658
YOU AND HOLLY WILL ABSOLUTELY

131
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,409
BE GOING ON SOME SICK REWARDS,
SO YOU KNOW.

132
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,577
>> I HOPE SO.

133
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,705
>> YOU WILL,
'CAUSE YOU MISSED OUT YESTERDAY.

134
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,665
SHE DEFINITELY WILL GO
ON THE NEXT ONE.

135
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,208
>> OH, YEAH, I MEAN,

136
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,670
MY THING IS IF ANYONE WINS NEXT,

137
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,046
I THINK THEY SHOULD TAKE HOLLY

138
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,256
BECAUSE SHE DESERVES IT
THE MOST.

139
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,217
>> I THINK YOU ARE NEXT IN LINE
FOR THE REWARDS.

140
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,218
>> WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.

141
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,387
>> LET'S SHAKE ON IT,
LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

142
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,388
100%.

143
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,389
YOU KNOW I'M GOOD FOR THAT.

144
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,223
>> OKAY.

145
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,891
>> I REALLY NEED A REWARD
RIGHT NOW,

146
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,517
ESPECIALLY SOME FOOD.

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,728
I AM LITERALLY STARVING,

148
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,688
AND ASIDE FROM HOLLY,

149
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,400
I'VE GONE THE LONGEST
WITHOUT A FOOD REWARD RECENTLY,

150
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,236
SO I'M KEEPING
MY FINGERS CROSSED

151
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,238
THAT THERE'S SOME FOOD
ON THE HORIZON.

152
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,452
>> Jeff: COME ON, IN GUYS.

153
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,253
DAY 30.

154
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,421
YOU'VE MADE IT 30 DAYS.

155
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,590
NICE WORK, YOU GUYS.

156
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,591
>> THANKS.

157
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,592
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

158
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,886
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
A SECOND CHANCE

159
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,722
TO REVISIT SOME
OF THE CHALLENGES FROM THE PAST.

160
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,140
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

161
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,475
ON MY GO YOU'LL RACE
THROUGH A MUD PIT,

162
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,603
THEN DIG THROUGH A PILE
OF HAY TO RETRIEVE A BALL.

163
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,605
YOU'LL BOUNCE THE BALL
OFF A SHIELD INTO A BARREL.

164
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,607
FIRST FOUR PEOPLE

165
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,901
TO GET THEIR BALL
IN THEIR BARREL

166
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,319
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.

167
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,112
IN THIS ROUND YOU'LL USE A STICK

168
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,073
TO RETRIEVE A KEY
HANGING OVERHEAD.

169
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,449
THE KEY UNLOCKS A CHEST

170
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,617
THAT CONTAINS FOUR SAND BAGS.

171
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,079
YOU'LL THEN ATTEMPT
TO LAND YOUR SAND BAGS

172
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,955
ON TOP OF A BARREL.

173
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,416
THE FIRST TWO PEOPLE

174
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,293
TO GET ALL THEIR SAND BAGS
ON THE BARREL

175
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,920
MOVE ON TO THE FINAL ROUND.

176
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,129
IN THE FINAL ROUND,

177
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,089
YOU'LL HAVE A PADDLE.

178
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,466
YOU'LL USE IT TO DIG UP
THREE ROPE RINGS.

00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,656
>> EASY DECISION. HOLLY.

283
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,533
SHE GAVE UP REWARD LAST TIME.

284
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,659

>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, CHASE.

288

ONE MORE SPOT.

289
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,879
IN CHOOSING ONE PERSON,

290
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,089
YOU LEAVE FOUR BEHIND.

291
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,717
>> I LOVE YOU GUYS,

292
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,761
BUT I FEEL LIKE

293
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,763
I HAVE TO TAKE JANE.

294
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,765
I LOVE YOU GUYS TO DEATH,

295
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,100
AND I APOLOGIZE.

296
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,020
>> Jeff: SASH, DAN,
FABIO, BENRY,

297
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,021
GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

298
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,731
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK THE CAMP.

299
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,857
>> CHASE ACTUALLY SAID TO ME

300
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,360
NEXT REWARD IF HE WINS IT,

301
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,944
HE'S GOING TO TAKE ME ON IT.

302
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,904
RIGHT NOW IT COULD GO
EITHER WAY.

303
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,906
CHASE KNOWS I HAVE AN IDOL,

304
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,909
SO FOR HIM TO MAKE
THAT RISKY OF A MOVE

305
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,287
WHEN YOU HE PROBABLY ALREADY HAS
JANE'S VOTE LOCKED UP,

306
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,207
IS INCREDIBLY STUPID.

307
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,274
>> YEAH, TRUE.

308
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:32,900
A LITTLE EXTRA ROOM

309
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,111
IN THE SHELTER TONIGHT.

310
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,779
>> DUDE,
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

311
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,947
IT WORKED OUT, MAN.

312
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,951
CHASE PICKED THE TWO
LEAST STRATEGIC PEOPLE

313
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,494
TO GO WITH HIM.

314
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:47,248
>> WITH CHASE CHOOSING JANE
AND HOLLY TO GO ON THE REWARD,

315
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,127
HE WAS NOT ONLY PROBABLY MAKING

316
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,212
ONE OF THE DUMBEST MOVES
IN THE GAME THUS FAR

317
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:53,963
BY LEAVING ME,

318
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,799
WHO IS REALLY A WILD CARD,

319
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,010
BACK AT CAMP TO POSSIBLY
MANEUVER MYSELF

320
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,011
WITH THE OTHER ALLIANCE,

321
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,974
BEING BENRY, FABIO AND DAN.

322
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,767
>> I JUST WANT TO BE UP FRONT.

323
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,853
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE.

324
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,939
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT

325
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,150
THERE'S A THREE-THREE SPLIT,

326
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,861
AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

327
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,821
BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS
I'M GOING TO BE

328
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,989
THE NUMBER FOUR MAN

329
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,073
ON ANY THREE-PERSON ALLIANCE.

330
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,826
SO, YOU KNOW,

331
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,995
LET'S JUST REALLY THINK
ABOUT IT TODAY

332
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,330
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
TO NOT ONLY GET THEM OFF,

333
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,623
BUT, YOU KNOW,

334
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,667
WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT

335
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,169
ALL THE WAY TO THE FINAL FOUR.

336
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,336
>> YEAH, YEAH.

337
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,004
>> IF WE GET THOSE THREE OFF,

338
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,006
US FOUR GO.

339
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,134
>> BUT ONLY THREE OR TWO

340
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,802
MAKE IT TO FINAL TRIBAL,

341
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,096
SO I JUST WANT TO HEAR

342
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,181
YOUR GAME PLAN
AND YOUR STRATEGY.

343
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,350
>> SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU
MIGHT SIDE WITH THEM?

344
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,019
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

345
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,021
IS THAT YOU MIGHT SIDE
WITH THEM.

346
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,315
>> HONESTLY, NONE OF YOU
HAVE COME FORWARD

347
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,858
AND TOLD ME YOUR GAME PLAN YET.

348
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,694
>> IT KEEPS CHANGING EVERY DAY.

349
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,362
>> FROM HERE ON OUT,

350
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,573
I WANT YOU TO FEEL FREE
TO TELL ME

351
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,325
WHATEVER YOU WANT INSTEAD OF,
YOU KNOW,

352
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,035
US SAYING ONE THING

353
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,036
AND GOING BACK.

354
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,079
I TRUST EVERYONE HERE.

355
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,915
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO TRUST YOU

356
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,708
TO NOT GO BACK ON YOUR WORD.

357
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,876
>> OF COURSE.

358
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,754
>> WE TRIED TO GET SASH
BACK IN WITH US,

359
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,173
AND WE APPROACHED HIM
AND HE SAID,

360
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,674
"I'M WITH YOU GUYS,
I'M WITH YOU GUYS,

361
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,926
I'M WITH YOU GUYS,
I'M WITH YOU GUYS,"

362
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,554
BUT PEOPLE DON'T TRUST SASH,

363
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,555
AND THEY'RE CRAZY IF THEY DO

364
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,016
AFTER WHAT HE DID
TO HIS OWN RIGHT-HAND GIRL,

365
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,768
AND AFTER WHAT HE DID TO BRENDA

366
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,936
AND AFTER WHAT HE DID TO MARTY.

367
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,689
BUT IF SASH GOES WITH CHASE

368
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,106
AND THE TWO LADIES,

369
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,526
THEY HAVE FOUR.

370
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,069
WE ONLY HAVE THREE.

371
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,571
SO I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO TRUST SASH.

372
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,118
>> WATERMELON.

373
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,079
>> A TOAST.

374
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,247
>> A TOAST.

375
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,289
HERE WE GO.

376
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,208
>> GREAT JOB.

377
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,417
>> TO A WONDERFUL DAY.

378
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:55,960
THANK YOU, CHASE,
FOR PICKING ME.

379
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,379
OVERNIGHT MASSAGES

380
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,922
WITH THE TWO OLDEST LADIES
LEFT ON<i> SURVIVOR.</i>

381
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,840
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

382
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,717
>> I'M IN GOOD COMPANY.

383
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,343
>> CHASE WON,

384
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,554
AND I WAS SO MUCH PRAYING

385
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:06,971
THAT CHASE WOULD PICK ME.

386
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,265
A TIKI HUT!

387
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,058
I ALWAYS WANTED TO LIVE
IN A TIKI HUT.

388
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,436
AREN'T TIKI HUTS AWESOME?

389
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,438
>> THE WAY THE LITTLE TIKI HUT
WAS BUILT

390
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,523
WAS REALLY COOL

391
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,276
BECAUSE WE HAD A LITTLE
OUTSIDE BATHROOM AMENITIES.

392
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,735
WOW, LOOK OUT HERE!

393
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,613
>> LOOK HOW MUCH FREAKING
WEIGHT I'VE LOST.

394
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,781
>> LOOK AT YOUR BEARD.

395
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,324
LOOK HOW SKINNY YOU ARE.

396
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,576
>> I KNOW.

397
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,868
I'M LIKE A RACK OF BONES.

398
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,120
>> SOAP!

399
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,581
>> OH, WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

400
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,292
LOOK AT THAT, AN OUTDOOR SHOWER.

401
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,502
>> I MEAN, IT WAS JUST AWESOME.

402
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,212
>> GO, HOLLY, GO,
HOLLY'S STRIPPING.

403
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,464
GIRL, GO!

404
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,675
>> CHASE PICKED JANE AND ME

405
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,217
TO GO ON THE REWARD,

406
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,093
LEAVING SASH BEHIND.

407
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,804
I JUST KIND OF WENT, OH, NO,

408
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,848
AND I THOUGHT HE MADE

409
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,932
THE WRONG CHOICE.

410
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,643
>> HOLLY, WE GOT TO TALK.

411
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,146
I REALLY SCREWED UP TODAY

412
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,314
PICKING JANE.

413
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,189
>> I'M NOT GOING TO LIE,

414
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,817
YOU DID.

415
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,320
>> YOU SHOULD'VE WHISPERED TO ME

416
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,654
OR SOMETHING.

417
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,155
SORRY, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

418
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,699
THE PROBLEM IS NOW

419
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,992
THEY'RE GOING
TO BE GUNNING FOR US.

420
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,118
IF THEY HAVE FOUR,

421
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,494
THEY'RE GOING
TO BE GUNNING FOR THREE OF US.

422
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,495
>> I AGREE.

423
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,496
>> I'M SO STUPID

424
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,789
FOR NOT PICKING SASH.

425
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,166
>> IF HE GOES WITH THAT GROUP,

426
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,044
IT'S GOING TO BE JANE,
YOU AND ME.

427
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,670
THAT'S THE PECKING ORDER

428
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,671
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO.

429
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,839
IT'S GOING TO BE
THE THREE OF US

430
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:24,715
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

431
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,967
WE NEED TO TALK LATER
JUST YOU AND I.

432
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,053
>> I'VE BEEN A LITTLE FLIGHTY

433
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,763
THROUGHOUT THE GAME,

434
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,014
NOT MAKING DECISIONS

435
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:32,848
AND STICKING WITH THEM,

436
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,725
WHICH COULD COME BACK
TO HURT ME.

437
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,601
IT'S MISTAKES THAT I'M MAKING.

438
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,561
I DON'T NEED TO BE DOING THAT
TOO MUCH

439
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,979
BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE
STOP TRUSTING ME.

440
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,190
NOW SASH IS BACK AT CAMP
WITH BENRY, FABIO AND DAN.

441
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,484
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

442
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,612
THEY COULD FORGE ONE UP
AND PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE.

443
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,364
I GOT TO GET BACK
TO CAMP TOMORROW

444
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,366
AND FIGURE OUT
WHERE SASH'S HEAD IS AT.

445
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,158
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

446
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,702
>> I LOVE MASSAGES.

447
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,204
>> I'M GOING TO ENJOY
THIS REWARD

448
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,040
WHILE I'M HERE AND TRY
TO DO DAMAGE CONTROL TOMORROW.

449
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,339
>> I DON'T WANT SASH TO THINK

450
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,007
THAT HE CAN GO WITH CHASE.

451
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,759
I WANT, YOU KNOW,

452
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,552
WE DEFINITELY WANT SASH TO THINK

453
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,262
HE HAS NO WAY OF GETTING TO THE
FINAL THREE

454
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,222
IF HE GOES WITH CHASE
AND THOSE GIRLS.

455
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,058
>> TRUST ME,
HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM.

456
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,810
>> NOT ONLY ARE HOLLY AND CHASE

457
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,144
A BIG THREAT TO SASH,

458
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,270
NOBODY WANTS TO GO

459
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,855
TO THE FINAL THREE
WITH JANE ANYWAY.

460
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,273
SO I THINK IF SASH WERE SMART,

461
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,441
HE'D MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION

462
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,859
AND JUMP ON BOARD WITH US

463
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,111
AND TAKE HIMSELF A LOT FURTHER
IN THIS GAME.

464
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,154
>> HEY, DINNER.

465
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,786
>> DO YOU GUYS THINK

466
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,037
JANE WILL BE UPSET

467
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:37,579
WE KILLED HER CHICKEN

468
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,123
AND ATE IT WITHOUT HER?

469
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,249
>> HER CHICKEN?

470
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,750
>> I THINK THE ALLIANCES

471
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,043
WERE REALLY DEFINED TODAY.

472
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,920
WE CAN REALLY USE SASH

473
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,588
TO OUR ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME.

474
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,924
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE
ANY CHANCES.

475
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,092
THAT KID HAS BEEN SHIFTY

476
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,136
THIS ENTIRE GAME

477
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,595
AND HASN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE

478
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,888
TO MAKE UP HIS MIND.

479
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,889
SO I HAVE A FEELING

480
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,432
HE'S STILL IN THE SAME BOAT

481
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,141
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME

482
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,601
HE'S A LOT CLOSER TO HOLLY,

483
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,271
JANE AND CHASE THAN DAN,
FABIO AND I.

484
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,606
>> KELLY-NAY.

485
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,192
>> KELLY-NAY NO LONGER.

486
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,540
(FLIES BUZZING)

487
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,968
>> THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO EAT HER.

488
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:37,973
I MEAN,
THEY GOT ENOUGH RICE HERE

489
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,977
FOR 20 DAYS PROBABLY.

490
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,521
I DID LOVE MY CHICKEN.

491
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,565
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO EAT HER.

492
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,197
ANYWAY, I FOUND OUT
WHEN I GOT BACK

493
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,865
THEY DID KILL THE CHICKEN,

494
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,325
SO I MADE HER
A LITTLE MEMORIAL OVER THERE

495
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,702
AND MADE HER A LITTLE CROSS,

496
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,370
A LITTLE HEART SHAPE

497
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,872
OUT OF THE LITTLE SHELLS

498
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,499
FROM THE HERMIT CRABS

499
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,209
THAT I MADE

500
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,668
AND TOLD HER A LITTLE PRAYER

501
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,670
AND CRIED OVER HER
AND WENT DOWN TO THE BEACH

502
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,505
AND WAS SAD FOR A LITTLE BIT.

503
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,466
YOU KNOW, I KNEW
IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,

504
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,343
BUT HAD I NOT WON
THAT REWARD CHALLENGE,

505
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,512
I WAS GOING TO TAKE HER DOWN
IN THE WOODS

506
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,304
AND RUN WITH HER AND HIDE.

507
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,850
>> I JUST DON'T TRUST SASH,

508
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,018
YOU GUYS, I'M SORRY.

509
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,603
I'M JUST GONNA BE HONEST
WITH YOU GUYS.

510
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,771
>> WHAT DO WE DO THEN?

511
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,480
>> YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THESE GUYS WERE TOGETHER

512
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,607
ALL DAY YESTERDAY, ALL NIGHT,

513
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,025
AND NOW THEY'RE TOGETHER.

514
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,485
>> HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

515
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,530
WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM THINK
WE TRUST HIM.

516
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,198
WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM THINK,

517
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,908
NO MATTER WHAT,

518
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,243
THAT YOU AND I WILL TAKE HIM

519
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,369
TO THE FINALS AND DROP HER.

520
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,412
WE NEED TO MAKE SASH THINK
100% THAT HE'S...

521
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,040
SEE IF HE'S STILL WITH US,

522
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,208
WHICH HE'LL SAY HE IS,

523
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,377
AND WE'LL FIND OUT

524
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,711
IN THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

525
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,421
YEAH, IT WAS
AN UNBELIEVABLE MISTAKE I MADE.

526
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,130
I LEFT SASH BACK AT CAMP,

527
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,674
THE PERSON I COULD TRUST LEAST

528
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,466
BACK AT CAMP
WITH THREE OTHER GUYS

529
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,509
THAT ARE WAITING
TO POUNCE ON HIM.

530
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,885
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

531
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,929
DAMN, THEY'RE ALL TALKING
TO HIM.

532
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,222
I KNEW THEY WERE TALKING TO HIM.

533
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,598
IF SASH GOES WITH THEM,

534
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,767
THEN IT'S GOING TO BE ME,
HOLLY AND JANE

535
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,893
FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES

536
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,061
AND IT'S GOING TO BE HELL.

537
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:06,645
IT'S GOING TO BE A FIGHT
TO THE FINISH

538
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,355
IF SASH GOES WITH THEM.

539
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,190
>> LOOK AT THESE
FRESH-LOOKING LADIES.

540
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,275
HOW WAS IT?

541
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,694
>> IT WASN'T EVEN A SHOWER.

542
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,403
>> IT HAD A WATER FAUCET.

543
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,407
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

544
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,911
>> I GOT UP FROM THE TABLE,

545
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,413
I GOT UP FROM THE TABLE...

546
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,582
>> CHASE, HOLLY AND JANE

547
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,875
GOT BACK FROM THEIR REWARD,

548
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,209
AND, YOU KNOW,

549
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,544
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAD
A GREAT TIME,

550
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,587
BUT I'M NERVOUS.

551
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,713
I'M NERVOUS.

552
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,714
THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABLES

553
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,424
THAT COULD PLAY
INTO THIS RIGHT NOW

554
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,592
THAT ARE PRETTY DANGEROUS

555
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,927
JUST IN TERMS OF MY NAME BEING
BROUGHT UP

556
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,387
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK

557
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,347
JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

558
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,932
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHERE I STAND RIGHT NOW.

559
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,976
I'M DEFINITELY
A PHYSICAL THREAT, AS WELL.

560
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:51,481
>> NO, NO. NOPE.

561
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,547
>> I HAVEN'T TRUSTED BENRY
THIS ENTIRE GAME.

562
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,299
I THINK DAN, BEN AND FABIO
ARE GUNNING FOR JANE,

563
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,510
BUT I ALSO THINK THEY'RE GUNNING
FOR ME, AS WELL.

564
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,511
SO I'M DEFINITELY WORRIED

565
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,305
THAT SASH WOULD LEAVE US
AND GO WITH THOSE GUYS,

566
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,807
BUT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO
MY DAMN BEST

567
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,768
TO MAKE SURE HE FEELS
REAL GOOD WITH OUR CREW.

568
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,312
>> SORRY I DIDN'T
TAKE YOU YESTERDAY, MAN.

569
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,273
>> OH, NO.

570
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,316
HOLLY DESERVED IT.

571
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,486
WE ALL WOULD HAVE TAKEN HOLLY,

572
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,654
YOU KNOW,

573
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,656
AND I WAS JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS

574
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,490
WHEN YOU BROUGHT JANE WITH YOU,

575
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,201
JUST BECAUSE...

576
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,328
>> I VERY MUCH REGRETTED
NOT TAKING YOU.

577
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,665
>> WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOU SAYING THAT.

578
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,333
>> BUT I WANTED
TO SHOW YOU, TOO,

579
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,669
I TRUST YOU COMING BACK
TO CAMP WITH THE GUYS.

580
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,337
DID THEY TALK TO YOU AT ALL,

581
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,381
BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WERE GOING
TO TRY TO SWAY YOU.

582
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,508
>> YEAH, OF COURSE THEY KNOW

583
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,010
THAT I'M THE SWING VOTE.

584
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,679
>> I JUST KNOW YOU GAVE ME

585
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,138
YOUR WORD THAT YOU WERE WITH US.

586
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,682
>> I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

587
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,307
JUST MOVING FORWARD

588
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,642
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO STAY

589
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,977
AS STRONG AS WE CAN,

590
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,687
BECAUSE IF JANE MAKES IT
TO THE FINAL,

591
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,396
NO MATTER WHO SHE BRINGS,

592
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,647
SHE'S WINNING IT NO MATTER WHAT.

593
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,856
>> I KNOW THAT.

594
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,358
YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT.

595
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,360
BUT MY THING IS,

596
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,403
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TAKING YOU

597
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,404
TO THE FINAL THREE?

598
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,531
>> YEAH, WHAT I'M SAYING,

599
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,368
WILL YOU SWEAR ON YOUR MOTHER

600
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,205
AND YOUR WONDERFUL FATHER,

601
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,332
I KNOW YOU WOULD NEVER...

602
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,876
WOULD YOU BE WILLING

603
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,087
TO NOT VOTE ME OUT

604
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,881
AND THAT WHETHER
IT'S THE FINAL THREE

605
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,716
OR THE FINAL TWO

606
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,426
THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ME
NO MATTER WHAT?

607
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,510
>> YES.

608
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,889
>> I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

609
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,558
>> WE ALL TALKED ABOUT IT

610
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,393
AND WE WERE NERVOUS SENDING YOU

611
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,603
BACK WITH THE GUYS.

612
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,730
>> I WAS LIKE,

613
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,273
PLEASE DON'T LET THEM TALK HIM

614
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,899
INTO SWITCHING TEAMS.

615
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,735
>> OF COURSE THEY WANT ME

616
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,402
TO JUMP ON BOARD WITH THEM.

617
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,780
>> BENRY TOLD ME HE WANTS

618
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,573
TO KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME
WITH ME

619
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,950
AND THAT HE WANTS FABIO
OUT NEXT.

620
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,410
>> NO, THAT'S NOT...

621
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,703
THAT'S A STRAIGHT-UP LIE.

622
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,705
>> I THINK BENRY SHOULD GO NEXT

623
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,584
BECAUSE HE'S THE MOST
TO WIN IMMUNITY.

624
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,627
YOU SAID EARLIER
YOU DON'T THINK SO, FABIO.

625
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,087
>> WELL, EITHER OR.

626
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,298
IT IS GOING TO DEPEND
ON THE CHALLENGE.

627
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,674
WHAT IF HE WINS
THE CHALLENGE TOMORROW?

628
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,553
>> SASH IS BACK THERE TALKING

629
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,555
TO CHASE AND HOLLY TOGETHER.

630
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,433
>> DANGEROUS?

631
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,602
>> YEP.

632
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,898
BUT OUR PLAN IS DOOMED.

633
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,900
>> YOU KNOW,

634
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,651
IT WAS ORIGINALLY ME, DAN,

635
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,111
FABIO AND SASH

636
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,780
THAT WERE GOING TO GO IN

637
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,114
AND PICK THESE GUYS
OFF ONE BY ONE,

638
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,324
HOLLY, JANE AND CHASE,

639
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,076
BUT YOU CAN'T TRUST SASH.

640
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,285
I DON'T TRUST SASH.

641
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,453
BUT I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP

642
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,662
WITH MAMA HOLLY,

643
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,623
AND CHASE IS MY BOY
SINCE DAY ONE.

644
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,125
YOU KNOW,

645
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:57,626
SO WE'LL SEE IF I CAN END UP

646
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,668
CONFIDING IN THEM

647
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,504
AND CREATE MYSELF
A NEW ALLIANCE.

648
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,464
SO I DEFINITELY, YOU KNOW,

649
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,716
I FOUND A WAY TO SAVE MY ASS.

650
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,760
>> OH, YEAH.

651
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,429
>> COME ON DOWN.

652
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,597
>> WE'RE TALKING FABIO.

653
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,350
>> LET'S GET ON THE SAME PAGE.

654
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,477
>> WELL, WE'RE THINKING

655
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,814
YOU TALKED TO HIM EARLIER.

656
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,856
DID YOU TELL HIM?

657
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,150
I THINK FABIO
SHOULD BE THE NEXT.

658
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,111
>> I'M FINE DOING THAT,

659
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:24,736
AS LONG AS I STAY, DUDE.

660
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,656
JUST KEEP ME IN THE LOOP.

661
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,990
I WANT TO MAKE IT

662
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,325
ONE MORE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

663
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,035
>> AND JUST LIKE I TOLD
YOU GUYS,

664
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,661
I'M NOT SURE...

665
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,871
>> WOULD YOU VOTE HIM OUT?

666
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,665
>> WELL, HE HAS TO GO EVENTUALLY

667
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,667
IF I WANT TO MAKE IT TO THE END,

668
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,336
SO HOPEFULLY FABIO

669
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,838
DOESN'T WIN INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

670
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,714
THAT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

671
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,008
FOR ME IF HE DOES, OBVIOUSLY.

672
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,885
>> WHY?

673
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,970
>> WELL, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

674
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,722
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO JANE ARE,

675
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,683
BUT I DON'T THINK
ANY OF YOU WANT TO END UP

676
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,809
IN THE TOP THREE WITH JANE.

677
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,185
>> RIGHT.

678
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,771
>> SO EITHER JANE OR FABIO NEXT?

679
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,691
>> I CAME OVER

680
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,359
AND I TALKED TO CHASE AND HOLLY

681
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,694
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

682
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,320
AND, YOU KNOW,

683
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:07,821
THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM

684
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,906
VOTING OUT FABIO.

685
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,867
I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE BEATING
AROUND THE BUSH,

686
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,743
IF THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT ME WHEN I WAS WALKING UP.

687
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,661
SASH WAS IN ON THE CONVERSATION,
AS WELL,

688
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:18,248
AND I LET HIM KNOW THAT

689
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,708
AS LONG AS I'M NOT GOING HOME,

690
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,209
YOU KNOW,
I REALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

691
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,253
VOTING FABIO OUT.

692
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,671
I KNOW IT WOULD BE BREAKING UP
MY ALLIANCE A LITTLE BIT,

693
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,507
BUT IT'S AMAZING.

694
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,759
IT'S CRAZY WHAT A COUPLE HOURS

695
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,803
CAN DO AROUND CAMP.

696
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,978
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

697
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,736
YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

698
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,279
>> ABSOLUTELY.

699
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,822
>> Jeff: JANE,
FIRST THINGS FIRST,

700
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,865
I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

701
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,450
THANK YOU.

702
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,953
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY

703
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:57,787
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

704
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,040
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

705
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,250
YOU WILL BE ATTACHED
TO A HITCHING RAIL.

706
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,293
ON MY GO,

707
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,795
YOU'LL MANEUVER OVER
AND UNDER THE HITCHING RAIL,

708
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,589
RELEASING ROPE AS YOU GO.

709
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,382
WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE
ENOUGH ROPE,

710
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,093
YOU'LL ATTEMPT TO GRAB
A BAG OF GOLD COINS.

711
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,596
THE FIRST THREE TO GET THEIR BAG

712
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,264
OF COINS MOVE ON
TO THE FINAL ROUND.

713
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,098
FOR THE FINAL ROUND,

714
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,725
YOU MUST SOLVE
A GOLD COIN PUZZLE.

715
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,770
THE FIRST PERSON TO GET IT RIGHT

716
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,438
WINS IMMUNITY,

717
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,940

SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT.

00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,405
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

723
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,365
>> ABSOLUTELY.

724
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,616
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,

725
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,660

BENRY AND FABIO

THROWING THEMSELVES

734
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,639
OVER THESE HITCHING RAILS.

735
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,809
SASH RIGHT IN THERE.

736
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,895
WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE
ENOUGH ROPE

737
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,313
TO REACH THE GOLD BAG,

738
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,314
GIVE IT A SHOT.

739
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,357
IF YOU'RE WRONG,

740
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,067
YOU GOT TO GO BACK
AND GET MORE ROPE.

00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,658
HERE GOES FABIO.

745
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,660
DOES HE HAVE ENOUGH ROPE

746
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,077
TO GET THERE?

747
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,829
PLENTY TO SPARE.

748
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,706
FABIO MOVING ON
TO THE FINAL ROUND.

749
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,707
SASH NOW GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.

750
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,501
BENRY NOW GIVING IT A GO.

751
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,421
SASH IS SHORT.

752
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,505
BENRY'S SHORT.

753
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,673
YOU NEED TO PICK IT UP NOW.

754
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,175
THIS IS GOING
TO BE OVER QUICKLY.

755
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,511
JANE NOW HEADING OUT.

756
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,137
DOES SHE HAVE ENOUGH ROPE?

757
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,347
JANE'S GOING TO BE SHORT.

758
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,391
JANE, BENRY AND SASH FIGHTING

759
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,893
FOR THAT SECOND AND THIRD SPOT.

760
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,021
BENRY GIVING IT A GO.

761
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:46,813
SASH RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

762
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,858
BENRY MOVING ON.

763
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,903
SASH MOVING ON.

764
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,033
ALL RIGHT.

765
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,326
IN THE FINAL ROUND,

766
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,369
BENRY, FABIO, SASH.

767
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,038
SURVIVORS READY?

768
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,414
GO.

769
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,708
WE HAVE GIVEN YOU THREE STACKS

770
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,752
OF GOLD COINS TO BEGIN WITH.

771
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,379
YOU HAVE TEN OTHER SACKS
OF GOLD COINS

772
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,756
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY GO.

773
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,090
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,

774
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:14,883
YOU WILL HAVE
A RECTANGULAR SHAPE

775
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,344
OF GOLD COINS.

776
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,511
>> COME ON, GUYS.

777
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,220
Y'ALL CAN DO IT.

778
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,556
>> Jeff: BEEN OUT HERE 32 DAYS.

779
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:25,018
HOW SHARP IS WHATEVER
IS LEFT OF YOUR MIND?

780
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:25,935
SOME PEOPLE REALLY EXCEL

781
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,271
AT PUZZLES LIKE THIS.

782
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,940
OTHERS, LIKE ME, DO NOT.

783
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,734
BENRY ALL OVER THE PLACE.

784
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,777
>> COME ON, BENRY.

785
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,779
YOU CAN DO IT.

786
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:36,738
>> Jeff: FABIO MAKING
VERY LITTLE PROGRESS.

787
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,032
>> COME ON, FABIO.

788
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,575
>> Jeff: SASH MAKING PROGRESS
ON HIS PUZZLE.

789
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,035
>> COME ON, SASH.

790
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,580
>> SHUT UP.

791
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,082
>> WERE YOU A CHEERLEADER
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

792
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,291
>> YES.

793
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,293
>> Jeff: THE PUZZLE
IS ALREADY DIFFICULT.

794
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:50,960
THIS COULD CONCEIVABLY BE

795
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,713
A MILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE

796
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,048
FOR ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU.

797
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,300
>> MAN, I HAVE NO FREAKING CLUE.

798
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,177
>> Jeff: BENRY ABOUT READY
TO GIVE UP.

799
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,930
FABIO NOW STUDYING SASH'S PUZZLE

800
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,266
LOOKING FOR SOME HELP.

801
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,935
IF SASH IS RIGHT,

802
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,436
HE'S MAKING SOME PROGRESS.

803
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,772
FABIO NOW STARTING

804
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,817
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

805
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,778
FABIO AND SASH

806
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,781
NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW.

807
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,241
FABIO GETTING CLOSER.

808
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,410
SASH IS VERY CLOSE.

809
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,161
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.

810
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,038
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

811
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:31,501
GOT TO CLOSE THE BOX TO FINISH.

812
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,295
SASH WINS IMMUNITY.

813
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,297
>> WOW.

814
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,301
>> Jeff: SASH, COME ON OVER.

815
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,223
CONGRATULATIONS.

816
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,975
>> WAY TO GO, SASH.

817
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,309
>> Jeff: SASH GUARANTEED

818
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,478
A ONE IN SIX SHOT
AT WINNING THE MONEY.

819
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,020
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

820
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,189
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU,

821
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,941
AFTER 32 VERY TOUGH DAYS,

822
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,485
ONE OF YOU GOING HOME TONIGHT.

823
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,570
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

824
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,529
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

825
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,530
CONGRATULATIONS.

826
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,657
>> THANKS, JEFF.

827
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,011
>> I PULLED OUT THE WIN TODAY.

828
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,221
IT FEELS GREAT.

829
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,681
RIGHT NOW I'M A TRIPLE THREAT,

830
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,683
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,

831
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:29,976
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,

832
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,145
AND I'M
IN THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE.

833
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,688
SO AT THIS POINT,

834
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,565
I'M IN COMPLETE CONTROL.

835
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,025
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL

836
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,068
TO WIN MY MILLION.

837
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,029
>> ALL THAT BRAIN WORK.

838
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,198
>> MY HEAD WAS HURTING
JUST WATCHING YOU GUYS.

839
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,826
>> MOST OF THE CHALLENGES
I'VE BEEN SAND BAGGING,

840
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,662
GOING MAYBE 70%, 80%,

841
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,040
AND NOW I LOOK AT PEOPLE
LIKE BENRY AND FABIO,

842
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,001
WHO HAVE BEEN GOING 110%
EVERY CHALLENGE,

843
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,045
AND THE REASON WHY
THEY PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT

844
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,048
TO THE FINAL IS BECAUSE THEY ARE

845
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,675
A PHYSICAL THREAT TO WIN
THE FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

846
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,053
>> WILL YOU LET THEM...

847
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,223
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW
IF MY NAME COMES UP?

848
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,724
>> YEAH.

849
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:10,934
YES.

850
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:15,313
>> I JUST GOT
AN UNEASY FEELING THIS MORNING

851
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,107
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

852
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,984
I JUST THINK THAT CHASE FEELS

853
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,278
THAT HE'S REALLY CLOSE TO BENRY,

854
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,322
SO IF THEY WANTED
TO PULL SOMETHING,

855
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,115
I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE ON ME.

856
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,408
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

857
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,910
>> YEAH.

858
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,036
>> BECAUSE IF THEY'RE GOING
TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING,

859
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,413
THEY HAVE TO HAVE YOU.

860
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,415
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO HEAR IT EITHER WAY.

861
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,793
YOU CAN LET THEM THINK

862
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,420
YOU'LL GO ALONG
WITH WHAT THEY SAY OR WHATEVER,

863
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,089
BUT PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

864
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,007
>> I'LL GIVE YOU GUYS
THE INSIDE SCOOP.

865
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,093
>> MY INSTINCTS TELL ME

866
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,763
THAT SASH IS STILL A BIT
OF A SWING VOTE,

867
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,974
YOU KNOW, BUT HE'S CLOSER TO ME

868
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,226
THAN ANYBODY ON THE TRIBE,

869
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,895
SO IF HE'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF A SWING VOTE,

870
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,647
AND IT'S MY NAME
ON THE OTHER SIDE,

871
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,440
HE'S GOING TO TELL ME,
I FEEL LIKE.

872
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,234
>> LET'S JUST ASK DAN
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.

873
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,611
>> I FEEL LIKE SITTING BACK
RIGHT NOW

874
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,655
AND BEING COOL IS PART OF IT,
YOU KNOW?

875
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,782
WE'LL SEE, THOUGH.

876
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,617
YOU KNOW,
IT'S HARD TO TELL AND...

877
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,120
WE'LL SEE, MAN.

878
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,955
>> HEY, MAN.

879
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,457
>> WHAT'S UP?

880
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,625
>> WHO ARE YOU THINKING?

881
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,793
>> I DON'T KNOW.

882
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,294
WHO ARE YOU THINKING?

883
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,589
>> AS FAR AS I KNOW,

884
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,298
EVERYONE...

885
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,508
EVERYONE HAS BEEN SAYING FABIO.

886
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,177
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

887
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,141
>> IT'S EASY THEN.

888
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,642
>> OKAY. YOU GOT IT?

889
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,102
>> I GUESS SO.

890
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,104
RIGHT NOW CHASE AND I ARE
STRINGING ALONG FABIO,

891
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,648
BENRY AND DAN

892
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,650
INTO THINKING DIFFERENT THINGS

893
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,110
OF WHO IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.

894
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,153
RIGHT NOW THE TWO NAMES
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK

895
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,740
ARE FABIO AND BENRY.

896
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,241
MY STOMACH IS MESSED UP.

897
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,493
SO THEY REALLY HAVE NO IDEA

898
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,661
WHAT'S GOING ON.

899
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,871
I'M GOING TO KEEP THEM GUESSING

900
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,164
UNTIL I FEEL LIKE TELLING THEM,

901
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,207
OR NOT TELLING THEM.

902
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,299
>> JANE. JANE.

903
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,301
>> WHAT UP?

904
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,679
>> DO YOU THINK HE'LL BUY THAT?

905
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,805
>> YEAH.

906
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,848
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

907
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,682
>> WHY?

908
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,060
>> I THINK IT'S BETTER
TO TELL HIM

909
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,686
THAT WE'RE GOING
TO VOTE OFF HOLLY.

910
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,230
>> I'LL DO WHATEVER.

911
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,358
>> SASH, ARE YOU WILLING
TO DO THAT?

912
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,359
>> HUH?

913
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,360
>> CAN YOU DO THAT?

914
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,819
>> WHAT?

915
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,362
>> JUST CONVINCE FABIO

916
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,989
THAT ME, YOU AND DAN

917
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:30,990
ARE GOING TO VOTE HOLLY?

918
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,076
>> I FEEL GUILTY FOR LYING,

919
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,787
BUT AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME GOING
HOME NEXT

920
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,371
AND EVERYBODY AGREES THAT,
YOU KNOW,

921
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,498
THEY'LL VOTE OFF FABIO,

922
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,583
I THINK IT WILL BE PRETTY SIMPLE
TO PITCH TO FABIO

923
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,086
THAT WE WANT TO GET HOLLY
OUT OF HERE,

924
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,339
AND I DON'T THINK HE'LL BUY
THE WHOLE JANE THING

925
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,926
JUST IN TERMS OF CHASE
AND JANE BEING SO CLOSE,

926
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,928
SO AS LONG AS I'M NOT GOING HOME
TONIGHT,

927
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,388
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

928
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,932
TO STAY HERE FOR ONE MORE NIGHT.

929
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,394
>> SASH SAID
HE WOULD VOTE HOLLY.

930
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,271
DUDE, HE REALIZES
WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM

931
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,565
IN TERMS OF ALLIANCE-WISE.

932
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,526
>> HOLLY OR JANE?

933
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,193
>> HOLLY.

934
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,236
>> HOLLY?

935
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,196
I'LL VOTE HOLLY.

936
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,572
>> ME, YOU, DAN AND SASH

937
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,865
ARE GOING TO VOTE HOLLY.

938
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,075
>> AND THEN CHASE?

939
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,410
>> I HAVEN'T TALKED TO CHASE.

940
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,495
AS LONG AS US FOUR VOTE HOLLY,

941
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,871
WE'RE GOOD.

942
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:19,789
>> STICK TO THAT

943
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,249
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
MUCH POLITICKING.

944
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,126
>> THEN THE DAY IS MELLOW.

945
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,627
WE LAY LOW.

946
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,713
>> YEAH, I WAS FEELING
A LITTLE WORRIED EARLIER.

947
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,923
I WASN'T SURE IF MY NAME

948
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,925
WAS BEING THROWN AROUND
OR THIS AND THAT.

949
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:33,761
IT MADE SENSE FOR THEM TO WANT
TO GET ME OUT, I THOUGHT,

950
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,889
SO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT GETTING
HOLLY OUT, YOU KNOW.

951
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,434
I THINK SHE'S OVERSTAYED
HER WELCOME ALMOST.

952
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,102
SHE'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT...

953
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,480
I'M JUST I'M READY
FOR HER TO GO.

954
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,942
>> READY TO GO
ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS OUT HERE?

955
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:48,317
>> YEAH.

956
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,111
>> ME TOO.

957
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,112
>> I MEAN...

958
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,238
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO

959
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,781
IF YOU WEREN'T OUT HERE.

960
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,116
YOU REALLY ARE
LIKE A SECOND MOM TO ME.

961
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,451
>> WELL, I'M GOING
TO TELL YOU WHAT,

962
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,744
BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED

963
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,369
WAS I GOT PICKED BEFORE.

964
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,371
REALLY.

965
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,290
>> WELL, IT REALLY MEANS
A LOT TO ME

966
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,625
THAT YOU'RE OUT HERE

967
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,461
AND THAT YOU TRUST ME ENOUGH

968
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,795
THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.

969
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,631
SO JUST KNOW
THAT I HAVE YOUR BACK, OKAY?

970
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,758
>> I GOT YOURS.

971
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,633
>> THANK YOU.

972
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,509
>> I FEEL REAL GOOD

973
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,970
BECAUSE I THINK
OUR FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE

974
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:17,138
IS GOING TO STAY STRONG

975
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,973
AND HOPEFULLY OUR FOUR,

976
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:23,811
WHICH IS CHASE, HOLLY,
SASH AND ME

977
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,855
WILL BE IN THE FINAL FOUR.

978
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,983
>> NOW THAT I KNOW I HAVE CHASE,
YOU AND HOLLY...

979
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,526
>> WE GOT FOUR GOOD PEOPLE.

980
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,528
>> I THINK WE ALL FELL IN PLACE

981
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,280
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW
THAT WE'RE LOYAL,

982
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,366
SINCERE AND THAT
WE'RE JUST GOOD PEOPLE.

983
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,368
>> YES, YES.

984
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,370
>> YOU CAN'T BACKSTAB SOMEONE
WHO YOU HAVE LOTS OF LOVE FOR.

985
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,331
>> NO.

986
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,832
>> YOU CAN'T BACKSTAB MY MOM,

987
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,167
CAN'T BACKSTAB MY SECOND MOM.

988
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,502
>> OKAY.

989
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,836
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

990
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,837
LET'S GO.

991
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,172
I REALLY AND TRULY THINK

992
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,215
SASH HAS A GREAT HEART

993
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,509
AND SASH IS NOT GOING TO GO
WITH THEM.

994
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,804
SASH IS GUARANTEED FINAL FOUR
WITH US.

995
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,680
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO VOTE HIM OUT.

996
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,058
FABIO AND BENRY HAVE BEEN

997
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,143
A PHYSICAL THREAT SINCE DAY ONE.

998
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,728
ALWAYS HAVE, ALWAYS WILL.

999
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,688
SO EITHER BENRY OR FABIO

1000
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,231
IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1001
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,691
HOLLY, CHASE AND I,

1002
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,193
WE NEVER PLANNED THIS
IN THE BEGINNING.

1003
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,278
WE JUST CAME TOGETHER

1004
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,239
AND ENDED UP MESHING.

1005
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,407
AND IT'S LIKE SPOKES ON A WHEEL.

1006
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,660
WE'RE JUST TURNING
THE CLOCK RIGHT NOW.

1007
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,328
TURNING THE CLOCK.

1008
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,705
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET

1009
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,706
TO PICK THEM OFF ONE BY ONE

1010
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,292
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY PLANNED
TO DO TO US.

1011
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,058
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING
IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1012
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,565
ALINA, MARTY, BRENDA,

1013
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,357
AND OUR TWO QUITTERS,

1014
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,110
NAONKA AND PURPLE KELLY,

1015
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,237
WHO QUIT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1016
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,286
LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE REWARD, CHASE.

1017
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,079
PART OF THE REWARD CHALLENGE

1018
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,415
WAS CHOOSING TWO PEOPLE
TO GO WITH YOU.

1019
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,583
>> RIGHT.

1020
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,584
>> Jeff: ON ONE HAND,

1021
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,252
GREAT STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY

1022
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,920
TO MAKE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE
VERY HAPPY.

1023
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,963
ON THE OTHER HAND,

1024
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,257
YOU LEAVE FOUR
OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND.

1025
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,717
HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU THAT

1026
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,427
THAT CAN WORK AGAINST YOU?

1027
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,596
>> I WAS PRETTY CONCERNED
IT WOULD WORK AGAINST ME.

1028
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,139
I MEAN, YOU GOT TWO PEOPLE

1029
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,599
YOU'RE MAKING HAPPY,
FOUR PEOPLE YOU'RE MAKING MAD.

1030
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,766
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

1031
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,560
BUT I HAD TO CHOOSE TWO PEOPLE.

1032
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,395
>> Jeff: CHASE, CONCERNED AT ALL

1033
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,814
THAT JUST DUE TO BEING
YOUNG AND FIT

1034
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,441
THAT YOU'RE A THREAT RIGHT NOW

1035
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,610
BECAUSE YOU COULD
CONCEIVABLY WIN YOUR WAY

1036
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,444
TO A SPOT AT THE FINAL?

1037
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,613
>> YEAH, I'M A PHYSICAL THREAT,

1038
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,947
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

1039
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,449
I HAVEN'T WON
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY YET.

1040
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,743
I THINK IT'S CLEAR FABIO,
BENRY AND I

1041
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,078
ARE THE THREE BIGGEST
PHYSICAL THREATS HERE.

1042
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,997
SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
THAT WEIGHS ON YOUR MIND.

1043
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,206
GETS YOU A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

1044
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,750
>> Jeff: BENRY, WHERE ARE YOU AT

1045
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,126
IN TERMS OF BEING CONCERNED

1046
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,961
YOU'RE TOO MUCH
OF A PHYSICAL THREAT?

1047
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,504
>> I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED.

1048
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,632
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

1049
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,216
THAT THESE GUYS THINK
I'M A THREAT,

1050
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,302
AND IT CONCERNS ME
A LITTLE BIT FOR SURE.

1051
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,096
>> Jeff: JANE, WHEN YOU LOOK
AT SOMEBODY LIKE FABIO

1052
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,848
AND YOU COMPARE HIM TO YOU

1053
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,475
WITH THESE CHALLENGES COMING UP,

1054
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,226
HOW BIG OF A TARGET

1055
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,645
DO YOU PUT ON HIS BACK?

1056
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,480
>> WELL, HE'S DEFINITELY
A LOT STRONGER,

1057
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,981
A LOT MORE BUILT,

1058
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,358
FASTER,

1059
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,485
MAYBE NOT THE SMARTEST ON THE
PUZZLES,

1060
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,154
BUT AS FAR AS BEING
A PHYSICAL THREAT,

1061
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,698
OH, YEAH,
HE'S A BIG PHYSICAL THREAT.

1062
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,491
>> Jeff: FABIO, WHAT DO YOU DO

1063
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,035
TO KEEP THE TARGET
OFF YOUR BACK?

1064
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,453
YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR AGE
OR YOUR PHYSICAL ABILITY.

1065
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,331
>> I STAY FRIENDLY
WITH PEOPLE AROUND CAMP.

1066
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,083
I TALK TO EVERYBODY.

1067
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:32,792
I MAKE SURE THEY KNOW

1068
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,795
THAT I'M PRETTY HONEST AND OPEN.

1069
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,422
I HAVE TO TRUST MY ALLIANCE TO,
YOU KNOW,

1070
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,507
GET ME FURTHER IN THE GAME

1071
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,801
AND THOSE PEOPLE
THAT I HAVE TOLD

1072
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,511
THE WHOLE GAME I'VE TRUSTED,

1073
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,180
YOU KNOW, WE'LL GO FURTHER
IN THE GAME TOGETHER.

1074
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,349
>> Jeff: BENRY, WE'RE GETTING
DOWN TO IT NOW, RIGHT?

1075
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,643
THIS IS WHERE THE BIG MOVES

1076
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,144
ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.

1077
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:52,812
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU

1078
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,814
THAT IT WILL SWING YOUR WAY?

1079
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,525
>> I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT

1080
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,361
THAT IT WILL SWING
MY WAY TONIGHT.

1081
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,821
>> Jeff: SASH, GREAT NIGHT

1082
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,073
TO HAVE IMMUNITY
AROUND YOUR NECK.

1083
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,826
>> IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE COME
WITH IMMUNITY AROUND MY NECK.

1084
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:07,868
IT IS A GREAT FEELING.

1085
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,454
IT GIVES ME A CLEARER IDEA
COMING INTO TRIBAL.

1086
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,041
BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU HAVE
THIS AROUND YOUR NECK,

1087
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,711
IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU MORE.

1088
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,504
THE MORE PEOPLE TALK TO YOU
IN THIS GAME,

1089
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,090
THE BETTER YOU PROBABLY ARE.

1090
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,010
>> Jeff: FABIO, DID YOU SEE
PEOPLE APPROACHING SASH?

1091
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,095
>> YEAH, I DID, DEFINITELY.

1092
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,597
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HANG
AROUND CAMP

1093
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,433
AND WATCH WHO GOES OFF

1094
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,059
AND TALKS AND THIS AND THAT,

1095
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,353
BUT I WASN'T WORRIED.

1096
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,939
>> Jeff: HOLLY, DID YOU SEE
PEOPLE APPROACHING SASH TODAY?

1097
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:37,648
>> YES, I DID.

1098
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,567
>> Jeff: DOES THAT CONCERN YOU?

1099
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,527
>> WELL, I THINK IT
CONCERNS EVERYONE.

1100
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,863
>> Jeff: IT DOESN'T
CONCERN FABIO.

1101
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,072
HE JUST SAID.

1102
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,907
>> WELL, I FEEL SORRY
FOR HIM THEN.

1103
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,743
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO PEOPLE.

1104
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,453
YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1105
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,580
IF YOU JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH,

1106
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,957
YOU MIGHT NOT BE FURTHERING
YOURSELF IN THE GAME.

1107
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,085
SO COMMUNICATION IS HUGE.

1108
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,881
>> Jeff: WELL,
IT SOUNDS LIKE TONIGHT'S VOTE

1109
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,550
WILL DETERMINE WHICH ALLIANCE
HOLDS STRONG

1110
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,635
AND WHICH ALLIANCE FALLS APART.

1111
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,553
SASH, YOU HAVE THE NECKLACE.

1112
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,430
I ASSUME YOU'RE KEEPING IT?

1113
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,765
>> I'M GOING TO HOLD ON
TO IT TONIGHT.

1114
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,891
>> Jeff: CANNOT VOTE FOR SASH.

1115
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,434
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1116
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:13,851
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1117
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,686
DAN, YOU'RE UP.

1118
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,733
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1119
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,662
IF ANYBODY HAS
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

1120
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,371
AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1121
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,499
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1122
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,171
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1123
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,172
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1124
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,173
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1125
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,217
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

1126
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,261
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1127
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,266
FIRST VOTE HOLLY.

1128
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:38,727
FABIO.

1129
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,688
ONE VOTE FABIO.

1130
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,650
FABIO.

1131
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,860
TWO VOTES FABIO.

1132
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,903
ONE VOTE HOLLY.

1133
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,866
BENRY.

1134
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,868
ONE VOTE BENRY.

1135
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,705
BENRY.

1136
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,706
WE'RE TIED.

1137
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,124
TWO VOTES BENRY,

1138
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,375
TWO VOTES FABIO,

1139
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:04,712
ONE VOTE HOLLY.

1140
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,213
BENRY.

1141
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:06,672
THAT'S THREE VOTES BENRY,

1142
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,674
TWO VOTES FABIO,

1143
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,717
ONE VOTE HOLLY,

1144
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,760
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1145
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,057
12th PERSON VOTED OUT

1146
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,601
AND THE SIXTH MEMBER
OF OUR JURY:

1147
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,727
BENRY.

1148
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,729
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1149
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,864
BENRY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1150
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,866
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

1151
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,504
>> Jeff:
COMING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

1152
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,548
EVERYBODY TRUSTED
THEIR ALLIANCE.

1153
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,883
LEAVING TRIBAL COUNCIL,

1154
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,218
NOT SO MUCH.

1155
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,802
AND THEREIN LIES THE TRICKY PART
OF ALLIANCES,

1156
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,765
REALIZING WHEN YOU CAN
NO LONGER TRUST THEM.

1157
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,933
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1158
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,934
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1159
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,936
GOOD NIGHT.

1160
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,780
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1161
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:17,952
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON:<i> SURVIVOR.</i>

1162
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,495
COME ON IN GUYS!

1163
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,204
WITH ONLY TWO EPISODES LEFT,

1164
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,872
THE STAKES ARE HIGHER THAN EVER.

1165
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,748
SASH, I'LL TAKE BACK
THE NECKLACE.

1166
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,751
AND AT THE CHALLENGE THE WINNERS

1167
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,504
GET ENOUGH LUXURY TO KEEP THEM
STRONG UNTIL THE END.

1168
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,964
>> OH, MAN.

1169
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,298
AND AS FOR THE LOSERS...

1170
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,593
THEY WILL BE TAKEN AND EXECUTED.

1171
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,434
>> I'M EXTREMELY SURPRISED.

1172
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,520
I JUST GOT STRAIGHT BLINDSIDED.

1173
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,815
NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING COMING
INTO THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1174
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,317
I'M DEFINITELY GOING
TO HAVE TO ASSESS

1175
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,152
WHO MASTERMINDED THIS IDEA
OF SENDING BENRY HOME.

1176
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,030
I GUESS THE OTHER SIX
REMAINING MEMBERS

1177
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,365
SEE ME AS A THREAT.

1178
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,408
I GUESS I HAVE TO TAKE THAT
SOME WHAT AS A COMPLIMENT.
