00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:07,757
>> JEFF: We're onboard a 38-

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:12,554
squadron Caribou DHC-4 military
aircraft on loan from the Royal

3
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:16,099
Australian Air Force.
Normally, these planes are used

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,102
to rescue people in dangerous,
life threatening situations.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,647
Today, however, we have a
different mission.

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,233
These 16 Americans are about to
be abandoned.

7
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,611
This plane will land in the
heart of one of the most

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,782
unforgiving places anywhere on
earth: the Australian outback.

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,285
For the next 42 days, they'll be
left to fend for themselves,

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,955
forced to work together to
create a new society while

11
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,750
battling the elements and each
other.

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,628
They must learn to adapt, or
they'll be voted from the tribe.

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,797
In the end, one will remain and
will claim the million-dollar

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:56,973
prize.
42 days, 16 people, one

00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:06,107
survivor.

16
00:01:06,191 --> 00:02:16,553
survivor.
(<i> retching</i> )

17
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,076
As this plane touches down on a
remote strip of land in the

18
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,371
Australian outback, these 16
strangers begin the adventure of

19
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,291
a lifetime.
They have never spoken to each

20
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,753
other, and the rules state they
must remain quiet until after

21
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:56,259
the plane has landed, dropped
them off, and abandoned them.

22
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,053
They have been separated into
two competing tribes: Kucha and

23
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,098
Ogakor.
One crate of supplies awaits

24
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,643
each tribe, and once the plane
has taken off, they will have

25
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,438
only five minutes to salvage
whatever they can carry.

26
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,734
They then face a grueling 5-mile
hike that will take them deep

27
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:18,323
into the outback and their new
homes for the next 42 days.

28
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,950
The Kucha tribe, which will
always wear blue, consists of

29
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,622
Kimmi Kappenberg, a bartender
from Long Island; Michael

Carolina.

>> JEFF: Ogakor tribe, which
will always wear green, consists

40
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,330

"Unfortunately, all of the water
you will need for the next few

57
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:23,489

>> NICK: Okay, that's north.

64

>> How much do you need?
>> DEBB: I don't know the names

65
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,630
yet.
In the green hat right here.

66
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,592
Can you help her get one side of
this undone?

00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:47,263

need to go now.

69
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,266
>> Grab something, all right?
>> All right, we'll get it,

70
00:05:50,349 --> 00:06:00,359
we'll get it.
>> JEFF: The tribes will split

71
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:08,451
we'll get it.

00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,912
up and head in opposite
directions.

73
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,580
Their camps are situated four
miles apart, along the shore of

74
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,625
the Herbert River.
Each beach has a flag and a

75
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,295
canoe.
Finding these sites will be the

76
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,631
first unofficial challenge for
the new survivors.

compass...

78
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,010
Okay, northeast we have to go?

79
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,470
but, okay...
>> KIMMI: That's north.

80
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,764
>> NICK: That's north right now,
so northeast is, like, across

81
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,807
back that way.
>> KIMMI: That way.

82
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,812
We're going the wrong way.
We're going the wrong way.

83
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,064
>> ALICIA: When they dropped us
off, you know, everybody was

84
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,317
designated a certain thing to
do, and, uh, they gave Nick the

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,322
compass.
For some reason, although the

86
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:50,326
compass said one way... we kept
going the wrong way.

87
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,869
>> DEBB: Tell me something.
He's telling me we're moving

88
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,995
this way.
>> ALICIA: I know we are.

89
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,330
Yankees?
>> DEBB: Are we moving in the

90
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,248
right direction?
>> ALICIA: Absolutely, all the

91
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,666
way, baby.
>> I think we should check, like

92
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,834
every...
>> DEBB: All right, then that's

93
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,671
where we're going. Nick? Nick?
Stay in the front, Nick, and

94
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,132
keep us going north to
northeast, okay, but keep us

95
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,842
going north...
>> MICHAEL: There's a... there's

96
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,718
a beaten path.
>> KIMMI: What's your name

97
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,803
again?
>> MICHAEL: Mike.

98
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,846
>> ALICIA: Mike.
>> DEBB: Let's just stop for one

99
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,806
second and look at the map.
>> MICHAEL: All right.

100
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,849
>> DEBB: And look at the
compass.

101
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,517
>> MICHAEL: All right.
>> DEBB: Just to make sure,

102
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,643
'cause it's a long ways to where
we're going.

103
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,395
>> NICK: Even from the
beginning, I was finding, like,

104
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,896
people were automatically
getting on people's nerves.

105
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,690
Um, yeah, we were walking
through the grass, and Kimmi was

106
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,985
like, "I can't stand, uh, Debb."
>> DEBB: See, if we're going

107
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,362
southwest, how are we going to
hit the dry creek bed?

108
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,157
>> KIMMI: Because that's north!
>> DEBB: That's right, so we're

109
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,534
not going to hit it unless we go
that way.

110
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,451
>> KIMMI: Debb's not even a bad
person.

111
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,371
She means well.
It's just she's not somebody

112
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,706
that in the outside world that I
would talk to, because... she'd

113
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:51,137
make me crazy.
>> MARALYN: When you traverse

114
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,639
something that I could bust my
butt on, let me know.

115
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,226
The hike, uh... it was a little
intimidating.

116
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,771
Um, I was afraid.
"Good grief, what if I get so

117
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:05,026
winded that I can't keep up?"
Do you see the flag?

118
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:10,907
Wait a minute, hang on.
>> COLBY: You all right,

119
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,243
Maralyn?
That trek let me know that this

120
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,246
was for real.
That was a long trek we had

121
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,624
through deep sand with a lot of
heavy equipment, and I was

122
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,377
packing more weight than anyone
else, so I was really

123
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,422
struggling.
It was a long trip, and that

124
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:30,009
was... that fired me up, because
that is the quickest way to find

125
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:35,765
out what people are made of.
>> AMBER: (<i> groans</i> )

126
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,726
I'm a little tired.
This rice is very heavy.

127
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:45,942
I really want to get there soon.
>> COLBY: We don't know how far

128
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,486
away we are, so I'm going to run
up this and do a little

129
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,238
reconnaissance, see if we can't
find out where we're at.

130
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,240
I figure if it's really far,
we'll drape some of our stuff

131
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,617
here, and we won't take it.
If we're not far, then we'll

132
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,286
buck up and get it there.
Yeah, I'm going to keep going.

133
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,913
We're just going to follow the
creek bed here, and, uh, make

134
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,124
sure if it looks like it's
getting too dark, you turn back

135
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,752
and come get us.
>> JERRI: Keith actually ran

136
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,130
ahead to go scout out where the
camp was, 'cause we were all

137
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,468
getting pretty tired, and the
last leg of that walk was really

138
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:22,520
difficult.
>> COLBY: I wish the snakes

139
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:32,530
difficult.
>> COLBY: I wish the snakes

140
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,448
would...
>> MARALYN: Never let 'em see

141
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:41,497
you sweat.
>> KEL: Keith?

142
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,708
>> KEITH: Here I come.
>> KEL: Okay, what do you see?

143
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,126
>> KEITH: I found it.
>> Oh, my God!

144
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,169
>> Yay!
>> Let's go!

145
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,007
>> JERRI: Whoo!
(<i> laughing</i> )

146
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,344
>> Whoo!
>> JERRI: Whoo!

147
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,473
>> Yeah!
(<i> cheering</i> )

148
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,693
(<i> grunts</i> )
>> JEFF V.: I'm feeling really

149
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,487
weak, and, um, on the verge of
throwing up just ever since I

150
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,531
got here.
I mean, it started with the

151
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,700
plane flight.
In the beginning, it was really

152
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,995
fun, and it was kind of cool and
groovy, and I was enjoying the

153
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,705
ride, and then all of a sudden,
I just got sort of nauseous, and

154
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,709
I kept thinking to myself, 'I'm
not going to get sick.

155
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,919
'I'm not going to get sick.
I will not throw up.'

156
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,298
So I sort of went into this
little zone and breathed, and I

157
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:37,845
don't remember any of it.
>> KIMMI: Rodger carried one of

158
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,723
the big water jugs.
Mike had a big water jug.

159
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,893
Poor Elisabeth had the board on
her head, and then I had the

160
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,271
eight bottled waters wrapped
around me, so the-the four of

161
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,732
us kind of got separated from
the other four when we were

162
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:55,071
walking to our campground.
>> ELISABETH: I mean, everything

163
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,781
was heavy to carry.
You can't discount any of our

164
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,075
equipment as easy to carry, but
some of it was just more

165
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,911
awkward.
And some of the crossings, we

166
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,538
had to go, you know, down a
sharp valley of rocks. and up

167
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,874
again, and kind of wind and
balance across a river.

168
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,753
And it was frustrating, too, but
with the water jugs and, you

169
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,589
know, the water canteens, and...
I mean, that stuff is just

170
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:23,682
awkward.
>> Oh, I see the flag.

171
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:30,815
awkward.
>> Oh, I see the flag.

172
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,568
Oh, my God!
Welcome to our home.

173
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,986
>> Right up there.
>> KIMMI: When we arrived, it

174
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,324
was just a moment of ecstasy,
'cause it's like, "Yes!

175
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,451
I've worked this far just to see
this silly thing."

176
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,036
I mean... And not just
physically from here, but just

177
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,332
mentally preparing yourself the
whole journey, like, all the

178
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,793
airplane flights from New York
to California to Australia, from

179
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,087
the other part of Australia to
here to there.

180
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,797
You know, there were just so
many things in sequence to get

181
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,966
you to that flag that just being
at that flag is just an

182
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:02,179
accomplishment.
(<i> yelling</i> )

183
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:12,273
(<i> cheering</i> )
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

184
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:25,703
(<i> cheering</i> )
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

185
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,670
>> DEBB: We should be up-up in
the trees to some degree.

186
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,005
There's no shelter here at all.
>> ELISABETH: As soon as we got

187
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,674
out of the river, I think we
just... this kind of

188
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,509
realization.
We got a little cold, and we

189
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,887
realized that we're going to...
we have to sleep somewhere, and

190
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,307
we just wanted to feel a little
safe and dry.

191
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,059
So we got to work as much as we
could on building the basis of a

192
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,354
home.
>> DEBB: We got enough rocks

193
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,690
here, too!
We could build a pretty decent

194
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,403
shelter just using rocks!
>> MICHAEL: (<i> groans</i> )

195
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,697
It's going to make is softer to
sleep on.

196
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,449
>> ALICIA: Want to see a what?
>> DEBB: That means there's

197
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,036
snakes in there.
>> MICHAEL: When we started

198
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,663
building the shelter, I thought
everybody started chipping in,

199
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,750
because there was the wood
gatherers, and there was the

200
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,754
people that were building, and,
uh, I had worked a lot of, uh,

201
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,215
you know, some construction in
my life, and I-I had a

202
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,510
reasonable sense of, uh, of-of
construction.

203
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,220
What we're going to have to do
is just cut little holes in

204
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,680
here, and then just tie it
around the top here about this

205
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,600
high, so that we can just make
it right here.

206
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,105
Um, we need one to go right
about halfway up along this

207
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,066
support right here.
>> DEBB: It seems like one

208
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,987
individual in the group is...
ordering everybody around, and

209
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,282
if you guys haven't figured it
out, it's Mike.

210
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,367
>> MICHAEL: Rodger, get the
level out and see how we're

211
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,409
doing.
>> ELISABETH: Okay.

212
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,037
>> DEBB: You can't have one
person step in and start

213
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,122
ordering everybody around,
'cause it's not going to play,

214
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,583
and it's not playing right now,
and not just with me, but with

215
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,419
others.
>> MICHAEL: Here. Push up.

216
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,462
Push that up a little bit,
Rodger, so I can give me a

217
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,257
little...
Push this up a little bit.

218
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,383
>> DEBB: Rodger used to build
homes.

219
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,802
Rodger is the one who helped to
build this shelter.

220
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,136
He knows what he's doing.
Well, Mike comes over and starts

221
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,391
telling him how to build it,
and-and Rodger was like, "No,

222
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,935
that isn't going to work."
>> RODGER: It's going to give us

223
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,144
fall this way plus both
directions.

224
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,938
>> MICHAEL: I mean, do you think
it's enough of a pitch here

225
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:21,026
to... so the rain's going to
come off good?

226
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,071
(<i> grunts</i> )
We're never going to want to

227
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,990
leave this place.
>> RODGER: I don't know about

228
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:37,459
that.
>> Very quickly.

229
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,627
>> Yeah, we're doing really
well.

230
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,087
>> KEITH: All right, so, what
makes the most sense as far as

231
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,089
building where we'd want to
live?

232
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,134
Do we want to live by the water,
or do we want to take a walk up

233
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,260
on the high ground and take a
look at it?

234
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,303
>> MARALYN: Well, there's a lot
of electrical storms.

235
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,013
>> Yeah, good point.
>> There's going to be a lot of

236
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,973
bugs down by the water, though.
>> JERRI: We want to definitely

237
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:51,765
be under some trees, 'cause, I
mean...

238
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,851
>> Okay.
>> JERRI: When the sun comes

239
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,020
out, it's going to be hot.
>> MARALYN: Probably the sun is

240
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,315
going to be out at certain
times, so at certain times,

241
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,649
there's still going to be shade,
based on the position of the

242
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,192
sun.
>> Do you have a compass with

243
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,654
you?
>> KEITH: As soon as we hit the

244
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,031
beach, and it was really kind of
amazing, collectively, we all

245
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:11,535
dispersed to do something
different.

246
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,500
>> JERRI: When we got to our
camp, I was considering at that

247
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,837
point anything and everything
anybody was doing or saying as a

248
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:30,346
strategic move.
>> MITCHELL: Colby-- his luxury

249
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,181
item was the Texan flag, which
was great, because it served as

250
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,560
the tarp that covers... covers
us and blocks us from the wind

251
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,481
and the sun.
>> COLBY: I really did bring the

252
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,360
flag to serve as shelter, but,
you know, don't get me wrong.

253
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,570
When I wake up in the morning,
there's two things I'm thankful

254
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,490
for: I'm thankful I'm alive, and
I'm thankful I'm a Texan.

255
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,201
>> It's not going to work.
>> JERRI: We don't need to risk

256
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,161
ripping this if there's a stick
that's two inches shorter.

257
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,664
>> KEITH: Yeah, you don't need
to go that far, though.

258
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,208
>> JERRI: It was...
No, but it's not going to stay.

259
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,709
That's what I'm saying.
The tension between Keith and

260
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:05,214
I...
I think him and I kind of...

261
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,257
rubbed each other the wrong way.
>> KEITH: Watch, right here,

262
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,843
watch.
Let me just show you.

263
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,969
Right there.
>> KEL: It's sticking now.

264
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,221
>> KEITH: It's set. It's-it's...
That's-that's working.

265
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,389
And before it was here.
>> JERRI: But, see, we put it on

266
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,058
the grommet for a reason: so
that the flag wouldn't rip.

267
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,686
>> KEITH: You can't.
You won't be able to go through

268
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,898
that on a flat surface.
>> JERRI: Keith and I didn't

269
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:27,069
start off on a very good foot,
just because of some of the

270
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,613
condescending mark... remarks he
made to me, and he might very

271
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,117
well not even be aware that he
does it, but I'm not the kind of

272
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,954
person to just let it slide off
my back.

273
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,346
All right, all right.
>> You got to share something

274
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,098
about yourself that's really
embarrassing.

275
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,225
>> Okay.
>> Embarrassing or just deep?

276
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,310
>> KIMMI: I just got naked in a
tent with a bunch of strangers.

277
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,564
>> RODGER: That's what I was
getting ready to say.

278
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,648
>> ALICIA: Give us the dirt,
girl.

279
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,941
>> Like boyfriend, husband,
wife.

280
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:07,901
>> KIMMI: Okay, A, not married.
Don't believe in marriage until

281
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
I'm 35.
>> Okay, don't say you're a

282
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,780
virgin, 'cause I swear to God,
I'll...

283
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,949
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> KIMMI: I'll tell you what my

284
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,576
main concern was: when and how
am I going to masturbate out

285
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,287
here with...
(<i> laughter</i> )

286
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,416
>> You have got to be kidding
me!

287
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,919
>> DEBB: Kimmi is a happy-go-
lucky person who's got...

288
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,297
I-I don't even know how to
describe her.

289
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,465
I don't know what the right word
is.

290
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,508
You know, nothing is taboo with
her-- nothing at all.

291
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,969
>> KIMMI: Listen to me!
You guys might like a skin wig,

292
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,972
however... on occasion.
>> JEFF V.: Kimmi will not shut

293
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:40,309
up.
You know, I'm tired at night.

294
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,186
I want to go to sleep, and
they're constantly talking, and

295
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,981
with the headache that I have,
it just reverberates.

296
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:49,943
Kimmi cannot say a single thing
without screaming it.

297
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:50,944
>> KIMMI: All right, someone
just stuck their finger in my

298
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:51,779
...!
>> DEBB: Well, it was on my

299
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,698
head.
>> JEFF: All of a sudden, out of

300
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,616
the blue, with that accent that
just talks and talks and talks

301
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,328
and talks...
I just want to grab her by the

302
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,997
neck and shake the ... out of
her, you know?

303
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,998
>> KIMMI: Oh, my God, I love
you!

304
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:05,834
I can take my braids out!
And you had a threesome.

305
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,211
We went back-to-back.
You farted in my ... and

306
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:17,304
rebounded it...
>> MICHAEL: I think we're

307
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:31,610
rebounded it...
>> MICHAEL: I think we're

308
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,487
starting to get to know each
other, and people are not

309
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,864
accustomed to this kind of
lifestyle yet.

310
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,449
I'm a little accustomed to this
lifestyle, because I do hunt,

311
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:43,413
and I do fish, and I do camp, so
it's not that foreign to me.

312
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:48,001
Kucha, we got food!
>> Oh, my God.

313
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:48,961
>> Right, like, right under our
noses.

314
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,212
>> Is it better?
>> MICHAEL: Yeah, I think you

315
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,214
can eat 'em.
When I saw those figs, it was a

316
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,216
big rush, and two or three
people came over and helped pick

317
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,053
the figs, and we brought 'em
back, and, uh... I bit into one

318
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:02,057
right off the tree.
(<i> yelling</i> )

319
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,270
(<i> spitting</i> )
(<i> yelling</i> )

320
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,064
Don't!
>> What? What? What?

321
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,775
>> MICHAEL: (<i> spitting</i> )
Don't bite into one.

322
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,943
>> Dang fruit flies.
>> I know.

323
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,403
Well, we're going to put the...
>> Can we eat 'em green?

324
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,573
>> Look at that.
>> That's not bugs, is it?

325
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,032
>> No, that's not bugs.
If they're not...

326
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,286
if they're not moving.
>> JEFF V.: I'm looking at bugs.

327
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,370
>> DEBB: All over the place here
with this.

328
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,914
>> JEFF V.: Let's see.
Mike, he opens up these figs,

329
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,710
and he's... showing us these
bugs, and I'm just wanting to

330
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,920
eat that thing so bad, 'cause
I'm starving, and these bugs are

331
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,633
just creepy and flying around,
and I don't eat anyth...

332
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,428
You know, I-I cook my food.
>> ALICIA: And if the bugs don't

333
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,637
fly out, I'm going to eat them,
so...

334
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,889
>> JEFF V.: Speak for yourself,
baby.

335
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,266
>> DEBB: We very well might be
cold and hungry tonight, but not

336
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,810
if we can help it.
The fire is the most important

337
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,937
thing for survival.
We need to eat, and we need to

338
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:53,275
boil water.
That's all I care about.

339
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,276
If we put enough sand in there,
I think it's good.

340
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,569
Put that cotton right at the
bottom.

341
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,113
>> MICHAEL: Well, the problem is
we get too much sand in here,

342
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,157
we're not... we're... it's
dumping on all of our tinder.

343
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,283
This wood's not going to catch
fire.

344
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,618
The tinder's going to catch
fire.

345
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,785
>> DEBB: Just... you need to
keep that...

346
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,828
>> MICHAEL: But if you keep
putting sand in there, it-it

347
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,455
puts out the tinder.
>> DEBB: I know. It's just that

348
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,957
the book said you needed
friction.

349
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,919
>> KIMMI: Debb works very hard,
and she means well, but she's

350
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,086
like, "Well, in the camping
book, it says to do it like

351
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,465
this."
And-and you know what?

352
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,092
We could have the wrong wood.
We could have the wrong rocks,

353
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,427
something.
She's making herself an

354
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,805
authority on something actively
on what she read and not on

355
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,390
actually doing.
Had she went and practiced this

356
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,519
stuff at home, I would take her
opinion a lot more, you know,

357
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,314
seriously.
>> All right.

358
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,150
>> RODGER: One thing we tried to
do in starting the fire was use

359
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,111
my Bible, which I had brought
along.

360
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,614
It was my luxury item.
And, uh, we tore some pages out

361
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,117
of it.
Uh, it wasn't the pages that

362
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,370
actually had any scripture in
it, but I would've used that.

363
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:50,123
You know, if you're...
You got to do with what you got.

364
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,583
>> Next?
>> I don't know.

365
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,584
I don't...
>> RODGER: Yeah.

366
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,128
There's a letter from my son-in-
law he wrote me.

367
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,838
>> Oh.
>> RODGER: Read it.

368
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,548
I don't have my glasses.
>> KIMMI: Do you want me to read

369
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,384
it to you out loud...
>> RODGER: I don't care.

370
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,843
I can't; I don't have my
glasses.

371
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,011
>> KIMMI: "Dear Dad, best of
luck.

372
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,973
"You have many people who
believe you can do anything you

373
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,557
"put your mind to.
Just be yourself.

374
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,559
"Things'll be fine in Kentucky.
Focus on your task at hand.

375
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,562
"You can do this.
It's not going to be easy, but

376
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,398
"a challenge such as this
shouldn't be easy.

377
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,192
Just try your best."
>> All right.

378
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,611
>> KIMMI: It says "KJA", and
then he put in parentheses

379
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,821
"141", so I don't know if
that...

380
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,906
>> RODGER: 141? Yeah.
>> KIMMI: Oh!

381
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,533
>> That's pretty cool.
>> KIMMI: You got love notes.

382
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,370
>> RODGER: That was a nice
little piece of home when you...

383
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,913
when you least-least expect it,
you know.

384
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,457
Then it said go to page 200, and
then go to page 150, and we went

385
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,253
through that about seven or
eight times, I think, till we...

386
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,380
till we finally came to the end.
>> KIMMI: Can you give us the

387
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,757
page of the burning bush?
>> RODGER: And it was a little

388
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,469
sentimental for me, to tell you
the truth, to... to hear it.

389
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,061
>> I think you wrote the book,
huh?

390
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,229
>> KEITH: My son is in Cub
Scouts.

391
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:57,899
If I start this fire, I will be
his hero.

392
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:06,616
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> COLBY: Ooh, this side got

393
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,202
hot.
>> JERRI: Are we far enough

394
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,704
away from the water?
>> MITCHELL: Just what I was

395
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,622
going to say right there.
>> KEITH: Oh, it doesn't...

396
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,790
I think we start the fire, we
can dig anywhere we want to.

397
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,542
We pull off making the fire...
>> JERRI: Well, I don't even

398
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,253
really want to attempt to start
it until we get it where we want

399
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,254
to keep it.
>> Yeah.

400
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,464
>> JERRI: 'Cause if we move it,
it's going out.

401
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,050
>> KEITH: Well, let me keep
trying on this.

402
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,468
>> JERRI: If you get lucky, and
you spark that thing, and it's

403
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,637
ready to go, and you try and
pick it up and move it, and we

404
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,889
don't have anywhere to put it,
then...

405
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,308
>> KEITH: Then I can just keep
it burning here and a little one

406
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,435
going, and we can always move
this.

407
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,144
>> JERRI: All right, I'm going
to go see if I can find a better

408
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:39,649
place.
>> MITCHELL: Bad news.

409
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,112
>> KEITH: I've never started a
fire before from scratch, but,

410
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,489
you know, I knew nightfall was
coming.

411
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:50,660
We'd have no light, and we'd be
able to cook nothing, um... and

412
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,828
we wouldn't have a bonfire, so
it was... it was pretty

413
00:22:51,912 --> 00:23:00,462
critical.
>> COLBY: Keith is just licking

414
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,297
his chops.
He's wanting to cook so bad, he

415
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,465
can't stand it, and so you can
bet he's going to work on this

416
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:15,143
fire thing until we lick it.
>> AMBER: Uh-oh.

417
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:19,523
>> KEITH: Oh.
Since Jerri and I had our little

418
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,485
confrontation before, I thought,
you know, this is a great time

419
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,695
to get her involved with this
process, to be a part of it

420
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,656
somehow, with something she
brought that was important to

421
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:35,247
her.
>> JERRI: Fire.

422
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,670
Ah!
>> KEITH: (<i> indistinguishable</i> )

423
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:53,348
>> JERRI: Whoo!
>> KEITH: I can feel it.

424
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,893
>> JERRI: Whoo!
Oh, my God!

425
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:01,189
(<i> screams</i> )
>> KEITH: Oh, my God!

426
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,152
>> JERRI: Wow.
Are you guys okay?

427
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:10,031
>> MARALYN: Until we can get a
fire and boil water... we're not

428
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:14,035
going to be eating much of
anything.

429
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,199
>> KIMMI: I got the mail...
>> No way!

430
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,827
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> DEBB: All right! Read it.

431
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,872
Read it to me.
>> Oh, my God.

432
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,041
>> All right, what does it say?
>> KIMMI: "You expected dry

433
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,627
weather, but then you slept in
the rain, and you can't get a

434
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,421
"spark no matter how hard you
strain.

435
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,591
To get your tribe's fire, pay
"heed to this note: the winners

436
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,053
take matches, the losers cast
first the vote."

437
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,846
>> Oh!
>> DEBB: Yeah!

438
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,431
>> ELISABETH: We are getting
matches!

439
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,349
>> When, though? When?
>> We are definitely...

440
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,976
>> Matches!
>> KIMMI: All right, we just got

441
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,980
our notice for the first
immunity challenge, and we're

442
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,775
going to go kick some butt,
'cause we're all together on

443
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,653
this, and we're going to go get
us some fire, and we're going to

444
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,406
go, uh, get us some food.
Fire means food, so that's what

445
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,492
we're going to go do.
We're going to go there, we're

446
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:40,914
going to fight hard and win.
>> ELISABETH: Winning immunity

447
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:47,254
is the most important thing.
We need to... beat, beat, beat

448
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,881
the other tribe.
We'll let them eliminate someone

449
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,260
on their team first.
>> MITCHELL: This immunity

450
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,678
challenge is extremely
important, because we have to

451
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,681
show the other team that we're
better, you know, and plus, we

452
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:03,186
have to have fire in order to
start eating rice.

453
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:13,530
>> JEFF: What's up, guys?
Gather up.

454
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,160
So, uh, anybody have any luck
with fire?

455
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,287
>> ALICIA: No luck.
We came close.

456
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,329
>> Almost.
>> MICHAEL: We got a lot of

457
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,206
smoke.
>> JEFF: All right, I got

458
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,291
something that's going to help
the smoke.

459
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,960
Waterproof matches.
One of the things we're playing

460
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,837
for tonight, right here, a
little canister full.

461
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,007
We're also playing for something
else much more important than

462
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,553
waterproof matches.
Right here: the immunity idol.

463
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,681
You want to know this guy really
well, because the tribe that

464
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,684
wins the immunity idol will not
have to go to Tribal Council and

465
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,853
vote out one of their own
members.

466
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,855
That brings us to challenge
number one.

467
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,815
You're playing for fire.
You're playing for immunity.

468
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,527
There are four legs in the race.
You'll be carrying a lit torch.

469
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,738
If somebody falls in the water
at any time and their torch goes

470
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,699
out, your tribe is done.
Somebody's going home tomorrow.

471
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,869
So that is key.
Here's how the game is played.

472
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,580
First leg starts at the old
bridge.

473
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,540
You'll make your way across
using two planks to help you

474
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:09,044
bridge the gaps.
On the second leg, you'll cross

475
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,171
over the island, where you'll
find, in the water, a small

476
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,507
torch-carrying raft.
Put your lighted torch on the

477
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,551
raft and, as a tribe, swim
across to the other side of the

478
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,888
bank.
When you get over there, you'll

479
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,350
find two sets of wooden rungs.
Take them with you.

480
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,726
For the third leg, you're going
to get on another raft, and

481
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,937
using a rope, pull yourself
across the river.

482
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:32,025
Using the rungs, climb up the
ladder, light the torch.

483
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,402
Winners: maybe a hot meal
tonight, security of knowing

484
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,114
you're going to be here a while.
Losers: cold, somebody's going

485
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,575
to be the first person voted out
of the tribe.

486
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,745
Make sense?
Let's take our spots, wait for

487
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:56,674
my start. Let's go.
All right, at stake, fire... and

488
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,761
immunity!
Survivors, ready?!

489
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,138
>> Ready!
>> JEFF: Go!

490
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,411
>> We won, we won, we won!
Continue to move forward!

491
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,662
Move it forward! Move it
forward!

492
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:34,003
Go, go, go!
>> This is a team.

493
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:44,431
This is a team.
>> Go, go, go, go, let's go.

494
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:54,190
We got it.
>> NICK: Go, go.

495
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,483
Help her a little. Help.
Go, go, go.

496
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:00,530
>> We're even. Go, guys, run.
Go, go, go, go.

497
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:14,752
>> Get the fire.
Hand on the raft.

498
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,882
>> Let's go.
>> Come on, come on!

499
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,304
>> ALICIA: Let's go, let's go.
>> Put your hand on the raft,

500
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:34,355
Kel.
>> RODGER: Okay, I'm okay. Go.

501
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:40,987
Kel.
>> RODGER: Okay, I'm okay. Go.

502
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,699
>> DEBB: Wait.
>> Wait, his foot's caught.

503
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:54,751
Oh, my God.
>> Watch your step, watch your

504
00:29:54,834 --> 00:30:03,551
Oh, my God.
>> Watch your step, watch your

505
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:13,436
step!
>> ALICIA: We're almost there.

506
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:35,750
>> Work, work, work.
>> JERRI: Whoo! Yeah!

507
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:45,843
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> Mitchell.

508
00:30:45,927 --> 00:31:01,109
(<i> cheering</i> )
>> Mitchell.

509
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:10,952
>> Go.
>> Back up, back up.

510
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:17,125
>> Whoo!
>> JERRI: Mitchell!

511
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,504
>> We got it.
Don't lean too far right.

512
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:26,134
>> Good job! You got it!
>> Mitchell!

513
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:34,809
(<i> cheering</i> )
Damn, we're good.

514
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:42,150
Damn, we're good.
>> My God!

515
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,445
>> JEFF: Ogakor,
congratulations.

516
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,447
>> TINA: Whoo!
>> JEFF: Nice work.

517
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,866
>> COLBY: Ow!
>> JEFF: Guys, your reward,

518
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,367
right here: waterproof matches.
>> JERRI: Yeah!

519
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,162
>> AMBER: Yeah!
>> JEFF: And much more

520
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,455
important, I think, you're in
possession...

521
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,832
>> AMBER: Wow...
>> JEFF: ...of the immunity

522
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:01,127
idol.
(<i> cheering</i> )

523
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,129
>> We need to stay positive now,
okay?

524
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:07,175
>> JEFF: Guys, tomorrow,
somebody from Kucha will be the

525
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,886
first person voted out of the
tribe.

526
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,346
You'll have that to think about
tonight.

527
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,805
I know you're already a close
group.

528
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,307
It's going to be a tough
decision.

529
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,350
You guys can head on back to
camp.

530
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:20,021
Ogakor, you guys can light this
up in celebration.

531
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:56,599
>> RODGER: Yesterday's immunity
challenge was a big letdown, uh,

532
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,601
uh, not only physically, but
emotionally.

533
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,270
I think probably more so
emotionally.

534
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,237
As far as the Tribal Council
goes tonight, which are... which

535
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,698
we have to go to, uh, I don't
think any of us are looking

536
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,201
forward to it.
(<i> gagging</i> )

537
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:21,124
(<i> retching</i> )
>> Jeff is not well.

538
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,084
>> ELISABETH: You need to sit
down.

539
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,085
You're so shaky, you're scaring
me.

540
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,254
>> JEFF V.: That's okay.
>> DEBB: I don't know.

541
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,258
I'm not betting on me getting
voted off, but I think it's-it's

542
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:35,430
down to, like, me, Rodger or
maybe, um... Jeff, because he

543
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,598
hasn't been feeling good.
My personal opinion is the

544
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,768
strong survive.
If you were going to vote for

545
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,730
someone, who would you be voting
for right now?

546
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,940
>> RODGER: Jeff.
>> DEBB: Me, too.

547
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:48,401
I really love the guy.
>> RODGER: I like him.

548
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,277
I like him. He's a good kid.
>> DEBB: But he's sick.

549
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,112
He's sick.
>> JEFF V.: Debb. She wants to

550
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,905
go, too, by the way.
>> ALICIA: Really?

551
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,282
>> JEFF V.: Yeah.
>> ALICIA: She told me that you

552
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,952
wanted to go.
She sure did.

553
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,579
>> JEFF V.: What?
>> ALICIA: She told me that you

554
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,539
wanted to go.
>> JEFF V.: That is a bald-faced

555
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,168
lie.
>> ALICIA: Okay, scandalous.

556
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,295
She told me you wanted to go.
>> DEBB: I-I'm going to probably

557
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,504
vote for Jeff.
And I was talking with him

558
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,299
today, you know, and he doesn't
even seem that upset at the

559
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,508
thought of it.
>> RODGER: Yeah.

560
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,968
>> DEBB: He's like... he wants a
pizza and a coke.

561
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,762
>> RODGER: He-he might've...
>> ALICIA: She said, "He's

562
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,139
falling apart, doesn't feel
good."

563
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:18,973
I was like, "Yeah, okay."
>> JEFF V.: Are you kidding me?

564
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,308
>> ALICIA: No, I'm not kidding
you.

565
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,517
I wouldn't tell you that if she
didn't say it.

566
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,978
>> JEFF V.: It's like there's a
part of me that's a little

567
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,605
paranoid about who's talking to
who.

568
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:29,317
I see these two standing over
across, um... Mike and Rodger

569
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,153
standing across the river
talking.

570
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,988
They're not fishing.
They're not doing anything.

571
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:35,323
They're just talking, and uh,
the wheels start turning, and

572
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,159
just... my eyes are going
around.

573
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,161
>> MICHAEL: I mean, it's two
different games, you know?

574
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,704
>> JEFF V.: Just because we've
said what we're doing doesn't

575
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,707
necessarily mean it's going to
happen, and I haven't been with

576
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,836
these people long enough to know
for sure how well...

577
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,172
I mean, I'm not going to trust
anybody, but there's a

578
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,174
certain... to a certain point,
you have to.

579
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,843
>> JEFF V.: I puked on camera.
How embarrassing.

580
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,346
>> MICHAEL: You puked?
>> DEBB: Couple times already.

581
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,349
>> MICHAEL: Did you save it?
>> DEBB: Would you stop?

582
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:15,363
(<i> laughing</i> )
>> KIMMI: It's like going to

583
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,697
court.
Tribal Council is going to

584
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,241
court.
Nobody likes to go to court,

585
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,369
you know, but if you broke the
law, you got to go, and we broke

586
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,205
the law by not winning.
So we, you know, we got to go

587
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,043
face our punishment.
Our punishment... is to get rid

588
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:40,263
of one of our own.
>> MICHAEL: The people that I

589
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,307
think that are in jeopardy
tonight are potentially Jeff,

590
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:48,396
because of the health issues,
and Rodger might not be safe.

591
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,441
He could be a liability in the
challenges, and especially

592
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,403
swimming challenges and climbing
challenges.

593
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,237
And it's not just Rodger.
It would be anybody over 50

594
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,908
years old.
>> JEFF V.: I mean, I-I'm

595
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,910
looking forward to voting
somebody out, 'cause it's the

596
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,912
game, and I'm here to play the
game.

597
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,081
I'm not here to make friends.
I'm not here for that.

598
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,792
People have got to go, and I
look forward to walking up,

599
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,086
writing somebody's name on a
card and talking about 'em.

600
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,713
(<i> laughs</i> )
Um... I'm getting ready to do

601
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:23,764
it.
>> JEFF: Guys, come on in.

602
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:37,737
it.
>> JEFF: Guys, come on in.

603
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,949
We begin your first Tribal
Council with a ritual.

604
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,076
Behind each of you is a torch.
Grab a torch and approach a

605
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,792
flame.
Dip your torches in and... get

606
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,961
some fire, put 'em back in their
slots.

607
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,299
We do this because fire does
represent life here.

608
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,760
These torches will now represent
your life, your identity at

609
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,554
Tribal Council.
You'll bring these torches with

610
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:08,476
you to each Tribal Council, and
the good news is when you return

611
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,438
home tonight, you will have
fire.

612
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,778
Before we get into this, I just
want you guys to take a second

613
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,322
and look around at where we're
at.

614
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,493
We're on top of a granite
waterfall.

615
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,829
Can't think of a more
spectacular place for the drama

616
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,999
that's going to go down here
every three days.

617
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,627
This is where you account for
your actions.

618
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,505
Some of those actions tonight
are going to help you.

619
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,506
Going to stay here a few more
days.

620
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,424
Some of those actions may come
back to haunt you.

621
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,011
One thing's for certain.
One of you guys will be the

622
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,014
first person voted out of a
tribe.

623
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,976
So before we get to that, let's
do a little gauge in how the

624
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,186
first few days were.
Debb, what about finding the

625
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,855
camp?
Was it a celebration or was it

626
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,565
fall down, "I'm exhausted"?
>> DEBB: Celebration.

627
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,026
Celebration.
It was celebration all the way

628
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,696
in.
Hop in the water and then regret

629
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,531
it afterwards when we were
freezing and had no fire.

630
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,701
>> JEFF: Yeah, let's talk a
little about that. Fire.

631
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,577
You've-you've been one really
trying to get this fire going.

632
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,372
Yeah, I been the one trying and
getting no fire.

633
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:15,167
I mean, I've tried everything
those damn books said to do.

634
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,920
The bow, the-the... this thing.
That's crazy.

635
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,965
>> JEFF: Well, you'll have fire
tonight when you go home.

636
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,050
>> DEBB: Yeah, yeah.
That's good to know.

637
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,468
It's been a little cold a couple
nights here.

638
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,681
>> JEFF: Have you guys formed
any impressions about the other

639
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,558
tribe in the limited time you've
seen them?

640
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,561
>> MICHAEL: We haven't really
had a lot of contact with them,

641
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,604
but, uh, right now, we totally
see them as the enemy.

642
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,523
We haven't had a chance to bond
with them.

643
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,234
We haven't had a chance to talk
with them at all.

644
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,569
I didn't even look at 'em when
we lost.

645
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,571
>> NICK: Yesterday's event was
just a physical challenge, and I

646
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,657
would've put money on us any day
to win that challenge, but they

647
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,744
went through, and then we had
problems.

648
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,579
>> JEFF: Rodger, leadership come
up?

649
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,498
Did anybody emerge as a leader?
>> RODGER: Uh, yes.

650
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:58,210
I would say probably, uh, Mike
has.

651
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,422
Uh, uh, as far as building the
hut, I think we both probably

652
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,300
shared in on that, 'cause my
knowledge on that is pretty

653
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:08,262
extensive in-in that I teach a
carpentry class, and, uh...

654
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,890
But overall, I'd say he's
probably taken the lead, and-and

655
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,893
that's fine, 'cause he's a very
knowledgeable person.

656
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,061
We all... we all get along
great.

657
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,605
Tonight is, uh, really a hard
deal for us.

658
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:21,442
Uh, personally, I-I thought that
the first vote off would be

659
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,652
easy, because you would probably
have somebody that would be

660
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,571
slacking, but we just haven't
had that.

661
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,449
I mean, every one of these
people have worked and worked

662
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,660
hard, and that's-that's what
makes tonight's vote so hard.

663
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,080
>> JEFF: All right, it's time to
vote.

664
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,499
Here's how it's going to work.
One by one, you guys will go

665
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,460
across the bridge to the voting
confessional.

666
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,129
You'll write down in big clear
letters the name of the person

667
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,800
you're voting for, hold it up,
speak your peace-- why you're

668
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,511
voting the way you're voting--
then fold it up, put it in the

669
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,640
voting container, come back and
have a seat.

670
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,893
Make sense?
We'll start here with you, Debb.

671
00:39:55,976 --> 00:40:05,945
You're up.
>> DEBB: I love this guy dearly,

672
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:14,870
You're up.
>> DEBB: I love this guy dearly,

673
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,290
but I came here deciding that I
was going to vote on the

674
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,168
strongest surviving.
Jeff's been the sickest of all

675
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,672
of us, and he's still not over
it, so I'm going to vote for

676
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,675
Jeff, and I hate to do it.
I love him.

677
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,942
>> RODGER: No real reason,
actually.

678
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:49,155
She's as hard a worker as
anybody out there, and, uh...

679
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:59,206
somebody had to go.
>> KIMMI: I'm voting for Debb

680
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:28,611
somebody had to go.
>> KIMMI: I'm voting for Debb

681
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,865
because... she's a great worker
and everything, but she does

682
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,618
feel isolated.
You know, when we're together

683
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:39,747
all in the tent at night, she
just chooses... to be

684
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,251
independent, and... she's just a
strong-willed person.

685
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:48,088
It's not a bad thing.
It's just not what I need.

686
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,306
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

687
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,459
I need to remind you that once
the votes are tallied, the

688
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,462
decision is final.
The person will be asked to

689
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,798
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

690
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,801
You'll do so across this bridge
here.

691
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,304
Take the bridge up, over the
rocks, down to a confessional

692
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,848
where you can speak as long as
you want about your time here in

693
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:45,104
the Outback.
I'll read the votes.

694
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:53,112
First vote...
Debb.

695
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:04,957
Debb.
Jeff.

696
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:15,718
Debb.
Four votes for Debb, one vote

697
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:24,018
for Jeff.
First person voted out of the

698
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,563
tribe... is Debb.
No point in revealing the other

699
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:31,483
two votes.
You need to bring your torch.

700
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,905
>> DEBB: Do good. Kick ...
>> JEFF: Over here, Debb.

701
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:49,918
The tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

702
00:43:51,670 --> 00:44:03,015
>> KIMMI: Good-bye, Debb.
>> JEFF: You survived your first

703
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,850
Tribal Council.
Grab your torches.

704
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,770
You'll have fire.
Head back to camp,

705
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:17,863
I'll see you tomorrow.
Stay tuned for scenes from our

706
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:30,376
I'll see you tomorrow.
Stay tuned for scenes from our

707
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,880
next episode.
Next time on<i> Survivor,</i> Kel is

708
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:38,926
accused of smuggling food.
>> MITCHELL: Jerri blatantly

709
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,762
said that she saw something that
looked just like beef jerky.

710
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,098
>> KEL: It was a blade of grass,
and I was chewing on that.

711
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,433
>> JERRI: It was nowhere near
any grass.

712
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,227
>> JEFF: Kimmi struggles with
the immunity challenge.

713
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,938
(<i> screams</i> )
You got cow brain there.

714
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,066
>> KIMMI: I can't eat a brain.
>> You're good.

715
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,859
>> DEBB: I wouldn't have minded
getting voted off if I had

716
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,613
fell... fallen during a
competition, if I was lazy, if I

717
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:03,367
wasn't a team player, but when I
come here, and I give all of

718
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,787
that, and I still get voted off,
I bet you if Jeff had read every

719
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,248
one of those votes, it would
have been seven to one, and

720
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,667
that's-that's a shame.
I still thought a lot of it

721
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,170
boiled down to mental toughness
and physical ability, and none

722
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,673
of that even mattered.
