00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,398
Deshawn with another piece.

173
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,600
Everybody doing a very good job
out of the gate.

174
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,235
-Everybody is in this.
-Doing great. Good job, guys.

175
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,671
-You got this.
-XANDER: Nice and slow.

176
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,408
PROBST:
In the early lead,
it is Sydney and Evvie

177
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,477
both with about the same amount
of progress.

178
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,614
But the further along
you get in this challenge,

179
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,951
-the more difficult it becomes.
-TIFFANY: Good job, you guys.

180
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,653
'Cause it's more likely that
you will knock another block off

181
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,055
while you're trying
to place one.

182
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,523
TIFFANY:
Let's go, Evvie.

183
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:53,592
PROBST:
Evvie now going on
to that third level.

184
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,562
-LIANA: Great job, E.
-TIFFANY: Good job, Evvie.

185
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,297

-Good job, Evvie.

186

Good job, Sydney.

187
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,101
PROBST:
Sydney's on her third level.

188
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,870
Deshawn now moving on
to his third level.

189
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,340
It's Evvie, Sydney,
Deshawn and Ricard

190
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,375
all on the third level
right now.

191
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,177
-Come on.
-We got a challenge.

192
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,778
-Come on, Deshawn.
-Come on, Deshawn.

193
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,513
-We got four people
that are in it.
-Come on, Deshawn.

194
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,848
Here comes Naseer.
He's got his first block,

195
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,416
-but knocks one off.
-Evvie, you got this.

196
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,452
SHAN:
You got this, Ricard...

197
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,354
-ERIKA: Slow and steady, guys.
-PROBST: It is Sydney, Evvie,

198
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,822
-Deshawn and Ricard.
-HEATHER: Slow and steady.

199
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,724
-XANDER: You got it, Deshawn.
-SHAN: Slow and steady.

200
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,192
PROBST:
All four are in it side by side.

201
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,294
Come on, Ricard.

202
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,796
HEATHER:
Yeah, Deshawn.

203
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,931
PROBST:
One mistake could open the door.

204
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,499
(overlapping chatter)

205
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,967
Keep digging, keep fighting.

206
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,803
Evvie with another piece.
Sydney with another piece.

207
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,209
Evvie down to her last piece.
Sydney has two left.

208
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,277
-ERIKA: Nice work.
-HEATHER: Nice work.

209
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,748
HEATHER:
There she is. She's doing great.

210
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,916
Evvie with her last piece.

211
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,418
Now she's got to use both feet

212
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,553
-to get the flag.
-Hey, Evvie, slow, baby girl.

213
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,254
-Wow.
-Wow.

214
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,156
Sydney trying to stay in this.

215
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,391
It is Evvie and Sydney.

216
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,759
-Evvie now with the flag.
-Hardest part.

217
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,428
The hardest part.
Got to get it up and over

218
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,997
the three stacks
using both feet.

219
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,665
-Aah.
-And she knocks a block off.

220
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,067
-ERIKA: It's okay.
-PROBST: That's what
Sydney needed.

221
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,568
-HEATHER: It's okay.
-PROBST: Now Deshawn is in it.

222
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,470
-Ricard now has his last block.
-SHAN: Come on, Ricard!

223
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,938
-HEATHER: Come on, Ricard!
-ERIKA: Come on, Ricard!

224
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,307
-PROBST: It's now
Ricard going for the flag.
-Ooh!

225
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,842
Ricard could pull it out
right here.

226
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,244
It takes a lot of touch.

227
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,413
SHAN:
You need longer on the end.

228
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,580
HEATHER:
Oh.

229
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,082
ERIKA:
It's okay, Evvie.

230
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,351
PROBST:
It's now Sydney
trying to place her flag!

231
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,586
-TIFFANY: Oh, my God.
-LIANA: Oh, my gosh.

232
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,022
PROBST:
Here goes Ricard with his flag.

233
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,091
-Can she get it?
-ERIKA: Oh, wow.

234
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,661
-Careful.
-Got to drop in that slot

235
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,029
without knocking anything over.

236
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,365
(grunting)

237
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,872
It is second by second. Ricard.

238
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,308
-I got it!
-Ricard has it!

239
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,543
Ricard, by seconds,

240
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,511
-wins immunity...
-ERIKA: Wow.

241
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,913
-...over Sydney.
-ERIKA: Wow.

242
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,481
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

243
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,883
Guaranteed a one-in-11
shot at this game.

244
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,653
Guaranteed a spot

245
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,323
-in the final 11.
-Yes! Phenomenal!
-Wow.

246
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,524
-PROBST:
That was an epic finish.
-ERIKA: Wow.

247
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,059
LIANA:
Good job, Syd.

248
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,162

-Congrats. Congratulations.
-Good job, Ricard.

251
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,735
First individual
immunity challenge.

252
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,404
You are safe tonight
at Tribal Council,

253
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,772
cannot be voted out
of this game,

254
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,241
guaranteed a spot
in the final 11. Congrats.

255
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,843
-Take a spot back.

-(indistinct chatter)

257
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,681
PROBST:
So here's what's going
to happen tonight at Tribal.

258
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,549
Everybody goes, everybody votes,
but the only five

259
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,785
who can receive votes are Evvie,

260
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,222
Sydney, Deshawn,
Naseer and Danny.

261
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,390
And now that we are in the
individual portion of the game,

262
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,392
I'm sure the Shot in the Dark
will become

263
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,461
an even more dangerous element.

264
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,164
So, starting tonight,
there are 12 scrolls.

265
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,933
Two of them are safe. Same odds.

266
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,436
One in six. All right, everybody
grab your stuff, head out.

267
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,571
-See you tonight at Tribal.
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Jeff.

No, no, it ha...
No, it hasn't been that.

00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,818
We drew rocks, we competed,

340

344
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,255
-She glues Xander
and Tiffany together.
-Tiff.

345
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,291
A voting bloc, and she's also
persuasive and strategic.

346
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,326
Unfortunately, we both realize

347
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,761
-that there's going to be blood.
-Okay. Okay.

348
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,329
So you're-you're just
the first one to spill blood.

349
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,664
-I know.
-And then you just have to...

350
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,299
-I mean...
-And that's fine

351
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,067
-because we're still
the majority.
-But how do you feel?

352
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,939
...we have a different
perspective of the game,

353
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,407
different logic of the game.

354
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,042
When I want to strike,
she wants to play it cool.

355
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,611

Before the votes are cast,
she can ask any person,

"Do you have an idol?" And you
would have to give it to her.

410

This is part of the ritual

I'll tell you this, Jeff.

565
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,798
I've played

top five automatically.
-Really?

-Absolutely.
-Wow. Give us insight

568

because you have a history and
a life that most people don't.

-Well... well, you walk in,

honestly, kind of a miracle

at that point.

583
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,414
LIANA:
I'd say maybe, like,
five minutes or so, and

584
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,716
it's crazy 'cause I've watched
it through my TV,

585
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,818
but watching it happen live
in front of you,

586
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,487
you're like,
"What the hell?"

587
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,122
It's crazy. It was absolutely...

588
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,857
-It was undescribable.
-How do you

589
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,625
describe it, Tiffany? Because

590
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,794
this comes up a lot,
and players will say,

591
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,096
"You can't describe it,
but it's madness.

592
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,931
TIFFANY:
Um, I would say that madness

593
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,267
looks like 12 people who

594
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,036
have no idea who to trust,

595
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,538
want to believe that they trust
the people that they

596
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,807
came to know
through this experience,

597
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,810
but this is the part of the game
that I think is<i> Survivor.</i>

598
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,412
And you can draw a rock

599
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,847
and get put on a tribe
with four girls,

600
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,849
and you get nothing.

601
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,886
And then the other people
who go in-- they get everything,

602
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,588
and then it's taken away from
them. So, I mean, in my mind,

603
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,724
it's Season 41. Of course she's
coming back with something.

604
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,492
I just think we didn't think
it was the something

605
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,528
that she came back with.

606
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,029
SHAN:
And then also, Season 41

607
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,831
has come with a ton
of advantages,

608
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,332
including the Shot in the Dark.

609
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,268
So it's like,
even if you have the numbers,

610
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,969
you just don't know
what someone's carrying in...

611
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,471
with them in their arsenal,

612
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,207
and it can just turn the game
on its head

613
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:32,110
completely, so,
numbers only go so far.

614
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,511
It's-it's relationships,
and I think it's...

615
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,313
it's all those excursions

616
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,515
and journeys that
everybody's been on, you know?

617
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,384
-So...
-PROBST: Deshawn,

618
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,719
finally, somebody said it--
relationships.

619
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:45,723
It comes down to, "Who
do I think I can really trust

620
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,159
when everybody's telling me
I can trust them?"

621
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,061
DESHAWN:
Yeah, I mean,

622
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,997
I came into this game,
like, basing my gameplay

623
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,632
on the social dynamics
of things.

624
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,369
It just gets complicated when
you feel so secure in something,

625
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,505
and it gets flipped,
and now you're one

626
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,574
of five people who...
who can get chosen to go home.

627
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,075
I'm not complaining
about it, Jeff.

628
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,111
I made it this far, and
that's... that's dope for me.

629
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,079
That's really cool,
but I just wish

630
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,614
there was more, like, value

631
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,416
in what I brought to the game
in terms of my social abilities,

632
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,051
but that's all.
That's all I'm saying.

is by using your idol

661
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,425
to protect people that
you absolutely trust. And so,

662
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,793
as a Yase member, like,

663
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,128
that's something that, you know,

664
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,663
I think
we all hold dear to our heart--

665
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,798
-that we protect our own.
-EVVIE: And I think

666
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,333
kind of the interesting thing
about idols

667
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,036
this season, like, I knew
that Xander didn't have a vote

668
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,371
for a long time on Yase,
you know?

669
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,440
And I was never gonna let him go
because he didn't have a vote.

670
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,176
So this is, like, a relationship
that we built in the game, and

671
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:48,179
-that's how you play the game.
-Evvie, love you, girl.

672
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,215
Uh, but I'll just say,
she pretty much

673
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,850
told me everything that was
happening on the tribe, and

674
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,886
I knew that Xander had the idol
before I even met the guy.

675
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,487
And that was because of Evvie.

676
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,591
So, I get what she's saying,
but are you playing both sides

677
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,427
of the fence? Like, where does
your loyalty really lie?

678
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,262
PROBST:
Xander, did you know

679
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,730
Deshawn knew you had an idol?

680
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,966
I didn't know that.
It's an interesting point.

681
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,436
I just thought that I've known
Evvie the longest, so,

682
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,771
I figured that meant
that I could trust her the most.

683
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,408
Dude, and you can,
and you can, and I, like...

684
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,677
Clearly, I regret telling him
that, but the reality is,

685
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,613
you and me are in this together,
and we've been,

686
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,781
and I've been with you,
you know, this whole game.

687

And to that point, I think

688
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,952

is super strong,

00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,787
