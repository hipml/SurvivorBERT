00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,627
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,963
<i>Survivor,</i> Ozzy was in the best

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,756
position to make it to the final

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,216
four.

5
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,884
He was in an alliance with the

6
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,636
five remaining favorites.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,762
>> I trust them, and you've got

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,888
to be able to trust some people

9
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:14,723
in this game.

10
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:15,890
>> PROBST: And he had the hidden

11
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,101
immunity idol.

12
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,644
His only competition seemed to

13
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,104
be Jason, who beat him in the

14
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,856
first individual immunity

15
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:23,773
challenge.

16
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,774
Nice work.

17
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,984
At the second individual

18
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,527
immunity challenge, it was down

19
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,946
to Jason and Parvati when food

20
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,781
was offered to the entire tribe

21
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,908
if one of them dropped out.

22
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:34,701
>> Jason!

23
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,285
You can make friends!

24
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,202
>> I won't vote you out.

25
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,120
>> PROBST: Then everyone in the

26
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,664
tribe promised Jason they would

27
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,791
spare him if he stepped down.

28
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,168
>> I'll guarantee.

29
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,253
>> PROBST: Jason took the deal,

30
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,796
giving up a chance at individual

31
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,590
immunity in order to improve his

32
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,883
position within the tribe.

33
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:50,675
>><i> Bon appétit.</i>

34
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,885
>><i> Bon appétit.</i>

35
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,886
>> PROBST: The favorites agreed

36
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,721
to vote Jason out anyway.

37
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,181
>> We'd have to be idiots not to

38
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,266
vote him out tonight.

39
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,309
>> PROBST: But Parvati decided

40
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,686
to double-cross Ozzy instead.

41
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,729
>> I'm going to have to be

42
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,688
untrustworthy and disloyal no

43
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,564
matter what.

44
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,315
>> PROBST: She recruited

45
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,525
everyone but James, Amanda, and

46
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:13,948
Erik and took Ozzy completely by

47
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,784
surprise.

48
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,993
Tenth person voted out of

49
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,495
<i>Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites</i>

50
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,537
and the second member of our

51
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,499
jury, Ozzy.

52
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,045
Ozzy, the tribe has spoken.

53
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,296
Eight are left.

54
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,673
Who will be voted out tonight?

55
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,979
>> I understand why it happened.

56
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:45,814
But when you think about it,

57
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,315
like, a blindside, it only works

58
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,566
if it's airtight.

59
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,359
>> Right.

60
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,860
>> And obviously, like, I felt

61
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,444
obligated to Ozzy, so I would

62
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,946
have told him.

63
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:53,988
I probably would have told him,

64
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:54,656
and I think you guys did the

65
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,365
right decision for... to pull

66
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,158
that off.

67
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,827
I don't know where Amanda is

68
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,786
right now.

69
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,829
She totally, like, took off

70
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,621
somewhere.

71
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,580
>> Yeah.

72
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,665
>> And she's probably bumming

73
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,084
like crazy.

74
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,836
>> It's just another game.

75
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,962
>> Sometimes you got to pull the

76
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,046
punches.

77
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,005
>> Yeah.

78
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:11,422
>> They got it.

79
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:11,714
It's funny.

80
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,882
I like it.

81
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,300
It was a good move by everybody.

82
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,636
>> I'm very upset about what

83
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,762
happened last night.

84
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,264
What nerve for Cirie and Parvati

85
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,558
to go behind my back and vote

86
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,225
out Ozzy, making me look like an

87
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,352
idiot and the rest of my

88
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,437
alliance looking like idiots

89
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,481
because we voted for Jason.

90
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,024
You know, it's like Parv and

91
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,861
Cirie and Alexis and Natalie are

92
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,029
an alliance now, and I think

93
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,031
they want the men out of here.

94
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:37,991
I thought we were fine up until

95
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,909
those votes, and then another

96
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,827
Ozzy came up, and I was like,

97
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,871
"What the hell?"

98
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,624
Every single person here wanted

99
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,209
to vote for Jason.

100
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,085
It definitely told me that

101
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:49,711
they're here to play this game.

102
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,088
Game on.

103
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,882
Bring it on.

104
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,134
Like, let's do this.

>> So hot.

110
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,860
>> I know.

111
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,070
If you give me one, I can add

112
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,112
one from over this side.

113
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:02,283
It's not so hot.

114
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,202
What is that, meat on your

115
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,788
finger hanging off like that?

116
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,872
>> Yeah.

117
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,915
I'm trying to put coconut juice,

118
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,083
coconut oil.

119
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,376
>> Oh, oh.

120
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,794
James's finger wasn't really

121
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,920
doing too good.

122
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,129
He's had this cut on it for a

123
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,882
few days now.

124
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,550
It was kind of swollen and kind

125
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,094
of infected.

126
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,013
You cannot just assume, "Oh,

127
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,724
this little cut, it's okay.

128
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,018
So what, we're living in a damp,

129
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,146
nasty cave with rats and bats

130
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,523
around us every 15 minutes.

131
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,609
No, this'll be fine."

132
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,202
>> I just did three loops around

133
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,412
the island looking for your ass.

134
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,038
>> Who are you talking to?

135
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:49,914
>> You.

136
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,041
Where were you?

137
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,168
Oh, my God!

138
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,129
I need to do some serious damage

139
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,422
control today.

140
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,923
James and Amanda are pissed at

141
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,260
me, furious for voting Oz out.

142
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:02,969
But I made my bed.

143
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,012
I have to lie in it.

144
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,430
I knew as soon as I made this

145
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,764
move, things were going to get

146
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,561
crazy.

147
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,103
>> Where are you going with

148
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,396
this?

149
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,772
>> Where am I going with what?

150
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,149
>> The paranoia got to you and

151
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,942
you just made a big move.

152
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,401
>> What?

153
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,610
>> I mean, you'll be all right.

154
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,154
>> I couldn't win against Ozzy.

155
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,071
I would be a fool to have kept

156
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,198
him in the game.

157
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,033
>> What is your plan?

158
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,034
Who are you taking with you?

159
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,577
I'm just curious to know.

160
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:27,869
>> To three?

161
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:28,453
>> Yeah.

162
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,414
>> Girls.

163
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,000
>> Yeah, I figured that.

164
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:34,959
>> I just wanted to say sorry

165
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,294
because I couldn't tell you.

166
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:36,961
>> No, sorry's not what you

167
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,421
mean.

168
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,964
Ha-ha's what you mean.

169
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,548
>> Well, I wanted to talk to

170
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,091
you, because I like you.

171
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:42,800
I didn't want it to be, like,

172
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,384
completely awkward.

173
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,470
>> Oh, it's going to be awkward.

174
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,848
It's just funny.

175
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,183
There's always one that always

176
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,309
got to eat the apple, can't just

177
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,393
leave the apple alone and just

178
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,478
enjoy the heavens.

179
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,645
No, you got to chew on that

180
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,731
apple.

181
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,114
>> Yeah, hopefully, because you

182
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,240
wouldn't give me credit for

183
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,242
having a plan anyways.

184
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,077
>> Why would I think that?

185
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,078
>> Because that's pretty much

186
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:10,912
how you've been acting towards

187
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,662
me this whole time.

188
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,497
>> That's a lie.

189
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,247
>> That I'm stupid.

190
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,207
>> No, I didn't say you were

191
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,124
stupid.

192
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:15,917
I said you were selfish, not

193
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,459
stupid.

194
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,418
I mean, you can lie to me, you

195
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,211
can fool me, you can deceive

196
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,087
don't.

197
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,921
Don't insult your intelligence.

198
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,464
Don't try to act like you're

199
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,632
going to pull the wool over my

200
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,092
eyes with self-pity.

201
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,218
Just don't come up here trying

202
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,344
to give me a bunch of bluff.

203
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:26,969
>> I just wanted to talk to you,

204
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,096
honestly.

205
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,055
>> Huh?

206
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,014
>> I just wanted to talk to you.

207
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,516
>> And you have.

208
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,892
By her pulling that just showed

209
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,310
me who she really is.

210
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:34,852
Do I put up with people like

211
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,229
that?

212
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,230
No.

213
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:37,939
That's what kind of person she

214
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,815
is, and that's who we're dealing

215
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,901
with, and I just can't stand it.

216
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:46,906
>> I feel really bad that I

217
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,491
couldn't tell you last night.

218
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,660
I know, like, you feel really

219
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,744
out of the loop, but, like,

220
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,287
you're not.

221
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,039
>> What is the plan?

222
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:55,456
>> I'm thinking...

223
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,542
>> Because obviously it's the

224
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,294
girls together, right?

225
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,045
>> I'm thinking final five

226
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,714
girls, you know?

227
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,174
>> I don't want Parvati to know

228
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,676
that I'm mad at her, because

229
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,302
Parvati is pretty much running

230
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:08,803
the show at this point.

231
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,595
She has Natalie and Alexis

232
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,098
wrapped around her finger, and

233
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,182
Cirie didn't even tell me that

234
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,685
she was voting for Ozzy.

235
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,103
So she's got little Cirie

236
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,147
wrapped around her finger.

237
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,772
You know, I just hope that we're

238
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,066
all still cool.

239
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,942
>> Yeah.

240
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,152
>> That's what I'm coming down

241
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:24,694
here for, because I can tell

242
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,197
you're not happy.

243
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,198
>> I understand.

244
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:29,740
Like, I really understand.

245
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,075
>> Uh-huh.

246
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:31,659
>> I hope you guys trust me.

247
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,786
>> No, no, we totally trust you.

248
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,956
It's just with Ozzy and not

249
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,874
wanting him... we knew you

250
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,666
probably didn't want him to go

251
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,917
just yet.

252
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,127
>> So is it still, like, us

253
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,170
three to the end?

254
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,129
>> I say yeah.

255
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:43,713
>> I don't see why not.

256
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,339
>> Okay, yeah.

257
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,215
>> Yeah.

258
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:46,799
>> All right.

259
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,217
>> You know I love you, "Legs."

260
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,177
Oh, I feel so bad for you.

261
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,635
You look so sad.

262
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,595
>> You know, I'd like to believe

263
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,598
them, but obviously, they have

264
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,099
other plans right now that I'm

265
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,726
not aware of, and it'd be stupid

266
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,395
of me to buy what they're

267
00:07:59,478 --> 00:07:59,854
telling me right now.

268
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,605
This is where the game gets

269
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,900
interesting.

270
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:07,904
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

271
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,781

00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,380
money to bid on items.

281
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,798

increments.

283

There is no sharing of money or

That's the secret.

372
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,382
You get past the skin, you're

373
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,509

Sold!

395
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,910
It's amazing the value you put

396
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,329
on food when you don't have it.

397
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,499

Natalie.

407
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,015
$240 bought you this.

408
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:23,265

immediately, and you take all of

415
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,318
the money they have left."

416
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,529
>> Damn!

417
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,071
>> I've been there twice.

418
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,739
I don't want to go back.

Please!

420
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,410
>> Well, is the idol replanted

421
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,786
since it wasn't ever played?

422
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,122
>> PROBST: Because Ozzy was

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,375
the idol and he never played it,

425
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,793
that idol is dead.

426
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,378
A new idol has been hidden.

427
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,214
New clues await.

428
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:59,051
>> Um...

429
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,845
Jason.

430
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,346

Jason, if he gets the immunity

435
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:06,976
idol.

436
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,811
Like, I don't know why he's

437
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,980
tripping.

438
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:11,856
>> PROBST: That's true.

439
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,440
This time maybe you'll get a

440
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,401
real one.

441
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,444
All right, Jason, give your

442
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,070
money to Natalie.

443
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:18,821
You can head out the same way

444
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,697
you came in.

445
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,615
The boat's waiting for you.

446
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:21,949
>> Bye, Jason.

447
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,868

00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:52,480
sold to Natalie.

468
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,064
Looks like Jason's cash just

469
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,110
came in very handy.

470
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,446
>> Oh!

471
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,906

cake for Natalie.

473
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,037
Now, I said this item has

474
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,624
another layer to it.

475
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,417
>> What the hell is that?

476
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,210
>> PROBST: It's a note.

477
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:14,793
Turn around and read it to the

00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,419
group.

479
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,672
>> Oh, not that again.

480
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,673
>> Okay.

485
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,429
Parvati and Alexis and Cirie.

486
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,555
Okay.

487
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,474
Seriously, don't hog the cake.

488
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,725
I haven't had any food.

489
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,559
>> No way.

490
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,352
>> I'm a little aggro right now,

491
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,019
okay?

492
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:32,645

You get the first taste.

495
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:34,855
>> Oh, my God.

496
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,150
Do it right, mama!

497
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,444
Yeah!

501
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,658
Sit down.

502
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,200
I'll tell you when your 60

503
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:46,784
seconds starts.

504
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,701
Don't eat yet.

505
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,246
Go back over there.

506
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,165
You guys ready?

507
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,500
60 seconds starts now.

508
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,292
Go.

509
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,710

510
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:01,257
>> Mm!

511
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,174

00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:02,925
to lick their fingers when

513
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,009
they're done.

You better start shoving cake

518
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,601
down.

519
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,602
Whatever is in your mouth you

520
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,144
can finish.

521
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:14,770
Everything else you've got to

522
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:14,937
drop.

523
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,568
Five seconds, four, three, two,

524
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,612
one, and you're done.

525
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,489
>> Oh!

526
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,282
>> Awesome!

527
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:26,991
>> That's just too much

528
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:27,283
chocolate.

529
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,702
I'm sorry.

530
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,411
>> Erik?

531
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:30,995
>> Yeah.

532
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:31,996
>> How much did you say you were

533
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,746
going to pay?

534
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,497
>> I'd say 20 bucks to lick your

535
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,373
fingers.

536
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,165
>> 20 a finger?

537
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,584
>> All right, how about 40 bucks

538
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,042
to lick your fingers?

539
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,836
>> He's serious!

540
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,920
>> Okay, uh-huh.

541
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,922
>> Oh, baby.

542
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,340
>> "Oh, baby."

543
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,216
>> Oh, that's sad.

544
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,135
>> Mm, mm, mm.

545
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,219
>> Something's wrong with that

546
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,054
boy.

547
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,014
He really has problems, poor

548
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,932
thing.

549

>> Like, I should not have sent

552
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,206
him, but I didn't think anybody

553
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,876
else wanted to miss out.

554
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,585
>> I'd have gone.

555
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,794
>> I was looking at everybody,

556
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,754
and nobody was giving me an

557
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,212
answer.

558
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:22,504
>> I know.

I'm going to lose it.

562
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,676
>> Y'all shouldn't be worried

563
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,637
unless he's, like, really good

564
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,388
with clues and puzzles.

565

We all want him gone.

567
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,352
The little bitch now has two

days of sunshine with the

569
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,022
immunity idol.

00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,774
Guaranteed, hands down, bitch

571
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,358
will find it, and that bitch

572
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,234
being Jason.

573
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,069
>> Hey, I'm not kidding.

574
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,028
I say we check his bag when he

575
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,613
gets back-- like, immediately,

576
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,656
because it'll come just in his

577
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,365
pants.

578
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,199
>> Definitely, like, the second

579
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,493
we see him.

580
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,245
>> Yes!

581
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,163
He has been on the biggest lucky

582
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,831
streak I have ever seen of

583
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,791
anyone.

584
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,708
If there was a lottery right

585
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,209
now, he'd be winning it.

586
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,794
>> Well, it'd better rain.

587
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,711
Like, if I want rain at all,

588
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,420
it's tonight.

589
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,673
>> Seriously.

590
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,228
>> "To find the idol that you

591
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,062
seek, go north to a familiar

592
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,189
location.

593
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,732
You must step up but look for

594
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,608
cracks to find your

595
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,694
destination."

596
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,697
Well, doesn't seem too hard.

597
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,030
Go down there.

598
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,075
If my time out here goes similar

599
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,327
to my last time out here finding

600
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,287
the fake hidden immunity idol,

601
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,539
you know, I should find it in a

602
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,708
breeze.

603
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,625
Number two.

604
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,752
So far, the game has thrown me

605
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,671
so many curves balls.

606
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,296
But since stepping down from the

607
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,049
last immunity challenge, I think

608
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,050
things have definitely changed

609
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,971
for me out here.

610
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,681
I was a little bummed right away

611
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,558
when Natalie chose me, but

612
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,268
hopefully Natalie sent me out to

613
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,520
Exile Island so that I could

614
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,856
find it in the event that

615
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,107
Natalie and I might work

616
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,525
together in using the hidden

617
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,318
immunity idol.

618
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,737
Okay, back across the waterway

619
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,238
there.

620
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,322
I believe that I can trust

621
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,950
Natalie in the fact that, one,

622
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,201
she kept her word to me at last

623
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,704
tribal council when we voted out

624
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,914
Ozzy, and it's in her best

625
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,457
interest to keep me along in

626
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,083
this game.

627
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,003
There you go.

628
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,803
Oh!

629
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,264
Yes!

630
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,269
I feel pretty stupid falling for

631
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,812
the fact that Ozzy made me a

632
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,522
fake idol.

633
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,733
This is not the fake hidden

634
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,318
immunity idol, and the decision

635
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,904
of Natalie to send me to Exile

636
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,739
Island was a strategic move on

637
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,114
her part.

638
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,575
I feel like for the first time

639
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,201
in the game, I'm actually part

640
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,746
of a successful alliance.

641
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,706
Right now I feel the most

642
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,791
comfortable I've felt in the

643
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,418
entire game.

644
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,767
>> Yeah.

645
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,810
>> You know, we have to act as

646
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,936
if Jason has the idol.

647
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,354
>> Yeah.

648
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,772
>> We need to have a plan.

649
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,523
>> As far as the idol goes,

650
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,398
like, I don't want anything

651
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,191
bouncing off and getting one of

652
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:29,358
us.

653
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,026
>> I mean, if Jason doesn't win

654
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,236
tomorrow, cool, as planned.

655
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,237
>> Right, but just in case he

656
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,238
has the idol, we still have to

657
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,323
split the vote.

658
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:40,994
>> Even if we can convince him

659
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,578
that someone else needs to win

660
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,164
this challenge besides him,

661
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,666
let's do it.

662
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,000
Like, whatever we need to do.

663
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:47,835
>> Yeah.

664
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:48,794
>> We have to get into his head,

665
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,628
or else I don't think he's going

666
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:49,878
to lose.

667
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,754
>> Yeah, I agree.

668
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,797
I think we can get in his head.

669
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,422
>> He won't buy anything I say

670
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:52,756
to him, so...

671
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,091
>> Nat can say it.

672
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,009
I know he'll believe Nat.

673
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:56,593
>> We've concocted a beautiful

674
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,889
plan to disarm Jason's lack of

675
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,266
trust, make him feel

676
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:02,808
comfortable, make him feel

677
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,101
comfortable enough.

678
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,812
So we want to blindside him with

679
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,689
not using his immunity and

680
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,024
allowing one of us to win;

681
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,776
therefore, he doesn't win, and

682
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,777
he's out.

683
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,987
Worst-case scenario, he has to

684
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,406
play his idol, and he stays, but

685
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,283
at least his idol's up and out.

686
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,034
You know, before the next

687
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,120
immunity, as soon as I see

688
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,371
Jason, be like, "Dude, I saved

689
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,622
your ass once.

690
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,206
I basically gave you the

691
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,207
immunity idol.

692
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,002
You owe me."

693
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,004
>> That's all you have to say.

694
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:32,796
>> I just think that it's

695
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,797
similar to Ozzy in the sense

696
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,423
that we have one chance to

697
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,010
blindside him.

698
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,803
>> Yeah.

699
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,054
>> At this point, Jason would be

700
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,014
an idiot not to believe anything

701
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:42,222
I say.

702
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,348
He thinks that I'm warming up to

703
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:47,811
him, which I am absolutely not.

704
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,104
If this goes, I mean, this will

705
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,439
just be brilliant, because not

706
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,231
only will it happen... have

707
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,233
happened once with Ozzy; it'll

708
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,818
happen twice, back to back,

709
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,821
girls against the guys.

710
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,323
(<i> laughter</i> )

711
00:19:59,406 --> 00:19:59,907
>> That's, like, freaking...

712
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,074
>> Genius!

713
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:01,950
>> ...genius.

714
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,452
>> Hell hath no furry.

715
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,431
>> "Deja vu, this may feel

716
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,141
familiar.

717
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:26,683
Don't panic, but still you'd

718
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,310
better hurry.

719
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,145
If you haven't learned from the

720
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,313
past, you may be the next to

721
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,065
join the jury."

722
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:33,941
Hmm.

723
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,108
>> Got to win.

724
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,902
>> Got to win.

725
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,402
It's day 30.

726
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,280
It's my 22nd birthday, and I

727
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,531
really think I need to compete

728
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,574
well this time.

729
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,785
If Jason wins immunity today, I

730
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,994
have a feeling that it's either

731
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,287
me or James on the chopping

732
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,374
block for tribal council, simply

733
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,376
because the women are very

734
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,669
strong right now.

735
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,461
I really need to get ferocious

736
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,212
on this.

737
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:55,837
I really need to try my best,

738
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,505
because I feel like I could be

739
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,465
gone on my birthday, and that

740
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,800
would be terrible.

741
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,342
Big, green birthday present.

742
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,302
>> Happy birthday.

743
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,388
>> Happy birthday.

744
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,473
>> I wish we had stuff we could

745
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,599
give you.

746
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:07,849
>> I know.

747
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,602
I do too.

748
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,728
>> He's like, "Tell me about

749
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,938
it."

750
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,730
>> Hey, babe.

751
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,439
>> This challenge is vital in

752
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,901
all the other steps leading up

753
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,486
to the end of this game for the

754
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,362
girls.

755
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:20,946
>> What else is in there, Nat,

756
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,446
anything?

757
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,240
>> No key, I hope.

758
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:23,991
>> A key and a chain.

759
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,617
>> Oh, no.

760
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,493
>> A lock and chain.

761
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,036
I don't want to do any diving.

762
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,413
>> If all goes to plan, Jason

763
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,039
will feel comfortable enough not

764
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,166
to play his idol and he will not

765
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,168
win immunity today.

766
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,920
So he's done.

767
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,505
Worst-case scenario, James goes

768
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,340
home tonight in lieu of Jason,

769
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,510
if we can't get Jason.

770
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,511
So it's either James or Jason

771
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,179
tonight.

772
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,015
And as evil as women can be and

773
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,642
diabolical and cutthroat and go

774
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,519
for the jugular as women are and

775
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,396
just suck blood, we do want Erik

776
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:54,980
to have a good birthday on day

777
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,189
30.

778
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:56,940
Today's his birthday.

779
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,441
He's 22.

780
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,360
So he's not going home today.

781
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,457
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

782
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,011
We'll now bring in Jason,

783
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,389
returning from Exile Island.

784
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,641
>> How was the line?

785
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,476
Be honest.

786
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,310
>> Welcome back.

787
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,227
>> Hi, guys.

788
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:34,978
>> Howdy.

789
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,063
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

790
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,439
to today's immunity challenge?

791
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,023
>> Yeah.

792
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:38,774
>> Yeah.

793
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,357
>> PROBST: First things first.

794
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,651
Parvati, take back the necklace.

795
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,202
Once again, immunity is back up

796
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,287
for grabs.

797
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,580
For today's challenge, all eight

798
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,539
of you will race to throw rocks

799
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,209
at tiles.

800
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,335
When you break your tile, you'll

801
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,544
drop a bundle of puzzle pieces.

802
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,047
The first four to break their

803
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,091
tile move on to the next round,

804
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,884
where you will dig for a key to

805
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,594
unlock the puzzle pieces.

806
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,304
You'll then assemble the wheel,

807
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,015
place it onto a winch, then spin

808
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,059
the wheel to lower a set of two

809
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,602
planks.

810
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,062
The first two to lower their

811
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,939
planks move on to the final

812
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,564
round, where you will use those

813
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,110
planks to cross a rope bridge.

814
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,319
You'll then make your way across

815
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,612
a series of discs and to the

816
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,697
finish platform.

817
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,366
First person to the platform

818
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,118
wins immunity, is guaranteed at

819
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,370
least one more day in this game.

820
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,496
Losers, tribal council, somebody

821
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,456
going home.

822
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,832
Draw for spots.

823
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,960
We'll get started.

824
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,397
>> PROBST: Here we go.

825
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,856
This is for immunity.

826
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,275
The first four people to break

827
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:03,859
their tile move on to the next

828
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,526
round.

829
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,485
Survivors ready?

830
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,656
Go!

831
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,699
Yellow's in.

832
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,784
Jason's moving on.

833
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,912
Erik's moving on.

834
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,581
James is moving on.

835
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,207
We're looking for one more

836
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,334
person, and it is Amanda.

837
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,711
Amanda, James, Erik, and Jason

838
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:31,678
moving on to the next round.

839
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,637
Here we go.

840
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,973
The first two to lower their

841
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,641
planks and cross the black line

842
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,601
move on to the final.

843
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,518
Survivors ready?

844
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,396
Go!

845
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,106
You're looking for a key, one

846
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,192
key.

847
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,113
James has his key.

848
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,698
Erik has his key.

849
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,866
James and Erik both have their

850
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,658
keys.

851
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,577
Got to unwrap them, then unlock

852
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,662
those puzzle pieces.

853
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,997
Jason's found his key.

854
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,583
He's working on it.

855
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,751
James has his lock undone.

856
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,711
Amanda is still digging.

857
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,712
>> Hey, where is it?

858
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,630
>> PROBST: Erik has his lock

859
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,506
open.

860
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,132
James working on the puzzle, has

861
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,635
it together quickly.

862
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,726
Erik working on his puzzle.

863
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,895
James and Erik both lowering

864
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,605
their planks.

865
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,315
Two people are moving on.

866
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:25,941
Amanda still digging for that

867
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,859
key.

868
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,611
Jason trying to get his puzzle

869
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,154
together, quickly falling out of

870
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,572
it.

871
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,616
Got to hit the table.

872
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,910
James, you're good!

873
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,869
James unclips.

874
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,538
James moving on.

875
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,540
Erik, you're good.

876
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,959
Erik unclips and moving on.

877
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,626
James and Erik moving on to the

878
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,379
final.

879
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,300
Here we go.

880
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,801
It is James and Erik for

881
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,678
immunity.

882
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,929
Survivors ready?

883
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,265
Go!

884
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,266
Got to make your way across

885
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,726
using your planks.

886
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,480
Very different strategies.

887
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,856
James trying to go sideways,

888
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,275
trying to keep his balance, and

889
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,109
it doesn't work.

890
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:09,859
James is in.

891
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:14,781
Got to go back to the start.

892
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,408
>> Don't knock Erik over.

893
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,534
You're going to knock him over.

894
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,410
>> PROBST: James loses his

895
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,494
plank, got to get back, losing a

896
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,538
lot of time.

897
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,539
James tried a strategy that did

898
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,748
not work.

899
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,500
Erik doing something similar,

900
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,126
going from the side, but he's

901
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,752
using his knees.

902
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:32,007
James trying a new strategy,

903
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,883
struggling to hang on.

904
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,634
Erik not panicking at all,

905
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,304
taking his time, keeping that

906
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,681
lead.

907
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,765
Immunity and a one-in-seven shot

908
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,600
for the winner of this

909
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,311
challenge.

910
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,145
Erik doing a good job of going

911
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,730
slow and easy.

912
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,815
James is in the role of having

913
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,358
to move quickly, try and make up

914
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,236
ground, take some risks.

915
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,738
He's gaining on Erik.

916
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,989
Erik now going back to riskier

917
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,325
moves.

918
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,617
Instead of one plank at a time,

919
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,536
he's skipping.

920
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,620
James making up some ground

921
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,788
again.

922
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,789
>> ...the rest of the way.

923
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,166
>> PROBST: James is back in it.

924
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:06,833
>> Oh, oh, oh, oh.

925
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,792
>> PROBST: Erik getting very

926
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,878
close.

927
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,838
Erik to the platform.

928
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,714
Now he's got to make his way

929
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,466
across the discs.

930
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,593
James to the platform.

931
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,552
James has got to get across the

932
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,053
discs.

933
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,388
First to the pole.

934
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,349
Erik wins immunity!

935
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:22,849
(<i> applause</i> )

936
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,851
>> Damn.

937
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,895
>> Happy birthday!

938
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,856
>> Woo!

939
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,816
>> PROBST: Erik, come on up.

940
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,568
>> Nice job, Erik.

941
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,194
>> PROBST: A round of applause.

942
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,071
Congratulations.

943
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,030
Erik safe tonight at tribal

944
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,406
council.

945
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,157
For the rest of you, somebody is

946
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,575
going home tonight.

947
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,618
Grab your stuff.

948
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,285
Head back to camp.

949
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,787
I will see you at tribal.

950
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,639
>> Birthday boy.

951
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,474
Hey, Erik, it's your birthday.

952
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,392
One out of eight.

953
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:09,979
I keep telling you.

954
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,730
You won on your birthday.

955
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,399
>> I was telling them, what are

956
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,483
the odds, honestly?

957
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,651
>> That's awesome.

958
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,985
I'm proud of you.

959
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,487
That was a tough one too.

960
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:17,862
>> I thought so.

961
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,697
>> I'm going to get a puff ball

962
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,865
or two, maybe bring it into the

963
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,951
cave.

964
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,037
(<i> Parvati squealing</i> )

965
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,130
>> So far, part A of the plan is

966
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,257
perfect.

967
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,091
>> I looked over at Parvati, and

968
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,760
we were like, "Run, Erik!"

969
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,471
>> I was so nervous.

970
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,222
I was hyperventilating.

971
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,056
I was like...

972
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,725
>> When Erik made it, I jumped

973
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,561
up like... I didn't scream,

974
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,437
though.

975
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,062
>> So the fact that it came down

976
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,690
to Erik and James in the end,

977
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,816
and we needed Erik to win in

978
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,276
order for the plan to work out,

979
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,861
and then Erik did win, I was

980
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,696
ecstatic.

981
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,655
I think all the girls were

982
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:01,698
jumping up and down and

983
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,699
screaming silently inside their

984
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,741
heads.

985
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,702
>> The plan is in play.

986
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,245
>> The plan is in play.

(<i> laughter</i> )

988
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,293
It's like the black widow

989
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:13,793
brigade.

990
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,337
Like, all the girls are coming

991
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,131
together, and we're spinning the

992
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,591
guys around as much as we can,

993
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,467
just spinning them and spinning

994
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,301
them, until they don't know

995
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,719
which way is up, and then we're

996
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,430
devouring them one at a time.

997
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:34,647
>> Are you going to go look

998
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,273
for... what are you going to go

999
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,691
do?

1000
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:37,609
>> Yeah, I'm going to go look

1001
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,193
for crab too, in a little bit.

1002
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,487
>> It's raining.

1003
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,281
They're not out when it rains.

1004
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,616
>> And bring back some salt

1005
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,825
water.

1006
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,993
>> You want to take that bucket?

1007
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,995
Or you're going to take the pot.

1008
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:49,954
>> Yeah.

1009
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,206
>> Okay.

1010
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,083
>> I'll look in the nets too.

1011
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,220
>> He didn't go anywhere but

1012
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,764
right here, right?

1013
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,223
>> He went down there.

1014
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,641
>> I mean, he came straight up

1015
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,017
here.

1016
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,185
Where is his stuff at?

1017
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,728
I don't know.

1018
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:14,729
Where's the bag?

1019
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:15,355
Oh, the bag is over there too.

1020
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:19,859
Hurry up, Nat.

1021
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,112
>> It's in here.

1022
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,031
>> Oh, my God.

1023
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,826
>> It's in here.

1024
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,620
>> Grab it.

1025
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,996
>> It's it.

1026
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,083
>> That's the stuff.

1027
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:43,424
>> I knew he had it.

1028
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,634
Because he was like, "I know you

1029
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,136
sent me for strategy purposes."

1030
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,012
>> He won't play it tonight.

1031
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,890
He won't play it tonight.

1032
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,809
>> I told him I would go into

1033
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,852
everything a little bit later.

1034
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,853
But I'm like, "This is done."

1035
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,229
He's like, "Oh."

1036
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,689
He's like, "You sent me for a

1037
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,356
reason, huh?"

1038
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,442
I was like, "Yeah."

1039
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,113
I was able to have a

1040
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,699
conversation with Jason at the

1041
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:11,411
challenge, literally 30 seconds,

1042
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,246
hopefully got my point across in

1043
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,998
one swift motion.

1044
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,916
So I think we're good.

1045
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,084
It would be perfect, it would be

1046
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,003
brilliant for Jason to go out

1047
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,464
just like Ozzy-- blindsided, no

1048
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,174
idea that it's... what's hitting

1049
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,301
him in the face.

1050
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,386
I'd love it.

1051
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,271
>> And, yeah, we can use it

1052
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,064
however... because I wanted to

1053
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,983
say to you personally, I didn't

1054
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,401
get a chance to yesterday, you

1055
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,152
know, but thank you for keeping

1056
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,195
your word, and it means a lot to

1057
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,113
me, and you have mine in this

1058
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,948
game from now on, so...

1059
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,826
>> Cool, cool, thank you.

1060
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,536
So yeah.

1061
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,079
>> Yeah.

1062
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,416
>> Uh, the thing is... here's

1063
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,125
the thing.

1064
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,837
James is going home tonight.

1065
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,504
>> Is that what you're thinking?

1066
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:03,963
>> Uh-huh.

1067
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,757
>> That'd be great.

1068
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,926
And yeah, to let you know, I did

1069
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,094
find it.

1070
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,846
And... yeah, like that.

1071
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:12,430
(<i> snaps fingers</i> )

1072
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,265
>> Yeah.

1073
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,433
Did you see me ask Jeff.

1074
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,059
I was like, "So is the immunity

1075
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,143
idol back out?"

1076
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,061
>> Uh-huh.

1077
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,020
>> And he was like, "Oh, by the

1078
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,522
way, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da."

1079
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,482
And you were like this, and I'm

1080
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,858
like, "And... Jason."

1081
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:24,233
>> I know, I know.

1082
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,486
But it was smart.

1083
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,528
It was very smart of you to send

1084
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,447
me.

1085
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,740
I'm hoping that Natalie is

1086
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,366
telling the truth, that we're

1087
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,951
voting for James tonight.

1088
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,079
She kept her word to me at last

1089
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,789
tribal council, when we voted

1090
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,707
out Ozzy, and you know, I'm

1091
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,958
going to have to trust her this

1092
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,543
tribal council as well.

1093
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,920
After what you guys did for me

1094
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,674
last time, my word is as good as

1095
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,926
your word, which, you know, so

1096
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,219
far in this game, has been good,

1097
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,138
so...

1098
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,973
>> You know, I think I'm pretty

1099
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,058
evil.

1100
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,686
I think I could be pretty evil.

1101
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,311
What I am now is I'm definitely

1102
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,939
in "I will get you" mode.

1103
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:03,898
I'm in game mode.

1104
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:04,482
And now I'm actually having a

1105
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,609
lot more fun.

1106
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,777
I'm getting to be more of

1107
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,156
myself, which is proving to be

1108
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,909
pretty ruthless and pretty

1109
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,911
stone-cold bitch and pretty

1110
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,621
cutthroat.

1111
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,291
And I have a smile on my face.

1112
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,086
Sorry about that.

1113
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,136
>> I have, like, searched every

1114
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,388
avenue.

1115
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,098
I'm telling you, I don't know

1116
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,768
what to do.

1117
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,270
I honestly have no idea.

1118
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,857
You know what?

1119
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,281
If it's not him, I mean, they're

1120
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,825
writing your name down.

1121
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,285
>> Who is?

1122
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:01,956
>> You are?

1123
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,749
>> Yeah.

1124
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,750
Because I'm saying maybe you

1125
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,168
could too, but... you think?

1126
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,228
>> That'd be awesome.

1127
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,313
>> Yeah.

1128
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,150
I wouldn't mind.

1129
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,659
>> I get really, unbelievably

1130
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,578
fourth grade uncomfortable when,

1131
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,497
like, any guy even remotely

1132
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,456
makes a move.

1133
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,373
Like, I'm not the cool girl at

1134
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,625
all.

1135
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,167
>> Really?

1136
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:46,542
>> Really, really.

1137
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,251
>> See, I'm like a man eater

1138
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,836
now.

1139
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,587
I'm like, "You..."

1140
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,088
>> Man eater!

1141
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:56,219
(<i> laughter</i> )

1142
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,304
>> I'd love to blindside Jason,

1143
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,639
because it would be 2-0, the

1144
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,808
ladies, just at the jugular,

1145
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,059
flossing my teeth with his

1146
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,394
jugular.

1147
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,067
Either way, it's a win-win.

1148
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,610
Either Jason goes home, or Jason

1149
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,237
stays and unearths the idol, or

1150
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,114
it's James going home.

1151
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,198
Either way, it's still the five

1152
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,285
girls down to two guys.

1153
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,248
Picking them off...

1154
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,125
one by one.

1155
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,060
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1156
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,729
the members of the jury.

1157
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,494
So last tribal council, you not

1158
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,871
only vote out one of the

1159
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,289
strongest physical threats in

1160
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,374
this game, but you vote out one

1161
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,417
of the biggest providers.

1162
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,502
Parvati, does this group feel

1163
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,712
like we don't really need

1164
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,213
providers anymore?

1165
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,799
>> I think we've all felt kind

1166
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,009
of okay on our own as far as

1167
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,593
providing for ourselves for a

1168
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,511
while.

1169
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,554
Like, every person is kind of

1170
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,222
providing.

1171
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,348
>> PROBST: James, seeing that

1172
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,224
they don't need providers

1173
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,518
anymore, another big physical

1174
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,812
threat in this game is you.

1175
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,897
>> Yeah, it don't look that good

1176
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,815
for James right now.

1177
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,108
The social butterflies have done

1178
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,359
their work, and yeah, I'm

1179
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,153
definitely on the chopping

1180
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,321
block.

1181
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,822
>> PROBST: How frustrating would

1182
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,448
it be to be voted out tonight,

1183
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,449
James, after everything you've

1184
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,035
done in terms of keeping this

1185
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,578
tribe afloat?

1186
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,621
>> It was all about trying not

1187
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,538
to make certain people eat that

1188
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,414
apple.

1189
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,540
You know, and if somebody want

1190
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,249
to be greedy-- Parvati, she want

1191
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,376
to make herself in a better

1192
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,753
position, so she did what she

1193
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,629
had to do.

1194
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,132
She got rid of Ozzy.

1195
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:58,716
And now I'm pretty much next,

1196
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,425
you know, and it's very

1197
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,802
frustrating.

1198
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,638
I mean, I could try to politic,

1199
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,181
but I really suck at that.

1200
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,516
So, I mean, what can you do?

1201
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,726
>> PROBST: Erik, looking at

1202
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,019
physical threats, obviously,

1203
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,561
you're a physical threat.

1204
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,313
It's got to feel great to have

1205
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,397
immunity.

1206
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,523
>> I couldn't agree more with

1207
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,316
that.

1208
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,984
I mean, I felt like I was in the

1209
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,152
same position as James: if I

1210
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:18,694
didn't win, then I was going

1211
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,154
home.

1212
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:21,197
And if everybody feels like they

1213
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,781
can provide for themselves,

1214
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,240
that's one more reason why you

1215
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,576
don't need Erik around.

1216
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,078
>> PROBST: The other significant

1217
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,412
thing about the last vote is

1218
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,373
that you're still here, Jason.

1219
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,209
Has your social standing in this

1220
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,670
game truly changed as a result

1221
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,213
of stepping down off that

1222
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,339
immunity challenge?

1223
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,257
>> Yeah.

1224
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,257
Every little difference I make

1225
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,384
around camp is changing my

1226
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,386
social standing in this game.

1227
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,388
But I was sent away to Exile,

1228
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,224
where I was gone for two days.

1229
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,558
So you know, it's difficult to

1230
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,018
say where I stand in the tribe

1231
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,228
right now.

1232
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:52,853
>> PROBST: You say you're not

1233
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,271
sure because you were sent to

1234
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,690
Exile Island.

1235
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,191
Two sides to that coin.

1236
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,234
It could be a sentence to go

1237
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,193
there.

1238
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,362
It could be an opportunity.

1239
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,072
>> It was an opportunity for me

1240
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,573
to look for the idol, but at

1241
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,533
this point in the game, I wanted

1242
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,411
to stay with my tribe mates and

1243
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,912
really, you know, show them that

1244
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,455
I can make these differences.

1245
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,873
So you know, I'll have to see

1246
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,625
how it plays out.

1247
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,584
>> PROBST: Natalie, is it

1248
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,460
possible to change your standing

1249
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,462
in the game that quickly?

1250
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,338
>> Absolutely.

1251
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,215
It's constantly changing,

1252
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,926
constantly.

1253
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,635
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1254
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:24,927
to the vote.

1255
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:25,511
Erik, you have the immunity

1256
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,430
necklace, unless you want to do

1257
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,514
something crazy and give it to

1258
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,932
somebody else.

1259
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:30,641
>> I'm not crazy.

1260
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,684
I think I'm going to keep it.

1261
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,476
>> PROBST: Erik is safe tonight.

1262
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,394
You cannot vote for Erik.

1263
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,146
Everybody else is fair game.

1264
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:35,730
It's time to vote.

1265
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,524
Amanda you're up.

1266
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,701
>> James, you played a good

1267
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,744
game.

1268
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,037
Unfortunately, Parvati got you

1269
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,539
in the end.

1270
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,131
>> You couldn't just frolic

1271
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:02,715
naked and enjoy the heavens.

1272
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,634
You had to eat the damn apple.

1273
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,079
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1274
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,165
votes.

1275
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,094
If anybody has the hidden

1276
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,303
immunity idol, and you want to

1277
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:50,513
play it, now would be the time

1278
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,390
to do so.

1279
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,317
Okay, once the votes are read,

1280
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,402
the decision is final.

1281
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:04,985
The person voted out will be

1282
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,362
asked to leave the tribal

1283
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:06,904
council area immediately.

1284
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,032
I'll read the votes.

1285
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,703
First vote, James.

1286
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,415
Jason.

1287
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,501
One vote James, one vote Jason.

1288
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:23,838
James.

1289
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,465
Two votes James, one vote Jason.

1290
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,594
Parvati.

1291
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,847
Two votes James, one vote Jason,

1292
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,557
one vote Parvati.

1293
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:37,935
James.

1294
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,395
That's three votes James, one

1295
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,605
vote Jason, one vote Parvati.

1296
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,985
Jason.

1297
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:46,569
That's two votes Jason, three

1298
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,322
votes James, one vote Parvati.

1299
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,534
Jason.

1300
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,077
That's three votes Jason, three

1301
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,205
votes James, one vote Parvati.

1302
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,541
One vote left.

1303
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,629
11th person voted out of

1304
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,423
<i>Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites</i>

1305
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,299
and the third member of our

1306
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,176
jury, Jason.

1307
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:10,759
That's four.

1308
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,385
That's enough.

1309
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,846
You need to bring me your torch.

1310
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,069
Jason, the tribe has spoken.

1311
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,573
It's time for you to go.

1312
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,667
Well, after back-to-back

1313
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,669
blindsides, anybody who still

1314
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,256
feels safe is a fool.

1315
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,799
James, on your way out, I want

1316
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,134
medical to look at your finger.

1317
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,427
Everybody else, grab your

1318
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,761
torches.

1319
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,429
Head back to camp.

<i>Survivor...</i>

1331
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:18,869
>> I work with my hands, so it's

1332
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,538
very important I get this thing

1333
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,622
fixed as soon as possible.

1334
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,374
>> PROBST: A new idol has been

1335
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:23,666
hidden.

1336
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,626
The first clue awaits you at

1337
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,128
Exile Island.

1338
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,301
>> That's Jeff Probst!

1339
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,345
He's just standing there!

1340
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,059
>> I was definitely played today

1341
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,477
by Natalie and the rest of the

1342
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:43,686
girls.

1343
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,063
They did the same thing in

1344
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,398
voting out Ozzy.

1345
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,565
I should have been a little more

1346
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,149
wary of what they were telling

1347
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,402
me.

1348
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,486
What they did tonight will

1349
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:53,070
definitely come back to haunt

1350
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,738
them as I'm sitting up there on

1351
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,739
the jury.

1352
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,740
I just wish I would have been a

1353
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,741
little smarter and played the

1354
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,742
hidden immunity idol when I had

1355
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,828
the chance.
