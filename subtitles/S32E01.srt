1
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,268
>> Jeff: THESE 18 STRANGERS
HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO BE MAROONED

2
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:24,774
AND LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES
FOR THE NEXT 39 DAYS.

3
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,652
THEY'RE CRUISING THROUGH THE
WATERS OF KAOH RONG IN SOUTHEAST

4
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:33,658
ASIA, A BEAUTIFUL BUT FORMID
IBLG PART OF THE WORLD.

5
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,078
SCORCHING TEMPERATURES AND
STIFLING HUMIDITY PUNISH THE

6
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,288
BODY.

7
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,125
DEHYDRATION AND HEATSTROKE CAN
BRING DOWN EVEN THE STRONGEST.

8
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,296
THE SMALLEST CUT CAN LEAD TO A
LIFE-THREATENING INFECTION.

9
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,884
AND IF THEY LAST LONG ENOUGH,
MERELY EXERTING ENERGY WILL

10
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,595
BECOME THEIR BIGGEST OBSTACLE.

11
00:00:53,678 --> 00:01:04,147
THIS WILL BE THE MOST GRUELING
39 DAYS IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,692
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN DIVIDED
INTO THREE TRIBES BASED ON THE

13
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,821
QUALITIES THEY MOST RELY ON IN
THEIR DAILY LIVES.

14
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,199
THE BRAIN TRIBE:
>> BEING AN E.R. DOCTOR, IT'S

15
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:19,662
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO
NOT SHOW HOW SMART I AM, TO

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,206
EXPRESS HUMILITY, BUT I CAN'T
DEAL WITH IGNORANT PEOPLE

17
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,042
BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:28,546
>> THIS GAME IS LARGELY A BRAIN
GAME, AND IN THESE CHALLENGES, I

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,176
AM GOING TO KICK ASS, BECAUSE
PUZZLES LAY DOWN FOR ME LIKE

20
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,679
LOVERS.

21
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,183
>> Jeff: THE BRAWN TRIBE:
>> I AM A FORMER PROFESSIONAL

22
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,434
BASKETBALL PLAYER.

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,812
I WAS THE GUY THAT DID ALL THE
THINGS NOBODY ELSE WANTED TO DO.

24
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,563
I'D GO KNOCK PEOPLE ON THE
GROUND.

25
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,231
I'D PUSH PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY.

26
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,691
DIIT BETTER THAN MOST GUYS.

27
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,153
PEOPLE I'M GOING TO GET ALONG
WITH ARE GUYS THAT ARE STRONG

28
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:58,743
AND YOU SHOW A WEAKNESS,
BYE-BYE.

29
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,038
>> MY BREAD AND BUTTER HAS
ALWAYS BEEN BOUNTY HUNTING.

30
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,375
YOU KICK IN THE DOOR, YOU RAID
THE HOUSE, YOU SNATCH THE GUY

31
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,919
UP, HOG TIE HIM LIKE A PIG,
THROW HIM IN THE BACK OF YOUR

32
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,878
TRUCK AND TAKE OFF.

33
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,046
I DON'T CARE.

34
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,340
I JUST NEED TO GET MY PAYCHECK,
AND YOU'RE MY PAYCHICK.

35
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,886
>> Jeff: THE BEAUTY TRIBE:
>> I DO TRY AND USE MY LOOKS TO

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,054
MY ADVANTAGE IN POKER.

37
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:22,350
AND IF I FEEL LIKE A MALE IS
STARING AT MY BOOBS, I MIGHT

38
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,894
PUSH THEM UP A LITTLE MORE.

39
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,939
>> MY LIFE HAS DEFINITELY BEEN
EASIER BECAUSE I'M BETTER

40
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,233
LOOKING THAN MOST PEOPLE.

41
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,151
AND THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

42
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:32,735
IT SOUNDS AWFUL.

43
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,736
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,574
MY LOOKS WILL DEFINITELY HELP
ME.

45
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:44,080
39 DAYS AND A MILLION BUCKS IN
MY POCKET AT THE END.

46
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,749
>> YEAH, BABY!

47
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,292
WOOO!

48
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,293
>> GET THE FISH TRAP.

49
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,460
GET THE FISH TRAP.

50
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,255
>> Jeff: YOU ARE WITNESSING 18
AMERICANS BEGIN AN ADVENTURE

51
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,759
THAT WILL FOREVER CHANGE THEIR
LIVES.

52
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,096
THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN TWO MINUTES
TO SALVAGE WHATEVER THEY CAN OFF

53
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:00,513
THIS BOAT.

54
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,556
>> WATCH OUT!

55
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,602
COMING DOWN!

56
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,436
>> Jeff: THERE ARE CHICKENS.

57
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,104
THERE IS FRUIT.

58
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,773
THERE ARE FISH TRAPS.

59
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,319
BUT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO
AROUND.

60
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,069
>> OH!

61
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:23,411
>> Jeff: YOU GOT A LOOSE
CHICKEN.

62
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,415
>> PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY
RECOGNIZE ME FROM "BIG BROTHER,"

63
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,460
BUT BEING AN OUTDOORSMAN, THIS
GAME IS TOTALLY FOR ME.

64
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,296
I DON'T MIND GETTING DIRTY AT
ALL.

65
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,925
>> Jeff: YOU NEED TO WORK
TOGETHER!

66
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,135
>> WATCH OUT.

67
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,055
>> YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

68
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:42,472
>> OH!

69
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,348
OUCH!

70
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,600
>> Jeff: YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYBODY'S NAME.

71
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,310
YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU LIKE THEM!

72
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,146
AND YET YOU'RE ALREADY RELYING
ON THEM.

73
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,688
>> THROW STUFF OVER.

74
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,023
COME ON.

75
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,483
IT'S VERY HECTIC DOWN HERE.

76
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:58,112
I'M A RETIRED F.B.I. AGENTS AND,
OF COURSE, THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES

77
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,491
IN THE F.B.I. WHEN WE HAD THOSE
KINDS OF CASE WHERE'S

78
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,617
EVERYTHING'S GONE A MILE A
MINUTE.

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,286
BUT THIS TO ME IS GOING TO BE
THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE.

80
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,704
SO I'M PUMPED FOR THIS.

81
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,123
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL FOR ME.

THEY MUST LEARN TO ADAPT OR
THEY'LL BE VOTED OUT.

106

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,948
>> IN CALIFORNIA ORIGINALLY, I
LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY NOW.

174
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,909
I WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT DOING
DATA ANALYSIS.

175
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,579
>> WELL, WHAT'S YOUR REGRESSION
ANALYSIS OF "SURVIVOR" RIGHT

176
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,413
NOW?

177
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,415
>> I HAVEN'T DONE SOMETHING LIKE
THAT.

178
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,042
I THINK I WOULD NEED A LOT MORE
TIME.

179
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,752
THE BRAIN TRIBE IS DEFINITELY MY
TRIBE.

180
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,630
THAT'S THE ATTRIBUTE THAT I
ACTUALLY THINK IS VALUABLE

181
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,799
BECAUSE WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK FOR
NEW APPROACHES AND SLIGHTLY

182
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,594
DIFFERENT WAYS OF THINKING
THROUGH THE PROBLEMS.

183
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,387
SO WE'RE OFF TO AN IMMEDIATE
ADVANTAGE.

184
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,432
>> OKAY, I GET TO SAY IT-- I'M
STARING AT THIS GUY.

185
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:40,061
I'M THINKING, WHAT IS THE
PRESIDENT DOING HERE?

186
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,771
>> BEING CALLED OBAMA IS PART OF
MY DAILY LIFE.

187
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,608
IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT FOR THE LAST
SEVEN YEARS.

188
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,987
IF DEBBIE CALLS ME OBAMA, I
GUARANTEE YOU, EVERYONE ELSE IS

189
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,113
CALLING ME OBAMA.

190
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,575
>> WHEN YOU'RE COMING IT'S GOING
TO BE LIKE IN MY HEAD.

191
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,077
>> WE'LL PROTECT YOU, BARRY.

192
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,122
>> THAT BEING SAID, IF THEY FEEL
BETTER GETTING CRUSHED BY OBAMA,

193
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,165
SO BE IT.

194
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,503
>> I'M A CAPTAIN, CIVIL AIR
PATROL, U.S. AIR FORCE

195
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,337
AUXILIARY.

196
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,421
I CAN GET A FIRE STARTED WITHOUT
FLINT.

197
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,384
I HAVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING IN
SHELTER BUILDING, WINTER

198
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:16,764
SURVIVAL, SUMMER SURVIVAL,
REPELLING.

199
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:21,811
I'M A CHEMIST BUT I HAVE BEEN A
PROTONICS ENGINEERING

200
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,062
SUPERVISOR.

201
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:27,817
A BARTENDER, CARETAKE TORE NONE,
AND BETWEEN JOBS I FILL IN AT

202
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,652
RED LOBSTER AS A STERVER.

203
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,782
DO YOU GUYS WANT TO DO A QUICK
ASSESSMENT AND UNLOAD.

204
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:43,833
AT 49 I BRING A LOT OF WORLDLY
EXPERIENCE WITH ME.

205
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,336
>> I'LL ACTUALLY SHOW YOU A
TRICK RIGHT NOW.

206
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,630
YOU ACTUALLY WANT FRICTION.

207
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,506
>> YUP.

208
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,466
>> AND WE'LL SHAVE THIS OFF A
LITTLE BIT.

209
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,885
>> I HAVE MY OWN ICE CREAM
BUSINESS, AND I THINK PEOPLE

210
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,847
THINK THAT I'M A DANDY IN ICE
CREAM HAT.

211
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,851
I THINK THEY DON'T KNOW QUITE
WHAT TO MAKE OF ME.

212
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,687
I'M INCORRIGIBLE AND ECCENTRIC.

213
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,857
BUT DEBBIE HAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT
LEVEL OF CRAZINESS.

214
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,983
>> LOOK, HE'S GOT IT.

215
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,234
>> TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

216
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,529
>> ONCE IT'S REALLY SMOKING, YOU
PICK IT UP, AND YOU'RE GOING TO

217
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:14,196
BLOW IN THE LITTLE HOLE.

218
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,531
>> I DON'T HAVE A HOLE YET.

219
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,366
>> OKAY, THEM KEEP DOING IT.

220
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,200
>> KEEP GOING.

221
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,201
YOU'VE GOT SMOKE GOING.

222
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,870
>> SHOULD WE PUT A LITTLE HOLE
IN IT.

223
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,165
>> NO THE HOLE IS GOING TO COME
FROM YOU AND FRICTION.

224
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,708
>> YOU DID THE HOLE?

225
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,292
>> YES.

226
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,502
>> THERE'S NO HOLE YET.

227
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,587
THERE'S JUST A NOTCH.

228
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,256
>> I KNOW HOW EXHAUSTING T, SO
IF YOU WANT ME TO DO IT.

229
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,843
>> SUPPOSEDLY, DEBBIE HAS
STARTED FIRE THIS WAY MANY

230
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,053
TIMES.

231
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,722
NOBODY ELSE MADE ANY WARRANTS
ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO BE THE

232
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,973
SAVIOR OF THIS TRIBE.

233
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,768
SOMEBODY WHO SAYS SHE'S A FIRE
EXPERT AND THEN COMES ON TO THE

234
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,687
BEACH AND WHEN IT'S REALLY
CLUTCH TIME AND NEEDS TO MAKE

235
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,940
FIRE FOR THEIR TRIBE CAN'T DO
IT, IS A BIG CONCERN.

236
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,569
>> WE CANNOT SHOW UP IN FRONT OF
THE OTHER TRIBES AS THE BRAINS

237
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:54,403
WITHOUT FIRE.

238
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,072
JUST FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY
STANDPOINT.

239
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,492
>> NO ONE HAS CONCEDED DEFEAT,
SIR.

240
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,912
>> LOOKING BACK AT PAST SEASONS,
IT SEEMS LIKE THE REALLY SMART

241
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,956
FOLKS ALWAYS HAVE SOME FORM OF
KRYPTONITE, SO I'M A LITTLE

242
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,918
CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ON THE
BRAIN TRIBE.

243
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:23,599
IT MIGHT BE COMPLETE AND UTTER
MADNESS.

244
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,393
>> GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS!

245
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,395
>> WHO-HOO.

246
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,271
>> LIFE WITHOUT A DOUBT IS
BEAUTIFUL.

247
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,856
OUR TRIBE IS BEAUTIFUL.

248
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,400
WE'RE FEELING BEAUTIFUL.

249
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,609
THE ISLAND IS BEAUTIFUL.

250
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,945
I MEAN, WE'RE ALL EXCITED, WE'RE
ALL HAPPY, WE'RE ALL SMILES.

251
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,406
AND WE WORK WELL TOGETHER.

252
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,324
AROUND CAMP, RIGHT NOW, NOTHING
CAN GO WRONG.

253
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,911
>> OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE GOING TO
GIVE ME A FREAKING HEART ATTACK

254
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,578
DOING THAT.

255
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,123
>> OH, THERE'S COCONUTS, TOO.

256
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,290
WHY AM I HERE?

257
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:54,922
LOOK AT ME, I'M BALD, BIG HAT,
BALD, BIG EERKZ SKINNY LITTLE

258
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,423
BODY.

259
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,465
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

260
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,802
I JUST THINK, MY GOD, WHEN I GO
HOME, PEOPLE SAY HA!

261
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,097
THEY SAY WHY ARE THEY PUTTING
YOU ON THE BEAUTY TRIBE,

262
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,974
ESPECIALLY MY BOYFRIEND OR
SOMEBODY.

263
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,977
BUT I THINK MY PERSONALITY CAN
COME OUT.

264
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,020
WE ALL HAVE BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND
OUTSIDE.

265
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,814
>> THAT LOOKS GOOD!

266
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,357
>> IT DOES LOOK GOOD.

267
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:20,197
>> IT REALLY DOES LOOK GOOD.

268
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,031
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

269
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,785
DEFINITELY, LIKE, A MODEL OR--
>> YEAH.

270
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,995
>> HE SHAVES HIS ARMS AND LEGS.

271
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:26,996
I NOTICED THAT.

272
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,832
>> BEING A BARTENDER IS AN
EXTREMELY SOCIAL JOB.

273
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:34,795
YOU LEARN THAT PERSONALITY TYPES
WANT CERTAIN THINGS FROM YOU, SO

274
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,174
I WAS LIKE, OKAY, WHO LOOKS LIKE
I WOULD GET ALONG WITH THEM?

275
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,301
THERE'S T TAI.

276
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:40,968
HE'S FREAKING ALWAYS MOVING.

277
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,887
HE'S LIKE A WHIRLWIND.

278
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,054
CALEB IS SUPER STRONG.

279
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,891
AND NICK, THE TALL, DREAMY GUY,
OF COURSE, I WAS LIKE OH!

280
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,058
HE'S ON MY TRIBE.

281
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:53,022
I GET TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME
WITH HIM AND HE GET TO SEE ME

282
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:53,355
DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY.

283
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,106
WONDERFUL.

284
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,152
>> THIS IS SO, LIKE,
STEREOTYPAL.

285
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,030
>> I'M NOT SURE I CAN HANDLE ALL
THAT TESTOSTERONE OVER THERE

286
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,114
ANYWAY.

287
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,700
SO I DECIDED TO BUILD THE
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GIRLS.

288
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:08,996
YOU'RE INCLINED TO GO WITH THE
GIRLS, BRAID EACH OTHER'S HAIR,

289
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,122
WHATEVER.

290
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,959
GIRLS KIND OF GO WITH GIRLS SO
THAT ALLIANCE FELT REALLY

291
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,169
NATURAL TO ME.

292
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,046
>> DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO
PAIR UP, THE THREE OF THEM?

293
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,049
>> PART OF ME THINKS THEY WON'T
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT.

294
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:24,345
>> I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A
LOT OF EGO OVER THERE.

295
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,096
>> YEAH.

296
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,141
>> ONE OF THE GIRLS SHE SAID SHE
WAS IN SCHOOL TO BE A BIOLOGIST.

297
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:29,892
>> WHICH ONE IS THAT?

298
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,061
>> THE ONE CLOSEST TO US?

299
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:32,561
>> MICHELE?

300
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,230
>> WHICH ONE IS THAT?

301
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,064
>> THE YELLOW.

302
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,065
>> THE ONE IN THE YELLOW?

303
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,316
>> YEAH.

304
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,194
>> I'M LOOK AROUND AT MY BEAUT
TRIBE AND I'M SITTING HERE KIND

305
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,907
OF WONDERING TO MYSELF, WHY IN
THE WORLD IS TAI ON THIS TRIBE.

306
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,913
50, 60-YEAR-OLD ASIAN GUY THAT
HAS EYEBROWS, LIKE, TWO OR THREE

307
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,413
INCHES LONG.

308
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,581
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

309
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,251
LIKE, MAYBE THERE'S A LOT MORE
THAN WHAT PEOPLE REALLY SEE.

310
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,044
>> SO WE'RE GOING TO DO-- YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE A NOTCH.

311
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,128
>> YEAH, MAKE A NOTCH.

312
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,964
>> THIS WAY.

313
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:05,386
>> HOW HIGH, DO YOU THINK ABOUT
RIGHT HERE?

314
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:10,224
>> YEAH, SURE.

315
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,225
>> DON'T KILL THE TREE?

316
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,351
>> DON'T KILL IT.

317
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,230
>> I HAVE A SOFT SPOT FOR TREES
BECAUSE I'M A GARDENER.

318
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,439
>> ARE YOU?

319
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,150
I HATE TO TELL YOU, BUT I'M
MURDALIZING THIS TREE RIGHT NOW.

320
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,986
>> IT'S A LIVING BEING.

321
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:26,073
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE
CAME OVER AND STARTING CUTTING

322
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,324
AWAY PART OF YOUR SKIN?

323
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,119
>> THE GOOD THING IS IT DOESN'T
HAVE ARMS AND CAN'T HIT ME BACK.

324
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:34,582
>> I LOVE ALL LIVING CREATURES,
ESPECIALLY THE PLANT.

325
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,836
AS A GARDNER, IT HURTS ME WHEN I
SEE PEOPLE CUT OFF BRANCHES.

326
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,837
IT'S JUST LIKE AN ARM.

327
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,673
YOU CUT IT OFF, IT CANNOT GROW
BACK THE SAME WAY.

328
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,134
AND SOMETIMES I COULD BE REALLY
STRONG ABOUT IT.

329
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,510
BUT THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

330
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,138
I'VE GOT TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW I
SAY IT.

331
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,139
>> YOU'RE A GARDENER, TAI?

332
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,308
>> YEAH.

333
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,309
>> UP IN SAN FRANCISCO?

334
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,935
>> YEAH.

335
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,312
>> AND I'M FROM VIETNAM.

336
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,732
THIS IS, LIKE, MY HOOD, SO I
KNOW A LOT OF STUFF.

337
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,817
>> HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN IN SAN
FRANCISCO?

338
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,195
>> I HAVE TO GO GET IN THE YOUNG
EXPEL GET FOOD FOR US.

339
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,071
I'M FROM VIETNAM.

340
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,325
I LIVED THROUGH THE WAR AND I
SURVIVED.

341
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,162
AND IN 1979, 262 PEOPLE WERE ON
A 26-METER BOAT.

342
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,166
WE'RE JUST SITTING THERE LIKE
THIS FOR, LIKE, FOR 11 DAYS.

343
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,209
WE HAVE NO FOOD.

344
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:19,835
NO FOOD.

345
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:20,669
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WATER.

346
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,672
AND WE JUST FLOAT AND FLOAT AND
FLOAT.

347
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,092
AND WE END UP ON THIS REFUGEE
CAMP REALLY CLOSE TO HERE.

348
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,804
A WHOLE YEAR, AND THEN WE COME
TO AMERICA.

349
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,140
SO THROUGHOUT A LOT OF MY LIFE,
THAT'S A LOT OF THINGS I

350
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,185
SURVIVED THROUGH AND I THINK I
HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.

351
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:36,685
ADVENTURE JUST EXCITES ME.

352
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,687
I CAN'T SIT STILL.

353
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,355
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

354
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,523
THIS IS ONCE IN A LIFETIME.

355
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,441
I'M LOVING IT.

356
00:15:54,912 --> 00:16:02,670
>> OH!

357
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,394
>> IT'S A HARSH SUN.

358
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,269
MY SHOULDERS ARE FRIED.

359
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,731
MY SHINS ARE FRIED.

360
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,860
SUNBURN HURTS, YOU KNOW, BUT I
GIVE IT MY ALL, WORK PHYSICALLY

361
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,238
HARD FIRST AND START THINKING
ABOUT IT AS YOU'RE GOING ALONG.

362
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:34,743
IT'S JUST THE TYPE OF PERSON I
AM.

363
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,372
>> I GOT IT.

364
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,290
>> WE NEED ONE OF THE GUYS TO DO
THIS.

365
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,375
>> THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL.

366
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:48,048
>> BLONDIE, I HAVEN'T EVEN
LEARNED HER NAME, CALL HER

367
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:48,757
BLONDIE.

368
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,928
I HAVE ZERO FAITH IN THAT GIRL.

369
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,264
>> I REMEMBER THE DIRECTIONS,
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

370
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,266
>> SHE DOESN'T DOING WITH.

371
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,268
>> WE NEED MORE BAMBOO DON'T WE.

372
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,437
>> I THINK THERE'S MORE OVER
THERE.

373
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,104
>> I'LL GO.

374
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,439
>> YOU WANT TO HEAD OUT THERE?

375
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,148
>> TO ME, SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM.

376
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,734
I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR HER.

377
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:12,740
I GOT MY OWN WIFE AND KIDS TO
WORRY ABOUT.

378
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,283
BLONDIE, LITTLE GIRL REAL ESTATE
AGENT?

379
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,286
>> WE'VE GOT STRONG PEOPLE AND
ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'VE GOT THE

380
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,078
CALIFORNIA GIRL.

381
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,748
>> WORST COMES TO WORST, HER,
RIGHT?

382
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,915
>> YEAH.

383
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,293
THE PLAN IS YOU, JENNY, AND ME.

384
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,129
>> JENNY'S THE CONSTRUCTION
WORKER, RIGHT?

385
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,088
>> YEAH.

386
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,298
>> I'M IN WITH YOU.

387
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,299
>> ALL RIGHT.

388
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,801
>> THE TRUTH SI WANT AS MANY
ALLIANCES AS POSSIBLE.

389
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,136
>> ARE WE GOING GOOD?

390
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,345
>> YEAH.

391
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,347
>> IN MY EYES, THESE ALLIANCES
ARE ONLY TRUTHFUL WHEN I NEED

392
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:37,890
THEM.

393
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,975
>> YOU, ME, AND SCOT.

394
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,018
>> YEAH.

395
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,396
>> POTENTIALLY, THEY COULD ALL
BE TRUTHFUL IN A WAY.

396
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,357
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM COULD
BE FALSE.

397
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,193
I'LL MAKE THAT DECISION AS I
NEED TO MAKE IT.

398
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:54,323
>> YOU AIN'T GOT ANY MATCHES ON
YOU, DO YOU?

399
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:54,823
NO?

400
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,407
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

401
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,241
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

402
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,785
IF I LAYER THEM, IT WILL BE ALL
RIGHT.

403
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,038
I FEEL LIKE IT WILL BE A LITTLE
HOLY.

404
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,831
>> I GET WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW.

405
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,374
GROWING UP IN CHICAGO, IT'S
PRETTY TOUGH.

406
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,170
THERE WAS A LOT OF STUFF THEY
LEARNED, AND I'M GOING TO BRING

407
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,005
THOSE INSTINCTS INTO THIS GAME.

408
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:10,422
I'M GOING TO USE MY GUT.

409
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,217
I GOT YOUR BACK.

410
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,594
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE GOOD THEN.

411
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,012
I KIND OF LIKE ALECIA?

412
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,806
>> YOU DON'T LIKE HER.

413
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,848
WHO DO YOU WANT TO ALIGN WITH?

414
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,518
>> I'M THINKING THE GUYS, I LIKE
THEM MORE.

415
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,186
I'M THINKING WE NEED TO GET THE
GIRLS OUT FIRST.

416
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,816
>> I MOST DEFINITELY TRUST
CYDNEY.

417
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,234
THIS GUT DON'T LIE TO ME.

418
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,028
>> I MINUTE I FIND OUT SOMETHING
I'M GOING TO LET YOU KNOW.

419
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:39,701
AND RIGHT NOW, MY GUT TELLS ME
DON'T USE THE BATHROOM.

420
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,371
>> IS DARNELL GOING TO THE POOP
ROCKS?

421
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,038
>> HE IS.

422
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,999
>> I'D GO A LITTLE FURTHER.

423
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,918
>> OH!

424
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:48,669
( LAUGHTER ).

425
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,880
>> WATCH OUT FOR THE BROWN
TROUT!

426
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,468
>> I JUST HEARD, "DARNELL, ARE
YOU TAKING A DUMP?"

427
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,261
SERIOUSLY.

428
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,347
I CAN'T BE AT PEACE FOR TWO
SECONDS?

429
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:10,107
I NEED SOME READING MATERIAL.

430
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,778
>> SO, WHERE IS EVERYONE FROM?

431
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:19,741
>> I LIVE IN REDONDO BEACH,
CALIFORNIA, BUT I'M FROM NEW

432
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,284
JERSEY.

433
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:20,826
>> WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

434
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,702
>> I'M FROM KENTUCKY.

435
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,873
>> OH, MY GOD, THE CHICKENS!

436
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,458
>> I WONDER IF WE'RE BURNING
MORE CALORIES THAN WHAT WE'RE

437
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,252
GONNA GET OUT OF THIS CHICKEN.

438
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:35,549
IT WASN'T THE BEST OF STARTS FOR
THE BEAUTY TRIBE WHATSOEVER.

439
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,594
WHILE WE'RE BUILDING THE
SHELTER, THE CHICKENS GET OUT.

440
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:43,432
IT'S JUST, LIKE, REALLY, THIS,
RIGHT NOW?

441
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,768
>> YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE US A REALLY GOOD--

442
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,895
>> WAIT, WAIT!

443
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,438
>> GUYS, DO YOU SEE IT?

444
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,774
>> WE ARE RUNNING AROUND LIKE
CHICKENS WITH OUR HEADS CUT OFF,

445
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:58,780
AND WE'RE WASTING CALORIES BUT
YOU DESPERATELY WANT THOSE

446
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,114
CHICKENS.

447
00:19:59,197 --> 00:19:59,990
>> YEAH!

448
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,617
>> WE NEED TO MAKE A BETTER
CHICKEN TRAP.

449
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,412
>> WE GOT TWO OF THEM BACK, AND
66%, I'LL TAKE IT.

450
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,748
BUT IT WASN'T THE BEST START.

451
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,458
>> I HAVE AN IDEA.

452
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,086
WE'LL TIE ONE CHICKEN TO THE
NEXT CHICKEN, ALL RIGHT.

453
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,255
AND BETWEEN THEM, WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A LONG LINE.

454
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:15,797
>> OKAY.

455
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,799
>> THEY CAN ROAM AROUND.

456
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,636
THEY'LL BE HAPPIER THAT WAY.

457
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,219
YEAH.

458
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:21,970
I THINK THAT WILL BE GOOD.

459
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,473
>> I LOVE TAI'S APPROACH ON
LIFE.

460
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,185
HE TAKES HIS TIME WITH ALL OF
US, AND WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING

461
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,520
NEW, HE TRIES TO TEACH ALL OF
US.

462
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,563
AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT ABOUT
HIM.

463
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,107
>> IT'S A LITTLE PET.

464
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:34,775
>> DON'T LET GO.

465
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,984
>> I'M NOT.

466
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:40,447
HE TAUGHT US HOW TO TIE A LITTLE
ROPE ON THE CHICKEN AND HOW TO

467
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:40,864
RUN AROUND.

468
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,032
I RESPECT THAT.

469
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,995
HE RESPECTS ALL THE CREATUREES
AND CHICKENS THAT LIVE HERE.

470
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,496
IS THAT ATTACHED?

471
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,497
>> HOW CUTE IS THAT?

472
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,166
>> THEY SEEM SO MUCH HAPPIER.

473
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,542
>> THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEAD IN A
FEW DAYS.

474
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,128
>> THEY'RE TWO LITTLE LITTLE
BUDDIES.

475
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,838
>> I THINK THIS ONE MIGHT BE A
ROOSTER.

476
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,173
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING,
TOO.

477
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,884
>> TAI IS SOMEONE I CAN
DEFINITELY WORK WITH.

478
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,303
THE THREE GIRLS WE'RE PRETTY
TIGHT BUT IN ORDER TO HAVE THE

479
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,472
NUMBERS AND PROPEL OURSELVES IN
THE GAME, WE NEED A GUY, AND TAI

480
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,808
IS PERFECT TO TAKE ALONG WITH
US.

481
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,685
WE CAN USE HIM, FOR SURE.

482
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,353
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE
ASIAN GUY?

483
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,147
>> YEAH, HONESTLY, I LOVED HIM
FROM FIRST SIGHT.

484
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,065
>> YOU, TOO.

485
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,693
>> YOU ARE, LIKE AIR, SWEETHEART
ME AND YOU?

486
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,194
>> YES.

487
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,362
>> OKAY.

488
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,197
>> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A
CONNOTATION THAT COMES FROM

489
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,157
BEING IN A SORORITY.

490
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,409
PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE YOU.

491
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,576
THEY THINK THAT'S ALL YOU DO AND
THAT'S HOW YOU GET THROUGH LIFE,

492
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,577
THE WAY YOU LOOK.

493
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:32,040
BUT I'M REALLY NOT LIKE AT THAT
ALL.

494
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,710
I CAN PULL MY OWN WEIGHT AND
WILL MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH THESE

495
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,961
PEOPLE INSTANTLY.

496
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,715
I WANT TO STICK WITH ANNA AND
MICHELE, I THINK THE THREE OF US

497
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,173
COULD DO VERY WELL.

498
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,509
>> YOU, I TRUST.

499
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,555
I AM LIKE 99% SURE THAT THE
OTHER GUY WAS ON "BIG BROTHER."

500
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,389
>> WHICH ONE?

501
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,557
>> CALEB.

502
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,561
>> JULIA CAME UP TO ME AND SAID,
LISTEN, CALEB WAS ON "BIG

503
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:52,936
BROTHER."

504
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,187
I TRUST HER.

505
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,274
IT GIVES US A LOT OF INFORMATION
THAT HE WAS ON "BIG BROTHER."

506
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,735
HE WAS IN AN ALLIANCE OF NINE ON
"BIG BROTHER" AND HE KEPT IT ALL

507
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,987
THE WAY, WHICH SHOWS ME HE'S
VERY LOYAL.

508
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,697
SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR
US.

509
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,533
>> I WAS AFRAID YOU GUYS
WOULDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS.

510
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,118
NICK KNOWS.

511
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,244
>> YOU MEAN "BIG BROTHER"?

512
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,537
>> YEAH, YEAH.

513
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,456
I WOULDN'T AT THE PRESENT TIME
TO I GUESS HURT MY GAME.

514
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,751
>> WE'RE NOT JUST THE BEAUTY
TRIBE.

515
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,002
WE HAVE BRAINS, TOO.

516
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,421
>> I'M BEAST MODE COWBOY FROM
"BIG BROTHER," BUT I'M MORE THAN

517
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,716
THAT AND I WANT TO SHOW
EVERYBODY WHAT I'M MADE OF.

518
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,759
>> YOU GOT IT!

519
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,760
>> ALMOST.

520
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,594
>> YOU DEFINITELY BELONG ON THE
BEAUTY TRIBE.

521
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,722
YOU LOOK GREAT UP IN THAT TREE.

522
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,265
>> I WAS IN THE MILITARY RIGHT
OUT OF HOLLY.

523
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:38,899
I WAS A PRISON GUARD IN BAGDAD,
IRAQ.

524
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,277
IF I'M IN A COMPETITION STANDING
ON MY TIPPY TOES FOR THREE

525
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,947
HOURS, I'M GOING TO STAND ON MY
TIPPY TOES FOR THREE HOURS UNTIL

526
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,782
LAST PERSON GIVES UP.

527
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,492
>> CALEB!

528
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,659
>> BLOW, BLOW, BLOW, BLOW.

529
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:54,998
>> LIVING MY DAIFL LIFE ON A
FARM AND BEING AN OUTDOORSMAN,

530
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:55,832
THIS IS HOME TO ME.

531
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,168
I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A
FIRE.

532
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:58,627
>> HERE WE GO, BABY.

533
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,712
>> WE'VE GOT FIRE!

534
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,589
>> I'LL DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO
TO GET WHAT I WANT.

535
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:07,469
I BELIEVE I'M PROBABLY MEBT
MENTALLY STRONGER THAN ANYBODY

536
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,512
IN THIS GAME.

537
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:18,480
>> FIRE!

538
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,982
>> GETS EXCITING WHEN YOU GET TO
THE END.

539
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,983
>> YEAH!

540
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:22,567
COOL.

541
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,819
THAT WAS A GOOD RHYTHM.

542
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,656
>> I'M 71 YEARS OLD, AND I WAS A
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR IN THE F.B.I.

543
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:32,619
WE WERE ON SOME DANGEROUS
ASSIGNMENTS AT TIMES, BUT I HAVE

544
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,870
STREET SENSE.

545
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,499
I TEND TO SEE THINGS BEFORE THEY
ACTUALLY HAPPEN KIND OF AND HAVE

546
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,750
INTUITIVENESS ABOUT THINGS.

547
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,546
SO I THINK I CAN BE ABLE TO MAKE
IT THROUGH THAT GAUNTLET TO BE

548
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,713
THE SOLE SURVIVOR.

549
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,840
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

550
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,216
WE'LL TAKE TURNS.

551
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,677
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

552
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,011
I'M NOT USING THE SAW.

553
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,015
ANYBODY WANTS TO USE THE SAW,
FEEL FREE, BUT I'M NOT USING THE

554
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,933
SAW.

555
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,768
>> YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
NEEDED SAW.

556
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,187
>> JOE AND I ARE WORK HORSES.

557
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,730
WE'VE GOT THE WISDOM TO KNOW.

558
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,442
BEFORE WE GO STRATEGIZING ABOUT
WINNING THE GAME, WE HAVE TO

559
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:03,942
STAY ALIVE!

560
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,360
THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

561
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,487
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SURVIVE
HERE.

562
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,530
>> STOP, STOP!

563
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,866
WE'RE COMING DOWN THE WHOLE
THING HERE.

564
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,992
>> YEAH.

565
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:16,163
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS CAMP
AS COMFORTABLE AS I CAN.

566
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,247
MOSTLY FOR ME AND JOE.

567
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:25,213
BECAUSE JOE AND I PLAN ON
STICKING AROUND A VERY LONG

568
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:25,922
TIME.

569
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,382
>> HOW ARE YOU LIKING THE GROUP?

570
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:27,716
>> GOOD.

571
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,341
>> YEAH?

572
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,301
>> YEAH.

573
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,136
>> ARE PEOPLE KIND OF LIKE WHAT
YOU EXPECTED?

574
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,722
>> YEAH WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE
FIRST MET DEBBIE, SHE WAS

575
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,100
REALLY, LIKE, CHATTY, CHATTY,
CHATTY.

576
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:37,934
I WAS LIKE OH, MY GOD.

577
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,144
I HOPE SHE SHUTS UP.

578
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,564
>> WHEN I FIRST SAW HER I WAS
LIKE SHE COULD BE SUPER TOUGH

579
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,401
AND COOL TO WORK WITH AND WHEN
SHE FIRST OPENED HER MOUTH I WAS

580
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,652
LIKE OH, MAYBE NOT.

581
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,906
DEBBIE TALKS, TALKS, TALKS, AND
TALKS SO HIGHLY OF HERSELF THAT

582
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,743
I START TO THINK THAT SHE MIGHT
JUST ANNOY EVERYBODY TO DEATH.

583
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,538
>> WE HAVE THAT GERIATRIC TINGE
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET

584
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,414
RID OF.

585
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,249
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE TOO
SLOW.

586
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,921
OLD JOE, A 72-YEAR-OLD RUNNING
THROUGH A GROUP CHALLENGE?

587
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:10,884
>> HE DOES SEEM LIKE THE MOST
LIKELY TO BE MEDEVACED.

588
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:11,718
>> DO YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE
FOUR OF US, THE CHILDREN?

589
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,886
>> I DO.

590
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,723
I FEEL LIKE THE FOUR OF US WOULD
REALLY HOLD TOGETHER WELL.

591
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,768
LIKE, I DON'T SEE ANYBODY, LIKE,
FLIPPING OUT OVER SOME STUPID

592
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,061
THING.

593
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,771
>> WHEN YOU HAVE SIX PEOPLE ON A
TRIBE, AND YOU KNOW THAT FOUR OF

594
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:27,734
US ARE GOING TO BE QUICKER, BOTH
PHYSICALLY AS WELL AS MENTALLY,

595
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,737
IT MAKES A HELL OF A LOT OF
SENSE TO TRY TO KEEP THE FOUR

596
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,863
YOUNGER ONES TOGETHER.

597
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:36,785
I THINK WE GET THE FOUR YOUNG
BUCKS AND GO TO THE MERGE.

598
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,912
>> I THINK THAT'S THE BEST PLAN
EVER.

599
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,622
I THINK WE'RE ALL EASY-GOING.

600
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,749
>> DON'T TALK TOO LOUDLY.

601
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,292
SOUND CARRIES IN THE WATER.

602
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,711
>> IN OUR GROUP WE'VE GOT FOUR
YOUNG PEOPLE AND TWO OLD PEOPLE.

603
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:51,174
THE FACT THEY SAY THEY'RE OLD
PEOPLE MEANS THEY ALREADY STICK

604
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,300
OUT.

605
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,677
WHO DO YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT
FIRST, GRANDMA OR GRASMS?

606
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,471
>> LET'S SEE HOW THEY DO IN THE
CHALLENGE.

607
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,974
>> JOE AND DEBBIE ARE
LOW-HANGING FRUIT SO THEY'RE

608
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:08,692
GOING TO BE EATEN FIRST.

609
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:21,121
>> I'M JUST GONNA DRAG THESE TWO
BACK WITH ME.

610
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:25,166
>> I'M GONNA LOOK AROUND TRY TO
SEE IF I CAN FIND SOME SIGNS FOR

611
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,711
THE IDOL.

612
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:32,299
THIS MORNING, WE WERE WALKING
AND EVERYBODY TURNED AROUND TO

613
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,635
TAKE THE BAMBOO BACK, SO I SAY I
HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE IDOL.

614
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,177
I HAVE NO CLUE.

615
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,305
BUT THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

616
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,808
THERE'S GOT TO BE AN IDOL
SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE.

617
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:46,062
THIS IS UNUSUAL THAT SOMEONE
WOULD HAVE THAT TREE HERE IN THE

618
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:46,604
MIDDLE OF THE TRAIL.

619
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,523
THIS MIGHT BE A SIGN.

620
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:55,530
IT'S GOTTA BE ONE OF THESE
TREES.

621
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,032
IT'S GOTTA BE IT.

622
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,868
I SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE I'M THE
TREE GUY.

623
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,286
>> WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE?

624
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,665
>> I HAVE A FEELING, LIKE, TAI'S
LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

625
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,709
>> YEAH, I HAD THAT FEELING AS
WELL.

626
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,420
>> WHEN WE ALL WALKED OFF, HE
WALKED RIGHT BACK TO WHERE THE

627
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,379
TREE MAIL THING WAS.

628
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,339
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

629
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,506
>> SHOULD WE GO OVER THERE?

630
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,049
>> YOU WANT TO?

631
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,216
>> LET'S DO IT.

632
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,926
>> LET'S DO IT.

633
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:23,558
>> OKAY, NOT THIS ONE.

634
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:31,775
GOTTA BE ONE OF THESE GUYS.

635
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,902
I HOPE I DON'T MISS IT.

636
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,445
OKAY.

637
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,572
I GOTTA LOOK CAREFULLY.

638
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,159
ALL THIS WORK.

639
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:45,747
ANYBODY COMING?

640
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,873
I HEARD THEM.

641
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,917
>> NO ONE NEEDS IT YET.

642
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,627
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHALLENGE.

643
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,586
LIKE, WE HAVE TIME.

644
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,798
>> IT DEFINITELY PAINTS A TARGET
ON YOUR BACK.

645
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,965
>> YEAH, IT DOES.

646
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,800
>> SORRY, TREE, I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING THAT I WANT.

647
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,784
>> I'M LOOKING AROUND, AND THEN

648
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,329
I SAW TAI, AND AS SOON AS I WALK
UP, HE KNEELS DOWN.

649
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,789
OOIK LIKE THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

650
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,834
AND I SEE HIM PATTING THE FLOOR,
AND I'M, LIKE, OKAY, WELL, THIS

651
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,962
GUY'S LOOKING FOR THE IDOL, AND
I'M JUST RIGHT AWAY SKETCH.

652
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:38,842
>> DID YOU GET A LITTLE LUCKY
OVER THERE?

653
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,760
CALEB WAS LIKE TAI'S LOOKING.

654
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,264
I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, WELL, WE'LL
SEE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW."

655
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,807
>> I'M LOOK HERE.

656
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,809
>> IS IT UNDER IT OR SOMETHING?

657
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,810
>> YOU DON'T HAVE THE NEW CLOOU.

658
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,021
>> NO, I DON'T HAVE THE CLUE.

659
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:56,818
I SMAWT IT MUST BE SOMEWHERE
NEAR THE TREE MAIL SO WE HAVE TO

660
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,069
LOOK FOR SIGNS.

661
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,156
>> YESTERDAY I FELT COMFORTABLE
WITH HIM BUT NOW I DON'T TRUST

662
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:06,286
YOU FOR A FREAKING SECOND.

663
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:06,953
>> I SCREWED EVERYTHING UP.

664
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,539
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME AT PULL.

665
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,667
THE FACT THAT I WENT AWAY FOR
HALF AN HOUR TO LOOK FOR THE

666
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,044
IDOL, AND I GOT CAUGHT.

667
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,005
>> IT'S CERTAINLY SUSPICIOUS.

668
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,548
>> HE COULD VERY WELL WITH IT.

669
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:23,011
>> YEAH, I THOUGHT I SAW HIM PUT
IT IN HIS POCKET OR SOMETHING.

670
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,679
>> HE DID?

671
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,681
WE'LL PRETEND HE DOESN'T HAVE
IT.

672
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:27,974
>> SHOULD WE TRY, US FIVE?

673
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,685
>> I JUST DON'T TRUST TAI.

674
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,687
HE'S BRINGING A LOT OF ANXIOUS
ENERGY.

675
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,064
HE MADE HIS BED, AND RIGHT NOW,
TAI IS NUMBER ONE FOR ME.

676
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:35,982
>> ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOOD.

677
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:44,699
>> YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

678
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,379
>> SHOULD I START UP HERE AND GO
DOWN?

679
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,382
>> I FIND IT EASIER TO START--
>> YOU'RE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE

680
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,884
DIRECTION.

681
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,093
YEAH.

682
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,887
>> IT'S SO HOT OUT HERE THAT I
DON'T THINK YOU EVEN REALIZE IN

683
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,389
THE MOMENT HOW HOT IT IS.

684
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,559
YOU REALIZE WHEN YOU START
MOVING SLOWER.

685
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,687
IT KIND OF SCRAMBLES YOUR BRAIN.

686
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,897
IT SLOWS YOU DOWN.

687
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,566
AND YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT.

688
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,028
I THINK THIS HEAT MIGHT BE ONE
OF THE PIGGEST FACTORS IN THIS

689
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:22,570
GAME.

690
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:22,946
>> I NEED SOME SHADE.

691
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,655
>> OH, YEAH.

692
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,741
WHY ARE YOU WORKING IN THE SUN.

693
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:31,037
>> I AM DEHYDRATED.

694
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,539
>> I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

695
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,584
I WENT TO A PREP SCHOOL, AND I
WORK IN SOCIAL MEDIA.

696
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,755
SO COMING FROM BOSTON IN THE
MIDDLE OF WINTER TO BEING

697
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,841
MAROONED HERE, IT'S LIKE GOING
FROM BLACK TO WHITE.

698
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,886
IT'S INTENSE.

699
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,933
I STARTED FEELING A LITTLE
WOBBLY AND DISCOMBOBALATED, AND

700
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,602
YOUR THOUGHTS STOP MOVING IN A
LIRN PATTERN.

701
00:30:54,686 --> 00:31:00,149
I JUST DON'T HAVE MY FACULTIES
ABOUT ME TO EVEN, LIKE SIT STILL

702
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,192
AND TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

703
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:05,113
>> WELL THEN YOU DO WHAT YOU
THINK YOU NEED TO DO.

704
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,156
>> CAN YOU GUYS JUST HELP ME.

705
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,949
>> SURE.

706
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,285
>> JUST, WITH, LIKE, FRUIT AND
WATER.

707
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:10,618
>> UH-HUH.

708
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,119
LAY DOWN.

709
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,955
>> YEAH, NEIL'S RIGHT.

710
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,957
COME UP HERE AND LAY DOWN AND
RELAX.

711
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,961
>> AUBRY COMES TO ME AND
IMMEDIATELY I KNEW SHE WAS

712
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:25,466
DEHYDRATED, HEAT EXHAUSTION, AND
ANXIETY-RIDDEN.

713
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,050
>> IT'S TOUGH.

714
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,094
>> MY MIND IT'S JUST SHOT.

715
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,097
>> SHE WAS ALSO ABSOLUTELY
OVERWHELMED WITH BEING THROWN

716
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,017
INTO A JUNGLE WITH FIVE
STRANGERS.

717
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,644
>> SEE HOW HOT YOU ARE?

718
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,356
>> YEAH.

719
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,652
I KNOW... THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE FOR ME.

720
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,361
>> NO PROBLEM.

721
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,112
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

722
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:46,404
>> THANK YOU, DEBBIE.

723
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,155
>> YES.

724
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,282
>> I CARE ABOUT THIS GAME.

725
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,660
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT, AND
MAYBE I WORKED IT UP TOO MUCH IN

726
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,786
MY OWN HEAD.

727
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,497
THIS SITUATION I'M IN ISN'T EVEN
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.

728
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:01,002
THIS IS ALL ABOUT MY OWN HEAD.

729
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:01,669
I'M A THINKER.

730
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,796
I GET STUCK IN MY OWN HEAD.

731
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,508
I KNOW THAT I BROUGHT THIS UPON
MYSELF.

732
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,802
IT'S THAT FEELING OF YOU CAN'T
EVEN MAKE THE CHOICE OF WHAT YOU

733
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,220
NEED TO DO FOR YOURSELF.

734
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,182
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION OF,
LIKE, I NEED TO DO THIS, THIS,

735
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,353
AND THIS, TO FEEL BETTER, TO
MAKE MYSELF FEEL BETTER.

736
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,565
>> AUBRY WASN'T, LIKE, ILL
DEHYDRATED.

737
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,694
SHE HADN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE
POINT OF, LIKE, CHAPPED LIPS.

738
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,364
SO FOR HER IT WAS REALLY MORE OF
AN ANXIETY ATTACK.

739
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:35,662
SHE WAS JUST FREAKING OUT ABOUT
FREAKING OUT.

740
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,413
>> YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

741
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,166
ONCE YOUR HYDRATED, ONCE WE HAVE
A FIRE, YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL

742
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,044
AWESOME AGAIN.

743
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,545
>> YOU'RE JUST GOING TO COOL
OFF.

744
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,924
>> I JUST WISH YOU GUYS GOT TO
MEET ME.

745
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,219
>> WHATEVER IMPRESSION SHE'S
GIVING OFF ON DAY TWO, I DO

746
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,555
THINK THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT RISK
SHE CRACKS AGAIN NEXT TIME

747
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,515
SOMETHING DOESN'T GO WELL.

748
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,558
>> WITH AUBRY BEING WEIRD AND
FREAKING OUT--

749
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,060
>> KEEP DRINKING.

750
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,269
YOU'LL BE FINE.

751
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:07,902
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A REPEAT OF
THE FIRST BRAINS, BEAUTY, AND

752
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:17,995
BRAWN WHERE BRAINS WERE NUTS AND
JUST GOT SHELLACKED.

753
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:33,302
BRAWN WHERE BRAINS WERE NUTS AND
JUST GOT SHELLACKED.

754
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,596
>> I'M ACTUALLY WORRIED.

755
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,100
I'M NOT SURE, BUT I THINK I GOT
A BUG IN MY EAR, AND I THOUGHT,

756
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:39,892
IT'S FINE.

757
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,810
IT WILL CRAWL OUT.

758
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,562
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

759
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:46,607
BUT INSTEAD OF CRAWLING OUT, IT
IS GETTING DEEPER IN MY EAR.

760
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,150
I CAN'T SLEEP.

761
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,445
I CAN'T GET COMFORTABLE.

762
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,281
IT'S JUST DISGUSTING HEARING
THESE LITTLE LEGS CRAWL AROUND

763
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,158
IN YOUR HEAD.

764
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,119
LIKE, IT'S DIGGING DEEPER INTO
MY EAR CANAL.

765
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,749
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT DOES TO A
PERSON.

766
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,251
EMOTIONALLY IT DOES A LOT, BUT
PHYSICALLY, WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE

767
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,878
IS IT DOING?

768
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,465
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BLOOD COMING
OUT OF MY EAR.

769
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,467
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING TO
ME.

770
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,135
IT'S SO PAINFUL.

771
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,305
I PREPARED TO FACE A LOT OUT
HERE, BUT I DIDN'T PREPARE FOR

772
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,182
SOME BUG TO MUNCH ME FROM THE
INSIDE.

773
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,169
>> MY EAR'S BLEEDING,
SWEETHEART, SEE.

774
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:48,836
>> UGH.

775
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,253
>> YEAH.

776
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:55,510
>> TREE MAIL!

777
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,805
>> ALL NIGHT, I HAVEN'T SLEPT,
LIKE, NOT EVEN A MINUTE.

778
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,014
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

779
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:03,309
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS INSIDE
ME THAT IS CAUSING MY EAR TO

780
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,185
BLEED.

781
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,772
IT IS SO PAINFUL, LIKE, IT HURTS
SO BAD.

782
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:11,484
LIKE, IT WILL GO FOR 30 SECONDS
AND HE'LL STOP FOR A MINUTE AND

783
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,193
HE STOPS.

784
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,529
I CAN HEAR HIM LITERALLY
DIGGING.

785
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,363
AH!

786
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:19,909
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUND LIKE.

787
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,160
HE'S GETTING FURTHER IN.

788
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,746
I THOUGHT HE WOULD CRAWL OUT,
BUT HE'S GOING FURTHER INSIDE MY

789
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,417
EAR, AND IT-- GOD, IT JUST HURTS
SO BAD.

790
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:33,047
>> WHAT IF SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH HER?

791
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:33,548
SHE GETS PULLED.

792
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,090
>> WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

793
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,466
>> IT CHANGES THINGS.

794
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,177
>> I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

795
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,346
WE NEED TO WIN THIS CHALLENGE
AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER, YOU

796
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:46,185
KNOW,... NOT BE ABLE TO
PARTICIPATE AND THEY PULL HER,

797
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,897
THEN WE'RE A MAN DOWN.

798
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,860
WE'LL SEE HOW THIS GOES.

799
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,696
>> IT IS A CONCERN GOING INTO A
CHALLENGE, THINKING THAT WE

800
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,448
MIGHT LOSE ONE OF OUR TRIBE
MATES BECAUSE SHE HAS A BUG IN

801
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,367
HER EAR.

802
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,453
I DO THINK I COULD BE ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK BECAUSE THEY WANT

803
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:10,710
A STRONGER TEAM, SO HOPEFULLY
JEN IS OKAY FOR THE CHALLENGE

804
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,754
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT US GOING
INTO THE CHALLENGE FOR FIVE

805
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,046
PEOPLE.

806
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,006
>> AH!

807
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,675
>> DO YOU WANT TO USE MY JACKET
FOR A PILLOW?

808
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,386
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU SOME
WATER OR ANYTHING.

809
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,596
>> POOR JENNY.

810
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,515
SHE'S BLEEDING AND IN SOME PAIN,
BUT SELFISHLY, I'M A LITTLE

811
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,434
WORRIED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE
TODAY.

812
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,436
IF WE DON'T WIN, THIS IT'S GOING
TO HURT ALL OF US.

813
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:42,491
SO, QUITE LITERALLY, FAILURE IS
NOT AN OPTION.

814
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:49,081
>> DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?

815
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,459
>> NO.

816
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,336
JUST--
>> I SEE IT!

817
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:53,669
EWWWW!

818
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,086
>> REALLY?

819
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,463
>> LOOK AT IT!

820
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,298
THERE'S A TAIL.

821
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:57,924
IT'S WIGGLING.

822
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,966
>> OH!

823
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,425
>> THERE IT IS!

824
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,136
>> GET IT!

825
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:02,470
>> IT'S GOING BACK IN.

826
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,347
HOLD ON,.

827
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,432
>> IT'S COMEOUTH, IT'S COMING
OUT.

828
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,018
THERE IT IS, THERE IT IS.

829
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,687
>> I'M GOING TO GET IT AS SOON
AS IT GETS OUT OF YOUR EAR.

830
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,983
>> EWWWW!

831
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,487
THAT LITTLE CRITTER WAS CLEAN,
CLEAR-- GOT YOUR BLOOD IN THERE

832
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,112
AND EVERYTHING.

833
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,864
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

834
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,492
>> EWW"P" THAT WAS JUST AMAZING.

835
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,660
>> KILL IT!

836
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,371
>> AT FIRST I WASN'T SURE HOW
LONG WAS IT WAS AND IT ENDS UP

837
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,541
BEING ABOUT YA BIG, IT'S PRETTY
LONG FOR AN EAR CANAL.

838
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,045
SO I COULD SEE HOW SHE WAS IN
PAIN UPON.

839
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,004
>> DOES IT FEEL BETTER?

840
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,547
>> I FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN.

841
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,133
WE'RE GOING TO KILL THIS
CHALLENGE BECAUSE I'M SO PISSED

842
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:41,592
OFF.

843
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,468
>> YEAH!

844
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,678
JENNY'S BACK.

845
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,515
I FEEL AMAZING, BACK TO WHAT I
WAS BEFORE, READY TO TAKE ON ALL

846
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,849
THESE CHALLENGES.

847
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,395
I GOT THIS, 39 DAYS, NO PROBLEM.

848
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:08,452
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

849
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:22,383
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELCOME TO
THE FIRST CHALLENGE OF

850
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,592

854
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,437
ONCE EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD, ONE
PERSON WILL DIVE DOWN TO

855
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,730

856
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:40,067
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL FOUR PADDLES,
YOU'LL THEN RACE TO SHORE WHERE

857
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,571

YOU'LL THEN PUSH IT TO THE TOP.

859
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,366
ONCE YOU'RE AT THE TOP, YOU HAVE
A DECISION TO MAKE.

860
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:53,914

WHILE STANDING ON A WOBBLY BEAM.

862
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,587

CHOOSE THE RIGHT ONE FOR YOUR
TRIBE, YOU CAN FINISH MUCH

864
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,468
FASTER.

865
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:10,473
THE FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH
WIN IMMUNITY, ARE SAFE FROM THE

866
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,265

THEIDE DOES THE SAME THING-- IT

869
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,733

IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.

00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:42,656
BEAUTY HAS BLOWN A HUGE LEAD BUT
IS QUICKLY GAINING ON BRAWN.

1024
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,198
YOU'RE GOOD.

1025
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,491
HOOK IT IN, BRAWN.

1026
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,325
MAKE YOUR CHOICE.

1027
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:45,993
WHICH BOX?

1028
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,494
>> PUZZLE.

1029
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,705
>> Jeff: RON UNTYING THE
PUZZLE BOX.

1030
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,664

>> Jeff: THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE
THE SURE THING.

1032
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,836
JENNY AND ALECIA HAVE SOME WORK
TO DO TO CATCH UP.

1033
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,463
>> GET THE ( BLEEP ) PIECES!

1034
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:03,510
>> Jeff: WHAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE IS DEAD LAST AND RIGHT NOW

1035
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,972
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE
BEAUT WHOA HAS BLOWN A MASSIVE

1036
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:07,514
LEAD.

1037
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,892
KEEP DIGGING, BEAUTY!

1038
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,852
HOOK IT IN!

1039
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,855
GPUZZLE OR DEXITATOR!

1040
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:21,862
>> PUZZLE EXPWHR BEAUTY WILL GO
FOR PUZZLE, TOO.

1041
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:27,868
NOBODY WILL GO FOR THE HAIL MARY
AND TRY THE DEXTERITY.

1042
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,995
IT IS JENNY AND ALECIA SOLVING
THE PUZZLE FOR THE BRAWN TRIBE,

1043
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:34,541
AND LIZ AND AUBRY FOR THE BRAIN
TRIBE.

1044
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,250
BRAINS STILL IN THE LEAD.

1045
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,376
>> YEAH!

1046
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,046
>> Jeff: LIZ AND AUBRY DOING A
NICE JOB WORKING TOGETHER.

1047
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,214
>> YEAH!

1048
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,425
>> Jeff: JENNY DOING ALL THE
WORK FOR THE BRAWN TRIBE.

1049
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,054
>> ALECIA, YOU WANT TO TAG?

1050
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,055
>> YES.

1051
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,515
>> Jeff: ALECIA IS OUT.

1052
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,683
SCOT IT COMING IN.

1053
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,893
ALECIA CANNOT COME BACK IN.

1054
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:57,022
SHE IS OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.

1055
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:01,568
BRAIN, PIECE BY PIECE GETTING
CLOSE TO WINNING THIS IMMUNITY

1056
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,819
CHALLENGE.

1057
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,572
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CLUES
CAN I FIND TO HELP ME SOLVE IT

1058
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,534
BECAUSE THE OTHER TRIBES HAVE
HAD A BIG HEAD START.

1059
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:12,579
AUBRY MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS
FOR THE BRAINS.

1060
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,082
>> JEFF, JEFF!

1061
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,251
>> Jeff: BRAIN TRIBE HAS IT!

1062
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,046
BRAIN TRIBE WINS IMMUNITY AND
REWARD!

00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,757
FIRST CHALLENGE OF "SURVIVOR:
KOAH RONG"!

1064
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,550
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE MORE.

1065
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,010
IT'S GOING TO BE BRAWN OR
BEAUTY.

1066
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:32,808
ONE WILL GO BACK TO CAMP, ONE
WILL GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1067
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:37,271
BRAIN HAS ALREADY WON IMMUNITY
AND A MASSIVE FIRE-MAKING KIT.

1068
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,438
THIS IS A RACE.

1069
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:43,277
IT IS JULIA AND ANNA WITH
ANOTHER PIECE FOR BEAUTY.

1070
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,653
ANNA WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

1071
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:45,737
>> LET'S GO, SCOT.

1072
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,739
>> THERE WE GO, THERE WE GO.

1073
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,950
>> GEN WEANOTHER PIECE FOR

1074
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,827
IT IS BACK AND FORTH.

1075
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,829
PIECE VERSUS PIECE, EACH TRIBE
GETTING CLOSER.

1076
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,455

>> LET'S GO!

1080
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,461
KEEP GOING!

1081
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,462
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE!

1082
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,130
>> Jeff: THIS IS NECK AND NECK
RIGHT NOW.

1083
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,966
>> YES, YES, YES.

1084
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,677
>> COME ON, Y'ALL, WE'RE IN
THIS!

1085
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,803
WE'RE IN THIS!

1086
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,598
>> YES, YES!

1087
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,223

00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,142
>> COME ON, GUYS.

>> Jeff: JENNY WITH ANOTHER
PIECE FOR BRAWN.

1090
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,021
BEAUT YOU DOWN TO THREE PIECES
IF THEY FIT.

1091
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,981
>> SOMETHING IS NOT IN THE RIGHT
PLACE.

1092
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:21,648
>> COME ON, BRAWN.

1093
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,149
WE'RE IN THIS.

1094
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,817
WE'RE IN THIS.

1095
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,484
LET'S GET IT!

1096
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,320
>> Jeff: BRAWN IS VERY CLOSE.

1097
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,487
>> LET'S GO, SCOT.

1098
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,530
>> GOT IT!

1099
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:32,993
>> Jeff: BOTH TRIBES DOWN TO
THEIR LAST PIECE!

1100
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:33,660
BEAUTY HAS IT!

1101
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,164
BEAUTY WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD.

1102
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,875
SENDING THE BRAWN TRIBE TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY

1103
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:50,844
WILL BE THE FIRST PERSON VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME.

1104
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,012
BRAIN TRIBE, CONGRATULATIONS.

1105
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,973
FIRST WIN OF THE SEASON.

1106
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,017
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

1107
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,480
IN ADDITION, A MASSIVE
FIRE-MAKING KIT.

1108
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,022
COME GRAB IT.

1109
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,523
TAKE IT BACK TO CAMP.

1110
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:08,153
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

1111
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:11,073
BEAUTY TRIBE, IMMUNITY FOR YOU
AS WELL.

1112
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,699
NOBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1113
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:19,164
( APPLAUSE )
IN ADDITION, NOT A BIG

1114
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,374
FIRE-MAKING KIT BUT FLINT.

1115
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:20,666
HERE IT IS.

1116
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,583
>> YEAH!

1117
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,711
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, BEAUTY,
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1118
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,879
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1119
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:26,380
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1120
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,340
NOBODY GOING HOME.

1121
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,509
ALL RIGHT, BRAWN TRIBE, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU.

1122
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,218
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1123
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,011
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1124
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,179
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

1125
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:38,725
>> IT IS RISKATE TRIBAL BECAUSE
I'M NOT A PUZZLE WIDDARD!

1126
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,604
BUT DARNELL DROPPED THE GLASSES
AND TOTALLY SCREWED UP THE

1127
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,855
CHALLENGE.

1128
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,107
SO THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO STAY
IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW IS TO TRY

1129
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,233
TO GET THEM TO VOTE OFF DARNELL.

1130
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,095
>> NO, THAT WAS MY FAULT.

1131
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,764
>> I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

1132
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,598
IT WAS MY FAULT.

1133
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,266
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

1134
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,309
I MEAN, I LOST THE GOGGLES.

1135
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,271
AND THAT PUT US WAY BEHIND.

1136
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:28,316
GROWING UP IN CHICAGO, I WAS A
LIFEGUARD, BUT I NEVER KNEW THAT

1137
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,026
SEA WATER WAS THAT MURKY.

1138
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,446
LIKE, YOU COULDN'T SEE NOTHING.

1139
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:36,742
THAT WAS A HARD-ASS CHALLENGE,
PUSHING THAT BOAT.

1140
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,286
>> WHEN PEOPLE IN THIS GAME ARE
NOT TALKING TO YOU, THEY'RE

1141
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,120
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

1142
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,913
WE HAVE TRIBAL TONIGHT.

1143
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,874
I'M A GOOD CANDIDATE TO GO HOME.

1144
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,125
SO I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I GOTTA
DO.

1145
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:49,463
YOU ALL SAVE ME TONIGHT, I
PROMISE YOU'LL HAVE MY LOYALTY--

1146
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,966
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NO
MERGE, LIKE.

1147
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,801
>> WE'RE VOTING BLONDIE.

1148
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,635
>> BLONDIE, IT'S DONE.

1149
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,804
>> I'M JUST LETTING YOU ALL
KNOW.

1150
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,848
>> WE CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH
STUPID TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

1151
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,476
>> WE HAVE TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT, AND THE TWO PEOPLE THAT

1152
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,062
ARE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, IT'S
DARN EXPEL ALECIA.

1153
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,482
BUT REALLY THERE'S JUST ONE IN
MY OPINION.

1154
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,192
DARNELL LOSES THE MASK.

1155
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:15,947
HE APOLOGIZED, BUT THE DEAD
WEIGHT IN THE CHALLENGE, IT WAS

1156
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:16,490
JUST UNACCEPTABLE.

1157
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,158
>> HE'S GOING HOME.

1158
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,660
WE'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

1159
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,872
>> I MEAN, IT JUST MAKES ME
QUESTION, THOUGH, HOW DO I KNOW?

1160
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:24,998
>> LET IT HAPPEN.

1161
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:25,999
>> ALL RIGHT.

1162
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,501
>> SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA LET THE
WORLD COME TO YOU.

1163
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,877
YOU CAN'T FORCE EVERYTHING.

1164
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,377
>> THAT'S TRUE.

1165
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,129
>> TAKE IT ON FAITH.

1166
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,172
WE'RE DEALING STRAIGHT.

1167
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,759
AND I'M TELLING YOU--
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN TRUST

1168
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:39,387
SCOT, BUT IF I CAN JUST TRY AND
BE A MASTER MANIPULATOR AND THEN

1169
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:43,225
VOTE DARNELL, THAT'S THE ONLY
OPTION RIGHT NOW I REALLY HAVE.

1170
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,977
I KNOW I'M AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT
NOW.

1171
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:46,812
>> YOU'RE NOT.

1172
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,396
>> I THINK WE SHOULD VOTE
DARNELL OUT.

1173
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,691
>> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME FREE

1174
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:51,983
ADVICE.

1175
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,193
>> OKAY.

1176
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,987
>> THE ONLY THING I HAVE AGAINST
YOU RIGHT NOW IS THE CONSTANT

1177
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:56,279
SCHEMING.

1178
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:56,696
>> OKAY.

1179
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,241
>> YOU'RE GOOD.

1180
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,200
>> AND DOES HE HAVE AN IDOL?

1181
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,202
I KNOW HE'S BEEN LOOKING.

1182
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,370
>> NO, HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

1183
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:07,374
>> DO YOU HAVE ONE?

1184
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,709
>> NEVER SAID I DID, NEVER SAID
I DIDN'T.

1185
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,336
BUT HERE'S THE THING, LISTEN.

1186
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,339
>> THAT JUST BLEW MY MIND.

1187
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,175
I THREW HER A FREAKING BONE.

1188
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,219
YOU'RE PUSHING YOURSELF OUT OF
THIS GAME.

1189
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,053
IT'S OVER FOR ME.

1190
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,012
I'M DONE.

1191
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:21,346
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

1192
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,514
>> OKAY.

1193
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,392
>> WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE HER
BLATANT HINT TO JUST CALM DOWN

1194
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:29,896
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING YOU'RE
DOING RIGHT NOW IS KILLING

1195
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,564
YOURSELF.

1196
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,523
>> WE ARE VOTING FOR DARNELL.

1197
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,274
>> OKAY.

1198
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:35,068
>> BLONDIE, SHE'S PISSING ME
OFF.

1199
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:38,697
THE ONLY REASON I SAY DARNELL HE
JUMPED IN THE WATER, AND LOST

1200
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,740
OUR GOGGLES.

1201
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,242
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

1202
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,452
>> I'M NOT REALLY TO PRESSED.

1203
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,704
I DON'T JUST-- WHATEVER.

1204
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:46,413
>> SO WE'RE SET.

1205
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,873
>> YUP.

1206
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,251
>> THEY WANT TO VOTE DARNELL
OUT, BUT I DO PREFER ALECIA TO

1207
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,588
GO JUST BASED ON THE SIMPLE FACT
THAT SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

1208
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,257
I'D PREFER FOR DARNELL TO STICK
AROUND BECAUSE OF OUR INITIAL

1209
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,300
ALLIANCE.

1210
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,802
THE MEMBER NUMBERS I HAVE, THE
BETTER IT IS FOR ME.

1211
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:04,222
SO WHEN I GET TO TRIBAL, I'M
GOING TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW

1212
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,309
WHO NEEDS TO GO HOME.

1213
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,345
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.

1214
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:48,516
GO AHEAD AND GET A TORCH, DIP IT
IN AND GET FIRE.

1215
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,605
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE FIRE

1216
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,316
REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE, AND WHEN
YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE YOU,

1217
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,527
AND, SADLY, THAT WILL BE THE
CASE FOR SOMEBODY TONIGHT

1218
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:04,491
BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO VOTE OUT
THE FIRST PERSON FROM THIS GAME.

1219
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,452
SO, JAISON, LET'S TALK ABOUT
FIRST IMPRESSIONS.

1220
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,497
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE TO REALLY
SEE WHO'S ON YOUR TRIBE, WHAT

1221
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,998
WAS YOUR REACTION?

1222
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:12,707
>> I WAS SATISFIED.

1223
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,543
GOT A FORMER BASKETBALL PLAYER.

1224
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,296
WE GOT THE NINTH TOUGHEST WOMAN
IN THE WORLD.

1225
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,342
YOU KNOW, I SIT WITH SOME PEOPLE
I BELIEVE CAN STAND UP TO MY

1226
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,468
HIGH STANDARDS.

1227
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,135
>> Jeff: SOME PEOPLE.

1228
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,387
>> THAT'S RIGHT, SOME PEOPLE.

1229
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:25,845
>> Jeff: NOT EVERYBODY.

1230
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,722
>> NOT EVERYBODY.

1231
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,184
NOT EVEN CLOSE TO EVERYBODY.

1232
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:34,145
>> Jeff: WHO STANDS OUT,
JAISON, AS SOMEBODY WHO MAYBE

1233
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,313
CAN'T MEET YOUR EXPECTATION?

1234
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,524
>> THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE ON OUR
TRIBE AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM

1235
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,986
SAYING THE NAME, BLONDIE AND
DASCHLE.

1236
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,821
>> Jeff: BLONDIE DOESN'T EVEN
GET A NAME.

1237
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:46,157
>> WE CAN JUST GO WITH ALECIA.

1238
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,577
>> Jeff: SO WHAT'S THAT FEEL
LIKE TO HAVE ONE OF YOUR TRIBE

1239
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,162
MEMBERS SAY YOU'RE NOT GETTING
IT DONE?

1240
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,414
>> IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD, JEFF.

1241
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,707
IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.

1242
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,543
I MEAN, I KNOW RIGHT NOW THEY DO
SEE ME AS ONE OF THE WEAKER ONES

1243
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,838
BUT I DO HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS
WITH THIS TRIBE AND HONESTLY, I

1244
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,716
DON'T SEE MYSELF AS THE WEAKEST
LINK IN THIS TRIBE.

1245
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,052
>> Jeff: DARNELL, YOUR NAME
MENTIONED AS SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T

1246
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,554
GETTING IT DONE AS OF NOW.

1247
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,014
>> I'LL BE HONEST, JEFF.

1248
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,515
I WAS ONE OF THE KEY REASONES
YES WE LOST TODAY.

1249
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,225
I STEPPED UP.

1250
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,518
I SAID I WANT THAT OPPORTUNITY.

1251
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:17,522
SO I DOVE IN FIRST, LOST THE
GOGGLES, AND THAT PUT US WAY

1252
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,565
BEHIND.

1253
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,109
BUT YOU KNOW, I WENT OUT THERE
AND I TRIED MY BEST.

1254
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:26,406
>> JEFF, HE FLAT OUT OFFERED
IT-- "I CAN DIVE."

1255
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,075
WE DIDN'T QUESTION.

1256
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,243
OKAY, YOU'RE THE DIVE.

1257
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:33,747
I'VE BEEN SNORKELING SINCE I WAS
12 YEARS OLD, AND EVERYBODY

1258
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:38,251
KNOWS THE FIRST RULE OF DIVING
IS YOU HOLD ON BECAUSE IT COMES

1259
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,252
OFF.

1260
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:39,753
>> Jeff: DARNELL, YOU'RE
TAKING A LOT OF HEAT.

1261
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:40,920
>> I KNOW I AM.

1262
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,798
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE ANY
EXCUSE.

1263
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:44,758
I'M ONLY IT.

1264
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,553
>> Jeff: ALECIA, DARNELL SAYS
THAT'S RIGHT.

1265
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,679
I EARNED THIS.

1266
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:53,099
>> WE DO HAVE TO KEEP THIS TRIBE
STRONG, JEFF.

1267
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,434
AND I'M A MENTAL GIANT.

1268
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,228
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE STRUGGLES,
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BREAK DOWN

1269
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,146
OUT HERE.

1270
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,647
I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT FIGHTING
FOR OUR TRIBE.

1271
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,150
I'M GOING TO WORK MY BUTT OFF IN
CHALLENGES AND I WILL STEP UP

1272
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,070
AND I REALLY WANT TO BE HERE AND
I THINK THEY KNOW THAT.

1273
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,615
>> Jeff: SIDNEY, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE YOU'RE CONTAINED NAY BOX

1274
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:13,203
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT
WHILE LISTENING TO ALANDMARK'S

1275
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,287
ANSWERS, BANGING OFF THE SIDE.

1276
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,624
>> I AM, JEFF, I THINK SHE'S
SAYING THAT FOR SHOW THAN

1277
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,751
BELIEVING SHE IS MENTAL STRONG.

1278
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,628
>> I AM HONEST WITH YOU GUYS.

1279
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:25,173
I AM NOT GOING TO SAY I CAN DO
SOMETHING WHEN I CAN'T.

1280
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,341
LIKE THE CHALLENGE.

1281
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,968
I TRIED TO DO THE PUZZLE AND WE
SWITCHED OUT.

1282
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,639
>> WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN I'LL
BUST MY ASS TO TRY AND DO IT.

1283
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,142
THE MINUTE YOU SAY YOU CAN'T,
YOU LOST BEFORE YOU START.

1284
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,352
>> I DO AGREE WITH THAT.

1285
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:41,272
I'LL GO OUT AND TRY MY BEST AND
WON'T QUIT FIGHTING FOR IT.

1286
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,317
TODAY, DARNELL DIDN'T GO DOWN
AND TRY AND FIGHT AND GET THE

1287
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:44,776
MASK.

1288
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:45,360
HE CAME BACK UP.

1289
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,402
I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN UP.

1290
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,488
>> I ALSO PADDLED THE BOAT AND
PUSHED THE BOAT UP.

1291
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,656
YOU DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

1292
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,198
YOU DIDN'T ROW.

1293
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,366
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

1294
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,701
IT'S EASY TO SAY, "I DID A
PUZZLE.

1295
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:58,164
I KNOW I MEASED UP, BUT I
GUARANTEE YOU, I'M GOING TO GO

1296
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,916
OUT THERE AND I'M GOING TO MAKE
IT HAPPEN.

1297
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,669
>> Jeff: DARNELL, IT FEELS
LIKE THERE IS A REALLY HEAVY

1298
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,962
WEIGHT ON YOU RIGHT NOW.

1299
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:07,006
>> WHAT I WENT THROUGH TODAY WAS
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES OF

1300
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,467
MY LIFE, A HEAVY WEIGHT, JEFF.

1301
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,343
I REALLY FEEL BAD.

1302
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,804
>> Jeff: COMPARE THIS TO LIFE
BACK HOME.

1303
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,682
HAVE YOU HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES
IN TERMS OF BEING CHALLENGED

1304
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,684
THAT WOULD RIVAL THIS?

1305
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,187
>> THINGS WASN'T ALWAYS EASY FOR
ME SO, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS HAD TO

1306
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,482
FIGHT FOR EVERYTHING.

1307
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,735
AND TO JUST LOSE, IT HURTS.

1308
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:32,198
I DO NOT WANT TO DISAPPOINT NO
ONE UP HERE AT ALL.

1309
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:36,536
LIKE, I LET ALL THESE PEOPLE
DOWN AND IT HURTS.

1310
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:41,374
IT HURTS BAD.

1311
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:45,712
>> Jeff: JENNY, CAN YOU RELATE
OR EMPATHIZE TO BEING IN

1312
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,504
DARNELL'S SITUATION?

1313
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,714
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1314
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,925
WHEN HE SAID HE HASN'T HAD IT
EASY IN LIFE, WOW, AS SOON AS HE

1315
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,220
SAID, THAT I WAS LIKE OH!

1316
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,890
EMPATHY STRINGS JUST GOT PULLED
A MILE.

1317
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,224
I'VE LOST A LOT AS WELL.

1318
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,726
AND YOU GET TIRED OF LOSING.

1319
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,727
THAT'S WHAT I THINK HE'S GETTING
AT.

1320
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,980
>> Jeff: SO, JAISON, FIRST
VOTE, OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN

1321
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:04,397
IMPORTANT ONE.

1322
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,857
IT SETS A TONE.

1323
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,066
DIFFICULT DECISION IN YOUR MIND
RIGHT NOW?

1324
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:12,947
>> I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,
SITTING HERE I DID THINK AND SAY

1325
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,742
ARE WE MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE?

1326
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,369
>> Jeff: SCOT, THERE'S A LOT
GOING ON AT TRIBAL RIGHT NOW.

1327
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,454
IT'S ONLY SIX PEOPLE.

1328
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,456
IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY LAYERS
THERE CAN BE.

1329
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,582
>> BUT THAT'S WHAT TRIBAL'S
ABOUT.

1330
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,918
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH THEIR
BACKS AGAINST THE WALL.

1331
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,087
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE
IT'S NOT THEIR BACK AGAINST THE

1332
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:28,671
WALL.

1333
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,839
>> Jeff: AS THEY SHOULD.

1334
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,257
>> YEAH, THEY'RE DOING WHAT
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

1335
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:36,429
SO, YEAH, THERE'S A LITTLE
PING-PONG MATCH GOING ON.

1336
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:37,722
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TIME TO
FIND OUT WHICH ONE OF YOU IS

1337
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,390
GOING HOME.

1338
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,100
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1339
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:51,194
DARNELL, YOU'RE
UP.

1340
00:58:51,277 --> 00:59:02,622
DARNELL, YOU'RE
UP.

1341
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:11,673
>> YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO IRK
MY SOUL, A LOT.

1342
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:21,140
>> YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO IRK
MY SOUL, A LOT.

1343
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:32,318
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

1344
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,655
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1345
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:40,326
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1346
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,327
OKAY.

1347
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,412
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

1348
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,538
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1349
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,164
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1350
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,293
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1351
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:55,341
FIRST VOTE, ALECIA.

1352
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:55,842
DARNELL.

1353
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,803
ALECIA.

1354
00:59:58,886 --> 00:59:59,595
DARNELL.

1355
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:06,185
TWO VOTES ALECIA, TWO VOTES
