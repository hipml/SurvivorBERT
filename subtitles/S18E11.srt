00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,378
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:04,838
>> I want you to think about the

4
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,006
alliance with Stephen and J.T.

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,216
I have the power alliance.

6
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,843
Commanding my officers like I

7
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,636
was born to do-- hence my name,

8
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,595
the Dragonslayer.

9
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,763
Sierra's going tonight,

10
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,389
no-brainer.

11
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,140
>> You're gonna be the next to

12
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:15,890
go.

13
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:16,766
You're not gonna be able to

14
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,392
change that.

15
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,643
>> Given another chance, I would

16
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,520
prove I<i> am</i> a loyal person.

17
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,771
>> Am I gonna give you a second

18
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,480
chance?

19
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,398
Probably not.

20
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,733
>> There's a large part of me

21
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:33,199
that prays for a miracle.

22
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,159
>> PROBST: Ninth person voted

23
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,452
out and the second member of our

24
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,871
jury:

25
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,288
Tyson.

26
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,081
Another Tribal Council,

27
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,082
another blindside.

28
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,710
This is shaping up to be a

29
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,670
battle to the end.

30
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,755
Seven are left.

31
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,841
Who will be voted out tonight?

32
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,721
>> You rock, Sierra.

33
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,097
That was a big one.

34
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,141
>> I thought I was going home.

35
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,768
I totally thought I was going

36
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,602
home.

37
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,811
It's crazy.

38
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,563
I couldn't have asked for a

39
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,147
better Tribal.

40
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,647
>> Coach, I don't want you

41
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,316
or Debbie to feel like you were

42
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,275
out of the loop.

43
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,651
I knew you would not want to go

44
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,736
against your word with Tyson.

45
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,361
>> Right.

46
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,529
>> The reason that we didn't

47
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,572
tell Debbie and Coach that we

48
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,364
were gonna vote out Tyson is

49
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,282
'cause we didn't want them

50
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,283
scrambling and changing their

51
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,034
plan.

52
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,659
We knew what their votes were

53
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,494
gonna be.

54
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,495
We could safely get rid of Tyson

55
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,329
without telling them.

56
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,331
>> It was a good move, guys.

57
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,791
And I'm glad... I appreciate you

58
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,583
not telling me.

59
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,751
>> Bold and brilliant tonight,

60
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,168
guys.

61
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,461
I mean, I've got really good

62
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,504
intuition, you know...

63
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,213
>> Yeah.

64
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,506
>> ...and I didn't see it

65
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:29,714
coming.

66
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,382
>> Yeah, but I don't want you to

67
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,425
be mad at me, Coach.

68
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,718
>> I'm not in the least.

69
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,260
I appreciate you guys not

70
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,678
telling me.

71
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,304
>> Both Coach and Debbie

72
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,681
realized that the dynamics of

73
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,974
the tribe had suddenly,

74
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,309
dramatically shifted, and they

75
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,560
were trying to curry favor with

76
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:42,727
us.

77
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,479
So basically anything we had

78
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,522
done was the greatest thing that

79
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,564
had ever been accomplished.

80
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,816
You know, "What a tremendous

81
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,483
blindside."

82
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,984
It worried me a little bit

83
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:50,568
because I would rather have an

84
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,905
honest blowout than have people

85
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,740
smiling saccharine smiles at me

86
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,908
and, you know, plotting

87
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:57,408
something else.

88
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,493
>> Absolutely no hard feelings.

89
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,202
>> Thanks, Coach.

90
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,372
>> Okay? I mean it. I mean it.

Kind of like a snake.

Stephen, J.T., and I talked

108

about all of us being there

109
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,838
towards the end, but do you

110
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,882
believe them?

111
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,010
That's the question of the day.

112
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,560
It's dangerous with Stephen and

113
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,103
Taj and J.T. together, and if

114
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,981
we take out Sierra, and then

115
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,483
Erinn next, they have everything

116
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,692
in line with what they need.

117
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,444
Then they can take me out and

118
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,820
then you out.

119
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,322
I would have bet my life that

120
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,823
Tyson was still gonna be here

121
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,366
today.

122
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,117
There is not any downtime.

123
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,535
You've got to work your people.

124
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,204
Every move is critical now,

125
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,705
and the next two people

126
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,456
supposedly that are on the

127
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,499
chopping block are Erinn and

128
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,000
Sierra.

129
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,126
That takes Timbira down to two

130
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,835
immediately.

131
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,753
Now where do we go?

132
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,129
I am not gonna be happy going

133
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:15,922
out fifth.

134
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,923
And I'm not gonna be happy you

135
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,008
going out fourth.

136
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,554
You and me, Sierra, and Erinn?

137
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,430
>> Otherwise, we're taking out

138
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,391
all our people, and then you and

139
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,226
I are sitting ducks, with no

140
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,477
leverage.

141
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,813
If we could pull all of the

142
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,355
Timbira tribe members back

143
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,274

144
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,651
Coach, and myself, we would

145
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,487
outnumber Jalapao-- Taj, Stephen

146
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,365
and J.T.-- and maybe be able to

147
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,451

rest of the tribe.

155
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,224
I have a series of questions.

156
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,684
You're each gonna answer these

157
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,435
questions in private.

158
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,021

159
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:13,563
and then I'll explain the

160
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,064
challenge.

161
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,607

00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,442
find a private spot.

tallied the results.

00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,164
You're now going to guess what

168
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,790
the group said.

169
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,334
Whose name came up the most

170
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:34,959
often?

171
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,753
This may differ from what you've

172
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,920
said individually.

173
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,255
We are looking now for the

174
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,048
consensus.

175
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,466
Each time you get one right, you

176
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,383
get to make one chop on another

177
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,302
tribe member's rope.

178
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,553
When your rope has been chopped

179
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,596
three times...

180
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:46,763

00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,237
when you get there.

195
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,281
You'll also join a local family

196
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,574
for a home-cooked, traditional

197
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,617
Brazilian feast.

198
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,285
>> Oh...

199
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,161
>> PROBST: The winner will also

200
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,163
send one person to Exile Island.

201
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,122
A lot at stake?

202
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:13,748
Worth playing for?

203
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,582
>> OTHERS: Yeah. Yes.

204
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,750
>> PROBST: Go ahead and pick up

205
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,335
your boards.

206
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,295
Here we go, first question.

207
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,546
"Who has not lived up to their

208
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,548
potential?"

209
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,175
Remember, you are guessing who

210
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,219
you think got the most votes.

211
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,637
Everybody reveal.

212
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,098
A lot of votes for Coach,

213
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,516
couple of votes for Sierra.

214
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,101
The person whose name came up

215
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,685
the most often to this question

216
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,728
was...

217
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,063
Coach.

218
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,980
Debbie got it right.

219
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:38,856
Erinn got it right.

220
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,774
Sierra got it right.

221
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,525
<i>Coach</i> got it right,

222
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,735
and Taj got it right.

223
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,611
All right, Erinn, you're up

224
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,904
first.

225
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:45,822
Take your shot.

226
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,825
First blood.

227
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,910
So many choices.

228
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,749
>> Erinn!

229
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,251
>> PROBST: Sierra with the first

230
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,043
hit on her rope.

231
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,378
Two more, and she is out.

232
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,713
Debbie, you're up.

233
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,049
>> What?!

234
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:05,633
>> PROBST: J.T. takes a hit.

235
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,052
He's got two left before he's

236
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:08,594
out of this challenge.

237
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,470
Taj, you're up.

238
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,430
>> Little Debbie, it's not

239
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:11,681
personal.

240
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,640
I just want to eat.

241
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,517
>> It's okay.

242
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,726
I still love you, Taj.

243
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,727
>> I love you, too.

244
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,354
>> PROBST: Coach, the man who

245
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:18,855
has not lived up to his

246
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,940
potential, now gets to take a

247
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:21,941
whack at somebody.

248
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,111
>> Oh, wow.

249
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,654
>> PROBST: Coach whacks Sierra.

250
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,905
Sierra takes her second hit in

251
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,365
this first round.

252
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:29,991
Sierra.

253
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,534
>> I was already going for you,

254
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:31,701
Coach.

255
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,411
>> Oh...

256
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,036
>> PROBST: Coach takes his first

257
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,329
hit.

258
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:35,872
All right, end of round one.

259
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,832
Sierra, the only person down to

260
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,250
her last hit.

261
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:39,792
Next question: "Who would

262
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,295
squander the million dollars the

263
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:42,587
quickest?"

264
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,797
Who would waste this money

265
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,549
faster than anybody else?

266
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,801
Everybody reveal.

267
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,511
A lot of names came up.

268
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,471
The correct answer...

269
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,389
Sierra.

270
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,640
J.T. got it right.

271
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,892
Debbie got it right.

272
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,851
Erinn got it right.

273
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,061
All right, Debbie, you're up.

274
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,271
Erinn takes her first hit.

275
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,898
>> Sorry, Erinn.

276
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,194
>> PROBST: J.T., you're up.

277
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,320
>> Oh, J.T.!

278
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,905
>> PROBST: And with that, Sierra

279
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,907
is out of the challenge.

280
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,283
>> Everyone hacked my rope

281
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,159
first.

282
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,744
I think that a lot of people are

283
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,162
being hard on me because I

284
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,371
think a lot of people still want

285
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,247
me to go home.

286
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,082
And yeah, it hurts.

287
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,877
>> PROBST: Erinn, you're up.

288
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,754
Debbie takes her second hit.

289
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,255
She's down to just one hit left

290
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,381
on her rope.

291
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,591
Next question: "Who would never

292
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:33,429
survive on their own?"

293
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,932
Everybody reveal.

294
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,851
J.T. and Coach said Sierra.

295
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,853
Everybody else said Debbie,

296
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,063
<i>including</i> Debbie.

297
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:42,647
>> I would have no one to talk

298
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,232
to, Jeff.

299
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,066
>> PROBST: The correct answer

300
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:45,608
is... Debbie.

301
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,693
Stephen got it right.

302
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,110
Debbie got it right.

303
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:48,653
Erinn it right,

304
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,738
and Taj got it right.

305
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,658
Taj, you're up.

306
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,993
Coach takes his second hit.

307
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,038
Erinn.

308
00:08:59,121 --> 00:08:59,622
Coach is out of the challenge.

309
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,041
Take a spot on the bench next to

310
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:02,792
Sierra.

311
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,043
Stephen.

312
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:04,710
>> Sorry.

313
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,965
>> It's okay, babe.

314
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,049
>> PROBST: Debbie, you're out of

315
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,384
this challenge, but Debbie got

316
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,009
it right, so, Debbie, take your

317
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,719
last licks.

318
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,846
>> Sorry, Erinn.

319
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,639
>> It's okay.

320
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,139
>> PROBST: Erinn takes her

321
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:17,807
second hit, and with that,

322
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,101
Debbie will take a spot on the

323
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,520
bench, joining Sierra and Coach.

324
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,980
We are now down to four.

325
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,773
Taj and Stephen with all three

326
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,733
hits left on their rope, J.T.

327
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,651
with two left, Erinn with only

328
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,028
one hit left.

329
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,155
Next question: "Who would you

330
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,490
trust with your life?"

331
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,741
>> Oh.

332
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,368
>> This is a gimme.

333
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,036
>> PROBST: Everybody reveal.

334
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,662
>> This is a gimme, my friend.

335
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,747
>> PROBST: Everybody says J.T.

336
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,542
Correct answer is J.T.

337
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,751
Everybody got it right.

338
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,128
>> I don't know why everyone

339
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:47,712
trusts me so much, but in this

340
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,797
game I'm not so trustworthy.

341
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,257
And it seems like people would

342
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,341
catch on to that.

343
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,426
It may be the accent or

344
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,552
something, I don't know.

345
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,721
>> PROBST: Taj, you're up first.

346
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,264
>> Raah!

347
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,598
>> PROBST: J.T. takes his second

348
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,182
hit.

349
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,936
All right, J.T., you're up.

350
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,814
>> Erinn, I'm sorry, baby.

351
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,190
>> Oh!

352
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:08,858
>> PROBST: J.T. takes Erinn out

353
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,110
of this challenge, but Erinn got

354
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:11,736
it right, so Erinn gets one last

355
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:17,158
whack.

356
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,660
That retaliation knocks J.T.

357
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,661
out of the challenge.

358
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,704
Erinn takes a spot on the bench.

359
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,540
We are now down to two people

360
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:25,041
left in this challenge.

361
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,793
Stephen, you're up.

362
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,630
Wow. Some force behind that.

363
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,673
>> Get your butt over here.

364
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,674
>> It's on.

365
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,258
>> PROBST: Taj now down to two

366
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,260
hits left on her rope.

367
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,888
Steven has all three hits left

368
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,889
on his rope.

369
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:40,931
Next question.

370
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:41,891
Who is most likely to stab you

371
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,976
in the back?

372
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,478
>> Mmm.

373
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,062
>> PROBST: That is not an easy

374
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,022
question to answer.

375
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,066
Reveal.

376
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,611
Correct answer is... Sierra.

377
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,737
>> Wow.

378
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,989
>> PROBST: Taj, you're up.

379
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:57,239
(grunting)

380
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,366
>> No!

381
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:58,949
>> PROBST: Stephen takes his

382
00:10:59,033 --> 00:10:59,241
first hit.

383
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,452
Stephen, take your hit.

384
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,828
(Taj gasps)

385
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,288
>> I feel it in my chest,

386
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:04,955
Stephen.

387
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,791
Taj now down to one hit left on

388
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,708
her rope.

389
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,377
If Stephen gets this right,

390
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,212
he wins reward.

391
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,381
Who would you least like to see

392
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,925
win this game?

393
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,010
>> God.

394
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,056
>> Okay.

395
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,183
>> PROBST: Reveal.

396
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,976
Stephen said Sierra.

397
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,812
Taj said Coach.

398
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,897
One of you got it right.

399
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,815
One of you got it wrong.

400
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:31,816
>> Oh, I hate that.

401
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,402
>> The correct answer was not

402
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:34,902
Coach.

403
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,195
The correct answer is Sierra.

404
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,863
Stephen wins this challenge.

405
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,740
Stephen, take your last chop.

406
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,702
And with this, Stephen wins

407
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,370
reward.

408
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,037
>> Yay, Steve-o!

409
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,832
>> Good job, Stephen!

410
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,290
>> PROBST: All right.

411
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,751
Before we get to the reward,

412
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,252
a not-so-pleasant task.

413
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,503
>> I don't want to do this.

414
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,170
>> PROBST: Who are you going to

415
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,171
send to Exile Island?

416
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:54,797
Not only will they not be a part

417
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,965
of the reward, they're not going

418
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,341
back to camp.

419
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,592
They're going by themselves to

420
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,679
Exile, which is no fun at all.

421
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,265
Erinn, I'm really sorry.

422
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,141
>> Okay.

423
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,017
>> PROBST: Erinn, Exile Island

424
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:07,226
again.

425
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,478
Erinn does not look happy.

426
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,813
>> I decided that Erinn should

427
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,523
go to Exile because my alliance

428
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,608
of J.T., Taj, and Erinn wants to

429
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,776
keep Exile under wraps.

430
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,571
We want the four of us to be the

431
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,114
only ones on Exile Island, just

432
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:20,990
in case a new idol pops up.

433
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:21,824
>> PROBST: All right, Stephen.

434
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,784
Choose one person to join you

435
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,286
on this reward.

436
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,538
>> It's got to be Taj.

437
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,874
>> PROBST: Taj going to be

438
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,876
joining Stephen.

439
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:32,918
You guys are going to the

440
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,670
fervadora.

441
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,588
You'll have some nice food,

442
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,881
get away from camp.

443
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,090
One more person can come with

444
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:38,257
you.

445
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,967
>> Stephen.

446
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,677
>> I made a promise to Jet

447
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,511
that I would take him, so I've

448
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,554
got to take him.

449
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,180
>> PROBST: J.T. going on reward

450
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,475
with Taj and Stephen.

451
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,350
>> You're a reward hog.

452
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,518
>> PROBST: All right.

453
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,729
Debbie, Sierra, Coach, I got

454
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,188
nothing for you.

455
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:52,938
Grab your stuff.

456
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,981
Head back to camp.

457
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,983
Stephen, J.T., and Taj,

458
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,485
grab your stuff.

459
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:57,902
Head out.

460
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,611
Have a good time.

461
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:58,986
>> Okay.

462
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,904
>> Good old Stephen won the

463
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,990
reward challenge today and then

464
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,534
he picked Taj and J.T., part of

465
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,578
his original tribe, so now, I'm

466
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,204
afraid that when push comes to

467
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,955
shove, that Stephen and J.T.

468
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,458
will stick with Taj, and I'm at

469
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:32,561
their mercy.

470
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,146
>> Stephen, myself, and Taj

471
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,856
arrive at reward at a Brazilian

472
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,900
farm.

473
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,902
>> Hola.

474
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,154
>> Hola.

475
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:42,446
>> Hey, man.

476
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,447
>> Hey.

477
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,073
>> We were greeted by a father

478
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,659
and son and taken inside their

479
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,620
kitchen.

480
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,705
(kids singing)

481
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,209
>> Hola.

482
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:55,501
>> Come sit.

483
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,380
>> Have a seat.

484
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,422
>> Oh, my.

485
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,006
>> That looks delicious.

486
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,758
>> Oh, wow.

487
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,468
Very quickly, dishes started

488
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,970
getting piled up on the table.

489
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:06,971
There was a stew with some kind

490
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,764
of meat in it.

491
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,890
There were eggs that were the

492
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,891
freshest eggs I might have had

493
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,809
in my life.

494
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,893
There was vegetables, you know,

495
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,687
carrots and beets.

496
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,312
These were all native dishes of

497
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,189
the region, and it turns out the

498
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,067
local cuisine is pretty amazing.

499
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,110
>> Mmm.

500
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,319
>> Very good.

501
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:22,945
Thank you.

502
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,780
(thuds)

503
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:26,991
>> Oh, no.

504
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,035
(crying)

505
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,328
The little three-year-old--

506
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:31,954
she fell off the table and hit

507
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,289
her head.

508
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,206
I just went into mommy mode.

509
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,499
I ran over to her; I picked her

510
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,542
up, and I'm like, "Oh, it's

511
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,293
going to be okay."

512
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:37,918
I had to control my emotions

513
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,004
because looking at her, I saw my

514
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,714
son.

515
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,339
When they told me she was three

516
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:42,923
years old, I'm like,

517
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,008
"This is my baby.

518
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,511
This is my baby."

519
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,766
And I missed him so much at that

520
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,642
point, so when I picked her up,

521
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,644
I just held her tight and I just

522
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,146
imagined her being him.

523
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,147
But she definitely made me

524
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,816
realize how much I miss my

525
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,109
family, and I will never go away

526
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,695
this long ever again,

527
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,489
ever, ever, ever.

528
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,074
>> After the meal was over, a

529
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,326
couple of the kids escorted us

530
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,037
down to the fervadora, which

531
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,956
was this local spring.

532
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,836
>> Come on, Steve-o!

533
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,171
It smells kind of weird.

534
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,130
Whoa!

535
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,341
I could see the sand, but

536
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,467
there's no bottom.

537
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,135
Apparently, the water spring is

538
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,095
pushing the sand up, but my feet

539
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:30,554
didn't touch anything.

540
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,056
I was just kind of like a cork.

541
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:32,598
I was just kind of bobbing

542
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,225
there, being pushed up by water.

543
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,353
(laughing)

544
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,612
>> Whoa!

545
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,363
It's pushing my feet out of the

546
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:47,571
water...

547
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,365
>> That's so cool.

548
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,408
(laughing)

549
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,786
>> Let's have a power talk now.

550
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,245
>> I mean, our next move is

551
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,372
obviously Sierra, right?

552
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:56,622
>> Uh-huh.

553
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,956
>> Because Coach is really

554
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,457
secure around all of us.

555
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,209
>> I think so, you know...

556
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,130
Sierra's a strong physical

557
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,840
competitor, you know?

558
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,509
The only reason not to do Sierra

559
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,469
is that she could be on our side

560
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,012
long enough to take out Debbie.

561
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,597
Debbie is shrewd.

562
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,223
Let's not discount Debbie as a

563
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,182
real strategic player.

564
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,060
Sierra's a much more erratic

565
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:18,519
player than Debbie.

566
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,145
I would rather play with someone

567
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,814
whose motivations I can guess,

568
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,650
but right now is a good

569
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,567
opportunity to get rid of

570
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,111
Debbie, so it's something that

571
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,278
the four of us can seriously

572
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:28,570
consider.

573
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,155
And, you know, I don't know what

574
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,074
Erinn feel about Debbie.

575
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,992
>> Erinn's with us.

576
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,119
She just feels like none of them

577
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,495
care about her, so why should

578
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,538
she care about them?

579
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,624
>> Right.

580
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,472
>> As soon as I got here, I

581
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,432
checked the urn and big

582
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,934
surprise, a new clue to the same

583
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,185
spot where the idol isn't.

584
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,145
We have checked and checked and

585
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,439
checked tree mail and there

586
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,482
isn't one there, so obviously,

587
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,235
the idol is gone.

588
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,571
(thunder rumbles)

589
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,408
Help me, please.

590
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,993
It's hard to be out here when

591
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,035
the rest of my alliance is out

592
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,078
on a reward.

593
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,747
I could not get a fire started

594
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,330
before it started to rain and

595
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,125
that killed me.

596
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,086
I had no food, no water, no

597
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,797
warmth, no way to dry anything,

598
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,716
and I slept in constant pouring

599
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,635
rain.

600
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,431
This is the kind of thing that I

601
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,599
think could break a person

602
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,224
down.

603
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,852
Like, I really didn't think I

604
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,478
was tough enough to do this part

605
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,312
of it.

606
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,148
I am about as girly and prissy

607
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,191
as they come.

608
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,068
So, in my own personal tally of

609
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,612
things that I've done in my

610
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,654
life that I never thought I

611
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,698
would overcome, this is going to

612
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,534
be at the top of the list.

613
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,717
>> She may be mad enough now

614
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,553
that they've sent her to Exile.

615
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,763
Sierra, you would go with

616
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,388
whatever Coach decided, wouldn't

617
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,516
you?

618
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,850
>> I don't know right now.

619
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,226
>> Okay.

620
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,977
>> I thought you said you were

621
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,479
going to be loyal.

622
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,522
>> Then you wrote my name down

623
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,981
last night and you didn't save

624
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,650
me like I asked you to and they

625
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,234
did.

626
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:30,859
>> So, that's how it's going to

627
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,610
be?

628
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,945
You're next then, baby.

629
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,279
So, I'm going to ask you this

630
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:34,613
again, Sierra.

631
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,197
>> I don't have an answer.

632
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,198
>> No, I'm asking you this right

633
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,699
now.

634
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,784
Where's your loyalty right now?

635
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,368
If it's not with Deb and I...

636
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,870
>> I said I don't have an...

637
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,621
Right now, I'm standing on my

638
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,372
own.

639
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:43,997
>> Well, Coach and I know where

640
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,290
we are and so...

641
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,584
>> You guys are in some big

642
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,961
trouble right now.

643
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,879
You guys have two people.

644
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,922
>> Who?

645
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:52,965
>> You two.

646
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:53,924
>> You don't know who we have.

647
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,968
You have no idea who we have.

648
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,178
>> Okay, so it's J.T., Stephen,

649
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,429
Taj.

650
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,931
They're connected.

651
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,015
They're not going anywhere,

652
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:02,975
okay?

653
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,977
Erinn voted for Tyson last time

654
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,519
without telling you guys.

655
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,271
>> Sierra, you don't need to put

656
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:07,896
threats in our head that we're

657
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,772
in trouble.

658
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,398
>> I'm not giving you threats.

659
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,358
I'm giving you the facts.

660
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,359
>> Fine!

661
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,027
The facts in your brain.

662
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,071
We have all lived a life of hell

663
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,239
for 28 days and I'm not doing it

664
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,533
with you today.

665
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,951
So I'm done.

666
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:21,660
I'm done.

667
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,744
>> They... he asked me.

668
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,704
>> I'm done talking about it,

669
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,580
Sierra, with you.

670
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,581
>> I didn't even bring it up.

671
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,541
>> It is over with me today.

672
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,919
Period.

673
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,671
>> Coach and Debbie came to me

674
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,881
and they were like, "We need to

675
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,048
get our alliance back," and I

676
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:35,674
was like, "Last night, you guys

677
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,092
voted for me."

678
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,135
Like, "What makes you think I'm

679
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,011
just going to jump right back

680
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:39,344
in?"

681
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,345
And they freaked out.

682
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,847
Jalapao's brilliant.

683
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,432
They used me to get to Tyson.

684
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,350
So, someone's playing their game

685
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,019
right and I think I'd rather go

686
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,062
with the smart people.

687
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:50,606
>> I know.

688
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,273
I can't believe that she, uh...

689
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,151
is that stupid.

690
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,360
>> J.T. said to me, "It's you,

691
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,570
me, Stephen, and Coach in the

692
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,362
end."

693
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,238
>> And do you trust him to say

694
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,573
that?

695
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,574
>> I don't know.

696
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,366
>> You just let me work on J.T.

697
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,785
If he wants him and Stephen and

698
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,328
you and I to be in the final

699
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,496
four, we have nothing to worry

700
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,789
about.

701
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,124
A line was drawn in the sand

702
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:09,708
today.

703
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,459
Sierra has no loyalty in this

704
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,712
game and the old Timbira tribe

705
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,421
is not going to get back

706
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,381
together, so I need to get a

707
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,800
concrete answer from J.T. on who

708
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,135
he wants to be in the final four

709
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,221
and then I'll make my move.

710
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,651
>> This conversation has to be

711
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,319
between you and I.

712
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm laying all my cards out.

713
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,321
>> All right.

714
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,781
>> So, my question to you is

715
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,365
this.

716
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,617
Are you cool with Sierra going

717
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:43,825
next?

718
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,826
>> Yeah.

719
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,702
>> Then Erinn?

720
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,495
>> Yeah.

721
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,663
>> Then Taj?

722
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,830
>> Yeah, okay.

723
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,040
>> And that leaves, you, me,

724
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,750
Stephen, and Debbie.

725
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,877
>> I think that's the way to go.

726
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,046
>> This morning, I had all these

727
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,589
things churning in my mind from

728
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:57,923
the other day.

729
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,300
I'm worried about how J.T. and

730
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,344
Stephen blindsided Tyson, so I

731
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,137
really wanted to talk to J.T.

732
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:04,680
So that just reconfirmed the

733
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,848
next vote, Sierra will be the

734
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,391
one to go.

735
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,476
Sierra said something about,

736
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,352
"Let's talk about getting

737
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,478
Timbira back."

738
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,147
And I said, "That's not going to

739
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:14,815
happen."

740
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,733
I don't want to get in bed with

741
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,317
a snake.

742
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:17,901
She's going to do whatever it

743
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,319
takes to get her farthest in the

744
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,905
game without any honor.

745
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,783
I don't trust Sierra, and the

746
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,034
sooner she's gone, I think, the

747
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,410
better.

748
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,537
J.T. was very receptive, and I

749
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,207
trust J.T., so all in all,

750
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,292
a very good day's work.

751
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,554
And I'm like, I'm gonna play

752
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,473
like, for me right now, and they

753
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,436
both went bananas.

754
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,770
>> So, Coach approached you, you

755
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,396
wanna...

756
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,647
>> They both came back.

757
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,065
They both came back and...

758
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:57,899
>> They were freaking out.

759
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,525
>> Yeah.

760
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,485
>> Sierra came to me and said

761
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,778
that both Coach and Debbie

762
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,780
explored the possibility of a

763
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,407
renewed Timbira alliance.

764
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,825
And my immediate thought was

765
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,868
complete panic.

766
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,411
I am very scared of a Timbira

767
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,079
resurgence.

768
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,581
Ultimately, we know that we're

769
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,373
gonna have to betray Debbie and

770
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,293
Coach, and to do that, we need

771
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,377
them on our side.

772
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,587
I would like to include you, you

773
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,588
know, but like, you could be

774
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,797
playing me right now.

775
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,715
>> Okay.

776
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,216
Like, look at me.

777
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,301
I don't want to play any more

778
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:24,509
games.

779
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,887
I'm, honestly, at this point

780
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,596
right now, the least of anyone

781
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,513
to worry.

782
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,098
>> All right.

783
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,224
Let's, let's head back so they

784
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,225
don't think we're talking too

785
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,478
much strategy.

786
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,150
>> There's the man!

787
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:40,692
Stephen, I love you, man.

788
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,569
Come have a seat.

789
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,403
Stephen, no, but...

790
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,238
>> I was thinking, like, Debbie

791
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:45,864
and Coach are gonna think, like,

792
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,365
well, there goes the Jalapao

793
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,950
members, you know, BFF forever.

794
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,576
I mean, I figured you guys would

795
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,577
come back and be like, "We need

796
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,537
to take those guys out."

797
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,413
>> And you know what?

798
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,039
Of course that's what everybody

799
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,415
talked about, but it didn't come

800
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,708
out of my mouth.

801
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,918
As soon as we got back here,

802
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,252
Debbie and Sierra said, "Do you

803
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,921
guys wanna talk about, you know,

804
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,963
the alliance and everything like

805
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,964
that?"

806
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:03,632
And I thought about it for like

807
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,593
15 seconds, then I said, "I

808
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,095
cannot do that to those guys."

809
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:08,970
There's gonna be no Timbira

810
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,097
alliance.

811
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,639
I don't like it; it makes me

812
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,598
sick to my stomach to think

813
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,433
about it.

814
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:13,975
>> Sierra on board with the

815
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,560
new Timbira alliance?

816
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,520
>> Sierra's on board for

817
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,896
whatever she can do, but, you

818
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,231
know, she's just a half-wit

819
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,108
floating on the breeze, not

820
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,067
really knowing where she's

821
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,319
going.

822
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,403
>> According to Sierra, Coach

823
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,029
and Debbie are plotting against

824
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,615
me and J.T., and Coach is saying

825
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,616
that Sierra can't be trusted

826
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,785
right now.

827
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,912
So, I can't get a real sense of

828
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:34,496
who is telling the truth,

829
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,414
which makes me suspicious of the

830
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,457
three of them.

831
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,501
Sierra told me that Coach and

832
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,710
Debbie said, "This is our only

833
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:40,961
chance.

834
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,587
We got the numbers now."

835
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,551
>> ...getting the old Timbira

836
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,885
back together.

837
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,345
>> I just, I don't know, man.

838
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,763
I don't know.

839
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,848
>> There's a lot of stories

840
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,473
being told, a lot of paranoia

841
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,641
setting in.

842
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,768
I don't know what's going on.

843
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,395
I've got a lot to think about

844
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,688
now.

845
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,525
>> Well, he may just be like one

846
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,860
pathological liar.

847
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,028
>> If he lies to me, all bets

848
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,282
are off.

849
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,909
>> That's what I'm saying.

850
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,952
>> I think she's loyal to us.

851
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,830
>> I know.

852
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,040
>> Eventually.

853
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,126
Me too.

854
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:37,017
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

855
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,059
I'll now bring in Erinn,

856
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,647
returning from Exile Island.

857
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,442
>> Love ya, Erinn!

858
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,526
Oh, I'm so sorry.

859
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,694
>> You okay?

860
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,487
>> Yeah, yeah.

861
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,155
>> Here's a sweater.

862
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:50,655
Put it on.

863
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,573
>> Oh, my God, that's awesome!

864
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,490
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

865
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,617
to today's immunity challenge?

866
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:53,867
>> Yeah.

867
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,285
>> PROBST: All right, Debbie,

868
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,203
first things first.

869
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,872
Give up the necklace.

870
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,960
Once again, immunity is back up

871
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,962
for grabs.

872
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,047
For today's challenge, you will

873
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,257
each toss a grappling hook

874
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,967
attempting to retrieve a bag.

875
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,510
The first three people to

876
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,304
retrieve all three bags move on

877
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:14,763
to the final round.

878
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,932
For the final round, you must

879
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,017
navigate a ball through a table

880
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,851
maze.

881
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,685
The ball falls in a hole, start

882
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,770
over.

883
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,855
First person to get their ball

884
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,523
into the finish net wins

885
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,484
immunity, guaranteed a

886
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,070
one-in-six shot at winning this

887
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,071
game and the million dollars

888
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:31,905
that goes with it.

889
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,156
Make sense?

890
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,118
We'll get started.

891
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:37,702
All right, first three to get

892
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,704
all three bags move on to the

893
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,289
final round.

894
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,541
Survivors ready?

895
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,045
Go!

896
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,215
Coach misses his bag.

897
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:54,052
Sierra just misses hers.

898
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:54,761
Debbie with a nice toss.

899
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,013
That one might work if she can

900
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,807
get it over.

901
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,309
Just misses.

902
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,857
J.T. snags his first bag.

903
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:08,817
>> Ooh!

904
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,901
>> PROBST: Taj now with her

905
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:10,944
first bag.

906
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:11,611
>> Debbie and her first bag!

907
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,530
>> PROBST: Debbie with her first

908
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,489
bag!

909
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,367
(chuckles)

910
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,912
Stephen has one bag.

911
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,874
Coach snags his first bag.

912
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,792
Sierra's now on the board.

913
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,420
Erinn, the only person without a

914
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:28,795
bag yet.

915
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,547
>> I haven't eaten in three

916
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,965
days!

917
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,008
>> PROBST: Coach now with his

918
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,302
second bag.

919
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,431
J.T. with a good toss.

920
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,891
Can he turn that into a snag?

921
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,809
Gonna have to get far left...

922
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,685
and he does!

923
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,396
J.T. now with his second bag.

924
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,941
He and Coach are neck and neck.

925
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,735
Coach and J.T. each need one

926
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,904
more bag to move on.

927
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,865
Coach has his final bag!

928
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,743
J.T. has his final bag!

929
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,536
Coach and J.T. moving on to the

930
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,122
next round.

931
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,750
Erinn has her first bag.

932
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,793
Everybody even with one bag

933
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,045
each.

934
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,340
There is one spot left.

935
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,633
Debbie with a nice toss.

936
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,843
Debbie snags her second bag.

937
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,970
Debbie needs one bag.

938
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,806
Everybody else needs two bags.

939
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,476
>> Oh!

940
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:24,684
>> Ah!

941
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,603
Come on!

942
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,228
>> PROBST: Sierra with a nice

943
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,813
toss.

944
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,732
Just misses.

945
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,818
>> (chuckles): I got a knot.

946
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,531
>> PROBST: Sierra struggling

947
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,868
with this challenge.

948
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,244
Stephen with a nice toss.

949
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,330
He's got his second bag.

950
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:45,955
Debbie and Stephen each have one

951
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,335
more bag to go.

952
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,836
Stephen with a nice toss.

953
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,755
Can he turn this into a snag?

954
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,384
(Debbie screaming)

955
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,802
>> PROBST: Debbie nails it!

956
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,095
First one to get their bag

957
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:00,720
across the line moves on.

958
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,849
>> No!

959
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,309
>> PROBST: Debbie, Coach, J.T.,

960
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,146
moving on to the final round!

961
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,773
>> This is gonna be fun.

962
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,649
>> PROBST: All right, final

963
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,233
round.

964
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,110
J.T., Coach, Debbie, survivors

965
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,195
ready?

966
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,116
Go.

967
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,200
Very simple task.

968
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,410
Get the ball from the start to

969
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,577
the finish.

970
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,246
First person to finish wins

971
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,540
immunity.

972
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,879
J.T. off to a quick start.

973
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,965
Coach right behind him.

974
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,803
J.T.'s gotta start again.

975
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,805
Coach now with a decent-sized

976
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,015
lead.

977
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,726
Coach being very cautious.

978
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,232
Debbie going backwards.

979
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,861
>> Jeff!

980
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:58,486
>> PROBST: That is my fault, I

981
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,531
know.

982
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,074
That cautious approach starting

983
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,076
to pay off for Coach.

984
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,244
J.T.'s starting to come on

985
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,329
strong now.

986
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,004
Debbie right in there.

987
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,549
Debbie starting over again.

988
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,133
J.T. right around the corner

989
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,969
from Coach now.

990
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,642
J.T. taking a little risk.

991
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,185
And with a big move, J.T.

992
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,103
catches Coach.

993
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,443
J.T. with another nice move,

994
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,528
passes Coach.

995
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,575
>> Oh!

996
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,203
>> You better believe it, baby!

997
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,621
Dragonslayer!

998
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,831
>> PROBST: Coach wins immunity!

999
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,874
>> Good job!

1000
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,958
>> Good job, Coach.

1001
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,836
>> PROBST: Coach, come on over.

1002
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,421
You're on the board.

1003
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,758
>> Yeah, finally.

1004
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,009
>> PROBST: Coach is safe tonight

1005
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,844
at Tribal Council after 30

1006
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,013
days out here.

1007
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,765
One of you going home tonight.

1008
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,140
Grab your stuff.

1009
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,683
Head back to camp.

1010
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,226
I will see you at Tribal.

1011
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,727
Congratulations.

1012
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,481
>> Thank you. Thank you.

1013
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,982
>> It sucked to watch Coach win

1014
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,108
today.

1015
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,693
At this point, it's probably

1016
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,778
Debbie or me going home.

1017
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,403
So, I'm gonna do everything I

1018
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,280
can to get them to go after

1019
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,783
Debbie.

1020
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,423
>> That was a good win today.

1021
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,841
I was proud for you.

1022
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,386
I was proud for you.

1023
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:50,223
Yeah, yeah.

1024
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,182
Yeah.

1025
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,016
>> You know, the mental

1026
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,350
concentration.

1027
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,518
>> Yeah.

1028
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,143
>> This is the first immunity

1029
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,728
challenge that I have won.

1030
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,397
I feel like it kind of justifies

1031
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,064
my place here.

1032
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,776
The meditation, the prayer, the

1033
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,486
focusing technique, I was able

1034
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,114
to lock it in and win immunity.

1035
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,825
With J.T., Stephen, and Debbie,

1036
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,993
I'm very secure in my place in

1037
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,496
the game, but it is a good

1038
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,998
safety blanket to have.

1039
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,965
>> If you guys are in alliance

1040
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,342
with Coach and Debbie, you need

1041
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,135
to know that they tried to form

1042
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,846
an alliance with me to try to

1043
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,471
get the numbers back to get rid

1044
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,223
of all y'all.

1045
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,016
>> He told me you tried to get

1046
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:33,933
it back together, and he wasn't

1047
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:34,225
gonna do it.

1048
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,436
>> They came to me.

1049
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,604
>> All I have is your word that

1050
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:37,937
he done that.

1051
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,856
>> Well, I swear on the Holy

1052
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,315
Bible that I'm the one

1053
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,234
who's telling the truth.

1054
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,700
Coach?

1055
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,326
I'm gonna let my dirty laundry

1056
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,160
out because, you know, I'm

1057
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,537
gonna go out with a big bang if

1058
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,663
you guys are gonna vote me out

1059
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:55,955
tonight.

1060
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,248
Do you guys want to play dirty?

1061
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,207
>> You're really scrambling,

1062
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,000
aren't you?

1063
00:31:59,083 --> 00:31:59,959
>> You lied, and I want you to

1064
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:00,835
admit it.

1065
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:01,836
>> I have not lied in this game,

1066
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,712
nor will I.

1067
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,880
First of all, does everybody

1068
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:04,714
want to do this?

1069
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,715
Because I don't think everybody

1070
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,800
does.

1071
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,304
>> Lay it on us.

1072
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,264
I'm... I'm just listening.

1073
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,891
>> 'Kay. Yesterday when we came

1074
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,184
back here, Debbie said, "Do you

1075
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,477
guys want to talk about if

1076
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,604
there's a ex-Jalapao alignment,

1077
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,104
right?

1078
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,065
And if we should talk about an

1079
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,776
alignment ourselves."

1080
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,653
And at that point, you got in

1081
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,071
Debbie's face; Debbie started

1082
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,406
crying; and I said, "Sierra, I

1083
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,200
do not want a Timbira alliance,"

1084
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,661
and that's it.

1085
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,037
>> I didn't talk about a Timbira

1086
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,913
alliance.

1087
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,122
You guys both came to me and

1088
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,123
asked me for an alliance.

1089
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,291
>> We did not ask you for an

1090
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:40,541
alliance.

1091
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,293
>> I asked where you stood.

1092
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,461
>> And you said, do you think

1093
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,796
Erinn will be upset enough from

1094
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,255
Exile to bring her on to four to

1095
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,256
get the numbers back.

1096
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,591
Did you or did you guys not say

1097
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,175
that?

1098
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,677
Because I will walk out of this

1099
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,053
game right now if you look me in

1100
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,346
the eye and tell me that you

1101
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,097
didn't say that.

1102
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,847
>> Buh-bye.

1103
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,474
>> You are such a liar!

1104
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,100
>> Sierra, we talked about our

1105
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,018
options in this game.

1106
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,437
When did you become this angry?

1107
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,022
That's not the person that I

1108
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:03,773
know.

1109
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,941
>> And you're not the person I

1110
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,566
know anymore.

1111
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,069
>> Okay, fine, fine, I'm done.

1112
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,575
>> Come on.

1113
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,661
Don't-don't... Come on.

1114
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,290
Sierra went crazy.

1115
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,125
She's pointing at me, calling

1116
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,001
me a liar.

1117
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,795
I am a 46-year-old professional

1118
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,130
woman, and I cannot believe I'm

1119
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,548
in a verbal combat with a

1120
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,133
23-year-old over what I said or

1121
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,135
didn't say.

1122
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,595
Honestly, a lot of it I don't

1123
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,097
even remember, but it wasn't

1124
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,932
gonna change the vote on her,

1125
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:38,975
at least in my mind.

1126
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:39,851
Who knows what'll happen

1127
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,601
tonight?

1128
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,728
You never know at Tribal.

1129
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,645
It could be me.

1130
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,523
Nothing would surprise me.

1131
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,114
>> I think Sierra just caught

1132
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:53,948
Coach in a lie.

1133
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:54,574
>> Yeah.

1134
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,950
>> It sounds like they actually

1135
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:56,951
approached her about "Let's take

1136
00:33:57,034 --> 00:34:00,913
out Jalapao," and she said no.

1137
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,251
>> Yeah.

1138
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:07,712
We definitely have the numbers

1139
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,172
to take out Debbie.

1140
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,215
Sierra did a service to me and

1141
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,384
J.T. by exposing Coach's

1142
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,427
half-truths and Debbie's

1143
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,094
scheming.

1144
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,512
I definitely think Debbie is a

1145
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,347
savvy game player and she wants

1146
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,307
to win.

1147
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,517
She is willing to make devious

1148
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,393
moves.

1149
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,061
So to take her out early

1150
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,147
might not be a bad idea.

1151
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,238
>> Right.

1152
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,865
The problem with keeping Sierra

1153
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,366
is she's causing a lot of drama

1154
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,452
around camp.

1155
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,584
>> Who knows what Sierra will

1156
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:46,751
say?

1157
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,753
Who knows who she'll piss off?

1158
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,047
So sending her home eliminates

1159
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,257
one big, nutty variable.

1160
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,344
I don't know what to do.

1161
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,817
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1162
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,821
the members of our jury.

1163
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,406
Brendan and Tyson, voted out at

1164
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,493
the last Tribal Council.

1165
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,666
So, J.T., only seven people

1166
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,209
left, not a lot of places to

1167
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,293
hide.

1168
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,503
>> Yeah, the game's definitely

1169
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,254
changed, Jeff.

1170
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,755
I mean, used to chitchat and

1171
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,798
have a good time.

1172
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,382
Now, I mean, I'm scared to go

1173
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,174
fishing.

1174
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,218
I'm afraid of what's going on at

1175
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:37,844
camp.

1176
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,929
>> PROBST: Debbie, is that true?

1177
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:40,847
Are you starting to feel the

1178
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,265
pressure of only seven people

1179
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,057
left?

1180
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,432
>> Oh, absolutely.

1181
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,685
Our happy little family is not

1182
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,186
such a happy little family

1183
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,145
anymore.

1184
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,355
And honestly, all this craziness

1185
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,692
going on is a part of this game

1186
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,776
I do not enjoy.

1187
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,318
>> PROBST: Coach, has the

1188
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,612
pressure been ramped up a little

1189
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:56,779
bit?

1190
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,197
>> I think there's been a

1191
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,532
catalyst, so that we're

1192
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,200
definitely reassuring ourselves

1193
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,910
with people that we trust.

1194
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,620
But I'm standing firm in what

1195
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,998
I'm gonna do in this game, and

1196
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,499
I'm not eliminating anybody

1197
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,292
because I'm afraid that they're

1198
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,293
gonna beat me later on in the

1199
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,836
game.

1200
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,879
>> PROBST: Sierra, a beautiful

1201
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,338
eye-roll.

1202
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,840
It went all the way around.

1203
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,716
>> Whoo!

1204
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,675
>> PROBST: What's going on

1205
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:17,925
tonight?

1206
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,636
>> Uh, Coach's profound claim to

1207
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,513
being extremely honest kind of

1208
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,348
got burned and ruined when Coach

1209
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,768
and Debbie were just asking me

1210
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,437
whether I wanted to be

1211
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,064
Timbira-strong again, but I

1212
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,482
basically told them they were

1213
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,610
stuck up ... creek, and I

1214
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,736
wasn't gonna help them.

1215
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,238
And then, Coach decided to go to

1216
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,323
J.T. and tell him that<i> I</i> came to

1217
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,534
<i>him</i> and said these things, so

1218
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,786
I'm happy knowing I just proved

1219
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,163
someone was gonna "change the

1220
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,833
game" in an honest way wrong.

1221
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,459
>> PROBST: Coach, your jaw was

1222
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,461
so tight while Sierra was

1223
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:53,711
talking.

1224
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,463
>> Obviously, my credibility is

1225
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,255
being attacked by one person

1226
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,633
because there's two things that

1227
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,134
I am not, and that is a coward

1228
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:00,843
and a liar.

1229
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,095
And I honestly think that in

1230
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,889
Sierra's warped mind that she

1231
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:05,473
thinks that she's telling the

1232
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,891
truth.

1233
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,225
So she can try to make

1234
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,810
accusations of two things that I

1235
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,854
hold most precious: honesty,

1236
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,689
integrity, and courage.

1237
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,274
However, I forgive Sierra

1238
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,860
because I really felt that verse

1239
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,278
come to me where Stephen says in

1240
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,488
the temple when he's being

1241
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,448
stoned to death and his last

1242
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,866
words are: "God forgive them,

1243
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,492
for they know not what they do."

1244
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,744
I was gonna come here tonight

1245
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,328
and say, "Sierra, I'd like to

1246
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,454
ask your apology."

1247
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,207
Instead, she made enemies of her

1248
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,792
two best friends here by

1249
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,877
continuing to call us out

1250
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,378
in front of our tribe.

1251
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,214
Everybody up here now is sitting

1252
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,423
here saying, "What the hell's

1253
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,132
going on?"

1254
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:40,633
So the catalyst that has

1255
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,593
caused our tribe to distrust

1256
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,095
each other is this girl that's

1257
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,221
sitting in front of me, this

1258
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,098
23-going-on-five today with her

1259
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,891
temper tantrums.

1260
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:49,767
>> PROBST: Taj, you're loving

1261
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:49,976
this.

1262
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,310
>> I absolutely love it.

1263
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,980
I've been hearing it all day,

1264
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,272
and it's, like, I haven't

1265
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,565
watched soap operas in so long,

1266
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,025
so this is really giving me a

1267
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:58,943
boost.

1268
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,444
(laughs)

1269
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,487
>> PROBST: Debbie, let's talk

1270
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,989
about other threats in this

1271
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,364
game.

1272
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,365
You won the last immunity

1273
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,241
challenge.

1274
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,450
You're clearly very popular with

1275
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,618
everybody.

1276
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,453
At what point does that become

1277
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,538
a negative?

1278
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,414
>> I hope that I'm not a threat

1279
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,541
because I'm likeable, but I'm

1280
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,751
still gonna be me, and I truly

1281
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,461
liked everybody sitting here.

1282
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,755
Like, it's gonna start getting

1283
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,258
really hard for me to go up and

1284
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,801
write any of these names down.

1285
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,427
I don't like it.

1286
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,512
>> PROBST: J.T., what's

1287
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,847
important when you consider the

1288
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,764
vote tonight?

1289
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,849
>> You've got to factor in

1290
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:30,558
physical threats; you got to

1291
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,351
think about social threats; and

1292
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,686
you got to start thinking about

1293
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,603
people you want to take to the

1294
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,229
end.

1295
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:35,855
You've got to figure out how to

1296
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,732
get rid of the rest of the

1297
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,357
people without making them mad.

1298
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,526
>> PROBST: And yet, Stephen, you

1299
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,361
can't always vote somebody out

1300
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,988
without making them mad because

1301
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,322
if you start telling everybody

1302
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:45,948
who you're voting out, you open

1303
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,491
a doorway for them to scramble.

1304
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,493
>> You're absolutely right.

1305
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,203
I mean, you absolutely have to

1306
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,289
blindside people sometimes, and

1307
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,707
you know that there will be

1308
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,041
repercussions.

1309
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,417
You know, I'm sure Tyson doesn't

1310
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,668
feel particularly warmly for the

1311
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,045
people who voted against him,

1312
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,421
but you have to balance your own

1313
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,339
personal feelings against your

1314
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,091
ultimate goals in the game, and

1315
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,135
it's a really difficult decision

1316
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,261
to make.

1317
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:07,845
>> PROBST: Okay, it's time to

1318
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,346
get to the vote.

1319
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,930
Coach, you have the immunity

1320
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:10,931
necklace.

1321
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:11,599
As always, you can give it up to

1322
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,768
somebody else or keep it for

1323
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,393
yourself.

1324
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,603
>> At this point, I think I'll

1325
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,104
keep it for myself.

1326

1327

Stephen, you're up.

1329
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:34,622
>> We've said it all.

1330
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,666
There's nothing left to say.

1331

1333
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,793
If anybody has the hidden

1334
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,086
immunity idol and you want to

1335
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,629
play it, now would be the time

1336
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,506
to do so.

1337
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,967
Okay. Once the votes are read,

1338
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,926
the decision is final.

1339
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,427

immediately.

1342
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,766
I'll read the votes.

Will you bring me your torch?
