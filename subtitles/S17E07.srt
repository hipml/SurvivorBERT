>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,045
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,380
The Kota tribe has enjoyed

4
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,756
the benefits of winning a

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,257
staggering nine out of 11

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,677
challenges against the rapidly

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,971
dwindling Fang tribe, but on day

8
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,014
21 both tribes competed for

9
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,016
individual immunity.

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,226
Ace in the water first!

11
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,478
Marcus wins individual immunity!

12
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,271
And both tribes were sent to

13
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,023
Tribal Council.

14
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,775
At the Kota Tribal Council,

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,235
Susie dissed Corinne...

16
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,236
>> I think I'm stronger than

17
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,028
Corinne.

18
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,155
>> PROBST: Corinne not buying

19
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:30,780
that at all.

20
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,865
...and narrowly avoided

21
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:32,824
getting voted out.

22
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:33,450
We're tied, three votes Susie,

23
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,745
three votes Dan, one vote left.

24
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,371
That honor went to Dan.

25
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,292
The tribe has spoken.

26
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,668
At the Fang Tribal Council,

27
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,252
Sugar surprised everyone by

28
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,880
stabbing her closest ally in

29
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,298
the back.

30
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,341
With physical force Ace out of

31
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,635
the game, Fang needs a miracle

32
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,554
to turn things around.

33
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,346
Ten are left.

34
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,267
Who will be voted out tonight?

35
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,064
>> What's so funny?

36
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,483
>> How was that compared to the

37
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,526
other Tribal Councils you had?

38
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,946
>> Uh, the other ones are easy.

39
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,822
(laughter)

40
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,282
That wasn't meant to be funny.

41
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,951
>> No. Yeah, it was tough.

42
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,536
>> Yeah, I mean, I didn't say it

43
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,746
to get people to laugh.

44
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,538
Tonight was not fun.

45
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,539
That was my friend that left.

46
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,499
>> Yeah.

47
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,501
>> You know, think about what I

48
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,169
say before you just instantly

49
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,128
start laughing, 'cause not all

50
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,672
the time I'm trying to be funny.

51
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,383
We voted Dan off tonight.

52
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,469
Uh, the vote was 4-3.

53
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,513
I voted for Susie just in case

54
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,097
Dan had the hidden immunity

55
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,182
idol and could have taken

56
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,517
anybody he wanted out.

57
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,478
He was my friend, but he had to

58
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,854
go.

59
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,355
>> I would like to analyze

60
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,315
what our weaknesses are and

61
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,274
shore 'em up.

62
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,567
Because I personally feel like

63
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,528
the merge is coming in the next

64
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,695
couple days.

65
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,739
>> Well, and the way I look at

66
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,115
it, operation clean sweep;

67
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,283
these six mowing down that four.

68
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,786
You know, this is the heart of

69
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,579
who's left, the six of us.

70
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,789
>> Let's do it.

71
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,331
>> We can make it happen.

72
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,625
>> We can't, like... I mean,

73
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,292
I'm not trying to call you out,

74
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,169
particularly Susie, but like you

75
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,587
can't threaten to vote for

76
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,588
Corinne and not tell somebody

77
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,048
that there is a problem there.

78
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,383
>> Yeah. When you and I had the

79
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,634
conversation and you said I

80
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,677
wasn't helpful around camp,

81
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,803
you know, I understood that.

82
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,096
I'm sensitive to it now.

83
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,514
But what I don't understand is

84
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,849
during Tribal you had, like, a

85
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,641
lot of other gripes.

86
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,851
Prior to going in, Susie told

87
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,434
me that she was gonna vote for

88
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,728
me based on the fact that she

89
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,063
did not think I did enough work

90
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,064
around camp.

91
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:28,606
Well, then we get to Tribal.

92
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,275
Who's the weakest player in the

93
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,276
game?

94
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:31,776
I think Corinne's weaker

95
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,193
than me.

96
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,028
I think I swim better than

97
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,863
Corinne, I think I have

98
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,572
better upper-body strength.

99
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,573
The woman is 47 years old.

100
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,699
What could she possibly have

101
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,700
over me?

102
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,993
Look, I'm not really sure that

103
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,202
you're not going to vote me out

104
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,620
as soon as you get your next

105
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,997
opportunity, and I don't want to

106
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,622
feel that way about somebody who

107
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,165
I'm planning on going to

108
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:46,958
the final six with.

109
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,750
>> I guess what we're

110
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,126
wondering is...

111
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,669
>> Will I sell you out sooner?

112
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,004
Is that what you're asking me?

113
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:51,421
>> Yeah, basically.

114
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,756
>> No. Right now they have me in

115
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,591
their alliance of six.

116
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,009
They may think they have all

117
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,261
the power, but I'm feeling like

118
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,220
my goal is that I have the

119
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,473
power.

120
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,226

>> How gnarly was that, dude?

126
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,258
>> We can make a fire and...

127
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,134
>> That was crazy.

128
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,177
>> Sorry to surprise you like

129
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,136
that.

130
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,637
>> No worries.

131
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,805
>> That was a textbook blindside

132
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,807
to Ace.

133
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,017
So I'm so glad that I stuck to

134
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,602
my promise and didn't vote him

135
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,604
out.

136
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,689
But I'm not gonna corner

137
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,107
myself with any pacts on my

138
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,565
girlfriend again.

139
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,358
Ace told me he had you in his

140
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,359
back pocket, like you guys are

141
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,944
friends, buddy buddy.

142
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:38,987
>> Yeah, that's exactly what he

143
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,654
thought.

144
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,322
>> As far as I know, Ace was

145
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:41,739
totally like your...

146
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,365
>> He was playing you, Matty.

147
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,324
>> Okay, well, he was playing

148
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,159
you.

149
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:45,702
>> I trust Kenny a lot more

150
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,537
than I trust Ace.

151
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,329
And Kenny's completely honest

152
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,540
with me and told me that Ace

153
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,749
has been trying to throw me

154
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,251
under the bus, so I figured I'd

155
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,460
better take him out as soon as

156
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,504
I can.

157
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,380
>> You're gonna be gunning

158
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:57,797
for me now, Crystal.

159
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,298
>> No, she's not.

160
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,133
>> Dude, that is... that's done.

161
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,676
I mean, I'm looking at you in

162
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,677
the whatever light we have,

163
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,720
Matty.

164
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,429
If you want to start from a

165
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,430
clean slate, we can.

166
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,433
>> Don't let anybody else...

167
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,475
>> Yeah, don't let anybody else

168
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,476
get in your head.

169
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,686
>> I'm a little concerned that

170
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,187
Crystal's upset with me,

171
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:13,730
because I voted for Crystal.

172
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,857
I had no options.

173
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,358
I-I couldn't break that promise

174
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,276
to Ace.

175
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,610
I'm just praying for a merge

176
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,237
and I'm praying for this game

177
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,238
to change and if it doesn't,

178
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm in deep trouble.

179
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,997
>> Guys, I have a plan for the

180
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,956
merge tomorrow.

181
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,207
>> I hope there's a merge.

182
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,834
>> We are going to be the final

183
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,210
four, us four right here.

184
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,087
Sugar does have the idol.

185
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,089
>> You guys cannot tell them

186
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,090
that I still have it.

187
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:41,883
>> Yeah, okay.

188
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,967
>> Nobody will know you have

189
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,259
the idol.

190
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,552
>> Cool. We're good.

191
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,595
We're starting over.

192
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,305
>> Hopes are high right now for

193
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,431
the current Fang members, and if

194
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,932
there's going to be a merge,

195
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,226
hopefully we can outwit,

196
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,896
outlast and outplay the current

197
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,231
remaining Kota members so that

198
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,317
we can go as far as possible.

199
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,902
>> You guys are all survivors.

200
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,612
>> Welcome to the game.

201
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,281
(laughs)

202
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,496
(growling)

203
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,499
>> Not only did I go above and

204
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,542
beyond to be extra nice to

205
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,502
Susie, I understood that she

206
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,503
thought I didn't do much

207
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,462
around camp.

208
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,671
Then we got to Tribal and she,

209
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,547
like, whips out all

210
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,340
this other stuff.

211
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,341
I was, like, highly annoyed with

212
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,383
it.

213
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:24,634
>> Uh-oh.

214
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,387
>> Oh... Ooh.

215
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:28,805
Oh, it's a spoon.

216
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,140
After what Susie said at last

217
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,350
night's Tribal, I plan on

218
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,060
burying her as soon as possible,

219
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,062
alive.

220
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,188
I am an extremely vindictive

221
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,189
person, and I will get my

222
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:38,731
revenge.

223
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,191
>> Here they come.

224
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,692
>> Tree mail.

225
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,527
"For a feast that will be

226
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,530
catered and enjoyed under the

227
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,532
sun, it's time to party on the

228
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,035
equator like a beach bash, so

229
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:51,661
have some fun."

230
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,829
>> Wait, there's more.

231
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,830
"Take only your personal

232
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,622
possessions.

233
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,624
All you need awaits

234
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,959
your arrival, a brand-new

235
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,085
tribe, a brand-new game, a

236
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,419
new way of survival."

237
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,462
>> Whoo!

238
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,463
>> Is this my personal

239
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,464
possession?

240
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,882
>> This is mine.

241
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,467
>> We got a beach, and there's

242
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:06,676
food!

243
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,386
>> Tree mail's got "merge"

244
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,303
written all over it.

245
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,347
It's talking about a feast.

246
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,723
It's talking about fun, and most

247
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,891
importantly it's talking about

248
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,893
moving to the beach.

249
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,019
>> We're going to the equator.

250
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:17,687
>> All I want to say is Kota

251
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,022
six, and that's all that needs

252
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,149
to be said on that.

253
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,608
And don't be fooled.

254
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,609
New tribe of the ten of us

255
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,445
remaining, Kota Six to the end,

256
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:38,624
Fang four, good-bye.

257
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,085
>> Oh, wow!

258
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:41,836
>> Oh, my God!

259
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,503
>> Oh, my God!

260
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:42,837
>> Oh, my God!

261
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,339
>> There's mixed nuts!

262
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,717
>> Oh!

263
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,886
>> Hi!

264
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,307
>> My heart was pounding

265
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,808
'cause I couldn't tell you the

266
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,602
feeling that seeing an endless

267
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,228
amount of food.

268
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,939
It was, like, it was so nice.

269
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,357
It was so nice.

270
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,318
It was unforgettable.

271
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,861
It says "Open only after you

272
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,112
have finished enjoying your

273
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,572
feast, as once this box is

274
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,365
opened, the feast is over."

275
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,491
>> We're not opening that until

276
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:12,909
this is depleted.

277
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,453
>> Guys, we're gonna be here

278
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,495
all afternoon.

279
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,666
The meatloaf?

280
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,627
>> I gotta remember to swallow.

281
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,420
>> Stay away from the box.

282
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,755
>> There's a big box that says,

283
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,757
"Do not open until everybody's

284
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,090
done eating."

285
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,674
And I don't know what's in the

286
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,634
box.

287
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,719
I know whatever it is it ends

288
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,097
the fun and it starts the game

289
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,767
play again, and I am going to

290
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,685
prolong that as long as I can.

291
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,646
>> This meatloaf tastes so good!

292
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,564
>> Chow down!

293
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,484
>> Kenny, no need to speak,

294
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,485
just eat, dude.

295
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:47,818
>> Oh, sweet.

296
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,654
>> Does anyone want me to pour

297
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,738
them a glass of white wine?

298
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,031
>> Matty, could you hook me up?

299
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,074
>> I would love red wine.

300
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:53,699
>> There's, like, juice.

301
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,700
>> There's two bottles of wine

302
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,701
right there.

303
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,828
>> Yeah.

304
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,418
>> Oh, my God.

305
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:04,961
>> I saw the hidden immunity

306
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,629
idol note under the table.

307
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,672
And the idol was more

308
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,465
tempting than the food.

309
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,466
>> What's that clue...? Is that

310
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,467
something you guys brought?

311
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,093
>> Yeah, let's see what it says.

312
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,095
>> I was trying to read it to

313
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:14,929
see what it was.

314
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,930
And by then Charlie already

315
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,223
looked over and started reading

316
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:17,640
it, too.

317
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,057
>> Read it out loud.

318
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,142
>> And then, I read it and it

319
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:20,810
said "You can either share it or

320
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,562
keep it to yourself."

321
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,562
And I wanted to keep it to

322
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,355
myself.

323
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,356
>> Put it down until we eat.

324
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,357
Just-just cover it and we'll

325
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,857
read it...

326
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,608
>> I want to eat.

327
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,651
>> Let's live in the moment

328
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,443
right now.

329
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,695
>> And then I was like, "Okay, I

330
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,779
guess my cover is blown."

331
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,239
>> Guys, I feel bad not sharing

332
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,240
this because I saw the whole

333
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:34,699
thing.

334
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,409
So I feel like you guys should

335
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,243
take a look, too.

336
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,160
>> What does it say?

337
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:38,828
>> It's about the immunity idol.

338
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,997
>> Damn it, damn it, there's my

339
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,081
chance to find the hidden

340
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,541
immunity idol for myself, and

341
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,001
Charlie blew it for me.

342
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,669
>> "You have just discovered a

343
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,045
clue to another hidden immunity

344
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:48,796
idol.

345
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,755
You can keep it a secret or

346
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,548
share.

347
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,966
Either way, you must find it

348
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,592
before your day at the beach is

349
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:53,968
over.

350
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,677
On the sand lies a large dead

351
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,179
log cradled in the crook of a

352
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,055
tree.

353
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,557
Beneath the end of the tree's

354
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,850
lowest limb you can dig for

355
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,184
immunity."

356
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:02,768
>> Who wants it? I see it.

357
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,811
>> It's whoever decides to get

358
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,812
up and finish eating.

359
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,813
>> It's right over my right

360
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,898
shoulder.

361
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,945
>> I like that idea. I would...

362
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,322
>> That's a good idea.

363
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,364
>> It occurred to me that if

364
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,782
everyone's gonna act so casual

365
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,658
about not really wanting an

366
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,952
immunity idol that's hidden just

367
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:20,828
a few feet away from the table,

368
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,247
then fine, I'll call all of your

369
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,707
bluffs... and I will force you

370
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,168
to get rid of it.

371
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,753
What do you say we find it and,

372
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,795
as a group, set it sail?

373
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,796
>> Yeah, yeah, set it free.

374
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,756
>> That's a great idea.

375
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,132
>> We don't need no stinkin'

376
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:33,341
idol.

377
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,842
>> Randy caught my drift

378
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,218
immediately and became the

379
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,678
champion of this idea.

380
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,055
>> Anybody opposed to finding

381
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,973
the idol and setting it adrift?

382
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,641
Sending it to the ocean gods?

383
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,642
>> I think that'd be cool.

384
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:43,934
>> Let's go.

385
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,227
>> All right.

386
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,395
>> I'm gonna start off

387
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,480
shirtless-- if we get naked,

388
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,314
then so be it.

389
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,649
I didn't even need to see a

390
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,524
note.

391
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,984
I knew that the weird-shaped

392
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,611
tree on the beach was

393
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,612
significant.

394
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,237
It was, like, pointing into the

395
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,781
sand, and I'm, like, "How

396
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,157
obvious."

397
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,825
>> What about over there?

398
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,786
>> I told you I would in less

399
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,995
than a minute, and it took two

400
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,245
seconds.

401
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:03,871
>> Yeah, Randy!

402
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,123
>> I'm sorry if I'm sounding

403
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,458
arrogant, but it was a joke.

404
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,668
I gave myself 20 seconds.

405
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,544
I think I took seven.

406
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,837
I'm king of Gabon.

407
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,922
>> That's your boasting rights,

408
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,465
my friend.

409
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,341
>> That's right.

410
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,759
>> I'll say it loud and proud.

411
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,219
Congratulations for your quick

412
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:18,886
wit and mind.

413
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,639
>> I found it, and, uh, I don't

414
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,516
want it, and if anybody else

415
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,684
wants it, by all means, take it.

416
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,769
>> You touch that, it's "good

417
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,188
game" for you.

418
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,689
Immunity-- the most important

419
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,649
thing in this game.

420
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,234
But if I were to take it, then

421
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,693
I'd look like a snake.

422
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,236
I can't take that chance.

423
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,571
>> It's the apple in the Garden

424
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,072
of Eden.

425
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,156
>> Yeah, you want the apple,

426
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,534
take it, but... no.

427
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,286
>> You want the apple, Matty.

428
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:44,620
>> Crystal?

429
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,746
>> No, don't touch it, dawg.

430
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,539
>> Don't touch it.

431
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,374
>> I wanted that immunity idol.

432
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,792
I'm not even gonna sit here and

433
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,793
lie.

434
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,586
I wanted that immunity idol,

435
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,630
because that's pretty much your

436
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,841
protection in the game.

437
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,468
>> It was the apple in Eden, and

438
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,179
that idol represented the apple

439
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,681
in Eden, and if you grab that

440
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,932
idol, you are biting into the

441
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:05,933
apple and you'd be exiled from

442
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:06,767
Eden.

443
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,893
>> Matty, you're thinking too

444
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,395
long.

445
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,563
>> I'm not gonna do it.

446
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,147
And nobody wants to be thrown

447
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,816
out of Eden.

448
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,942
(several talking at once)

449
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,111
>> Just to tie it to the...

450
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:17,903
>> You sure?

451
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,196
>> Yeah, 'cause of the sand.

452
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,822
>> All right, guys, all of us to

453
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:27,872
the beach.

454
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:28,873
>> With all due respect to

455
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,458
President Bongo, I am the new

456
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:30,791
king of Gabon.

457
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,544
I'm sorry, but I rule.

458
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,546
This ocean, it's mine.

459
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,590
One last time-- anybody who

460
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,174
wants immunity, it's theirs.

461
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,008
>> Oh, my God.

462
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,968
>> Who wants it?

463
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,928
>> The ocean wants it.

464
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,346
>> The ocean!

465
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,183
All those Fang, Kota members,

466
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,642
they work for me.

467
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,770
I'm king. Cheers.

468
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,820
(whooping)

469
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,655
>> These people are so stupid.

470
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,991
I got ten people to throw an

471
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,578
immunity idol into the ocean.

472
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,037
It's never been done.

473
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,873
It was a perfect way to make the

474
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,209
situation much easier for the

475
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,294
Kota Six to gain control of the

476
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,879
game, because there's no extra

477
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,756
idol floating around to really

478
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,382
screw up any votes.

479
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,926
>> Throwing the immunity idol

480
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,719
out to sea, yeah, it was a

481
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,762
beautiful, lovely thought and

482
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,931
everything, but that is a very

483
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,599
prized possession in this game,

484
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,393
and luckily, I have one.

485
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,102
(laughter)

486
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,646
>> You guys want me to read it?

487
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,272
>> Yeah.

488
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,525
>> Oh, it's open.

489
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,817
>> It says: "Note number one."

490
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,276
>> "Note number one."

491
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,945
>> Here we go.

492
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,988
>> "In this bag, there are ten

493
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,366
numbered stones.

494
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,409
Without looking, each tribe

495
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,537
member will grab a stone.

496
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,955
When you are finished, read

497
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,706
number two."

498
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,374
>> Okay.

499
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:53,707
>> All right.

500
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,000
>> "Note number two."

501
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,253
>> "Congratulations, you have

502
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,754
just divided yourself into two

503
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,756
new tribes."

504
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,382
>> I thought there were gonna be

505
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,133
ten new buffs in the box and

506
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,510
that we were gonna be a merged

507
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,511
tribe.

508
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,679
I just never in a million

509
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,764
years... predicted.

510
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,975
>> "The odd numbers are the new

511
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,726
Fang Tribe.

512
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,228
The even numbers are the new

513
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,688
Kota Tribe."

514
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,398
>> Not again! (chuckles)

515
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,233
Damn! (sighs)

516
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,527
>> "Open the bag, collect your

517
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,153
new buffs, and immediately

518
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,155
return to your respective camps.

519
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,365
The game has changed once

520
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:26,907
again."

521
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,492
>> I knew that was gonna happen.

522
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,952
>> "Enjoy the adventure."

523
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,704
The new Kota Tribe is Bob and

524
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,205
Marcus, Susie, Crystal and

525
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,290
Kenny.

526
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,624
I missed you once, I'll miss

527
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,625
you again.

528
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,918
I'll see you in a day or two.

529
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,670
The new Fang Tribe: myself,

530
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,714
Charlie and Corinne, and then

531
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,215
we've got Matty and Sugar.

532
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
Charlie and Corinne and myself

533
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,510
have a deal, so... we're safe.

534
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,346
Uh, I am worried about Marcus.

535
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,055
I just don't trust Susie.

536
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,183
Susie's crazy and Susie's

537
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,893
stupid, and that's a horrible

538
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:55,728
combination.

539
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,604
>> Are you going?

540
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,230
>> Yeah. See you in a day or

541
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:58,397
two.

542
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,649
>> We actually got lucky, and

543
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,443
there is a majority of the Kota

544
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,695
six in each of the two tribes.

545
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,863
I don't need the immunity idol.

546
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,488
I have great relationships in

547
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,698
this game.

548
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,824
And that's honestly what I'm

549
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:09,491
banking on.

550
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,075
Because I know, at the end of

551
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,119
the day, that no immunity idol

552
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,245
gets me to the finals.

553
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,663
>> Are you here with us, or are

554
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,164
you leaving?

555
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,207
>> I feel like I have a lot more

556
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,792
power right now, because I

557
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,544
really can, if I want to,

558
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,298
swing... with Kenny and Crystal

559
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,966
and take the power away from

560
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,176
Marcus and Bob.

561
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,304
>> I'm still... the enemy.

562
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,722
Even though I have on a yellow

563
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,140
bandana, I don't feel very

564
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,143
hopeful right now as far as me

565
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,061
lasting in this game if I'm

566
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,521
gonna be on the shorter end of

567
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:59,166
the stick.

568
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,003
(indistinct chatter)

569
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:03,379
>> Welcome home.

570
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,797
>> Thank you.

571
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,756
>> Yes. This is it.

572
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,427
>> You ready to do this?

573
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,387
>> Are<i> you</i> ready to do this?

574
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,388
>> I'm ready to do this.

575
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,222
>> It's Kota.

576
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,473
>> 'Cause you know what this

577
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:14,807
means, right?

578
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,434
>> Yeah, this is...

579
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,062
This is us, Bob.

580
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,981
>> Yes. Yes.

581
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:23,565
>> Everybody thought it was

582
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,401
gonna be the merge, but now I'm

583
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,193
Kota.

584
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,277
Over here, all I have is

585
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:27,903
Crystal.

586
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:28,404
I feel like I don't have

587
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,739
numbers, and I feel like, you

588
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,324
know, I might be the next to go,

589
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,617
but hopefully, that's not the

590
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:38,205
case.

591
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,208
>> I know, that's so cool.

592
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,044
>> Yes, he is.

593
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,296
>> One of my best friends from

594
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,132
Atlanta is her cousin.

595
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,383
>> Yeah. 'Cause we were just

596
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,926
talking, and he was just, like,

597
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,302
"Yeah, you may not know this guy

598
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,179
named Kenny. Kenny Cox."

599
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,014
>> And she's, like, "Actually,

600
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:56,515
yeah..."

601
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,641
>> "Yeah, that's my cousin."

602
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,767
(laughs)

603
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,268
>> It's a small world.

604
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,896
>> That's insane.

605
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,064
>> I come to find out that

606
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,608
Crystal is the cousin of one of

607
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,651
my best friends.

608
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,570
It's a really strange situation,

609
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,866
because I feel... a little torn.

610
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,159
I'm in a situation where I have

611
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,536
completely calculated voting her

612
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,328
out.

613
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,539
But, you know, since we changed

614
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,624
tribes, I don't know if that's

615
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,084
still the case.

616
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,377
If you're anything like your

617
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,921
cousin, I mean, then I know...

618
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:28,464
I know you're good people,

619
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,591
and-and I just... I just want to

620
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,717
keep good people around, but...

621
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,926
>> That's, that's how I am.

622
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,136
I think that was Kenny's

623
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,180
concern, too.

624
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,098
>> Crystal is actually a really

625
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:38,348
cool girl.

626
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,559
This is a person I can be

627
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,518
straight-up with.

628
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,103
This is a person I can talk to.

629
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,521
This is me crumpling up my

630
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,315
playbook, throwing it out the

631
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:46,940
window.

632
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,524
>> I'm telling you, this is my

633
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,734
word.

634
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,276
>> Yeah.

635
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,153
>> In the unlikely event we have

636
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,696
to go to Tribal, I'm not writing

637
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,697
your name down.

638
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,448
>> Yeah.

639
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,365
>> I'm not writing Kenny's name

640
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:55,991
down.

641
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:56,617
I'm not writing Bob's name down.

642
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,701
>> Yeah. I'm...

643
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,911
>> I'm telling you that right

644
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,870
now.

645
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,580
Marcus and I now have a link,

646
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,832
and hopefully, I can use that

647
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,501
link to my advantage.

648
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,377
But me telling Marcus that I

649
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,337
won't write his name down,

650
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,672
that's me playing the game.

651
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,382
Because I also told Ace I would

652
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,301
not write his name down, and Ace

653
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:21,058
got blindsided.

654
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,143
(trumpeting)

655
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,151
>> Welcome to Fang, everybody.

656
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,277
>> Thanks.

657
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,278
>> That was a surprise, huh?

658
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,155
>> Oh, my God.

659
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,782
I knew that kind of crap was

660
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,366
gonna happen.

661
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,492
>> Yeah?

662
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,868
>> I didn't want to believe it.

663
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,453
>> The Kota Six, before the

664
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,162
switch-up, decided that we were

665
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,372
all gonna stick together going

666
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,331
into the hypothetical merge.

667
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,458
But now we've been split up into

668
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,544
two tribes...

669
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,382
The Kota Six, luckily, were

670
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,842
up three-two in both of the

671
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,342
tribes.

672
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,385
So we can still execute our plan

673
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,387
and stay together, Kota Six.

674
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,139
So I need to make sure that here

675
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,474
at Fang, Corinne, Randy and I

676
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,017
stick together as the previous

677
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,103
members of the Kota Tribe.

678
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:15,362
>> Oh.

679
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,030
>> It's good to see you, man.

680
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:27,291
>> You, too.

681
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,166
>> It's suicide.

682
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,459
I mean, if she has the idol...

683
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,878
The only thing we can say is we

684
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,920
can tell Matty we're voting for

685
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,754
Sugar, Sugar we're voting for

686
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,881
Matty, and then hope that if she

687
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,840
has the idol, Matty goes.

688
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,465
>> If I were to vote tomorrow, I

689
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,050
would vote for Matty.

690
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,010
He doesn't have a hidden

691
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,136
immunity idol and he's too much

692
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:39,761
of a threat for me in individual

693
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,387
immunity, and he's threatening

694
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,431
to Marcus and Marcus is my

695
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,182
alliance.

696
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,017
So he will go home as soon as we

697
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,893
vote.

698
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,352
>> How do you get along with

699
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,437
Corinne and Charlie?

700
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,271
>> Awesome.

701
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,606
My first gay friend.

702
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
>> What about Corinne?

703
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,399
>> She's-she's cool, too.

704
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,109
>> Randy is a great dude, I love

705
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,277
having him around, but I don't

706
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,279
trust him.

707
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,072
He went to Kota, he found a

708
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,408
home at Kota, and that's his new

709
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,411
family.

710
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,163
I'm not too unpleased that

711
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,539
Ace got voted out, because I

712
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,207
didn't have to do it, I didn't

713
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,000
have to break my promise.

714
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:10,584
>> Uh-huh.

715
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,376
>> But it upset me, because you

716
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,295
just went along with Crystal

717
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,171
like that.

718
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,464
>> I thought I was going along

719
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,673
with Kenny, 'cause Kenny was

720
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,341
being honest with me.

721
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,217
>> No, Kenny didn't trust Ace.

722
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,178
>> Wow...!

723
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,221
>> Y-Y-You...

724
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:22,930
>> I know. I know.

725
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,097
>> Ace was covering you the

726
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:24,681
whole time.

727
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,724
He never was gunning for you.

728
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,516
Ever.

729
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,560
>> Now I believe that.

730
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,686
>> And he might have gunned for

731
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,146
you later, but he wasn't gunning

732
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,690
for you now.

733
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,316
>> I didn't know.

734
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,944
I think Kenny and Crystal duped

735
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:37,945
me.

736
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,488
I feel awful that I got rid of

737
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,989
Ace.

738
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,199
I feel so bad.

739
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,409
I wish I could apologize to Ace.

740
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,411
I think I may have made a big

741
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,498
mistake, and I feel really bad.

742
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,250
I believe you.

743
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,834
Thank you.

744
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,544
We have to, I guess.

745
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,545
>> There's nothing else to do.

746
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,004
It's just you or I.

747
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,047
>> You're right.

748
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,673
>> We have to keep our eyes and

749
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,799
ears open.

750
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,591
So, if I hear that you're going

751
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,008
to be voted out...

752
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:00,342
>> Yeah?

753
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,468
>> You've got to use the idol.

754
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,970
>> I know.

755
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,971
>> If you're gonna hear that I'm

756
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,222
going to get voted out, you

757
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:05,847
gotta tell me so I can try to

758
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,431
maneuver something.

759
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,225
Me and Sugar have each other's

760
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,184
back and she has the idol.

761
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:09,726
So, I think we can help each

762
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,603
other.

763
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,031
>> Were you trying to bring this

764
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:23,323
back?

765
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:23,699
>> Yeah, I have.

766
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,826
I've brought some big logs back.

767
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,077
I just...

768
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,578
I might have to break this up.

769
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,246
Hey, you know what?

770
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,038
It might be easier to pull it

771
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,289
up that way and then take it

772
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,750
out.

773
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,585
>> We have a powerful pact to

774
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,420
get us to the final six without

775
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,464
even batting an eyelash.

776
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,465
The way things divided up is

777
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,009
perfect.

778
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:42,551
>> And theoretically, like,

779
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,343
nothing should change.

780
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,428
Bob gives me a lot of

781
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,722
confidence that he's not going

782
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,056
to budge on the situation.

783
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,766
But Susie always made me a bit

784
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,851
nervous.

785
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,811
I think, given the opportunity,

786
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,437
she would sell me down the

787
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,522
river in a second.

788
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,152
>> We have numbers on both

789
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:00,694
sides, kind of, right now.

790
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,612
Let's say for some reason we

791
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,156
lost.

792
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,741
I can make a decision to go one

793
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,117
way or the other.

794
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,119
>> I am far more paranoid than

795
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:09,661
I have been in this game.

796
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,039
Kenny and Crystal are super

797
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,040
tight and Bob and I are super

798
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,708
tight here and Susie's in the

799
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,084
middle, spinning around in

800
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:16,626
circles, playing dizzy bat.

801
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,712
And where is she going to stop?

802
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,047
I have no idea.

803
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,006
>> We can make it to the top

804
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:21,965
six. That's our goal, right?

805
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:22,466
>> Yeah.

806
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,050
But then, when we're there,

807
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,633
where does that put me, then?

808
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,509
'Cause I am one of the weaker

809
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,053
people. Is that gonna...

810
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,387
Am I always going to be sixth?

811
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,890
Because think about it.

812
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,058
It's one thing to be in the top

813
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:31,975
six, but I need to be in the

814
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,852
top three.

815
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,396
Marcus is basically the king,

816
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,689
but I have the power right now

817
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,523
to just cut his head off.

818
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,817
If I do switch, it's his own

819
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,027
fault because he didn't give me

820
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:52,329
a clear statement.

821
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,372
(snorting)

822
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,887
>> We got mail!

823
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,305
>> I just think...

824
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:10,847
Can you imagine a better...

825
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,308
I mean, three and three?

826
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:13,975
>> It's perfect.

827
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,185
>> My only concern is that that

828
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,603
crazy bitch Susie could flip to

829
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,688
get rid of Bob and Marcus.

830
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,903
>> And that is a "save Marcus"

831
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,279
move more than anything.

832
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,531
And then, then it doesn't really

833
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,200
matter what crazy Susie does.

834
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:30,575
>> Right.

835
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,535
I was very pleased with the

836
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,911
conversation I had with Randy

837
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:33,954
this morning just regarding

838
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,579
Matty, because we need to get

839
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,790
rid of him first if we have to

840
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,582
go to Tribal, and, like, he

841
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,668
totally is on board.

842
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,752
100%.

843
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,671
>> If we have to go, as much as

844
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,548
I'd hate to do it, we'd have to

845
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,549
take out Matty.

846
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,133
>> Yeah.

847
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,592
>> Just because of the idol.

848
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,427
There is a one in a billion

849
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,013
chance that Sugar is, like, a

850
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:52,681
rocket scientist and she's

851
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,473
hiding the idol.

852
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,600
I'd like to see Matty stay

853
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,770
around, but keeping Charlie and

854
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,188
Corinne happy is more important

855
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,648
than keeping Matty happy.

856
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,067
>> Hey, we got mail!

857
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,694
"If you can't keep it up, there

858
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,195
is reason to worry.

859
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,572
You may be the first to join

860
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,573
the jury."

861
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,740
>> If we can't keep it up? Up.

862
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,491
Something in the air.

863
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,450
>> You've seen the challenges

864
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,743
where your wrist is like

865
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,786
strapped to a huge bucket of

866
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,995
water?

867
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,371
>> Oh!

868
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,247
>> At this point in the game,

869
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,748
I'm very concerned about my

870
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,959
time here, and I don't know how

871
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:21,918
much I have left.

872
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,920
Every moment seems to be pretty

873
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,212
valuable.

874
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,630
So today I'm going to give it

875
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,716
my all.

876
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:46,610
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

877
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,111
How you guys doing?

878
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:48,737
>> Great.

879
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,197
>> Good.

880
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,072
>> PROBST: Marcus, are you

881
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:51,823
starting to think maybe you

882
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,408
don't have this game completely

883
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,326
figured out?

884
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,994
>> Uh, yeah, I threw away my

885
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,121
game plan the minute I saw that

886
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,664
box open up and reached in and

887
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,081
pulled a number out.

888
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:00,707
>> PROBST: Corinne, happy with

889
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,001
the new tribe division?

890
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,252
>> You know, I've been Kota for

891
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:04,711
a really long time.

892
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,670
I still feel like Kota.

893
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,088
In fact, we're not calling it

894
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:07,547
"Fang."

895
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,548
We're calling it "Fayng," just

896
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,090
'cause "Fang" has such a bad

897
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,133
connotation.

898
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,176
>> PROBST: Matty, as the only

899
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,929
true remaining Fang member,

900
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:14,679
is it hard to hear Corinne

901
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,723
say, "We don't even say 'Fang'

902
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,600
'cause that's tainted."

903
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,393
>> I'm trapped in the

904
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,062
ghetto, man-- I can't get out of

905
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:22,687
the ghetto, so whatever you want

906
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,688
to call it, I don't care.

907
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,732
"Fang," "Fayng," I just want to

908
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,692
get out of there one day.

909
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,945
(Corinne laughing)

910
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,196
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

911
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,113
to today's challenge?

912
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:32,572
>> Yeah.

913
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,740
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

914
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,617
is back up for grabs.

915
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,577
Today's challenge, very simple

916
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,330
in concept, much more difficult

917
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,373
to execute.

918
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,541
With your arms outstretched,

919
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,876
you will use the tops of your

920
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,420
hands to hold two polls against

921
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,506
an overhead board.

922
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,549
If you lower your arms even

923
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,551
slightly, you'll release the

924
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,719
pressure on the polls, the

925
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,137
polls will drop.

926
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:56,805
When a poll drops, you're out

927
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,639
of the challenge.

928
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,518
The last person left standing

929
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,270
wins immunity for their entire

930
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,646
tribe, keeps the entire tribe

931
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,940
safe from Tribal Council.

932
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,109
To put it another way, the

933
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,944
first tribe to lose all their

934
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,362
members from this challenge

935
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,905
goes to Tribal Council.

936
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,656
Somebody will be voted out.

937
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,533
Make sense?

938
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:16,950
>> Yes.

939
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,368
>> PROBST: Each of you has an

940
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,661
individual station that has

941
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,079
been adjusted based on your

942
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,747
height, so everything is fair.

943
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,832
Take a spot at your station.

944
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,917
We'll get started.

945
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:32,924
Everybody feel good?

946
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,301
>> Yeah.

947
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:34,718
>> PROBST: Okay.

948
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,678
This challenge is officially

949
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:41,474
underway.

950
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,059
And after one second, Crystal

951
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,728
is out.

952
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,063
Last person left in this

953
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,648
challenge wins immunity for

954
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,233
their entire tribe.

955
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,777
You will be a hero.

956
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:57,449
Sugar is out after ten seconds.

957
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,783
This is all about mind over

958
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,409
matter.

959
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,493
It is going to hurt and it's

960
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,871
going to hurt quickly.

961
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,830
24 days you've been out here

962
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,458
living on very little.

963
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,752
Not much sleep.

964
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,756
A lot of mental pressure.

965
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,425
Susie's out of the challenge

966
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,217
for Kota.

967
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,094
Kota now down to three members

968
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,180
left.

969
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,855
Randy's starting to shake a bit.

970
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,610
Randy's out of the challenge,

971
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,652
and Corinne is out of the

972
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,612
challenge.

973
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,113
Two more Fang members drop at

974
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,491
the same time.

975
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,409
Fang now down to two people

976
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,495
left.

977
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,420
Kenny drops the pole.

978
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,046
Kenny is out of the challenge

979
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,464
for Kota.

980
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,508
Very quickly, this is coming

981
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,884
down to a showdown.

982
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,179
Bob and Marcus left for Kota.

983
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,057
Charlie and Matty left for Fang.

984
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,602
Marcus starting to shake a

985
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,186
little bit, going to have to

986
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,188
dig deep, find somewhere else

987
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,024
to go.

988
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,110
Change arm position.

989
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:19,781
Marcus drops the pole.

990
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,741
He's out of the challenge.

991
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,368
Kota down to their last member.

992
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,828
The oldest person in this game,

993
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,913
Bob, fighting to hold on to

994
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,791
Tribal immunity for Kota, while

995
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,835
Matty and Charlie fight for

996
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,129
Fang.

997
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,089
Bob drops his poles, Kota goes

998
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,383
to Tribal Council, somebody

999
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:38,883
going home.

1000
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,927
Charlie struggling to hang on.

1001
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,810
Charlie is out.

1002
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,729
We have a showdown.

1003
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,607
Matty, the last Fang member

1004
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,735
remaining and Bob, the last Kota

1005
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,153
member remaining.

1006
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,822
>> Ain't no thing, Bobby Boy.

1007
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,324
>> PROBST: Do not get foolish.

1008
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,784
Don't lose your concentration.

1009
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,785
Don't start listening to

1010
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,621
anybody, including me.

1011
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,623
All it takes is a moment's

1012
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,792
lapse in your concentration and

1013
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,127
you're out of this challenge.

1014
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,003
That's it.

1015
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,337
(laughs)

1016
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,839
>> PROBST: Block it out.

1017
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,216
>> Matty's going to drop.

1018
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,468
He's going to drop.

1019
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,010
Matty's been shaking for a

1020
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,095
while, Bob, stick it up.

1021
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,388
(Matty laughs)

1022
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,097
>> PROBST: Matty's going

1023
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
to be laughing his way right to

1024
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,183
Tribal Council.

1025
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,142
That pole is right on the

1026
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:29,350
edge.

1027
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,977
Both poles on the edge of the

1028
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,395
board for Matty.

1029
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,021
You need to stop jabbering and

1030
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,023
start concentrating.

1031
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,025
>> You've got this, Bob.

1032
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,777
>> PROBST: Matty has less than

1033
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,405
a quarter of an inch hanging on

1034
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,283
to the edge of that board.

1035
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:45,909
If it slips off, it will fall.

1036
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,036
It's over for Fang.

1037
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,916
Bob hanging in there for Kota.

1038
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,417
Matty fighting.

1039
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,253
That pole is right on the edge.

1040
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,963
>> Hold on, Bob. Hold on, Bob.

1041
00:29:59,047 --> 00:29:59,547
>> PROBST: Trying to work it

1042
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,132
back now.

1043
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,928
Bob hanging in there for Kota.

1044
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,306
Matty flirting with disaster.

1045
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,645
Bob drops his pole!

1046
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,480
Matty wins immunity for the

1047
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,565
Fang tribe.

1048
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:22,737
>> Way to go, man.

1049
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,780
I couldn't do it.

1050
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,823
>> Good job, Bob.

1051
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,241
>> PROBST: Matty,

1052
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:26,574
congratulations.

1053
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,867
Not only do you keep yourself

1054
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,202
safe, you keep your entire

1055
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,203
tribe safe.

1056
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,496
Nice job.

1057
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,373
Matty single-handedly wins

1058
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,040
immunity for the Fang tribe.

1059
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,708
>> PROBST: Grab your stuff.

1060
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,709
Head back to camp.

1061
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,710
>> It's "Fayng."

1062
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,670
>> PROBST: Don't forget your

1063
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,673
tribe flag, Fayng.

1064
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,132
>> It was good to win, but it

1065
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,425
really didn't matter.

1066
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,386
In fact, if we had lost, I'm

1067
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,762
absolutely sure that Matty

1068
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:50,974
would have been going home.

1069
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,433
>> I'm pretty happy with myself

1070
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,977
right now that I, uh, I managed

1071
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,103
to pull that off.

1072
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,729
Now the curiosity is killing me.

1073
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,106
What's going to happen in Kota,

1074
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,691
'cause it's totally up in the

1075
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,900
air.

1076
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,111
>> PROBST: Kota, not such good

1077
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:03,987
news for you.

1078
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,947
Tribal Council tonight where

1079
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,365
one of the five of you will be

1080
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,491
voted out.

1081
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,742
Grab your stuff, head back to

1082
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,868
camp.

1083
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,080
I will see you at Tribal.

1084
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:14,956
>> I would like to see either

1085
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,417
Kenny or Crystal go home.

1086
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,585
The big question for me is can

1087
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,127
I get to the final three by

1088
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,170
trusting Marcus?

1089
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,046
We'll see where this is going

1090
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,297
to get me.

1091
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,006
I've got to get to that top

1092
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,091
three, I have to.

1093
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,904
>> We just got back from our

1094
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,531
first challenge as Kota Part

1095
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,783
Three, and it was a less than

1096
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,909
ideal result.

1097
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:52,493
>> You did awesome.

1098
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,369
>> I really looked up to you.

1099
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,162
>> Yeah.

1100
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:54,954
>> You did really great.

1101
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,913
>> Oh, wow.

1102
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,914
>> I didn't even get one second

1103
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,457
out of it, 'cause it just

1104
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,751
wasn't... it didn't fit right.

1105
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,752
>> Once they tilted it in I'm

1106
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,544
like, damn it.

1107
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,545
>> That was a tough one, for

1108
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,047
sure.

1109
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,423
Unfortunately, either Kenny

1110
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,049
or Crystal is going to have to

1111
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,676
go home tonight.

1112
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,260
I would prefer to have Ken go

1113
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,512
home tonight, just because

1114
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,805
Crystal and I have a reasonably

1115
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:18,811
good relationship at this point.

1116
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,146
Let me tell you what I was

1117
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:20,772
thinking-- and I need you to be

1118
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,440
super honest if you can do it or

1119
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,942
not-- would be, like, I hate to

1120
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,235
say it, but like, if Ken goes

1121
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,489
home tonight then we're good.

1122
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,114
And then that gives us a shoe in

1123
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,241
for who goes next.

1124
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,117
Like, it's obviously going to

1125
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,494
be Susie.

1126
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,120
That's, that's a no-brainer

1127
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,288
for me.

1128
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,623
But the hope is that you're now

1129
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,333
part of the Kota Six, instead of

1130
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,376
Susie. It just...

1131
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,670
>> Well, can you sell 'em on it?

1132
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,171
>> Yeah, because Corinne can't

1133
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,798
stand Susie.

1134
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,091
Randy, you know can't stand

1135
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,051
Susie and frankly, Crystal,

1136
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,344
the benefit of you screwing up

1137
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:55,431
in challenges is that...

1138
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,059
>> Right now, I am batting zero.

1139
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,103
>> I hate to do this.

1140
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,359
>> Marcus and I now have a

1141
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,778
solid relationship, but when you

1142
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,362
start talking about knocking

1143
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,699
off my number-one ally just so

1144
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,950
you can get further in the

1145
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,245
game, I'm not pleased. At all.

1146
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,037
>> I know you told me yesterday

1147
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:18,955
you weren't writing my name

1148
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:19,622
down.

1149
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,373
>> No.

1150
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,290
>> I'm telling you that I'm not

1151
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,291
writing your name down tonight.

1152
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,459
>> Marcus is playing the nice

1153
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,586
guy, but he's a schemer.

1154
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,922
I'm playing nice girl, liar

1155
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,757
and schemer.

1156
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,926
The game is outwit, outlast and

1157
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:32,510
you can't outwit Crystal Cox,

1158
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:37,140
baby.

1159
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,891
>> I'm thinking that the least

1160
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,059
threatening person is Crystal.

1161
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,270
She's not going to beat us.

1162
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,730
I mean, she has not run faster,

1163
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,731
she cannot swim, she can't

1164
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,273
balance.

1165
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,274
She can't even do the hand

1166
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:46,899
thing.

1167
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,942
>> Yeah, she had a hard time

1168
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:48,359
with that.

1169
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,360
>> So, let's minimize our risk

1170
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,695
of somebody getting immunity.

1171
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,238
>> I said we should take

1172
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,948
Crystal out first because she

1173
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:54,782
may do better now that she's

1174
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,491
eating.

1175
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,200
>> Yeah, but you...

1176
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:56,826
>> But then at the same time...

1177
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,452
>> Bob beat her, I beat her...

1178
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,911
Like, she couldn't even hold--

1179
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,538
You beat her. She's atrocious.

1180
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,205
>> Yeah, yeah.

1181
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,915
>> My thought was tonight Ken

1182
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,709
and then hopefully we don't

1183
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,334
have to go for a while but then

1184
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,170
Crystal would be next.

1185
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,255
>> Marcus has a lot of control

1186
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,840
of who should be voted off and

1187
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,883
Bob's just going to follow

1188
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:12,300
whatever he says.

1189
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,219
I feel safer at this point

1190
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,220
to stay with Marcus in which

1191
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,138
way we're going to vote.

1192
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,056
Right now I'm actually putting

1193
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,058
trust in you, and that's huge.

1194
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,602
>> I thought we've been doing

1195
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,478
that for a while at this point.

1196
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,229
>> Yeah, I know.

1197
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,314
And my guarantee is that you

1198
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,857
will help me get there.

1199
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,941
>> Once we get there, let's say

1200
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,526
that you got Matty and Randy

1201
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,360
there.

1202
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,195
>> Then it's just...

1203
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,697
But everybody knows Matty's a

1204
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,032
threat so, Matty's gonna go

1205
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,116
first and then Randy and Bob

1206
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,870
and then Corinne...

1207
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,621
>> I'm good with that.

1208
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,455
>> So, that makes the most

1209
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,122
sense.

1210
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,249
>> Okay.

1211
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,334
>> I feel like I can use Marcus

1212
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,627
to get me at least to the top

1213
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,462
three so I have a chance at one.

1214
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:55,718
That's how I look at it.

1215
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,260
>> Yeah.

1216
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,598
>> Okay.

1217
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,390
>> Okay.

1218
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,352
Susie will either go with us or

1219
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,853
she gets voted off tonight.

1220
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,688
That's... that's...

1221
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,190
What do you mean no?

1222
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,818
What do you mean?

1223
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,318
>> Really?

1224
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,530
>> Yes.

1225
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,449
I can't let them do it.

1226
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,492
>> Marcus told you that he

1227
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,201
wanted to write my name down?

1228
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:24,038
>> Yes.

1229
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:24,622
And I'm not writing your name,

1230
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,290
Kenny.

1231
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,712
>> Kenny being safe tonight is

1232
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,091
riding 100% on Sue.

1233
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,385
Or else Kenny goes home.

1234
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,805
>> Did you clean the fish, Bob?

1235
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,264
>> What's that?

1236
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,306
>> You clean the fish?

1237
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,307
>> Yeah, I got it all right.

1238
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,351
>> Almost ready to eat.

1239
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,559
>> I don't feel super

1240
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,226
comfortable if I was to vote

1241
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,812
with Crystal and Kenny and

1242
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,355
vote off Marcus.

1243
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,440
'Cause I don't know if Crystal

1244
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,649
and Kenny could help me get to

1245
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:38,654
the top three.

1246
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,740
>> Susie, Susie...

1247
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,076
Okay?

1248
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,827
>> Okay.

1249
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:45,828
I have a huge decision to

1250
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,454
make tonight in which way to go.

1251
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,123
Either Marcus or Bob or I can

1252
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,125
vote with Kenny and Crystal.

1253
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:51,959
I don't know if it's good or

1254
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:52,752
bad.

1255
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,502
I'm confused and I just don't

1256
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:53,711
know.

1257
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,295
I don't know how to feel about

1258
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,422
it right now.

1259
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,507
It's scary and that's the truth.

1260
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,492
>> PROBST: So, Crystal, you and

1261
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,869
Kenny had not spent any time

1262
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,286
with Kota.

1263
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,454
What's it like?

1264
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,498
>> To me, the Kota camp is like

1265
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,417
corporate espionage.

1266
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,835
You wear the suit, but what's

1267
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,545
going on in your head?

1268
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,422
Whereas at Fang, this is the

1269
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,423
projects, I'm eating some rice,

1270
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,342
we're hungry, let's go to war.

1271
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,469
And over there it's like "I wear

1272
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,346
my suit."

1273
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,430
>> PROBST: So, Bob, now that a

1274
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,766
merge maybe isn't around the

1275
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,226
corner, does it change your

1276
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,185
strategy?

1277
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,019
>> Yes.

1278
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,437
Last time I was here one of the

1279
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,480
reasons I made the decision I

1280
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,691
made was I thought a merge was

1281
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,650
imminent.

1282
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,359
I made a mistake.

1283
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,277
>> PROBST: So, you're saying you

1284
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,988
regret your last vote?

1285
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,155
>> Had I known it was going to

1286
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:03,739
go this way, yes, I might have

1287
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,283
done something differently.

1288
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,201
>> PROBST: So, Marcus, is it

1289
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,577
important to keep this tribe

1290
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,162
physically strong to win

1291
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,872
challenges or that I hang on to

1292
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,416
this alliance and hope that a

1293
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,417
merge is coming?

1294
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,334
>> I think it's important to

1295
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,627
keep the tribe physically

1296
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,336
strong and ready for challenges.

1297
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,214
My hope is to keep us as strong

1298
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,340
as we can.

1299
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,550
>> I think that's total bull,

1300
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,385
what he just said in his mouth.

1301
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,428
He's definitely looking for a

1302
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,429
merge around the corner and

1303
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,430
have numbers to take out Fang.

1304
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,473
Is it not a strategy, Marcus,

1305
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,142
to vote out Fang?

1306
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,184
>> You know very well that we

1307
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,394
beat you guys seven times in a

1308
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,521
row and why would we want to

1309
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,439
change any of the people in

1310
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:36,647
there?

1311
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,440
Frankly, I think you're really

1312
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,524
a nice guy and it sucks

1313
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,443
that your frustration is being

1314
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,527
taken out in this direction, you

1315
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,695
know?

1316
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,362
>> But I feel that you are the

1317
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,323
leader of Kota and that you

1318
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,492
are the special Kota guy that

1319
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,702
everybody's listening to to

1320
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,120
vote somebody off.

1321
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,246
>> I'm one of the five opinions

1322
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,622
here and we don't see who we

1323
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,498
vote for until the final vote

1324
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:59,170
is called, so...

1325
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,212
>> PROBST: So, Bob, getting to

1326
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,214
the vote, is it clear-cut?

1327
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,924
>> Uh, yes.

1328
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,551
Yeah.

1329
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,927
>> PROBST: Susie, is this an

1330
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,763
easy decision for you tonight?

1331
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,388
>> I've made my decision and

1332
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:13,976
I'm okay with it.

1333
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,977
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1334
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,020
to get to the vote.

1335
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,105
Marcus, you're up.

1336
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,075
>> Ken, sorry, buddy, it's just

1337
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,160
that it's time.

1338
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,336
>> You are not the Kota god.

1339
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,421
Good-bye.

1340
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,346
>> Sorry, Ken.

1341
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:50,930
However, spilling your guts

1342
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:51,639
tonight makes it a little bit

1343
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,724
easier.

1344
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,816
>> You like comics when the

1345
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,317
little guy takes out the big guy

1346
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,777
or the bully?

1347
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,112
Well, hopefully that happens

1348
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,197
tonight.

1349
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,006
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1350
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,050
votes.

1351
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,310
If anybody has the hidden

1352
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:38,894
immunity idol and you want to

1353
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,521
play it, now would be the time

1354
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,567
to do so.

1355
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,985
Okay, once the votes are read,

1356
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:46,986
the decision is final.

1357
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:47,695
The person voted out will be

1358
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,696
asked to leave the Tribal

1359
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,281
Council area immediately.

1360
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,324
I'll read the votes.

1361
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,493
First vote...

1362
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:58,956
Marcus.

1363
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,875
Kenny.

1364
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,045
One vote Marcus, one vote Kenny.

1365
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,130
Kenny.

1366
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,464
Two votes Kenny, one vote

1367
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:11,260
Marcus.

1368
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,469
Marcus.

1369
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,262
We're tied.

1370
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:13,846
Two votes Marcus, two votes

1371
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,931
Kenny.

1372
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,975
One vote left.

1373
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,021
Ninth person voted out of

1374
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,772
<i>Survivor: Gabon</i> and the first

1375
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,858
member of our jury...

1376
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,360
Marcus.

1377
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,404
You need to bring me your torch.

1378
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,248
Marcus, the tribe has spoken.

1379
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,052
Just when you think you're

1380
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,512
in control of this game,

1381
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,639
blindside.

1382
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,681
Grab your torches, head back

1383
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,891
to camp.

1384
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,600
Good night.

Meet the new Fayng.

>> Just set it forward and drop

1396
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:28,796
it, please.

1397
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,672

1398
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,673

>> PROBST: Same as the old Fang.

1400
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,175
Fayng, one big happy tribe,

1401
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,218
obviously.

1402
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,678
And at Kota, Kenny is the man

1403
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,595
of the house.

1404
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,138
>> Right now I know for a fact

1405
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,224
that I can win this game.

1406
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:46,272
>> I see the future of Kota

1407
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,148
Part Three as being probably a

1408
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,484
very sneaky one.

1409
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:51,527
I mean, talk about corporate

1410
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:51,819
espionage.

1411
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,737
I feel bad for Bob.

1412
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,197
I don't see him necessarily

1413
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:55,823
surviving the next few days.

1414
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,658
You know, obviously the people

1415
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,243
that wrote my name down get to

1416
00:42:59,326 --> 00:42:59,785
see me in the future.
