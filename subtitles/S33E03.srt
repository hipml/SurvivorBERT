1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Previously on Survivor.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,440
At the Gen X tribe, Paul was in charge of an alliance of six.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,240
If I 100% want to be in control, that's where I have to be.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,120
But the elements brought him down.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,840
It was Pete exhaustion, which is now settled.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,840
At the Millennial tribe, Zeke, Adam, Hannah, and Mari wanted to dismantle the power couple.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,280
Biggie and Taylor are super close.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
That's dangerous.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,160
But Michelle had plans of her own.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,960
I might have to pull strings at tribal council to make sure I have the numbers.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,120
At tribal council, Michelle convinced Hannah and the majority of the tribe to vote out

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
Mari.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,520
Mari, the tribe has spoken.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,640
Leaving Zeke and Adam on the outside.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,760
Who will be voted out tonight?

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Dang, dude.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
What a vote.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,600
I've got to say, well played, everybody.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Yeah, that was nice.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Wow.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,080
Taylor, Figgy, hats off to you guys.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,520
No, hats off to Zeke and Adam are like, Taylor, Figgy, well done.

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,920
Like I commend you.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,800
And it's like, it's not just us, buddy.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
There's seven votes.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,160
I don't see the first day that did not feel good.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
No, no.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,160
No, it didn't at all.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Yeah, because it's like random.

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,240
Adam and Zeke know they're at the bottom at this rate if we go back to tribal.

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,560
People that write down Figgy's name go home.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,360
I know you're mad.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm going to try to be an adult about it and not play victim.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,720
Can we just talk tomorrow?

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,080
I just want to say a few things.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,560
I had no intention of doing that, but walking into tribal council.

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,960
Michelle told me at tribal council that they have the numbers and I didn't see the point

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,560
of voting at the bottom of the alliance.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,640
Even walking into tribal, I thought Figgy was going home and then Michelle says, trust

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,960
me, we have the numbers.

41
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,920
And suddenly I couldn't think of anything else.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,640
I did what I felt was best for my game and I had to and it sucked.

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm not looking for you to feel sorry for me, dude.

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
I'm looking for you to like.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Okay.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,880
I just would like to be alone right now.

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Okay.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,240
So you know how like you're totally in control of the game and you're totally excited to

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,760
go to tribal council and then, oh wait, you get totally blindsided?

50
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,000
That's what happened to tribal council tonight.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,160
I don't care if you yell at me or tell me I'm an asshole.

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,040
Hannah, I just don't want to talk to you right now.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Okay.

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Can you just like give me some space?

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm gonna be a six to four vote, dude.

56
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,400
Can you just give me some space right now?

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
That's all he's asking.

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,960
But like, think of me as a tribal.

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I don't want to talk.

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,640
Can you respect that I don't want to talk to you right now?

61
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,400
And just like go up and make rice with everyone else and maybe we'll talk later.

62
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
I just want you to.

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
No, no, look, look, look.

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
He's not saying he doesn't want to talk to you.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,200
I'm not saying I'm not going to consider your argument.

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
He's just saying he doesn't want to talk to you right now.

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
I'm saying I'm upset right now.

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
I'm particularly upset with you.

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,040
And please just like give me a sec to just like breathe.

70
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,160
I know, I know.

71
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm just saying before you breathe, just meditate on this, okay?

72
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
No, Hannah, please.

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,400
He doesn't want to talk to you right now.

74
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Just give me a second.

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,880
He's saying he will talk to you later.

76
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
He doesn't want to talk to you right now.

77
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Just give me a second.

78
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Just, alright.

79
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
It's only during tribal and the votes would have still been...

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Oh my God, Hannah, you're...

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Whatever.

82
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
He's not saying he doesn't want to talk to you.

83
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Okay, fine.

84
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
He just doesn't want to talk right now.

85
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Okay, okay guys.

86
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Okay, you can say I'm the worst person ever.

87
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
He's not saying that.

88
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
He just doesn't want to talk right now.

89
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
What are you like?

90
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
I know that, Adam.

91
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
He needs space, that's it.

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I know that.

93
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
Don't play the victim right now.

94
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm not playing the victim.

95
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,400
Yes, you are.

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm not the victim.

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
He just needs some space.

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,640
Just talk to him later.

99
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,800
Hopefully something can happen with Zeke and Adam.

100
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,500
Hopefully I can repair enough to the point where we can work together.

101
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,200
Or maybe even Adam and Zeke can make a move using me.

102
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,520
I want them to use me.

103
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Use me.

104
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,280
I don't like everyone in this damn majority alliance.

105
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,520
I think we just got to be chill.

106
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm glad we're sitting next to each other though.

107
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,640
Because at least I knew who was the other fool.

108
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,880
That's me, you and me on Dumbass Island.

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,920
It's been my dream since I was nine years old to play this game and have this experience.

110
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,000
And I did not expect my first tribal council to be my first hashtag blindside.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,920
Now I'm going to have to play from the bottom and it's going to take a lot of work to get

112
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,760
back into a position of power.

113
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,400
But I wouldn't count me out.

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:05:14,960
I think I can get back up to the top again.

115
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
Nice.

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:25,760
Isn't that how beautiful that sky is right now?

117
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,000
Red sky at night, sailors delight.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning.

119
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,040
I have faith that things are going to go in our favor.

120
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
I trust God.

121
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,920
I trust God and I pray really hard.

122
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,000
On my tribe right now I have a pretty good handle of what's going on.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,640
And it's definitely me, Ken and Cece on the bottom without question.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,080
If you are next, I'm right after you.

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,880
And I know that.

126
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,680
But I found an idol already.

127
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680
That was on my survivor bucket list.

128
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,480
So there's hope for me.

129
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,440
I am a Gen Xer and I don't think you should ever give up.

130
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
Feels good today.

131
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Not too hot.

132
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,520
Nice little breeze.

133
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,160
I feel like I'm back from the dead, man.

134
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
I feel awesome today.

135
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,080
We want to talk about a guy who's come back from the dead.

136
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,240
I went from flat on my back to I feel like I just got here.

137
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Like it's day one for me.

138
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,040
I'm going to try to get some fish.

139
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
All right.

140
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Don't hurt yourself out there.

141
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
No.

142
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Let us know if you catch something.

143
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
We'll come help.

144
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
We'll take it.

145
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Well, I'm going to bring a stringer.

146
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
OK.

147
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,360
And hopefully no sharks or barracudas try to take it away from me.

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Yep.

149
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
I hear you.

150
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
I'm going to let them have it.

151
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,480
And then we're going to do the victory at sea dance.

152
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
You know, I live in the Florida Keys.

153
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,080
For me to go shoot a nice, you know, yellowtail or something in the Keys is like I'll be back

154
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,240
in a minute and I go get a couple of fish.

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,680
Here it's like we'll have to see if I'm as good as I think I am because I think I'm really

156
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
good.

157
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,680
I hope we get something big.

158
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,000
I need to chow on like an octopus or a shark or something.

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Shark.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How about a tuna?

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The yellowfin tuna.

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why can't we catch that?

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Something we could chomp on for like a week.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,040
We'll get it done.

165
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,680
Boy, that current is strong this morning, buddy.

166
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,240
That's murked up really bad.

167
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,680
I saw a couple of nice big fish in there, but man, you can't get close to them.

168
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Yeah.

169
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,280
But those yellowtails, I'd get up right up to them and in the waves, just pull me right

170
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
back.

171
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Paul comes back.

172
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,880
There's this school of yellowtail, but you can't get them.

173
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,120
They're just, they're too fast.

174
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,960
And I look at these people and it's like, do you not see that time and time again he

175
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,600
says something and doesn't follow through?

176
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,720
Who do you want leading you into battle?

177
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
The current this morning, what my ass?

178
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,040
People talk about, you know, Cece, she's on the outs.

179
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,920
David's terrified of anything physical.

180
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,520
Whoa, he's got corncarnival.

181
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
What about Paul?

182
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,160
Like, what is he currently offering the tribe?

183
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
He's not providing food.

184
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,200
He's not providing shelter.

185
00:07:52,200 --> 00:08:07,480
And I'm baffled that I'm on the bottom.

186
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:22,760
Gather round, gather round.

187
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,520
We've got tree mail.

188
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,760
Call it a summit or call it recon, but call on four to go.

189
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,120
You'll have the orange rock in your hand and you'll represent and return with inside info.

190
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Wow.

191
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Grab it.

192
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Don't look at it.

193
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
So four.

194
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,680
And then we'll reveal all I want.

195
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,080
Adam comes back to camp with tree mail and he has this bag of rocks.

196
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,880
And whoever gets the orange rock will leave camp and go intermingle with the other tribe.

197
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,840
And I think a lot of people don't want to go, but me being a super fan, I want to be

198
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
a part of this twist.

199
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,960
You know, why not work with people from the other side if they're going to help you advance

200
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
in this game.

201
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
One, two, three.

202
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Oh boy.

203
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Oh my gosh.

204
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Wow.

205
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Nice.

206
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Remember your tribe is recon.

207
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Yes.

208
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
So we're losing Will, Jay, and Taylor.

209
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
And Vicki.

210
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:23,960
No, I should be like, I'm the biggest boy in camp.

211
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Yeah.

212
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,560
It's like just glorious of who got to go.

213
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,640
It's me.

214
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
It's Fig.

215
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
It's Will and it's Jay.

216
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I'm just going the top people in my Alliance.

217
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Thank you.

218
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Guys, we got to go.

219
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:50,200
I'm fully excited, honestly, to go on this journey.

220
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,240
I get to feel out the Gen X generation of, oh, we work hard and we do things the right

221
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,480
way and I want to see, okay, what's the right way.

222
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,640
But I really hope Figgy and Tails don't start making out because then we're going to look

223
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,200
like a bunch of idiots.

224
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,080
And then they're really going to have this idea that millennials don't know what we're

225
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:16,480
doing because we're letting a power couple stay in the game.

226
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:26,240
On the boat, the word summit kept popping up in my head.

227
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,180
And for me, that is a meeting of, you know, like when different countries come and they

228
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:40,420
have a G8 summit from the Gen X tribe, it's CC, Dave, Paul, and myself.

229
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm really excited to go do this.

230
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,040
This is the first time that the Gen X and the millennials are going to mix together.

231
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,000
And for my game, making some connections to them is a good thing.

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,960
I want a pizza and beer.

233
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,200
An old attorney once said to me, you have to look at the opposition with clear eyes

234
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,760
and a cold heart.

235
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,840
And that's how I'm trying to view this game.

236
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,480
So my strategy is to keep my mouth shut and just get information.

237
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Oh, peanut butter.

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Broken.

239
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Oh my gosh.

240
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:18,120
Break bread with your rivals, a respite and a temporary truth.

241
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,400
Then take time for some one-on-one more friends you sure could use.

242
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm a huge survivor super fan and being the one selected to go to a summit like this was

243
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
just fantastic.

244
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Cheers, guys.

245
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Cheers.

246
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,920
So far, I'm achieving all of my survivor dreams.

247
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
Who's missing from who went home last night?

248
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Maury.

249
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Maury?

250
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Maury, yeah.

251
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Did she know it was coming?

252
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
No.

253
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
No, she didn't.

254
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
No.

255
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
That happens, right?

256
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
That happens.

257
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,960
So we got any boyfriend, girlfriends on the tribe?

258
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Yeah.

259
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
No.

260
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Anybody hooked up?

261
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Yeah.

262
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Anybody headed that way?

263
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Most of us are old and boring.

264
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm a lead singer in a rock band.

265
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,280
ZZ Top?

266
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
We do some ZZ Top.

267
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
We do a lot of songs.

268
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,600
I'm old if you hadn't noticed.

269
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,200
I play a lot of stuff you guys probably never heard of.

270
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I think the millennials think a guy like me because I'm older and they haven't talked

271
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,760
to parents in a while and to have their dad sitting there that they can talk to, they

272
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,200
really do appreciate it.

273
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,800
I honestly can say Dave is one of the most incredible guys I've ever met.

274
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,280
Oh, Paul, back at you.

275
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,400
I mean, you want to talk about a guy that's brutally honest about everything.

276
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Yeah.

277
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,600
I mean, a bug flies on him and he will scream.

278
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,360
I'm surprised you can't hear it and you can't hear it.

279
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,640
Paul wants an audience.

280
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,480
He's in a rock and roll band and he gets on stage and he doesn't ask the audience what

281
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
they think.

282
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,820
He tells them what he thinks.

283
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,240
That is not a guy I would ever imagine myself aligning with.

284
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,800
Those are the guys that annoy me.

285
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm going right in the agua.

286
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,040
I'm not even slowing down.

287
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,200
Right now, I'm at the bottom with CeCe and Ken.

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,960
So I need to find a way to make new friends among the millennial tribe because once there

289
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,280
is a swap or a merge, I'm going to need their help to get rid of Paul.

290
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
How's Ken doll?

291
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,280
We call him Ken doll because he's like a Barbie doll.

292
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
No, I love Ken.

293
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
He's the opposite of what you think.

294
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
He's the most humblest.

295
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,120
He's totally not the Ken doll, totally opposite.

296
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,280
The boys went in the water and Taylor and I talked to CeCe and David.

297
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,680
We're trying to learn if they're on the outs, if there's any division in their tribe.

298
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,200
Do you have somebody on the bottom or do you guys feel like you're on the bottom?

299
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
We know, we don't think Paul's on the bottom.

300
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Definitely.

301
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Paul's not?

302
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
No.

303
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
No.

304
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
Our tribe, there's like nobody trying to run around for any idols.

305
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Yeah, same here.

306
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Or to be like the boss man.

307
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,560
No, we're not trying to do any of that.

308
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,360
Well, we do got a couple boss men.

309
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
You guys do?

310
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
One.

311
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Definitely Paul.

312
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Paul definitely.

313
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Yeah, he wears it on his sleeve.

314
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
You can tell.

315
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Yeah.

316
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,520
Me and Dave let Taylor and Figgy know that Paul, he's the head person in charge.

317
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
He's the alpha male.

318
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,400
He's the one who's running things in camp.

319
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
So leaving us alone, it was the stupidest decision they could have did.

320
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,960
It may cost them a million dollars.

321
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,000
Hey, if I end up on a swap with you or a merge, let's work together.

322
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Let's do it, dude.

323
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's do it.

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I trust you.

325
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I trust you.

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, dude.

327
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Mike, we're so solid with our group.

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Mike, there's Noah.

329
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,360
I will kick off my tribe if you want me to, okay?

330
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
I swear to God.

331
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,240
I got to have a very, very important 30 second conversation with Taylor.

332
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
And I mean it.

333
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,560
Come a swap, if it's three millennials and two Gen X, I'm getting rid of that other

334
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:37,080
Gen X.

335
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:44,880
Honey, we're home.

336
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
Paul, Chris, myself and Cici came back from the summit.

337
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What was the meeting about?

338
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We met at a real, it was like a real summit.

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,440
We met at a different beach.

340
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,800
And everybody wanted to know how it was, what happened.

341
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I tried to win.

342
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,000
Jay, Taylor, Figgy and Will.

343
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,120
And the thing about talking to Taylor is that I felt like I had a ray of hope that it's

344
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,680
really been, other than finding the idol, it's really been missing for me this entire

345
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
game.

346
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,280
And all the girls want to know about Ken.

347
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Yeah, they did.

348
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
They were asking about Ken.

349
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,600
They said they call you Ken Dow.

350
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,520
I said, no, Ken is the most humblest guy you ever want to meet.

351
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,320
But they call you Ken Dow.

352
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,240
That's a not a fun nickname for him.

353
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
You were called that before?

354
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Half my childhood.

355
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Oh my God, really?

356
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Ken and Barbie.

357
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Where's Barbie?

358
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Ken Dow.

359
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
I never thought about that.

360
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,920
When you're a boy, like the last thing you want to be referred to is a plastic Barbie

361
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,120
with no penis.

362
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,360
So the millennials know me as Ken Dow.

363
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,520
They think of me as the pretty boy and all the things that come along with that.

364
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,240
But I have the strength and body and the strength in mind to make it far in this game.

365
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,480
I'm hungry and I want fish really badly.

366
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm going to go fish a little bit.

367
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,040
The Gen X tribe, I think, would be hurting if they got rid of me as far as the challenges

368
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,360
goes and my work ethic.

369
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
We need food.

370
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,640
We need fish.

371
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,640
And what I say I do, I wind up doing.

372
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,440
90, 90% of the time.

373
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,280
When I say I'm going to do something, I know how to do something.

374
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,440
I do it and it works.

375
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,880
Paul, he's the greatest fisherman, but yet he comes back empty handed.

376
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Put that guy across.

377
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,320
I would never go into a battle with a leader who is incompetent or incapable.

378
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,160
You pick the person who follows through.

379
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,080
You pick the person who does what they say they're going to do.

380
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,800
Coast Guard mister 40 years in the Keys, owning his own boat, fishing charters, all that.

381
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,080
Hasn't brought back anything to us.

382
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Lots of talk.

383
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Right.

384
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,120
He hasn't brought back one fish, has he?

385
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
Not a single one.

386
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,400
I would say you and Sunday probably threw the most humble people here.

387
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,960
And then we have our rock star lead singer.

388
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,760
We have the guy who not only thinks but acts like he's in charge.

389
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,720
Is he out for the tribe or is he out for him?

390
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah, no, I know.

391
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,000
Obviously you feel like you're on the outs and I don't want you to feel that way.

392
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,920
It's just when there's conversations going on, I'm not getting the nod to come.

393
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
And that sucks.

394
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,360
Ken feels like he's on the outs and I totally understand why he feels that way because he's

395
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
not part of the six.

396
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,280
It seems the only person in this camp that's rubbing people the wrong way, it's Paul.

397
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Right.

398
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,600
Ken wants to vote at Paul, but I've committed myself to Chris and Paul and Brett and Sunday

399
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,840
and Lucy, who are my best bet moving forward to day 36.

400
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:48,960
And day 36, I will then get to read the legacy advantage that I found and then utilize that

401
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,200
to my advantage.

402
00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:06,640
I can't wait until you guys, y'all will come and visit me in Nashville and we're going

403
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,400
to have the time of our lives.

404
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,960
That's the truth though.

405
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,680
Strategically, the millennial tribe is moving forward and it's really great for me.

406
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,800
Me and Figs are pretty good at the moment.

407
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
My girl's here.

408
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,360
She's happy and this could be a better position to be in really.

409
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,060
It's just nice to sit out here.

410
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,080
Not even have to worry about what's going on back there.

411
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
We already got rid of one.

412
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
We got rid of it.

413
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Got to get rid of the other two.

414
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Yeah.

415
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
I think Zeke should be the next to go.

416
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
Zeke is going to be next to go.

417
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
He's going to kick our ass up here if we take him.

418
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
It's got to be Zeke.

419
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Yeah.

420
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,400
Ain't nothing to it.

421
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,360
The status quo of the tribe is not a good position for me.

422
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,320
I'm still flabbergasted by that vote because Figgy sucks at survival.

423
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:03,320
You can't make an obvious pair that is strong, good looking, talented in the challenges and

424
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,060
not be a threat in this game.

425
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,560
And so if Figgy goes home, there would be a shift and that's what I need to happen in

426
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,160
order to have some semblance of power here.

427
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:20,480
If you're Taylor and Figgy, who do you credit for saving Figgy's life in that vote?

428
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Michelle, right?

429
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Yeah.

430
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Okay.

431
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,920
If you're Michelle and Jay and you know that Figgy and Taylor credit you for their lives,

432
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,520
you know those two are never going to vote you out.

433
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,700
So to me, that tells me those four are as tight as can be.

434
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,400
If they stick together, they can pick out any of us that they want.

435
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,400
And so all we need to do is vote out Figgy or Taylor and then this crew is back in the

436
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,520
middle in the power position of this tribe.

437
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I see your point.

438
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:57,360
Adam gives me different things to think about even though I'm in the majority.

439
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,200
I still don't like Figgy.

440
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
She's sneaky.

441
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,320
I do not trust her.

442
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,320
But I'm not making any decisions right now.

443
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:12,360
I'm just watching and thinking and my gut will tell me something when the time comes.

444
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Come on in, guys.

445
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:45,160
Gen X, getting your first look at the new Millennium.

446
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,440
Gen X, getting your first look at the new Millennial tribe.

447
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,280
Mari, vote it out at the last tribal council.

448
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
All right.

449
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,440
Shall we get to today's immunity challenge?

450
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Yes.

451
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
First things first.

452
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,600
Thank you, Brett.

453
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,760
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.

454
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,380
For today's challenge, you're going to carry heavy bags over and under an obstacle and

455
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,160
then across a balance beam.

456
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,040
You'll then separate the sandbags from the coconuts and use the sandbags to knock down

457
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,080
large puzzle pieces.

458
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,280
Once all the pieces are on the ground, you'll then race to reassemble the puzzle.

459
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,120
First to get it right wins immunity, safe from the vote.

460
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,560
In addition, you're playing for a reward.

461
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
Want to know what you're playing for?

462
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Yes.

463
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,880
Be nice to have a little comfort.

464
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:46,160
Hammock, blankets, pillows, candles, and two custom survivor lounge chairs.

465
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,640
Losers go to tribal council where somebody will be the third person voted out of this

466
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
game.

467
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Give me a minute to strategize.

468
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,640
We'll get started.

469
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,560
All right.

470
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,880
Here we go.

471
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,120
For immunity and reward.

472
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Bars ready.

473
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Go.

474
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:15,040
First you got to get five people under and over all these obstacles with that bag with

475
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
you.

476
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
That is a heavy bag.

477
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
That's 40 plus pounds.

478
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Up and over.

479
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Go.

480
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Come on.

481
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
You got it, kid.

482
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
Go, go, go.

483
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Great.

484
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Great.

485
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Go, go, go.

486
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Gen X is falling behind.

487
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Come on, Paul.

488
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Come on, Paul.

489
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Come on, Big.

490
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Adam, let's go.

491
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Millennials are there first.

492
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Start up on the balance beam.

493
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Go, Kail.

494
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Yeah, Taylor.

495
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Gen X is there.

496
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Chris is going to take the balance beam first.

497
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Good man, Chris.

498
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Now you've got to get across the beam with the bag.

499
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
The beam is tough enough without 40 pounds.

500
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Good job.

501
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Good.

502
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Take your time, Baba.

503
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Now we are tied.

504
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Go, Zach, go.

505
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
It is now Will and Brett.

506
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Ninja focus.

507
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Take it easy.

508
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Will drops.

509
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Got to go back.

510
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
All right, all right.

511
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Brett's across.

512
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
Go.

513
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
It's Cece now up for Gen X.

514
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Go, guys.

515
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Go.

516
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
If you can, you can do it.

517
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Go, Chris.

518
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Go, Chris.

519
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Go, Chris.

520
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Go, Chris.

521
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Go, Chris.

522
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Go, Chris.

523
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Go, Chris.

524
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Go, Chris.

525
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Go, Chris.

526
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Go, Chris.

527
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Go, Chris.

528
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Go, Chris.

529
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Go, Chris.

530
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
If you can't do it, somebody else from your tribe can.

531
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Taylor, run back.

532
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
It just means they've got to go twice, and you've still got to get across.

533
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Stay calm, Fig.

534
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Stay calm.

535
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
You got it.

536
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Good girl.

537
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Figgy is across.

538
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
You're good.

539
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Here comes Taylor.

540
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
He's now going to take Will's bag.

541
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Will still has to get across, himself.

542
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Cece taking a long time on that beam, which she could just let another tribe member take

543
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,040
which is what the Millennials are doing.

544
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,540
Come on, Cece.

545
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,040
Taylor across again.

546
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Taylor's coming back.

547
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Cece is taking forever.

548
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,040
It's gonna cost her tribe a lot of time.

549
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Michaela now out on the beam.

550
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
You got it, Michaela. Take your time.

551
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Millennials with a big lead right now

552
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
thanks to a great strategy.

553
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
You got this, Michaela.

554
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Jump to it. Jump to it.

555
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Michaela's across.

556
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
You got it, go, Lucy.

557
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Cece finally gets it.

558
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Lucy now on the course.

559
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
You got this, Luz.

560
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Taylor has become a workhorse

561
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,040
with the fifth and final bag for the Millennials.

562
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Millennials have all their bags.

563
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Now they've just got to get their other two players across.

564
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Yeah, Will, stay calm.

565
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Will struggling to stay on it.

566
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Keep going. You're doing great. Go.

567
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Lucy falls. She's got to come back.

568
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Lucy, you still got to get across the beam.

569
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Go, Paul, go, go.

570
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
She has to get across the beam.

571
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Calm down.

572
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Jump, jump.

573
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Yeah.

574
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Will's across.

575
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Adam, the last Millennial to get across.

576
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Let's get Adam.

577
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
There you go, baby.

578
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
That's it, Luz. Take your time.

579
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Yeah, buddy.

580
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Adam.

581
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Let's go.

582
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Adam's across.

583
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Good separating.

584
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Sandbags from coconuts.

585
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Lucy's across.

586
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Here comes Paul with his bag.

587
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Big lead for the Millennials.

588
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
You've got to get your sandbag.

589
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
You've got the corral.

590
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
I'll take your time.

591
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Paul falls.

592
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Yeah.

593
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Go, go, go.

594
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,040
She's spent a lot of time on that beam and lost a lot of time.

595
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Good job.

596
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Chris, he's across.

597
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
You're good.

598
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Keep going.

599
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Paul now going across without a bag.

600
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Let's go, guys.

601
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Let's go.

602
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Going across.

603
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Go, Chris.

604
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Chris with his third bag.

605
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
You got it.

606
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Chris is across.

607
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Start separating Gen X.

608
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Throw it in.

609
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
It's a pop.

610
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Jay's starting to throw now.

611
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
There you go.

612
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Jay is winging it and not getting any love yet.

613
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Jessica, Ken, trying to catch up.

615
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,040
They lost a lot of time getting across the beam.

616
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,040
You've got a rock and fire, dawg.

617
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Big hit by Jay.

618
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Now the puzzle's starting to come apart.

619
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Another piece by Jay.

620
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
We're not out of it at all.

621
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Go.

622
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Gen X has all their bags.

623
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Ken's going to start throwing.

624
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Rock and fire, baby.

625
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
There you go.

626
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Ken knocks out a piece.

627
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
Rock and fire, baby.

628
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Go.

629
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
There you go.

630
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Good boy.

631
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
I got it.

632
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Ken knocks a few more pieces off.

633
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Gen X starting to catch up now.

634
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Come on, baby.

635
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Come on, boy.

636
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
There you go, Jay.

637
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
There you go, Jay.

638
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Another nice hit by Jay.

639
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
And another.

640
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Millennials down to two pieces left.

641
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Dindit and Michelle will take over.

642
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Jay knocks off the last piece for the Millennials.

643
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Get all of them here on the mat.

644
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Ken with another big hit for Gen X.

645
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:21,040
There it is, buddy.

646
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Right there.

647
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Another sweet one.

648
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Zeke and Michelle now going to start solving the puzzle.

649
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Good job.

650
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Gen X is catching up there, closing that gap.

651
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Ken knocks off two more.

652
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Remember the middle.

653
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
E-N-B-S.

654
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
It is Michelle and Zeke trying to make sense of all these pieces.

655
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:38,040
You got middle one, Jay.

656
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
This goes underneath that one, though.

657
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Okay.

658
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
We're still going to need one more though in the middle.

659
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Oh, almost.

660
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Ken's got one left.

661
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
David and Sunday head in.

662
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Ken knocks off the last piece.

663
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
We got this.

664
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
We might have a challenge after all.

665
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Come on, you guys got this.

666
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
It is Michelle and Zeke, Sunday and David, starting the bottom pieces.

667
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
They got it.

668
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
They got it.

669
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
They got it.

670
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
They got it.

671
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
They got it.

672
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
They got it.

673
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
They got it.

674
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
They got it.

675
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
They got it.

676
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
They got it.

677
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
They got it.

678
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
They got it.

679
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Look for the feet, Dave.

680
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Look for the feet.

681
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
You've been staring at this puzzle during the entire challenge.

682
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Now you have to reassemble it.

683
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
On the side.

684
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
On the side.

685
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Millennials still with a lead.

686
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
They've had the lead from the beginning.

687
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
There you go.

688
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Iguana on the left.

689
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
First to solve it wins immunity and reward.

690
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Losers back to tribal council.

691
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
No one's going home tonight.

692
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Zeke, back corner.

693
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Back corner.

694
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Millennials getting a lot of help from the bench.

695
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
That goes on top.

696
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
That goes on top.

697
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
That goes on top.

698
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
That goes on top.

699
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
That goes on top.

700
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
That goes on top.

701
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
That goes on top.

702
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
That goes on top.

703
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
That goes on top.

704
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
That goes on top.

705
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Oh, that's it.

706
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
You're right.

707
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
You're right.

708
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Listen.

709
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Yeah, don't even listen.

710
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
I'm not going to shut up.

711
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
I'm going to mess him up.

712
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Just shut up.

713
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
There you go.

714
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
That's it.

715
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Another piece by Millennials.

716
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Iguana.

717
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Iguana.

718
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Another piece by Gen X.

719
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Yes.

720
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Yes.

721
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Millennials with another piece.

722
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Come on, Dave.

723
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Come on, Sunday.

724
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Yes.

725
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Yes.

726
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Yes.

727
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Do they have it?

728
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Come on, Jeff.

729
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,880
Four!

730
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,700
Yeah!

731
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,540
Woo!

732
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,380
Ah!

733
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,840
Good job, guys.

734
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,920
Just couldn't catch him.

735
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Oh my God, good job.

736
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,760
Woo!

737
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,680
Millennials, congratulations.

738
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,520
Yes!

739
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,360
Woo!

740
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,180
Yeah!

741
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,560
Oh my God.

742
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,880
Nobody going home from the Millennial Tribe.

743
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,880
In addition, nice reward.

744
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,840
Question, Jeff.

745
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
Yes.

746
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,620
Can I switch comfort for fishing gear, please?

747
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,120
Let me go fishing in Fiji.

748
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,560
Please.

749
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,160
Here's the only way this could work.

750
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,000
A, if GenX agreed to it,

751
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,960
and B, if the terms of what the trade were,

752
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,040
because I'm not sure this is enough for fishing gear,

753
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,900
we're all agreed to,

754
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,960
but I'm totally open to having this discussion.

755
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,800
We have sand to sit on, let them be hungry.

756
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,640
What do you think?

757
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,800
Let them be hungry.

758
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,560
It's pretty simple, you can just say no, too.

759
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,400
What about our beans?

760
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,160
They're gonna try to get out.

761
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,440
Sand?

762
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,240
As much as I enjoyed catching octopus and yellowtail

763
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,200
and grouper and everything else,

764
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,800
we as a group decided that they can keep the chairs

765
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,640
in the comfort.

766
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,680
All right, Millennials, grab your reward,

767
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,520
head back to camp.

768
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,340
Thank you.

769
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,180
Enjoy the night off.

770
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,280
All right, let's go.

771
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,880
GenX, they said no.

772
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,680
If they were our parents, they would have said yes,

773
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,360
but we're already beating them,

774
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,800
so they don't wanna make us stronger.

775
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,740
That makes sense.

776
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,680
All right, GenX, somebody from your tribe

777
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,280
will be the third person voted out of this game.

778
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,720
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

779
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,080
See you tonight at tribal.

780
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,760
CC, she wanted that personal victory

781
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,600
of inching across the balance beam.

782
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,720
Three and a half Millennials got across

783
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,840
in that amount of time, and it was the difference maker.

784
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,080
Yeah, tribal council, it's on tonight,

785
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,520
but I'm not sure how CC doesn't go home tonight.

786
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I'm gonna do my...

787
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
I'm gonna do my...

788
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
I'm gonna do my...

789
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
I'm gonna do my...

790
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
I'm gonna do my...

791
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm gonna do my...

792
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
I'm gonna do my...

793
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Oh, that sucks.

794
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
It did suck.

795
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
It sucked.

796
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Good try.

797
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
Big time.

798
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
Everybody's bopped.

799
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,520
So we move forward, right?

800
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
Let's go.

801
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
In my opinion, CC cost us the challenge.

802
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,520
There was no question who was going home after that.

803
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
All right, let's figure out what we're doing

804
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
the rest of our day.

805
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
But it's Survivor, and I've seen it happen before.

806
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
When you get too complacent, things happen.

807
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,520
But I think everybody's on board with voting out CC unanimously.

808
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,520
She can't do the swim challenge.

809
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
She can't do these challenges.

810
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
I mean, enough's enough.

811
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Three and a half out of five people crossed on her.

812
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
I know.

813
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
That's huge.

814
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
Watching it was just like...

815
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
It was painful.

816
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
I mean, let's...

817
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
All right, so we're all agreeants, right?

818
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Who's going home?

819
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Yeah.

820
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
I know.

821
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
When I went to the well with Chris and Brett,

822
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,520
we basically talked about sticking to our alliance of six.

823
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,520
So what we have on the docket for tonight is to vote out CC.

824
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
We gotta keep the team strong.

825
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Absolutely.

826
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
And it sucks.

827
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
It's gotta be hard, but it's gotta be hard.

828
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
It doesn't suck, then.

829
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Well, I know.

830
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
I'm sorry.

831
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Voting CC out to keep the tribe strong is a good thing to do.

832
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,520
She has not done well in challenges.

833
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
I can't argue it at all.

834
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
So it's time.

835
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Yeah.

836
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Do you girls have an idea of what the plan is?

837
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
I have no idea.

838
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I don't know what's going on.

839
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
I'm clueless.

840
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,520
I think the boys are working out the details.

841
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
So...

842
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
Ugh.

843
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm worried about tonight because I had three votes last time.

844
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,520
And, of course, no one ever comes up to me and says,

845
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
hey, let's do this.

846
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
You know, Paul never comes up to me.

847
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,520
Brett, Chris, Sunday, Jessica, and Lucy,

848
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
they never come up to me.

849
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm 100% worried about that.

850
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
I just feel unsafe.

851
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Ken, what do you think about us trying to put a target on Paul?

852
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
This has to happen.

853
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,520
CC, we're already on the bottom.

854
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
I don't think we...

855
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Have anything on Lucy?

856
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Yeah.

857
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
We have to get rid of Paul.

858
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
As soon as Paul goes away,

859
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,520
then some other connections and bonds can start forming.

860
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
I feel optimistic, but...

861
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
There's CC, myself, and Ken on the bottom.

862
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I already retrieved my idol from its hiding spot,

863
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,520
but other people could absolutely take control of the game right now

864
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
if they wanted to and vote off Paul.

865
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
That's all we need.

866
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,520
I wish they could see that there's just no point

867
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,520
in keeping Paul on their side.

868
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,520
It seems too easy not to just hold and stay the course, right?

869
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
So we got the same people in mind, right?

870
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,520
We go CC, and we go right down the line.

871
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Mm-hmm. Yep.

872
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Okay. Yep. Perfect. Yep.

873
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
And we just placate everybody in the meantime.

874
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Of course. Yeah.

875
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,520
And as long as you guys aren't doing a boy's thing...

876
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Oh, no.

877
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Well, this is a solid six point.

878
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,520
And you have my word, if that came up, I would tell you.

879
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,520
If they decided to do that, I would say,

880
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
ladies, you're on your own.

881
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Paul said to me that if the boys came to me

882
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,520
and said they wanted to do an all-boys thing,

883
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
I'd say, good luck, girl.

884
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
And I went, what?

885
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
So at that moment, I knew that he was not...

886
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
He's not with me. He's with boys.

887
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
You're right.

888
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,520
We're on the bottom as far as a six-year-old.

889
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
Yeah.

890
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
It's the boys and then it's the girls.

891
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Well, if we feel like he's the biggest threat right now,

892
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
then we need to get rid of Paul first.

893
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Right.

894
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
I'm comfortable with it.

895
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
If you guys are.

896
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Yeah, I don't know.

897
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
You think Dave would be on board with that?

898
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
We need Ken, Cece and Dave.

899
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Yeah.

900
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I'm sure Cece, Ken and Dave would vote off Paul.

901
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,520
So tonight we have a very big decision to make.

902
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,520
If we determine that voting off Paul

903
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
will be the best thing for our tribe,

904
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,520
I am going to be courting two individuals

905
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
that I've worked with, Brett and Chris.

906
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
You think we're good, right?

907
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Yeah.

908
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Oh, we're good.

909
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
We're on it.

910
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
She's over there too.

911
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Who?

912
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
All the women are on this.

913
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
They're fine.

914
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Oh, God, this is so horrible.

915
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,520
I'm fearful of what will happen if we don't vote off Paul,

916
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:19,520
but I'm fearful of what will happen if we do vote off Paul.

917
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
You don't know me.

918
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:36,520
David, let's talk about the summit.

919
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
Who went from your group?

920
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,520
It was myself, Chris, Paul and Cece.

921
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,520
So you mixed tribes, you meet each other.

922
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
What was your takeaway?

923
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
The thing that did strike me as odd

924
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,520
is that I actually saw the millennials as people and peers.

925
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
There was a mutual respect between all of us,

926
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,520
and I'm feeling like transformed in some way.

927
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Well, what is it that's changed, David,

928
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,520
because you were very nervous at the first tribal,

929
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,520
and you do seem much more calm.

930
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
What's happened?

931
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,520
This experience actually is helping me cope with my anxiety.

932
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,520
So it's not that I feel like I'm any safer in the game right now.

933
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,520
It's actually like tearing down the walls

934
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
and the energy I have for the anxiety.

935
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
So it makes me more calm.

936
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Cece, you were also very nervous.

937
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Turned out, rightly so, you got votes.

938
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Yeah, I got three votes.

939
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
You know, I didn't feel safe in the beginning anyways,

940
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
because it was like no one was talking to me,

941
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
no one was giving me a straight answer,

942
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
and I still feel the same way today.

943
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
I just feel like three people that's at the bottom

944
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
and everyone else is at the top.

945
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Who's at the bottom?

946
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
I feel myself.

947
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
I think Dave and possibly Ken.

948
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
So, Chris, if there's an alliance of six,

949
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,520
how do you navigate keeping everybody together

950
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,520
when there's an opportunity to go with Cece and David and Ken

951
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
and say, let's make something else happen,

952
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
because I think I might be number five?

953
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Way too early to be making those assumptions.

954
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
If you're going to try to stick to an alliance,

955
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
it's very dangerous to start making those assumptions

956
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
who's five and six right now.

957
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
Way too early.

958
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
Let's talk about the challenge today.

959
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
Just generally speaking, Cece,

960
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,520
did you feel good about getting over the balance beam?

961
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
Yeah, absolutely.

962
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
And it was very impressive that you finished.

963
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
It took a long time.

964
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
What you guys didn't see were the Millennials

965
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
who moved across that balance beam quickly

966
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,520
because they cooperated.

967
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Brett, watching you guys, it looked like a lot of individuals.

968
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,520
Yeah, I think there might be some truth to that.

969
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,520
I mean, is it because of pride that we had to...

970
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
could be? I don't know.

971
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Sundae, do you think there's something to that?

972
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,520
Because I was blown away by how efficiently

973
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,520
the Millennials worked together to figure it out.

974
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,520
Right, for Gen Xers, we think of everything

975
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
in terms of it's the right way or the wrong way.

976
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
Where it's not necessarily right or wrong,

977
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
it's just you may get there a different path.

978
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
And I feel like my kids that are Millennials,

979
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,520
they'll give anything a try, they'll try it with anybody,

980
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
and they'll try it 80 different ways.

981
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
I have a question, just curiosity.

982
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Paul, do you text?

983
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
No, a little bit.

984
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Sundae, do you text? Oh, yeah.

985
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,520
When you write the word you, as in see you later,

986
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,520
do you spell Y-O-U or do you use the letter U?

987
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
I spell Y-O-U.

988
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
I spell Y-O-U. Yeah.

989
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Pretty interesting because the Millennials will tell you

990
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,520
the language is changing, and you can change with us

991
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,520
or you can just be an old fogie.

992
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
But it's more efficient.

993
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
There's something about efficiency,

994
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
but there's also something poetic about language,

995
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,520
and language is beautiful.

996
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,520
We lose that foundation of language that we have,

997
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
we lose something really beautiful.

998
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Okay, let's be efficient, but don't lose sight of the past.

999
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,520
But Ken, how far away is that comment from being the guy

1000
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,520
that says, vinyl's the only way to listen to music?

1001
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Gotta tell you.

1002
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,520
There's something about vinyl over digital that I just, I dig.

1003
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
You're asking the wrong guy. I like the texture.

1004
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,520
So, before we go to the vote,

1005
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
what's the level of paranoia right now, Paul?

1006
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,520
I think the level of paranoia within the six is low,

1007
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,520
and I think the level of paranoia for the three is high.

1008
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
But people that are sitting in the six

1009
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,520
made those other moves to get them in that six.

1010
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,520
And I have just as much of a chance

1011
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
to be sitting there as they do.

1012
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,520
I'm sure I'll be sitting there one day,

1013
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
and I won't feel good about it either.

1014
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
But that's why we're here. We're not here to go camping.

1015
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
We're here to play the game.

1016
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Ken, could you feel that level of paranoia as one of the three?

1017
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
I think some people definitely feel more comfortable than others,

1018
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
and there's been chatter,

1019
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
but for me it comes down to my work ethic.

1020
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,520
I want to be an asset, and I feel like it's helping,

1021
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,520
but I could be an idiot.

1022
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Cece, what odds do you give yourself right now?

1023
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
10%.

1024
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Really?

1025
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Jessica, what do you think's gonna be the result of tonight's vote?

1026
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,520
I'm hoping that the result helps this tribe move forward as a tribe.

1027
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
I understand that there's divisions,

1028
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,520
but we also need to focus on winning the next challenge,

1029
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
and that's not gonna take just six of us.

1030
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,520
It's gonna take everyone who's left.

1031
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Okay, it is time to vote.

1032
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Brett, you're up.

1033
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,520
Oh!

1034
00:39:24,520 --> 01:18:47,040
igent

1035
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:03,560
I'll go tally the votes.

1036
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:13,160
If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time

1037
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:25,040
to do so.

1038
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,120
Okay once the votes are read the decision is final.

1039
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,720
Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.

1040
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,320
I'll read the votes.

1041
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
First vote.

1042
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
Paul.

1043
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Cece.

1044
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Paul.

1045
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,760
Cece.

1046
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,040
Paul.

1047
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Two votes Paul, two votes Cece.

1048
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,400
Paul.

1049
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,200
That's three votes Paul.

1050
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Cece.

1051
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
We're tied again.

1052
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,120
Three votes Paul, three votes Cece.

1053
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,360
Paul.

1054
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,880
That's four votes Paul, three votes Cece.

1055
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,120
Paul.

1056
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,600
Third person voted out.

1057
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Paul.

1058
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
That's five, that's enough.

1059
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:21,600
You can bring me your torch.

1060
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:35,720
Paul, the tribe is spoken.

1061
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Time for you to go.

1062
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:45,040
Good luck guys.

1063
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,520
Well whether you're a millennial or a Gen Xer, the blind side is the blind side.

1064
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:59,360
Grab your torches, head back to camp.

1065
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:06,400
Good night.

1066
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,800
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

1067
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Next time on Survivor.

1068
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,840
Tensions are high at the Gen X tribe.

1069
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Don't talk to anybody else.

1070
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,160
We went from one dictator to another.

1071
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,800
But the real battle is against the millennials.

1072
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Their guys are you.

1073
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Kayla now takes her top rock.

1074
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,800
They're about to do some ta-tas today.

1075
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,960
Blindsided 150 percent.

1076
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,840
Apparently somebody played better than I did and I'm still kind of in shock on trying to

1077
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,200
figure out who voted for me and what happened.

1078
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,680
When I got sick it was pretty scary.

1079
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,200
But Survivor has been a great experience for me.

1080
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,520
At 52 years of age I've been through a lot in my life and I would say this rate's up

1081
00:42:50,520 --> 00:43:06,160
there with number one.
