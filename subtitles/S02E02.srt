1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:04,212
>> JEFF: Previously on Survivor:

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,088
Two tribes were abandoned in the
middle of the Australian

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,215
outback...
>> AMBER: Ogakor.

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,717
>> MARALYN: Ogakor.
>> MICHAEL: Kucha.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,802
>> DEBB: We're Kucha?
>> JEFF: ...and had to make a

6
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,262
treacherous hike to find their
camps.

7
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,473
>> AMBER: I'm a little tired.
This rice is very heavy.

8
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,726
>> JEFF: But not everybody could
stomach the trek.

9
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,520
>> JEFF V.: All of a sudden I
just got sort of nauseous, and I

10
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,605
kept thinking to myself, "I'm
not going to get sick."

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,650
( retching )
>> JEFF: At Ogakor, tensions

12
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,943
simmered between Keith and
Jerri.

13
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,154
>> JERRI: I don't even really
want to attempt to start a fire

14
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,072
until we get it where we want to
keep it.

15
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,615
>> KEITH: I think we start the
fire-- we take it where we want

16
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,576
to.
>> JERRI: He might very well not

17
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,286
even be aware of some of the
condescending remarks he made to

18
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,414
me, but I'm not the kind of
person to just let it slide off

19
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,500
my back.
>> JEFF: At Kucha, there wasn't

20
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,294
enough food to put in their
mouths...

21
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,297
>> JEFF V.: I'm looking at bugs.
>> JEFF: ...but there was plenty

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,299
of Kimmi's mouth to go around.
>> KIMMI: We was back-to-back,

23
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,176
he farted in my... it
rebounded...

24
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,261
>> JEFF V.: Kimmi will not shut
up.

25
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,264
I just want to grab her by the
neck and shake the ... out of

26
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,850
her.
>> JEFF: Ogakor won the immunity

27
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,268
challenge...
The immunity idol.

28
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,522
...so Kucha had to make the long
hike to Tribal Council.

29
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,983
Debb was the first person voted
out.

30
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,611
The tribe has spoken.
15 People left.

31
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:19,662
Who will be voted out tonight?
>> JEFF V.: I saw Mike getting

32
00:01:19,746 --> 00:02:35,572
Who will be voted out tonight?
>> JEFF V.: I saw Mike getting

33
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,950
up really early.
The sun was just coming up.

34
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,619
Everybody was asleep, and I woke
up, and I saw Mike messing

35
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,622
around the fire and putting
stuff on the pot, and I couldn't

36
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:49,377
understand what he was doing.
And so as we were waking up, we

37
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,091
realized he put rice on, and
nobody said anything about

38
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,969
eating rice.
Nobody said they were hungry.

39
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,555
And he left.
He just put the rice on, and he

40
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,557
left.
>> ALICIA: Are you making rice?

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,309
>> JEFF V.: Mike is.
>> ALICIA: Mike's making rice

42
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,270
already?
>> JEFF V.: I hope everybody's

43
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,566
hungry.
I'm not hungry at all.

44
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,567
That was totally not cool.
>> ALICIA: No, I don't think

45
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,277
that was good.
When it comes to food, it has to

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,280
be a group decision, since we
don't have much.

47
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,575
Mike was hungry.
That's why he did that.

48
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,411
And that is another indication
of Mike being Mike, about

49
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,915
himself.
>> MICHAEL: Everyday we've been

50
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,667
having breakfast first thing in
the morning, and I got up, and I

51
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,502
thought I was being really
helpful, and I cleaned the pot,

52
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,964
and I boiled the water, and I
made the rice, and I was going

53
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,800
to have a warm meal for
everybody when they woke up.

54
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,764
Dig in, let's go.
>> ALICIA: It's like rice

55
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,308
porridge.
>> JEFF V.: It cooked too long,

56
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,477
and it was mashy and just nasty.
>> KIMMI: You know what?

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,605
We could use this as the
wallpaper glue to hold

58
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,483
everything together.
>> MICHAEL: It was odd that in

59
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,318
fact it not only wasn't
appreciated, they didn't like

60
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,112
it.
>> KIMMI: Mike, baby, we love

61
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:03,201
you, but you're not qualified.
>> MICHAEL: I think people are

62
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,495
starting to get a little bit
edgy without food, and they

63
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,623
don't realize how bad it's going
to get.

64
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,541
I'm a student of nutrition, and
I know what this is doing to my

65
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,128
body.
But these other people have no

66
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,839
idea.
If they did, they would be out

67
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,717
fishing and hunting for food.
But they don't.

68
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:24,180
I guess maybe the way that I can
convince them of the importance

69
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:28,434
of the food is by catching a lot
of it and then feeling full one

70
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,397
time and seeing what happens to
their body and how much energy

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,357
they have.
Maybe that's how I can convince

72
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:49,330
them.
>> KEL: Maralyn, I'm going to go

73
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,915
out and check the trap.
>> MARALYN: Okay.

74
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,542
>> MITCHELL: Kel is like the
fisherman of the group.

75
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,503
He's very persistent in that
area, and part of me thinks it's

76
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,424
because he feels if he does
catch a fish, that might, um,

77
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:05,680
keep him here longer.
>> MARALYN: Good luck.

78
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,434
>> KEL: Thank you.
Thank you.

79
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,437
>> MARALYN: There's a time to be
energized, and there's a time to

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,733
just chill out.
So we're going to the family

81
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:25,450
whirlpool.
( laughter )

82
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,036
>> MARALYN: This will feel so
good.

83
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:36,377
You'll be in ecstasy.
( indistinct chatter )

84
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,379
>> JERRI: Look at us, just
hanging out like we're on

85
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,215
vacation.
This is great.

86
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,597
>> KEL: Our food strategy right
now is rice.

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,683
I mean, rice is our staple.
I don't see that rice lasting us

88
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,228
more than ten days.
We do need to get some fish out

89
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,439
of this river.
>> KEITH: Our plan for getting

90
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,942
food is, uh...
We don't really have a good

91
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:04,113
plan, actually.
No fish.

92
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,573
Are we worried if there's no
fish in the water?

93
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,950
>> COLBY: I'm not worried.
>> MITCHELL: There ain't no fish

94
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,912
in this water, I'll tell you
that.

95
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,663
I say stop wasting the energy
on fishing.

96
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,623
And I don't think there's any
fish out there.

97
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:21,464
( laughs )
>> KEL: We've got some great

98
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,466
hooks that were in the crate.
but I don't have any fishing

99
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,634
line.
And so what I've had to use is

100
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,262
twine, and twine, um, is not as
great as fishing line-- it

101
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,474
breaks, you have to weave it
together to get through the

102
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,601
hole.
The fish can see it, obviously,

103
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,813
and plus the twine floats, so I
have to tie a rock to the twine

104
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,649
to make the twine sink which
makes it even more noticeable to

105
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,319
the fish.
>> COLBY: Kel's done a little

106
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,780
bit of fishing which just, I
mean, come on, the guy couldn't

107
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,614
fish a rubber ducky out of the
bathtub.

108
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,616
The bait choices, the-the
lines...

109
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:54,997
He's just going about it the
wrong way.

110
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,625
>> KEL: So I've been trying to
fish every day, and I've been

111
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,876
unsuccessful, but I'm not going
to quit.

112
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,672
I'm going to keep on doing it
and doing it and doing it until

113
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:07,510
I can find a great fishing spot
or a technique that works.

114
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,805
>> JERRI: Believe me, when he
goes out, I'm hoping more than

115
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,224
anybody that he's going to come
back with some fish and some

116
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,017
shrimp, and he'll have a big
seafood buffet.

117
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,312
Any luck out there?
>> KEL: No, but there are fish

118
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,022
out there.
I saw quite a few.

119
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,401
>> JERRI But it's not happening.
And it's... ( laughs )

120
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,528
He's just, he's not a
fisherman, obviously.

121
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:32,160
He should keep his day job.
( laughing )

122
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,709
>> JEFF V.: Oh, wow.
>> ALICIA: Whoa.

123
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,546
This is big time.
>> JEFF V.: It's a reward.

124
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,841
>> ALICIA: There we go.
>> JEFF V.: "A leap of faith is

125
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,885
not for the skilled.
Just step off the edge, try not

126
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,887
to get killed.
Like Sundance and Butch..."

127
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,930
>> ALICIA ( gasps ): We're
jumping off a cliff.

128
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,557
>> JEFF V.: "...you'll jump from
a cliff.

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,517
Count on your friends while
you're set adrift."

130
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,853
>> ALICIA: You guys?
>> JEFF V.: We've got a big one.

131
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,729
>> ALICIA: Did anybody
see Sundance?

132
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,231
We get two blankets if we
win.

133
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,983
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh.
>> ALICIA: Feel it.

134
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,068
Two full-size blankets.
>> NICK: How nice it'll be

135
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,738
with blankets, man.
>> ALICIA: Oh, my God.

136
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,741
We'll definitely sleep through
the night if we have blankets.

137
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,618
>> KIMMI: Everybody has to jump?
>> NICK: You're jumping off a

138
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,453
cliff, bad boy.
>> JEFF V.: Can you jump off a

139
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,746
cliff?
>> RODGER: Into what?

140
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,123
>> JEFF V.: Into water.
>> RODGER: "Step off the edge"?

141
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,083
That's-that's... that's going
over something.

142
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,627
And we're off the edge.
>> NICK: Yeah, I'm psyched.

143
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,880
>> RODGER: "And try not to get
killed."

144
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,758
Today's challenge is, I
believe, is probably going to be

145
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,760
jumping off a cliff into some
water.

146
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,263
Water is not mine finest... my
uh, finest point, so, uh, I'm a

147
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,557
little apprehension.
But, uh, I figure if the rest of

148
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,768
them can do it, I can, too,
so I'm going to give it a shot.

149
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,811
>> JEFF V.: We got his back.
We got your back.

150
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,606
Rodger is the only one that I'm
a little iffy about.

151
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,775
I think everybody else is going
to go over it.

152
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,820
But he can't swim.
He can tread water, lightly.

153
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,073
>> RODGER: I just, basically,
learned to swim right before we

154
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,325
came out here.
Plus I'm... I really got a

155
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,286
little fear of heights, too.
I mean, you're talking to a guy

156
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,747
that wouldn't even ride the
Ferris wheel at the fairs,

157
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,876
'cause I just-just never did
like heights.

158
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:33,364
>> JEFF: What's up, guys?
This is a reward challenge.

159
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,157
It's called "Butch Cassidy" and
you're playing for two warm

160
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,494
blankets.
It is the rainy season.

161
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,329
They're probably going to come
in handy.

162
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,664
The game is this:
There are two crates, one for

163
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,791
each tribe, anchored out in the
water below.

164
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,211
Your challenge:
Get your tribe's crate across

165
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,672
the finish line at the old
miner's camp first.

166
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,676
Winners keep the blankets that
are sealed inside.

167
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,679
One member from each tribe, on
my start, is going to jump off

168
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,099
this cliff, they'll swim out and
grab on to the crate.

169
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,685
And then the next member will
jump off and swim out.

170
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,687
You can't jump until the person
in front of you has touched the

171
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,190
crate.
Once all the members from the

172
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,860
tribe have arrived, you've got
to dive down, unhook the crate

173
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,821
from its anchor, and then swim
with it down the river through

174
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,198
the rapids and make your way up
the beach.

175
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,910
First tribe to get their crate
onto the platform at the end

176
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,122
wins the challenge and the
blankets.

177
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,584
>> ALICIA: Let's go, Kucha.
( indistinct conversations )

178
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,671
Just run and jump and work
magic.

179
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,300
>> JEFF: Survivors ready?
Go!

180
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:42,058
( excited shouting, whooping )
>> JEFF V.: Go, Mike!

181
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,768
>> MITCHELL: Go, go, go, go!
( indistinct shouting )

182
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:49,357
>> JEFF V.: Go left, Mike.
Go left.

183
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,028
( excited shouting )
>> ALICIA: Go! Go!

184
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,204
>> ALICIA: Go right, go right!
>> NICK: Go right!

185
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,581
>> COLBY: That a way, Mitchell.
Go, Mitch, go!

186
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,917
>> MARALYN: Come on, Mitchell!
>> Go!

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,547
( laughter )
>> Oh, my God.

188
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:21,597
>> Go...!
( excited shouting )

189
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,978
( yelling )
>> Good job! Go! Go! Go!

190
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:38,406
>> Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go!
( excited shouting )

191
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,825
>> Come on, Rodger!
Let's go...

192
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,995
( indistinct shouting )
You can do it!

193
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,749
>> Come on, Rodger.
( indistinct shouting )

194
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:58,134
>> Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go
( excited shouting )

195
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,927
>> Come on, Rodger!
>> Come on, Rodger.

196
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,807
You can do it.
>> Come on, Rodger, you can do

197
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,267
it!
>> Come on, Rodger!

198
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,478
>> KIMMI: You can do it, Rodger!
>> ELISABETH: Let's go.

199
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,648
Here we go.
>> JERRI: Go!

200
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:17,528
( indistinct shouting )
>> KEL: Go!

201
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:22,032
>> ALICIA: Come on, grab on.
( indistinct shouting )

202
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:30,791
>> ALICIA: Ready? Go.
Come on, come on.

203
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,543
>> JEFF V.: Did you get it?
>> NICK: I got it.

204
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,713
>> JEFF V.: Go! Go!
>> ALICIA: Go! Go!

205
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:42,928
>> Good job. Pull!
( instinct shouting )

206
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,353
>> ALICIA: Nobody gives up.
Nobody gives up.

207
00:12:51,437 --> 00:13:02,490
>> ELISABETH: Go, Kucha.
>> MARALYN: Oh, my God.

208
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,201
>> ELISABETH: Hang right!
Hang right!

209
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,997
( indistinct shouting )
( panting )

210
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,212
>> JEFF V.: Under the bottom...
>> ALICIA: Guys, get those...

211
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:25,262
>> AMBER: Oh, the sand's so hot!
( indistinct talking )

212
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:32,561
>> MICHAEL: One, two, three.
( whooping )

213
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,480
( panting, sighing )
>> AMBER: Good job, guys.

214
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,023
>> RODGER: I'm glad that's over.
>> ELISABETH: You've swam more

215
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,526
than you've ever swum in your
life.

216
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:43,405
>> JEFF: Guys, open that crate
up-- blankets inside.

217
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,826
You guys are on a hot streak.
Two in a row.

218
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,273
>> JERRI: I want to sleep one
good night.

219
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,899
>> COLBY: Did you sleep good
last night?

220
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,819
>> JERRI: No.
>> COLBY: Neither did I.

221
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:26,282
>> MARALYN: You know, all it
takes is one small mound in the

222
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,869
ground to really screw with your
body bad.

223
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,121
( scattered chuckling )
>> TINA: You know, we're not

224
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,624
getting eight hours' sleep.
We're not getting, you know, but

225
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,794
a handful of food a day.
But, you know, this is the game

226
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,630
we signed up to play.
>> KEITH: You guys hungry?

227
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,882
>> MARALYN: Yes.
>> JERRI: Are you cooking?

228
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,802
>> AMBER: Keith said he's a
chef, but, and it's not that I

229
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,471
don't believe it-- he can't
cook very well, you know?

230
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,516
And I'm not doubting his talent.
But I think it might be that

231
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,810
he's adding, maybe, too much
water to the rice.

232
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:58,147
>> TINA: It's pasty.
It tastes like glue.

233
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,149
It just... in your mouth it goes
( smacking )

234
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,818
It's just horrible, and I can't
eat it.

235
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,486
>> It just... it didn't make
sense.

236
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
It didn't make sense.
Like, how could a gourmet chef

237
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:11,285
not know how to make rice?
There's a bunch more things we

238
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,329
can have than rice, and I'm
ready to start making some of

239
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,790
them.
I remembered that with flour and

240
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,877
water you can create some sort
of dough.

241
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,170
>> KEITH: You know what we can
do, while you're doing that?

242
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,547
We're going to go get some more
wood.

243
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,132
>> JERRI: All right.
>> KEITH: So we'll be back in a

244
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:35,225
little while.
>> JERRI: Keith is very

245
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,978
threatened by the fact that I
made this tortilla this morning.

246
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,272
That's why... I heard them when
they went up on the hill, and

247
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,983
they were gathering wood, he was
talking, again, about what he's

248
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,195
going to do with the rice and
the vegetables and this...

249
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,655
You know, you just have to
laugh.

250
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,532
You just have to laugh.
( giggling )

251
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,161
>> KEITH: So there's so much
work to do as a team that, uh,

252
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,413
and it's hard, physical labor to
come up here and grab all these

253
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,706
big logs and stuff and throw
them down.

254
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,751
So, if she wants to cook some
tortillas for breakfast, I think

255
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,878
it's fantastic.
Actually, it's a break for me,

256
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,588
you know?
No... ( chuckles ) no worries,

257
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,257
mate.
>> JERRI: I felt a little bit

258
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,053
bad about it, but at the same
time, you know, I felt like it

259
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,597
was time for somebody to come in
and take charge and change the

260
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,184
food situation.
Go ahead.

261
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:22,272
Go ahead.
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.

262
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,693
It is so good.
>> TINA: Thank you.

263
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,069
>> JERRI: Ah, you're welcome.
>> AMBER: I love it!

264
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,197
I love it.
>> JERRI: We will eat today.

265
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,199
>> AMBER: Slap me five.
>> TINA: Jerri's going to take

266
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,953
that job over, which I hope
doesn't hurt Keith's feelings.

267
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,204
You know, I mean, that's his
area, and it's kind of a slap in

268
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:41,083
the face.
>> KEL: Thanks, Jerri.

269
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,835
>> JERRI: Today's communion.
>> MITCHELL: Wow.

270
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,003
>> KEITH: Finest the restaurant
in the world couldn't have made

271
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,256
those that nice.
>> JERRI: Keith has gone out of

272
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,008
his way to compliment me a lot
now, to, like, try and smooth

273
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,470
the edges.
And I see... I mean, I see right

274
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,889
through it.
I don't-I don't think his

275
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,891
compliments are necessarily very
genuine.

276
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,810
>> KEITH: That is good.
I'm so glad they put wheat in

277
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,729
there.
>> COLBY: Thanks, Jerri.

278
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,773
>> JERRI: You know, the morale
right now is kind of low, but I

279
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,276
think the tortilla made
everybody spark up, so I'm

280
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,112
really stoked about that.
And I got a few other tricks to

281
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:20,956
pull out of my sleeve.
>> MICHAEL: I want to bring food

282
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,417
today.
If I can keep providing food, I

283
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,462
absolutely am sure I will make
the merger.

284
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,340
If I can't, I become vulnerable.
I've been thinking a lot about

285
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,303
the fact that at Tribal Council
it came out that I was the

286
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:39,141
leader, and I don't really want
to be seen as the leader.

287
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,436
So if I can get something, I'll
lay real low on the other

288
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,314
leadership areas and just be the
food guy.

289
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:52,446
>> KIMMI: We got fish!
It looks like you just went to

290
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,572
the fish market with all that
fish.

291
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,450
>> ALICIA: Look at that.
Who's better than you right

292
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,494
now?
There's nobody I can think of.

293
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,038
>> JEFF V.: When other people
catch a fish, they just catch a

294
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,164
fish.
But when Mike catches it, there

295
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,291
are trumpets that blare and
angels that sing.

296
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,669
And, you know, everybody's got
to sit down and gather round him

297
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,464
and hold his hands and watch him
carve it out.

298
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,175
>> MICHAEL: Ow.
Here you go.

299
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,219
>> ALICIA: Wow!
>> MICHAEL: Dear God, you know I

300
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,722
said a lot of prayers today, and
You answered them with fish for

301
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,183
us.
And I am so happy to be able to

302
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,978
provide fish for the troops.
I know that this could easily

303
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,649
get turned around in some way to
make me be the leader of the

304
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,528
tribe, but this meal is, from
the bottom of my heart, makes me

305
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,405
so happy to be able to provide
for everybody here.

306
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,367
So... thanks for that.
>> NICK: Amen.

307
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,078
>> ALICIA: Amen.
>> RODGER: Good job.

308
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,331
>> KIMMI: Mike thanked God for
making him the leader of the

309
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,375
tribe.
I don't know when he was

310
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,754
anointed, but apparently, my
back was turned at that moment.

311
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,381
>> MICHAEL: Oh, my God.
>> RODGER: Well, get you another

312
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,049
bite.
>> MICHAEL: No, no, no.

313
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,467
Take one bite and just keep
passing them...

314
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,386
>> RODGER: Michael does like to
be in the limelight.

315
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,179
I don't think there's any doubt
about that.

316
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,264
But as long as Mike keeps
delivering the food though,

317
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,600
that's going to be a hard one to
knock off, you know.

318
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,520
>> ALICIA: He really thinks he
is leader of this tribe.

319
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,857
I'm telling you now that there
are people in this tribe that

320
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:22,452
want to vote him off already.
>> MARALYN: I am very

321
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,874
disappointed at what happened
five minutes ago.

322
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:32,588
Jerri reported to the rest of us
that she had seen Kel chewing a

323
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,968
brown substance.
What she thought was beef jerky.

324
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,470
>> JERRI: And I saw him put
something in his mouth and it

325
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,933
was like dark brown colored,
shredded looking sort of thing.

326
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,603
>> MITCHELL: Jerri blatantly
that said she saw something that

327
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,479
looked just like beef jerky go
into his mouth.

328
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,772
And I... I believe her,
actually.

329
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,650
>> JERRI: I guarantee it was.
>> AMBER: I saw him chewing, but

330
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,277
you saw...
>> COLBY: I saw him chewing,

331
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,404
too.
>> JERRI: I mean to have your

332
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,489
own team member possibly be
holding food behind you and

333
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,452
surviving on their own little
private stash while the rest of

334
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,497
us are... starving basically is
not a good way to start off on

335
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,292
the right foot with a bunch of
strangers.

336
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,129
Because to think that someone in
our own tribe would be, you

337
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:17,799
know, sneaking in extra stuff,
especially food.

338
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,426
>> MITCHELL: Well, if you're
eating anything that we weren't

339
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,470
eating, then that's unfair to
the rest of us.

340
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,265
>> TINA: If he had beef jerky,
I'd kill him dead.

341
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,643
>> MARALYN: The pot starts to
boil.

342
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:33,398
While Kel was up on the hill,
they rifled through his bag.

343
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,484
>> TINA: You know, it was like a
big feeding frenzy.

344
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,110
You know, "Kel's got beef
jerky."

345
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,987
And they said, "Look in his
backpack real quick."

346
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,114
And I was standing right there,
and I did it.

347
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,825
And there wasn't anything in
there at all.

348
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,995
But still and yet, all I was
thinking about, "If I find beef

349
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,997
jerky in here, it's going to be
ugly."

350
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,625
>> COLBY: He's snacking up
there, I know it.

351
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,544
( scattered chuckling )
>> MARALYN: Ouch.

352
00:20:54,628 --> 00:21:02,010
Within earshot of Kel, it was
overheard, and Kel came back

353
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,512
down.
>> KEITH: Hey, Kel.

354
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,306
>> KEL: How you doing?
>> KEITH: Good. How are you?

355
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,265
>> KEL: Good.
Hey.

356
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,184
Hey, guys?
>> MARALYN: Did you find

357
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,269
anything?
>> KEL: How are you guys doing?

358
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,688
>> MARALYN: Did you find
anything?

359
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,898
>> KEL: Just a second, just a
second.

360
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,026
How are you guys doing?
Look, while I was going up there

361
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,696
looking for bait for fishing,
you guys were talking about that

362
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,989
you thought I was eating beef
jerky...

363
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,409
That was a blade of grass, and I
smooshed it up into my jaw, and

364
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:29,204
I was chewing on that.
I was just chewing grass.

365
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,623
>> JERRI: Well, in order to put
grass in your mouth, you have to

366
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,709
go get grass first.
And I don't think you get grass

367
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,711
out of your pocket.
>> KEL: Just chewing a piece...

368
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,587
>> JERRI: What kind of grass?
>> KEL: Green grass.

369
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,588
Just any kind of grass you can
pick up.

370
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,508
>> AMBER: How do you know it's
not poisonous?

371
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,219
>> KEL: Uh, I mean, it looks...
it looks like normal grass,

372
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,221
okay?
It just looks like a normal

373
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,598
blade of grass, so I mean...
>> KEITH: We don't need you, uh,

374
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,559
sick at these competitions.
>> KEL: Well, I want to just

375
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,060
make sure that you guys know
that.

376
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,895
I'm really trying to be a part
of this group.

377
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,189
It's really important for me to
try to assimilate.

378
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,442
I may not be the most talkative
one in here, I'm a fairly quiet

379
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:02,446
person...
>> JERRI: Mm...

380
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,488
>> KEITH: Well, thanks for
coming and telling us.

381
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,616
>> JERRI: Yeah, we appreciate
the explanation.

382
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,036
>> KEL: No problem.
>> JERRI: We're-we're just, you

383
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,620
know, when someone's chewing
something and nobody else is and

384
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,749
everybody's starving.
>> KEL: Well, I just find it

385
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,168
really comical that you would
think I would do that.

386
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,045
>> MARALYN: I think it's pretty
comical...

387
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,255
>> KEL: I think it's... I think
it's comical myself.

388
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:25,761
( scattered chuckling )
And that also brings up another

389
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,722
point-- I was going to do this
later on tonight.

390
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,142
I know during the competition,
you guys were talking about your

391
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,436
faces were getting scruffy, and
the girls were talking about

392
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,814
wanting to shave their legs.
I've got three blades out here.

393
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,442
The girls can use one blade, the
guys can use the other blade.

394
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,651
I have no problem with that
whatsoever.

395
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:47,324
>> JERRI: He suddenly, at that
point, offered his razor.

396
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,619
And I think that that's the
hugest sign of guilt is to give

397
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,955
to the people who have just
accused you of something that is

398
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,333
very serious.
>> JERRI: I will totally take

399
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,459
you up on that.
That's very gracious of you,

400
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:03,090
actually.
>> KEL: No problem.

401
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,304
Sorry for the awkward moment.
I will now leave you guys in

402
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,766
peace, and I'll go in my boat
and try finding some kind of

403
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:17,145
fish with the bait I have.
>> MARALYN: I suggested to them

404
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,775
all, "Hey, what you all did was
totally inappropriate.

405
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,612
It was wrong.
Nobody had any right to go into

406
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:32,327
Kel's bag."
I said, "Don't you think that it

407
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,496
would be in the best interest of
the team to be big enough to

408
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:40,001
apologize to him?"
Without real proof, it would be

409
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:45,298
very big of us to apologize.
>> JERRI: No.

410
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,678
>> MARALYN: Okay.
They said, "No. No."

411
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,557
( laughter )
>> JERRI: I think-I think

412
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,979
Maralyn is kind of upset at us.
>> MARALYN: Gee whiz, four days,

413
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:03,984
things are heating up at our
encampment.

414
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:19,207
>> NICK: It's on a bone.
>> ALICIA: Oh, boy.

415
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,001
>> NICK: "Want to try a new
dish?

416
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,712
Take care what you wish.
Next challenge may go too far.

417
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,506
Just say 'Rub-A-Dub-Dub,' thank
God for the grub.

418
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,591
Close your eyes, plug your nose
and swallow hard."

419
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,718
We're eating...
>> ALICIA: We're eating bugs.

420
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,220
>> NICK: We're eating something
crazy.

421
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,889
>> ALICIA: We got this one.
We're eating bugs.

422
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,099
>> NICK: We're eating something.
>> ELISABETH: We should have

423
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,726
just been really hungry this
morning.

424
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,728
>> MICHAEL: Food is food, right?
>> KIMMI: What kind of bug?

425
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,729
>> MICHAEL: It's a worm.
>> ALICIA: It's grub.

426
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,106
>> JEFF V.: It's grub.
It's a worm.

427
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,733
>> NICK: You guys want to hear
it?

428
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,942
>> ALICIA: You guys ready to
hear this?

429
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:49,321
It's on a bone.
>> KIMMI: Our immunity challenge

430
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:53,533
came to us and it's something
about rub-a-dub-dub, we're

431
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,036
eating a grub or something.
( disgusted grunt )

432
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,914
Let me go last.
I'm a vegetarian, which means I

433
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,751
don't eat land-dwelling animals.
I'm not going to compromise my,

434
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:07,756
you know, situation, um, now.
>> I'm not eating amphibian.

435
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,884
I'm not eating reptile.
I'm not eating mammal.

436
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,761
I'm not eating foul.
>> ALICIA: Kimmi's not going to

437
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,722
compromise her morals, but
coming into a game like this,

438
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,058
you can't come in with a whole
list of things you're not going

439
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,435
to do and you're not going to
eat because you're not helping

440
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,063
your tribe, you're not helping
your team morale.

441
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,107
( disgusted groan )
>> MICHAEL: If Rodger can jump

442
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,236
off a cliff and swim that long
distance and down the rapids

443
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,822
with never having swum before, I
think Kimmi should be able to

444
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,950
reach down and be able to do
this.

445
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,870
>> JEFF V.: Oh, my God.
>> KIMMI: You know what?

446
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,749
I can't do it, and I'm
disappointing six people that

447
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:47,295
are rooting for me.
Now, you know, I have no excuse

448
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,674
for-for not being, um, voted off
the island.

449
00:25:50,757 --> 00:26:00,767
I could be gone, just like that.
>> JEFF: I'll take the immunity

450
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:11,361
I could be gone, just like that.
>> JEFF: I'll take the immunity

451
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:15,490
idol.
It's back up for grabs.

452
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:19,160
I'll explain the game.
I know you guys are hungry so

453
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,455
we've put together one of the
finest samplings of true

454
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,915
Aboriginal food, what they call
bush tucker.

455
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,835
As you guys know, the
Aboriginals have lived out here

456
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,547
for thousands of years,
literally by eating everything.

457
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,341
Nothing goes to waste.
Here's how it's going to work.

458
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,468
One member from each tribe will
come up.

459
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,848
I'll spin the wheel, and you'll
eat what's on here.

460
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,685
Also on the wheel, some treats
that might go down a little

461
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,021
easier.
If you're lucky, maybe you'll

462
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,065
get the fruit or the candy bar.
Since Kucha is short one member,

463
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,067
one of your members will have to
eat twice.

464
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,363
So whoever you select to go
first, will also eat last.

465
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,491
Now if you pass, and you don't
eat or you can't finish, you

466
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,702
lose a point.
At the end of one round, whoever

467
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,038
has the most points get the
immunity idol.

468
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,124
Losers lose another member
at tomorrow night's Tribal

469
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,501
Council.
Going down and coming back up

470
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,711
doesn't count.
It's got to stay down.

471
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,714
And the way you know is you show
me your mouth.

472
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,843
I look in, I don't see anything,
I'll say good to go.

473
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,603
This the mangrove worm.
It lives in little mangrove

474
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,730
trees.
It usually burrows a small hole

475
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,108
in its infancy stage, and then
as it grows, the hole gets

476
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,236
deeper and deeper and deeper,
sort of like a termite.

477
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,614
What are you taking out?
>> MARALYN: I'm ready.

478
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,407
>> JEFF: You're taking out your
teeth.

479
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,910
( scattered chuckling )
Mad Dog has just taken out her

480
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,789
teeth.
>> MICHAEL: Oh, my God.

481
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,417
JEFF: Here we go, guys.
Three, two, one.

482
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:54,005
You're on.
>> AMBER: Go, Maralyn.

483
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,925
>> JEFF: Let's see.
Good.

484
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,053
( Maralyn choking )
>> KEL: Come on, Maralyn.

485
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,430
>> JERRI: You can do it.
You can do it.

486
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,058
It's an oyster. It's an oyster.
>> JEFF: Got a bucket if you

487
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,728
need it, Maralyn.
>> MARALYN: Water?

488
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,147
>> JERRI: You got it.
( Maralyn choking )

489
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,774
It's all right.
( Maralyn puffing )

490
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:17,445
>> JERRI: Yeah!
( whooping )

491
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,908
>> MARALYN: Oh!
>> JEFF: Next two.

492
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:33,461
( Kimmi yells )
>> KIMMI: Brain.

493
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,963
>> JEFF: You got cow brain
there.

494
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,840
The good news is it's pretty
fresh.

495
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,466
It should have a nice taste to
it.

496
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,093
You guys ready for this?
>> KEITH: Sure.

497
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:44,013
>> JEFF: Three, two, one.
We're on.

498
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:48,435
>> KIMMI: I can't.
I can't eat a brain.

499
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,812
>> KEITH: Can we have some to
take back to camp with us?

500
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,314
>> MITCHELL: Yeah, Keith.
>> AMBER: You are the man.

501
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,442
>> MITCHELL: You the man.
>> KIMMI: I can't do it.

502
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,445
>> JEFF: Taking a pass, Kimmi?
>> KIMMI: It's a mammal.

503
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:04,826
I can't do it.
Sorry.

504
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,787
>> JEFF: Okay.
Let's see your mouth.

505
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,998
You're good.
Ogakor is one up.

506
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:14,878
>> AMBER: Yeah, Keith.
Next two.

507
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,971
That's mud whelk.
It's the shellfish you find

508
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,057
seaside.
Three, two, one.

509
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,185
We're on.
>> AMBER: Oh, that's nice.

510
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,395
>> COLBY: Atta-girl.
>> AMBER: That's it.

511
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:37,984
>> COLBY: Just swallow it.
>> NICK: You've got to savor it.

512
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,360
>> JEFF: Kind of crunchy, huh,
Jerri?

513
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,155
>> JERRI: Mmm.
>> JEFF V.: Let's get that thing

514
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,990
down, Nick.
>> ALICIA: Yeah, yeah.

515
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,075
No, no, no, hold it, hold it,
hold it. Hold it.

516
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,370
>> JEFF: I'll give you five
seconds.

517
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:53,625
Five, four, three, two, one.
>> AMBER: Come on, Jerri.

518
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:57,045
>> JEFF: Look at that.
( Jerri screams happily )

519
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,881
>> MARALYN: All right!
( Maralyn yells happily )

520
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:11,893
>> JEFF: Next two.
Kel and Elisabeth.

521
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,896
You got the apple.
>> MARALYN: Wow!

522
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,525
>> KEL: Yeah! Yeah!
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.

523
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:24,572
( scattered chuckles )
>> JEFF: Next two.

524
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,076
>> MARALYN: Whatever it is, you
got it.

525
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,079
>> JEFF: That is witchety grub
larva.

526
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:35,750
This will become a moth.
It's in its early stages.

527
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,753
Ogakor you got a lead.
Three, two, one.

528
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,255
>> JERRI: Go.
Come on, Mitchell.

529
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:47,387
Go, Mitchell, go, Mitchell.
( laughing and cheering )

530
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,224
>> KEITH: Way to go, all right!
>> JEFF: Here we go.

531
00:30:51,307 --> 00:31:01,150
>> JERRI: You can do it, Amber.
>> ALICIA: Ah! You suck.

532
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,945
>> JEFF: The pincers, you can
break off.

533
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,282
Everything else, you're eating.
Three, two, one.

534
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,244
>> TINA: Eat it little by
little, if you have to.

535
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:15,331
( indistinct talking )
>> COLBY: There you go.

536
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,333
All right.
>> Chips. Potato chips.

537
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,503
Ranch potato chips.
( indistinct talking )

538
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,548
>> JERRI: You got it.
>> COLBY: Okay, you got it.

539
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,925
>> RODGER: Swallow, swallow.
>> JEFF V.: Yeah!

540
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,135
>> MARALYN: Don't... don't think
about what's going through your

541
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,512
head right now.
It's a mental picture.

542
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:33,308
( cheering )
>> KEITH: All right.

543
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,312
( cheering )
>> COLBY: Yeah!

544
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:42,775
( indistinct talking )
>> JEFF: Here we go, guys.

545
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,823
>> COLBY Big bucks, big bucks.
No whammies.

546
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,325
Ooh.
Get past that.

547
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:56,039
( cheering )
>> JEFF: It's a candy bar.

548
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,166
Life is working for you guys.
>> MITCHELL: Go ahead, man.

549
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,251
Enjoy it.
We're with you in spirit.

550
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:05,131
>> JEFF: Last two.
Tina, Michael, you're up again.

551
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,342
Here's where we're at.
Kimmi passed, therefore, Kucha

552
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,970
is down one point.
Tina, if you swallow this last

553
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,974
one, your team wins immunity.
But if you don't and Michael

554
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:18,186
swallows his, we have a tie.
This is it, for immunity.

555
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,737
>> Perfect. Yeah.
>> JEFF: You got tripe, a cow's

556
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,656
stomach lining.
>> AMBER: Oh, Tina, that's the

557
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,658
best one.
>> JERRI: Steak. That's a steak.

558
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,159
>> AMBER: That's a steak.
>> RODGER: That's a sirloin.

559
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,411
>> JEFF: Three, two, one.
We're on.

560
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,163
>> JERRI: Prime rib, baby.
Prime rib.

561
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:41,250
Prime rib, prime rib.
>> JEFF: It's chewier than you

562
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,379
would expect.
>> JERRI: It's prime rib.

563
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,924
( indistinct talking )
>> KEL: It's okay, Tina.

564
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,760
>> JEFF: Okay?
>> JERRI: You're good, Tina,

565
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,262
you're good.
( gagging sound )

566
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,724
>> You're getting protein.
( gagging sound )

567
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,687
>> NICK: Slimy cow...
>> AMBER: Cover your mouth.

568
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,479
>> JEFF: You got a bucket, you
got a bucket.

569
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:05,108
It came up.
>> NICK: It came up.

570
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,276
( Tina retching )
>> It's all right.

571
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,238
No thing, no big thing.
>> TINA: Oh, sorry, guys.

572
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,742
( cheering )
>> JEFF: All right, guys, here's

573
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,077
how the tiebreaker is going to
work.

574
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,247
Ogakor, you select a member from
Kucha.

575
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,291
Kucha, you select your member
from Ogakor.

576
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,586
>> ALICIA: Tina's up.
>> JEFF: Tina?

577
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,088
>> ALICIA: Tina's up.
>> JEFF: Right here, Kimmi?

578
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,215
>> Kimmi.
>> JEFF: Kimmi.

579
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:33,261
Your challenge is going to be to
take a whole mangrove worm.

580
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,638
>> ALICIA: This is all you,
girl.

581
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,099
>> JEFF: The first person to
completely swallow it, show me

582
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,183
their mouth, that it's empty,
wins.

583
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,146
( all talking at once )
>> KIMMI: I can eat a worm.

584
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,107
I can eat a worm.
I can eat a worm.

585
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,778
>> JEFF: Three, two, one.
Go.

586
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,654
>> ALICIA: Swallow the whole
thing.

587
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,990
>> Pick it up.
>> TINA: She dropped it.

588
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,160
>> Eat it, eat it.
>> You got it.

589
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:04,000
( all talking at once )
( cheering )

590
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:19,140
>> JEFF: Kimmi, come here.
Immunity for Kucha.

591
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:29,233
( cheering )
>> TINA: I'll definitely feel

592
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:47,960
( cheering )
>> TINA: I'll definitely feel

593
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,672
bad about having to vote
somebody off.

594
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,341
There's some humiliation
involved with being the first

595
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:59,013
one voted off.
>> You know, it's a bittersweet

596
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:00,848
opportunity.
Actually, it's a bitter

597
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,142
opportunity.
There is no sweetness to it.

598
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,061
We have to eliminate a person
within our group.

599
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,647
It could be me.
I mean, it really could be me.

600
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,108
For all I know, I could be the
individual going.

601
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,194
>> MITCHELL: Keith is, um, he's
a bit bossy.

602
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:18,491
He's very condescending, and
he's definitely... close to

603
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:23,329
going.
>> COLBY: If you were looking to

604
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,873
paint a bull's-eye on someone,
obviously Keith has struck a

605
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:30,670
nerve in a few people.
But also Jerri.

606
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,339
She's certainly, um, a very
strong girl and very set in her

607
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,843
ways.
>> JERRI: Really?

608
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,555
>> COLBY: And sometimes a little
unforgiving in certain areas.

609
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,723
>> JERRI: No, no, no, no.
We're going to talk right now.

610
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,684
>> COLBY: So that kind of makes
her a point of friction to some

611
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,354
people.
>> MARALYN: Some things that,

612
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:52,567
uh, that she's done have really
made me... me bristle.

613
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,735
( Jerri laughing )
>> KEL: At this point I'm going

614
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,237
to vote for Jerri.
And the reason why I'm going to

615
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,074
vote for Jerri is because I've
already told Maralyn that I was

616
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:03,244
going to do that, and I'm not
going to break my word.

617
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,371
And Maralyn told me she was
going to vote for Jerri, too.

618
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:10,960
And I trust Maralyn.
>> JERRI: I think Kel is a liar

619
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,920
and a cheat.
As much as I don't want to

620
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,298
believe that to be the truth,
he would probably be the first

621
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:24,515
one I would want to vote off.
>> AMBER: I'm ready to go.

622
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,478
>> MITCHELL: I think the name of
the game is trust no one.

623
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,272
I don't think you could trust
your own grandparents out here.

624
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,483
I mean, I think I would vote
them right off just 'cause

625
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,152
they've been married for 50
years.

626
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,615
That's a good alliance.
>> KEITH: This game is all about

627
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:46,412
deceit, deception and how to
play using your mind to win.

628
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,598
>> JEFF: All right, guys, we
begin Tribal Council with a

629
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,433
ritual.
I would like you to go ahead and

630
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:12,813
grab a torch... and approach the
flame.

631
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,482
Dip your torches in, and once
they're lit, you can put them

632
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:22,490
back in their slot.
We do this because fire does

633
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,493
represent life.
These torches will now represent

634
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,497
your life, your identity at
Tribal Council.

635
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,501
I haven't had a chance to talk
to you guys at Tribal Council

636
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,378
yet, so just a few questions
before we get to the vote.

637
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:39,298
You have fire.
You have a professional chef.

638
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,510
You guys should be eating very
well.

639
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,012
>> KEITH: You know what, until
we start really sourcing great

640
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,014
products to work with, our
creative juices are semi-limited

641
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,183
and stuff.
But we realized earlier we had

642
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,519
flour, and Jerri is a phenomenal
cook, so she steps in and she's

643
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,396
made tortillas.
We've had those for breakfast

644
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,523
every morning.
When we're done, we have Jerri's

645
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,942
tortillas shop opening up.
>> JEFF: Why are you cooking if

646
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,070
he's the chef?
( Jerri sighs )

647
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,738
>> JERRI: I knew you were going
to go there.

648
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,365
( laughs )
The rice was a little pasty the

649
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,494
first couple of nights, and it
got to the point where none of

650
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,415
us wanted to eat it, and that's
when I felt I needed to step in

651
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,252
because we were losing strength.
Our morale was down.

652
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,421
I mean, when you don't want to
even eat, that's a really bad

653
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:23,467
sign of bad things to come.
So I just took it upon myself.

654
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,428
>> JEFF: Colby, what was your
reaction to Keith's food?

655
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,722
>> COLBY: Oh, I had no problem
with it.

656
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,559
Rice is rice, man.
>> MARALYN: Jeff... if it-if it

657
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,062
goes down and doesn't come back
up, it's a good meal.

658
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,231
>> KEL: Exactly.
>> JEFF: That's what we found

659
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,900
out yesterday.
( Amber and Jerri groaning )

660
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,569
Tina, what's been your lowest
low?

661
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:46,073
>> TINA: Probably throwing up
that intestines that I ate and

662
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,576
feeling like I let my team down.
>> JEFF: So let me ask you the

663
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,079
question that is most on my
mind: Do you feel like you need

664
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,581
to say, "I know I screwed up,
but guys, here's why you should

665
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,083
keep me"?
>> TINA: Absolutely not.

666
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,085
I feel like I-I'm the one who
screwed up, I should be the

667
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,588
one to go.
>> JEFF: Having said that, it is

668
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,842
time to vote.
Jerri, you're first.

669
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:28,407
>> Nothing against you, Jerri,
but I already promised Tina and

670
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,410
Maralyn that I would not vote
against them, and I would vote

671
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,996
for you.
I made this on day one, and I

672
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,541
don't break my promises.
Sorry about that, Jerri.

673
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,596
>> MITCHELL: As much as we could
use your strength in our

674
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,474
challenges, we're a little sick
and tired of some of your games.

675
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,311
The only comfort I have in
voting this way is the fact that

676
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:58,646
you brought this on all by
yourself.

677
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:08,697
I'm sorry.
>> MARALYN: Kel.

678
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:22,670
I'm sorry.
>> MARALYN: Kel.

679
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:27,675
Kel, if you were lying in the
Simpson Desert, dying of thirst,

680
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:33,305
every single one of us would
give you a drink of water.

681
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:44,400
Good luck to you.
>> JEFF: Once the votes are

682
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,861
tallied, the decision is final.
The person will be asked to

683
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,489
leave the Tribal Council area
along this bridge.

684
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:55,077
The first vote...
Kel.

685
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:07,590
Jerri.
Kel.

686
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,974
That's three votes for Kel, one
for Jerri.

687
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,819
Four votes Kel.
The first person voted out of

688
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:33,699
the Ogakor tribe...
Kel.

689
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,785
Kel, I need you to bring your
torch.

690
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:54,678
Kel, the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.

691
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,729
Well, you survived Tribal
Council number one.

692
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,441
You have a long walk home.
Go ahead and grab your torches

693
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:10,778
and head back to camp.
See you tomorrow.

694
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:34,802
>> Stay tuned for scenes from
our next episode.

695
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:39,139
Next time on Survivor:
Jerri makes her move on Colby.

696
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,976
>> JERRI: He's a cowboy, and I'm
such a sucker for cowboys.

697
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,811
( Cobly moans )
>> COLBY: Just two school kids

698
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,982
on the playground having fun.
>> At Kucha, Michael is obsessed

699
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,817
with making a kill...
>> MICHAEL: This is a pig

700
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,652
killer.
>> ...causing tempers to flare.

701
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,445
>> That stupid spear.
That's classic Mike.

702
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,781
He's an idiot.
( Michael laughing )

703
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,330
>> KEL: I knew right from day
one that it was going to be hard

704
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,749
for me to fit in.
I'm a military guy, and the

705
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,836
people I was working with are
very unique special type of

706
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,547
people.
It was going to be very hard for

707
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,882
me to fit into that mixture.
I tried, I really did.

708
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,678
But I don't think in a couple of
days I could have overcome our

709
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,305
differences.
Good luck.

710
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,806
You're all winners to me.
