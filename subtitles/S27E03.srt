YOU ARE NO LONGER LOVED ONES,

00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:13,221
YOU ARE NOW COMPETITORS.

8
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,056
AND REDEMPTION ISLAND WAS BACK

00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,933
IN PLAY.

10
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,601
TWO PEOPLE WILL STAY ALIVE, ONE

11
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,062

00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:31,281
IDOL.

THE CLUE --

21
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,869

00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,421
WHO'S THEIR STRONGEST PLAYER AND

28
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,839
WHO WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO

29
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,506
SWITCH THAT'S STRONG?

30
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,174
>> TYSON.

31
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:49,466
>> EXACTLY.

32
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,010
>> Jeff: MEANWHILE, AT GALANG,

33
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,636
THE ENTIRE TRIBE WAS IN A ZEN

34
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:53,970
STATE OF MIND.

35
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,180
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A PART

36
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,057
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

37
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,893
>> Jeff: BUT COLTON WAS DEAD

38
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:05,482
SET ON DISTURBING THE BEAT.

39
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,191
>> HOPEFULLY THIS CAMP WILL

40
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,401
ERUPT INTO CHAOS.

41
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,570

>> SHUT IT DOWN.

44
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,242
I HOPED COLTON HAD SEEN THE WAY

45
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,494
HE'D PLAYED AND CHANGED BUT YOU

46
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,579
CAN ONLY FAKE IT FOR SO LONG.

47
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,289
>> GET IN THERE, BALL.

48
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,500

CHALLENGE -- TKPWER VAS WINS IT

50
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,422
FOR GALANG.

51
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,507
TADHANA LOST FOR THE SECOND TIME

52
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,091
IN A ROLE.

53
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,010
>> GERVASE IS TRYING TO THROW

54
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:34,427
SALT IN THE WOUND.

55
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,013
I'M GOING TO BODY SLAM THE

56
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:37,639

00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,640
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

58
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,265
THEY DIDN'T LOSE SIGHT SIGHT OF

59
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,475
THEIR PLAN.

60
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,893
>> IT'S TWISTED.

61
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,061
WE COULD WEAKEN THEIR TRIBE BY

62
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,145
VOTING SOMEBODY OUT HERE

63
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:44,354

HOPING TYSON WILL TAKE HER SPOT

66
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,150
AT THE NEXT DUEL.

67
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,527
RACHEL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

68
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,736
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

69
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,153
BACK IN THIS GAME.

70
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,531
GRAB YOUR TORCH, THOSE

71
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,198
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

72
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,908
16 ARE LEFT.

73
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:10,296
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

74
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,841
>> WHAT'S THE STRANGEST THING

75
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,217
YOU'VE EVER SEEN FOR SALE AT A

76
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,926
GAS STATION?

77
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,219
>> A CUPCAKE BELT.

78
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,388
>> YOU WENT TO THE CUP TAKE

79
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,180
SECTION AT THE GAS STATION AND

80
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,850
JUST "OH, THIS IS WHAT I WANT."

81
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,433
>> WHAT A THOUGHTFUL THING TO

82
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,184
WEAR OUT HERE.

83
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,812
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANYBODY HUNGRY

84
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,521
AT ALL, TYSON.

85
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,065
>> IT'S NOT A REAL CUPCAKE, IT'S

86
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:29,566
JUST MADE OUT OF MEDAL.

87
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,985
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO TAKE A

88
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:32,402
BITE, BE MY GUEST.

89
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,319
WHO WANTS TO TAKE A LICK.

90
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,405
>> WE HAVE TO START

91
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,322
STRATEGICALLY THINKING WHATEVER

92
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,991
THE CHALLENGE IS WHO WE'RE GOING

93
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:38,449
TO SIT OUT.

94
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,159
>> LET'S CALL EACH OTHER OUT

95
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:40,451
RIGHT NOW.

96
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,037
>> IT'S SO EARLY IN THE MORNING.

97
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:43,288
(LAUGHTER)

98
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:43,621
>> EXACTLY.

99
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,164
>> THESE PEOPLE ARE NOTHING LIKE

100
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,416
THE PEOPLE I PLAYED WITH IN "ONE

101
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:46,624
WORLD."

102
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,251
NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

103
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:48,501
STRATEGY.

104
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,753
THEY JUST WANT TO SIT AROUND AND

105
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,421
HEAR EACH OTHER'S LIFE STORIES

106
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,298
AND I'M SO FRUSTRATED BECAUSE

107
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,925
IT'S, LIKE, I LOVE THE STRATEGY

108
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,218
COMPONENT OF THIS GAME AND

109
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,137
APPARENTLY THAT'S THREATENING TO

110
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,346
PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

111
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,264
THEY'RE SCARED OF ME.

112
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,850
DO YOU THINK I'M IN TROUBLE?

113
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,311
>> YEAH.

114
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,979
BUT I CAN ALSO SAY YOU'RE NOT

115
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,813
OUT OF THE GAME.

116
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,190
>> I JUST WANT TO TOTALLY

117
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:11,774
REDEFINE HOW I PLAY THIS GAME

118
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,027
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST TOO

119
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,861
LITTLE TOO LATE NOW.

120
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,361
>> BUT IT'S NOT.

121
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,821
THINGS CHANGE.

122
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,989
PEOPLE DO STUPID THINGS.

123
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,533
YOU GOT YOURSELF IN THE FOOT

124
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,410
ONCE, THAT DOESN'T MEAN SOMEONE

125
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,328
ELSE WON'T SHOOT THEMSELVES IN

126
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,537
THE FOOT RIGHT AFTER YOU.

127
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,914
SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT GET A FIGHT

128
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,749
OR -- YOU NEVER KNOW.

129
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,626
COLTON IS A POISON OUT HERE AND

130
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,085
HE'S POISONING EVERYONE'S MIND.

131
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:31,628
HE DOESN'T GET THIS GAME.

132
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,838
HE THINKS THIS GAME IS ABOUT

133
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,715
CREATING CHAOS SO HE MIGHT HAVE

134
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,342
DUG HIS BRAVE.

135
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,593
OFF BEAUTIFUL PLACE LIKE RIGHT

136
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:38,968
NOW.

137
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,511
SPEND FIVE MINUTES RELAXING YOUR

138
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:40,720
BODY.

139
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,638
>> I COULD DO THAT IF YOU WOULD

140
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,305
JUST TELL ME "COLTON, I'LL GIVE

141
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,431
YOU A SECOND CHANCE."

142
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,225
>> I CAN'T TEAM YOU THAT.

143
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,893
JUST RELAX.

144
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,394
ENJOY YOURSELF.

145
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,771
ALL RIGHT, MAN?

146
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,814
>> I KNOW MY DAYS IN THIS GAME

147
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,107
ARE NUMBERED, YOU KNOW?

148
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,233
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WILLING

149
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,360
TO ROLL WITH YOU, THERE'S NOT A

150
00:03:55,443 --> 00:04:00,281
LOT YOU CAN DO.

151
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:13,252
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

152
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:13,836

WELCOME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

160
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,525
ARENA.

161
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,443
BEFORE WE GET TO THE DUEL,

162
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,029
TYSON, REACTION TO SEEING IT WAS

163
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,530
RACHEL WHO WAS VOTED OUT?

164
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,157
>> IT'S NOT A BAD MOVE, JEFF.

165
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,492
THEY MUST HAVE ASSUMED THAT I

166
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,869
WOULD AT LEAST HIGHLY CONSIDER

167
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,996
SWITCHING PLACES WITH HER,

168
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,538
PULLING ME OFF THE TRIBE AND

169
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,040
MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO WIN

170
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING A HARD

171
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,126
TIME RIGHT NOW.

172
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:53,710
>> Jeff: RACHEL, IS THAT WHAT

173
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,003
YOU THINK HAPPENED?

174
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,005
>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

175
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:57,255
HAPPENED.

176
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:57,839
I THINK BRAD'S LINING UP HIS

177
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,716
GAME RIGHT NOW I THINK AND

178
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,967
EVERYBODY'S JUST FALLING UNDER

179
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,551
HIS SPELL.

180
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,761
>> Jeff: TYSON, BEFORE WE GET

181
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,513
TO THE DUEL, AS IS THE CASE WITH

182
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,515
ANYBODY WHO HAS A LOVED ONE ON

>> IT'S UP TO YOU.

189
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,107
>> YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE IN

190
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,775
THIS GAME RIGHT NOW THAN I DO.

191
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,485
YOU NEED TO STAY THERE WITH YOUR

192
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:19,694
TRIBE.

193
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,611
THEY NEED YOU.

194
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,738
>> ARE YOU SURE?

195
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,864
>> YEAH.

196
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,449
YOU'VE GOT TO STAY THERE.

197
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:24,699
>> OKAY.

198
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,492
I'M STAYING.

199
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,327
>> LET'S GO, RACHEL.

200
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:28,786
>> YOU GUYS WATCH OUT.

201
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,205
IF YOU SEE ME IN REDEMPTION

202
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:31,748
ISLAND, NONE OF YOU HAVE A

203
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,498
CHANCE IN HELL.

204
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,417
MR. FOOTBALL SMILING AT ME LIKE

205
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,252
HE DOES, YOU CAN BE BIG, BUT

206
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,212
THAT'S THE WORST THING IN THIS

207
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:38,421
GAME.

208
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,464
>> WE HAVEN'T WANTED TO VOTE

209
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,631
ANYBODY OUT BUT WE HAVE TO.

210
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,050
YOU GUYS CHEER OVER THERE AFTER

211
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,217
YOU WIN AND WE HAVE TO GO HOME

212
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,385
AND GET RID OF ONE OF YOUR LOVED

213
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,594
ONES.

214
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,888
YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE DIFFICULT

215
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,056
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD.

216
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,265
NOBODY'S BEEN VOTED OUT OVER

217
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,641
THERE SO DON'T START THROWING

218
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:50,975
ARROWS AT US.

219
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,060
>> DIFFICULT?

220
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:52,894
IT SHOULD BE EASY.

221
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,103
VOTE OUT THE WEAKEST PERSON TO

222
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:54,854
HELP THE TRIBE.

223
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,605
YOU VOTED OUT TWO STRONG PEOPLE

224
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:55,813
ALREADY.

225
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,523
HENCE THE REASON WHY YOU LOST.

226
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,192
>> WE'RE PLAYING "SURVIVOR"

227
00:05:59,275 --> 00:05:59,400
BABE.

228
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,029
MAYBE THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN

229
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:03,237
THAT.

230
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,364
>> (BLEEP) YOU BRAD CULPEPPER.

231
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,450
>> HEY, MARISSA, TONE IT DOWN.

232
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,660
STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT

233
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,454
TO DO OUT HERE.

234
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,247
>> Jeff: NOW COLTON, YOU'RE

235
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:13,456
CRYING.

236
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:13,998
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT?

237
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,085
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE

238
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:17,293
ANYMORE.

239
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,586
AT ALL.

240
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,838
AND I'M SORRY!

241
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,548
>> DON'T QUIT, COLTON.

242
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:50,701
>> I CAN'T DO THIS!

243
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,536
ANYMORE, AT ALL.

244
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:51,869
AND I'M SORRY.

245
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,704
>> Jeff: MEANING WHAT?

246
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,289
MEANING YOU'RE QUITTING?

247
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:55,498
AGAIN?

248
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,541
>> DON'T QUIT, COLTON.

249
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,458
>> I CAN'T DO THIS!

250
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,627
>> Jeff: SO COLTON, YOU CAME

251
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,504
BACK FOR A SECOND TIME BECAUSE

252
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,256
YOU SAID "I'VE CHANGED.

253
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,966
I'VE GROWN AND I WANT TO SHOW

254
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:05,258
EVERYBODY."

255
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,551
YOU'RE NOW DOING THE EXACT

256
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,221
OPPOSITE.

257
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,931
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS

258
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:12,140
TRIBE.

259
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,141
>> Jeff: WELL, THAT'S CLEAR

260
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,976
BECAUSE YOU'RE PUNISHING THEM BY

261
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,269
COSTING THEM A TRIBE MEMBER IN A

262
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,687
GAME ABOUT NUMBERS IN WHICH

263
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,604
ULTIMATELY YOU MAY MERGE.

264
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,689
>> WELL, THEN MAYBE THAT'S THE

265
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,523
BEST MOVE FOR ME.

266
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,651
>> Jeff: A VERY SELFISH MOVE.

267
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,902
>> WELL --

268
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,489
>> Jeff: ADMITTEDLY A SELFISH

269
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:28,698
MOVE?

270
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,825
>> ADMITTEDLY, BUT MAYBE THE

271
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,492
BEST ONE FOR ME.

272
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,202
>> Jeff: WHAT IS IT THAT'S

273
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,996
HAPPENING ON YOUR TRIBE THAT'S

274
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,206
FORCING YOU TO QUIT THAT I CAN

275
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,416
CONFIRM FOR MYSELF IS A SECOND

276
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:38,624
TIME.

277
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,251
THE FIRST TIME YOU FEIGNED

278
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:40,585
APPENDICITIS.

279
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,337
THE SECOYOU DIDN'T HAVE IT.

280
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,630
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

281
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,966
I WAS TREATED FOR A BACTERIAL

282
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:47,216
INFECTION.

283
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,385
PEOPLE CAN SAY UNTIL THE COWS

284
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,303
COME HOME I QUIT.

285
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,554
MY BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL AND

286
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,556
WHEN MY BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL

287
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,849
I TURNED INTO THE PERSON I WAS

288
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,184
IN "ONE WORLD."

289
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,102
I'M TIRED OF BEING HATED BY

290
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:58,394
EVERYBODY.

291
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,937
I'M TIRED OF BEING --

292
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:00,605
>> YOU TURNED INTO THAT PERSON

293
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,899
BEFORE YOUR BACK WAS AGAINST THE

294
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,107
WALL.

295
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:03,733
>> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

296
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,902
JEFF, COLTON'S HAVING A HARD

297
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,321
TIME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PLAYING

298
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,615
COLTON'S GAME AND NOW HE KNOWS

299
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,074
HE CAN'T WIN THE GAME.

300
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,659
>> Jeff: IS 40 THAT HOW IT

301
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,785
GOES, COLTON?

302
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,454
IF THINGS DON'T GO YOUR WAY

303
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,539
LET'S JUST STOP?

304
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,416
>> I DON'T KNOW.

305
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:20,583
MAYBE.

306
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:20,917
I DON'T KNOW.

307
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,542
>> Jeff: SO, COLTON, ARE YOU

308
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,086
QUITTING THIS GAME?

309
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,087
>> YES.

310
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,297
>> Jeff: OKAY, YOU ARE OUT OF

311
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,132
THE GAME.

312
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,176
CALEB, THIS IS THIS HAS GOT TO

313
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,260
BE DISAPPOINTING FOR YOU?

314
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,887
>> MY HEART IS CRUMBLING BECAUSE

315
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,638
HE LOVES THE GAME.

316
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,931
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WOULDN'T

317
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,556
STICK IT OUT.

318
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,682
>> Jeff: BUT CALEB, YOU KNOW,

319
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,768
LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE TO WATCHED A

320
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:38,976
VENTURE.

321
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,062
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THEY

322
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,605
REALLY SHOULD GET UP OFF THE

323
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,064
COUCH.

324
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,232
AND I'M NOW CONVINCED THAT

325
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:44,774
COLTON IS THE GUY WHO NEVER

326
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,109
SHOULD HAVE GOT UP OFF THE

327
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:47,276
COUCH.

328
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,528
WE BROUGHT A QUITTER BACK AND WE

329
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,446
GOT A QUITTER AGAIN.

330
00:08:50,529 --> 00:09:04,585
>> I DON'T CARE WHAT Y'ALL SAY.

331
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,756
>> OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

332
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,508
IF YOU NEED TO DO THIS, JUST DO

333
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:10,675
IT.

334
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:15,680
YOU KNOW ME, I DON'T CARE.

335
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,098
>> Jeff: WELL, COLTON, YOU

336
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,182
CAME BACK FOR A SECOND TIME

337
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:18,808
BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO

338
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,519
SHOW HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN BUT

339
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,103
YOUR BEHAVIOR NOW SHOWS YOU

340
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,106
HAVEN'T AND THE IRONY IS THE

341
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:25,982
OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH YOU SEEK

342
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,150
IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

343
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:28,693
IT'S CALLED "SURVIVOR."

344
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,737
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR BUFF, I WON'T

345
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,030
GIVE YOU THE HONOR OF THROWING

346
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,241
THAT IN THE URN, WE'LL KEEP THAT

347
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:35,866
RESERVED FOR PEOPLE WHO COMPETE.

348
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,287
BOAT WILL PICK YOU UP.OUT, THEéZ

349
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,247
>> LOVE YOU, BABE.

350
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,295
CATCH YOU ON THE FLIP SIDE.

351
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,713
>> Jeff: OKAY.

352
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,755
WOW.

353
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,798
GAME CONTINUES TO CHANGE ONLY

354
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,633
SEVEN DAYS IN.

355
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,302
COLTON IS GONE.

356
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,928
TADHANA NOW IS ONLY DOWN ONE

357
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,722
TRIBE MEMBER AND NOW WE PUT OUR

358
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,015
ATTENTION BACK ON THE TASK AT

359
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,850
HAND WHICH IS TODAY'S DUEL.

360
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,560
THREE PEOPLE FIGHTING TO STAY IN

361
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,060
THIS GAME.

362
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,353
TWO OF YOU WILL SURVIVE.

363
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:04,979
ONE OF YOU IS ABOUT TO BE OUT OF

364
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,605
THIS GAME.

365
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,857
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S DUEL.

366
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,317
FOR TODAY'S DUEL YOU WILL STACK

367
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,696
A SERIES OF BLOCKS ON AN ANGULAR

368
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,531
PLATFORM AVOIDING TRIP BAR WHICH

369
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,158
IS COULD WOBBLE YOUR STACK

370
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,242
CAUSING IT TO FALL FORCING YOU

371
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,201
TO START OVER AGAIN.

372
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:19,785
YOUR GOAL IS TO STACK THEM SO

373
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,873
THEY FALL LIKE DOMINOES,

374
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,083

398
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,882
THESE TRIP BARS MAKE IT A LITTLE

399
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,633
MORE DIFFICULT.

400
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,135

ONE WILL GO HOME.

428
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,373
MARISSA TRIES IT.

429
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:29,874
IT FALLS SHORT.

430
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,959
SHE'S GOT TO RESTACK.

431
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,588
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR RACHEL.

432
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,089
RACHEL BUMP IT IS TRIP BAR,

433
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,549
LOSES NEARLY HER ENTIRE STACK.

437
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,471
>> Jeff: BUT SHE NOW KNOWS IT

438
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,555
WILL WORK.

439
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,681
MARISSA NOW FEELS THE PRESSURE.

440
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,557
>> YOU'RE GOOD.

441
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,224
TAKE YOUR TIME.

442
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:47,516
THIS IS IT.

443
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,851
I THINK THEY'RE GOOD.

444
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,729
>> Jeff: MARISSA RESTACKED.

445
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,188
SHE THINKS SHE HAS IT.

446
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,273
SHE TRIES AGAIN.

447
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,191
MARISSA IS NO GOOD.

SHE LOST A THIRD OF HER STACK

449
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,151

NOW THE PANIC STARTS TO SET IN.

456
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,164

SEVERAL SHOTS AT THIS.

463
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,142
>> THIS IS CRAZY.

464
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:30,851
>> Jeff: IT IS NECK IN NECK.

465
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,062
BOTH WOMEN JUST A COUPLE OF

466
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,356
BLOCKS AWAY FROM GOING AGAIN.

467
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,023
>> THIS IS INTENSE.

468
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,984
>> GERV, I'M ABOUT TO PASS OUT.

469
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,319

RACHEL HAS TO GET BACK TO

477
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,581
WITHOUT HURTING HER BARS.

478
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,375

00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,107
THAT MADE SENSE, REALLY, IF THEY

563
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,025
WANTED TO TRY AND WIN

564
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,443
CHALLENGES.

565
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,903
SO NOW I HAVE TO GET ALL THE WAY

566
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,614
TO THE END OR I WOULD REGRET NOT

567
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,199
STEPPING IN FOR RACHEL.

568
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,117
>> I THOUGHT YOU MADE THE RIGHT

569
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,159
DECISION, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

570
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,162
>> WHEN SHE LOST AND I GOT TO

571
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,831
HUG HER I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD

572
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,457
FUN AND SHE SAID SHE DID AND FOR

573
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,375
ME THAT WAS ENOUGH.

574
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,251
BECAUSE IT IS A GAME, YOU KNOW?

575
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,461
TOO MANY PEOPLE TAKE IT TOO

576
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,130
SERIOUS AND IT SHOULDN'T BE.

577
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,965
AND IT RUINS THEIR LIVES AND IT

578
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,383
MAKES THEM ANGRY AND A GOOD

579
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,135
EXAMPLE OF THAT IS COLTON.

580
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,721
>> WE'RE DOWN A MAN.

581
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,263
>> WHY'D HE QUIT?

582
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,597
LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED?

583
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,682
>> BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE

584
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,267
CONTROL OF ALL OF US.

585
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,184
LIKE, HE THOUGHT HE COULD.

586
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,895
>> BECAUSE EVERY PERSON HE

587
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,521
TALKED TO SAID "I DON'T WANT TO

588
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,107
TALK STRATEGY TO YOU" SO HE WAS

589
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,191
LIKE HOW CAN I PLAY THIS GAME?

590
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,444
AND RATHER THAN BIDE HIS TIME

591
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,945
AND WAIT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO

592
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:10,571
SOMETHING HE WAS LIKE "I QUIT."

593
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,115
>> I THINK I CAN ONLY REMEMBER

594
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,658
ALL THESE (BLEEP).

595
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,076
>> THAT WAS A STRONG ATTACK ON

596
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,454
THE CULPEPPER NAME.

597
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,747
>> RIGHT NOW BEING HERE WITH

598
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,289
MONICA IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

599
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,082
I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T BE BOTHERED

600
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,709
BY THAT.

601
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,334
I KNOW HER HUSBAND WAS THE MAIN

602
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,087
REASON RACHEL GOT VOTED OUT BUT

603
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,839
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE

604
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,048
GAME.

605
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,716
ALL HE'S DOING IS CREATING A

606
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,679
LARGER TARGET ON HIS BACK.

607
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,557
>> WELL, THAT WAS UNEVENTFUL.

608
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,433
>> WOW.

609
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,142
THAT'S CRAZY.

610
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,226
>> AM I BEING A TYRANT?

611
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,560
I DON'T KNOW.

612
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,687
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT.

613
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:43,979
DON'T WORRY.

614
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,105
>> HE CALLED ME OUT.

615
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,440
IT WAS LIKE -- THAT'S THE WHOLE

616
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,192
DEAL WITH GOING TO REDEMPTION

617
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:48,442
ISLAND.

618
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,401
IN THE PAST YOU VOTE SOMETHING

619
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,903
OFF AND THEIR DIRTY LAUNDRY GOES

620
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:51,236
WITH THEM.

621
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,987
>> EXACTLY.

622
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,447
>> NOW YOU VOTE SOMEBODY OFF AND

623
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,282
THE DIRTY LAUNDRY COMES BACK AT

624
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:55,783
YOU.

625
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,743
AT REDEMPTION WE WALK IN AND ALL

626
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,787
OF A SUDDEN WHAM!

627
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,329
TYSON STARTED BLAMING ME FOR

628
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,372
GETTING RID OF HIS GIRL.

629
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,166
THEN MARISSA DIRECTED

630
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,211
VULGARITIES ABOUT ME ABOUT ME

631
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,129
RULING THE ROOST AND MAKING THE

632
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:09,379
DECISIONS.

633
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,508
I AM BUT I'M MAKING EVERYONE

634
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,217
ELSE FEEL THAT DECISIONS ARE

635
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,637
BEING MADE AS A GROUP, NOT BY

636
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:16,929
ME.

637
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,097
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ME AT ALL.

638
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,724
>> HE'S A SOLID DUDE, MAN.

639
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,059
HE KNOWS HOW TO BUILD A TEAM.

640
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,310
>> EVERYBODY'S MUCH MORE

641
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,103
COMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF BRAD.

642
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,188
>> I LOVE ALL OF YOU GUYS.

643
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,232
IT'S LIKE WE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN

644
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:34,696
DROPPED IN A BETTER POSITION.

645
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,633
>> CANDICE KICKED ASS AGAIN AT

646
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,717
THE DUEL WHICH WAS GREAT FOR ME

647
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,511
BECAUSE I GOT ANOTHER CLUE TO

648
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,513
THE IMMUNITY IDOL AND IT'S SORT

649
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,474
OF A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD BECAUSE

650
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,851
EVERYONE WILL ASSUME I FOUND IT

651
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,519
SO I'LL HAVE A TARGET ON MY BACK

652
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,770
WHETHER I FIND IT OR NOT.

653
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,189
>> I FEEL BET WE ARE THE SECOND

654
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,234
CLUE THAN I DID ABOUT THE FIRST.

655
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,944
>> ORIGIN 23458LY I WASN'T GOING

656
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,570
TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THE CLUE

657
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,405
BUT I LIKE BRAD A LOT AND I

658
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,823
DIDN'T WANT HIM TO THINK I WAS

659
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,407
BEING SHADY AND START BEING

660
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:38,010
PARANOID ABOUT OUR ALLIANCE.

661
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,024
>> AT THIS POINT, I'VE GOT SUCH

662
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,817
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN HE

663
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,611
ACTUALLY TOLD ME THE CLUE TO THE

664
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,737
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND I

665
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,615
WANTED TO HELP HIM FIND IT BUT

666
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,908
JOHN SAID WE SHOULDN'T GO

667
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,534
TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

668
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,328
SEEM TOO OBVIOUS AND I'M

669
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,287
THINKING, HMM, OKAY, I DON'T

670
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,371
KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

671
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,664
DOES HE TRUST ME OR NOT?

672
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,707
>> I'LL FIND IT.

673
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,917
>> I AGREE.

674
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,584
YOU GO.

675
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,877
YOU'RE THE LEADER ON THIS DEAL.

676
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,461
>> LET ME FIND IT.

677
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,755
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A LITMUS

678
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,881
TEST WITH JOHN AND I.

679
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:16,798
IS JOHN WITH ME?

680
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,592
IS HE MY GUY OR IS HE NOT?

681
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,343
BECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T TRUST ME,

682
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:33,440
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST HIM.

683
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,775
>> Jeff: TREEMAIL!

684
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,150
>> TODAY?

685
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:35,734
>> OH, BOY.

686
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,069
>> A CHALLENGE?

687
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,530
>> PUSHING, SHOVING, THRASHING,

688
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:40,781
BASHING.

689
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,325
THIS IS NO REGULAR PILLOW FIGHT.

690
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,161
>> WE'RE FIGHTING!

691
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,704
>> KNOCK YOUR LOVED ONES IN THE

692
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,289
DRINK OR YOU MAY JUST GO HOME

693
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:53,502
TONIGHT.

694
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,630
>> WOW.

695
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,465
>> WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO GO

696
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:58,674
AGAINST?

697
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,760
>> I'D LIKE TO GO AGAINST VYTAS.

698
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,386
WE GET TREEMAIL AND THIS IS HUGE

699
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,388
BECAUSE MY BROTHER HAS BEEN A

700
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,682
BULLY IN MY LIFE, TO PUT IT

701
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:06,890
SIMPLY.

702
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,058
WHEN I WAS A KID, MY BROTHER

703
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,393
NEVER LOOKED OUT FOR ME.

704
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,978
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MOM'S NOT

705
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:11,520
LOOKING SO IF HE COULD GET A

706
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,147
PUNCH IN HE WAS GOING TO TAKE

707
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:14,314
IT.

708
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,607
BUT THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO

709
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:20,112
COMPETE ON AN EVEN PLAYING

710
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:20,320
FIELD.

711
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,905
>> I THINK ANY ADVICE YOU WOULD

712
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,114
HAVE?

713
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,074
>> DON'T GET OVEREXTENDED.

714
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:24,533
THE KEY IS BALANCE.

715
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:29,496
YES, YES, LIKE BOXING, LIKE PEW.

716
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,081
>> GO EASY ON ME.

717
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,833
>> I CAN'T SAY I WAS A GREAT

718
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,167
OLDER BROTHER TO ARAS BUT THE

719
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:34,710
TRUTH IS HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A

720
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,045
LITTLE MORE ATHLETIC, A LITTLE

721
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,922
STRONGER, A LITTLE BIGGER THAN

722
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,089
ME.

723
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,549
HE GOT BEST BODY IN HIGH SCHOOL,

724
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,634
COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP TO PLAY

725
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:42,926
BASKETBALL.

726
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,344
HE WAS -- HE'S THE GOLDEN CHILD.

727
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,387
HE ALWAYS WINS.

728
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,597
WON "SURVIVOR," WON A MILLION

729
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,599
DOLLARS AND I'M LIKE FINALLY FOR

730
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,810
ONCE CAN I WIN, PLEASE?

731
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,437
I'M GOING TO GO BALLS OUT.

732
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,479
I CAN'T GO HOME HAVING HIM BEAT

733
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,023
ME EVERY TIME.

734
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,357
>> ESPECIALLY IN A PHYSICAL

735
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:57,607
CHALLENGE.

736
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:57,858
>> YES!

737
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,317
THIS IS MY CHANCE.

738
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:06,450
I HAVE TO BEAT HIM AT SOMETHING.

739
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,620
>> Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET

740
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,330
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

741
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,248
>> ABSOLUTELY!

742
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:16,251
>> Jeff: FIRST THING'S FIRST,

743
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,419
GALANG, TAKE BACK THE IDOL.

744
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,838
>> GOOD TOSS!

745
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,757
>> ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK

746
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,924

YOU KNOW, I LOVE HIM MORE THAN

958
00:28:59,112 --> 00:28:59,362
ANYBODY ELSE.

959
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,030
HE'S MY BROTHER AND I DON'T WANT

960
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,324
TO FIGHT AGAINST HIM.

961
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,702
WE'VE DONE IT ENOUGH BUT -- I'M

962
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,536

963
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,705

ATHLETE.

965
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,331
I'M THE JUNKY.

966
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:10,957
I WAS SO HAPPY TO GO UP AGAINST

967
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,960

00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:14,752

WE ARE PLAYING TO FIVE.

972
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,259
THIS COULD BE IT.

973
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,094
LAURA WILL BE TAKING ON HER

974
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:23,470
DAUGHTER CIERA.

>> IT'S OKAY, RIGHT?

976
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,139
JUST A GAME.

977

IT'S OKAY.

978
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,932

>> THAT'S MY BABY.

984
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:37,859
AND TO HURT YOUR OWN CHILD

985
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,902
INTENTIONALLY IS NEVER FUN.

986
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,945

987
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,740

MEAN, THEY'RE A TEAM OF LIKE

1038
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,831
MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS.

1039
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:34,183
VERY, VERY FRUSTRATING.

1040
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:34,809
MY MOM TOTALLY KICKED MY ASS.

1041
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,520
>> I THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD

1042
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,480
VYTAS GO AGAINST TYSON.

1043
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,773
>> IT WAS CLOSE, THEY JUST --

1044
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,567
>> I FEEL LIKE IT WASN'T THAT

1045
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:42,775
CLOSE.

1046
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,235
I FEEL LIKE I GOT CLOBBERED BY

1047
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:44,527
MY BROTHER.

1048
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,237
I KNEW GOING INTO THAT CHALLENGE

1049
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,697
IF IT WAS GOING TO BE ME AGAINST

1050
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,948
ARAS THAT THE CARDS WERE STACKED

1051
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:49,490
AGAINST ME.

1052
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,116
I WANTED TO GO UP AGAINST HIM IN

1053
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,075
HOPES THAT MAYBE SOMETHING

1054
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,703
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE BALANCE OR

1055
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,329
MAYBE HE WASN'T EATING AS MUCH

1056
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,581
AS I HAD BEEN BUT NOT ONLY DID

1057
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,750
HE WIN BUT HE WON EVEN AFTER I

1058
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:06,174
GAVE HIM A CHEAP SHOT.

1059
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,968
>> WE'RE GETTING OUR ASSES

1060
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:09,177
KICKED.

1061
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,137
>> I LIKE OLD GIRLS BUT NEITHER

1062
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,097
ONE OF THEM COULD BEAT THEIR

1063
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:13,264
MOM.

1064
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,599
KATIE COULDN'T BEAT HER

1065
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,516
60-YEAR-OLD MOTHER AND.

1066
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,184
>> AND SHE'S GIGGLING.

1067
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,101
ARE YOU KIDDING HE?

1068
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,937
DO YOU KNOW THERE'S A 50% CHANCE

1069
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,480
YOU'RE GOING HOME TONIGHT?

1070
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,981
>> TADHANA'S LOST THREE STRAIGHT

1071
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,609
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES AND IT'S

1072
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,234
FRUSTRATING AND NOW IT'S LIKE WE

1073
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,195
GOT THESE TWO GIRLS WHO I LIKE

1074
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,071
VERY MUCH BUT, LIKE, IF WE'RE

1075
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,948
GOING TO WIN CHALLENGES WE CAN'T

1076
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,492
HAVE PEOPLE LIKE GIGGLING AND

1077
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,160
LAUGHING AS WE'RE LOSING.

1078
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,453
IT'S COMPLETELY ASININE.

1079
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,038
HERE'S THE THING, KATIE HAS

1080
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,915
COOKED EVERY SINGLE MEAL.

1081
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,666
>> THAT'S TRUE.

1082
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,333
>> THAT'S TRUE.

1083
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,001
>> CIERA HASN'T DONE ANYTHING AT

1084
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,670
ANY CHALLENGE AND SHE DOESN'T DO

1085
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,295
ANYTHING AROUND CAMP SO TO ME I

1086
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,172
DON'T THINK SHE'S HELPING US

1087
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:46,422
THAT MUCH.

1088
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,174
>> I'M DOWN TO GO WITH WHATEVER.

1089
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,634
IF IT'S CIERA FINE.

1090
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,219
>> I WANT IT TO BE DONE AND

1091
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,136
LET'S ENJOY THE AFTERNOON AS

1092
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,428
BEST WE CAN.

1093
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,097
>> WE HAVE THE FIVE-GUY ALLIANCE

1094
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,641
SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT

1095
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:56,891
TONIGHT.

1096
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:57,433
IT'S GOING TO BE CIERA GOING

1097
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,227
HOME BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

1098
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,061
BECAUSE THIS IS "SURVIVOR" SUR

1099
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,064
SO I HAVE TWO CLUES TO A HIDDEN

1100
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,441
IMMUNITY IDOL AND IF I CAN FIND

1101
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,067
THE THING I'LL PUT MYSELF IN A

1102
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,318
GOOD POSITION.

1103
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,738
>> LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL: JOHN,

1104
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,115
HE'S A STRONG PLAYER, HE NEEDS

1105
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:12,323
TO GO.

1106
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,867
BECAUSE JOHN CAN RECONNECT WITH

1107
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,077
CANDICE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO

1108
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,621
HAVE THOSE TWO BACK IN THE GAME.

1109
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,706
COMING BACK FROM THE CHALLENGE

1110
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,207
MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE CHANGED.

1111
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,502
THAT'S WHEN THE LIGHTBULB WENT

1112
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:24,711
BING.

1113
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,504
HERE'S THE DEAL: I'M RUNNING OUR

1114
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,589
TRIBE RIGHT NOW BUT JOHN'S WIFE

1115
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,633
CANDICE IS KICKING IT AT

1116
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,260
REDEMPTION ISLAND AND LET'S SAY

1117
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,678
SHE GETS BACK IN THE GAME.

1118
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,972
IF WE GO TO A MERGE AND THEY'RE

1119
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:36,889
RECONNECTED, BRAD DOESN'T

1120
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,474
CONTROL JOHN ANYMORE, CANDICE

1121
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,600
CONTROLS JOHN.

1122
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,185
AND I'M JUST KICKED TO THE CURB

1123
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,311
AND I'M SECOND FIDDLE.

1124
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,563
>> THE GIRLS WILL BE FIGHTING

1125
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,480
FOR THEIR OWN LIVES.

1126
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,232
I PROMISE YOU THEY'LL BE ON

1127
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:46,441
BOARD.

1128
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,150
IT WILL BE ONE OF THE COLOSSAL

1129
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,694
BLIND SIDES ON "SURVIVOR"

1130
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:49,944
HISTORY.

1131
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,028
I'M JUST TELLING YOU.

1132
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,488
>> WE'VE BEEN STICKING TO THE

1133
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,073
FIVE GUYS ALLIANCE AND SUDDENLY

1134
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,742
BRAD IS LIKE, BOOM, WE'RE GOING

1135
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,160
TO GET RID OF JOHN RIGHT NOW.

1136
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,411
BIG MOVE.

1137
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,954
AND I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED.

1138
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,623
>> HE'S NOT FINDING THE IDOL

1139
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:02,790
TODAY.

1140
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,041
>> WHAT'S THE SECOND CLUE?

1141
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,754
>> YEAH IT'S LIKE SERPENTINE

1142
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,213
TREE ON THE WAY TO THE WATERFALL

1143
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,048
AND YOU HAVE TO DIG FOR IT.

1144
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,717
>> IT'S BEEN FIVE GUYS SINCE DAY

1145
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,218
ONE AND IF WE'RE VOTING ONE OUT

1146
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,762
NOW IT COULD BE LIKE OPENING

1147
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,179
PANDORA'S BOX.

1148
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,638
IT COULD REALLY BUILD DISTRUST

1149
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,809
MOVING FORWARD.

1150
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,519
>> THERE HE IS WALKING.

1151
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,104
HERE'S THE DEAL, WE'RE GOING

1152
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,773
UNIFIED ON JOHN.

1153
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,982
WE HAVE TO PULL THIS OFF.

1154
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,734
BECAUSE HERE'S THE BRUTAL TRUTH:

1155
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,360
IF IT'S NOT JOHN IT'S GOT TO BE

1156
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,487
ONE OF YOU GUYS.

1157
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,154
ALL RIGHT?

1158
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,574
CALL ME CRAZY, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT

1159
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:36,783
THIS.

1160
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,535
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, I MAY VOTE

1161
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,246
YOU SO THAT IF JOHN GETS BACK IN

1162
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,165
THE GAME I CAN MAYBE PULL HIM

1163
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,458
BACK IN.

1164
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,167
>> SO BRAD MENTIONS HE WANTS TO

1165
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,419
BE THE ONE GUY THAT DOESN'T VOTE

1166
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,004
FOR JOHN AND I'M NOT DOWN WITH

1167
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:50,171
IT.

1168
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,506
IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A MOVE

1169
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,173
LIKE THIS, WE HAVE TO SUCK IT UP

1170
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,175
AND DO IT AND SAY WE DID IT

1171
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,176
TOGETHER AND BRAD DOESN'T WANT

1172
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,969
TO BE THE BAD GUY.

1173
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:57,553
HE ORCHESTRATED IT ALL BUT HE

1174
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,722
WANTS US TO DO THE DIRTY WORK

1175
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,348
WHICH MAKES BRAD A BIG TARGET IN

1176
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:05,728
MY EYES TO SEE THAT LEVEL OF

1177
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,022
SHIESTINESS.

1178
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,733
>> I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE

1179
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:10,942
IDOL.

1180
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,485
LIKE, I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ALL

1181
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,238
VOTING JOHN BUT I'M SO PARANOID.

1182
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,248
>> I THINK IT MIGHT BE SMART.

1183
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:25,540
>> MIGHT BE.

1184
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,084
>> OH, MY GOD, CAN YOU IMAGINE?

1185
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:28,751
OH, MY GOD.

1186
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,377
>> I FEEL LIKE EVERY TRIBAL SO

1187
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,796
FAR I'VE BEEN ON THE CHOPPING

1188
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,256
BLOCK SO IF THE BOYS ARE WILLING

1189
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,382
TO VOTE OUT BRAD I WOULD

1190
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,884
DEFINITELY DO THE SAME.

1191
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,510
I'VE ALWAYS SAID ANYBODY BUT ME.

1192
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,137
I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS.

1193
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,973
>> YEAH, BUT DO WE WANT TO RISK

1194
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,391
KEEPING SOMEBODY AROUND IF HE

1195
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,768
ACTUALLY DOES HAVE THE IDOL?

1196
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,104
>> THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING

1197
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:48,271
ON.

1198
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,523
BRAD THINKS JOHN IS A THREAT.

1199
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,399
BUT NOW I'M STARTING TO THINK

1200
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,276
BRAD'S EQUALLY DANGEROUS.

1201
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,611
SO TONIGHT IS A HUGE DECISION

1202
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,198
FOR US AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

1203
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,157
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1204
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,826
ONE THING'S FOR SURE: IT'S GOING

1205
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:06,289
TO BE A BIG BLIND SIDE.

1206
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,561
>> Jeff: JOHN, THIRD TIME IN A

1207
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:28,728
ROW.

1208
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,312
>> THIRD TIME IN A ROW, JEFF.

1209
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,480
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT

1210
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:31,898
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

1211
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,608
ONCE AGAIN THE MEN WERE THE ONLY

1212
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,318
PEOPLE WHO REALLY SCORED ANY

1213
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:35,568
POINTS.

1214
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,694
WAS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS

1215
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,987
TALKED ABOUT WHEN YOU WENT BACK

1216
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,487
TO CAMP?

1217
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,238
>> OF COURSE.

1218
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,656
WE KNEW THAT THE BRAWN OF THE

1219
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,365
MEN IN OUR TEAM WAS ONE OF OUR

1220
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,451
STRONG POINTS BUT, YOU KNOW,

1221
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,368
THAT WAS A CHALLENGE ABOUT

1222
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:44,619
MATCHUPS.

1223
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,287
EVERYONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO COME

1224
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,455
TO THE CABLE AND WIN THEIR

1225
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:47,705
MATCHUP.

1226
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,790
>> Jeff: KATIE, FIRST TIME YOU

1227
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,292
WENT UP AGAINST YOUR MOM YOU

1228
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:51,459
LOST.

1229
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,460
TODAY YOU GO UP AGAINST YOUR

1230
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,961
MOM, LOSE AGAIN.

1231
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,712
>> YEAH.

1232
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,172
AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE

1233
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:56,797
THERE'S ONLY TWO FEMALES SO WE

1234
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,716
HAVE TO GO IN SEVERAL TIMES AND

1235
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,468
IT WAS FRUSTRATING, DEFINITELY.

1236
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,428
>> Jeff: CIERA, HOW ABOUT FOR

1237
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:02,595
YOU?

1238
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,181
>> YEAH.

1239
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:05,890
THAT WAS ROUGH.

1240
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,558
I MEAN, IF I COULD JUST WIN ONE

1241
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,518
AND KATIE COULD JUST WIN ONE WE

1242
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,645
DEFINITELY HAD A CHANCE AT

1243
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,479
WINNING THE THING SO, YEAH,

1244
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,314
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED BECAUSE YOU

1245
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,815
LOST TO YOUR MOM AND NOT ONLY

1246
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,483
THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU LET YOUR

1247
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,778
TEAM DOWN.

1248
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,529
>> Jeff: CALEB, THREE VOTES,

1249
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,530
THREE WOMEN GONE FROM THIS

1250
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:21,739
TRIBE.

1251
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,699
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THIS

1252
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:23,908
TRIBE?

1253
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,326
>> MALES PRETTY MUCH DOMINATE

1254
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:25,493
IT.

1255
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,452
IF WE LOSE AND COME HERE IT'S

1256
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,163
USUALLY GOING TO BE A GIRL GOING

1257
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:29,330
HOME.

1258
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,500
>> Jeff: VYTAS, IS IT A MALE

1259
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,751
ALLIANCE OR THE FACT THAT WE

1260
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,044
THINK WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF THE

1261
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:35,670
THREE WEAKEST PEOPLE AND THAT'S

1262
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,546
WHY THERE HAVE BEEN WOMEN SO

1263
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:37,797
FAR?

1264
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,506
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE AS

1265
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,841
RUDIMENTARY AS MEN VERSUS WOMEN.

1266
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,467
I THINK TRUST IS THE CURRENCY OF

1267
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,260
THIS GAME, JEFF.

1268
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,179
TRUST AND INFORMATION.

1269
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:46,555
ANYTHING SOMEBODY SAYS OR DOES

1270
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,974
JUST ADDS TO THE INFORMATION YOU

1271
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,433
GET ABOUT THAT PERSON.

1272
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,853
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER, VIE

1273
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,355
SRAO ++EU IT IS A BASICALLY SAID

1274
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,314
WHEN YOU SAY ANYTHING THAT COULD

1275
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,067
BE USED AGAINST YOU IN THIS

1276
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,275
GAME.

1277
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:58,859
DOES THAT CONCERN YOU A BIT?

1278
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,486
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

1279
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,362
AT THE END OF THE DAY I GUESS

1280
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,405
I'M SENSITIVE BECAUSE EVERY TIME

1281
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,490
GO TO REDEMPTION ISLAND I'M TO

1282
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,367
BLAME FOR WHOMEVER IS THERE AND

1283
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,327
FOR WHATEVER REASON PEOPLE SEEM

1284
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,620
TO THINK I WAS THE KINGPIN OF

1285
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,080
THIS GROUP WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE

1286
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,915
I AM BUT THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION

1287
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,710
AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY

1288
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:15,960
DIFFICULT.

1289
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,586
>> Jeff: JOHN, BRAD BRINGS UP

1290
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,546
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1291
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,380
ONCE AGAIN, CANDICE, YOUR WIFE,

1292
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,008
GAVE YOU ANOTHER CLUE TO THE

1293
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,259
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND SHE

1294
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,885
SAID "I'M GOING TO TRUST MY

1295
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,429
HUSBAND KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH

1296
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:26,637
THIS."

1297
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,180
WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY THAT, DO

1298
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:28,681
YOU THINK?

1299
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,433
>> CANDICE IS A STUDENT OF THE

1300
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:30,641
GAME.

1301
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,767
SHE KNOWS THAT GIVING ME THE

1302
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,561
CLUES SO PUBLICLY PUTS A BIG

1303
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,021
TARGET ON MY BACK WHETHER I HAVE

1304
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,105
THE IDOL OR NOT.

1305
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,398
SO I THINK SHE'S TRUSTING THAT

1306
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,733
I'VE PUT MYSELF IN A GOOD

1307
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,692
POSITION IN THE GAME AND THEN

1308
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,485
KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT IF THE

1309
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,320
TIME COMES.

1310
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,239
>> Jeff: VYTAS, DO YOU WISH IT

1311
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,615
WAS YOU THAT HAD THE CLUES TO

1312
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,284
THE IDOL OR ARE YOU GLAD IT'S

1313
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:48,617
SOMEBODY ELSE?

1314
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,286
>> I THINK IT'S TOUGH, JEFF.

1315
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,454
IT CAN DEFINITELY HELP YOUR

1316
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,913
ALLIANCE AND HELP US GO FURTHER

1317
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,248
BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS

1318
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,000
GAME KNOWS THAT JOHN HAS THOSE

1319
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,335
TWO CLUES, YOU KNOW?

1320
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,961
SO AT THIS POINT I'M HAPPY

1321
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,546
SOMEBODY IN MY ALLIANCE HAS IT

1322
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,381
BUT I'M ALSO HAPPY IT'S NOT ME.

1323
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,550
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, WHAT ARE THE

1324
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,969
CHANCES THAT WITH TWO CLUES HE

1325
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:07,553
DOESN'T HAVE IT?

1326
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,596
>> (LAUGHS)

1327
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,139
IT DEPENDS ON THE CLUES, JEFF.

1328
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,557
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CLUES MYSELF

1329
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,184
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW PRECISE THEY

1330
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:13,350
ARE.

1331
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,643
>> Jeff: SO HE HASN'T SHARED

1332
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:14,977
THEM WITH YOU?

1333
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,021
>> HE HAS NOT SHARED THEM WITH

1334
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:17,355
ME.

1335
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:17,521
NO.

1336
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,355
>> Jeff: DOES THAT MAKE YOU

1337
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,273
QUESTION A LITTLE?

1338
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,691
>> A LITTLE BIT IN THE BACK OF

1339
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,609
YOUR MIND, OF COURSE.

1340
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,610
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S

1341
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,946
-- I'VE GOT TO TAKE HIS WORD.

1342
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,614
>> ANOTHER THING THAT'S TOUGH,

1343
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,824
JEFF, IS THAT WE CAN'T ALL TELL

1344
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,950
THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME.

1345
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,202
AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO FIGURE

1346
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,454
OUT HOW TO MOVE AHEAD TO BETTER

1347
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:33,704
OURSELVES.

1348
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,206
I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY GOING TO BE

1349
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,582
ONE WINNER AT THE END OF THE

1350
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,919
DAY.

1351
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:40,711
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1352
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:41,587
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1353
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,175
KATIE, YOU'RE UP.

1354
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,723
VOTES.

1355
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,725
IF ANYBODY THAT HAS HIDDEN

1356
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,643
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1357
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,478
PLAY IT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO

1358
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:44,233
DO SO.

1359
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,609
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1360
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,527
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1361
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,653
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1362
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,572
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1363
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,156
IMMEDIATELY.

1364
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,032
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1365
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,494
FIRST VOTE: CIERA.

1366
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,707
JOHN.

1367
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,666
JOHN.

1368
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:06,422
TWO VOTES JOHN.

1369
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,173
JOHN.

1370
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,425
THAT'S THREE VOTES JOHN, ONE

1371
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,720
VOTE CIERA.

1372
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:17,349
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1373
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:17,892
"SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS. WATER,"

1374
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,309
JOHN, THAT'S FOUR.

1375
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:31,989
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1376
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:36,493
JOHN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1377
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,077
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

1378
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:37,661
BACK IN THIS GAME.

1379
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,997
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD TO

1380
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,581
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1381
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:45,211
GOOD LUCK.

1382
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,176
>> Jeff: WELL, BASED ON

1383
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:52,801
TONIGHT'S BLIND SIDE IT APPEARS

1384
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,720
YOU'RE VOTING PEOPLE OUT BASED

1385
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,638
ON THE FUTURE.

1386
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,598
IT ALSO APPEARS THAT WITH EACH

1387
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,934
VOTE THE TRIBE IS GETTING

1388
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,184
WEAKER.

1389
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,685
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1390
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:01,894
CAMP.

1391
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,898

>> I'VE BEEN A TARGET MY WHOLE

1400

LIFE.

1401
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,290
THIS IS NOTHING NEW.

1402

CONTROL OF THE GAME.

1405
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,088
IT'S NATURAL FOR ME TO LEAD MY

1406
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:29,296
FAMILY.

1407
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,422

DRIVER'S SEAT TO THE HOT SEAT.

1409
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:33,926

1410
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:34,593
>> YOU FELL ABOUT THIS SMALL.

1411
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,637
>> ASK JOHN!

1412
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,263
ASK JOHN!

1413
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,639
>> YOU'RE A CHILD.

1414
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,891
>> KNEW NO CLUE THAT WAS COMING

1415
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,060
TOGETHER.

1416
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,020

1417
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,230
YEAH.

1418
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,273

1419
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,066
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1420
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,401
I FEEL LIKE THERE WAS SO MUCH

1421
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,777
WOOL PULLED OVER MY EYES AND I

1422
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,654
BOUGHT IT HOOK, LINE, AND

1423
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:53,862
SINKER.

1424
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,073
