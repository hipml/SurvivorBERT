2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,139
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:05,944
Throw away your bandanas.

4
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:07,720
After a surprise change,

5
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:10,266
Muscle, Intelligence 
and Beauty were gone.

6
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:12,394
They were divided into two tribes,

7
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:15,236
the new Solana tribe 
and the new Aparri tribe.

8
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:18,127
I am the only 
original Aparri in the tribe,

9
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:21,239
with three members of Intelligence 
and three of Beauty.

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,370
Chez Aparri ...

11
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:24,603
Our sweet home!

12
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:27,268
The former Beauty members 
began to split.

13
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:30,659
At first, Jeremiah was with us, 
then he switched sides, and switched again.

14
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:33,594
LJ and Alexis cuddle 
every night.

15
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:34,792
Are you and Alexis friends?

16
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:36,178
We were at the start.

17
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:37,868
LJ, her and I, we were like that.

18
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:40,901
And the elders of Intelligence 
took advantage of this to take control.

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,755
The fact that they're so divided

20
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,705
shows that they can be played 
against each other.

21
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:46,418
While in Solana...

22
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:48,118
What a beautiful shelter!

23
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:50,544
Former 
Muscle members relished

24
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:52,944
a 5 to 2 advantage 
over LJ and Jefra.

25
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:55,460
If we continue with the people we have,

26
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:56,657
we are in a very good position.

27
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:58,700
But they could not 
settle all the quarrels.

28
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,948
Trish makes me sick.

29
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:03,517
You're 50, stop trying to get 
the attention of 20-year-old men.

30
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:06,911
And at the last immunity test...

31
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,012
Big win for the underdogs!

32
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:10,282
Solana destroys.

33
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:11,582
How it happened?

34
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:17,618
As the board approached, 
the Muscle alumni took aim at LJ.

35
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,973
The four of us will vote for LJ.

36
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:21,617
- First? 
- Light!

37
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:25,518
But Trish and Tony saw it as a chance 
to eliminate a much bigger threat.

38
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:27,432
Cliff is very influential,

39
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:29,193
which makes it very dangerous.

40
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,893
And at tribal council, 
Trish and Tony's wish was granted.

41
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:37,345
Cliff and his allies 
were taken by surprise.

42
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,754
Cliff, the tribe has spoken.

43
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:44,594
There are thirteen left, 
who will be eliminated tonight?

44
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:05,131
I would just like to 
clarify some points,

45
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,272
because I think 
it's really important,

46
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,350
I mean, Lindsey, I...

47
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:11,440
- Stop it, Trish. 
- I'm talking.

48
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,636
- Come back down to Earth, Trish. 
- Excuse me, I'm talking.

49
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,822
We took Cliff 
completely by surprise.

50
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,323
He was so sure he was 
n't leaving tonight.

51
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:20,531
You completely screwed up.

52
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:22,444
And who do you think you're allied with?

53
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:25,568
- I'm out of wedding rings. 
- No, indeed.

54
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:29,114
His alliance 
was Lindsey and Cliff, period.

55
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:30,992
We got rid of Cliff 
and she finds herself alone.

56
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:33,329
- Let me explain to you. 
- OK.

57
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:36,997
In the future, I will respect you, 
because this team is moving forward.

58
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:37,854
But I don't love you.

59
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,415
You know what? You disgust me.

60
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,388
Everything about you is annoying.

61
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:43,854
Your laughter, your teeth, your face...

62
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,876
Everything you are, 
I can't stand it.

63
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:47,900
So why not step 
back a little bit,

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,690
shut up, and don't 
talk to me for a while?

65
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:52,775
So you're telling us 
you're not on the team?

66
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:56,486
I'm not on your team, 
I never will be.

67
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:00,278
You're annoying, scary, 
and maybe the worst person

68
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:03,246
- that I have ever met. 
- Do you find me annoying?

69
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:05,002
- Yes I think so. 
- OK.

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,754
Now 
ask me if I'm interested.

71
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,678
I don't care if you're interested.

72
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:14,719
It's the best. I can leave 
and never think about you again.

73
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,149
Alright, that's enough. It's finish.

74
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,559
We all know what 
to expect now.

75
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,718
Let's just try to live 
with it, that's all.

76
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:26,818
Trish started 
to take it out on me.

77
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:30,493
She is tyrannical, and she has 
her mouth in the ass of a horse.

78
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,382
And emotionally, I'm 
not sure I can handle it.

79
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:37,154
- I can't stay in the same... 
- I'm sorry Cliff left.

80
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,113
I know you will miss him. 
And I'm sorry about that.

81
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:42,872
I don't want to 
play this with Trish.

82
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,715
So I'll take 
what's left of my sanity,

83
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:50,179
and I'll have to figure 
out what to do next,

84
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:54,881
because I won't do that, 
I won't stay near his mouth.

85
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:56,914
Yo, we have no idea 
where Lindsey is, man.

86
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,085
And it's cold, and it's night.

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,238
I hope she's okay, man.

88
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:01,941
I hope she 
's just licking her wounds.

89
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:03,667
She's not used 
to being in the cold like this.

90
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:22,748
- Hey, Lindsey. 
- Hi.

91
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:24,615
I was told you wanted to talk.

92
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:27,362
What is happening?

93
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,571
As soon as we got back to camp,

94
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,435
Trish got wild on me

95
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,383
with his dirty mouth.

96
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:37,709
What was she telling you?

97
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:40,530
Horrible and ridiculous things.

98
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:43,113
I can't live like this anymore.

99
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:47,954
At this point, I can't let 
anyone upset me that much.

100
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:51,605
- What do you think will happen? 
- I'm going to fall on him.

101
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:55,495
That's why 
I walked away.

102
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:58,750
I'd rather give up 
the million dollars

103
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:01,650
I'd rather my daughter see 
me behaving like that.

104
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:04,941
So it's just 
between you and Trish.

105
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:06,714
It's just a clash of personalities.

106
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,003
But it's so extreme...

107
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:12,646
and I'm cold, I'm wet, I'm hungry, 
I know it, and I'm tired.

108
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:16,169
I realize it, and I know 
I'm going to regret it.

109
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:18,717
I need the million 
more than anyone here.

110
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,338
But I can honestly say 
I can't take it anymore.

111
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:23,217
Are you giving up?

112
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,848
I don't know what else to do.

113
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,739
I have to say this is a first.

114
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,944
No one has ever 
given up out of fear

115
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:34,283
to do something 
he might regret,

116
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:38,733
and after reflection, decided 
it was best to retire.

117
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,859
It makes me really sad.

118
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:45,024
It was hard for me.

119
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,478
What was the hardest?

120
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:51,998
When I leave this beach, 
it will be the hardest moment.

121
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,206
How should 
the tribe be notified?

122
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:58,905
I would like to act responsibly 
and explain my departure to them,

123
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,417
but it would be better 
if I stayed a little here,

124
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,017
out of politeness, then I leave.

125
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:18,848
Hello everyone.

126
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:20,961
Oh, it's Jeff.

127
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:22,887
- Everyone awake? 
- Yes.

128
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:26,269
I have information 
to give you.

129
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:28,796
Lindsey was gone, 
was everything okay?

130
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,450
She left in her underwear, 
and even though I don't like her,

131
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't want her to get hurt.

132
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,843
I still care about her.

133
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,979
I'm just here to 
officially inform you

134
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:42,877
that after losing Cliff, 
which was apparently a surprise,

135
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:45,628
Lindsey retires from the game.

136
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:48,469
I feel bad, 
because I took it out on her,

137
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:50,081
but she has become 
disagreeable, mean.

138
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:52,864
Then she left, 
and I'm not surprised

139
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,071
that she gives up, as she 
cannot live without Cliff.

140
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:56,727
As expected.

141
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,101
Turn your head, the body will follow.

142
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,895
She was the body and Cliff the head.

143
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,739
She followed him to the exit.

144
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,357
That's wonderful.

145
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,732
Two for the price of one.

146
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:12,369
It was an explosive situation,

147
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:14,730
unstable, and when it popped...

148
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,151
Now we're cool.

149
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,781
It's as if we could 
start off on the right foot.

150
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:22,177
Here we are, the five solids.

151
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:27,493
Before the council, I was allied 
with Cliff and Lindsey.

152
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,193
That they are gone

153
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,203
puts me in an awkward position.

154
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:37,569
If we go to tribal council, 
I could totally see myself leaving.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,900
Survivor - Season 28 Episode 6 
We Found Our Zombies

156
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:13,181
Over here, everyone!

157
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:25,153
Aparri, discover 
the new Solana tribe.

158
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,318
Cliff was eliminated 
at last night's council.

159
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,502
A few hours later, 
Lindsey gave up.

160
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,297
- What? 
- My God.

161
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:38,528
She retired from the game 
for personal reasons.

162
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,988
Sarah, you can't 
help yourself.

163
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:45,681
Oh my God!

164
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,724
This is... insane.

165
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,294
Alexis, I'm surprised 
by the reaction, what's up?

166
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:54,957
I'm glad to see... 
our beauties still standing.

167
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,756
I'm happy, of course.

168
00:08:57,062 --> 00:09:00,317
Spencer, you nod. "It's good. 
Good news, yeah. I love it."

169
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,959
Two people left 
without me having to do anything.

170
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,507
It bothers me that someone gives up,

171
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:08,222
I really don't like it, 
but I'll take it.

172
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,958
My chances improved 
and I didn't have to do anything.

173
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:14,527
And here is the Solana tribe 
reduced to five members.

174
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,118
Aparri en a 7.

175
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,077
And the game has changed 
again.

176
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:23,011
- Ready for today's challenge? 
- Yes.

177
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,829
Today you will 
face each other one on one.

178
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:27,699
Each will carry an idol.

179
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:29,627
Knock down 
the opponent's idol

180
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,527
before he 
drops yours.

181
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:34,871
If you succeed, you score 
a point for your tribe.

182
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:37,290
The first team to four 
wins the reward.

183
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,345
- Want to know what's at stake? 
- Yes.

184
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:44,419
Two members of the winning tribe will 
accompany the losers

185
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:45,983
and plunder their camp.

186
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,023
This is an opportunity 
to improve your camp life

187
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:53,533
- and inflict heavy damage. 
- We must not be looted.

188
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,119
Aparri, you are two more, 
two will not participate.

189
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:58,889
It can't be the same 
twice in a row.

190
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:01,158
Who will not participate? 
Alexis and Kass.

191
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,777
Take a seat on the bench. The others, 
a minute to get organized.

192
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:04,833
And we'll start.

193
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:11,322
Let's go!

194
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:13,365
Man against man.

195
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:16,470
Spencer launches against Woo.

196
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:17,551
Go-y, Woo!

197
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:18,680
It is very simple.

198
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:20,685
Take down his idol before 
he takes down yours,

199
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,085
and you score a point.

200
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:24,551
- We play in 4 points. 
- Go ahead, Spence!

201
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,054
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

202
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:32,005
- Go ahead, Spence! 
- Take it easy, Woo.

203
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,705
Woo smiles, provoking Spencer!

204
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,983
You got it, Woo. 
Use your focus. Ninja!

205
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,934
It's a duel at the top.

206
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:41,060
Who will attack first?

207
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:45,439
Spencer closes in, 
provoking Woo in turn!

208
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:47,142
Keep the balance, Woo!

209
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:51,620
Spencer gives it a shot and succeeds!

210
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,414
Aparri scores and leads 1 to 0!

211
00:10:55,307 --> 00:10:56,692
Well done, Spencer.

212
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:02,444
Next round. 
It's Trish, for Solana,

213
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,546
against Tasha, for Aparri.

214
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:05,591
Survivors, ready?

215
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:08,527
- Go-y Tasha. 
- Allez, Tasha.

216
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,277
Are you going to play 
aggressive or defensive?

217
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,285
- Tasha launches. 
- Go-y Tasha.

218
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:15,234
Can we hit each other?

219
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:19,125
Trish pushes her away like a bug.

220
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:20,980
Don't hit her too hard, Trish.

221
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,128
Tasha rushes at her.

222
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:25,893
Tasha goes for a big shot, 
but misses!

223
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,256
Trish scores for Solana.

224
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:31,156
Tied, 1-1.

225
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:37,992
Sarah against Jefra.

226
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,686
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

227
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:40,508
Go!

228
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:45,138
Sarah rushes at Jefra.

229
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:46,582
It's okay, my sister.

230
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:48,895
- It's very aggressive. 
- Keep the balance!

231
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:51,325
She can't reach it, 
Jefra protects her. Nope!

232
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:55,020
Sarah succeeds. 
Aparri scores and leads.

233
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,615
Appearance 2, Solana

234
00:11:57,674 --> 00:11:58,883
Next round.

235
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:02,864
Jeremiah versus LJ.

236
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:04,005
Go ahead, LJ.

237
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,307
Confrontation of bearded mountaineers.

238
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:07,516
You'll get it, Jeremiah.

239
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:09,970
Aparri leads 2-1, we play in 4.

240
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:10,736
Go LJ!

241
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:12,016
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

242
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:14,681
Come on, Jeremiah!

243
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,043
LJ would like to equalize.

244
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:17,793
Come on, Jeremiah!

245
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:21,360
Lots of action.

246
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:22,663
You got it, you got it!

247
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:25,187
He tries to recover 
but Jeremiah can't!

248
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,230
Solana score!

249
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,602
Tied, 2-2.

250
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,752
The next round will be mixed.

251
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:35,664
Morgan will face Tony.

252
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:36,827
Come on, buddy.

253
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,695
An inequality due 
to the division of the tribes.

254
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,374
- You'll get there, Morgan. 
- Come on, Morgan.

255
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,441
Don't look her 
in the eye, bro.

256
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,624
Because you're going to be distracted?

257
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,525
- Directly. 
- Lord.

258
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:48,617
Let's go.

259
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:50,754
2-2, we play in 4.

260
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:51,823
Survivors, ready?

261
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,627
Tony against Morgan, he goes after her.

262
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:59,047
Morgan charges at him, 
but Morgan lets go first.

263
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,593
Solana scores and leads 3-2.

264
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,971
We go back to the beginning. 
We replay the first game.

265
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,545
- Come on, Spencer. 
- This could be the end.

266
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:10,822
- Come on, Woo. 
- Spencer and Woo.

267
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:11,953
Come on, Wooo.

268
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:14,007
Woo could bring 
victory to Solana.

269
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:16,297
- Keep the distance. 
- Spencer must win,

270
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:18,763
for Aparri to remain competitive.

271
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,351
Spencer won the first time.

272
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:25,159
We can go visit 
our old tribe.

273
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:28,371
- Feed the family, kid. 
- Come on Spence, we can't lose.

274
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:29,839
Survivors, ready?

275
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:33,737
Go!

276
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,627
You'll get it, Spencer.

277
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,847
Woo goes straight for Spencer.

278
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,773
Spencer has a great reach.

279
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,781
- In style, Woo. 
- Woo don't move.

280
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,539
It's getting closer.

281
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,102
There you are, Woo. Unbalance it.

282
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,475
Keep your feet moving, Woo.

283
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:52,049
Unbalance it, Woo. So!

284
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,139
Nice move from Woo, 
but Spencer hangs on.

285
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:56,338
- You got it, Spencer. 
- Let him come.

286
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,721
Spencer doesn't back down.

287
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,658
Another duel at the top 
between these two.

288
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,326
It's okay, Woo.

289
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:14,376
Woo go for it and succeed! 
Solana wins the reward!

290
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:28,393
Solana, congratulations.

291
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,730
You will choose two people

292
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,100
who will accompany Aparri 
to their camp.

293
00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:35,743
Who are you going to choose?

294
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,093
OK. Here is a message.

295
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,709
Don't open it until 
you're at their beach.

296
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:45,257
Then read it together, 
apart.

297
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:46,619
It will tell you what to do.

298
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:48,327
- OK? 
- Very well.

299
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:50,535
Tony, Woo, join this tribe.

300
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,167
See you soon!

301
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:59,121
Tony, you have a very good 
idea of ​​what Aparri has.

302
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:01,645
I know Aparri like the back of my hand, 
Jeff, that's why I'm going.

303
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,015
Trish, Jefra, LJ, get 
your things and head back to camp.

304
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:09,303
And wait 
for your companions to return with their loot.

305
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,852
Take your things. Go for it.

306
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,224
The afternoon 
should be interesting.

307
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:19,404
There's so much more energy at camp 
since Cliff and Lindsey left.

308
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:23,008
We showed them that we are 
in the minority, but that we have morals.

309
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,805
They saw it, and we won.

310
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:41,422
We lost 
the reward trial,

311
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:46,083
and today 
the reward is plunder.

312
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:50,240
So when Tony and Woo came, 
our hearts stopped.

313
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:53,316
Welcome to the house.

314
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:55,442
Thanks thanks.

315
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:58,940
Like Jeff said, we'll 
read that over there and come back.

316
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:00,114
OK.

317
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:04,118
I come from Luzon, 
we lived there rather badly.

318
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,708
Arriving in Aparri, 
we thought we were in luxury.

319
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,266
Who would have thought 
it would last so short?

320
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,793
You can take two 
of these items from the Aparri tribe.

321
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,247
2 blankets, 2 pillows, 1 hammock.

322
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:18,302
That's more or less 
all we wanted.

323
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,406
Or the tarp and the rope, 
or the fishing kit.

324
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:22,719
- What do you want? Number 1? 
- Numbers 1 and 3.

325
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:25,138
- OK. 
- We can weaken them with the tarp...

326
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,017
- No matter. 
- OK.

327
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:31,484
After we won, 
Jeff gave us instructions.

328
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:34,901
The second part of the instructions 
was a clue about the idol.

329
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,698
"Walk along the rocks.

330
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:39,565
It's easier at low tide.

331
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:42,383
Spend some time near the reef, 
and you could be protected tonight."

332
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,282
This is for us, huh? 
It is for us.

333
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:47,487
Woo and I read it, and it 
doesn't match Aparri beach,

334
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:50,305
it corresponds to Solana beach, 
where we have a wall of rocks.

335
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,913
"Choose someone...

336
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:55,532
...to fetch an idol", 
to confuse them?

337
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:56,953
On choisit Jeremiah,

338
00:16:57,002 --> 00:17:00,000
they will all believe that 
Jeremiah has a clue about the idol.

339
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,921
- OK. 
- And they'll want to fire him.

340
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:03,779
That's good.

341
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:07,986
It would be great to oust 
one of them, put the bronx on.

342
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,203
And the strongest 
Aparri is Jeremiah.

343
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,571
We'll take the comfort 
and the fishing kit.

344
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:19,636
And we have a clue 
about the immunity idol.

345
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:22,877
And we have to choose 
who to give it to.

346
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:25,918
We decided 
to give it to Jeremiah.

347
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:28,117
OK? So we're going to go there.

348
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:31,369
The comfort and the fishing kit.

349
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,609
Tony and Woo decided

350
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:40,507
to give Jeremiah 
a clue about the hidden idol.

351
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:44,490
So I think they're sending 
a signal to Jeremiah:

352
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:46,076
"we want to team up with you".

353
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:47,628
Here is the clue.

354
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:50,270
Read it alone, and then 
do what you want with it. OK?

355
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:53,111
- And we want the fishing net. 
- Yeah.

356
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:54,591
So I gave him the hint.

357
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,799
And I'm sure at that moment 
everyone was thinking:

358
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,347
"Why does Jeremiah have the clue? 
What's going on?".

359
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:03,034
They must already 
be thinking.

360
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:06,122
"Oh, oh! He's going to find the idol, 
blah blah blah."

361
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:07,875
"Walk along the rocks.

362
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,648
It's easier at low tide.

363
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,597
Spend time near the reef..."

364
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:13,417
I opened the index and read it.

365
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,706
It's actually the same clue 
we got at the Beauty tribe.

366
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:18,985
The chosen.

367
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,252
The chosen. 
For I don't know what reason.

368
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:23,967
"It's a joke".

369
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,268
Tony and Woo 
don't even know me.

370
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,523
"We have a clue about the idol,

371
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:31,376
and we choose 
to give it to Jeremiah".

372
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,823
See you next time.

373
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,512
I got six people 
watching me

374
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,813
and who will watch me closely.

375
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,525
I could be 
the next eliminated.

376
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,345
I have to take the clue again.

377
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:44,234
If he shows it to them, they'll see 
it wasn't for them.

378
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:54,134
Shame on YOU, Lindsie.

379
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,101
Hello.

380
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,072
Got a bag of rice?

381
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:04,949
The message told us 
what we could take.

382
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:07,168
- Couldn't you have rice? 
- Nope.

383
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,742
- Did you take the salt and pepper? 
- Absolutely.

384
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,796
- You will love this. 
- Do you have the frying pan?

385
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,117
You riz free!

386
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:14,667
We have traps.

387
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:17,488
Tony and Woo brought back 
lots of comfort items.

388
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,482
A mosquito net, pillows, 
blankets...

389
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:21,859
Spices, salt and pepper.

390
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:26,544
Things that LJ and I have 
n't been able to enjoy since the beginning.

391
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:28,305
That's the best part.

392
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:32,187
- That's a clue for the idol. 
- Here?

393
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,298
At first, we thought 
it was for them.

394
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,177
But that's not the case. 
It's about a rock wall.

395
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,525
This wall of rocks.

396
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:41,959
I told them 
that this message was asking us

397
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:46,198
to choose a person among them 
to give him the clue.

398
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,605
We called Jeremiah.

399
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:52,365
And we put a big, 
conspicuous target on his back.

400
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:56,979
Tony has been playing hard from the start.

401
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,909
He doesn't back down from anything. 
He lies, steals and cheats.

402
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,128
And I'm just glad 
he's on my side.

403
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:05,369
And I have something else to tell you. 
I am a police officer.

404
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,895
- I was kidding for the construction. 
- I knew it.

405
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,077
- That's smart. 
- Is it a joke?

406
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:12,040
No, it's serious.

407
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:16,506
13 days with the old Aparri, 
and I felt nothing for them.

408
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:17,984
Not the slightest feeling.

409
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:19,147
Except for Trish.

410
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:23,459
But in the new Solana, 
we bonded, it's harmonious.

411
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:26,652
Tony, I'm impressed. 
You are talented. You got me good.

412
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,766
I'm gullible, but you got me.

413
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,362
To prove 
that he is trustworthy,

414
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,546
Tony disclosed that he had lied.

415
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:37,378
It's different.

416
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:41,408
Since you also have a son, 
I was always going to swear on mine.

417
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:44,970
I didn't see him as a smart guy.

418
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:48,777
But he's quick-witted, 
he's no fool.

419
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:49,757
Truly not.

420
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:52,651
I realized, 
when he exposed all of this,

421
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:57,105
that I must be constantly 
on my guard.

422
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,857
We stay together. The five.

423
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:03,022
I love you more now 
than an hour ago.

424
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:06,016
You will wonder 
if I am lying. How to believe me?

425
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:08,080
But that, you can 
believe in it until the end.

426
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:09,114
- Yeah. 
- Until the end.

427
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,108
I have to tell you something.

428
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,803
I am a man.

429
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,822
I knew it!

430
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,207
Tony and Woo told us

431
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:28,495
that they had a clue 
about our immunity idol,

432
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:31,338
and that they could 
share it with one person.

433
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:35,908
They chose Jeremiah, 
which made everyone think.

434
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:39,585
It really rocked the camp.

435
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:44,376
So I have to 
clarify some things.

436
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:49,096
Because for me, right now, Jeremiah 
is the least trustworthy.

437
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:52,995
Jeremiah is so unpredictable.

438
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:57,389
He's so stupid 
he can't lie.

439
00:21:57,694 --> 00:22:02,100
It sounded like Alexis had 
planned out what she was going to say.

440
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:05,646
Which suggests she might 
be playing us a bit.

441
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,889
And I think she's a little smarter 
than she likes to show off.

442
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:12,799
What worries me is that 
I have seven, and I'm not one.

443
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:13,574
Yeah.

444
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,475
It's the five over there, 
Jeremiah and Sarah.

445
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:22,046
I like girls who assume 
their intelligence and their abilities.

446
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:26,038
Alexis is rather hypocritical. 
I think it plays against her.

447
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:28,800
No way to trust him for a shot.

448
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,364
Why did they give it 
to you instead of Sarah?

449
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,943
Let me ask you 
a question. We lost.

450
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:43,141
We lost. 
Why would we receive a hint?

451
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:45,243
What happened 
is that they want...

452
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:46,547
Are you saying that's not a clue?

453
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:48,170
Not a new one.

454
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,189
It's the same one we had at camp.

455
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,219
Exactly the same.

456
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:56,545
- What? It's absurd. 
- Exactly the same.

457
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:57,684
I read it.

458
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,571
The clue Tony gave me

459
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,627
is the same as we had 
in the other tribe.

460
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:04,404
He said he had to take it back.

461
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,435
So I gave it back to him.

462
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,267
Tony fooled me.

463
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:10,427
Now 
I have to get out of here.

464
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:13,683
You say they came 
with their clue?

465
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:16,020
Yes, to call me 
in front of everyone,

466
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,557
- make everyone think... 
- You're paranoid.

467
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,649
- Who? 
- You.

468
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:23,936
No, they want 
you all to vote against me.

469
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:25,545
I'm not paranoid.

470
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,705
Jeremiah's story 
is hard to swallow.

471
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,057
I think Jeremiah 
got a new clue.

472
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:32,253
He was thrilled, 
it was a new clue.

473
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,043
He looked real.

474
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,673
And it sounded like a clue 
to an idol that's here.

475
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,831
He does not deceive anyone.

476
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:54,010
Over here, everyone!

477
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:18,617
- Ready for the immunity test? 
- Yes.

478
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:22,268
First of all, Tasha, I'm getting her back.

479
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:29,892
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

480
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:34,048
Today you will build 
a staircase with wooden posts.

481
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:36,103
You will pass through 
a bamboo maze.

482
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,112
Go down a slide.

483
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:43,186
A person will move 
a key along a string.

484
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:45,412
The key will release a machete.

485
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:49,616
You will use it to release 
puzzle pieces.

486
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:56,864
Two team members will use it 
to solve a puzzle,

487
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,245
which will reveal the three numbers 
of a combination.

488
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:04,182
The first tribe to find 
the code and release their flag

489
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,975
wins immunity, 
is immune from voting.

490
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,363
Losers, you know: 
tribal council, someone will leave.

491
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:13,941
Apparri, you have two 
more people. Who will not participate?

492
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:17,029
It can't be the same 
two events in a row.

493
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:20,740
Morgan and Tash do not participate. 
Take a seat on the bench.

494
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,142
The others, one minute to 
get organized, and we'll begin.

495
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:30,723
Let's go.

496
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,499
For immunity. 
Survivors, ready?

497
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,477
Come on, Appari!

498
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:40,416
Build a staircase.

499
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:46,384
The small parts in front, 
the large ones behind.

500
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:50,282
When it's over, go up, 
and go through the maze.

501
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,334
LJ sinks into the mud.

502
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,113
It rained, the course is hard.

503
00:26:00,383 --> 00:26:04,014
Be really careful 
where you step.

504
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:06,104
Solana does anything.

505
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:08,781
They have large rooms 
in front of smaller ones.

506
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,038
Help me take it off.

507
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,754
Get this one out, get this one out!

508
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:16,779
Aparri succeeds first.

509
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:18,364
Appari climbs.

510
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:20,736
Solana is still trying 
to put it together.

511
00:26:22,478 --> 00:26:23,253
Come on, Appari!

512
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,408
Very bad start for Solana.

513
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:29,652
Now you can go.

514
00:26:35,117 --> 00:26:37,676
Go through the maze, 
follow the path.

515
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:39,896
If it's blocked, 
you can't pass.

516
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:41,363
Find the opening.

517
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,151
Come on, Appari!

518
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:44,607
Good collaboration at Solana.

519
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,061
Good collaboration at Aparri.

520
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,106
Well done, Sarah!

521
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:52,901
Sarah unties the knot for Aparri.

522
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:54,921
Woo unties the knot.

523
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,750
Woo untied the knot for Solana.

524
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:00,603
Woo is downstairs. 
Sarah has untied the knot.

525
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:01,909
You go-y!

526
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:07,956
- Go on! 
- Slip!

527
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,335
It's neck and neck. 
Three are down for Aparri.

528
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:16,749
Everyone descended 
in both tribes.

529
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:19,238
A person must now 
take care of the key.

530
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,324
It's Tony for Solana, 
Jeremiah for Aparri.

531
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,109
Come on, Jeremiah!

532
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:27,906
There you are, Tony.

533
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:31,159
That's good, Jeremiah!

534
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:35,260
Once at the end, release this key, 
and with it the machete.

535
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:37,092
You and it's presque, Jeremiah.

536
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:40,579
Jeremiah released his key. 
Untie that machete!

537
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:44,006
Tony is right behind.

538
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,799
Jeremiah released the machete.

539
00:27:48,891 --> 00:27:50,817
Tony released his key.

540
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:54,941
Jeremiah released the coins.

541
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,054
Cross all!

542
00:27:57,957 --> 00:27:59,929
Tony still takes care of the padlock.

543
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,064
Let two people put 
the puzzle pieces together!

544
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:04,250
Two only!

545
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:07,127
Tony is wasting a 
lot of his tribe's time.

546
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:09,522
Tony has the machete.

547
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:16,078
He released the coins. 
Everyone must cross.

548
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,671
Now go!

549
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:24,281
Aparri has already gathered 
all the pieces.

550
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:25,925
Looks like...

551
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:29,450
You build 
this puzzle from the bottom up.

552
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:31,951
You are looking for three numbers.

553
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:34,945
These three numbers 
will form your combination.

554
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,047
A big immunity at stake.

555
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:39,215
It's a four.

556
00:28:40,142 --> 00:28:41,622
This one, hey!

557
00:28:41,774 --> 00:28:44,721
Aparri begins to progress.

558
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:47,925
We're looking for a 41.

559
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:49,733
Turn it.

560
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,058
Like that? No that's not it.

561
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:54,136
Put it there!

562
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,083
LJ and Woo argue 
over where the rooms are.

563
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,788
LJ is sure he's right.

564
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:02,522
If his numbers don't match, 
they'll be wrong.

565
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:11,998
You might come across a piece 
that looks right but isn't.

566
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:14,604
Make sure you're right.

567
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:16,386
4 or 67.

568
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,439
Both tribes look 
for the second number.

569
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:24,570
- What's a number? 
- 67.

570
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:25,815
That's it?

571
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:27,650
Flip it!

572
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:30,679
LJ and Woo now try 
another combination.

573
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,840
They go back 
and start over.

574
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,923
LJ thinks he has understood 
something.

575
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:38,917
That's it.

576
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:41,336
No that's not it.

577
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,191
If that's so.

578
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:46,000
Aparri is still arguing 
about this second number.

579
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:50,509
LJ places another piece. 
And another.

580
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,350
Solana places another piece.

581
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,611
- They're still downstairs, calm down. 
- Solana places two more pieces.

582
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,094
Aparri begins to panic, 
they are left behind.

583
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:00,961
It takes a 67, come on!

584
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:03,266
They think it's good.

585
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,141
Big fall for LJ.

586
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:12,796
If it's right, it'll open 
the padlock, and that's immunity.

587
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,633
It's just!

588
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:21,806
Solana wins immunity!

589
00:30:23,116 --> 00:30:25,528
The top five!

590
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,923
The top five, baby!

591
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:29,528
The top five!

592
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,786
Solana, congratulations.

593
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,996
Take it, Woo.

594
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:38,428
Big immunity.

595
00:30:40,914 --> 00:30:42,757
No tribal council for Solana.

596
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:45,487
Pack your things, head back 
to camp, enjoy your free evening.

597
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:54,312
Apparri, one of you is leaving.

598
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,918
Pack your things, get back to camp, 
see you tonight at council.

599
00:30:57,494 --> 00:31:01,977
"Yeah! Top five! 
We're the bottom five!",

600
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:05,264
and I counted 
five people in front.

601
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,925
And I was not.

602
00:31:06,988 --> 00:31:10,675
I think that's telling.

603
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:13,739
I am not part 
of their plans for the future.

604
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,465
So I'm going to go ahead 
and create a new alliance.

605
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:42,181
Today, 
it's bad luck, we lost.

606
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:44,275
And that sucks, 
because we have to go to the council.

607
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:48,885
And I hate advice. 
It's the worst place in the world.

608
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:54,865
Tony made a stupid mistake 
by shouting "top five".

609
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:57,089
- Yeah. 
- That was ridiculous.

610
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,183
Yeah, that was stupid.

611
00:31:58,326 --> 00:32:01,071
Because we are seven at the moment, 
and we will be six tomorrow.

612
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:06,465
After the ordeal, 
Solana rejoiced,

613
00:32:06,572 --> 00:32:10,114
and Tony openly shouted 
"top five".

614
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:11,621
"Top Five, Baby!"

615
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:13,977
How do you say it 
in New Jersey?

616
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:16,500
- "Yeah baby!" 
- "Top five, Jeff!"

617
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,881
"Top Five, Baby!"

618
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:20,297
- "Look at my muscles, still there!" 
- "Top five!"

619
00:32:20,997 --> 00:32:23,849
Their confidence 
was very telling.

620
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:25,532
It escapes me.

621
00:32:25,854 --> 00:32:29,280
How to think of being the top five 
by being a minority?

622
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:30,249
Minority.

623
00:32:30,554 --> 00:32:34,804
They must think that one of the new 
Aparri will join them after the merger.

624
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:39,683
The only one of our tribe 
to have spoken to them is Jeremiah.

625
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,521
So I think they believe 
Jeremiah is their sixth.

626
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:47,691
Jeremiah worries me.

627
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:49,994
They were excited about their top five.

628
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:52,541
They wouldn't do this 
without having someone else.

629
00:32:52,631 --> 00:32:55,375
- Yeah. 
- And they only spoke to Jeremiah.

630
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:57,175
They shared the clue with him and...

631
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,083
Morgan and I, we know 
he'll give you his word,

632
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:03,089
but that it will 
not be sincere, that he will lie.

633
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:07,009
Alexis tried to convince us 
of the need to eliminate Jeremiah.

634
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:10,455
She wants to persuade us 
that he will change sides.

635
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:13,774
- I think we're in agreement. 
- It's the safest thing.

636
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:16,839
- So it's safe, Jeremiah? 
- Yeah.

637
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,166
And you give us your word.

638
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:22,930
I swear on everything...

639
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,189
Look, 
no fingers crossed, no nothing.

640
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,856
I will not betray.

641
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:29,113
We believe you.

642
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:32,776
Intelligence can go 
both ways at this point.

643
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:36,181
In the event of a merger, 
retaining Jeremiah is risky.

644
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,286
This is to determine 
the greatest risk.

645
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:42,290
Both have opposite ties.

646
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,072
The two could 
make deals against us.

647
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,240
We'll say yes to Alexis' plan,

648
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:50,965
we'll tell him that eliminating 
Jeremiah by surprise is fine with us.

649
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:53,874
Then we will decide 
what really suits us.

650
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:02,628
I wonder what steps 
to take towards the merger.

651
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,865
For tonight, it seems 
Intelligence is in control.

652
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:11,014
Everybody knows 
we three are strong,

653
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:12,564
and that we will vote as a whole.

654
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:15,981
We could follow Alexis 
and eliminate Jeremiah.

655
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:17,859
Or we could just 
eliminate Alexis.

656
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:19,753
The others will have to follow us.

657
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,700
Intelligence is 
in a great position.

658
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:25,195
We just have to order.

659
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,359
The brain controlling the body.

660
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,060
We found our zombies, here we go.

661
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,636
Sarah, a torch is waiting for you.

662
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:52,243
Take it and turn it on.

663
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,729
It's part of the council ritual,

664
00:34:57,812 --> 00:35:01,334
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

665
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,260
If your fire goes out, 
it's the end for you.

666
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:10,090
Kass, from the outside, 
one would assume

667
00:35:10,113 --> 00:35:12,498
that the three ex-Intelligence 
are together,

668
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,798
that the three ex-Beauties 
are together,

669
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,553
and that Sarah would be in the middle.

670
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:19,207
That's a pretty good guess.

671
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,684
Morgan, the Beauty tribe: united?

672
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:25,501
Well, Jeremiah and I 
had some difficulties.

673
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:30,825
Yes, I lied to Morgan.

674
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,666
I chose to eliminate Brice.

675
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:35,942
It drove Morgan and me apart.

676
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,843
I keep my distance, 
I give him his space.

677
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,844
Kass, seeing the issues 
between Morgan and Jeremiah,

678
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:44,782
do you feel calmer?

679
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:48,821
Yes. You would think that 
beautiful people lead the good life.

680
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,748
And then we learn that 
all is not rosy there.

681
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:54,800
It gives a little air to Intelligence.

682
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:57,478
Despite what we've been through, 
it's brought us closer.

683
00:35:57,536 --> 00:36:00,636
What they went through 
seems to have separated them.

684
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:04,701
Spencer, is this beneficial 
to the three of Intelligence?

685
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:06,463
Yes I think so.

686
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,189
But we gotta focus

687
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:11,511
on reducing divisions 
and moving forward united.

688
00:36:11,981 --> 00:36:14,059
Sarah, Spencer isn't wrong.

689
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,971
If you want to go all the way,

690
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:19,141
and you anticipate a merger, 
your group must be united.

691
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:21,818
Because you don't know what 
's going on in the other tribe.

692
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,214
You cannot rely 
on old relationships.

693
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:28,294
I think today 
I realized that I was alone.

694
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:33,431
At the test, Tony shouted, 
"Top five! Final five!".

695
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:38,277
I counted five people in front, 
and Sarah wasn't there.

696
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,602
They clearly continue without me.

697
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:45,055
So it's time 
I cut ties with them.

698
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,816
Is this a welcome addition, Alexis?

699
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:50,080
"It's over with the other tribe".

700
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:52,616
Yes, that sounds positive, in theory.

701
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:57,430
But it is always possible 
that links will be recreated.

702
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:00,436
We have to think about it. 
Especially tonight.

703
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:02,767
So who's in danger 
tonight, Tash?

704
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:03,871
In your opinion?

705
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,217
Well Jeff, 
the Beauties are in danger.

706
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:10,294
If they're as divided as 
they look.

707
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:12,384
Alexis, tell me about the raid.

708
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,592
The most interesting moment,

709
00:37:15,663 --> 00:37:18,927
that was when they took 
Jeremiah aside,

710
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,186
and we don't know what happened.

711
00:37:20,257 --> 00:37:25,000
It is unclear if this was just their way 
of giving him a clue about the idol,

712
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:28,476
or if it was to 
make him talk. No idea.

713
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:30,258
It really stirred things up.

714
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:32,829
Jeremiah, what's your version?

715
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,896
They gave me 
a clue about an idol.

716
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:37,162
And that made me a big target.

717
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,659
"They gave him a clue,

718
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:43,279
they took him aside 
to talk to him".

719
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,923
But I see clearly in their game.

720
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:47,447
And I hope they believe me.

721
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:50,947
Alexis, as Jeremiah spoke, 
you seemed to be wondering

722
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,455
if you trusted him.

723
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,146
It's a matter 
of trust, isn't it?

724
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:55,860
Completely.

725
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:57,762
Tonight, trust is central.

726
00:37:57,831 --> 00:37:59,562
I don't know if he understood 
what happened.

727
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,930
He thinks they were aiming for him.

728
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,930
But that was not their goal.

729
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:08,007
Jeff? I think that at the merger,

730
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:11,236
Jeremiah or Alexis 
could join the other side.

731
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:14,180
Tasha, you bend over, 
you feast.

732
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,493
That's very telling, Jeff.

733
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:19,781
Both Jeremiah and Alexis 
could betray.

734
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,361
And as soon as you believe 
one is the best option,

735
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:27,757
the second makes you doubt it.

736
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,760
Sarah, you're in the middle.

737
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:30,973
What do you think of all this?

738
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:35,740
Anything that takes 
the target away from me is fine with me.

739
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:37,912
I'm all for this tribe.

740
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:40,918
But there's a person here

741
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:43,776
who will join the other side.

742
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:47,099
Alexis, you nod.

743
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,461
Yes I agree.

744
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:53,448
We three are the only ones 
with opposite ties.

745
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:57,455
But only two 
have always kept their word.

746
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,292
- You mean, Sarah and you? 
- Yes.

747
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:02,950
Spencer, how 
important is this vote?

748
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:05,005
If we make 
the wrong decision,

749
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:09,397
we will occupy the 11th, 
10th, 9th, 8th and 7th places.

750
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,466
It's incredibly important.

751
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:15,752
This is probably our 
most important decision to date.

752
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,905
It's time to vote.

753
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,303
Kass, it's up to you.

754
00:39:32,197 --> 00:39:34,810
A lie is enough 
to lose my confidence.

755
00:39:34,857 --> 00:39:37,299
And you've lied a hundred times.

756
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:50,429
It is you who will betray.

757
00:39:59,337 --> 00:40:02,519
I don't doubt for a moment 
that you will betray. You must leave.

758
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:11,620
I will count the votes.

759
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:19,701
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

760
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:21,615
now is the time to do it.

761
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:28,254
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

762
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,849
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

763
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:31,870
I will read the votes.

764
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,135
First vote.

765
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:45,267
Alexis.

766
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,534
Two Alexis votes, one Jeremiah vote.

767
00:40:49,669 --> 00:40:50,667
Alexis.

768
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:53,380
Three Alexis votes, one Jeremiah vote.

769
00:40:57,197 --> 00:40:59,534
Sixth person eliminated 
from Survivor Cagayan.

770
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,518
That's four, that's enough.

771
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,561
Alexis, bring me your torch.

772
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,343
Alexis, the tribe has spoken.

773
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:24,546
It's time to go.

774
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:36,160
Two things are clear 
after this vote.

775
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:37,514
It was a big vote.

776
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:40,977
And you were united in 
your decision to eliminate Alexis.

777
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:43,631
The question that remains unanswered:

778
00:41:43,842 --> 00:41:46,637
how strong is 
this unit?

779
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,295
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

780
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:06,258
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

781
00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:11,474
In the next episode of Survivor...

782
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,504
- A rowboat? 
- Something's going on.

783
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,474
A merger causes two alliances 
to compete for power.

784
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:20,249
When these five are here, 
it will be them against us.

785
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:23,771
But one person 
holds all the cards.

786
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,460
There are five welders, 
five other welders, and me.

787
00:42:26,522 --> 00:42:29,070
I will decide the fate of the game.

788
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,567
I came wanting 
to go all the way.

789
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:36,104
I am an unconditional fan.

790
00:42:36,198 --> 00:42:39,709
I'm heartbroken that I have 
n't even reached fusion,

791
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:42,785
for not even going that far.

792
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:44,852
I really thought I was doing better.

793
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,873
I'm really disappointed.
