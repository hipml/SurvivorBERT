cat is very young and Emotional
and that's a Liability.

Situation,obviously,we would Help them.

275
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,770

286
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,420

I'm just going to be honest.

292
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,560
I just don't think your deals Are fair.

293
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,050
you wouldn't be able to cook
Anything if it weren't for us.

294
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,580
I don't even want to hear it.

295
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,770
we're not ask to borrow.

296
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,220
We're asking if we can use it.

297
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,780
I thing is,I can't make a Decision
unless I let them all Know.

298
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,630
- awlime saying-- I will let
them know that's What you want.

299
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,040
Don't come at me like I'm crazy.

300
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,680
You don't need to take
it all That serious.

301
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm just saying.

302
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,210
oh,no vote,after everything We've given
to you,that's how It's going to be?

303
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,960
So when you want fire,when you Want shelter,you use
your Womenly charms to take care of Those situations.

304
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,810
But when we ask for a boat,you Say no?

305
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,890
One world is out the window.

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,000
go back and discuss our plan With them.

307
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,930
Go back and ask about the
deal And see what they say.

308
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,330
And then come back with a
Consensus,and then we'll settle It.

309
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,840
all right.

310
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,640

311
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,490
they think it's like-- you know what they come
Across as spoiled kind of like,"where's my stuff?

312
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,510

" I don't understand,like,What
they're thinking.

315
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,260
well,maybe that's the thing.

316
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,240
We're men,they're women.

317
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,400
They think different.

318
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,820

they want to take the canoe Out and we better
discuss it or They're about to take it out.

322
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,790
that wasn't negotiated at All.

323
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,530
They
said--

324
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,440
I needed just five seconds
to Try to dry my hands out,

325
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,680

at us,like-- what happened.

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,120

I just want to sleep on one
Freaking night before I lose my Mind.

we're girls.

332
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,410
We're just not meant to
be,Like,beaten down this well.

333
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,250

now.One piece left.

533
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,940
The women win Immunity!

534
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,790
With a huge comeback!

535
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,740
I think I just aged 10 years.

536
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,400
Women,Congratulations.

537
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,660

538
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,760
No tribal council Tonight.

539
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,970
Enjoy the night off.

540
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,610
Head back to camp and celebrate.

541
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,000

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,930
Somebody will be voted out of This game.

545
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,790
You will lose your first tribe Member.

548
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,440
my mind was just blown.

549
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,110
I couldn't believe we lost.

550
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,070
But now that we've lost this Challenge,I'm
looking forward To doing this.

551
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,040
I mean I've spent eight days
out Here creating some power

552
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,040
and I Want to use it and I want
to Execute some of if tonight.

553
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,490
That's what's going to happen.

554
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,210
***

555
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,510

556
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,280

560
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:41,060
today I was worried because It was a
communication-type Challenge,but we pulled Through.

561
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,610
I know.

562
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,140
thanks,leif.

563
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,590
what's funny sthawkd tell the Boys thought they
had it in the Bag because they were so far Ahead.

564
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:01,320
And so now they're probably just All running
around like chickens With their heads cut off,

565
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,190
not Knowing what to do.

566
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,830
***

567
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,190

572
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,840
I lost my voice on that--
on That calling for sure.

573
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,150
I'm so excited to vote Someone out.

574
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,000
I dislike so many of these People.

575
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,570
Like,bill,screwed up

I'm sorry,you had a good,like,

577
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,760
Five- to seven-minute lead over
Those women,and you still lost.

578
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,100
dude,that's a knot in there,Dude.

579
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,810
Open it.

580
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,810
That's just mock,bro.

581
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:36,430
I can't deal with it.

582
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,810
"yo,bro. Bro." Shut up.

583
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,060
Go kill yourself.

584
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,950
All he's doing it dig himself a Grave.

585
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,000
you're going fishing!

586
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,210
I came right at that precise Time.

587
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,980
It's so amazing.

588
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,230
I don't want to talk to you.

589
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,190
I don't like you,stay away from Me.

590
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,300
You're ghetto trash.

591
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,440
That's all you are.

592
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,550
I can't stand him,ugggg,and
I Want him gone,yesterday.

593
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,480
Okay,this right
here,one,two,Three,four,five.

594
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,400
This is our five,solidified.

595
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,200
absolutely.

596
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,100
Plus a floater.

597
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,000
who is our floater?

598
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,220
you know,bill.

599
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,150
is going first.

600
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,050
- oh,really?
- yeah.

601
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,780
what happened?

602
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,270
he's too wishy-washy.

603
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,880
okay,but why don't we make Him second.

604
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,530
Matt say real danger.

605
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,890
bill is the type that will Slip
up behind you and slit your Throat.

606
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,730
and we all know that,don't We?

607
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,180
you need to eliminate that,First.

608
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,020
right now there are clearly
Two sides in our tribe.

609
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,060
There's matt,mike,jay,and Bill.

610
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,660
And then there's me and
jonas,Tarzan,leif,and colton.

611
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,920
We've got the numbers,so
the Guys in the alliance

612
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,120
basically Are the ones who
are picking who Is going home.

613
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,000
If it's going to be
matt,it's Going to be matt.

614
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,110
If they switch it and say it's Going
to be bill,it's going to Be bill.

615
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,060
And really the one making the
Biggest suggestion is colton.

616
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,800
everybody's out chatting.

617
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,300
I figured I'd come see what
Everybody is chatting about.

618
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,320
And it got quiet when I walked
Up so I can only assume--

619
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,000
well,we're not voting
you Out,so don't worry.

620
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,830
is it you guys right here?

621
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,010
it might be.

622
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,520
Do you want to be with us?

623
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,690
We all like you?

624
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,390
I think you just backthe Wrong horse.

625
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,820
that's why wriewr not-- That's why
wriewr you're not on The ticket right now.

626
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,280
Can you make a decision
while You're standing there.

627
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,730
jay bird.

628
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,870
if they have the numbers and I'm not a
part of that,that Puts a target on my back,

629
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,880
so I Can either join them
or butt Heads with them,

630
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,790
so I basically Had no options and
said,"okay,I'll vote with you guys.

631
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,320
" it seems like the consensus
Is bill at the moment.

632
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,620
that the name.

633
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,280
I'm cool with that?

634
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,980
- Are you cool with that?
- yeah.

635
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:55,220
the best guy would have been Matt,but we're a
team,if you Guys want to do bill,we'll do Bill.

636
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,780
here comes matt.

637
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,050
what's all the deep thought About?

638
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,620
we're-- we're-- to be
honest,We're talking strategies.

639
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,990
okay.

640
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,550
I mean,obviously,right?

641
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,540
- seems pretty obvious.
- yeah.

642
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,690
is my presence destroying
the Strategy talk?

643
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,770
no. yes,it is,at the moment.

644
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,510
Well it is.

645
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,130
I walked up intentionally on
These guys having a Conversation.

646
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,000
Clearly right in front
of me About strategy,

647
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,460
so I just wanted To stick my
head in it and shake It up.

648
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
I don't like people talking
like That when I'm not involved.

649
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,190
I walked up there and it got Quiet.

650
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,290
I'll leave you boys be.

651
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,770
I walked away,no problem.

652
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,630
What I did want to
do is pull Troy aside.

653
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,140
you want to talk alone?

654
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,440
yeah.

655
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,380
troy and I spent the last Week as the heads
of two snakes That are battling each other.

656
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,020
You're either with me and
my Guys or you're with troy.

657
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,350
And I've decided that
something Had to be said.

658
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,130
well,there was-- this Concept of
let's get rid of all The muscle.

659
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,320
It's voant,just like it's Convenient
for all the muscle to Band together.

660
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:12,990
of course.

661
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,240
but it's easy.

662
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,300
I think we've got to come up
With a smaller group of guys.

663
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,740
right.that we intend on diving
deep Into this game with.

664
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,760
Me,you,jay,maybe
mike,maybe One other guy.

665
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,220
All of us are roosters and we Don't
want any other roosters With me.

666
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,490
The chickens,they can't
break Up the roosters.

667
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,000
And that's how I saw it from day One
and,frankly,I saw you as Part of the roosters.

668
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:39,270
I would love to create a new Reality and let
all the idiots Scramble and get rid of colton.

669
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,000
the guys in power are going To vote
for colton and when we Get back to camp

670
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,050
they're going To realize the average
joes are Not calling the shots

671
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,290
and things Have changed around here
and I'm Still in the front of of it.

672

We're in an alliance and we'll Like

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,970
It ain't "survivor" unless You're lying.

679
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,020
Matt is so dangerous to me,Dude.

680
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,350
It's like,when he talks he's
Like,"this is what we've got to Do.

681

included me with the rooster Group.

00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,570
I think matt is
so power Hungry--

684
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,480

well,everybody wants to vote For bill.

686

right now,the vote is
Between bill and matt.

687
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,050
If I had my way bill would
go Because he's annoying

688
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,100
and I hate Him and I hate his voice
and I Can't stand to listen to him Talk.

689
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,640
Matt,on the other hand,is
like The hltd of the snake

690
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,460
and you Have to chop off the headst
Snake for the rest of it to Stop-

are you ready to go,boss?

Either one makes me perfectly Happy.

695
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,230
Honestly,out of this tribe
of Nine,if I could get rid of,

696
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,930
Like,five people,it would be Heaven.

697
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,150
Behind each of you is A torch.

698
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,410
Go ahead and grab a torch
and Approach the flame.

699
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,570
Dip it in and get fire.

700
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,410
This is part of the ritual at
Tribal council because in this Game,

701
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,430
fire represents your life.

702
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,080
When your fire is gone,so are You.

703
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,600
So,michael,with nine guys,There has
to be a little bit of A power struggle,

704
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,910
at least Initially.

705
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,840
you know,the dynamics
just Kind of came together.

706
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,620
Like,me and matt clicked Instantly.

707
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,270
He's somebody you can work with.

708
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,040
But there are a lot of different
Alliances gog in this tribe.

709
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,300
It's hard to keep track of.

710
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,460
Tarzan,so only eight Games within this game
there are Fractions within this group of Nine.

711
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:07,060
as far as I'm concerned,we Have an
alliance of five and I Trust those five.

712
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,560
And I think we'll stick Together.

713
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,110
That's what I believe.

714
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,440
So,colton,if There's an alliance of five That's
strong,math says the Other four would be in trouble.

715
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,780
well,I'm not uncomfortable
Because I'm not going home Tonight.

716
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,710
And why is that?

717
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,170
because I have an idol.

718
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,650
The girls gave it to me.

719
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,310
So you're saying You're not going
home because You're going to play it--

720
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:27,930
yeah.

721
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,130
I'm not going to be a james.

722
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,420
I'm not going to have
an idol And go home.

723
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,020
That's stupid.

724
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,610
Michael,is there a Thought that
an idol at camp is Too disruptive

725
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,430
so let's throw Some votes just
to make sure we Get it out.

726
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,200
that's on a lot of our minds.

727
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,990
Colton,he's colton.

728
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,870
This whole time he's
worked with Two tribes.

729
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,750
He was sleeping over there,Eating
over there and we didn't Know

730
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,530
which way it was going and
Then he has an idol on our side

731
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,740
So it's disrupting the whole Game.

732
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,950
Colton,you've been Spending
a lot of time with the Women.

733
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,680
well,yeah,that shouldn't be A shock.

734
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,280
Wait,a second,why
Shouldn't that be a shock?

735
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,820
Are you on the men's tribe.

736
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,970
all of my friends at home are Girls.

737
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,160
You're not on their Tribe.

738
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,480
You don't compete with them.

739
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,340
You don't go to tribal council,And
so you look at me and say,

740
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,680
"duuh.Tts a severse
duuh,double dare On you.

741
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:21,590
here's the thing,women are
More,like,nurturing and they Pet and you

742
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,600
they tell you,you
Know,it's going to be okay.

743
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,030
Do you realize what Kind of a target
you put on your Back when you say that?

744
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,080
well,yeah,but that Distribute mean
I'm going to Vote with those women.

745
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,310
Bill,explain to me How this makes sense.

746
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,660
I mean,honestly,as much as He
assumed that we spot on Judged him.

747
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,820
He spot on judged us and assumed
We wouldn't take him in --

748
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,130
you mean,because he's gay?

749
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,780
yeah.

750
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,130
Tarzan.

751
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,450
here's what we discovered.

752
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,040
Colton's highly intelligent.

753
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,900
He's invaluable with regard to
Understanding how this game Plays.

754
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:02,590
He already has allegiances with Females over
there,and when we Combine,he's already said.

755
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,690
He's real smart.

756
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,410
If we value our sevival we need
Him in the first few plays here.

757
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,680
who is "we," tarzan.

758
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,830
I'm talk ago I used the
word "we" in a general sense.

759
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,030
I'm trying to help
colton defend His status

760
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,730
because I believe He's very valuable

761
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,260
and I think Our team will prosper
if he Stays here a bit longer.

762
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,070
And,matt,you're not Buying it.

763
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,750
well,I think tarzan has,you
Know,put out a cry for help to

764
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,020
Whoever it is the five
guys who Are with him.

765
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,870
And it does seem like tarzan is
Shivering in his boots over Here,

766
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,670
and I'm just getting sick Of him using
vague terms and Want him to talk turkey.

767
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,990
you're absolutely wrong.

768
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,980
That's not the motive
behind What I'm saying.

769
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,360
I'm not buying it.

770
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,780
my heart is broken that
he Misinterprets me.

771
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,830
Matt,are you Enjoying this game?

772
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,990
Because you seem a little Agitated.

773
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,190
well,yeah,some of the Things that have been
said here Tonight agitate me,mainly Tarzan.

774
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,330
Tarzan is always talking.

775
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:01,510
Everybody is always lawftion at Tarzan but
you don't know who is Taking him seriously.

776
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,090
I want people to listen
and take Me seriously.

777
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,740
Do you think people Take you seriously?

778
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,220
I do.

779
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,430
How will tonight's Vote
change this game for you?

780
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,820
we all get one chance to make Hay move that
sets the ball in Motion,and that's tonight.

781
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,510
I think the game does
change all The time.

782
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,220
You always have to be willing to Reassess
and always be changing What you're doing.

783
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,620
Bill,how concerned Are you that tonight's
vote will Not go the way you want it to Go?

we have a betrayal.

834
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,160
oh,my-- the monano tribe
has lost Their marbles.

835
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,130
you will be first to go in Such
an egregious breech of Faith.

836
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,670
that's a hasty decision.

837
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,760
I'm thinking what?

838
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,870
you got that.

839
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,570
no.I want him gone.

840
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,090
I told you to pick a side
and You picked the wrong side.

841
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,900
I want his head on a platter.

842
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,660
one out,you know,eight days Is
an incredible disappointment.

843
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,800
You know I came out here with Big
expectations and a plan to Do it

844
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,380
and it didn't work out for Me.

845
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,170
But I thought in the last couple Of
days I had reworked something With troy

846
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,860
to get the numbers Back in my
favor,and clearly,I Was wrong.

847
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,760
I was probably as a fashion blogger,I
love when I get to do a morning talk show.
