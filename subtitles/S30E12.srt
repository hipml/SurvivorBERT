1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,127
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,713
"SURVIVOR"...

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:05,255
>> A GREAT JOB THAT YOU ALL

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:05,588
FLIPPED ON.

5
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,591
>> WHO DID I FLIP ON, YOU WHACK

6
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:08,883
JOB?

7
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,051
>> Jeff: THE GAME SEEMED

8
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,679
SIMPLE: IT WAS EVERYONE VERSUS

9
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:12,887
MIKE.

10
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,889
>> THE ONLY REASON MIKE IS STILL

11
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,141
HERE IS HE WON IMMUNITY.

12
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,268
THE NEXT IMMUNITY HE LOSES,

13
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,019
SMELL YOU LATER.

14
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,062
>> Jeff: BELOW THE SURFACE

15
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,564
THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE.

16
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,314
DAN WON AN ADVANTAGE IN THE

17
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:23,523
GAME.

18
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,984
>> YOU BOUGHT YOURSELF AN EXTRA

19
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:26,192
VOTE.

20
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,111
>> HE'S GOT THE IDOL.

21
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,197
>> Jeff: AND BETH CAROLYN AND

22
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,367
MIKE HAVE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS.

23
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,077
>> I'M SAFE WITH MY HIDDEN

24
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,787
IMMUNITY IDOL.

25
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,330
>> Jeff: MEANWHILE, BIRTHDAY

26
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,874
BOY RODNEY STARTED TO

27
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:41,207
SELF-DESTRUCT.

28
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,668
>> I'M REALLY PISSED ON MAMA C.

29
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,881
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF SCUMBAGS THAT

30
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,883
NEGLECTED ME ON MY BIRTHDAY.

31
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:50,508
THEY ABOUT IT GOING TO THE END.

32
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,011
>> Jeff: CAROLINE CONSIDERED

33
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:53,470
TEAMING UP WITH MIKE.

34
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,889
>> HE HAS A LOT OF POWER.

35
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,473
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO THINK ABOUT

36
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,807
TEAMING UP WITH HIM.

37
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,644
>> Jeff: CAROLYN WON THE

38
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,270
SECOND IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IN A

39
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:02,437
ROW.

40
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,146
>> I'M SO EXCITED.

41
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,273
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL --

42
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,318
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

43
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,861
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

44
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,739
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

45
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,073
MIKE PLAYED HIS IDOL, FORCING

46
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,785
THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE OF SIX TO

47
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,286
FINALLY TURN ON EACH OTHER.

48
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,746
12th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

49
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,372
FIFTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, TYLER.

50
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,166
IN THE END THEY VOTED OUT TYLER.

51
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,459
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

52
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,377
NOW MIKE IS LEFT WITHOUT ANY

53
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:26,669
PROTECTION.

54
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,670
SIX ARE LEFT.

55
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:44,729
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

56
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,314
>> CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

57
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:50,026
>> WE ARE NOW WITH THE ORIGINAL

58
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,486
NUMBERS THAT WE ALL STARTED

59
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,070
WITH.

60
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,154
>> TRIBAL TONIGHT WAS A WHOLE

61
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,782
LOT OF FUN FOR ME BECAUSE I

62
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,407
FINALLY GOT THE BRECK APART THE

63
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,910
SIX.

64
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,245
FOUR VOTES, HEY.

65
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,913
THEY, GUYS.

66
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,289
BECAUSE I PLAYED MY IDOL

67
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,916
TONIGHT, I COULD BE VULNERABLE,

68
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,126
SO TO SECURE MY SPOT, I EITHER

69
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,211
NEED THE FIND ANOTHER IDOL, OR I

70
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,131
NEED TO WIN IMMUNITY THE REST OF

71
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:17,053
THE TIME OUT.

72
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:17,387
COME ON, BABY.

73
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,390
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

74
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,475
>> YOU WANT ME TO GET IN THERE?

75
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:22,892
LY.

76
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,229
>> EVERYBODY WANTS MIKE GONE.

77
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,690
BECAUSE MIKE HAS ALREADY PROVEN

78
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,191
THAT HE'S SELFISH AND THAT HE'S

79
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,776
SELF-CENTERED.

80
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,862
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING, TO HIS

81
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,070
CREDIT.

82
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,364
HE DROPPED AN ATOMIC BOMB AND HE

83
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,408
WHIPPED OUT THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

84
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,245
IDOL, BUT ALL MIKE GETS IS ONE

85
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,830
FREE PASS, AND THAT'S ALL HE'S

86
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,831
GETTING.

87
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,833
>> YOU WANT ME TO GET DOWN

88
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,041
THERE?

89
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,418
>> I HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN

90
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,212
WORKING WITH MIKE AT THIS POINT.

91
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,589
>> HA.

92
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,381
I WIN.

93
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,841
MIKE, HE HAS TO BE THE HERO.

94
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,259
IT'S THE FACT THAT HE'S SO

95
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,011
ARROGANT AND HE'S SO CON

96
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:58,303
DESCENDING.

97
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,429
TO HELL WITH MIKE.

98
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,432
TO HELL WITH HIS IDOL.

99
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,143
SOMEBODY ELSE LIKES A SHOT,

100
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:05,351
MIKE.

101
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,395
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M IN

102
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,814
THE POSITION OF POWER, BECAUSE I

103
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,440
HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME,

104
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,400
WHICH IS AN EXTRA VOTE AT THE

105
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,277
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

106
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,361
BESIDES, I TEAMED UP WITH

107
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,363
CAROLYN, SIERRA, WILL AND

108
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,324
RODNEY, AND I GENUINELY HOPE THE

109
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,117
FIVE OF US CAN TAKE MIKE OUT OF

110
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,452
THIS GAME.

111
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,747
>> YOU'RE ALL IN, RIGHT?

112
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,291
>> I HOPE SO.

113
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,376
I DON'T TRUST DAN BECAUSE DAN IS

114
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,544
THE BIGGEST THREAT OTHER THAN

115
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,129
MIKE IN THIS GAME BECAUSE DAN'S

116
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,047
ADVANTAGE IS A VERY HUGE THREAT

117
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,882
IN THE GAME.

118
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,507
>> ALL RIGHT.

119
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,383
I'M IN.

120
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,343
MY WORD IS MY BOND.

121
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,762
>> I HAVE MY IDOL, SO THAT SAVES

122
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,263
ME FOR ONE, BUT THAT DOESN'T GET

123
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,348
ME TO THE FINAL FOUR OR THE

124
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:43,640
FINAL THREE.

125
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:48,645
SO I NEED MIKE TO SOLIDIFY, GOD

126
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,646
FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH,

127
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,814
YOU KNOW, THAT SIDE.

128
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:57,320
I WANT OPTIONS.

129
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,363
THE NEXT VOTE IS GOING TO BE THE

130
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:58,696
PIVOTAL VOTE.

131
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,989
>> YEAH.

132
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:00,823
>> DAN HAS TO GO.

133
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,449
>> WE GOT TO GET DAN OUT.

134
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,370
>> HE'S DONE, IN MY OPINION.

135
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:05,703
HE GOES NEXT.

136
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,372
>> BUT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

137
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,165
NUMBERS TO GET DAN OUT, AND HE

138
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,209
HAS HIS ADVANTAGE.

139
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:18,216
HIS ADVANTAGE IS AN EXTRA VOTE.

140
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,717
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

141
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,301
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

142
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:20,969
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

143
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,179
>> HE'S GOT AN EXTRA VOTE AT

144
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:23,596
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

145
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,765
>> IT GIVES HIM AN EXTRA VOTE,

146
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,393
SO HE CAN JUST PULL A VOTE?

147
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,520
>> HE GETS TWO VOTES.

148
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,313
>> I LOVE MY NEW LITTLE ANGEL

149
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,315
CAROLYN, BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT

150
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,233
DAN'S ADVANTAGE IS NOW.

151
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,901
I HOPE THAT SHE FEELS LIKE SHE

152
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,528
CAN TRUST ME AND THAT WE CAN

153
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,445
MOVE FORWARD AND WORK TOGETHER A

154
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,281
LITTLE BIT TO ELIMINATE SOME

155
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:42,865
BIGGER THREATS IN THIS GAME.

156
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,284
>> THAT'S HUGE, ESPECIALLY WHEN

157
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,036
NUMBERS ARE THIS LOW.

158
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,954
THAT'S A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.

159
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:56,129
>> THAT'S WHY IT IS SO DEADLY.

160
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,255
I AM SMACK IN THE MIDDLE.

161
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,423
I GOT STUFF WORKING HERE AND I

162
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,799
GOT STUFF WORKING OVER.

163
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,175
THERE I'M GOING TO TELL HIM WHAT

164
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,468
HE WANTS THE HEAR, BUT IF MIKE

165
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,139
DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY, GOT TO GO.

166
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,849
>> MAN, OH, MAN, OH, MAN.

167
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,933
>> CRITICAL VOTE.

168
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,184
IT COULD BE THE TURNING POINT OF

169
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,270
THE GAME.

170
00:05:51,476 --> 00:06:03,988
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

171
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,865
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

172
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,282
REWARD CHALLENGE?

173
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,325
>> YES, WE ARE.

174
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,827
>> FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, WE'LL

175
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,287
DIVIDE INTO TWO TEAMS OF THREE.

176
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,081
>> ON MY GO, YOU WILL RACE

177
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,000
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES,

178
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:16,584
UNTYING KNOTS TO RELEASE A

179
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,086
DOORWAY.

180
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:18,628
YOU'LL THEN USE A HATCHET TO

181
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,091
CHOP A ROPE, WHERE YOU'LL SEE

182
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:23,841
PUZZLE PIECES.

183
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,467
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE PUZZLE

184
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,220
PIECE, YOU'LL USE THEM TO SOLVE

185
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,304
A WORD PUZZLE.

186
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,056
FIRST THREE TO GET IT RIGHT WIN

187
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:30,306
REWARD.

188
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,475
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING

189
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:32,642
FOR?

190
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,309
>> YES.

191
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,227
>> DEFINITELY.

192
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,394
>> Jeff: TODAY THE WINNING

193
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,854
TEAM WILL BE PICKED UP BY A

194
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,397
CHOPPER, TAKEN ON A HELICOPTER

195
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,941
TOUR OF THIS COUNTRY THAT YOU'VE

196
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,484
BEEN LIVING IN FOR THE PAST 33

197
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,819
DAYS.

198
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,363
YOU'LL THEN TOUCH DOWN AND ENJOY

199
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,573
A NICE SURF AND TURF WITH WINE,

200
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,284
BE TAKEN BACK TO CAMP THE RESUME

201
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,327
THE GAME.

202
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,162
33 DAYS IN, RODNEY, YOU'RE STILL

203
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,748
THE ONLY GUY WHO IS YET TO WIN A

204
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,374
REWARD.

205
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:56,999
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THAT?

206
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,336
>> I'M SEEING STARS, JEFF.

207
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,754
I WAKE UP NAUSEOUS.

208
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,505
I'VE BEEN ON THE SAME BEACH FOR

209
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,840
33 DAYS.

210
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,590
I FEEL LUKE I'VE BEEN IN JAIL

211
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,676
AND I HAVEN'T ABLE TO EXPERIENCE

212
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,553
NOTHING WITH NOBODY OUT HERE,

213
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,721
BUT MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL FEEL FOR

214
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,015
ME, 0 FOR 5.

215
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,060
>> Jeff: WAIT, SOMEBODY WILL

216
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:20,565
WHAT, GIVE YOU THEIR REWARD?

217
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,607
>> MAYBE.

218
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,860
>> Jeff: SO IS IT ENTITLEMENT

219
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,777
THAT YOU'RE FEELING THAT PEOPLE

220
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,945
SHOULD GIVE YOU A REWARD?

221
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,864
>> THE ONLY ONE I CARED ABOUT

222
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,365
WAS MY BIRTHDAY, AND WHEN A

223
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,033
FRIEND SAID THEY WERE GOING TO

224
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,160
DO SOMETHING FOR ME AND THEY

225
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:32,702
DIDN'T, IT KIND OF HURT ME A

226
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,578
LITTLE BIT.

227
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,620
>> Jeff: MIKE, ANOTHER BIG

228
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,123
ELEMENT OF THIS THAT SEEMS TO BE

229
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,249
MISSING IS THE REASON IT'S

230
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,959
CALLED A REWARD IS YOU EARNED IT

231
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,377
AND IT GIVES YOU AN ADVANTAGE.

232
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,796
THAT IS THE DESIGN OF THE GAME.

233
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,631
>> IT'S TOUGH TO SEE HIM

234
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,465
STRUGGLING.

235
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,049
HE'S OBVIOUSLY STRUGGLING, BUT

236
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,218
THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS WIN.

237
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,972
IF YOU WIN, YOU GO ON IT

238
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,683
GUARANTEED.

239
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,393
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

240
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:57,727
LET'S GET TO IT.

241
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,730
WE'LL DRAW FOR TEAMS.

242
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,731
LET'S GET STARTED.

243
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,440
ALL RIGHT.

244
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,482
WE HAVE OUR TEAMS.

245
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,777
IT IS DAN, SIERRA AND RODNEY

246
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,738
TAKING ON CAROLYN, MIKE AND

247
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,989
WILL.

248
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,449
HERE WE GO.

249
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:17,079
FOR REWARD, SURVIVORS READY?

250
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,332
GO.

251
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,792
EVERYBODY MAKES IT DOWN QUICKLY

252
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,085
THROUGH THE FIRST OBSTACLE.

253
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,172
GOT TO MOVE TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

254
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:26,714
DEAD EVEN RIGHT OUT OF THE

255
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,090
START.

256
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,300
DAN STRUGGLING A LITTLE WITH

257
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:29,508
THIS.

258
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,843
>> COME ON, COME ON.

259
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,762
COME ON.

260
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,472
>> Jeff: ONCE EVERYBODY'S

261
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,183
THERE YOU CAN MOVE ON.

262
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:37,975
GO, BLUE!

263
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,768
GO, RED!

264
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,062
NOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THE KNOTS.

265
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,730
YOU GOT TO UNTIE EVERY SINGLE

266
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:42,939
KNOT.

267
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,524
IT IS DAN, SIERRA AND RODNEY.

268
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,819
>> GOT IT, GOT IT.

269
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,529
>> Jeff: WORKING QUICKLY

270
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,197
THROUGH THE KNOTS.

271
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,157
ONCE YOU HAVE THEM, THAT

272
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:53,908
DRAWBRIDGE WILL DROP.

273
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,159
BLUE NOW IN THE LEAD.

274
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,869
RED STILL WORKING ON THEIR

275
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,411
KNOTS.

276
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,788
THERE YOU GO.

277
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,541
MOVE THROUGH.

278
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,668
IT IS DAN AND MIKE WORKING WITH

279
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:09,006
THE HATCHET.

280
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,468
DAN ATTACKS IT IN TWO CHOPS.

281
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,970
MIKE IN TWO CHOPS.

282
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,722
PUZZLE PIECES, START COLLECTING.

283
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,058
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LETTERS.

284
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,601
IF IT IS BLANK, YOU DON'T NEED

285
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:20,935
IT.

286
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,895
THIS IS WHERE COMMUNICATION IS

287
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,437
KEY.

288
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,564
EVERYBODY GOT TO WORK TOGETHER.

289
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,149
RODNEY, YOU'RE STILL COLLECTING.

290
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,734
RODNEY, YOU'RE STILL COLLECTING.

291
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,735
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE ON THE

292
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,736
SAME PAGE.

293
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,072
>> THROW THE BLANK ONES THAT

294
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,073
WAY, THE OTHER WAY.

295
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,283
>> GO, GO, GO.

296
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,909
>> BLUE THINKS THEY HAVE THEM

297
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,910
ALL, THEY'RE GOING TO START

298
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,577
WORKING ON THE PUZZLE.

299
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,496
>> JUST LAY THEM OUT.

300
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,622
>> GO, GO, GO.

301
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,707
>> Jeff: RED NOW THINKS THEY

302
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,625
HAVE ALL THEIR PIECES.

303
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,086
>> LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

304
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,629
>> Jeff: SIX-WORD PHRASE

305
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:53,634
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

306
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:58,139
WHAT COULD IT BE?

307
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,933
USE YOUR "SURVIVOR" KNOWLEDGE.

308
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,687
THINK ABOUT HOW WE TALK ON

309
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:04,979
"SURVIVOR."

310
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,105
RED LOOKING NEXT DOOR TRYING TO

311
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:06,480
GET A CAN CLUE.

312
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,233
>> IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING

313
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,068
ABOUT REWARD.

314
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,695
>> Jeff: A LOT OF STRATEGY IN

315
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,448
THIS CHALLENGE TO TRY TO PREVENT

316
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:15,698
CHEATING.

317
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,991
>> GOOD CALL ACTUALLY.

318
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,660
>> Jeff: NOW TRIBES ARE

319
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,411
TURNING LETTERS OVER.

320
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,495
I DON'T KNOW THE PROGRESS THAT

321
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,625
EITHER TEAM IS MAKING.

322
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,672
>> WHAT IS NEXT?

323
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,758
>> Jeff: 33 DAYS IN.

324
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,218
IT IS AS IF THIS IS A FOREIGN

325
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,304
LANGUAGE BEING LEARNED FOR THE

326
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:38,721
FIRST TIME.

327
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,891
BOTH TEAMS ABSOLUTELY STUMPED.

328
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,477
START THINKING "SURVIVOR."

329
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,604
IT'S BEEN ON FOR 30 SEASONS.

330
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,230
I SAY THE SAME 200 WORDS OTHER

331
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,899
AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND

332
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,317
OVER.

333
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,319
I'M IN THERAPY I SAY THE WORDS

334
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,320
SO OFTEN.

335
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:58,240
>> CAN WE BUY A VOWEL, JEFF?

336
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,785
>> Jeff: YOU'VE BEEN OUT HERE

337
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:05,873
A LONG TIME.

338
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,876
>> IT'S A W.

339
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,044
>> Jeff: MAYBE THIS IS A BIT

340
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,337
OF A BLUE COLLAR PHRASE.

341
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,546
THIS IS NOT HARVARD.

342
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,714
STOP BEING WORRIED ABOUT BEING

343
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:22,848
GRADED FOR YOUR GRAMMAR.

344
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:27,144
WE ARE ONE HOUR INTO SOLVING

345
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,354
THIS PUZZLE.

346
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,439
>> IT'S KILLING ME.

347
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:30,898
>> Jeff: THIS IS NOW

348
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,401
OFFICIALLY THE LONGEST WORD

349
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,777
PUZZLE IN OUR HISTORY.

350
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,738
WHAT IS IT YOU ARE PLAYING FOR?

351
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:42,034
WHAT DOES IT COME WITH?

352
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,495
>> I'M NOT EVEN LISTENING TO

353
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:44,662
HIM.

354
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,996
>> HE'S GIVING US HINTS.

355
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,997
>> I KNOW.

356
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,833
>> Jeff: IT'S ONE OF THOSE

357
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,209
COMMERCIAL, AND IF YOU ORDER NOW

358
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:55,506
YOU GET THIS WITH THIS AND THIS.

359
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:55,965
COMPLETE SET.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

361
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:02,930
>> YES!

362
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,807
OH, MY GOD.

363
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,977
OH, MY GOD.

364
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,520
I SEE ENERGY FOR THE FIRST TIME

365
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,147
IN THIS CHALLENGE, SMILES.

366
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,648
DAN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

367
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,065
THEY DON'T HAVE IT.

368
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:13,899
>> WE GOT IT.

369
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,568
WE GOT IT.

370
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,777
WE GOT IT!

371
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,571

372
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:18,737
IT.

373
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,659
A REWARD WITH ALL THE FIXINGS!

374
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,203
MIKE, CAROLYN, WILL WIN REWARD.

375
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,496
>> COME TALK TO ME.

376
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,751
>> BOO-AYE!

377
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,711
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

378
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,253
CAROLYN, MIKE, WILL, NICE

379
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,379
REWARD.

380
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,672
THIS COULD BE JUST WHAT YOU NEED

381
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:42,511
TO GET TO THE END.

382
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,971
CAROLYN, YOU'RE STARING AT THE

383
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,139
BLUE TEAM.

384
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,891
YOU GOOD TO GO?

385
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:51,562
>> NOT YET.

386
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,980
THIS IS SO FRICKEN HARD FOR ME

387
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:53,814
RIGHT NOW.

388
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,025
>> Jeff: CONSIDERING WHETHER

389
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,152
OR NOT TO GIVE UP YOUR REWARD TO

390
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:58,360
RODNEY.

391
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,487
I TALK TO THIS GUY.

392
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,738
I TOLD HIM I WOULD GIVE IT TO

393
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:00,905
HIM.

394
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,825
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M WANTING TO

395
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,660
DO YET.

396
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,995
>> Jeff: SO YOUR DEBATE IS

397
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:08,329
LAYERED.

398
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,415
ON THE ONE HAND, THIS IS A

399
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,541
SOCIAL GAME.

400
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,127
YOU GIVE YOUR REWARD TO RODNEY.

401
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,337
YOU GET TO THE END, YOU MIGHT

402
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,670
GET ONE VOTE.

403
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,964
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU LET

404
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,800
RODNEY ON THIS, FILL UP HIS

405
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,178
BELLY, SPIRITUALLY GET

406
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:24,970
REAWAKENED, AND IT COULD BE WHAT

407
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,430
HE NEEDS TO GO TO THE END AND

408
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,306
GET RID OF YOU.

409
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:34,313
IT'S A BIG, BIG DECISION.

410
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:34,980
>> ALL RIGHT.

411
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:40,444
I'M GOING TO KEEP IT.

412
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,362
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

413
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,446
CAROLYN'S GOING TO KEEP HER

414
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,030
REWARD.

415
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,823
CAROLYN, MIKE, WILL, GRAB YOUR

416
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,032
STUFF.

417
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,284
HEAD OUT, ENJOY YOUR REWARD.

418
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:47,660
CONGRATULATIONS.

419
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,912
>> I DO FEEL BAD FOR RODNEY THAT

420
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,497
HE HASN'T WON A REWARD AND I'VE

421
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,122
BEEN ON EVERY REWARD EXCEPT FOR

422
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,207
ONE.

423
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,875
I HOPE HE DOESN'T TAKE IT

424
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,293
PERSONALLY, BUT THIS IS MY

425
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,920
"SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE, AS WELL.

426
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,005
>> Jeff: SIERRA, DAN, RODNEY,

427
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:00,881
GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

428
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,677
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

429
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,761
CAMP.

430
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,280
>> IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET TO

431
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,407
FLY IN A HELICOPTER, MAMA C.

432
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:26,949
>> NO, NOT EVERY DAY.

433
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,367
>> I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A

434
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,618
HELICOPTER BEFORE IN MY ENTIRE

435
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:36,500
LIFE, AND IT WAS EPIC.

436
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:36,917
IT'S BREATHTAKING.

437
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,211
I CAN SEE A CENTRAL KAY KNOW

438
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:39,461
COMING UP.

439
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,379
>> OH, MY GOD.

440
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,881
>> YOU EVER BEEN THIS CLOSE TO A

441
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,257
VOLCANO, WILL?

442
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,507
>> NEVER.

443
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,552
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.

444
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,804
I'M GOING BY A VOLCANO THAT'S

445
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:49,263
STEAMING RIGHT NOW.

446
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,932
>> YOU GOT A NO COLLAR YOU GOT A

447
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,350
WHITE COLLAR AND YOU GOT A BLUE

448
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:53,601
COLLAR.

449
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,602
>> WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

450
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,520
>> I'VE BEEN BLESSED TO BE ON A

451
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,938
LOT OF DIFFERENT REWARDS, BUT

452
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,064
THE HELICOPTER RIDE IS THE

453
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,399
GREATEST REWARD EVER.

454
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,568
THERE'S NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW

455
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,404
FABULOUS IT REALLY IS.

456
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,532
OH, MY GOD.

457
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,160
>> WE'RE GOING TO FILL OUR

458
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:11,744
BELLIES TODAY.

459
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,286
ALL RIGHT.

460
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,371
THE BEST REWARD EVER.

461
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,080
>> WE LAND IN THIS OPEN FIELD,

462
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,166
AND THERE'S THIS TABLE AND IT'S

463
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,710
GOT ALL THE FOOD ON IT THAT YOU

464
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,086
COULD EVER WANT OR NEED TO GET

465
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,087
YOURSELF THROUGH THE REST OF

466
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,215
THIS GAME.

467
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,967
IS IT JUST ME OR CAN YOU ALL

468
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,303
ACTUALLY FEEL YOUR MIND GETTING

469
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:29,511
SHARPER?

470
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,137
>> MY WHOLE BODY JUST WOKE UP.

471
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,474
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS

472
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,308
FINAL THREE?

473
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,810
>> I THINK FINAL THREE WITH THE

474
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,978
THREE OF US IS A STRONG FINAL

475
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,021
THREE.

476
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,273
AND WE GET EVERY COLLAR, RIGHT

477
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,067
IN NO COLLAR, WHITE COLLAR, BLUE

478
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,525
COLLAR.

479
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,778
MIKE BROUGHT UP THE PITCH THAT

480
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,362
MIKE, ME AND WILL COULD GO TO

481
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,030
THE FINAL THREE, WHICH WAS KIND

482
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,074
OF INTERESTING BECAUSE I COULD

483
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,200
REALLY WORK WITH HIM.

484
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,536
IT WOULD BE A BIG MOVE, BUT IT

485
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,622
MIGHT BE THE WRONG MOVE.

486
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,832
>> WILL, COULD YOU ENTERTAIN A

487
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,584
THOUGHT OF A FINAL THREE WITH ME

488
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:00,876
AND MAMA C?

489
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,673
>> I'VE ALREADY ENTERTAINED WITH

490
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,423
MAMA C.

491
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,049
YOU I HAVEN'T.

492
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,760
YOU'RE PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.

493
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,595
YOU COULD IMMUNITY UP UNTIL THE

494
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,221
FINAL THREE AND HAVE NOTHING TO

495
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,932
WORRY ABOUT.

496
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,141
MIKE'S SCRAMBLING BECAUSE HE

497
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,267
KNOWS HE'S NEXT ON THE CHOPPING

498
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:17,768
BLOCK.

499
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,144
HE'S<i> THE</i> BIGGEST THREAT STILL IN

500
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:19,895
THE GAME.

501
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,897
AND YOU GOT TO GET RID OF YOUR

502
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,231
BIGGEST THREAT.

503
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,318
>> THE ONLY THING I CAN ASK YOU,

504
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,861
MAN, HONEST TO GOD, PLEASE DO

505
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,363
NOT LET RODNEY BEAT ME IN THIS

506
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:29,571
GAME.

507
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,781
>> THAT WILL KILL ME.

508
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,866
>> HIS ASS GOT TO CALM DOWN.

509
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,368
HE'S STARTING TO GET ON MY

510
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:34,576
NERVES.

511
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,870
>> HE'S THE ONLY SURVIVOR THAT'S

512
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,122
TRIED TO GUILT EVERYONE INTO

513
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:38,580
GIVING HIM A REWARD.

514
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,249
>> HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL

515
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,250
BAD.

516
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,793
>> COURSE HE WAS.

517
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,087
>> BUT THEN I'M LIKE WAIT, IT'S

518
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,922
MY REWARD, I WON IT.

519
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:47,172
I'M GOING.

520
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,008
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE CAROLYN'S

521
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:50,634
HEAD IS AT.

522
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,553
I'M HOPING IT'S WITH ME, BUT IF

523
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,178
SHE'S NOT WITH ME AND SHE'S WITH

524
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,889
THEM, I HAVE TO WIN THE IMMUNITY

525
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,224
TO STAY IN THIS GAME.

526
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,934
>> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE

527
00:16:59,017 --> 00:16:59,143
NEEDED.

528
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,227
>> YEAH.

529
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:07,359
SURF AND TURF, MAN.

530
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,361
>> SURF AND TURF IS MY FAVORITE

531
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:09,570
MALE.

532
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,237
>> I DON'T WANT THE TALK ABOUT

533
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,781
IT, HONESTLY.

534
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,157
IT AGGRAVATES ME.

535
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,576
>> I'M JUST SO MAD, SIERRA.

536
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,827
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE DIDN'T GET

537
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,247
THAT TODAY.

538
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,875
MAMA C HAS WON A REWARD EVERY

539
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,417
OTHER DAY.

540
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,251
SHE SCREWED ME ON MY BIRTH DAY

541
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,795
AND WENT BACK ON HER WORD TODAY.

542
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,881
GUESS WHAT, MAMA C, MAYBE I

543
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,048
SHOULDN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY,

544
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:30,716
BUT I AM.

545
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,217
ONCE MIKE'S OUT OF HERE, YOU'RE

546
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:32,509
OUT OF HERE.

547
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,303
REVENGE IS GOING TO BE SWEET.

548
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,556
REVENGE IS GOING TO BE VERY

549
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,516
SWEET.

550
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,185
>> EVERYBODY'S HUNGRY, REALLY

551
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,312
HUNGRY, AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT

552
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,898
THEY'RE ON A SURF AND TURF

553
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,649
HELICOPTER REWARD, IT SURE WOULD

554
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,153
BE NICE TO FIND SOME FOOD,

555
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:51,445
SOMETHING.

556
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,988
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF A

557
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:53,238
FRUIT.

558
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,865
I DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA

559
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,951
AS TO WHAT THESE THINGS ARE, BUT

560
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,078
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT IF THEY

561
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,205
ARE RIGHT NOW.

562
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,458
>> GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.

563
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,127
THE GOOD NEWS IS I FOUND FRUIT.

564
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,214
THE BAD NEWS IS, I DON'T KNOW

565
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,508
WHETHER IT'S ANY GOOD OR NOT.

566
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,635
>> WHAT FRUIT DO YOU THINK THAT

567
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:14,802
IS?

568
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,261
>> I'M GOING TO CUT IT OPEN SO

569
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,139
WE CAN LOOK INSIDE OF IT.

570
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,850
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN DANO COMES

571
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,392
OUTS WITH TWO BIG PIECES OF

572
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:22,601
FRUIT.

573
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,228
>> THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

574
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,688
>> I FEEL LIKE I GOT A REWARD.

575
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,234
THAT'S LIKE THE WHOLE ENERGY

576
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,694
DIDN'T ENCHILADA FOR RODNEY.

577
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,987
WHAT HAVE I HAD?

578
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:34,446
RODNEY IS BACK.

579
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,156
THIS IS WHAT FOOD CAN DO TO YOU.

580
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,282
FOOD BRINGS PEOPLE CLOSER

581
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,785
TOGETHER AND YOU JUST BROUGHT ME

582
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,121
TWO WATERMELONS, BRO.

583
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,124
THESE WATERMELONS DAN FOUND ARE

584
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:45,749
MAKING RODNEY FEELING SOME TYPE

585
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,875
OF WAY.

586
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,501
ONCE I START FEELING LIKE, THIS

587
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,002
IT'S A RAP OUT HIRE.

588
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,379
>> SO WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME

589
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,006
BEIGE, MIKE AND THEN CAROLYN,

590
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,215
RIGHT?

591
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,051
>> ABSOLUTELY, 100%, PERIOD, END

592
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:56,301
OF STORY.

593
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,221
>> LET'S JUST GO OUT THERE AND

594
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,180
GET THE REDNECK OUT.

595
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,140
>> SO, MIKE, YOU WANT TO BATTLE

596
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,559
WITH ME, LET'S DO IT.

597
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,810
I'M READY TO BATTLE.

598
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,353
I'LL GO TOE TO TOE WITH ANYBODY

599
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,146
IN THIS GAME IN REAL LIFE.

600
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,231
I'M COMING AT YOU FULL FORCE.

601
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,024
WHEN I COME AT YOU FULL FORCE,

602
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,109
BABY, YOU BETTER WATCH OUT.

603
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,212
>> WE GOT TREE MAIL.

604
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:32,588
>> READ IT, GIRL.

605
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,173
>> WITH GOOD HAND-EYE

606
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,675
COORDINATION, YOUR PERFORMANCE

607
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,719
COULD AMAZE.

608
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,805
PATIENCE, SKILL AND A DELICATE

609
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,767
TOUCH DETERMINES WHO LEAVES OR

610
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:45,934
STAYS.

611
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,269
>> BRING IT ON, BABY.

612
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,729
>> BRING IT ON.

613
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,565
>> IF MIKE WINS THE NEXT

614
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,399
IMMUNITY, ONCE AGAIN THE FIVE

615
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,610
THAT ARE LEFT ARE GOING TO HAVE

616
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,446
TO THE TURN ON EACH OTHER.

617
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,363
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

618
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,365
MIKE CANNOT WIN THE NEXT

619
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,034
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

620
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:02,326
PERIOD.

621
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,243
END OF STORY.

622
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,580
END OF DISCUSSION.

623
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,331
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME

624
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:12,085
I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO CAROLYN AND

625
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:12,878
YOU TODAY AFTER THE CHALLENGE

626
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,255
AND EVERYTHING, BUT DAN CAN ONLY

627
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,215
BEAT THOSE TWO.

628
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:17,507
>> RIGHT.

629
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,509
>> SO, I MEAN, HE'S NOT TAKING

630
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,385
YOU AND HE'S IN THE TAKING

631
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,261
CAROLYN.

632
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,889
TODAY'S OUR LAST CHANCE TO HAVE

633
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,723
NUMBERS, BECAUSE IF THEY TAKE

634
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,643
YOU OUT, IF THEY TAKE CAROLYN

635
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,144
OUT, THOSE THREE GO TO THE END.

636
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:29,645
>> THEY'RE THE TOP THREE.

637
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,814
>> YEAH, AND IF ANY OF THEM MAKE

638
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,900
THE TOP THREE...

639
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,153
>> MAKE MAKES A GOOD POINT.

640
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,821
DAN DOES HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.

641
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,447
HE MAY USE IT TO GET ME OUT.

642
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,866
HE MAY USE IT TO HELP ME GET

643
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,116
FURTHER.

644
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,451
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT DAN'S GOING

645
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,703
TO DO, BUT IF MIKE DOESN'T WIN

646
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,579
IMMUNITY, HE HAS TO GO.

647
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,289
I DON'T WANT TO BE SITTING NEXT

648
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:49,706
TO MIKE IN THE END.

649
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,166
THAT WOULD BE SHOOTING MYSELF IN

650
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,458
THE FOOT.

651
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,127
>> IT'S OUR ONLY SHOT TO GET

652
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,253
THEM OUT OF THE GAME.

653
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:55,545
>> RIGHT.

654
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,673
>> HE'S BOUND TO LOSE, AND AT

655
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,800
THAT POINT, HE WILL BE GOING

656
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:08,392
HOME.

657
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:21,571
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

658
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,657
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

659
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,074
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

660
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:24,408
>> DEFINITELY.

661
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,827
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

662
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,035
CAROLYN.

663
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,036
I GOT TO TAKE IT BACK.

664
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,330
>> DON'T REALLY WANT YOU TO.

665
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,748
>> Jeff: YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO

666
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,249
LAST TIME.

667
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,458
>> NEW YORK I DIDN'T.

668
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,918
>> Jeff: WIN IT AGAIN.

669
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,838
>> ALL RIGHT.

670
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,547
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY

671
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,882
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

672
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,717
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

673
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,302

00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,847
RETRIEVE THREE BAGS.

675
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,389
EACH BAG CONTAINS A BALL.

676
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,725
WITNESS YOU HAVE ALL THREE BAG,

677
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:55,355
YOU WILL USE ONE OF THOSE BALLS

678
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,108
TO SOLVE A TABLE MAZE.

679
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,569
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS

WINNING THIS GAME WILL FALL

685
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,123
SHORT.

WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

687
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,667
WE'LL GET STARTED.

688
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,293

BAGS.

699
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,441
YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

700
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,610
THE ROPE FAR ENOUGH.

701
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,569

HE'S DRAGGING IT BACK.

711
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,092
SIERRA WITH ANOTHER NICE TOSS.

712
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,968

THERE'S MIKE WITH ANOTHER GOOD

717
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:17,813
TOSS.

718
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,942
CAN HE HOOK IT?

719
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,651
AND HE DOES.

740
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,065
WANT TO FINISH TOGETHER.

741
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,191

DAN MAKING SOME PROGRESS.

753
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,542
THEY'RE BOTH IN THE SAME SPOT

754
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,627
RIGHT NOW.

755
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,005
DAN HAS MADE UP A LOT OF TIME ON

756
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,464
THIS PUZZLE, NOW GAINING ON

757
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,591
MIKE.

758
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,884
MIKE DROPS.

759
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,635
HE'S GOT TO GO BACK TO THE

760
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,094
START.

761
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,388
THE TRICKY PART IS YOU'RE TRYING

762
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,514
TO RUSH TO BEAT THE OTHER GUY,

763
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,268
AND WHEN YOU RUSH, YOU MAKE

764
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:38,560
MISTAKES.

765
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:44,274
MIKE DROPS AGAIN.

766
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:44,816

SIERRA GOING TO GET IN ON THIS

768
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:46,943
NOW.

769
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,445
>> GOOD GOING, SIERRA.

770
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,322
>> Jeff: THREE BLUE COLLARS,

00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,448
MIKE, SIERRA AND DAN WORKING ON

772
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,616
THE TABLE MAZE.

773
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,327
RODNEY, CAROLYN AND WILL

774
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,914
STRUGGLE TO GET THEIR FINAL

775
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,456
BAGS.

776
00:24:59,539 --> 00:24:59,748
DAN DROPS.

777
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,540

00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,709
SIERRA NOW GETTING IN ON IT.

779
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,712
MIKE HAS BEEN DOING A NICE JOB

780
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,504
THIS ROUND.

781
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,132
HE'S BEEN VERY GOING VERY SLOW.

782
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,634
ANOTHER NICE MOVE BY MIKE.

783
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,053
THIS WOULD BE A HUGE WIN TO

784
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:13,720
GUARANTEE YOURSELF A SPOT IN

785
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,432
THAT FINAL FIVE.

786
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,600
THAT MUCH CLOSER TO THE MONEY.

787
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,478

789
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,273
WILL NOW CAN GET IN ON IT.

790
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,692
MIKE SLOW AND STEADY.

791
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,777
KNOWS HOW PAINFUL IT IS WHEN YOU

792
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,613
DROP AND HAVE TO START AGAIN.

793
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,614
DAN RUSHING NOW, TRYING THE

794
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,367

SIERRA STARTING TO GET THE HANG

796
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,453

MIKE GETTING CLOSER TO THAT

798
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,750
INNER CIRCLE BUT STILL PITFALLS

AWAIT.

800
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,170
NO EASY PATH THROUGH THIS MAZE.

801
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,464
NIKE WITH ANOTHER MIKE MANEUVER.

802
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,715

WILL DROPS.

806
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,594
HE'S GOT TO START AGAIN.

807
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,013
DAN HANGING IN THERE.

808
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,348
SIERRA HAS MADE UP A LOT OF

809
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,724
GROUND IN THIS CHALLENGE.

810
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,605
GAINING ON MIKE.

811
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,691
MIKE IS IN THE INNER CIRCLE.

812
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,278
JUST GOT TO DROP IT IN THAT

813
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:11,653
FINAL HOLE.

814
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,824
CAN HE DO IT FOR A SPOT IN THE

815
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,911
FINAL FIVE MIKE WAS IN THE HOLE.

816
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,371
HE'S BACK OUT.

817
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:25,917
SIERRA NOW GETTING CLOSER TO

818
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,668

819
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,714
MIKE IN AND OUT ONCE AGAIN.

820
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,425
HERE COMES SIERRA.

821
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,885
SHE'S IN THE INNER CIRCLE.

822
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:41,433
WE ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW.

823
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,810

THANK YOU, JESUS.

828
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,202

AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, WILL,

833
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:16,468
SIERRA, RODNEY, DAN, CAROLYN,

00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,804
AFTER 35 TOUGH DAYS OF SLEEPLESS

835
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,182
NIGHTS, PHYSICAL AND PENAL

836
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,558
EXHAUSTION, YOUR DREAM OF

837
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,809
WINNING THIS GAME AND $1 MILLION

838
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,395
WILL FALL SHORT.

839
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,980
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE VOTED

840
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,941
OUT TONIGHT AND JOIN THE JURY.

841
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,693
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

842
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,195
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

843
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,529
SEE YOU TONIGHT ON TRIBAL

844
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:36,738
COUNCIL.

845
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,697
>> INSIDE OF ME IT WAS LIKE THE

846
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,575
FOURTH OF JULY IN THE MIDDLE OF

847
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,534
TEXAS, FIREWORKS GOING OFF,

848
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,828
MUSIC PLAYING LOUD BECAUSE THIS

849
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,788
LITTLE NECKLACE RIGHT HERE SAYS

850
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,123
ONE OF THOSE FIVE ARE GOING HOME

851
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,208
TONIGHT.

852
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,292
AND IT'S NOT ME.

853
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,701
>> HOLD ON, MIKE.

854
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,869
>> GOOD LORD.

855
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,747
THIS GUY IS UNBEATABLE.

856
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,790
>> THAT WAS CRAZY.

857
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,877
>> MIKE LIVES ANOTHER DAY.

858
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,003
>> I KNOW.

859
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,713
YOU GET THE FIRE STOKED.

860
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,548
I'LL GO GET SOME WATER.

861
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,424
>> WORKING ON IT.

862
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,925
>> THE ALLIANZ ALL THE KNEW THAT

863
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,760
EVENTUALLY WE WERE GOING TO HAVE

864
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,303
TO TURN ON EACH OTHER.

865
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,431
AND IN MY PECKING ORDER, CAROLYN

866
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,225
WAS NEXT ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

867
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:51,062
SHE'S KICKED ASS IN CHALLENGES.

868
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:51,855
SHE'S BEEN PERSONABLE, SO SHE'S

869
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:55,483
GOT TO GO.

870
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,026
>> WE ALREADY KNOW WHO WE'RE

871
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,318
VOTING FOR.

872
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,736
>> CAROLYN?

873
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:58,987
>> YEAH.

874
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,779
>> CAROLYN?

875
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,280
>> YES.

876
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,114
>> CAROLYN?

877
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:01,448
>> YES.

878
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,407
>> CAROLYN?

879
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,700
>> YES.

880
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,953
>> JUST DON'T LET HER GET WIND

881
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,245
OF IT.

882
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,830
>> IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S CAROLYN,

883
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,999
BUT DAN IS A HUGE THREAT AND HAS

884
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,375
AN ADVANTAGE, AND IF WE'RE

885
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,751
PLAYING THIS GAME LIKE WE'VE

886
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,919
PLAYED IT THE WHOLE TIME TO GET

887
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,713
RID OF THE HUGE THREATS, MAYBE

888
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:17,964
WE NEED TO GET RID OF DAN.

889
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,009
>> NO SCRAMBLING, NO RUNNING

890
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,259
AROUND.

891
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,635
>> ONE IN FIVE CHANCE, BABY.

892
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,597
>> HERE COMES MIKE.

893
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,973
>> WANT TO SEE IF I CAN FIND

894
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:27,182
SOME.

895
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:32,020
>> WE'RE OUT OF FIREWOOD.

896
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:43,114
>> WE'RE OUT OF FIREWOOD.

897
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,991
>> DANO.

898
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,203
>> WHAT?

899
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,080
>> I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

900
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,916
>> HE'S REALLY THE BIGGEST

901
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,709
THREAT IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW

902
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,628
BECAUSE HE HAS AN ADVANTAGE.

903
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,004
>> THEIR LITTLE FAMILY IS

904
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,256
TURNING ON DAN.

905
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,299
EVERYONE IS SAYING VOTE DAN,

906
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,718
VOTE DAN, VOTE DAN.

907
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,929
WELL, IF THEY ALL WANT DAN GONE,

908
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:10,517
IT MAKES ME PAUSE AND THINK,

909
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,021
WHAT IF I GET RID OF ONE OF THEM

910
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,439
INSTEAD JUST TO COMPLETELY MESS

911
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,941
WITH THEIR PLANS AND NOT GO

912
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,609
ALONG WITH WHAT THEY WANT DONE.

913
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:25,823
>> ALL RIGHT.

914
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,158
>> HERE'S THE DEAL, I CAN GET

915
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,993
RID OF YOU TONIGHT EASILY.

916
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:29,410
EASILY.

917
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,703
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DO

918
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:30,954
ANYTHING.

919
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,956
I CAN THROW MY VOTE AWAY AND

920
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,373
YOU'RE GOING HOME.

921
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,751
YOUR ALLIANCE, YOUR ALLIANCE, IS

922
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:37,669
GUNNING FOR YOU.

923
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,294
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ABOUT IT

924
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:38,962
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING HOME

925
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,464
TONIGHT UNLESS I CHANGE

926
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:41,756
SOMETHING.

927
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,093
>> MIKE HAS THE AUDACITY, THE

928
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,470
UNMITIGATED GALL TO LOOK AT ME

929
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,055
AND SAY, I CAN SAVE YOU.

930
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,975
I HAVE THE POWER TO SAVE YOU.

931
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,726
>> HOW CAN I BELIEVE YOU IN

932
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,686
YOU'RE GIVING ME NOTHING.

933
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:54,978
>> OKAY.

934
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,647
>> BUT PART OF ME IS ACTUALLY

935
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,940
WONDERING IF THERE IS A CHANCE

936
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,941
THEY'LL TURN ON ME.

937
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,359
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO USE

938
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,026
MY ADVANTAGE, AND I'D RATHER GO

939
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,487
DOWN SWINGING THAN STAND THERE

940
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,240
AND WATCH THE THIRD STRIKE GO BY

941
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:07,615
ME.

942
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,075
>> MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

943
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:09,909
MAYBE EVERYBODY'S LYING TO YOU.

944
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,036
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

945
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,662
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

946
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:12,912
>> OKAY.

947
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,622
>> MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

948
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,123
MAYBE I'LL GO HOME WITH AN

949
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,459
ADVANTAGE IN MY POCKET AND AN

950
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:18,835
AWESOME SOUVENIR.

951
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,920
>> DAN WAS NOT SHAKEN AT ALL.

952
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:21,254
HE WAS UPPITY.

953
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,880
HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HE'S GOING

954
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:23,172
HOME.

955
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,258
THE ONLY THING I CAN FIGURE OUT

956
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,136
IS DAN WANTS TO TAKE WILL AND

957
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:28,970
RODNEY TO THE END BECAUSE THOSE

958
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,681
ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE HE CAN

959
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,433
BEAT, AND IF I'M RIGHT AND HE'S

960
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,309
NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT, IT'S ONE

961
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,019
OF THE GIRLS.

962
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,813
>> IF THE BOYS ARE TELLING THE

963
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,232
TRUTH, WHICH I HONESTLY BELIEVE

964
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:41,691
THEY ARE...

965
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,317
>> RIGHT.

966
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,110
>> THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR

967
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:44,402
DAN.

968
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,153
>> HEY --

969
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,322
>> OH, MY GOSH, YOU SCARED THE

970
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:47,780
LIVING CRAP OUT OF ME.

971
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,324
>> REALLY FAST.

972
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,785
LOOK WHO IS IN THE SHELTER

973
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,036
SLEEPING.

974
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,788
>> DAN AND RODNEY.

975
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,623
THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU

976
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,082
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT A TRIBAL

977
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,500
NAME.

978
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,502
WHO FEELS SAFE, WHO DOESN'T?

979
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,006
THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE

980
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,924
"SURVIVOR" CODE FOR "I AIN'T

981
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,385
GOING NOWHERE.

982
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,053
I DON'T NEED TO DO NOTHING."

983
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,764
DAN IS VOTING ONE OF YOU TWO

984
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,017
TONIGHT WITH THE BOYS.

985
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,602
ONE MILLION PERCENT.

986
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,144
ONE MILLION PERCENT.

987
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,064
I THINK IT'S YOU TONIGHT.

988
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,358
I'M GOING TO LET YOU GUYS FINISH

989
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:23,941
TALKING.

990
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:24,984
I'M GOING TO GRAB MY STUFF.

991
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:29,530
I --

992
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,866
>> I MEAN, I THINK HE'S PSYCHOO.

993
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:32,659
HE'S PARANOID.

994
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,201
THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM IN THIS

995
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,702
POSITION IN THE FIRST PLACE.

996
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,453
>> I THINK SO.

997
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,038
>> I WANT TO BELIEVE THEY'RE

998
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,915
VOTING FOR DAN, BUT WHAT IF THEY

999
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,374
DON'T VOTE FOR DAN?

1000
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,668
WHAT IF MIKE IS RIGHT?

1001
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,002
IT COULD BE WILL, RODNEY AND DAN

1002
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:43,294
FINAL THREE.

1003
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,922
THEY COULD BE SCREWING US OVER

1004
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,757
AND THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY

1005
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,803
RACKING MY BRAIN IS DO I TRUST

1006
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,011
THEM?

1007
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,472
I DON'T WANT THE WASTE MY IDOL,

1008
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,890
AND IF I REALLY BELIEVE THEY'RE

1009
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,685
GOING TO VOTE FOR DAN, THEN I

1010
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:10,780
CAN SAVE IT FOR ONE MORE VOTE.

1011
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,708
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1012
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:26,587
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1013
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,841
HALI, JOE, JENN, SHIRIN AND

1014
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,342
TYLER VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1015
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,679
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1016
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,179
ALL RIGHT.

1017
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,682
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TRUST.

1018
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,393
MIKE, YOU GO BACK TO CAMP AGAIN

1019
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,144
WITH IMMUNITY, WHICH GIVES YOU A

1020
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,229
VANTAGE POINT OF NOT HAVING TO

1021
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,398
WORRY AS MUCH TONIGHT.

1022
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,816
SO BASED ON WHAT YOU SAW THIS

1023
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,608
AFTERNOON, WOULD YOU SAY THIS IS

1024
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,986
A GROUP OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM THERE

1025
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:50,820
IS SOME TRUST?

1026
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,655
>> I DEFINITELY THINK THERE'S A

1027
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,906
COUPLE PEOPLE THAT PROBABLY

1028
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,158
AREN'T FEELING AS TRUSTWORTHY OR

1029
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,618
AS TRUSTED, BUT THEY STILL HAVE

1030
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,746
A COMMON ENEMY, THIS GUY RIGHT

1031
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,121
HERE.

1032
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,247
IF YOU HAVE A COMMON ENEMY, IT'S

1033
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,124
EASY TO BOND WITH OTHER PEOPLE,

1034
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,085
BUT TONIGHT ONE OF FIVE OF THEIR

1035
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,170
ALLIANCE IS GOING HOME.

1036
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,172
SO, YEAH, THERE WAS SOME

1037
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,298
SCRAMBLING GOING ON TODAY AT

1038
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:10,590
CAMP.

1039
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,132
>> Jeff: RODNEY, WHERE IS

1040
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,718
TRUST FOR YOU AT THIS POINT IN

1041
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,135
THE CAME?

1042
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:20,266
>> DAY 35, TRUST IS... TRUST

1043
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,267
IS... LET ME THINK.

1044
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,186
I'M KIND OF LIKE OUT OF MY MIND

1045
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,938
RIGHT NOW A LITTLE BIT.

1046
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,065
>> Jeff: IS THIS A SIGN OF

1047
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,316
FATIGUE?

1048
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,484
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1049
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,777
>> Jeff: SO YOUR BRAIN REALLY

1050
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,402
HAS TO WORK HARD TO TRY TO FORM

1051
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,321
A SENTENCE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST

1052
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:33,613
DEPLETED.

1053
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,282
>> WHEN YOU HAVE VERY LIMITED

1054
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,659
FOOD, SOMETIMES THAT CAN AFFECT

1055
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,202
YOUR DECISION MAKING.

1056
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,037
WHEN YOU'RE VERY FATIGUED AND

1057
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,246
YOU GO INTO AN IMMUNITY

1058
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,873
CHALLENGE AND YOU CAN'T REALLY

1059
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:44,999
PERFORM BECAUSE YOUR HEAD IS NOT

1060
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,125
THERE, IT CAN GET A LITTLE HARD

1061
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,210
ON YOU.

1062
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,338
SO WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN?

1063
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,257
[LAUGHTER]

1064
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,717
>> Jeff: ARE YOU AT A POINT IN

1065
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,386
THE GAME WHERE YOU TRUST IN THE

1066
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,971
RELATIONSHIPS YOU'VE MADE?

1067
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,098
>> WELL, IT'S DAY 35.

1068
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,351
LET'S BE HONEST, YOU JUST ARE

1069
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,936
AROUND THE SAME PEOPLE 24/7.

1070
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,688
I CAN'T EVEN BE WITH MY MOTHER

1071
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,898
24/7 WITHOUT WANTING TO RING HER

1072
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,441
NECK AND I LOVE HER TO DEATH.

1073
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,734
SO ONE MINUTE YOU THINK YOU CAN

1074
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,193
TRUST THEM.

1075
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,736
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY COULD BE

1076
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,612
FORMING ANOTHER ALLIANCE.

1077
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,280
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE

1078
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,616
TO GO WITH THE PEOPLE YOU DID

1079
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,117
FORM YOUR ALLIANCES WITH AND

1080
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:20,743
HOPEFULLY THOSE ARE THE VOTES ON

1081
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,661
YOUR SIDE TONIGHT.

1082
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,621
>> CAROLYN, ARE YOU IN A

1083
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,789
SITUATION WHERE YOU THINK, YEAH,

1084
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,042
I TRUST MY ALLIANCES OR I JUST

1085
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:28,668
CAN'T AFFORD TO TRUST ANYBODY?

1086
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,878
>> YOU WANT TO TRUST THE PEOPLE

1087
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,505
WHO YOU WANT TO TRUST, BUT I

1088
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,215
KNOW MY HEAD'S ON THE CHOPPING

1089
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,174
BLOCK TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE

1090
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,176
ARE GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU

1091
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,178
WANT TO HEAR BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL

1092
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,680
SCRAMBLING TO SAVE THEMSELVES,

1093
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,641
SO I AM VERY, VERY NERVOUS

1094
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,350
TONIGHT.

1095
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,644
>> Jeff: DAN, DOES CAROLYN

1096
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,979
HAVE A REASON TO BE CONCERNED

1097
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:48,980
FROM A THREAT STANDPOINT BECAUSE

1098
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,857
YOU CAN'T TAKE OUT MIKE AND

1099
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,233
CAROLYN HAS SHOWN HERSELF TO BE

1100
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,569
PRETTY DOMINANT IN CHALLENGES.

1101
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,654
>> YEAH, CAROLYN HAS DEFINITELY

1102
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,613
PROVEN HERSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN,

1103
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,364
BUT SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH

1104
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,783
HER HEAD ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

1105
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,285
MY NAME HAS COME UP A LOT IN

1106
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,786
THIS GAME.

1107
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,412
>> Jeff: DID YOU HEAR IT THIS

1108
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:04,662
AFTERNOON?

1109
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,122
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1110
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,541
AND THERE'S A TIME TO MAKE A

1111
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,168
MOVE AND THERE'S A TIME... I

1112
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,087
KNOW THIS ANSWER SUCKS BECAUSE

1113
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:13,629
IT'S A POLITICAL WAFFLING

1114
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,339
ANSWER, I CAN MAKE A MOVE OR I

1115
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,340
CAN STAY WHERE I AM.

1116
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,093
YOU KNOW, FIVE OF US ARE STILL

1117
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:19,552
HERE.

1118
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,386
BUT NOT AFTER TONIGHT WE WON'T

1119
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,179
BE.

1120
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,347
>> Jeff: WILL, DOES THAT ALARM

1121
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,682
YOU WHEN YOU HEAR DAN ACTUALLY

1122
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,642
SAY IT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

1123
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,060
AND I'M AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING.

1124
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,228
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1125
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,606
I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MIKE

1126
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,608
CONTINUING TO WIN IMMUNITY IS

1127
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,192
DIGGING INTO OUR NUMBERS AND DAN

1128
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,778
STILL HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THIS

1129
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,404
GAME, BUT WE HAVE NO CLUE WHAT

1130
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,364
IT'S GOING TO DO.

1131
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,825
>> Jeff: AND RODNEY, HAVING AN

1132
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,409
ADVANTAGE GIVES YOU A LOT OF

1133
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,494
POWER, BUT THE REAL TRICK IS

1134
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,287
WHEN DO YOU PLAY IT?

1135
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,373
>> THE ADVANTAGE IS LIKE A

1136
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:49,916
STRONG-ARM TACTIC.

1137
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,459
YOU CAN SAY I'M GOING TO USE IT

1138
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,002
TONIGHT AND LET IT BE KNOWN, OR

1139
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,170
YOU CAN KEEP IT IN YOUR BACK

1140
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,338
POCKET AND NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT

1141
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,464
IT.

1142
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,174
SO NOW YOU'RE AT FIVE AND YOU

1143
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,176
USE IT AND IT GETS MORE SCARY

1144
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,552
BECAUSE IT COULD BE YOU THAT'S

1145
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,136
GOING HOME.

1146
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,346
>> Jeff: SIERRA, HOW MUCH TALK

1147
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,722
HAS THERE BEEN ABOUT ADVANTAGES

1148
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,473
AND IDOLS AND WILL THEY BE

1149
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,891
PLAYED TONIGHT?

1150
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,935
>> JEFF, THERE WAS TONS OF TALK.

1151
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,686
YOU DON'T WANT TO WALK OUT THE

1152
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,104
DOOR WITH SOMETHING IN YOUR BAG

1153
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:12,563
YOU COULD HAVE PLAYED.

1154
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,774
>> Jeff: AND YET, DAN, YOU

1155
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,275
COULD STRONG ARM, LIKE RODNEY

1156
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,027
SAID, AND TRY TO BUY YOURSELF

1157
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,319
ANOTHER DAY.

1158
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,987
>> TONIGHT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT

1159
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,321
NIGHT TO USE IT.

1160
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,907
BUT THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL

1161
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,492
MIGHT BE EVEN BETTER.

1162
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,993
IT MIGHT GET ME TO THAT FINAL

1163
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,619
FOUR.

1164
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,329
HONEST TO GOD, I'M LIKE A

1165
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,288
METRONOME GOING BACK AND FORTH

1166
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,831
UK BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND

1167
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,208
FORTH, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

1168
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:36,003
RIGHT THING TO DO IS.

1169
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,587
>> Jeff: WELL, IT'S TIME TO

1170
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,465
FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

1171
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:39,799
TONIGHT.

1172
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,425
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1173
00:37:41,509 --> 00:38:00,444
DAN, YOU'RE UP.

1174
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,252
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1175
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,422
>> EXCUSE ME.

1176
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,339
JEFF,'D RATHER GO DOWN SWINGING

1177
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,340
THAN STAND THERE AND WATCH

1178
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:26,095
STRIKE THREE GO BY.

1179
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:26,887
I'D LIKE THE PLAY MY ADVANTAGE

1180
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:33,019
PLEASE.

1181
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:33,561
>> Jeff: THE ADVANTAGE THAT

1182
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,271
DAN BOUGHT IN THE AUCTION WAS

1183
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:35,813
ANOTHER VOTE.

1184
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,522
THE VOTE HAS THE SAME POWER AS

1185
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,483
ANY OTHER VOTE CAST AT TRIBAL

1186
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,402
COUNCIL, WHICH MEANS TONIGHT

1187
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,821
THERE WILL BE SEVEN VOTES CAST.

1188
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:55,499
DAN, GO CAST IT.

1189
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:14,977
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1190
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,189
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1191
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,440
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1192
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:25,946
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1193
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,406
>> I'M NOT TAKING A CHANCE,

1194
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,494
JEFF.

1195
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:40,503
I'M NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1196
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,427
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN

1197
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,055
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1198
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,807
ANY VOTES CAST FOR CAROLYN WILL

1199
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,808
NOT COUNT.

1200
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:58,479
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1201
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,649
FIRST VOTE CAROLYN.

1202
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,274

1203
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,610
DOES NOT COUNT.

1204
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,236
CAROLYN.

1205
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,613

DAN.

1214
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:32,888
THAT'S ONE VOTE DAN.

1215

13th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

1216
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:35,766
SIXTH MEMBER OF THE JURY, DAN.

1217
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,476
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1218
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:54,535

1219
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,036
>> Jeff: DAN, THE TRIBE HAS

1220
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,705
SPOKEN.

1221
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:08,757
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1222
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,301
WELL, WE STARTED THIS GAME WITH

1223
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:14,138
THREE TRIBES, 35 DAYS LATER,

1224
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,306
REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH TRIBE

1225
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,265
STILL LEFT IN THE GAME.

1226
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,976
IT IS ANYBODY'S GAME TO WIN.

1227
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,311
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1228
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:20,728
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1229
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,814
GOOD NIGHT.

1230
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,743
STAY TUNED FROM SCENES FROM OUR

1231
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,827
NEXT EPISODE.

>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON A

1233
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:43,834
SPECIAL TWO-HOUR SEASON FINALE.

1234
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,960
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US YOU

1235
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:45,294
HAD THE IDOL.

1236
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,214
>> WHY DID YOU VOTE FOR ME?

1237
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,673
>> Jeff: WITH ONLY FOUR DAYS

1238
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,382
LEFT, WORLDS COLLIDE.

1239
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,676
>> LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

1240
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,219
DO NOT PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN.

1241
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,345
>> I'M SCARED.

1242
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:54,929
>> WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY.

1243
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,681
>> THIS IS A $1 MILLION MISTAKE.

1244
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,516
>> Jeff: JOIN US FOR THE

1245
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:07,358
FINALE

1246
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,859
>> I CAME OUT HERE WITH THREE

1247
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:09,985
THINGS THE DO.

1248
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,986
NUMBER ONE, HAVE FUN.

1249
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,446
NUMBER TWO, BE REMEMBERED.

1250
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:13,072
NUMBER THREE, HOPEFULLY WIN THIS

1251
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,990
GAME.

1252
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,077
BUT AS LONG AS I MADE THE FIRST

1253
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,702
TWO, I'M STILL OKAY WITH THAT.

1254
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,287
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT GOES.

1255
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,205
EVERY DAY I WAS HERE WAS A DREAM

1256
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:21,747
COME TRUE FOR ME.

1257
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,665
I PLAYED A GOOD GAME.

1258
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,667
I PLAYED A RESPECTABLE GAME.

1259
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,751
I GOT NO REGRETS.
