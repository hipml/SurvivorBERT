JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,130
<i>Clay gave Jake</i>
<i>a piece of his mind.</i>

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,923
I didn't like that statement

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,591
worth a ... up at that
council meeting.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,428
I'll put my production up,
basically, against anybody's.

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,179
<i>And that offended Clay.</i>

7
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,723
PROBST:<i> The tribe was</i>
<i>surprised to find</i>

8
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,934
<i>their loved</i>
<i>ones at the reward challenge.</i>

9
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>But even more surprised</i>
<i>when the family members</i>

10
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>had to compete</i>
<i>against each other.</i>

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,481
There's that juice.

12
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,610
<i>It was Helen's husband Jim</i>
<i>who stomached the victory</i>

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,238
<i>and became an honorary tribe</i>
<i>member for a day.</i>

14
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,615
<i>With Jim as a confidant,</i>

15
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,326
<i>Helen had a chance</i>
<i>to talk about strategy.</i>

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,912
Brian'll play fair; Clay won't.

17
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,289
Clay's a selfish son of a gun.

18
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,999
PROBST:
<i>At the immunity challenge,</i>

19
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,751
<i>the tribe was</i>
<i>surprised again.</i>

20
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,462
-No!
-(shouting)

21
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,297
PROBST:<i> This time, castaways</i>
<i>and family members</i>

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,757
<i>competed together,</i>

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,426
<i>and brotherly teamwork</i>
<i>paid off for Ted.</i>

24
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,595
-Big Ted!
-(shouting)

25
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,805
<i>Before Tribal Council,</i>
<i>Helen approached Brian</i>

26
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,433
<i>with her concerns about Clay.</i>

27
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,809
Do you feel that he has

28
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,021
earned a number one or two spot?

29
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,440
PROBST:<i> At Tribal Council,</i>
<i>despite a campaign</i>

30
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,649
<i>to get rid of Clay,</i>

31
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,777
<i>Jake was voted out</i>
<i>of the tribe.</i>

32
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,903
The tribe has spoken.

33
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,615
<i>The five former members</i>
<i>of Chuay Gahn</i>

34
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,241

<i>Tonight, one of them will go.</i>

36
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,101
JAN:
34 days.

37
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,145
Five to go.

38
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,731
HELEN:<i> We haven't been</i>
<i>to Tribal Council</i>

39
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:13,234
<i>to vote off a Chuay Gahn</i>
<i>member since day 12.</i>

40
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,113
Chuay Gahn, who started out as
the joke team of<i> Survivor,</i>

41
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,782
<i>as the losers,</i>
<i>as the old people,</i>

42
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,159
<i>as the ones</i>
<i>that, you know what,</i>

43
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,577
<i>"You band of misfits,</i>

44

<i>you can't</i>
<i>do anything right."</i>

45
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,457
But we never lost focus
and we never gave up.

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,627
TED: The core of Chuay Gahn

47
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,794
CLAY:
Yep.

48
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,505
If it wasn't for us,

49
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,007
we would have been extinct.

50
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,427
HELEN:<i> And now, definitely,</i>

52
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,306
<i>now we have to vote</i>
<i>each other out.</i>

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,432
<i>The game is on,</i>

54
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,767

55
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,311

56
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,146
BRIAN:
<i>What skills come into play</i>

57
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,689
<i>at this part of the game?</i>

58
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,442
Skating skills.
Who's the best skater?

59
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,401
Ice skater.

60
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,362
<i>Who's got</i>
<i>the longest skates on,</i>

61
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:01,491
<i>who's the best at cutting</i>
<i>corners, going around circles?</i>

62
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,952
Because usually on skating you
got to be ice cold.

63
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,537
<i>You can't lose your cool,</i>
<i>you got to be like ice.</i>

64
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,622
<i>You're going to have</i>
<i>friendships,</i>

65
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,457
<i>you got to cut off</i>
<i>those friendships.</i>

66
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,541
<i>You got to keep</i>
<i>stringing people along,</i>

67
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,627
<i>and-- bam!--</i>
<i>throw them a nice slider.</i>

68
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,129
Mr. Freeze is in the house.

69
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,676
Even though it's about 110 out
here, I've got my skates on.

with, uh, everyone else.

172
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,053
So it might be every man
for himself,

173
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,221
keep on your toes sort of thing,

174
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,556
-you know what I'm saying?
-Yeah, yeah.

175
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,682
I don't know...

176
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,184
Do I need to watch out
for anything?

177
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,352
I don't know yet.
I'm wondering about myself, too.

178
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,396
TED:<i> Um, I think Brian</i>
<i>is a good guy.</i>

179
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,023
<i>Um, him and I had a verbal</i>

180
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,026
alliance, um, and it was strong,

181
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,778
but I don't think
it's as strong anymore.

182
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,615
I have a feeling Clay
is going to try to get me.

183
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,450
Well, I'm not sure who
that threesome is.

184
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,202
-That's all I'm saying.
-Right.

185
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,786
That's all I can...
that's the feeling.

186
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,246
TED:

187

188
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,212
He kind of wavered a little bit,
and to me we've always operated

189
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,090
in a mode that, um,
our plans have been solid.

190
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,342
-I know...
-Now, you're not telling me

191
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,927
-that you're going to flip on
me, are you? - No, no, I know

192
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,428
when you got
to go down to the wire,

193
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,930
I would expect you to do
something against me

194
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,765
as opposed to, you know,
I wouldn't want...

195
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,391
-Right, right, right. -You know,
just... it's just business.

196
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,768
You're not flipping
on me, are you?

197
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,769
-No. I'm just saying.
-Okay, okay.

198
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,020
-I'm just saying this is
business. No. -Gotcha.

199
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,063
We're friends.

202
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:51,447

saying that he's wavering

203
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,659

that something has changed.

204

Lookee, lookee, lookee!

We haven't even opened it.

206
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,622
We haven't opened it.
I just opened it.

207
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,123
-It looks like a book.
-JAN: Oh!

208
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,459
-Oh, my gosh. Quite a book.
-Oh, this is cool.

215
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,147
"...and wait, there's
a whole lot more."

216
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,482

00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,656
Well, that's me.
Who's always asking about food?

220
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,533
-So y'all just...
-You don't get any more food!

221
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,618
You've already had yours.

222
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,495
You've had your food.
Sorry, so you're done.

230
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,403
<i>So I wanted to communicate</i>
<i>with Helen</i>

231

232

<i>in the final four,</i>

236
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,713

<i>Clay doesn't do anything.</i>
<i>He lays around all day.</i>

244
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,192
<i>He doesn't go out, get wood.</i>

245
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,195
<i>He doesn't go out for the</i>

246
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,280
<i>He just lays around all day,</i>
<i>so...</i>

247
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,449
<i>So logically, he would be</i>
<i>the next, in my mind,</i>

248

<i>the next person</i>
<i>to get voted out.</i>

What do you think of the ride?

252
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,922
Let's go.
Big Ted, take the front.

253
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,508
Oh!

254
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,009
Lord have mercy.

255
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,221
Get on in, baby.
This is what you're playing for.

256
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,139
-Oh, my God!
-Ow!

257
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,058
HELEN:
Oh, it's got that new car smell.

258
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,309
JAN:
Whoa!

259
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,311
Ah!

260
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,230
Kind of a heavy foot there.

261
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,274
(screaming)

262
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,318
This is what I'm talking about.

263
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,778
CLAY:
Whoa!

264
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,948
JAN:
Oh, my God.

265
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,325
I don't want to get out.
It fits too good.

266
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,244
Hop out. We got a
challenge to do.

267
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,290
First things first.

268
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,252
Let's talk about this SUV.
Not a bad-looking ride, huh?

269
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,129
-JAN: Uh-uh. Gorgeous.
-Perfect. Perfect.

270
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,965
The winner will win
the Chevy Trail Blazer.

271
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,426
The other part of the reward is

272
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,803
a day at a spa,<i> Survivor</i>
style.

273
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,846
Ah...

274
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,973
-We've also arranged
for a nice massage. -(gasps)

275
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,809
And what would a day at the spa
be without food?

276
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,186
Nice, big Thai meal.

277
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,813
Could be a huge advantage

278
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,523
going into the last five days.

279
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,524
Worth playing for?

280
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,317
-Yes, yes.
-CLAY: Yes, sir.

281
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,278
Here's the challenge.
It is a race.

282
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,155
Your goal: collect
and unscramble

283
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,158
a collection of letters
that spell an activity.

284
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,284
Here's how it works.

285
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,453
<i>At the start, you're going</i>
<i>to be standing</i>

286
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,830
<i>on your first of eight</i>
<i>English letters.</i>

287
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,999
<i>Unlash it, move to a trough.</i>

288
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,042
<i>Mixed in with</i>
<i>a bunch of Thai symbols</i>

289
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,212
<i>you will each find an</i>
<i>underscored English letter.</i>

290
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>Once you find your second</i>
<i>letter, move on.</i>

291
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,467
<i>You'll then come to a group</i>
<i>of flag poles.</i>

292
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,845
<i>Choose one, untie it.</i>
<i>Your next letter will release.</i>

293
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,014
The third stop: cargo net.

294
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,184
<i>Get up the cargo net,</i>
<i>get your letter, get down.</i>

295
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,020
<i>Around the corner,</i>
<i>you'll find a tree.</i>

296
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,063
<i>Again, Thai symbols</i>
<i>and English letters.</i>

297
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,857
<i>This time they are covered</i>
<i>in silk.</i>

298
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,652
<i>Start uncovering them until you</i>
<i>find another English letter.</i>

299
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,155
<i>You're then going to move</i>
<i>to a rope pole.</i>

300
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,200
<i>There are 17 ropes,</i>
<i>but only five of the rope poles</i>

301
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,868
<i>lead to an English letter.</i>

302
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,537
<i>This time attached</i>
<i>to the letter is a key.</i>

303
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,499
<i>Take the letter and the key</i>
<i>and move to a treasure chest.</i>

304
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,001
<i>Use the key to unlock</i>
<i>the treasure chest.</i>

305
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,544
At the bottom
of the treasure chest

306
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,672
you'll find
the two last letters.

307
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,174
You'll then race
to one of the easels,

308
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,550
like the one you're
standing in front of,

309
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,885
and unscramble the letters

310
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,763
of two words
that describe an activity.

311
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,890
First person to unscramble
them correctly

312
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,810
wins the Chevy Trail Blazer,
the day at the spa,

313
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,187
a break from the game.

314
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,856
Let's head over to the start.
We'll get going.

315
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,359
Here we go, guys,
great reward at stake.

316
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,027
You are looking
for eight letters total.

317
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,403
You're standing on
the first one.

318
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,446
Survivors ready?

319
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,073
-JAN: Yeah.
-Go!

320
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,118
You're standing on
the first one, guys.

321
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,246
You're standing
on the first one.

322
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,956
-Clay, you're right. -That's
what I thought I heard you say.

323
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,624
I wasn't for sure.

324
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,173
PROBST:
Clay's got his first one.

325
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,804
Where we going? Jeff?

326
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,556
-Got to go back to get your
first one, Brian. -Man, hey!

327
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,224
-Got one underneath you.
-I said you're standing

328
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,392
-on your first one.
-Oh.

329
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,731
Looking for the underscore.

330
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,443
Looking for an underscore.

331
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,821
Underscore means English letter.

332
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,031
Helen's got two.

333
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,580
Ted's got two.

334
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,999
Brian's got two, Clay's got two.

335
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,835
It's a tight race.

336
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,753
All you're doing here
is untying.

337
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,297
Drop the letter.

338
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,427
Helen has her third letter.

339
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,929
Ted's got his third letter.
Clay's got his third letter.

340
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,056
Brian's got his third letter.

341
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,820
Jan, don't give up!
You're still alive!

342
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:07,156
Everybody's got four except Jan.

343
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,825
You're looking for another
letter; remember the underscore.

344
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,661
Clay's got his fifth letter,
and he's off.

345
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,663
Brian's got his fifth.

346
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,005
Clay, you got lucky
on your first one.

347
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,008
Nope, try again, Brian.

348
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,847
Brian's got one.
Take the letter and the key.

349
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,683
The last two letters are in
the treasure chest.

350
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,185
-(Brian sighs) -Nice little
surprise in there, huh?

351
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,811
-Looks like dinner, huh?
-CLAY: Squid.

352
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,356
Moving to an easel.
Start solving them.

353
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,693
Two words that form an activity
when you put them together.

354
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:48,906
Underscore will be
on the bottom, remember.

355
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:59,041
Two words when put together
are an activity.

356
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,631
-Two words, English.
-I got it right here, Jeff.

357
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,882
PROBST:
Brian thinks he has it.

358
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,345
What are you spelling?

359
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,721
"Road trip."

360
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,972
That's not "road trip."

361
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,143
Got it! Got it!

362
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,854
Look at it.

363
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,564
"Road trip."

364
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,526
-Ted wins reward!
-Yeah, yeah, baby!

365
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,278
That was ballgame!
We got a truck, baby!

366
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,905
Yes! Yes!

367
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,616
-Damn.
-HELEN: What was it, Ted?

368
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,160
-You, baby! For you, baby!
-Ted, what was the word?

369
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,745
Shouldn't have yelled it out.
Good job, buddy.

370
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,705
HELEN:
Road trip.

371
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,581
No problem, that was for you.
Good job.

372
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,708
Congratulations.

373
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,586
Way to go, Ted.

374
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,255
PROBST: All right, guys,
here's the deal.

375
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,965
-Ted, nice work.
-Thanks, Jeff.

376
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,133
-Appreciate it.
-Nice SUV.

377
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,426
-It's all yours, and a day at
the spa. -I'm loving it.

378
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,971
-How much fun is it if you can't
share it, right? -True enough.

379
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,391
But at this point, picking
somebody to share it with is not

380
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,893
-such an easy task with only
five days left. -It isn't.

381
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,520
There was an immunity challenge

382
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,231
and I could have been
out just like that,

383
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,150
but that person kept
me in the game,

384
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,568
and I always told her
that I owed her.

385
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,738
So, Helen,
let's have some fun, baby.

386
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,489
(laughing)

387
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,616
Good job, H.

388
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,453
I left the keys
in the ignition.

389
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,288
Follow down the beach
as far as you can go,

390
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,165
then a right down
the Old Prison Road.

391
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,916
-Got it.
-You'll come to a gazebo

392
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,336
where your day
of relaxation awaits.

393
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,150
-HELEN: Smell it? Ahh...
-TED: Brand-new!

394
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,651
How's it handling, Ted?

395
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,695
-Oh, it's handling
just like a champion. -(shouts)

396
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,489
Your own car.
Your own car.

397
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,532
TED:
<i>I've never won Lotto.</i>

398
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,160
<i>I've never won</i>
<i>any raffle ticket.</i>

399
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,870
<i>And so, for me, winning the car</i>

400
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,455
was truly a dream come true.

401
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,457
We need to talk
just a little bit,

402
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,334
because, um, what I was
trying to get at

403
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,002
is I didn't know
where Janny was.

404
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,504
Well, I know
she doesn't like Clay.

405
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,713
You think?

406
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,341
But she came up to me today
and said, "What does Clay do?

407
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,384
He does nothing, I'm tired
of him ordering me around."

408
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,011
TED:<i> In the car, Helen</i>
<i>and I really had</i>

409
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,680
a chance to talk
and the plan that I proposed

410
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,517
<i>was getting rid of Clay</i>
<i>at the next Tribal Council.</i>

411
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,393
And if he was working,
then that's one thing

412
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,603
I would respect,
but he's not do...

413
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,314
Wh-What do you think, you're
just king for the day, here?

414
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,024
All he does is order
you guys around.

415
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,818
-Yeah, order us around and...
-Then...

416
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,153
I'm going to leave it up to you
to work with Jan.

417
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,155
HELEN: I think I can
take Jan with me.

418
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,824
And somehow, some way,
just relay it to me

419
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,534
-whether we got her or not.
-Okay.

420
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,162
TED:
Oh, my gosh.

421
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,668
Oh!

422
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,378
-Look, we got two hostesses.
-Our hostess with the mostest,

423
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,754
and look
at their nice clean clothes.

424
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,214

Look at this.

440
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,587
Okay, rice.

441
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,922
This is wine.

442
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,715
What are we gonna do?

we don't drink alcohol.

It's good.

452
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,734
I'm having a smorgasbord.

453
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,776
I want to just dive into that.

454
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,613
-Cashew chicken, very good.
-I want to try this.

455

This right here.

Ah!

469
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,353
You made the mistake
of putting rice on your plate.

470
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,188
-TED: Okay, wine.
-Bad idea.

471

-Let's try the wine, let's try
the wine. -Yeah.

Ted, you're disappointing me.

00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,403
Look at the food on your plate.

CLAY:
You know, I'll tell you what,

476
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,240
-that was a heartbreaking
defeat. -BRIAN: Why?

477
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,492
I-I wanted that thing.

-Oh.

I didn't even get a thanks.

489
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,887
He should have thanked me.

490

Anybody that gives you
something for free...

491
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,892
All's I wanted was,
"Hey, thanks. Appreciate it."

492
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,521
What were you saying earlier
about all the whispering?

493

Teddy and, uh, Helen.

00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,026
Hmm.

-I'll work on Janny.

both from Brian and from Clay.

510
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,555
You got to be quiet about that.

511
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,557
-You know what I'm saying?
-Oh, yeah.

512
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,726
-Then we get the ... Clay
out of here. -Right.

513
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,060
With his lazy behind.

514
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,353
Right.

515
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,855
Boy, we need to do that.

516
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,732
So anyway...

517

I love you.

Ted, I love you,

Hey, Helen, is it my turn

Oh, my gosh.

Oh!

Oh! Aah!

When your mind is mush,

that's when you're drunk,
in my opinion.

582

Helen, I don't want
to go to sleep.

583
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,104
I want this night and this day
to last forever.

I'm really trying to suck in
this last piece of it

-That's it.

-Boom, it's over.
-I know.

Are you ready to go to sleep?

00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,893
TED:
You ready?

678
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,978
-Here we go.
-Thanks, Ted.

679
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,980
(Ted imitates gong clanging)

680
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,108
TED:
Have fun.

681
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,279
I'm sure, when he was drunk,
he let some stuff slip.

682
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,281
(sighs) He was making an idiot
out of himself.

683
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,950
-Wow.
-I was like, "Ah,

684
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,993
this could have been
so peaceful."

685
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,787
I mean, it was ridicul...

686
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,330
Then he wanted to stay up
and talk all night.

687
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,456
I was like... (whimpers)

688
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,458
BRIAN:<i> Helen could very well</i>
<i>be playing me,</i>

689
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,627
<i>but at the same time,</i>
<i>she won't.</i>

690
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,462
<i>Helen is somebody</i>
<i>that respects me completely.</i>

691
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,256
<i>I've taken her a long way.</i>

692
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,091
She owes me, and she knows it.

693
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,301
If you see Ted come over to me,
make sure somebody comes over

694
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,637
-so he doesn't have the chance
to start. -Okay.

695
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,848
-Or give a...
the wrong impression. -Okay.

696
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,808
I have a feeling, if Clay
sees me talking to Ted at all...

697
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,309
Right. I've already had to, uh,

698
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,311
say you're going to be fine
and not to worry.

699
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,646
Don't... I mean, I'm locked.

700
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,857
HELEN:<i> I'm definitely playing</i>
<i>two sides of the fence.</i>

701
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,150
<i>Yeah, that's what</i>
<i>you got to do.</i>

702
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,317
And I would bet you,
to a person,

703
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,319
everybody out here is playing
both sides of the fence.

704
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,320
<i>Just hope you don't get caught.</i>

705
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,364
Now, I sat and listened
to everything he said,

706
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,574
and I yeah-yeah-yeahed
him to death.

707
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,784
-Yeah, I know. I know that
you... -Agreed, agreed, agreed.

708
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,454
-Let Ted believe what he
thinks he believes. -Yep.

709
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,957
HELEN:<i> Ted thinks I'm solidly</i>
<i>in his court, and I may be.</i>

710
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,960
Brian and Clay think I'm tight
with them, and I may be.

711
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,504
Uh, quite frankly,
I don't know at this point.

712
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,351
Hey, guys.

713
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,478
First things first.

714
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,731
Big Ted... give it up, buddy.

715
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,609
Hate to, but need to.

716
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,863
Immunity, back up for grabs.

717
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,033
For today's immunity challenge,
you will start at the base

718
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,409
<i>of a ten-step staircase.</i>

719
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,119
<i>The only problem is,</i>

720
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,872
<i>the steps to the staircase</i>
<i>are not finished.</i>

721
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,166
<i>Ten missing pieces</i>
<i>are out in the field.</i>

722
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,544
<i>Each piece is unique</i>
<i>and will only fit in one step.</i>

723
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,380
<i>You gather your missing pieces</i>
<i>one at a time,</i>

724
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,049
<i>and build your steps</i>

725
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,052
<i>one at a time,</i>
<i>from the bottom to the top.</i>

726
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,054
<i>First person to get to the top</i>

727
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,097
with their steps
completed correctly

728
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,059
wins immunity,
guarantees themselves

729
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,727
a one-in-four shot.

730
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,395
-Big enough stakes?
-Yes, sir.

731
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,730
All right. Let's do this thing.

732
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:17,357
-All right.
-Here we go, guys.

733
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,274
This is for immunity

734
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,527
and a guaranteed spot
in the final four.

735
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,778
-Survivors ready?
-ALL: Yeah.

736
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,904
Go!

737
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,421
PROBST: You can grab
one piece at a time.

738
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,924
You can gather them all first
and then start building,

739
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,967
or build as you go.

740
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,843
It's your strategy.

741
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,935
Clay has his first step.

742
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,895
So far, we just have one step.

743
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,192
Clay has one; everybody else
is gathering pieces.

744
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,236
Jan has her first step.

745
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,122
Brian grabs his last piece.

746
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,207
He's going to start
building steps.

747
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,044
Clay has two steps.

748
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,842
Jan has two steps.

749
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,970
Brian has two steps.

750
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,807
Ted and Helen
not yet on the board.

751
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,688
Brian has three steps.

752
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,067
Ted has one step.

753
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,990
Helen has her first step.

754
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,199
Clay's got his third.

755
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,828
Brian has his fourth step.

756
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,331
Jan has her third step.

757
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,000
Clay has his fourth step.

758
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,713
Brian has his fifth step.

759
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,801
Jan with four.

760
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,850
Clay has his fifth step.

761
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,727
Brian has his sixth step.

762
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,899
Clay has his sixth step.

763
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,527
Brian's at seven.

764
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,029
Three to go for Brian.

765
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,406
Clay working on his seventh.

766
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,825
Brian has eight.

767
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,328
Helen has two.

768
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,084
Brian has nine.

769
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,385
Clay still working
on his seventh step.

770
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,595
Brian taking a nice,
leisurely walk

771
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,889
to put his tenth step in.

772
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,060
Walk on up, Brian.

773
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,436
Nice job.

774
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,480
Brian wins immunity!

775
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,274
-Good job, Brian.
-PROBST: Just like that.

776
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,943
-JAN: Good job, Brian.
-Way to go, Brian.

777
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,904
-Oh, thank you, sir.
-You bet.

778
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,155
You are now guaranteed

779
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,824
-a spot in the final four.
-Thank you.

780
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,158
-Nicely done.
-I appreciate that.

781
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,619
Take a moment
to enjoy it up here.

782
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,162
Celebrate your victory.

783
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,320
TED:<i> I think,</i>
<i>at this point in the game,</i>

784
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,448
<i>everyone could be</i>
<i>playing everyone.</i>

785
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,450
<i>So I think it's only natural</i>

786
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,785
<i>for everyone to be</i>
<i>on pins and needles</i>

787
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,621
<i>and really, really observe</i>
<i>everyone in camp,</i>

788
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,706
<i>'cause everyone's wondering</i>

789
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,292
<i>whether or not</i>
<i>they're the next target.</i>

790
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,295
<i>Um, I'm... I'm wondering</i>
<i>if I'm the next target.</i>

791
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,338
<i>Logically,</i>
<i>I would think that I am.</i>

792
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,176
<i>I mean, I won an immunity,</i>
<i>and I won a reward,</i>

793
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:17,513
so I may be perceived to be, um,
physically and mentally strong.

794
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,269
TED:
Be straight with me.

795
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,105
Honestly, I'm asking you
brother to brother.

796
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,440
BRIAN:
Okay.

797
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,817
-Am I the next to go?
-No. Uh-uh.

798
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,943
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

799
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,987
-Why? What are you... what are
you feeling? -Seriously.

800
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,198
I-I was just think...
I was just thinking

801
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,951
that Jan, Clay...
and I wasn't sure whether you...

802
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,661
whether I was going
to be targeted...

803
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,455
I told you,
I'm not sure the deal with--

804
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,665
like I said before--
Clay and H.

805
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,168
Unless something changes,
I'll let you know.

806
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,212
All right, cool.
I just wanted to...

807
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,671
I figured you're the only person

808
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,215
that would give me
a straight-up answer.

809
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,550
I told you, I'm not sure
what's up with them.

810
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,885
I'm not sure about that.

811
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,969
Yeah. Yeah.

812
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,721
So, anyway...

813
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,974
So, targeting... Jan?

814
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,018
-Janny.
-Okay.

815
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,686
JAN:
Those are really pretty, Teddy.

816
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,314
I got one with nature,
and it was just beautiful,

817
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,691
hunting for rocks
and everything.

818
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,152
JAN:
Those are really cool.

819
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,154
How about picking one of these,

820
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,739
with the exception
of this one and that one?

821
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,533
-Yeah. Give me one.
-Here.

822
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,535
Okay, Teddy.

823
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,663
JAN:<i> Helen had come to me</i>
<i>because, if you look at it,</i>

824
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,332
it's... I could be a swing vote.

825
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,876
<i>You know, if Helen and Ted</i>
<i>had an alliance,</i>

826
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,713
<i>they could pull me,</i>
<i>and we could vote Clay out.</i>

827
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,549
<i>I really have to think</i>
<i>about it,</i>

828
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,009
and I would think about it
from the standpoint

829
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,387
of what would be best
for me in the long run.

830
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,432
<i>I'm not sure there's any true,</i>
<i>true alliance right now.</i>

831
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,351
<i>I think people are talking,</i>

832
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,895
<i>but I don't think</i>
<i>the word "alliance"--</i>

833
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,189
<i>that "I will not vote</i>
<i>against you"--</i>

834
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,900
<i>has ever really been said</i>
<i>by any of the five.</i>

835
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,528
<i>You know, Helen and I</i>
<i>are very, very tight,</i>

836
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,322
<i>but trust at this point</i>
<i>in the game--</i>

837
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,867
<i>it's very hard,</i>
<i>and it's a very thin line.</i>

838
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,743
<i>And I might trust you</i>

839
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,620
<i>with everything</i>
<i>in another situation,</i>

840
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,248
<i>but this is a game,</i>
<i>so even if someone</i>

841
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,126
tells you something,
they might not do it.

842
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,420
Hey, we got to be careful
with my pot holder socks

843
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,421
since they actually,
technically,

844
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,423
are still socks that I wear.

845
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,924
Someone's burning them again.

846
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,635
-I got a... I got a new, uh,
burn in them. -JAN: Hmm.

847
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,346
BRIAN:<i> When you know</i>
<i>where everyone's head's at,</i>

848
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,931
<i>it gives you</i>
<i>that much more control,</i>

849
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,100
<i>gives you that much more</i>
<i>confidence,</i>

850
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,852
<i>it gives you</i>
<i>a little bit more, uh...</i>

851
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,770
<i>uh, more useful ammunition.</i>

852
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,981
I've got three pieces
of ammunition I can use.

853
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,901
One, I've got
my trump card, Jan.

854
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,611
Grandma Jan, she's disposable.

855
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,946
Looking good on that black!

856
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,282
-Ooh, yeah. Sharp.
-Stylish!

857
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,035
Oh, boy. Yeah.

858
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,455
Number two, I've got my loyal
and trustworthy soldier, Helen.

859
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,874
<i>I know where her head's at.</i>
<i>I know how she feels about me.</i>

860
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,834
<i>I'm very confident and, uh,</i>

861
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,295
<i>good feeling about her</i>
<i>and her work ethic.</i>

862
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,631
My good friend, Uncle Clay.

863
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,466
<i>I know what he wants;</i>
<i>he knows what I want.</i>

864
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,927
<i>I know he doesn't want Helen.</i>
<i>I know Helen doesn't want him.</i>

865
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,429
<i>When I need to use that</i>
<i>against each other, I will,</i>

866
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,140
<i>but in the meantime,</i>
<i>I'm just sitting back.</i>

867
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,684
<i>So there's my three--</i>
<i>those are my three ins.</i>

868
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,605
One disposable,
a loyal soldier...

869
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,148
Oops. And a good friend.

870
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,358
(chuckling)

871
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,155
CLAY:<i> Uh, really, if you get</i>
<i>to thinking about it,</i>

872
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,782
<i>using people in this game--</i>
<i>isn't everybody</i>

873
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,825
<i>getting used</i>
<i>in one way or the 'nother?</i>

874
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,035
<i>That's the name of this game.</i>

875
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,871
<i>Use everybody you can</i>
<i>on your way to the top.</i>

876
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,039
Here we go again.

877
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,541
The circus has come to town.

878
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,353
We'll now bring in our jury.

879
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:56,148
Erin, Ken, Penny and Jake.

880
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,491
Think about it-- five of you,

881
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,911
five Chuay Gahn members still in
the quest for a million dollars

882
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,205
and the title of sole Survivor.

883
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,832
Directly across from you,

884
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,334
four people,
the four members of our jury,

885
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:19,630
all four Sook Jai members,
all four voted out by you,

886
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,341
and up until tonight,
you were in control.

887
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,094
Chuay Gahn had the numbers,
and systematically, one by one,

888
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,388
you eliminated them
and in doing so,

889
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,557
put your fate in their hands.

890
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,351
That is now the majority
of the jury,

891
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,354
and I wonder how that feels

892
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,565
to be sitting there knowing

893
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,859
it may be too late
to do anything about it.

894
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,360
Clay, how does it feel?

895
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,362
Uh, scary, and, and believe me,

896
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,450
I laid awake at night a lot
and thought about that.

897
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,035
Uh, they've got
to vote for somebody.

898
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,911
I just hope I'm one of the two

899
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,663
that they're,
they're voting for.

900
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,290
That's the only thing
I can hope for, is to try

901
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,875
to figure how to get
to the top the easiest

902
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,085
and, and the best way
for Clay to do it,

903
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,254
and, uh, that's
what I'm searching for.

904
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:02,256
Helen, how do you win this game?

905
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:06,552
Um... they have the numbers,
that's right,

906
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,429
but they also have to vote
for one of the two,

907
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,472
and unfortunately for them,

908
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,474
one of the two is going
to be a Chuay Gahn member.

909
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:15,269
I'm hoping that when it comes
down to voting, um,

910
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,438
that they vote on, uh, merit--

911
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,484
who pulled their weight, who was
a good member to be around.

912
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,445
Brian, you've been out here
36 days now.

913
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,615
In a sense, is your fate sealed
within this tribe?

914
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,867
Uh, no, nobody's fate's
ever sealed

915
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,787
until the, uh, fat lady sings,
as I like to say.

916
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,955
There's, uh, still
a couple days left,

917
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,791
and I can't predict the future.

918
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,417
Uh, who knows
what's going to happen?

919
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,461
PROBST: Jan, you put
this tribe together.

920
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:45,257
Is there an added burden on you
when it comes to voting?

921
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:50,096
Yes, I feel very much so because
I've grown with this tribe.

922
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:54,975
We scraped and fought our way
to keep together, so

923
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,979
it's very hard
to have to vote someone off

924
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,856
that has worked very hard.

925
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,984
There's very little difference
between any of the five of us.

926
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:04,985
It is time to vote.

927
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,404
Jan, you're up.

928
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,132
You're a fierce competitor
and so am I,

929
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,383
<i>which means</i>
<i>if it's down to you or me,</i>

930
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,386
<i>it's going to be you before me.</i>

931
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,479
Nothing but strategy,

932
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,856
<i>and it's time for you to go.</i>

933
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,190
<i>Good-bye.</i>

934
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,496
I'll go tally the votes.

935
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,257
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

936
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,216
The person will be asked

937
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,552
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

938
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,554
I'll read the votes.

939
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,810
First vote-- Ted.

940
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,483
Ted.
That's two votes-- Ted.

941
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,824
Jan.
One vote-- Jan, two votes-- Ted.

942
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,751
Ted.

943
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,629
No need to read the last vote.

944
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,006
You need to bring me your torch.

945
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,218
TED:
Take care, guys.

946
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,724
Ted, the tribe has spoken.

947
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,060
Thanks for everything, man.

948
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,811
I appreciate it.
Take care.

949
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,022
All right, you guys, take care.

950
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,662
Well, you've lasted 36 days.

951
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,288
You have made it
to the final four.

952
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,581
Here's what's left.

953
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,292
Over the next three days, there
will be three Tribal Councils,

954
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,629
two immunity challenges,
one winner.

955
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,216
That winner will be determined
by that jury.

956
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,635
You guys can head back to camp.

957
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,636
Good night.

958
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,816
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

959
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,613
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor...

960
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,615
<i>Only four remain...</i>

961
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,033
CLAY: Y'all, there's
only four torches.

962
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,661
PROBST:<i> ...and it's down to the</i>
<i>last three days on the island.</i>

963
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,037
HELEN:
<i>At this level in the game,</i>

964
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,331
<i>it becomes cutthroat, so</i>
<i>the next couple days I expect</i>

965
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,833
to be extremely stressful.

966
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,127
PROBST:
<i>Join us for a two-hour finale</i>

967
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,338
<i>and find out</i>
<i>who will be the sole Survivor.</i>

968
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:21,348
This has been
a long and wonderful trip.

969
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,517
<i>I was truly blessed</i>
<i>to make it this far.</i>

970
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,687
<i>Sure, I would have loved</i>
<i>to have won, but it's okay.</i>

971
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,857
<i>I sucked it all in</i>
<i>and I have no regrets.</i>

972
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,860
<i>To my baby Morgan, I did this</i>

973
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:37,406
to show you that nothing beats
a failure but a try.
