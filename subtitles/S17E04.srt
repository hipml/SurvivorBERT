<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,799
18 castaways were cut off from

4
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,592
the world by miles of empty

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,469
savannah and endless jungles

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,262
filled with wild creatures.

7
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,889
But the fiercest predator in

8
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,142
Gabon was the yellow tribe...

9
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:20,103
Kota wins immunity and reward!

10
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,980
...who systematically devoured

11
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,523
the weak and struggling red

12
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:24,816
tribe Fang.

13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,984
>> It's tough having to deal

14
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,068
with the losses over and over

15
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:27,652
again.

16
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,987
It starts to make you feel like

17
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,363
you might not ever win.

18
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,490
>> PROBST: We are picking new

19
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,074
tribes.

20
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,200
>> What?!

21
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,035
>> No, no, no.

22
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,287
>> PROBST: On day ten, a tribe

23
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,330
swap gave Fang the opportunity

24
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,874
to improve themselves.

25
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,000
>> I'm going to go with Kelly.

26
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:42,792
>> PROBST: But they continued

27
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,210
to be their own worst enemy by

28
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,920
foolishly picking weak players

29
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,337
over stronger ones.

30
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,466
That may be the most surprising

31
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,384
decision in ten days out here.

32
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,177
At the end of the tribe swap,

33
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,846
Sugar, the pinup model, wasn't

34
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,264
chosen and was sent on her

35
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,098
second trip to Exile Island.

36
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,642
>> I already have the idol, so

37
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,935
I chose comfort.

38
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,103
(chuckles)

39
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,022
>> PROBST: At the immunity

40
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,607
challenge, former Fang member

41
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,232
Randy, the wedding

42
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:06,941
videographer...

43
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,901
>> Whoo!

44
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,902
>> PROBST: Randy scores for

45
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:09,277
Kota!

46
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,112
...made every point in a 3-0

47
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,322
blowout of his old tribe.

48
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,073
Kota wins immunity!

49
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,992
By day 12, Fang had hit an

50
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:16,826
all-time low.

51
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,203
>> It was like we were legless

52
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,663
chickens racing against sleek

53
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,372
weasels.

54
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,207
>> PROBST: And faced with the

55
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,833
choice to vote out a strong

56
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,752
member-- Jacquie-- or a weak

57
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,253
one-- Kelly-- they acted as

58
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,922
though they had a death wish and

59
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,507
weakened their tribe yet again.

60
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,801
Jacquie, the tribe has spoken.

61
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,719
And Ace lost one of his closest

62
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,303
allies.

63
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,305
14 are left.

64
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:51,486
Who will be voted out tonight?

65
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,987
>> The whole tribal thing is a

66
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,240
trip.

67
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,408
>> Uh, sure.

68
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,081
>> Is she here?

69
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:03,957
>> No, but she's coming.

70
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,041
>> Right now?

71
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,378
>> Uh, Tribal didn't pan out the

72
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,170
way I expected.

73
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,090
Jacquie got the boot, and now

74
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:12,674
I'm sort of sitting a little

75
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,384
high and dry.

76
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,015
>> No.

77
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,975
>> I think they were scared

78
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,434
about me having any strength in

79
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,520
my alliance with Jacquie.

80
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,396
Maybe now I will be able to

81
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,439
pull off some sort of coup de

82
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,109
grace once again with, uh,

83
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,151
Sugar.

84
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,737
She's back from Exile Island.

85
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,531
One of Sugar's biggest pluses

86
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,740
is the fact that she has the

87
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,324
immunity idol tucked up her

88
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,369
sleeve, and I've got Sugar in

89
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,162
my pocket.

90
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,038
>> Hey.

91
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:44,330
>> Hi.

92
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,583
Hello.

93
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,625
>> Welcome back.

94
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,501
>> Yeah.

95
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,254
So that means Jacquie's gone.

96
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,630
>> Yep.

97
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,381
>> That sucks.

98
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,633
My very first thought when I

99
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,135
saw that it was the new Fang

100
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,137
tribe was, "Yay, I get to see

101
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,554
Jacquie and Ace."

102
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,016
But instead, I saw Kelly, and

103
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,268
that was a big surprise.

104
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,395
I hate Tribal Council.

105
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,441
Luckily, it was dark, so maybe

106
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,276
I could have hidden some of my

107
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,485
disappointment.

108
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,738
>> Is Exile Island, uh, cool?

109
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,031
>> It was this time.

110
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:18,865
>> It's a cool place?

111
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,449
It was inside the Sugar Shack.

112
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,492
>> It's a cool place?

113
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,243
>> Yeah, it's not bad.

114
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,411
>> So the clue was pretty hard

115
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,080
to find, huh, for the idol?

116
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:26,539
>> Uh, I-I don't know.

117
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,708
I gave up after three clues the

118
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,961
first time, so...

119
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:34,964
>> It's called the Sugar Shack

120
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,256
now.

121
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,300
(chuckles)

122
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,177
>> Sugar, Sugar, Sugar.

123
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,470
She's been out to Exile Island

124
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,180
the longest.

125
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,640
She's had plenty of time to

126
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,307
look for the idol.

127
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,143
And I feel in my heart she has

128
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:47,977
the idol.

129
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,563
So I got to get rid of her.

Bob checked the traps, and he

had a shocking surprise, which

160
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:46,262
was literal.

161
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,346
It was this little fish.

He's about four inches long.

163
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,391
And every time you pick him

164
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,601
up, he sends a little electric

165
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,269
charge through your hand.

181
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,330

It's-it's wonderful.

184
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,541
I can't believe it.

185
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,460
Gill net worked-- unreal.

186
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,546
Fish, beans, corn.

187
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,547
Way, way better than Fang.

188
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,550
So I have no complaints.

189
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,593
Beautiful.

190
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,678
Kota welcomed the three Fang

191
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,847

193
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,976
somebody out right now, they'd

194
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,311
vote the old Fang people out.

195
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,771
But, uh, you know, I'll work on

196
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,271
them.

197
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,190
When they say to adapt, they

198
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,566
mean to adapt, and this crusty

199
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,277
old man can do it.

200
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,363
(elephants trumpeting)

201
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,747
(trumpeting)

202
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,716
(deep growling breaths)

203
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,890
>> (whispers): Hey, hey, hey,

204
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,475
hey, everybody, everybody.

205
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,268
Everybody come here.

206
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:15,852
Everybody come here...

207
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,853
Everybody come here.

208
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,980
Be quiet.

209
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,580
>> It's an elephant, huh?

210
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,665
>> Right there.

211
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:37,957
Right there.

212
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,584
Right at the bottom.

213
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,088
There he is.

214
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:44,505
See him?

215
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,673
(elephant trumpeting)

216
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,800
>> Whoa.

217
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,468
>> That is so cool.

218
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,099
>> Look how big his tusks are.

219
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,642
>> I know.

220
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,978
That's crazy.

221
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,021
They could be, like, right in

222
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,063
our camp, and we wouldn't be

223
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,024
able to see them at nighttime.

224
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:03,858
>> Looks crazy.

225
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,277
(elephant trumpeting)

226
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,153
Oh, here, he's gonna rip

227
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,613
something.

228
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,114
>> Ooh.

229
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,115
>> Yo.

230
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:11,616
>> That's crazy.

231
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,658
Look at him.

232
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,703
He's beautiful.

233
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,330
>> Oh!

234
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,458
>> Whoa!

235
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,044
>> Oh.

236
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,129
(excited chattering)

237
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,549
(oohing)

238
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,010
>> Damn!

239
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,511
(trumpeting)

240
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,639
(gasping)

241
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,681
>> God.

242
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,515
>> Huge!

243
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,600
>> He's lifting, he's lifting up

244
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,853
stuff so he can throw it.

245
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,146
Look at him. Look at him.

246
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,688
Look at him!

247
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:42,897
>> Ah!

248
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,066
>> Come on, shh.

249
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,699
>> No.

250
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,243
>> Let's go.

251
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,244
>> Good luck, guys.

252
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:56,994
>> Good luck and God bless.

253
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:57,745
>> Good luck, don't get killed.

254
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,371
We need you.

255
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,455
>> Have fun.

256
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:00,957
>> This frigging elephant in

257
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,124
the jungle, it's here in our

258
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,335
camp, and it's among us all day

259
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,920
because we hear him all day.

260
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,463
But you can't necessarily see

261
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:08,965
him all the time.

262
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,590
And to actually see one and put

263
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,134
the face to the noise, it's

264
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,053
magnificent.

265
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,271
>> Oh, my God.

266
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,606
The brave boys.

267
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,828
>> Yep.

268
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,540
(leaves rustling)

269
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,625
(branch cracks)

270
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,928
(elephant trumpeting)

271
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,766
>> Oh, he's going that way.

272
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,813
>> Seeing that elephant today

273
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,816
really made me...

274
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,443
step out of the game for a

275
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,902
second.

276
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,654
It just makes you appreciate

277
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,115
the simplicity of life and

278
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,659
the, and the pure things, and...

279
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,745
it makes you appreciate Gabon.

280
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:37,970
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

281
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,472
How's it going, Kota?

282
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:39,764
>> Good.

283
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,350
>> Great.

284
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,309
>> PROBST: Kota, getting your

285
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:43,893
first look at the new Fang

286
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,895
tribe.

287
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,729
Jacquie voted out at the last

288
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,522
Tribal Council.

289
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,065
>> They got rid of Jacquie?

290
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,858
>> Oh!

291
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,151
>> Guys, let's focus on the

292
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:52,651
challenge.

293
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,445
We'll talk about it later.

294
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,948
>> PROBST: A lot of reactions on

295
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:58,616
Kota.

296
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,492
Surprised?

297
00:10:59,575 --> 00:10:59,867
>> Yeah.

298
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,202
>> Definitely, especially given

299
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,078
her effort yesterday.

300
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,497
So pretty shocking.

301
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,706
>> PROBST: Fang is once again a

302
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,332
new tribe.

303
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:06,874
Sugar has joined the Fang

304
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,502
tribe, and the numbers are now

305
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:09,710
even.

306
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,128
All right, you guys ready to

307
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,088
get to today's challenge?

308
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:12,713
>> Yes.

309
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,547
>> Yes, sir.

310
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,090
>> PROBST: All right, for

311
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,716
today's challenge, each tribe

312
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,009
will start with a large pile of

313
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:17,927
fruit.

314
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,595
On my go, you will toss the

315
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,347
fruit to tribe members through

316
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,723
the holes in two walls while

317
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,642
members of the other tribe use

318
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,851
wooden clubs and attempt to

319
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,270
whack that fruit out of the

320
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:28,687
air.

321
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,606
Once a piece of fruit hits the

322
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,232
ground, you can't pick it up.

323
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,067
The fruit will be weighed at

324
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,901
the end, and the tribe that

325
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,903
manages to collect the most

326
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,571
fruit at the end of five

327
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,281
minutes wins reward.

328
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,574
Want to know what you're

329
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:40,950
playing for?

330
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,158
>> Yeah.

331
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,119
>> PROBST: You've been out here

332
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:43,828
13 days.

333
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,413
Your taste buds are screaming

334
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,789
for something new.

335
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,916
Today's reward will satisfy

336
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,626
that craving.

337
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,921
Your own herb garden.

338
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:54,713
>> That's awesome.

339
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,047
>> Awesome.

340
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,632
>> PROBST: That you can keep

341
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,426
living and keep replenishing.

342
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,679
Also got some salt and oil.

343
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,972
In addition, whatever fruit you

344
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,890
catch, yours to keep.

345
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,474
>> That's pretty good, too.

346
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,058
>> PROBST: Worth playing for?

347
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,101
>> Yes!

348
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,144
>> PROBST: All right, give you

349
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
a minute to strategize.

350
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,313
We'll get started.

351
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,276
On defense, wielding the club

352
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,986
for Fang, we have Crystal at

353
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,821
the front net.

354
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,947
Ace at the back net.

355
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,950
For Kota, Bob is at the front

356
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:23,117
net.

357
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,786
Charlie is at the back net.

358
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,455
Here we go.

359
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,748
Survivors ready?

360
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,708
Go!

361
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,586
It's gotta go through the

362
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,254
holes, and you have to catch it.

363
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,630
Danny catches one right away.

364
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,508
He gets denied by Ace.

365
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,551
>> Go, G!

366
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,802
>> Come on!

367
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,262
Oh, my God, GC!

368
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,389
Throw it high! High!

369
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,724
>> Yo, Matty.

370
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,558
>> PROBST: Matty's caught

371
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:47,892
something.

372
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,768
Tries to fake out Charlie!

373
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,270
He does! Kenny has it!

374
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,021
Fang first on the board!

375
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,985
Corinne with the left-handed

376
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,612
toss gets denied.

377
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,448
Dan has another.

378
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,824
Gets it rejected right back to

379
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:03,991
him.

380
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,034
It's a showdown.

381
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:05,910
>> Out of here!

382
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,911
>> PROBST: Kota's gotta figure

383
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,913
out how to get by Ace if they're

384
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,831
gonna score.

385
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,000
Matty has another for Fang.

386
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,793
Another fake on Charlie, and he

387
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,336
gets it through again, and

388
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,296
Kenny catches it again!

389
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,798
Fang with an early lead.

390
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,424
>> Crystal, do not let anything

391
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:20,966
through.

392
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,260
>> PROBST: Dan has two pieces of

393
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,428
fruit.

394
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,263
Ace doing a great job with that

395
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,223
club.

396
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,432
>> This is so fun.

397
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,266
>> PROBST: Different story for

398
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,892
Fang.

399
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,102
Matty is working Charlie.

400
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,729
Another big Matty-to-Kenny

401
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,021
connection.

402
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,232
That combination is giving Fang

403
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,691
a big lead right now.

404
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,234
>> Dan, throw two pieces at

405
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,777
once.

406
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,321
>> PROBST: Dan has two pieces of

407
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:42,988
fruit.

408
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,157
That one connects.

409
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,659
A little banana doesn't weigh

410
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,035
much.

411
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,830
Dan connects with Randy.

412
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,873
>> Atta boy, Dan, perfect.

413
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,333
>> PROBST: Kota starting to get

414
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,378
the hang of it now.

415
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,170
>> Yes!

416
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,672
>> PROBST: Fang continues to

417
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,256
make connections with those

418
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,968
smaller pieces of fruit.

419
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:04,927
Dan has half a watermelon and a

420
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,095
pineapple.

421
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,431
Catches the half a watermelon.

422
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,724
That's a lot of weight.

423
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,142
Matty to Kenny continues to

424
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,143
work.

425
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,063
Two minutes left.

426
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,024
Big reception by Randy!

427
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,361
Kota making a good comeback.

428
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,571
>> Got it!

429
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,697
>> PROBST: Huge pineapple caught

430
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,197
by Kenny.

431
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,865
>> Wait for Dan! Wait for Dan!

432
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,908
>> PROBST: Waiting on that left

433
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,951
hand. There it is.

434
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,786
Both baskets look pretty full.

435
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,329
45 seconds left.

436
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,707
We are neck-and-neck.

437
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,333
Dan has a watermelon and a

438
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,876
pineapple.

439
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,712
Annihilates Ace.

440
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,213
The good news is, Ace, nothing

441
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:41,797
got through.

442
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,090
>> Yeah.

443
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,301
>> PROBST: We're in the final

444
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,302
seconds of this challenge.

445
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,636
It is very close.

446
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,178
You need to make those last

447
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,308
pieces of fruit count.

448
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,311
Ten seconds left!

449
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,607
Five, four, three,

450
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,941
two, one.

451
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,527
That's it!

452
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,237
Challenge is over!

453
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:05,654
>> Good job, guys.

454
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,406
>> Like that where you guys had

455
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,532
going two at a time.

456
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,199
That was awesome.

457
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,492
>> PROBST: Good effort.

458
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,702
Very close.

459
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,995
We'll start with Fang.

460
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,750
We're gonna weigh to see who

461
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,419
has the most weight.

462
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,926
16 pounds for Fang.

463
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,053
>> Not bad.

464
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,471
>> PROBST: Kota, you gotta have

465
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,307
16 pounds and an ounce.

466
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,981
You're at ten.

467
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,656
Kota just under 15 pounds.

468
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,073
>> Come on! Come on.

469
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,785
>> Yeah!

470
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,370
>> PROBST: This is what you have

471
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,080
left.

472
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,543
By two pounds, Kota wins reward.

473
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,337
(all cheering)

474
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,303
All right, Kota, now you have

475
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,055
another big decision to make.

476
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,640
Which member of Fang are you

477
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,141
sending to Exile Island?

478
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,559
>> She might as well have the

479
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,435
mail forwarded there 'cause

480
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,020
Sugar's going again.

481
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,230
(Sugar laughs)

482
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,314
>> That's all right.

483
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,482
I've already named it the

484
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,110
"Sugar Shack."

485
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,403
>> PROBST: Dan, why sending

486
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
Sugar again?

487
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,905
>> Just strategy. Purely comedy.

488
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,115
>> Wow.

489
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:31,490
(Sugar laughing)

490
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,075
>> No, no, because we think if

491
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,743
she finds the idol, she'd had to

492
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,327
play it before the merge, and

493
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,496
we'd like it to get back into

494
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:37,788
circulation.

495
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,039
>> Whatever.

496
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,666
>> PROBST: I know you don't need

497
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,041
the map.

498
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,167
You could probably show me

499
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,043
where it is better.

500
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:43,711
>> Bye.

501
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,336
>> PROBST: Sugar will return in

502
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,463
time for the next immunity

503
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,214
challenge.

504
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,925
Fang, got nothing for you.

505
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:50,592
Grab your stuff.

506
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,177
Head back to camp.

507
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,137
Kota, congratulations.

508
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,138
Come get your reward.

509
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,139
>> Thank you.

510
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,849
>> Yes, thank you.

511
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:11,155
♪ ♪

512
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,656
>> Wow, guys, the plants are

513
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,741
okay.

514
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,783
They're getting water for that.

515
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,325
>> We just got back from our

516
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,161
reward challenge with all of

517
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,287
our new fruits and vegetables,

518
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,664
and so spirits are high around

519
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,290
here, but I feel bad for those

520
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,459
Fang members because I know all

521
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,793
they're eating is rice with no

522
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,335
flavor, and we have tons and

523
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,128
tons of food here.

524
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,130
>> Life is good.

525
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,257
>> The rich are definitely

526
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,135
getting richer here at Kota.

527
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,261
>> All right, so, instead of

528
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,847
the Axis of Evil, we now have

529
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,766
the Evil Empire, guys.

530
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,768
And I think we need to keep our

531
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,102
numbers and stick together once

532
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:42,478
the merge comes.

533
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,646
I'm gonna need all seven of

534
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,105
you guys.

535
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,356
We're gonna have-- our first

536
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,816
couple of votes after the merge

537
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,484
are gonna have to be unanimous.

538
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,277
I'm an outspoken person and,

539
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,656
and I tend to want to, um, get

540
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,658
people's adrenaline going.

541
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,326
It's a game where you light

542
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,411
a fire under people going up

543
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,704
against, you know, someone you

544
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,414
can coin the "Evil Empire"

545
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,457
absolutely gives us more

546
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,875
motivation to go in there and

547
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,168
win, and not just win by a

548
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,377
little, win by a lot.

549
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,338
And once we get one or two out,

550
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,298
they're gonna crumble, and our

551
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,257
seven will go further.

552
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:12,841
>> The next immunity challenge

553
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,426
is the most important of the

554
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,427
game.

555
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,136
I think everyone's on the same

556
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,137
page about that.

557
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,389
I think the biggest issue with

558
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,851
Dan is he is so eager to

559
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,523
express his undying, complete,

560
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,901
and total devotion to the new

561
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,694
Kota tribe that no one believes

562
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,738
him.

563
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,532
>> Us seven, as long as we win

564
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,282
the immunity challenges, and us

565
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,535
seven stick together, we're

566
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,702
always gonna have the

567
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,245
numbers on them.

568
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,329
>> On the flip side, Susie's

569
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,205
the opposite of Dan.

570
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,540
She's so quiet that it makes

571
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,875
you think that she's not quite

572
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,168
as on board about stuff that

573
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,046
we've been talking about.

574
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,339
We're now focused on the next 48

575

of this game right now.

580
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,138

581
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,391

Once again, Kota won, and did I

588
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,704
kick ass or what?

589
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,956
My plan right now is just

590
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,207
continue to win challenges and

591
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,208

592
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:33,672

594
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,310

pure comedy sake, which is

596
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,396
hilarious 'cause I was

597
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:54,693

598
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,277
Better than last time.

599
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,196
Everybody else in the game is

600
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,909
tired and starving and stinky

601
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,702
and dirty as all get-out, and I

602
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,412
am living high on the hog in

603
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,415
Eden all by myself with my own

604
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,751
lake and fruit and comfort, and

605
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm a very happy camper now.

606
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,714
I have the idol, and I'd have

607
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,134
to be really dumb to get sent

608
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:19,718
home next.

609
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,469
But I definitely am happy and

610
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,889

614

>> Yeah.

615
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,447
There's about 13 grains of rice.

616
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,533
We can all have two grains.

617
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,785

I'll tell you that much.

626
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,478
I've been out here just a

627
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,854
couple of weeks, and it's way

628
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,272
more difficult than I ever

629
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,066
would have expected.

630
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,693
Not only do you gotta win these

631
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,695

632
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,404

00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,739
deal with these people day in

634
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,491

mean?

639

00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,538
>> I want to get back on my

956
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,249
grind and focus on, you know,

957
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,126
what's gonna make me happy, man.

958
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,047
Seriously, man.

959
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,089
>> It's all good.

960
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,716
Just trust me.

961
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,342
>> You ask to leave this game,

962
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,802
man, and it's, people pounce on

963
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,888
that.

964
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,153
>> That's bull.

965
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,655
I don't want to hear that.

966
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,740
I don't want to hear it.

967
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:34,494
Does he think we're going to

968
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,037
be like, "Oh, please stay.

969
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,497
Please stay"?

970
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,666
If you wanna (no audio) go, go.

971
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,918
>> I know.

972
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,086
>> I'm not kissing ass for,

973
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,587
"Oh, please stay."

974
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,506
>> What do we do now?

975
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,548
>> If that's what he wants,

976
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,132
that's what he wants.

977
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,260
I'm voting for GC, hands down.

978
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,845
When we elected him leader, he

979
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,179
quit at that.

980
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,056
He's quit at the challenges and

981
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,057
now he wants to quit the game.

982
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,266
To me, he's a loser.

983
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,476
I have no respect for people

984
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,811
like that that's just gonna

985
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,021
quit.

986
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,022
Being out here that long,

987
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:03,856
starving, is a mind game

988
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,191
in itself.

989
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,196
So, that's where I stand.

990
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,958
>> Whatever.

991
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,835
He's going home tonight.

992
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,003
>> Good.

993
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,174
>> We're voting out GC.

994
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,009
>> I trust you.

995
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:32,802
You're paying attention.

996
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,720
>> Well, you know, we're gonna

997
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,220
be (indistinct) to merge

998
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,974
in a tribe that we were dead.

999
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,642
Letting them destroy themselves

1000
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,352
is very pleasurable to watch.

1001
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,478
Not this time, but at a certain

1002
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,313
point, I might call upon you

1003
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,815
to use the idol.

1004
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,816
>> You haven't told anybody,

1005
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,650
have you?

1006
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,568
>> No, nobody knows.

1007
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,152
>> Okay, good, sweet.

1008
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,363
>> Have you hid the idol?

1009
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,364
>> Yeah, it's in my bag, but

1010
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,699
nobody thinks I have it.

1011
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,784
Nobody's going in there.

1012
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,226
>> I'm looking. I'm looking.

1013
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,318
>> Let me see.

1014
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,279
It can't be that small.

1015
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,822
>> You're not looking!

1016
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,656
Keep a lookout.

1017
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,909
Otherwise we'll get in trouble.

1018
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,370
>> I knew she had it.

1019
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,246
I knew she had it the first...

1020
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,081
>> That's why she's so

1021
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:44,999
confident.

1022
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,085
>> Right.

1023
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,214
>> Tonight is the only night to

1024
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,175
blindside her.

1025
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,677
That's the freaking... she is

1026
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,303
the most dangerous person right

1027
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,765
now in this game.

1028
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,600
>> So, now we all know that

1029
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,184
Sugar has the hidden immunity

1030
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,020
idol, and it really changes

1031
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,147
things because nobody really

1032
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,899
wants to keep GC here longer,

1033
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,527
but right now everybody's

1034
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,028
scared of that idol.

1035
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:14,821
>> Dude, I don't have time for

1036
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,404
quitters but the idol, that's

1037
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,491
like, more intense.

1038
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:42,682
(tribal singing)

1039
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,599
>> PROBST: Let's talk about the

1040
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,893
wear and tear so far.

1041
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,520
Ace, are you starting to notice

1042
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,229
the impact of being out here

1043
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,898
for 15 days now?

1044
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,941
>> Uh, a little bit.

1045
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,192
I can see it when, you know,

1046
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,610
people are running out of belt

1047
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,904
loops and, you know, things

1048
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,406
that were tight before are

1049
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,283
suddenly falling off.

1050
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,784
So, yeah, you can notice it,

1051
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,785
really.

1052
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,828
>> PROBST: GC, the belt loop's

1053
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,412
got to be referring to you.

1054
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,414
>> Yeah, it's definitely hard,

1055
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,000
um, not eating, you know, the

1056
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:09,959
the type of foods that you're

1057
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:10,877
used to eating.

1058
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,460
It definitely takes a toll on

1059
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,629
you physically and mentally.

1060
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,006
But more than the material

1061
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,549
things, you start to think

1062
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,258
what's more important to you.

1063
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,261
Is it staying out here and

1064
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,596
starving and dealing with

1065
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,221
personalities and losing

1066
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,515
challenges, and it's

1067
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,017
definitely hard when you just

1068
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,894
think about, you know, how much

1069
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,477
you could just love to be with

1070
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,396
your family and your friends,

1071
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,522
you know, and, and how often

1072
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,483
you take it for granted.

1073
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,526
>> PROBST: Sugar, have you heard

1074
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,862
GC talking about home?

1075
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,529
>> I've only spent this

1076
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,780
afternoon with everybody,

1077
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,908
so, I really, uh, I know that

1078
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,618
he's feeling like he wants to go

1079
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,410
soon and, uh...

1080
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,328
>> PROBST: Like he wants to go

1081
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,913
soon?

1082
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:47,705
Like go home?

1083
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,707
>> Yeah.

1084
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,791
>> PROBST: So, GC, you've talked

1085
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,335
about going home.

1086
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,128
>> I, you know, I haven't had

1087
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,088
the easiest life, man.

1088
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,257
And I've suffered all growing up

1089
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,258
and just being out here, it's

1090
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,345
like, I'm kind of done

1091
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,471
suffering.

1092
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:03,930
You know what I mean?

1093
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,389
I realize what's important to

1094
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,474
me.

1095
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,350
But I definitely feel like,

1096
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:11,312
you know, it's... it's hard.

1097
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,230
>> PROBST: And right on cue,

1098
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,857
Sugar, you're crying.

1099
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,608
>> Well, I think we all feel

1100
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,359
this way.

1101
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,985
I mean, we all miss home and

1102
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,445
everything and we are all being

1103
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,989
nasty sometimes.

1104
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,491
Like, it's weird turning on

1105
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,283
people, and I don't think any

1106
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,036
of us like that too much.

1107
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,498
So, it's probably hardest on our

1108
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,209
psyche than physically.

1109
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,919
>> PROBST: Matty, tough to hear

1110
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,879
a tribe mate talk about wanting

1111
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,005
to go home?

1112
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:38,881
'Cause it's gonna affect all

1113
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,507
of you in one way or another

1114
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,592
if you're out here long enough.

1115
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,009
>> You know what?

1116
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,427
There's just...

1117
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,346
There's no quitting.

1118
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:45,930
You can't give yourself that

1119
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:46,430
option.

1120
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,390
Even though you're hurting

1121
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,809
right now, that's the answer.

1122
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,018
You cannot give yourself that

1123
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,063
option.

1124
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:54,939
>> PROBST: Sugar, let's talk

1125
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,440
about your experience out here.

1126
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,109
You've spent more time on Exile

1127
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,110
than you have at the Kota or

1128
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,361
the Fang camp.

1129
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,779
How concerned are you that I'm

1130
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,531
clearly somebody that might be

1131
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,324
going home because I don't even

1132
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:05,658
know anybody?

1133
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,368
>> Right.

1134
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,911
I kind of feel like it could be

1135
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,787
me.

1136
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,247
I am the one that knows the

1137
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:11,831
least about these people and

1138
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,540
they know the least about me.

1139
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,543
So, it could just as easily be

1140
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,627
me tonight, so, I brought my

1141
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,712
bag.

1142
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,504
>> PROBST: Kenny, is it a little

1143
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,839
frustrating that Sugar keeps

1144
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,215
getting sent to Exile?

1145
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,299
There's something extremely

1146
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,968
valuable out there.

1147
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,095
>> Um, yeah, I'm sure it comes

1148
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,638
to everybody's mind that, you

1149
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,347
know, maybe she found it, but

1150
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,808
nobody knows unless she's told

1151
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,600
people.

1152
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,103
But it is very frustrating.

1153
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,021
>> PROBST: So, what kind of

1154
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:35,604
strategy, Sugar, goes through

1155
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,397
your mind, whether you have the

1156
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,398
idol or not?

1157
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,108
Do I let them know I have the

1158
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:39,859
idol?

1159
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,651
Do I convince them I don't

1160
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,569
have the idol?

1161
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,987
>> Nobody really asked me if I

1162
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,697
had the idol, actually.

1163
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,698
>> PROBST: Does that strike you

1164
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,991
as odd?

1165
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,159
>> No, not considering

1166
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:48,951
that you're allowed to go

1167
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,536
through people's bags.

1168
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,454
So, no, it doesn't surprise me.

1169
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,080
>> PROBST: So, you think your

1170
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,040
bag has been gone through or you

1171
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,373
don't know?

1172
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,751
>> I don't know.

1173
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,752
>> PROBST: Do you keep your bag

1174
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,669
with you?

1175
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,795
>> Nope.

1176
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,088
I keep it out where anybody can

1177
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,715
go through it if they want.

1178
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,175
>> PROBST: Crystal, crazy to

1179
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,384
leave your bag out or crazy

1180
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,428
smart?

1181
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,972
>> Crazy to leave your bag out.

1182
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,349
>> PROBST: Sugar, do you really

1183
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,392
truly not care if people know

1184
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,852
you have the idol?

1185
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,604
>> Maybe there's a sense of

1186
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,938
power in knowing that, you

1187
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,690
know, somebody has the idol

1188
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,984
and maybe you don't want to

1189
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,319
vote against them because they

1190
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:27,573
might use it to vote you out.

1191
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,574
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1192
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,408
to vote.

1193
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,494
Sugar, you're up.

1194
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,962
>> I'm only voting for you

1195
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,422
because you want to go home

1196
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,423
and I'm really sorry because

1197
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:44,965
I think you're a really cool

1198
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,509
person.

1199
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,061
>> My vote is for Kelly

1200
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,896
because I had to vote for

1201
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,981
somebody.

1202
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,001
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1203
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,753
votes.

1204
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,017
If anybody has the hidden

1205
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,102
immunity idol and you want to

1206
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,812
play it, now would be the time

1207
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,897
to do so.

1208
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,487
Okay, once the votes are read,

1209
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,738
the decision is final.

1210
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,322
The person voted out will be

1211
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,407
asked to leave the Tribal

1212
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,992
Council area immediately.

1213
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:57,204
I'll read the votes.

1214
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:02,793
First vote: GC.

1215
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:03,919
GC.

1216
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,089
Two votes GC.

1217
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,883
Kelly.

1218
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,970
Two votes GC; one vote Kelly.

1219
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:13,554
GC.

1220
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:18,225
Three votes GC.

1221
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,101
Fifth person voted out of

1222
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,978
<i>Survivor: Gabon:</i> GC.

1223
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,104
That's four; that's enough.

1224
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,231
You need to bring me your torch.

1225
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,282
GC, your tribe has spoken.

1226
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:46,754
You guys have endured

1227
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,673
a lot in your first 15 days.

1228
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,342
One thing is for certain: you

1229
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,636
are going to have to dig deep

1230
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,553
if you're going to last in this

1231
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,513
game.

1232
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,473
Grab your torches and head back

1233
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,140
to camp.

1234
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,267
Good night.

>> I just don't know who would

1246
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,704
be my potential Benedict Arnold.

1247
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,207
Until merge, on your girl,

1248
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,291
you're not gonna stab me

1249
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,042
in the back.

1250
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:25,584
>> I made a pact with Ace.

1251
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,002
>> Deal.

1252
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:31,006
>> Deal.

1253
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,757
>> This is going to be the

1254
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,759
start of a great run for me.

1255
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:38,097
I have complete supremacy.

1256
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,643
>> For all the people who, who

1257
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,936
might say that I quit or I

1258
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,062
just gave up, call it what you

1259
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:45,729
want.

1260
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,272
The back-stabbing and the

1261
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:46,855
lying, that's the part that I

1262
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,816
really didn't agree with.

1263
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:49,650
I never expected it to be this

1264
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:49,817
hard.

1265
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,235
The vote for Kelly was the

1266
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,152
throwaway vote.

1267
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,487
She was the one who I connected

1268
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:53,821
with the least.

1269
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,906
I got the utmost respect for

1270
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,866
anybody who makes it, who even

1271
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,451
tries out, and whoever has

1272
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,620
walked in my shoes.
