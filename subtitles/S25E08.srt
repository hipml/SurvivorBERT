THE TRIBES ARE MERGING!

>> Jeff: AFTER THE TWO TRIBES

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,846
MERGED, TANDANG HAD A 7-4

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,013
ADVANTAGE OVER KALABAW.

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,682
>> MERGING WITH NUMBERS, EVEN

8
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:15,932

>> ME YOU AND DENICE KNOWS.

15
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,276
NOBODY ELSE KNOWS.

>> Jeff: WITH THE TRIBES

17
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,071
MERGED, PENNER WENT TO WORK

18
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,281
CONVINCING R.C. AND SKEW PHONE

19
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,115
TURN ON THEIR OLD TRIBE.

20
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,118
>> YOU HAVE TO HELP HIM FEEL AS

21
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:35,702
COMFORTABLE AS HE CAN ABOUT

22
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,120
SLITTING THE THROATS OF THE

23
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,997
PEOPLE HE SPENT 17 DAYS WITH.

24
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,623
>> Jeff: UNFORTUNATELY FOR

25
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,666
PENNER, JEFF WANTED TO TAKE OUT

26
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,128
THE RETURNING PLAYER.

27
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,465
>> I'LL JOIN ANY GANG AS LONG AS

28
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,133
I CAN GET PENNER OUT BEFORE I

29
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:50,717
GET OUT.

30
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,301
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

31
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,094
PENNER WASN'T SURE OF HIS

32
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,264
ALLIANCE AND DECIDED TO PLAY HIS

33
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:56,473
IDOL.

34
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,974
IF ANYBODY HAS AN IDOL AND YOU

35
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:58,892
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE

36
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,267
THE TIME.

37
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,478
>> I'LL DO IT.

38
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,228
>> Jeff: HIS INSTINCTS WERE

39
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:02,479
CORRECT.

40
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,231
HIS ALLIANCE TURNED.

41
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,441
EIGHT PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

42
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,526
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY, R.C.

43
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,404
>> AND HIS ALLY R.C. WAS

BLINDSIDED.

45
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,782
R.C., THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

46
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,449
TEN ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED

47
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:20,663
OUT TONIGHT.

48
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,373
>> SO WHAT ALL HAPPENED TODAY?

49
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,334
WHAT WAS THE DECISION?

50
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,085
>> WE WERE EXPECTING BIG NUMBERS

51
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,420
TO COME OUR WAY, WE EXPECTED

52
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,296
EIGHT AT ONE TIME AND GETTING TO

53
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,256
TALKING TO PEOPLE AND NUMBERS

54
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,508
WEREN'T THERE.

55
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,133
EVERYBODY WAS WISHY-WASHY.

56
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,677
EVERYBODY WAS TOO WISHY-WASHY.

57
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,179
>> I KNOW, BUT THE THE THREE OF

58
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,389
YOU GUYS VOTED WITH US AS

59
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,266
DISCUSSED FOR PETE I WOULD HAVE

60
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,726
USED THE IDOL AND PETE WOULD

61
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,019
HAVE GONE HOME AND WE WOULD HAVE

62
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,020
HAD THE NUMBERS.

63
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,313
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU

64
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,148
GUYS WERE THINKING.

65
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,192
>> DOES IT HURT TO GET BETRAYD?

66
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,320
YEAH, OF COURSE IT DOES.

67
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:52,487
WHY?

68
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,238
BECAUSE YOU WERE KEPT OUT OF THE

69
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:53,530
SECRET.

70
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,824
THERE WERE SECRETS BEING TALKED

71
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,449
ABOUT BEHIND YOUR BACK.

72
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,952
AND THE THING THAT YOU TRUSTED

73
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,161
WASN'T TRUE.

74
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,205
DID YOU VOTE FOR R.C.?

75
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,248
>> I DO NOT VOTE FOR R.C.

76
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,332
>> YOU VOTED FOR ME.

77
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,460
>> YEAH.

78
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,253
I'M GOING TO BE HONEST.

79
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,588
>> I APPRECIATE THE HONESTY.

80
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:10,755
WHY?

81
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,174
>> I HAVE MY OWN STRATEGY AND MY

82
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,718
OWN KIND OF PATH AND IT MAY BLOW

83
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,303
UP IN MY FACE AND IT MAY

84
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:17,929
BACKFIRE ON ME.

85
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,514
>> WELL, I MEAN, LISTEN YOU SAID

86
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,849
TO ME YOU WANTED TO WORK WITH

87
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,183
ME, WHATEVER, IT'S OKAY.

88
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,017
THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.

89
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,687
>> AND CARTER AND I, WE TRIED TO

90
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,896
DRAW THE LINE THE BEST WE CAN SO

91
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,189
WE CAN SAVE OUR OWN ASS AND

92
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,400
EVERYBODY SAVES THEIR OWN ASS.

93
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,026
WHEN THE BIGGER PICTURE DOESN'T

94
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,194
COME TOGETHER, WHAT DO YOU DO?

95
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,238
GO DOWN WITH THE SINKING SHIP?

96
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:35,655
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

97
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,823
>> RIGHT.

98
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,240
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

99
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,366
>> YOU KNOW, NOW THAT PENNER'S

100
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,577
PLAYED HIS IDOL, HE DOESN'T HAVE

101
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,202
ANY MORE POWER THAT WAY SO WE'RE

102
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,289
GOING TO DO OUR BEST TO WIN THE

103
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,832
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY, OR AT LEAST

104
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,416
NOT ALLOW PENNER TO HAVE IT,

105
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,293
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE HIM OUT.

106
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,295
IN THE MEANTIME, I GAVE UP A LOT

107
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,131
OF POWER AND AUTHORITY WHEN I

108
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,924
VOTED WITH TANDANG TONIGHT.

109
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,509
BUT THAT'S HOW I'M GOING TO WORK

110
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,427
MYSELF TO THE TOP IS I'M GOING

111
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,972
TO USE TANDANG AGAINST

112
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,473
THEMSELVES, USE EVERY RESOURCE

113
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,766
THAT I CAN AND SEE WHERE IT GOES

114
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,644
FROM THERE.

115
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,438
SO I CAN IMAGINE HOW YOU'RE

116
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:08,646
FEELING.

117
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,439
BUT WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS

118
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,774
DON'T -- I KNOW YOU'D NEVER

119
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,067
THROW THE TOWEL IN, BUT DON'T

120
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,737
THROW IT IN.

121
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,322
THERE'S CRACKS, I'M TELLING YOU.

122
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,656
THERE IS CRACKS.

123
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,450
THERE'S CRACKS AND I DON'T KNOW

124
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,285
IF PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME THE

125
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,330
TRUTH, BUT I AM NOT GOING HOME

126
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,998
AFTER YOU.

127
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,584
I AM NOT GOING HOME AFTER YOU.

128
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,544
>> SO WHO SHOULD WE WORK WITH?

129
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,130
>> I ALMOST THINK WE SHOULD JUST

130
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,758
WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO SCREW UP

131
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,178
AND WAIT FOR A CRACK TO GET

132
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:40,428
EXPOSED.

133
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,095
BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE.

134
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,639
>> ALL RIGHT.

135
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,264
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

136
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,059
>> ALL RIGHT, MY MAN?

137
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,477
>> I'M NOT RESIGNED TO GOING

138
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:47,977
HOME.

139
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,854
THERE'S NO QUIT IN ME.

140
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,481
BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN GET

141
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,107
FURTHER NOW IS BY TAKING MY FOOT

142
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,567
WAY OFF THE GAS PEDAL, CLIMB

143
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,027
INTO THE BACKSEAT, PULL THE

144
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,112
BLANKET OVER MY HEAD AND HOPE

145
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,572
THEY FORGET I'M HERE FOR A

146
00:03:59,656 --> 00:03:59,822
WHILE.

147
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,324
BUT THEY NOW HAVE BETRAYED ME SO

148
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,326
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

149
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,579
I HAVE NO ALLIANCES, I HAVE NO

150
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,956
ALLEGIANCES, I DON'T CARE.

151
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,373
EVERYBODY'S EQUAL.

152
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,500
THEY ARE ALL READY TO DIE.

LET'S SEE IF I CAN CATCH SOME.

158

>> SOUNDS COOL.

159
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,436
>> EVERYBODY IS SO GALVANIZED

160
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,980
AGAINST PENNER BECAUSE THEY

161
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,064
REALLY DON'T WANT RETURNING

162
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,275
PLAYERS HAVING A SECOND CHANCE.

163
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,110
AND THEY FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT

164
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,946
THEY WANT PENNER AND SKUPIN GONE

165
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,905
FIRST AND SECOND.

166
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,992
FOR MY GAME, I WANT TO STAY WITH

167
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,161
TANDANG, BUT I HAVE NO QUALMS

168
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,287
ABOUT MAKING THIS BATTLE TO WIN

169
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,080
A MILLION DOLLARS A LITTLE BIT

170
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,999
EASIER IF IT'S WITHIN MY POWER.

171
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,292
WELL, WHAT'D YOU FIND?

172
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,418
>> I DIDN'T CATCH ANYTHING.

173
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,378
>> ONCE PENNER AND SKUPIN'S

178
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,264
AND ABI.

CAN.

183
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:53,770
>> RIGHT.

184

00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,026
FEEL LIKE I'M HOME FOR A LITTLE

419
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:57,193
BIT.

GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

424
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:03,657
CAMP.

425
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,867
JEFF, DENICE, MALCOLM, PENNER,

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,952
LISA, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT,

427
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:36,148
GOOD AFTERNOON.

428
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:36,774
>> IT'S GOOD IT HAPPENED THAT

429
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:36,941
WAY.

430
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:37,942
EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

431
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:42,655
>> I'M NOT IN THE GAME.

432
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,365
OH, MAN, I WANTED THAT REWARD.

433
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,866
BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, I'M OUT

434
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,535
HERE FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.

435
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,035
I'M STILL IN THE GAME.

436
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,746
I'VE BEEN EATING BEANS AND RICE

437
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,748
FOR 21 DAYS, BEANS AND RICE FOR

438
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:57,962
19 MORE DAYS, NOT A PROBLEM FOR

439
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,796
ME.

440
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,839
>> YOU GUYS GOT A FOUR WITH

441
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,090
LISA?

442
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,093
>> IT'S ABI, ARTIS, PETER AND

443
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,469
LISA, FOUR.

444
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,095
AND YOU ARE YOU AND JEFF.

445
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,056
I GUESS YOU GUYS ARE PART OF THE

446
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,141
ALLIANCE, TOO.

447
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:15,062
YOU KNOW, GOING WITH PENNER.

448
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,441
AND THERE IS NO, LIKE,

449
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,109
PLACEMENT, REALLY.

450
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,068
I REALLY DO THINK THAT WAY.

451
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,237
>> YOU GUYS ARE UP THERE,

452
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,487
THOUGH.

453
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,656
THAT JUST MAKES SENSE.

454
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,074
ABI'S GOT A BIG MOUTH AND WHEN

455
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:27,908
ABI NEED INFORMATION, THAT'S

456
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,994
VERY DANGEROUS.

457
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,245
SO IT'S LIKE THE PUPPY YOU HAVE

458
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,538
TO TAKE CARE OF.

459
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,832
SO THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING.

460
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,333
WE HAVE TANDANG NOW.

461
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:36,959
EVERYTHING'S JUST A FREE RIDE TO

462
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:37,209
HOME.

463
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,086
SO I'M THINKING WE HAVE TO GET

464
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,672
RID OF KALABAW.

465
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,674
SO WE -- THEY WANT TO GET RID OF

466
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,717
PENNER NOW, RIGHT?

467
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,260
AND THEN THEY WANT TO GET RID OF

468
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,720
SKUPIN NEXT.

469
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,847
BUT WHAT IF WE GET RID OF

470
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,432
PENNER, KEEP SKUPIN AROUND FOR A

471
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,976
WHILE, TAKE OUT JEFF, TAKE OUT

472
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,935
DENICE, THEN TAKE OUT MALCOLM

473
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,855
AND THEN VOTE OUT SKUPIN.

474
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,522
>> OKAY.

475
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,481
I WANT JEFF GONE.

476
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,191
I THINK HE'S FORMING AN ALLIANCE

477
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:01,859
WITH LISA.

478
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,110
EVEN THOUGH YOU THINK I'M

479
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,111
(BLEEP) AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE

480
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:04,320
ME.

481
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,572
>> WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO

482
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:06,947
THAT?

483
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,365
ACTUALLY, STUFF PISSES YOU OFF,

484
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,533
THAT PISSES ME OFF.

485
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,034
STOP THAT.

486
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,452
ABI'S IMMATURE.

487
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,661
SHE THINKS EVERYBODY'S OUT TO

488
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,371
GET HER AND I WISH I COULD VOTE

489
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,457
HER OUT BUT I KNOW IF SHE'S IN

490
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,041
THE FINAL THREE SHE'S NOT

491
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:21,337
GETTING ANY VOTE.

492
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,047
>> SHOULD WE GET A LITTLE DRINK

493
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,631
AND A TOAST?

494
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,424
>> YES.

495
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,426
>> LET'S DO A TOAST.

496
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,720
HERE'S TO AN INCREDIBLE PULLOFF.

497
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,262
AWESOME TEAM WORK.

498
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,389
>> GREAT ALL THE WAY AROUND.

499
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,307
>> HEY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

500
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,433
>> LICK IT OFF!

501
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,977
>> OH, YOU GUYS.

502
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,854
ON THE REWARD, IT WAS A GREAT

503
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,063
GROUP.

504
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,564
WE GOT TO GO DOWN THE RIVER AND

505
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,231
JUST EAT.

506
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,067
>> JUST A FEW RIBS, GUYS.

507
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,151
>> I DON'T KNOW THE IF THERE'S

508
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:44,401
ENOUGH.

509
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,029
>> I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

510
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,197
>> LET'S JUST SAVOR BITE AFTER

511
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,531
BITE.

512
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,616
THAT'S WHO I WOULD HAVE WANTED

513
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,742
TO HAVE BEEN AT THAT REWARD WITH

514
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,243
BECAUSE THEY'RE A POSITIVE GROUP

515
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,411
THAT HAS MESHED TOGETHER WELL.

516
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,913
IT WAS NICE TO BE WITH THEM.

517
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,665
I FEEL HORRIBLE FOR THOSE GUYS

518
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,084
BACK AT CAMP BUT I'M SO THANKFUL

519
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:00,376
FOR THIS.

520
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:00,876
>> UH-HUH.

521
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,877
>> I REALLY AM.

522
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,921
>> I FEEL BADLY FOR SKUPIN,

523
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,880
THOUGH, BECAUSE THE ONES THAT

524
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:05,464
ARE BACK THERE, THEY FIND

525
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,132
SOMETHING TO BE UPSET ABOUT

526
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:07,841
AFTER EVERY CHALLENGE.

527
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,134
>> IT'S LIKE THERE'S JUST

528
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,052
NEGATIVITY, YEAH.

529
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,138
THERE IS A BIT OF A GOOD VERSUS

530
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,598
EVIL DYNAMIC THE TRIBE RIGHT

531
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:14,765
NOW.

532
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,309
THE EVIL THREE BEING ARTIS, ABI,

533
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,143
PETE.

534
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,478
AND THE REST OF THE TRIBE

535
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,979
CONSIDERING THEMSELVES THE GOOD

536
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:21,230
GUYS.

537
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,066
>> IF YOU GET IN THEIR LINE OF

538
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:24,483
FIRE, YOU'RE GONE.

539
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,194
YOU'VE GOT TO JUST KISS THEIR

540
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,028
LITTLE BEHINDS.

541
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,196
>> I HATE THAT KIND OF BULLYING

542
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,826
AND THAT KIND OF DESPOTIC --

543
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,952
LIKE A TYRANT.

544
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,036
>> IT'S SOMETHING PENNER IS

545
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,579
TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO TURN

546
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,247
THE VOTE AGAINST ONE OF THE FLY

547
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,665
INSTEAD OF HIMSELF.

548
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,208
>> I HONESTLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT

549
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,168
I CAN WIN THE GAME AT THIS

550
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:43,419
POINT.

551
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,628
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY OF

552
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,214
THE FOUR OF YOU OR CARTER BE

553
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:47,423
THERE.

554
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,133
>> IT'S EASY FOR ME WHO'S GOT MY

00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,426
HEAD ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK TO

556
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,095
SAY YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A MOVE.

557
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,681
BUT I'M SAYING IT.

558
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,306
AND IF IT CAN HELP SAVE ME FOR

00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,142
ONE MORE VOTE I'D APPRECIATE IT

560
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,102
AND I THINK I CAN HELP YOU GUYS

561
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,062
GET IN CONTROL OF THE GAME.

I'M NEXT MANY THE CROSS FIRE,

00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,982
THEN SKUPIN, THEN PROBABLY YOU,

00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,234
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A WAYS TO

565
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:07,901
GO.

566
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,153
HONESTLY, THERE MUST BE A WAY TO

567
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,988
DIFFUSE THAT AND SAY WE CAN'T

568
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,073
LIVE IN A CAMP WITH TYRANNICAL

569
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,199
BULLIES, IT'S JUST NOT COOL.

570
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,075
>> CERTAINLY THE IDEA OF

571
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,370
BATTLING IT OUT AT THE END WITH

572
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,539
FOUR OTHER WORTHY OPPONENTS IS

573
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,166
SUCH A NOBLE CHOICE.

574
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,127
BUT I'M DISCOVERING THAT I'M NOT

575
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,086
TRYING TO JUST GET TO THE FINAL

576
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:26,295
FIVE.

577
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,839
I'M TRYING TO WIN, WHICH MEANS I

578
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,008
NEED TO FIRST GET TO THE FINAL

579
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,259
THREE WITH AS MANY PEOPLE THAT

580
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,303
AREN'T GOING TO GET MORE VOTES

581
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,429
THAN ME AS POSSIBLE.

582
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,765
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST HOW YOU GET

583
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:37,973
AHEAD.

584
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,099
THE SAME RULES DON'T APPLY IN

585
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,559
THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR" AS THEY

586
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:48,067
DO IN REAL LIFE.

587
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,215
PENNER GOES HOME, SOMEBODY'S

588
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,509
GOING TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE

589
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,427
THIS IS THE TIME TO DO A 5-4

590
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:15,719
ALLIANCE.

591
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,514
IT MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE FOR ME

592
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,265
AND SKUPIN TO GO TO THE END WITH

593
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,392
ABI AND ARTIS AND PETE BECAUSE

594
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,645
THEY HAVE MADE SO MANY ENEMIES

595
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,188
AND MADE SO MANY HOT HEAD

596
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,816
EMOTIONAL MOVES THAT HAVE TICKED

597
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,149
PEOPLE OFF.

598
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,569
>> PENNER, I GOT A PRETTY GOOD

599
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:32,820
CLAM.

600
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,445
>> I HAVE A PLAN THAT ASSURES

601
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,406
HIM THAT HE DOES NOT NEED TO

602
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
SCRAMBLE AND MAKE ALLIANCES WITH

603
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,660
SOMEBODY ELSE THAT'S GOING TO

604
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,829
PROMISE HIM THE WORLD BECAUSE

605
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:46,375
I'M GOING TO PROMISE HIM THE

00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,044
UNIVERSE.

607
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,630
I WANT TO TELL YOU MY PLAN.

608
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,131
I'LL LOOK YOU IN THE EYES AND I

00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,299
HAVE NOT TOLD ANYBODY THIS PLAN.

613
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,558
BUT MALCOLM HAS THE HIDDEN

614
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:02,933
IMMUNITY IDOL.

615
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,226
>> WOW.

616
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,937

617
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,313
MALCOLM AND DENICE AND ME.

HE'S JUST BEING MELLOW.

864
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,117
I MEAN, IT SUCKS BUT --

865
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,996
>> IT JUST THROWS A WRINKLE INTO

866
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,371
POTENTIALLY --

867
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:03,830

PENNER KIND OF DONE THE

871
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,004
UNTHINKABLE.

872
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,505
HE'S WON TWO CHALLENGES IN A

873
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,507
ROW-- ONE ON MY TEAM AND NOW ONE

874
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:14,841
BY HIMSELF.

875
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,675
SO HE'S JUST BOUGHT HIMSELF

876
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,139
ANOTHER THREE DAYS OF A DEAD MAN

877
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:21,389
WALKING.

878
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,974
WELL, SORRY, MAN, THAT'S THE

879
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,684
WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO

880
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:24,851
YOU.

881
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:25,810
>> NO SECRET.

882
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,105
NO SECRET AT ALL.

883
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,023
>> TOO BAD.

884
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,776
I WAS REALLY WANTING THE

885
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,905
OPPORTUNITY BUT -.

886
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,866
>> MALCOLM HAS THE HIDDEN

887
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,952
IMMUNITY IDOL FOR MATSING.

888
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,162
THE VERY FIRST DAY OF THE MERGE,

889
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:44,829
THIS WAS VERY INNOCENT ON MY

890
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,873
PART, I WAS SIMPLY TAKING ALL

891
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,250
THE CLOTHES OUT TO LET THEM DRY,

892
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:49,876
IT FOUND IN THE HIS BAG ON THE

893
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,337
FIRST DAY OF THE MERGE.

894
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,921
I TOLD HIM I WOULDN'T TELL

895
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,756
ANYBODY AND I HAVEN'T.

896
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,758
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF

897
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,801
HIM IS TO BLIND SIDE HIM SO HE

898
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:01,012
HAS TO THINK HE'S REALLY, REALLY

899
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:01,262
SAFE.

900
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,057
WE HAVE TO BLIND SIDE MALCOLM

901
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,393
TONIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO REALIZE

902
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,978
WHATEVER HE SAYS, HIS ALLEGIANCE

903
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,397
IS WITH THEM, NOT WITH US.

904
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,023
>> RIGHT.

905
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,025
THIS WHOLE ENTIRE PLAN, GETTING

906
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,652
RID OF MALCOLM AND HIM HAVING

907
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,737
THE IDOL, I GOT COMPLETELY

908
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,114
BLINDSIDED BY THAT BECAUSE I

909
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,951
ACTUALLY KIND OF TRUSTED MALCOLM

910
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:23,159
MALCOLM.

911
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,621
THIS PLAN RIGHT NOW IS LISA'S

912
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:26,871
PLAN.

913
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,622
IS IT A GOOD PLAN?

914
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,249
IS IT A PLAN THAT'S ACTUALLY

915
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,542
GOING TO BE EFFECT I HAVE

916
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,751
BECAUSE MALCOLM DOES HAVE AN

917
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,254
IDOL AND MALCOLM IS PLAYING TWO

918
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:34,462
SIDES?

919
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,966
I DON'T KNOW.

920
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,092
YOU'RE GOING WHO W MATSING?

921
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:39,384

>> YOU SURE?

923
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,471
>> NO, NO, IF I HAD THAT THING

924
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,305
MY PULSE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH

925
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,723
LOWER GOING TO YOUR TRIBE A FEW

926
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,015
WEEKS AGO.

927
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,685
>> ALL RIGHT.

928
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,227
>> SOMEBODY SAID I DID.

929
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,978
>> SOMEONE SAID YOU DID.

930
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,564
>> WHO SAID I DID?

931
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,940
>> LISA.

932
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,818
SHE SAYS YOU APPARENTLY HAVE THE

933
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,902
IDOL AND THAT'S THE WAY TO FISH

934
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,736
YOU OUT.

935
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,488
>> PETE CONFRONTS ME ABOUT THE

936
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,656
IDOL AND MY FIRST THOUGHT IS

937
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,450
JUST LIE, LIE, LIE, LIE.

938
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,993
BUT ALREADY MY HEART'S IN MY

939
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,369
STOMACH BECAUSE IF THAT RUMOR IS

940
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,371
OUT THERE IT'S GOING TO COME OUT

941
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:08,997
EVENTUALLY THAT I ACTUALLY TO

942
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,206
HAVE THE THING.

943
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,875
>> SO I HAVE TO GO SCRAMBLE FOR

944
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,167
IT NOW.

945
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,834
>> NO, DON'T SCRAMBLE.

946
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,169
I CAN SAVE YOU.

947
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,754
>> WHY NOT SEND HOME JEFF?

948
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,548
>> YOU WANT TO VOTE JEFF NOW?

949
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,009
>> THERE'S ENOUGH PEOPLE, LIKE

950
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,011
-- WE CAN SWITCH IT REALLY

951
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,219
QUICK.

952
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,679
>> I'LL GO JEFF IF THAT'S WHAT

953
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:25,513
YOU WANT ME TO DO.

954
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,890
>> THERE'S GOING TO BE FIVE

955
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,016
PEOPLE GOING.

956
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,851
>> JEFF'S BEHIND YOU.

957
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,604
>> MALCOLM FREAKED OUT AND -- I

958
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,480
MEAN, THAT RIGHT THERE WAS

959
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,149
ENOUGH OF A REACTION TO JUST

960
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:36,816
KIND OF KNOW -- LOOK INTO HIS

961
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,819
SOUL AND BE LIKE HE DOESN'T HAVE

962
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,111
THE IDOL.

963
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,030
SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT

964
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:42,864
LISA'S TRYING TO PULL HERE.

965
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,576
>> SO SHE'S SAYING I HAVE AN

966
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,827
IDOL FROM THE ORIGINAL MATSING.

967
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,245
>> SHE NEVER SAID THAT TO ME.

968
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,456
>> WELL, SHE TOLD ENOUGH PEOPLE.

969
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,125
>> YOU DON'T HAVE IT?

970
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,084
I WAS GOING TO SAY PLAY IT IF

971
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:55,752
YOU GOT IT.

972
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,629
>> I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS GOING

973
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:57,837
ON.

974
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,254
>> YUP.

975
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:58,963
>> SO WHAT'S THE VOTE?

976
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,798
>> JEFF.

977
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,258
>> JEFF?

978
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:07,722
>> JEFF.

979
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,181
IS IT JEFF?

980
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,015
>> ALL RIGHT.

981
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,226
>> WE JUST NEED TO CHILL OUT.

982
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,644
>> YEAH.

983
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,145
>> WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

984
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,480
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS FINE

985
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:15,897
FIVE MINUTES AGO.

986
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,898
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE VOTING OUT

987
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:17,106
JEFF.

988
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,776
I WANTED JEFF OUT SECOND ANYWAY.

989
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,069
IF PENNER LOST I WOULD HAVE KEPT

990
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,862
SKUPIN AROUND AS THE SWING VOTE

991
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,822
BUT RIGHT NOW JEFF'S GOING HOME.

992
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,574
HE'S A NICE GUY, HE'S PLAYED A

993
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,867
GREAT GAME BUT HE'S A BIG THREAT

994
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,285
AND I WANT HIM GONE.

995
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,372
>> OKAY, SO -- MALCOLM'S GOING

996
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,039
ASK IF I SAID -- TOLD YOU ABOUT

997
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,251
THE IDOL.

998
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,126
>> RIGHT.

999
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,295
>> AND DID YOU TELL HIM THAT I

1000
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:39,587
TOLD YOU?

1001
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,839
>> NO.

1002
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,967
I JUST TOLD HIM THAT WE KNOW.

1003
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,301
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.

1004
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,888
>> AND WHAT'D YOU SAY?

1005
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:58,523
>> I JUST -- I WASING.

1006
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:03,820
>> WAIT A SECOND, DON'T GO YET.

1007
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,238
(SIGHS)

1008
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,407
WELL, MALCOLM PULLED PETE ASIDE,

1009
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,575
PETE WAS THROWN OFF GUARD AND

1010
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,868
WASN'T VERY GOOD AT CONVINCING

1011
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,705
HIM THAT HIS NAME WASN'T ON THE

1012
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,372
CHOPPING BLOCK SO EVERYTHING

1013
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,832
JUST HIT THE FAN.

1014
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,750
ARE THEY WANTING TO VOTE ME NOW?

1015
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,878
>> NO.

1016
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,129
UH-UH.

1017
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,505
IT WOULD BE JEFF.

1018
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,090
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST VOTE HIM

1019
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:24,257
OUT.

1020
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,800
PLAYING THE MASTERMIND ROLE IS

1021
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:26,509
VERY HARD WORK.

1022
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,468
IT'S NOT EASY.

1023
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,053
AND YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW YOU'RE

1024
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:29,470
THE MASTERMIND.

1025
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,097
IT'S JUST THAT LAST -- RIGHT

1026
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,682
BEFORE TRIBAL IS WHEN YOU REALLY

1027
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,142
FIGURE OUT DO YOU REALLY HAVE

1028
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,268
EVERYBODY AND IS IT SOLID.

1029
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:39,689
>> WATCH OUT, JEFF'S BEHIND YOU.

1030
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,065
>> SOME GOSSIP GOING ON AROUND

1031
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:41,316
HERE?

1032
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,817
WHAT THE HELL?

1033
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,277
>> WE'RE BOTH BEING TOSSED

1034
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,153
AROUND RIGHT NOW.

1035
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,863
>> WE COULD GET SIX RIGHT NOW.

1036
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,073
>> SKUPIN, DENICE, PENNER,

1037
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:49,782
CARTER WILL GO?

1038
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,199
>> YEAH.

1039
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,160
>> I SAY WE DO IT RIGHT NOW.

1040
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,662
>> WE WERE ALL SET TO GO AHEAD

1041
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,664
AND LET SKUPIN GO BUT NOW I

1042
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,874
FOUND OUT THEY WERE GUNNING FOR

1043
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,082
ME.

1044
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,375
BUT HOPEFULLY THE BULLET'S GOING

1045
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,753
TO GO IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

1046
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,254
>> EITHER PETER OR ABI?

1047
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,214
>> PETE?

1048
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,924
>> WE COULD CUT THE HEAD OF THE

1049
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:07,342
SNAKE OFF RIGHT NOW.

1050
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,052
>> ALL RIGHT.

1051
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,553
>> TALK TO DENICE.

1052
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,180
>> DENICE, SIX PEOPLE ARE VOTING

1053
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,973
PETE TONIGHT.

1054
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:14,682
WHICH AM ANY.

1055
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,101
>> ME, YOU, JEFF, PENNER,

1056
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:17,352
CARTER.

1057
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,603
>> OKAY.

1058
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,187
>> SKUPIN.

1059
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,188
>> OKAY, GOT IT.

1060
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,273
>> LET'S GET A TARP UP ON THIS

1061
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:26,778
TREE RIGHT HERE.

1062
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,821
>> WE ALL KNOW IT HAS TO BE DONE

1063
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,489
AT SOME POINT.

1064
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:33,159
WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT.

1065
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,036
>> PETE'S GOING HOME.

1066
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,204
WE GOT ALL SIX VOTES.

1067
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,413
>> I THOUGHT THEY WERE SENDING

1068
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,125
YOU HOME TONIGHT.

1069
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,878
>> EVERYBODY'S GOING MAD IN THE

1070
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:44,629
PAST HOUR.

1071
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,214
LISA RAN HER MOUTH ABOUT MY

1072
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,131
IDOL, I'M PLAYING DUMB TRYING TO

1073
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,300
PLAY IN THIS VOTE, BUT IT'S

1074
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,259
COMING WITH ME TONIGHT.

1075
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,261
IF THIS THING EVEN SEEMS CLOSE

1076
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,388
I'M PLAYING IT.

1077
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,180
I'M VOTING FOR PETE RIGHT NOW.

1078
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,391
CUT THE HEAD OFF THE SNAKE.

1079
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,058
THIS IS NOT THE WAY I SAW IT

1080
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,893
GOING AT ALL.

1081
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,186
I WANTED TO TRY TO GET RID OF

1082
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,646
SKUPIN BUT IT'S GOING TO BE HELL

1083
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,605
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO.

1084
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,189
THIS IS THE MOST LAST-MINUTE

1085
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,358
CRAZY THING I'VE EVER BEEN A

1086
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:21,916
PART OF IN MY LIFE.

1087
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,418
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1088
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,129
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1089
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,839
R.C. VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1090
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,926
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1091
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,513
>> RIGHT ON.

1092
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,139
>> Jeff: SO AT THE LAST TRIBAL

1093
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,141
COUNCIL THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK

1094
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,559
ABOUT RETURNING PLAYERS NOT

1095
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,476
BEING WELCOMED.

1096
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,229
SO SKUPIN, THE MINUTE PENNER

1097
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,272
WINS IMMUNITY DOES THAT POINT

1098
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,064
THE FINGER THEN AT YOU?

1099
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,483
>> I FELT A LOT OF PRESSURE

1100
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:47,775
INSTANTLY.

1101
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,110
BUT WHEN I CAME BACK TO CAMP, IT

1102
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,611
TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF THE

1103
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,613
PRESSURE OFF WHEN I HEARD SOME

1104
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,281
PEOPLE TALKING.

1105
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:57,118
(LAUGHS)

1106
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,745
>> Jeff: MALCOLM?

1107
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,747
>> I PUT MY FAITH IN A LITTLE

1108
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,998
TEXAS GIRL AND SHE THREW ME

1109
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,501
UNDER THE BUS PRETTY HARD TODAY.

1110
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,461
>> Jeff: LISA?

1111
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,712
THREW SOMEONE UNDER THE BUS?

1112
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,088
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

1113
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,049
IT WAS GOING TO BE AN EASY VOTE

1114
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,178
UNTIL PENNER WON IMMUNITY.

1115
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,472
BACKUP PLAN WAS MICHAEL.

1116
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,765
BUT MICHAEL HAS BEEN THE STRONG

1117
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,141
MEMBER OF THE TANDANG TRIBE FROM

1118
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,393
THE VERY BEGINNING SO WHY NOT

1119
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,020
ELIMINATE WHOM I THOUGHT WAS THE

1120
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,105
BIGGEST THREAT IN THE GAME--

1121
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,190
WHICH WOULD BE MALCOLM.

1122
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,358
>> Jeff: SO IF WE JUST LOOK AT

1123
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,152
IT FROM HERE, THERE'S THE

1124
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,447
TANDANG FIVE-- LISA, ABI, PETE,

1125
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,199
SKUPIN, AND ARTIS-- AND THEN

1126
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,785
THERE'S THE KALABAW FOUR--

1127
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,703
PENNER, JEFF, DENICE, AND

1128
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:40,995
CARTER.

1129
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,997
AND THEN THERE'S YOU, MALCOLM.

1130
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,499
DENICE, DOES THAT GIVE YOU SOME

1131
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,958
HOPE THAT, HEY, THERE'S OUR

1132
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,418
FIFTH RIGHT THERE AND WE'RE

1133
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,252
SQUARE UP 5-5 AGAIN?

1134
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,212
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1135
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,548
EVERY CRACK IS AN OPPORTUNITY.

1136
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,174
>> Jeff: SO ABI, IT HAS TO

1137
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,426
GIVE YOU A BIT OF CONCERN TO

1138
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,970
FIND OUT THAT ONE OF YOUR TRIBE

1139
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:58,638
MEMBERS JUST SCREW IT HAD WHOLE

1140
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,680
GAME UP.

1141
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,724
>> YES, AND I ALWAYS FELT THAT

1142
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,392
MALCOLM WAS A PART OF US SO I AM

1143
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,477
IN AWE RIGHT NOW.

1144
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,979
I THINK THIS IS REALLY

1145
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,271
LUDICROUS.

1146
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:07,855
>> BUT YOU WERE WILLING FOR

1147
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,524
MICHAEL TO GO HOME WHO WAS PART

1148
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,776
OF THE TANDANG TRIBE ORIGINALLY.

1149
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,152
>> BUT MICHAEL AND R.C. WAS

1150
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,487
ALWAYS ON THE OUTSIDE.

1151
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,116
IT WAS ALWAYS YOU, ME, PETER AND

1152
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,367
ARTIS.

1153
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,576
AND MALCOLM WAS ALWAYS PART OF

1154
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,452
OUR ALLIANCE AS WELL.

1155
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,371
>> BUT YOU JUST --

1156
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,539
>> Jeff: IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE

1157
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,915
FOR THAT ONE ABI.

1158
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,416
>> I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

1159
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:27,708
I'M SORRY.

1160
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,002
MALCOLM WAS WAY STRONGER IN OUR

1161
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,712
ALLIANCE THAN SKUPIN EVER WAS.

1162
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,381
>> BUT IF SOMEBODY HAS A HIDDEN

1163
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,216
IMMUNITY IDOL YOU TRY TO FLUSH

1164
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,802
IT OUT OR TRUE TRY TO BLIND SAID

1165
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,469
THEM BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE THREAT

1166
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,887
IN THE GAME.

1167
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,556
>> Jeff: SO, LISA, YOU'RE

1168
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,642
SAYING MALCOLM HAS A HIDDEN

1169
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,643
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU KNOW IT?

1170
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,227
>> YES.

1171
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,520
AND I DID BRING THAT INFORMATION

1172
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,230
TO MAKE THE TANDANG TRIBE

1173
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:49,564
STRONGER.

1174
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,524
I WAS PLAYING BOTH SIDES, BUT MY

1175
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,820
ALLEGIANCE WAS TO THE ORIGINAL

1176
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,112
ALLIANCE.

1177
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:56,404
>> Jeff: OH.

1178
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,822
>> JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR.

1179
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,406
THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH CHAOS

1180
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:58,614
TONIGHT.

1181
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,533
I'M NOT GOING HOME.

1182
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,451
SO THIS THING IS GETTING PLAYED.

1183
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,286
IT'S PUT A TARGET ON MY BACK.

1184
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,288
I'M NOT DEALING WITH IT ANYMORE

1185
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,665
AND IF ANYBODY'S JUMPED ON

1186
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,916
LISA'S BOAT AND DECIDES TO VOTE

1187
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,585
FOR ME, YOU MIGHT BE IN FOR A

1188
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,463
MEAN SURPRISE IN A SECOND.

1189
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,882
>> Jeff: ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO

1190
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,174
REVEAL THEY HAVE AN IDOL?

1191
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,552
GET IT OUT?

1192
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,430
>> I HAVE IT, YES.

1193
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,601
I HAVE IT.

1194
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,770
>> THIS IS AWESOME!

1195
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,898
I WAS SELFLESSLY HAVING THIS TO

1196
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,316
PROTECT PEOPLE IN MY ALLIANCE.

1197
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,233
HERE, EVERYONE.

1198
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,027
>> GREAT TRIBAL.

1199
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,155
>> FANTASTIC, MAN!

1200
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,115
>> Jeff: WOW.

1201
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,366
I DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT TO

1202
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,077
SAY MYSELF BEFORE WE GO TO THE

1203
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:45,286
VOTE.

1204
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,038
>> WELL, I'D LIKE TO ASK

1205
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:47,330
SOMETHING.

1206
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,289
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE SIX

1207
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,332
OF US RIGHT HERE WHO CAN MARCH

1208
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,208
FORWARD IN THIS GAME.

1209
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,877
THAT MEANS KEEPING SKUPIN AND I

1210
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,629
IN THAT SIX, AT LEAST FOR A

1211
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,046
WHILE.

1212
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,255
YOU GUYS READY TO DO THAT?

1213
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,256
>> WE'VE DISCUSSED THOSE OPTIONS

1214
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,008
AND MANY MORE.

1215
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,343
I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT

1216
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:00,593
THAT.

1217
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,260
>> YES.

1218
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:01,844
>> OKAY.

1219
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,096
YOU GUYS READY TO DO THAT,

1220
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,264
CARTER?

1221
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,641
SKUPIN?

1222
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,433
>> WOW.

1223
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,269
>> WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO AT

1224
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,688
LEAST MAKE MY PROPOSAL AND THAT

1225
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,315
IS ANYBODY I HAVE GIVEN MY WORD

1226
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,317
TO WE CAN STILL KEEP THE

1227
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,861
MAJORITY IF WE GO WITH PLAN "B"

1228
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,404
AND HOPEFULLY THIS PROVES I AM

1229
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,366
LOYAL ENOUGH TO TAKE THE

1230
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,408
OFFENSIVE MOVE FOR US TO SECURE

1231
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,410
THE NUMBERS OF THOSE WHO ARE IN

1232
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,871
OUR CORE ALLIANCE.

1233
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,164
>> Jeff: SO IT SOUNDS LIKE

1234
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,167
THERE ARE TWO PITCHES: LISA'S

1235
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,961
SAYING PLA PLAN "B"--

1236
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,504
INVOLVES ONE OF THOSE SIX.

1237
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,257
PENNER'S SAYING LET'S TAKE THE

1238
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,299
SIX AND VOTE OUT EITHER LISA,

1239
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,176
ABI, PETE OR ARTIS.

1240
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,594
>> I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE COMING

1241
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,428
AFTER ME.

1242
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:44,845
>> Jeff: WHY YOU?

1243
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,555
>> MY NAME'S BEEN THROWN AROUND

1244
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,225
THE ISLAND THE ENTIRE TIME WE'VE

1245
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,226
MERGED SO IT'S PROBABLY ME.

1246
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,560
>> AND MY NAME'S BEEN THROWN

1247
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,146
UNDER THE HAT AS MUCH AS PETE'S,

1248
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,231
SO'S MALCOLM'S.

1249
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,024
AND PENNER AND SKUPIN.

1250
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,151
AND LEE'S SAA'S PROBABLY ON THE

1251
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,903
CHOPPING BLOCK AND NOW ABI, TOO.

1252
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,198
THIS IS PRETTY FUN, JEFF.

1253
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:08,869
>> Jeff: I'VE GOT TO SAY, I

1254
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,621
DIDN'T THINK OF A MORE

1255
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,455
COMPLICATED TRIBAL COUNCIL EVER

1256
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,708
IN MY TIME OF TRIBAL.

1257
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:13,916
>> NICE!

1258
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,252
>> Jeff: IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1259
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:21,799
ARTIS, YOU'RE UP.

1260
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,059
>> WELL, I SAID YOU WERE PLAN

1261
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,853
"B" BUT I THINK THIS WAS

1262
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:46,115
ACTUALLY PLAN D OR PLAN E.

1263
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,951
>> PETE, IT WAS FANTASTIC TO

1264
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:49,577
WATCH YOUR LITTLE AHRAOEUBS JUST

1265
00:38:49,660 --> 00:39:10,473
KIND OF IMPLODE ON ITSELF.

1266
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,939
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1267
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:25,237
VOTES.

1268
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,614
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1269
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,657
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1270
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,326
NOW IS MOST DEFINITELY THE TIME

1271
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:46,258
TO DO SO.

1272
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,011
NOBODY PLAYING THEIR IDOL?

1273
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,763
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE RED,

1274
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,680
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1275
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,141
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1276
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,393
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1277
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:56,977
IMMEDIATELY.

1278
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,562
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1279
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,525
