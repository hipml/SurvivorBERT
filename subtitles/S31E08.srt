2
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,478
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,085
In a season dedicated 
to second chances,

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,117
each was trying to change 
their story in the game.

5
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:11,771
I want to do everything 
I didn't do the first time.

6
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:13,179
Go hard or get out.

7
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:16,358
I create relationships 
that have saved me.

8
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,685
I blame myself

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,253
not to have eliminated 
the young prodigy, the last time.

10
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:22,288
I'm so invested this time...

11
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:23,705
At the merger,

12
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,026
the battle for the majority 
was raging.

13
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,770
Let's review the list.

14
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,140
You have to be operational from the outset 
to be a majority in the first vote.

15
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:36,177
But for Joe, 
the No. 1 priority was to win.

16
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:39,414
Joe wins 
the first individual immunity!

17
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:42,008
On the camp, Kass was in trouble

18
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,852
and was looking to make a big hit.

19
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,926
If there's five of us, we can take Tasha out.

20
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:49,090
At the council, Ciera was up for it.

21
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,593
We are old. 
Play to win!

22
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,229
But not everyone was ready 
to pull the trigger...

23
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,780
First member of the jury...

24
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,900
...leaving Ciera, Abi and Wentworth 
at the bottom of the ladder.

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,102
Kass, the tribe has spoken.

26
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,229
There are 12 left.

27
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,279
Who will be eliminated tonight?

28
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:34,471
A brilliant plan, 
perfectly executed.

29
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:35,729
Yeah, that's good.

30
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:38,073
The last tip was amazing.

31
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,220
My 1st goal in Survivor: 
reach the jury.

32
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:42,136
I was like, 
"Wow, I did it!"

33
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:46,674
It's rare in life 
to have a huge, huge dream,

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,890
that follows you for years,

35
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,781
and suddenly it happens!

36
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,866
- It was so good. 
- It worked fine.

37
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:56,468
We are on day 20. My job 
is to preserve my alliance,

38
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:59,194
old-fashioned, and stay the course.

39
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:02,097
Eliminate the Cieras, 
the Abis, the Wentworths.

40
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:04,992
I think of Ciera: "Play!"

41
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,470
It just means: 
"All against the guys!"

42
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,794
That's all.

43
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,818
- You mean Joe? 
- Yeah.

44
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:13,633
They will try something.

45
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,144
At one point.

46
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,118
We just have to find out when.

47
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,674
I keep an eye.

48
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,282
They simmer a big blow,

49
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,779
I see it in their eyes.

50
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:25,349
The trick is to understand 
who they target

51
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:27,881
and counter it as best we can.

52
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:30,510
- It's funny. 
- The day will be good.

53
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:31,783
It's certain.

54
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:42,142
- How are you after last night? 
- How are you.

55
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:44,687
I expected to have votes.

56
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,542
But this game is constantly changing.

57
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:50,898
At this point, 
I'm at the bottom of the ladder.

58
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,719
I will try everything I can

59
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:56,452
hoping 
to provoke a reaction.

60
00:02:56,577 --> 00:03:00,989
You are in the majority, 
my hands are tied.

61
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:04,597
I think Stephen 
wants to hit the big time.

62
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:06,820
He waits for the right moment.

63
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:10,432
It's about convincing him 
that it's the right time.

64
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,093
It will clearly fracture 
at some point.

65
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,870
I want to install things 
that will pay off later.

66
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,232
So, I'll tell you. 
If it was up to me

67
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:21,601
I would take action against Joe if he lost.

68
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,980
Ciera is in a bad position,

69
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,008
but we have in common 
to want to make the moves

70
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,852
we need 
to be in a position to win.

71
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,881
We don't need 
everyone, just...

72
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:35,032
- By a majority. 
- ...of six people.

73
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:37,303
Ciera wants to turn the game upside down. 
So do I.

74
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:38,842
I don't want to be passive

75
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:41,021
and get knocked down 
by a bunch of tough guys.

76
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,422
It's time to act

77
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:45,347
and target someone 
really dangerous.

78
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,235
Over here, everyone!

79
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:32,547
- Ready for the reward test? 
- Yes !

80
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,463
Today 
you will form two teams of six.

81
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,522
At my top, you will paddle 
to a series of crates.

82
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:44,559
You'll jump, untie 
them, place them on board, and continue.

83
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:48,288
When you get 'em all, 
you'll stack 'em up

84
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,885
so that no color 
repeats on either side.

85
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,669
The first to finish 
win the reward.

86
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,732
- Do you want to know what's at stake? 
- Yeah !

87
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:59,574
The six winners 
will be taken to CafÃ© Survivor.

88
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,935
You will start with iced coffee.

89
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,803
Bagels and fresh cheese.

90
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,330
Cookies.

91
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:09,919
You will overdose 
on caffeine and sugar

92
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:13,194
and return to camp 
bounding like rabbits.

93
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,991
The very first rowing event

94
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,851
took place in season 1,

95
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:19,614
where Kelly Wiglesworth,

96
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,113
the river guide,

97
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,010
who earns his living by paddling,

98
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:24,738
lost against Gervase,

99
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,368
15 years ago.

100
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,371
- Do you still remember? 
- Well yes.

101
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,381
And he couldn't swim, as a bonus. 
I help you a little.

102
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:33,633
The quote was:

103
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:36,202
"I lost to the guy 
who can't swim."

104
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:39,071
So, big second chance 
for Wiglesworth.

105
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:41,141
We will form the teams 
like a schoolyard

106
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:43,018
and we'll start.

107
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:49,257
Here are the two teams 
that were formed.

108
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:54,696
Ciera and Keith.

109
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,389
They will face Tasha,

110
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,336
Fishbach and Abi.

111
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:03,563
Let's go. Survivors, ready?

112
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,479
Everyone must board.

113
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,348
Then you can paddle.

114
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,941
Let's go ! 1, 2, 3!

115
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:21,029
You have to navigate in the middle.

116
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:23,895
- Yes yes ! 
- On the right side, Keith!

117
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,652
Joe and Keith are in trouble.

118
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:28,096
- Attention ! 
- What are you doing ?!

119
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,731
One more time,

120
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,157
the wiglesworth team

121
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,268
has difficulty paddling.

122
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,237
Come on, everyone!

123
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,030
You have to go around the flag

124
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,007
before picking up the crates.

125
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,009
All right, those on the left!

126
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,880
She put her team back on track, 
perfect equality at the bend.

127
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,055
And now 
that you're going to meet...

128
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,299
Block-them, Keith!

129
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,770
...you have to cross 
to get to the checkouts.

130
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:52,454
- Good game ! 
- [???]

131
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,724
Joe deflected the other team!

132
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:58,093
- Backward ! 
- Backward !

133
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,484
Keith is in the water for the Greens.

134
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:03,899
That's good, Keith!

135
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,059
Abi is in the water for his team.

136
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,402
Closer !

137
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,538
Keith untied the first box.

138
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:13,166
Abi is still working 
on the 1st crate.

139
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,071
Closer ! Left !

140
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,740
Kimmi and Keith are in the lead.

141
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:23,009
- We have it ! 
- Keith, get back in the water.

142
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:24,788
Catch her!

143
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:27,122
Abi has finally undone the knots.

144
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,456
Ahead !

145
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:31,681
Joe tries to pull up the 2nd box.

146
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:33,461
They are heavy!

147
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:36,298
This is the purple team.

148
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:38,158
I can do it.

149
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:41,937
This is Spencer, 
for his team's second crate.

150
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,363
He replaced Abi.

151
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:46,108
Big lead for the Greens.

152
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:49,079
The Wiglesworth Tribe 
has two funds.

153
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,905
Spencer has the 2nd crate on his team.

154
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:54,608
The Violets are fighting to come back up.

155
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:59,112
Spencer falls into the water, 
he has to come back up!

156
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:00,650
Go-y, Keith!

157
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,292
Keith unties 
the 3rd crate from his team.

158
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,785
- Row! 
- Go on !

159
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,930
Joe and Keith work very well 
with these funds.

160
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:13,069
A new cash advance 
for the Greens.

161
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,369
You and are you going?

162
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:18,284
Spencer returns to the water 
for the 3rd crate.

163
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:19,466
Spread them!

164
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,712
It is Joe who fetches 
the 4th and last crate.

165
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:25,541
I have foot.

166
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,560
If it's shallow, 
you can push.

167
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:29,317
As soon as I have it, jump and let's go.

168
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,656
Maintain balance.

169
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,855
Spencer, still on his team's 3rd crate 
.

170
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,742
Hey, get closer to him!

171
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,357
Meanwhile, 
his team drifts away from him,

172
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:42,393
forcing Spencer 
to swim back to the boat.

173
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:46,724
- Joe has the 4th crate. 
- Let's go!

174
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,361
They're coming back to the beach!

175
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,005
Come on, forward!

176
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,473
Big advance.

177
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,767
- Keith, do you have one? 
- I do not know.

178
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,269
- Can I take it? 
- Yeah, after him.

179
00:08:58,396 --> 00:08:59,796
Kimmi, is it okay?

180
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,486
Let's go!

181
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:03,871
All of them work together 
with these funds.

182
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,454
Joe carries only one.

183
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,748
That's how it's done in Survivor!

184
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,880
They will have a big lead 
on the puzzle.

185
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,253
Come on, Keith, let's go!

186
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,530
Spencer goes back into the water.

187
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,899
They have plenty of time 
to catch up.

188
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,308
- Quick ! 
- It's good.

189
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,461
- I can not stand it anymore. 
- It's good. I love you.

190
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,065
The Violets finally have their 4th crate.

191
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,375
Spencer has to get back on board. 
Activate!

192
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:32,881
Kimmi, Ciera and Wentworth

193
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,184
all have their boxes. 
Start stacking them!

194
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:40,188
Come on, we have to cross the beach!

195
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:42,515
It's gonna take 
a lot of teamwork

196
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,526
to make up for lost time.

197
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,669
These crates are hard to lift.

198
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:49,389
Place them in the structure.

199
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:52,734
Jeremy wears one on his shoulders.

200
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,159
It does the work of two people.

201
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,474
You have to place the four crates 
before attacking the puzzle.

202
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:06,748
You are now looking to 
repeat no colors

203
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,149
on each side.

204
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,343
If you see the same color, 
it's wrong.

205
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:12,587
It will not work.

206
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:13,889
Like that !

207
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:16,320
This one is false. 
You have to turn it.

208
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,894
Lots of teamwork 
at the Violets.

209
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,061
They progress quickly and well, 
they go up.

210
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,690
It's very tight again.

211
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:25,698
Everyone is on the puzzle.

212
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:26,835
Turn it!

213
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,725
All it takes 
is no repeating color.

214
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,664
I have yellow, green, green, red.

215
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:34,776
Turn it all the way, Savage! 
Yes, one more shot!

216
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,152
- Yes ! 
- If you think you have it...

217
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:38,972
- ...say it to me ! 
- We got it, Jeff!

218
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:44,219
Nope ! There is a duplicate red!

219
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,520
Oh, almost!

220
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,955
Carry on!

221
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,163
Fishbach thought he had it, but no! 
You have to try something else.

222
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,459
I am sorry.

223
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,752
Spin it again!

224
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,230
- Green on your side. 
- I have green here.

225
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,399
- Here and here. 
- Jeff!

226
00:10:58,152 --> 00:10:59,457
Yes that's it !

227
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:02,037
You have it ! The reward !

228
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,206
For Keith, Kimmi, Ciera,

229
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:10,345
Huge victory!

230
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:14,007
I wanted it so much.

231
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,047
the idea behind Second Chance,

232
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:24,626
it is in particular to get rid 
of what has haunted you.

233
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:26,016
Does it erase

234
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:28,496
the memory of the defeat 
against Gervase 15 years ago?

235
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,132
Yes, I'm not going to lie, 
it's awesome!

236
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,407
Nice reward.

237
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:34,421
You will be taken to CafÃ© Survivor.

238
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,478
Coffee, sandwiches, desserts.

239
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:38,198
It should be a good respite.

240
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,665
And with so many people at stake,

241
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,918
who knows what impact 
this will have on strategy?

242
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:45,202
Grab your things and go. 
Good afternoon !

243
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:46,806
- Thank you, Jeff! 
- Thanks !

244
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,720
Tasha, Jeremy, Savage, 
I have nothing for you.

245
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,834
Take your things, 
return to camp.

246
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,725
The idea that Joe and the girls 
share a reward

247
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,983
is terrifying.

248
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:01,693
I want to eliminate it. But now they have 
the opportunity to influence it.

249
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,323
And that could ruin everything.

250
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:21,019
- Come on, let's go! 
- Damn it !

251
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:24,953
We were taken to the reward 
on these little...

252
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,256
How do you call this ? 
Motorcycle stuff.

253
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:30,823
We arrive at this cool little cafe.

254
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,361
Welcome to CafÃ© Tuk-tuk! 
Serve yourself !

255
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:35,230
Oh, my... Kimmi! Looked !

256
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,499
- Oh my God ! 
- Oh my God !

257
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:39,284
I was so excited!

258
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:41,603
It was my very first reward

259
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,727
with food, 
all seasons combined,

260
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:45,732
so it was really special.

261
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:49,945
It's nice to get a glimpse 
of life outside the game,

262
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,338
just a moment.

263
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:55,241
- It's incredible. 
- That's really nice.

264
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,185
We worked together really well.

265
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,199
That's what they missed, I think.

266
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:01,815
Rewards 
are extremely important.

267
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,894
This is the perfect moment, 
in a relaxed atmosphere,

268
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,319
to talk about strategy.

269
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:08,380
when people relax

270
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:11,791
and then you submit your idea, 
they are more receptive.

271
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,182
I see an opportunity

272
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,073
to brainstorm ideas 
and build relationships.

273
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,467
When I was talking about playing last night

274
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,147
I didn't mean 
that no one was playing.

275
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:26,487
But in my 1st season, 
there was a close-knit group,

276
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,575
of which I was a part,

277
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,258
and I thought I could 
make a move afterwards.

278
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:33,146
But my numbers have shrunk.

279
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,415
At this point, I have nothing to lose.

280
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,111
So I fish.

281
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:40,534
I cast the line 
and wait for it to bite,

282
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:43,598
hoping someone 
wants to play the same game as me.

283
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,991
And I'll tell you.

284
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:49,004
These four

285
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,316
will not separate.

286
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:51,598
I promise you.

287
00:13:51,723 --> 00:13:53,542
As long as there are enough of us,

288
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,351
it might be time to act.

289
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:56,736
I'm with the Bayons.

290
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,739
I proved my loyalty to them, 
they know that I am with them.

291
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,608
But Ciera is right.

292
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,243
I know they are welded.

293
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,945
I know that at some point 
they won't want me anymore.

294
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:09,007
Jeremy and Stephen are smart.

295
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:11,826
Stephen will give it a shot, 
within 2 or 3 votes.

296
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:15,163
He knows the numbers, 
he knows his game. Believe me.

297
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:17,637
Loyalty has its limits.

298
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:21,051
Myself, 
I will not always be loyal.

299
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:23,505
It is only

300
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,075
to be sure to act at the right time, 
with the right people.

301
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,880
What are these things called? 
Rickshaws? No.

302
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:31,838
- Tuk-tuks. 
- To-tos, ouais.

303
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:33,506
I'll take a look.

304
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,909
I will see. I had a Trail 70.

305
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:37,552
No drunk driving!

306
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,014
Let's see if I can start it.

307
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:42,916
A gear is engaged, I believe.

308
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,359
Don't break it!

309
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:57,097
Look at it there!

310
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,905
We will see Keith, in ten years, 
retired, on the beach,

311
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,736
and this is what he will do!

312
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,982
I need passengers!

313
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,143
We don't have any beaches 
in Louisiana to drive on.

314
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:12,515
So this is a unique opportunity.

315
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,646
Here I am,

316
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:16,458
driving a tuk-tuk, 
on a beach, in Cambodia.

317
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:18,072
With my friends.

318
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,087
To drive them around like a taxi.

319
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:25,700
Let's see if this beauty 
is all-terrain!

320
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:33,299
Now I'm going to pass 
my Cambodian driver's license!

321
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,049
It would be nice.

322
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:38,878
Easy taxi home! 
Call, I'll come get you!

323
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:57,791
I can't get over it.

324
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,834
I'm depressed there.

325
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,628
Move on !

326
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,254
I don't know why it affects me so much. 
Sorry to be...

327
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,535
A squealing baby!

328
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,918
Typically, in Survivor, 
I think to myself:

329
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:11,680
no matter the reward.

330
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,890
But miss it, today,

331
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,713
miss the food, 
miss the opportunity to bond,

332
00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:19,654
miss the opportunity 
to replenish your energy,

333
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,135
it really got me down.

334
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,145
The reward, it helps, 
it's super nice, then it's over.

335
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,253
It's that I also partly 
lost my season on a reward.

336
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:31,099
Some of the bonds made there, 
I could never catch up with.

337
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:34,033
- You lost for lack of links? 
- Do you think they're getting closer?

338
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:35,994
In this situation.

339
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:39,576
I don't know if that's the case usually, 
or now.

340
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:43,503
The people I need to act 
on are out there bonding with Joe.

341
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,938
And Joe is the enemy.

342
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,407
It could be terrible for me. 
It's my nightmare.

343
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:49,581
To see it escape me again

344
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:52,587
because of a stupid 
reward trial.

345
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:54,908
I was thinking.

346
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,763
I don't want to spend days 
getting rid of

347
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:02,826
of all the Ciera and Abi in the world 
when there are real threats.

348
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:05,832
That's not what we're going to do.

349
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,608
So I thought to myself:

350
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:11,075
if Joe loses, it's time 
to get rid of him.

351
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,342
Since day 1, 
Stephen has been trying to get Joe out.

352
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:18,947
I was reluctant, 
because I would lose a shield with Joe.

353
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:21,241
But every time Joe wins,

354
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:24,544
it enlarges the target 
behind him.

355
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,956
So the first time Joe loses, 
he could leave.

356
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,036
I don't want 
tomorrow to be consecrated...

357
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:32,185
- Shenanigans. 
- And come up with a plan.

358
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,454
I follow you.

359
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,822
If my allies are in, 
I'm in.

360
00:17:35,947 --> 00:17:37,724
It all goes back to my loss to JT.

361
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,702
I don't want to be the puppet 
we take to the final.

362
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:43,672
But that means 
I take the reins.

363
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:45,974
I thought if Joe loses,

364
00:17:46,224 --> 00:17:50,078
I could find the voices 
to eliminate him by surprise.

365
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,426
It's fusion 
in an all-star season,

366
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,349
you have to aim for the strong.

367
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,165
And the low probability 
that he anticipates it increases our chances.

368
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,789
This is also my opinion. 
He won't see it coming now.

369
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:01,915
- But... 
- Yes, I'm in, but...

370
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,592
Stephen wants Joe out.

371
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,719
He does what it takes to get it.

372
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,963
At each immunity test,

373
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,423
whatever it is, 
Joe has a good chance of winning.

374
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,035
It would be foolish not to eliminate him 
at the first opportunity.

375
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:16,489
What's new ?

376
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:19,441
I wanted to check in with you. 
I have a few ideas.

377
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:21,831
I thought...

378
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:23,576
If Joe loses,

379
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,709
How about eliminating him by surprise ?

380
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:27,708
It's a possibility.

381
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,309
There are enough of us for that.

382
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,472
But it should come 
by surprise, of course.

383
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:34,328
Today I heard Stephen

384
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:36,324
attempt to arrange 
Joe's elimination.

385
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,518
These conspiracies, 
these lies, these deceptions...

386
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:40,028
It's disgusting.

387
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,689
Because I have a great alliance with Joe. 
I love this guy.

388
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:44,611
So he's not going anywhere.

389
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:46,799
I'm going to have to face Stephen.

390
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,402
Let the battle begin!

391
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,549
Stand up company!

392
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:05,537
What's up, buddy?

393
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:07,322
- Do you have a minute? 
- Yeah.

394
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:09,994
We have a problem.

395
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,888
Stephen is evil.

396
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,648
He mentions your name.

397
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:16,298
He said, "Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe!"

398
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:20,066
It's going to be a big hit 
very soon,

399
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,204
as long as he thinks he has 
the manpower for it.

400
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,793
This morning, Savage told me 
Stephen was after me.

401
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,033
Nothing suprising.

402
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:28,535
He is intelligent.

403
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,612
And I know I'm dangerous.

404
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,948
I knew it would happen.

405
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,108
But I didn't expect it so soon.

406
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,194
Look me in the eyes.

407
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:40,523
From the bottom of my heart, 
on the lives of my children,

408
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,916
I will never write your name.

409
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,351
At this stage,

410
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,063
I trust Savage.

411
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:48,597
I think 
he has my interests at heart.

412
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,891
But if Stephen has gathered 
enough people to take me out,

413
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,707
if I don't win immunity, 
I'm finished.

414
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,179
Over here, everyone!

415
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:17,558
- Ready for the immunity test? 
- Yes !

416
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,233
First of all, Joe, 
I have to take it back.

417
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:22,797
OK my friend.

418
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:31,065
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

419
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,198
Today,

420
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,262
you will 
balance a ball

421
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:36,077
on a disc held by strings.

422
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:40,081
Regularly, you will move 
your hands back on the rope,

423
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,917
increasing the difficulty.

424
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,643
Yes the tombs bales,

425
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:45,749
the test is lost.

426
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,449
The last person standing

427
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:49,382
wins immunity, 
is immune from voting.

428
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:51,017
The losers will go to the council,

429
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:53,895
where someone will be 
the eighth person eliminated

430
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,931
and the second member of our jury.

431
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,233
This event 
has been contested once.

432
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,603
Keith and Jeremy took part. 
Jeremy, were you done...?

433
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:03,696
- Thank you, Jeff. 
- ...Last.

434
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,740
And Keith had won.

435
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,079
An important story 
of 2nd chance, then.

436
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:10,111
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

437
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:21,122
Good.

438
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,191
Everyone 
is in the first position,

439
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,151
and this test is launched.

440
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:26,476
Oh my God !

441
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,155
After a few seconds, 
Wentworth is eliminated,

442
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,233
immediately followed by Ciera.

443
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:35,217
That's how quickly 
your destiny can change in this game.

444
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,530
You have to be constantly vigilant.

445
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,842
And Kelly Wiglesworth loses her ball.

446
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,404
Jeremy fails 
to recover, he is eliminated.

447
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:51,553
Things go fast in this race.

448
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,822
Kimmi's ball is moving, 
can it save her?

449
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,758
Yes, well done.

450
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:02,286
Abi starts rolling...

451
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:04,833
Abi fails to recover, 
she is eliminated.

452
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:07,376
More than seven people.

453
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,699
Fishbach is eliminated.

454
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:15,354
More than six people.

455
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,780
Kimmi's ball is still moving.

456
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:21,801
As soon as said.

457
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:24,270
Suddenly, Savage's ball 
doesn't stay in place.

458
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:26,084
He can't control her.

459
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,614
Savage is eliminated.

460
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:29,439
More than five people.

461
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:36,940
and Kimmi.

462
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,589
This first round 
will last ten minutes.

463
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:43,371
Then we will back up on the rope 
and it will become more difficult.

464
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:50,770
ELAPSED TIME: 
10 Minutes

465
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,848
Everyone moved 
to second position.

466
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,376
Your hands are now 
further back on the rope.

467
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:59,393
Which makes things 
much more difficult.

468
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,115
We'll stay like this for ten minutes

469
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,359
before stepping back further.

470
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:09,965
Kimmi is right on the edge.

471
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,700
A new beautiful recovery,

472
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,025
and one more.

473
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:15,968
Kimmi holds her own

474
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:18,832
and still succeed.

475
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:22,802
Luck turns, 
Kimmi loses her ball.

476
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,013
More than four people.

477
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:35,015
Tasha loses her ball and is eliminated. 
More than three people.

478
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,725
Three men.

479
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:39,543
Joe and Spencer.

480
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:42,664
Keith won the first time,

481
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,224
he would love to put that back on.

482
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,168
Joe and Spencer 
would like to take the win.

483
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:48,852
All three,

484
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,455
keep it up, because it works.

485
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:57,793
ELAPSED TIME: 
20 Minutes

486
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:00,982
Well, everybody's in position,

487
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,393
hands at the end of the rope.

488
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:06,579
We can't go any further.

489
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,922
Keith hopes to retain his title.

490
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:14,597
Joe and Spencer 
hope to whisper it to him.

491
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:19,091
Nothing like wearing this necklace

492
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:21,570
on arriving at the council.

493
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,424
A little movement in Keith.

494
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,375
But a nice recovery.

495
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,675
A little movement in Joe.

496
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:50,775
Spencer is eliminated, 
no immunity for him.

497
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,901
More than two people.

498
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:54,076
It's Keith

499
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,419
against Joe,

500
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,194
for immunity.

501
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:02,016
We'll stay at this section for 
another ten minutes.

502
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:05,614
If you survive it, 
we'll add a 2nd ball.

503
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,889
ELAPSED TIME: 
30 Minutes

504
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:21,429
Keith and Joe each have two bullets 
on their discs.

505
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,390
Unlimited time in this round.

506
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:25,365
We continue until the end.

507
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,350
A little movement 
in Keith, now.

508
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,343
If it was hard with a ball,

509
00:25:33,468 --> 00:25:37,018
with two, it's definitely 
more than twice as hard.

510
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:40,303
If these balls go 
in opposite directions,

511
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:41,524
it went badly.

512
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:44,452
You cannot afford 
any movement.

513
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,280
Keith won it,

514
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:47,822
at the same stage,

515
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,983
the first time, in Blood vs. Water.

516
00:25:52,582 --> 00:25:54,387
Joe's balls 
start moving.

517
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:58,099
A little movement in Keith.

518
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:00,355
A bit of wind.

519
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,856
Joe's balls 
move a little more.

520
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:14,543
The wind begins to pick up, 
causing Joe's balls to move.

521
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,830
He stabilizes once more.

522
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:28,709
Joe's balls 
start moving.

523
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,137
Splendid recovery.

524
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:35,237
The balls are moving again.

525
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,604
Both are moving now.

526
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:50,463
Movement at Keith.

527
00:26:50,588 --> 00:26:51,811
Keith loses his ball!

528
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:56,625
Joe wins 
his second immunity test!

529
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,226
Well done, Keith!

530
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:04,691
Joe, come here!

531
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,368
Well done, Joe!

532
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:07,669
Well done, Joe!

533
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,508
For the second time, immunity.

534
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,557
Only you have worn this necklace.

535
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:14,534
Joe, safe at council tonight.

536
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:16,144
As for you others,

537
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,898
after 21 days,

538
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,338
someone will leave tonight.

539
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:23,536
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council. Congratulation.

540
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,812
Thank god I won immunity.

541
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,403
I know my name 
has been quoted extensively.

542
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:31,651
So let Stephen go, 
because he's the one who mentioned my name.

543
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,283
We have to take it out.

544
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,934
- Well done, Joe! 
- Congratulations, Joe!

545
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,613
You were amazing 
with both balls!

546
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,648
I couldn't 
let Keith fight me.

547
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:55,317
You rocked, man!

548
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:56,976
Not ripped enough.

549
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,354
- Big Joe again. 
-Big Joe!

550
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,091
I'm really frustrated.

551
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:04,826
I've been working to eliminate Joe 
since day 1.

552
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:08,254
And once again, 
he gains that damn immunity.

553
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:11,032
It's like Moby Dick. 
Joe is my white whale.

554
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:12,934
And I am Ahab,

555
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,004
embarked on my mad , single 
-minded quest to eliminate Joe,

556
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,906
and it keeps slipping away from me.

557
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:20,100
What do you have in mind?

558
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,470
Stephen has to go. 
He is really dangerous.

559
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:26,206
I'll talk to Jeremy, so...

560
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:30,076
And I think 
two more are up for it.

561
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:31,252
For sure.

562
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,979
OK. You hold me informed ?

563
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:38,193
Eliminating Stephen 
would be a pretty big blow.

564
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,629
But for me, it's pretty simple.

565
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:42,489
Stephen mentioned my name.

566
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:44,457
So we have to get rid of him.

567
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:48,454
And I'm going to use 
the three girls at the bottom of the ladder to do this.

568
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,645
It's an important vote.

569
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,417
but there is a cool thing to do.

570
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:03,118
Savage wants Stephen out.

571
00:29:03,937 --> 00:29:06,354
Today ?! No kidding !

572
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,655
And it's great.

573
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,891
- It's fantastic. 
- It's fantastic.

574
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,228
- Lord, you are a real demon! 
- Yes.

575
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:16,565
Ciera, Abi and I 
are at the bottom of the ladder.

576
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,491
I thought I was completely screwed.

577
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:21,469
And all of a sudden, Joe says to me:

578
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:24,174
"We're going to take Fishbach out by surprise."

579
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,841
I went, "Fantastic! I love it!"

580
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,192
I write this name.

581
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:29,836
- Come what may ? 
- Yes.

582
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:31,980
So that's what I will do. Fish.

583
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:33,622
It is enormous.

584
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:35,675
And that's true. I have an idol.

585
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:39,087
But I don't want to use it so soon 
if I can avoid it.

586
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:41,848
- This has to stay between us. 
- Wooden cross, iron cross.

587
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:44,926
Fishbach. Completely by surprise.

588
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,330
Joe said 
he would write "Fish" tonight.

589
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,300
- Wigles said the same thing. 
- Very well, I vote Fishbach.

590
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:56,371
At this point, I'm okay 
as long as it's not you or me.

591
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:58,840
- I'll be silent as a grave. 
- Me too.

592
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:01,177
Good job.

593
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:09,435
Stephen is really dangerous.

594
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,021
He still pretends to 
be all in with the Bayon

595
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,781
and all that, but not at all.

596
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:16,958
I know he's up to something big.

597
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:19,552
We have to separate from him.

598
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,722
- What's new ? 
- What's new ?

599
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:25,600
Do we agree 
or are we still talking?

600
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,349
It's Fishbach.

601
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:29,195
- Is that the plan?! 
- Yeah.

602
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,536
Stephen brings up the name Joe.

603
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:32,941
He is dangerous.

604
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:38,580
Now he wants to take Stephen out, 
as he is trying to take out Joe.

605
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:40,573
But that would be bad for me.

606
00:30:40,698 --> 00:30:43,845
Stephen has been with me for 20 days.

607
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,120
We learned to trust each other.

608
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:49,696
I want Stephen 
to accompany me far in this game.

609
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:52,219
'Cause when the big guys 
start killing each other,

610
00:30:52,344 --> 00:30:53,987
I want to have all the ammunition.

611
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:55,730
He prides himself on being

612
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,957
Survivor's greatest strategist.

613
00:30:58,082 --> 00:31:00,320
I know, I understand you 100%.

614
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:01,695
But here's the thing.

615
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,774
I don't want to 
let these girls go on.

616
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:07,834
I tell myself...

617
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,799
We know what he wants to do.

618
00:31:09,924 --> 00:31:12,214
And he won't be 
able to do it

619
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:14,783
- without our cooperation. 
- True.

620
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:17,510
I tell myself that we must leave Wentworth

621
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:18,872
or Ciera.

622
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:22,340
We get another one out, 
and then we can start...

623
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,826
Degrease on our side.

624
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,753
Your arguments are solid.

625
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,212
I will follow the group.

626
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:32,117
As a lawyer, 
I pleaded my case.

627
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:34,982
I'm used to getting 
what I want. But not there.

628
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:36,329
I'm disappointed,

629
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,440
but Jeremy is not wrong.

630
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,333
These two girls are dangerous.

631
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:42,435
We just have to determine

632
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,196
which will leave tonight.

633
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:50,485
What's going on ? 
It runs all over the place.

634
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:52,494
We don't trust Stephen.

635
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,035
But we don't wanna take it out

636
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,225
and create a division so soon.

637
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,861
Damn it !

638
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:01,730
It makes me nervous.

639
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,256
I was saying to myself.

640
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,440
It will be Stephen,

641
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:07,202
I'll just reconfirm 
with everyone."

642
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:08,473
But apparently,

643
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:10,764
Stephen has more connections 
than I thought.

644
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,489
What is being said?

645
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,064
No good.

646
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:15,744
No Stephen?

647
00:32:16,177 --> 00:32:17,916
Savage was in.

648
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,099
Someone has deeper ties to Fishbach.

649
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:22,308
Exactly.

650
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,778
So who is it, Wentworth or me?

651
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:26,446
It's me, huh?

652
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:29,400
I do not know yet.

653
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,158
Wait a minute, we're going to eliminate Fishbach.

654
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,762
The next moment,

655
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:35,750
the plan falls apart.

656
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,557
Joe has no balls.

657
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:39,434
He is dead to me.

658
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:43,672
But the good thing about the council 
is that nothing is certain until the end.

659
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,508
I'm so sick 
of their bogus plans.

660
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,176
So who are you voting for?

661
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:51,130
Would it make a difference to you, 
whether it's Fishbach or Savage?

662
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:53,499
We should all vote 
for the same person.

663
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:55,624
- I say the same. 
- Let's decide.

664
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:59,321
I urged people 
to wake up and play,

665
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:01,781
but I play with people 
who don't want to act.

666
00:33:01,906 --> 00:33:03,216
So at this point,

667
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:05,293
I fear for my life.

668
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:08,430
I'm hoping for a miracle on the council, 
ideally.

669
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:28,697
Here is now 
the first member of the jury.

670
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:34,389
Kass, eliminated at the last council.

671
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,628
Let's pick up where we left off

672
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:41,287
at the last tip, Ciera.

673
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:43,656
You thought 
people weren't playing.

674
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,771
Has this theme continued 
beyond consulting?

675
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:49,337
Yes. Nothing has changed.

676
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:52,040
Nobody fights 
for their place at the top.

677
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,708
It's frustrating.

678
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:58,304
I will say it clearly. 
Four people control the game.

679
00:33:58,429 --> 00:33:59,529
Everything is here.

680
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,455
So we're going to leave 
one after the other,

681
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,628
and that's all.

682
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:05,754
But if they are only four,

683
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,781
that leaves eight more people

684
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:10,350
who should be able to swallow them.

685
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:13,228
We could believe it. 
But no one wants to act.

686
00:34:13,478 --> 00:34:15,955
Ciera, if you want 
people to take action, do it!

687
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,824
Do you know who the four are?

688
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:20,402
Yes, Jeff. 
The four are: Jeremy,

689
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:24,664
Stephen or Joe.

690
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:27,667
- Who is it ? 
- You or me, apparently.

691
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:30,812
Jeremy, there's 
a recurring group of names,

692
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:33,248
systematically referred 
to as being the core.

693
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:34,540
And you are.

694
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:37,252
Yes, but she claims 
that 4 people have control,

695
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:39,486
and she pulled out five names.

696
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,681
They don't even know 
who's in control.

697
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:43,191
But, Joe,

698
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:46,094
it doesn't matter if something 
is true or not.

699
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,930
Only what people believe matters.

700
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:50,690
Perception is truth.

701
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:54,236
So the only security guarantee 
in this game,

702
00:34:54,486 --> 00:34:55,937
this is it.

703
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,231
Savage, you were also quoted

704
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:00,008
as a core member.

705
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,643
What does it do,

706
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,601
to hear his name mentioned?

707
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,681
Yes, we are a handful who 
often talk,

708
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:09,242
we respect each other.

709
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,238
And there are a few other people 
on the same level as us.

710
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:14,014
We decide as a group.

711
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:16,238
- Ciera. 
- Who can swallow that?!

712
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:19,085
In an alliance, someone 
is at the top and someone is at the bottom.

713
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,287
Clearly there are people 
playing here.

714
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:24,199
They play well enough to be 
able to say:

715
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:28,470
"We are allies, all equal.", 
and let everyone believe it!

716
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:30,166
They just have more power.

717
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:33,008
I'm frustrated with those 
who can't see

718
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,570
and hear what they say,

719
00:35:34,695 --> 00:35:37,312
say to themselves that they are not at the top, 
but do not act.

720
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:39,005
It's time to wake up!

721
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,617
We don't just 
have former players,

722
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:44,321
but people who have had time

723
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:46,980
to think about how to react 
in such and such a situation.

724
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:50,125
So what Ciera says 
might be true.

725
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,185
What Ciera says 
is probably true.

726
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,329
With former players

727
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:56,398
maybe they are just waiting

728
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:58,733
someone change sides,

729
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:01,166
or that an idol is played. 
We haven't seen any.

730
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,712
Spencer, let's talk about idols.

731
00:36:02,837 --> 00:36:04,864
The two times 
we brought them up in the council,

732
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:07,609
it was as if no 
one had been looking for them.

733
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:09,402
Is this still the case ?

734
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:11,646
I believe most people think

735
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:14,908
either there are no idols 
or they have been found

736
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,883
and waiting to be played.

737
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:21,656
Savage, what do you think 
of the call to make a big hit

738
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,058
launched by Ciera?

739
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,451
It's fascinating.

740
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,191
I think she can do that,

741
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:29,889
for she is not in the covenant, 
but at the bottom of the ladder.

742
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:33,001
If she was in the place 
of such and such another,

743
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:34,471
she wouldn't say that.

744
00:36:34,596 --> 00:36:38,206
You act like I want 
something crazy to happen.

745
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:40,779
I'm not asking for anything weird,

746
00:36:40,904 --> 00:36:43,403
but that you defend 
your place in the game.

747
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:45,338
I don't find it that big.

748
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:47,682
For me, there is no 
bottom of the scale...

749
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:48,950
Obviously !

750
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:51,386
The way it plays out this season

751
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:54,865
differs from the previous 30 seasons, 
which we have all studied and watched.

752
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,750
We mixed up 
a dozen times,

753
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,360
we all play hard

754
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:00,362
there is no 
usual hierarchy.

755
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:01,588
It's different.

756
00:37:01,713 --> 00:37:03,848
But some things 
will never change.

757
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:07,435
In an alliance, someone 
is at the top and someone is at the bottom.

758
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:10,147
Some of you know you're 
not in the foursome

759
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,198
and do nothing to fix it.

760
00:37:12,323 --> 00:37:14,009
That's what frustrates me.

761
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:17,137
Wentworth, 
what's going to happen tonight?

762
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:20,970
Abi, Ciera and I 
are clearly at the bottom of the scale.

763
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:23,552
So it looks like the easy vote

764
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:25,345
would be one of us. But...

765
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:28,336
Someone 
approached me today

766
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:30,216
and told me he wanted to take action.

767
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:31,551
And not the other way around.

768
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:34,132
So you're saying 
they're not so tight-knit,

769
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:36,094
- because you were approached. 
- Exactly.

770
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,992
It's not me at the bottom of the ladder 
trying to make a big move.

771
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:41,703
They came to see me for this purpose.

772
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:43,838
Why not reveal who,

773
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:45,999
if you are really 
at the bottom of the scale

774
00:37:46,124 --> 00:37:47,374
and desperate?

775
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:50,745
What if I'm here tomorrow, 
having to collaborate with?

776
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:52,881
Damn it, Joe, it's hard!

777
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:55,508
Wherever you look, 
there is an obstacle!

778
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:59,187
It's like playing chess 
without knowing which piece is which.

779
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:00,755
It's trying,

780
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,015
that's exciting.

781
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,040
I expected no less.

782
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:06,419
Good.

783
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:08,396
Let's see what it will give.

784
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:09,945
It's time to vote.

785
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,570
Wiglesworth, over.

786
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:36,591
I would have tried the same thing 
if I were in your place.

787
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,679
Fortunately, I am not.

788
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,046
I will count the votes.

789
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,347
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

790
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,026
now is the time to do it.

791
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:28,510
You know what, Jeff?

792
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:32,305
I may be all the way down, 
but not ready to go.

793
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,673
Oh my God !

794
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,109
It's not true !

795
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:39,079
- You did not know ? 
- Nope !

796
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:41,769
- I had no idea. 
- This is my favorite moment!

797
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:43,083
Oh my God !

798
00:39:48,621 --> 00:39:49,656
Oh my God !

799
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,066
I like this !

800
00:39:57,255 --> 00:40:00,308
This is a hidden immunity idol.

801
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:03,712
Votes against Wentworth 
will not count.

802
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:08,483
I will read the votes.

803
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:10,877
First vote:

804
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:14,289
Wentworth. It won't count.

805
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:18,526
Wentworth. It won't count.

806
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:22,722
Wentworth. It won't count.

807
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:26,368
Wentworth. It won't count.

808
00:40:28,146 --> 00:40:30,038
Wentworth. It won't count.

809
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:31,531
It's funny.

810
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:34,734
Wentworth. It won't count.

811
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:39,172
Wentworth. It won't count.

812
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:43,316
It won't count.

813
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,545
Wentworth.

814
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,813
It won't count.

815
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:53,628
Yeah, my girl!

816
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:57,490
Unbelievable.

817
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:01,294
Eighth person eliminated 
and second member of the jury...

818
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:02,820
Savage.

819
00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:05,153
Two is enough. 
Bring me your torch.

820
00:41:05,278 --> 00:41:06,505
Unbelievable.

821
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,644
Shit.

822
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:09,703
I am loyal to my allies.

823
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:10,879
I like you.

824
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:20,647
- Wow ! 
- Savage,

825
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,123
the tribe has spoken.

826
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:27,528
It's time to go.

827
00:41:29,172 --> 00:41:30,690
You have reached the jury!

828
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,860
Oh ! You too!

829
00:41:38,423 --> 00:41:41,009
This evening, the dominant question 
was to know

830
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:44,479
when someone was going to make 
a big hit.

831
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:46,653
Turns out it was tonight.

832
00:41:46,778 --> 00:41:48,608
Take your torches, 
return to camp.

833
00:41:48,733 --> 00:41:49,783
Good night.

836
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,863
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

837
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:05,697
Next time in Survivor...

838
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:07,227
We have to find that idol.

839
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:09,857
All are looking 
for an advantage in the game.

840
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:11,306
I do not know where he is.

841
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:12,999
But what they don't know

842
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:14,976
it's just in front of them.

843
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:18,346
I will give you the opportunity 
to change your situation.

844
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:22,384
The first person to touch their buoy 
gains an advantage.

845
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,055
It's... mind-boggling.

846
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,531
No one saw it coming.

847
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:33,797
Except Wentworth, but... 
Devil take me!

848
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:35,170
I did things

849
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:37,160
that I hadn't done 
12 years ago.

850
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:38,939
I proved, at least I believe it,

851
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:41,371
that I could compete 
with incredible Survivors.

852
00:42:41,496 --> 00:42:44,278
I played pretty well 
strategically.

853
00:42:44,403 --> 00:42:46,162
Except two minutes ago.

854
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,234
I won't lie, 
it's heartbreaking.
