UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION.

IF YOU GO TOO LOW, YOUR FLAG
WILL POP.

IF GUTOO HIGH, YOUR URN WILL
DROP.

00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,088
>> AURORA WINS IMMUNITY, WHICH
IS FRUSTRATING, BECAUSE PEOPLE

176
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,799
DON'T WANT HER IN THE GAME
ANYMORE, BUT THERE ARE OTHER

177
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,551
OPTIONS ON THE TABLE.

178
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,804
>> THE SHIX SHOULD HAVE A
POWWOW.

179
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,596
>> LET'S DO THAT.

180
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,350
>> I THINK THE SIX ARE STAYING
WRONG.

181
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,269
ESSENTIALLY THERE ARE FOUR
PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE.

182
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,106
WITH AURORA WINNING, YOU HAVE
DAVID, DEVENS, OR VICTORIA.

183
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,942
IT'S LIKE WHEN WHICHONE DO YOU
TAKE OUT NOW?

184
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,820
>> THIS IS A GROUP OF SIX SO I
THINK WE NEED TO COME TO A GROUP

185
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,821
DECISION.

186
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,615
>> WHAT IF WE SNUCK ATTACK AND
TAKE OUT DAVID NOW.

187
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,325
>> ALL OF US ARE VOTING DAVID.

188
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,828
>> I WANTED DAVID OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE

189
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,831
HE'S A RETURNING PLAYER AND A
HUGE STRATEGIC THREAT.

190
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,082
>> OH, MY GOD.

191
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:48,004
>> IF WE DON'T GET HIM OUT NOW,
HE'S GOING GOING TO WALTZ HIS

192
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,213
WAY TO THE END OF THE GAME.

193
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,174
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO WILL GET US TO TRY TO START

194
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,135
TURNING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND
WE DON'T NEED THAT.

195
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:59,849
>> MY PLAN TO TAKE OUT MY
NEMESIS IN THIS GAME, DAVID

196
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,684
WRIGHT, HAPPENS TONIGHT.

197
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,146
I NEVER WORKED WITH RON OR JULIA
EVER ON ANY VOTE.

198
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:10,901
AND IN A SENIOR WHERE WE'VE HAD
FIVE MAJOR BLINDSIDES, YOU CAN

199
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,654
NEVER SAY, "OH, YEAH, I'VE SAFE
TONIGHT.

200
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,824
>> WELL, THEN THERE WERE TWO.

201
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,328
>> THAT LESU THREE WAS GOING TO
BE GONE RIGHT AWAY, AND THEY

202
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:20,953
KEEP GOING.

203
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,163
>> I THINK WE GO FOR WARDOG.

204
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,832
>> IT'S INSANE THAT WE EVEN HAVE
TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS

205
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,043
BECAUSE THEY'RE A POWER TRIO.

206
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,002
JUST DO THE MATH.

207
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,253
>> YEAH.

208
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,922
>> VICTORIA SEEMS GENUINELY NOT
ON THE OTHER SIDE, DOESN'T SHE?

209
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,382
>> YEAH.

210
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,384
>> I FEEL LIKE VIC IS WITH US.

211
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,555
>> WE NEED TO, LIKE, FIGURE OUT
WHERE RON AND JULIE ARE AT.

212
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,224
AND GET AURORA.

213
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,267
PRAISE JESUS.

214
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,519
>> IT LOOKS LIKE DEVENS OR
MYSELF COULD BE GOING HOME

215
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,357
TONIGHT, BUT I'VE PLAYED
"SURVIVOR" BEFORE, AND I KNOW I

216
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,941
CAN TURN THINGS AROUND FOR
MYSELF.

217
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,777
MAYBE I'M JUST MYOPIC, BUT I
WANT TO VOTE OUT WARDOG.

218
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,864
I KNOW THAT HE DOESN'T WANT ME
IN THIS GAME, AND I HAVE TO GET

219
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,242
HIM BEFORE HE GETS ME.

220
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,410
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL?

221
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,914
>> I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S BEST-CASE SCENARIO FOR

222
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:05,539
ME.

223
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,248
>> THERE'S 10 OF US, RIGHT?

224
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,375
>> 10.

225
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,921
>> IF YOU, AURORA, JULIE, RON,
DAVID AND I COME TOGETHER.

226
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,755
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING.

227
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,422
>> WE RUN THE GAME.

228
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,716
>> THAT WAS MY IDEAL SCENARIO.

229
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,928
SO I'M GLAD THAT YOU JUST
COUNTED IT OFF.

230
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,638
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE
AMAZING.

231
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,889
>> YEAH.

232
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,265
AT THIS POINT, I FEEL LIKE I'M
ON THE BOTTOM, SO DEFINITELY IF

233
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,477
I CAN GET OUT OF THAT ROLE, I'M
GOING TO.

234
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,895
AND THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE PLAN
THAT COULD WORK.

235
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,607
>> HAVE YOU ALREADY MADE UP YOUR
MIND, LIKE, WHAT YOU'RE DOING

236
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,525
TONIGHT?

237
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,442
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT IT IS.

238
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,568
>> I HAVEN'T.

239
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:34,860
OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE TWO MAIN
SIDES STILL.

240
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,694
>> YEAH.

241
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,447
>> WHO-- OKAY, WHO WOULD YOU
WANT OUT?

242
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:43,452
>> I THINK IT'S ONLY SMART TO
GET RID OF SOMEONE IN THE POWER

243
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:43,786
TRIO.

244
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,453
>> YEAH.

245
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,414
>> I WOULD PREFER WARDOG FIRST.

246
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,833
AND THEN I DON'T CARE WHAT THE
ORDER IS.

247
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:54,296
>> MY LONG GAME DOES NOT INCLUDE
THREE LESU MEMBERS.

248
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,299
IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THE
LESU THREE ARE CONTROLLING THE

249
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,008
GAME.

250
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,635
AND THEY ARE NOT TALKING TO ME.

251
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,806
SO EVEN THOUGH I NEVER THOUGHT I
WOULD WORK WITH DEVENS AND

252
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:09,478
DAVID, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER
OPTION RIGHT NOW.

253
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,315
>> IT'S BEEN VERY ROUGH FOR YOU
THESE LAST FEW DAYS, I KNOW, SO

254
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,444
I DON'T TO BUT PUTT ANY, LIKE,
UNNECESSARY PRESSURE ON YOU.

255
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,280
BUT, LIKE, PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO
PRESERVE THE POWER TRIO.

256
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,990
THEY'RE SKATING THROUGH THIS
GAME TO THE VERY END, AND

257
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,159
EVERYONE IS LETTING THEM DO IT.

258
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,034
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

259
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,163
>> SO WHO'S YOUR PERSON TO VOTE
OUT?

260
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:27,997
>> WARDOG.

261
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,499
>> I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE
NUMBERS.

262
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,375
>> WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

263
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,002
>> BUT--
>> IF YOU AND RON COME ON BOARD

264
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,878
WITH US.

265
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,964
NOT TO PULL THIS CARD--
>> NO, PLEASE, DO.

266
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:41,135
>> BUT I'VE PLAYED "SURVIVOR"
BEFORE, AND THERE'S ALWAYS THAT

267
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,179
ONE CONVERSATION AFTER THE GAME
SOEVER YOU THINK ABOUT AND I

268
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,973
WONDER, "WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS
OTHER THING?"

269
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:46,974
AND THAT'S THIS CONVERSATION.

270
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,184
>> I'M VERY NERVOUS.

271
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,145
RON AND I FORMED A SIX-PERSON
ALLIANCE WITH THE LESU THREE,

272
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,691
WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF I'M 100%
COMMITTED TO RIGHT NOW.

273
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,526
WARDOG'S DICTATING WHO IS GOING
HOME TONIGHT.

274
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,028
THAT DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH ME.

275
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:06,577
AND NOW I'M WONDERING IF RON AND
I ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

276
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,998
RICK AND DAVID, THEY WERE
TALKING ABOUT A FINAL SIX OF YOU

277
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,210
AND ME AND VICTORIA AND AURORA.

278
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,379
SO I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN A
POSITION NOW KIND OF IN THE

279
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,425
MIDDLE WHERE WE COULD DECIDE
WHICH FINAL SIX DO WE WANT TO GO

280
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,676
WITH.

281
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,221
>> RIGHT NOW, I'M FEELING PRETTY
GOOD WITH WARDOG, LAUREN, AND

282
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:25,554
KELLEY.

283
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,805
>> RIGHT.

284
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,392
MY ONLY FEAR IS, AGAIN, THE TWO
OF US WILL END UP ON THE BOTTOM.

285
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,645
>> TWO DAYS ANOTHER I WAS IN
TROUBLE.

286
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,357
BUT NOW I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO
ALLIANCES, AND BOTH ARE TRYING

287
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,566
TO GAIN MY FAVOR.

288
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,737
ON THE ONE HAND, I THINK WARDOG
AND HIS ALLIANCE OF SIX COULD

289
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,905
WORK.

290
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,948
BUT PROBLEM IS I THINK WARDOG
WOULD KIN IF HE GETS TO THE

291
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,075
FINAL THREE.

292
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,535
HE'S PLAYING A REALLY GOOD GAME.

293
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,246
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T
TRUST DAVID.

294
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,956
HE'S SNEAKY.

295
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,293
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO
GET IN BED WITH DAVID OR WARDOG.

296
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,755
>> US IN THE FINAL FIVE WITH
THREE OF THEM IS TOO DANGEROUS.

297
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,840
LIKE, I OBVIOUSLY WANT TO WORK
WITH YOU.

298
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,050
LIKE, I'M HOPING YOU WANT TO
WORK WITH ME.

299
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,134
>> OF COURSE.

300
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,137
JEWEL SEMI RIDE OR DIE, AND WE
HAVE THE POWER TONIGHT.

301
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,099
I WISH I COULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT
MORE TIME TO LET IT MARINATE,

302
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,101
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION QUICKLY.

303
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,812
>> WE'RE PRETTY SURE IT'S GOING
TO BE DAVID OR I TONIGHT, AND

304
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,938
THEN YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE IN
THE MINORITY.

305
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,231
YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME, TOO.

306
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,484
AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE ON THE
JURY, AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

307
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,110
DAYS.

308
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,069
>> LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

309
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,946
>> DEVENS AND DAVID'S PITCH
MAKES SENSE TO ME.

310
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,155
BUT RON'S UNSURE.

311
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,117
TOGETHER, WE CAN FLIP THE GAME
ON ITS HEAD, BUT WE HAVE TO BE

312
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,120
ON THE SAME PAGE.

313
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,082
THIS COULD BE OUR MILLION-DOLLAR
DECISION, AND NO MATTER WHAT

314
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:45,134
HAPPENS, I'M READY TO EXPECT,
LIKE, FIREWORKS TONIGHT.

315
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:54,143
HAPPENS, I'M READY TO EXPECT,
LIKE, FIREWORKS TONIGHT.

316
00:14:54,226 --> 00:15:04,445
>> Jeff: I'LL NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

317
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,990
SO, DAVID, AFTER THE LAST
TRIBAL, WHICH STARTED CALM AND

318
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,452
IT ERUPTED, YOU CAN FEEL AN
EMOTIONAL DRAIN ON EVERYBODY?

319
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,661
>> YEAH, YEAH.

320
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,248
I MEAN, EVERYONE WALKED IN WITH
ONE OF TWO PLANS, AND A THIRD

321
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:16,999
PLAN EMERGED.

322
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,125
IT WAS INSANE.

323
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,502
IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S THE
BEGINNING OF THE GAME, BECAUSE

324
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,171
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE I CAN TRUST

325
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,132
AND WORK WITH RIGHT NOW GOING
FORWARD?

326
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,176
>> Jeff: SO, DEVENS, WHEN
YOU'RE JUGGLING ALL OF THESE

327
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:32,181
TEMPORARY RELATIONSHIPS, IS
THERE ALWAYS ONE OR TWO THAT ARE

328
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:32,723
LOCKED IN?

329
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,516
>> YEAH.

330
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,060
LOYALTY AND TRUST IS SO
IMPORTANT IN THIS GAME.

331
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:40,022
AND I DIDN'T COME INTO THE GAME
PLAYING A LOYAL GAME.

332
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,192
I BACKSTABBED CHRIS, AND I GOT
VOTED OUT THE NEXT TROOIBL.

333
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,279
AND WHEN I GOT BACK, I DECIDED
I'M PLAYING A LOYAL GAME.

334
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,198
TONIGHT, DAVID AND I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

335
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,661
WE ASKED FOR HELP, AND WE HOPE
SOMEONE SHOWS UP.

336
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,164
>> Jeff: JULIE, LAST TRIBAL
YOU WERE VOCAL AND LOUD ABOUT

337
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,458
SAYING YOU DID NOT BELIEVE IN
THE PEOPLE YOU HAD BELIEVED IN.

338
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,292

HOW DID THE GAME SHIFT FOR YOU?

341
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,382
>> RON AND I CAME INTO THAT
TRIBAL FEELING LIKE WE WERE ON

342
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,008
THE BOTTOM OF THE ALLIANCE.

343
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,929
I REALIZED, I'M A PASSENGER ON
SOMEONE ELSE'S PLANE, AND I'M

344
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,432
HITTING THE "EJECT" BUTTON RIGHT
NOW, AND I'M SO GLAD THAT I DID.

345
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,644
BECAUSE NOW I FEEL LIKE MAYBE
I'M ON MY OWN LITTLE PLANE RIGHT

346
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,813
NOW, BUT IT'S STILL ME FLYING
THE PLANE.

347
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,691
>> Jeff: SO, DEVENS, IS THIS
THE KIND OF PERSON YOU GO TO,

348
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,193
SOMEONE WHO HAS THEIR OWN
SINGLE-SEATER?

349
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,403
>> ABSOLUTELY.

350
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,239
SOMEONE LIKE JULIE WHO MADE A
BOLD MOVE LAST TIME, YOU GO TO

351
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,910
SAY & SAY, "LET'S MAKE ANOTHER
BOLD MOVE TOGETHER."

352

>> Jeff: WARDOG, YOU DON'T
AGREE?

353

LAUREN, AND WENTWORTH.

354
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,083
WE HAVE VOTED TOGETHER EIGHT
TIMES.

355
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,460
WE DEMONSTRATED LOYALTY MORE
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

356

THAT'S GOING TO BE EASY TO

357

SOMETHING.

359
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,051
YOU DON'T KNOW THE DYNAMIC IN
THE GROUP.

360
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,470
JUST BECAUSE THE THREE OF VUS
VOTED TOGETHER, BECAUSE WE'VE

361
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,641
HAD TO, DIDN DOESN'T MEAN THAT T
GOING TO LAST FOREVER.

00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,062
I FEEL LIKE WARDOG, KELLEY, AND
LAUREN, HAVE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE

364
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,982
DAY ONE, HAVE NEVER DEVIATED ON
A VOTE.

365
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,943
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO SIT NEXT
TO A KAMA, WHEN THEY CAN SIT

366
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:11,447
TOGETHER IN A FINAL THREE,
HAVING ONLY TURNED ON THE EXACT

367
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,241
SAME PEOPLE AND ARGUE THEIR
CASE?

368
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:18,245
BUT NOBODY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL
VOTES IS WILLING TO TAKE THAT

369
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,288
ON.

370
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,248
AND THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THIS
GAME BECAUSE OF IT.

371
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,625
>> Jeff: RON, WHERE ARE YOU IN
THIS?

372
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,629

HARD SELL TO JULIE AND ME.

I DON'T THINK JULIE DOES EITHER.

376
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,261
WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS OVER
WHO WE FEEL HAS TREATED US THE

377
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,473
BEST.

378
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,141
>> WARDOG DID NATO YOU.

379
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,310
>> WARDOG IS VERY AGGRESSIVE.

380
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,979
HE'S VERY AGGRESSIVE AND VOCAL.

381
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,648
>> HEY, MY BRAND, HONESTLY, IS
LOYALTY.

382

NOW!

385

00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,156
"LAUREN, I WILL NOT VOTE FOR
YOU."

TONIGHT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN AN
EASY VOTE OR A HARD VOTE.

398
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,395
THE HARD VOTE SAVES US ALL, AND
PUTS US IN THE BETTER POSITION

399
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,690
TO MAKE IT TO DAY 39 AND MAKE A
CASE FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.

400
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,942
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.

401
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,319

SOME SORT OF ADVANTAGE.

510
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,436
>> WOW!

511
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,481
>> Jeff: DEVENS YOUR ADVANTAGE
IS INSTEAD OF FIVE BECAUSE YOU

512
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,651
ONLY HAVE TO LAND FOUR BALLS.

513
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,276
BIG ADVANTAGE.

514
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,735
EVERYBODY TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

YOUR JOB IS TO TRY TO FINESSE
THAT BALL DOWN THE PADDLE AND

00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,315
LAND IT IN A DIMPLE.

525
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,317
THOSE ARE VERY SHALLOW DIMPLES.

526
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,819
IT TAKES A NICE TOUCH.

527
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:16,616
THERE ARE FIVE BALLS AND FIVE
DIMPLES.

528
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,371
DEVDEVENS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF O
NEEDING TO LAND FOUR BALLS.

529
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:21,830
DEVENS IS CLOSE TO LANDING THAT
FIRST BALL.

530
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,831
YOU'LL KNOW IT.

531
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:30,839

00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,947
DEVENS WITH HIS SECOND BALL OUT
THERE NOW.

542
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,033
DEVENS LANDS HIS SECOND BALL.

543
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:02,746
IT IS DEVENS IN THE LEAD, AND
DEVENS ONLY HAS TO LAND FOUR TO

544
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,914
WIN.

545
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,000
AURORA VERY CLOSE.

546
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:07,876

554
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,899
GAVIN DROPS.

555
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,733
WENTWORTH, NO LOVE AT ALL DOWN
ON THE END.

556
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,945
CAN'T GET ANYTHING GOING.

557
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,864
DEVENS HAS HIS THIRD BALL.

558
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:42,410
DEVENS NOW WORKING ON HIS FOURTH

HUGE IMMUNITY ON DAY 27.

DEVENS KNOCKS OFF HIS THIRD BALL
WITH HIS FOURTH.

561
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,963
NOW HE'S GOT TO RELAND THE
THIRD, OPENING THE DOOR FOR

562
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,299
OTHERS.

563
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,427
AURORA HOVERING AROUND THAT
DIMPLE.

564
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,012
AURORA HAS HER THIRD BALL.

565
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:08,103
IT IS AURORA WITH THREE, DEVENS
WORKING ON HIS THIRD.

566
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,730
DEVENS STICKS HIS THIRD BALL
AGAIN.

567
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,941
ONCE AGAIN, DEVENS ON HIS FOURTH
BALL.

568

RON HAS HIS THIRD.

570
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:21,491
AURORA, DEVENS, AND RON EACH
WITH THREE, BUT DEVENS ONLY

571
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,784
NEEDS TO LAND FOUR.

572
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,080
HERE COMES DEVENS TRYING TO BE
NICE AND EASY FOR THE WIN.

573
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,624
DEVENS KNOCKS HIS BALL OUT YET
AGAIN.

574
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,459
NOW HE'S GOT TWO BALLS ON THE
MOVE.

575
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,794
THE CHALLENGE IS WIDE OPEN
AGAIN.

576

BALL LANDED AGAIN.

00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,643
HE'S HAD SEVERAL SHOTS AT THE
WIN.

581
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:51,187
CAN'T DO IT, KEEPS KNOCKING HIS
BALLS OFF.

582
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,939
THAT BALL IS MOVING FAST.

583
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,274
CAN HE SLOW IT DOWN?

584
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,358
HE DOES.

585
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,319
HE'S CLOSE.

586
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:58,945

AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, 27 DAYS

599
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,486
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE 11th
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

600
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,612
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

601
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,696
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:42,697
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,239
CONGRATS.

>> THANK YOU.

605
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,160
>> I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
AURORA'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE I

606
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,579
THINK NOT ONLY IS SHE A
CHALLENGE BEAST, BUT SHE'S

607
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,040
SOMEBODY THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT
TO BRING TO THE END.

608
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,710
LAST TIME SHE WON IMMUNITY, AND
WE COULDN'T VOTE HER OUT.

609
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,046
BUT I AM PRAYING TONIGHT'S OUR
CHANCE.

610
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:15,104
♪ ♪ ♪
>> I COULDN'T EVEN GET ONE.

611
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,065
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU GUYS
WERE DOING IT.

612
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,400
>> I JUST WIN EVERY CHALLENGE
THAT HAS THOSE LITTLE WHITE

613
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,527
BALLS.

614
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,197
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL I LOSE MY
CLOSEST ALLY IN THE GAME.

615
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,533
PEOPLE WERE GETTING BLINDSIDED
LEFT AND RIGHT.

616
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,952
TRIBAL HAS BEEN LIVE SO,
EVERYBODY REALLY WANTS THIS

617
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,745
BABY, INCLUDING ME.

618
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:33,081
AND I'M GLAD I HAVE IT.

619
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,290
THE.

620
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,626
>> THE FACT THAT HE'S GETTING AN
ADVANTAGE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

621
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,293
>> I KNOW.

622
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:37,835
>> DANGEROUS.

623
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,756
>> IT'S A MUTE POINT.

624
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,591
>> AURORA, IT'S AN EASY VOTE.

625
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,218
>> SHE'S TOO GOOD AT THESE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.

626
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,096
>> YEAH, SHE'S TOO GOOD, TOO
GOOD.

627
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,931
I THINK PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE IN A
POSITION OF POWER THEY WANT AN

628
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,767
EASY VOTE, AND THIS ONE LOOKS
LIKE THE MOST EASIEST VOTE.

629
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,104
THE GROUP OF SIX THE TARGET IS
ON AURORA, BUT SHE REALLY HAS NO

630
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,272
TIES IN THIS GAME.

631
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,567
THERE ARE BIGGER THREATS OUT
THERE, SO I THINK IT'S TIME TO

632
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,444
MAKE A MOVE ON THE LAST
RETURNING PLAYER AND THAT'S

633
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:09,617
KELLIE WENTWORTH.

634
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,786
>> WHAT ELSE CAN SHE DO?

635
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:12,787
SHE'S DEAD MAN WALKING.

636
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,955
SHE KNOWS IT.

637
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,957
YOU, ME, AND LAUREN AT THIS
POINT ARE CALLING THE SHOTS.

638
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,587
>> TO MAKE A MOVE LIKE THIS
AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS HE

639
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,130
WELL, SOMEBODY WHO HAS
STRATEGIZED FOR ME FOR 27 DAYS

640
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,633
IN HAD THIS GAME, YOU'VE GOT TO
BE STELL.

641
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,803
SO THIS MORNING, I HAD HAD
30-SECOND CONVERSATIONS WITH

642
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:32,015
AURORA, DEVENS, AND VICTORIA.

643
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:32,432
>> WE'RE DOING IT TONIGHT.

644
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,600
>> DOING WHAT?

645
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,058
>> WENTWORTH.

646
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,268
>> OKAY.

647
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,813
>> I CAN'T REALLY BE CAUGHT
TALKING TO BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT

648
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,357
YOU OUT BUT WE'RE TAKING OUT
KELLEY TONIGHT.

649
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,150
>> OKAY.

650
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,277
>> DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE
NUMBERS?

651
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,902
>> YES.

652
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,279
>> RON, THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

653
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,448
>> OKAY, YEAH, DUDE, MUSIC TO MY
EARS.

654
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,993
>> LOGICALLY I KNEW THEY WOULD
WORK WITH ME.

655
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:57,665
MY PLAN STILL REQUIRES ONE MAJOR
CONVINCING.

656
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,167
SMALL CONCERN, RIGHT?

657
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,209
>> OKAY.

658
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,170
>> WE CAN'T LET A RETURNER GET
TO THE FINAL THREE.

659
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,547
>> RIGHT.

660
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,673
TOO GOOD OF A STORY.

661
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,635
>> TOOFGD A STORY.

662
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,888
COACH WENT TO SECOND.

663
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,056
ROB WON HIS SEASON.

664
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,392
WE'RE ALL SUPERFANS.

665
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,895
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

666
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,188
WHY CAN'T WE TAKE HER OUT
TONIGHT?

667
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,230
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE WHEN I'M
HEARING RIGHT NOW.

668
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,400
WARDOG IS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, I
THINK IT'S KELLEY.

669
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,693
WE'VE GOT TO GET HER TODAY.

670
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,030
WE'VE GOT TO GET HER OUT!"
HE IS SO UNPREDICTABLE, AND THAT

671
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,239
SCARES ME.

672
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,826
KELLEY IS DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST
THREAT, BUT EVERYONE LEFT IN

673
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,038
THIS GAME, BUT IF ANYONE GOES
HOME TONIGHT BUT AURORA, JULIE'S

674
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,081
GOING TO BE FURIOUS.

675
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:43,127
AND SO I'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT THAT DECISION.

676
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,546
>> IT'S TOO EASY, ISN'T IT?

677
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,800
>> SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S TOO EASY
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS THAT THERE'S

678
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,468
SOME OTHER PLAN IN PLAY.

679
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,260
>> AGREED.

680
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:51,594
AGREED.

681
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,679
>> BUT...

682
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,055
>> IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO JUMP
SHIP AT THIS POINT.

683
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,517
I'VE ALWAYS HAD TO BE THE
SCRAPPY UNDERDOG, AND SO NOW

684
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,104
THAT I'M IN A MAJORITY ALLIANCE,
IT IS NICE BECAUSE THERE IS JUST

685
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,273
THIS KIND OF CALM.

686
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,568
BUT, ALL IT TAKES IS ONE PERSON
TO BE LIKE, "IT'S TIME TO GET

687
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,071
OUT WENTWORTH," AND THEY COULD
TRY AND MAKE A MOVE AGAINST ME.

688
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:14,117
SO I'M JUST SO GLAD I HAVE THE
SAFETY OF A HID HADDEN IMMUNITY

689
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,122
IDOL RIGHT NOW.

690
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,374
>> DO YOU REALLY THINK HE'S
DOING IT?

691
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:21,916
>> I DO.

692
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,210
I THINK HE'S WORRIED.

693
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,921
THAT HE'D LOSE NUMBERS IF HE
WAITS TOO LONG.

694
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:32,427
>> TONIGHT, EITHER I'M GOING TO
BE BLINDSIDED BECAUSE YET AGAIN,

695
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:37,348
I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD A POINTLESS
LIE, OR KELLEY'S GOING HOME, BUT

696
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:45,314
I WAS GIVEN AN EXTRA VOTE FROM
SOMEONE ON THE EDGE OF

697
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,277
EXTINCTION, AND COULD I MAYBE
USE THAT TO TRY TO GATHER FAVOR?

698
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,949
ABSOLUTELY.

699
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:58,911
>> AND I REALLY WANT TO VOTE
WITH YOU.

700
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,665
IF I GIVE YOU MY ADVANTAGE, AND
I GET VOTED OUT, IT'S YOURS.

701
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,626
I'D LIKE IF I COME BACK IN, THAT
YOU GIVE IT BACK, AND IT'S OURS

702
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,544
FOR US.

703
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,005
>> I WILL HOLD IT AND HAND IT
BACK TO YOU.

704
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:09,839
>> OKAY.

705
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,466
AND IF NOT, GOOD LUCK IN THE
GAME, BRO.

706
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,509
>> OKAY.

707
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,512
>> RIGHT BEFORE WE LEAVE FOR
TRIBAL, AURORA GIVES ME HER

708
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,640
EXTRA VOTE, AND INSTANTLY MY
MIND GOES TO A DARK PLACE.

709
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,935
I COULD VOTE HER OUT AND IF I
WRITE DOWN HER NAME, SHE'S GONE,

710
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,437
AND I KEEP THIS VOTE FOR MYSELF.

711
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,646
SO TONIGHT I HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

712
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,817
I CAN WORK WITH MY ORIGINAL
ALLIANCE TO VOTE OUT AURORA...

713
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,943
>> SHE'S GOT TO GO.

714
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,945
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M
SAYING?

715
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,113
>> YUP.

716
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,158
OR I CAN GO AND WORK WITH
WARDOG, AND THE THREE WHO ARE ON

717
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,620
THE OUTS, TO VOTE OUT KELLEY
WENTWORTH.

718
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,622
I LOVE BEING IN THE MIDDLE AND
BEING THE DECISION MAKER.

719
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,373
BUT I'VE GOT QUITE A DILEMMA.

720
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,459
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I MAKE THE
RIGHT CALL.

721
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,336
BECAUSE IT COULD BE THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOSING OR

722
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,215
WINNING A MILLION DOLLARS

723
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:07,939
♪ ♪ ♪
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

724
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:15,404
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

725
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,160
>> Jeff: SO, DEVENS, WHEN YOU
LOOK AT WHOSE HAPPENED SO FAR IN

726
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,080
THE GAME, VERY FEW PEOPLE
SITTING OVER THERE ON THE JURY

727
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,750
WOULD SAY, "YEAH, I KNEW IT WAS
COMING."

728
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,920
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S YOU THAT
IS ABOUT TO BE BLINDSIDED?

729
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,923
>> WHEN IT'S YOU THAT'S BEING
TRICKED, I THINK EVERYTHING

730
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,508
COMES A LITTLE TOO EASY.

731
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,844
WHEN EVERYTHING FALLS INTO PLACE
SO PERFECTLY FOR YOU, I THINK

732
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,680
WITH THIS GROUP, THIS SEASON,
YOU HAVE TO STEP BACK AND GO,

733
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:44,058
"WHAT AM I MISSING HERE?"
>> Jeff: VICTORIA, HOW DO YOU

734
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,727
KNOW IF YOU WERE IN ON THE
CONVERSATIONS?

735
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,897
>> I MEAN, I'VE BEEN IN ON VERY
LITTLE CONVERSATIONS INDEPENDENT

736
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,107
PAST FEW DAYS.

737
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,027
THERE WAS ONE THING THAT I'VE
BEEN TOLD, BUT SINCE DEVENS WON

738
00:35:55,111 --> 00:36:00,074
IMMUNITY TODAY, ME AND AURORA
SEEM TO BE LEFT AS OPTIONS.

739
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,243
>> Jeff: AURORA, THIS IS NOT
THE FIRST TIME YOUR NAME HAS

740
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,411
COME UP AT TRIBAL.

741
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,413
>> IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT'S COME
UP WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE THE

742
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,205
NECKLACE.

743
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,373
BUT THERE'S STILL OPTIONS OUT
THERE.

744
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:11,085
I HAVE TO JUST TAKE ALL THE
INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME AND

745
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:12,587
TRY AND FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH.

746
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,257
>> Jeff: RON, THERE'S AN IDEA
WHEN HAD YOU PLAY A GAME LIKE

747
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,593
"SURVIVOR" THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE
YOUR VERY BEST MOVE ON THE

748
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,263
ASSUMPTION THAT ALL THE OTHER
PLAYERS ARE ALSO MAKING THEIR

749
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,472
VERY BEST MOVE.

750
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,434
>> YEAH, IT MAKES SENSE, BUT
ONCE A GROUP OF PEOPLE TASTE OF

751
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,477
BLOOD OF A BLINDSIDE, THEY
BECOME ADDICTED AND THEY WANT

752
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:34,233
MORE OF IT, SO THAT'S WHY THE
PAST FEW DAYS WE PUT A LOT OF

753
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,736
EFFORT INTO SLID FOOG A GROUP OF
PEOPLE WHO WON'T HAVE TO WORRY

754
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,945
ABOUT BLINDSIDES.

755
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,656
>> Jeff: WENTWORTH, DOES THAT
RING TRUE, THERE IS SOMETHING

756
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,409
ABOUT THE BLINDSIDE THAT COULD
POTENTIALLY CLOUD THE GAME

757
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,953
BECAUSE YOU JUST WANT ANOTHER
BLINDSIDE!

758
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,163
<i>( LAUGHTER )</i>
>> YEAH.

759
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,957
WHEN YOU'RE PART OF A BLINDSIDE,
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE PART OF

760
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,292
SOMETHING THE OTHER PEOPLE
WEREN'T A PART OF.

761
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,129
SO I THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
BLINDSIDES ARE NECESSARY, BUT A

762
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:58,841
BLINDSIDE EVERY TIME ISN'T
ALWAYS THE RIGHT DECISION.

763
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,508
>> Jeff: WARDOG, DO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT?

764
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,094
>> I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT.

765
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,930
LAST TRIBAL WAS NOT A BLINDSIDE.

766
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,348
DAVID FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE, AND
THAT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION, AND

767
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:09,185
HOPEFULLY MORE RIGHT DECISIONS
ARE MADE OVER THESE NEXT FEW

768
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,394
TRIBALS AS WELL.

769
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,647
>> Jeff: SO, VICTORIA, 27 DAYS
IN, IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING THE

770
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,023
LOVE AT CAMP, WHAT DO YOU DO?

771
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,485
>> ALL THE TIME THINGS FLIP ON
THEIR HEAD.

772
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,446
THE SMALLER THE NUMBERS GET, THE
LESS STRONG SOME ALLIANCES THAT

773
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,281
HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE
WILL BECOME.

774
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,700
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST GO WITH
WHO YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

775
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,662
YOU REALLY HAVE TO START
THINKING WHO DO I WANT TO SIT

776
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,205
WITH AT THE END OF THIS GAME?

777
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,458
IN THAT SENSE, THERE ARE A LOT
MORE SCARY PEOPLE LEFT IN THIS

778
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,210
GAME THAN ME.

779
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,338
>> Jeff: SO, WENTWORTH, WHEN
IS THE RIGHT TIME TO START

780
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,382
THINKING ABOUT WHO DO YOU WANT
TO SIT NEXT TO AT THE END?

781
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,300
>> THAT'S A TRICKY QUESTION.

782
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,510
I THINK PEOPLE ARE THINKING
TOWARDS THE END GAME BUT YOU

783
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,180
ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO YOU
CAN TRUST BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T

784
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,808
TRUST PEOPLE GETTING THERE, YOU
MAY NOT GET THERE AT ALL.

785
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,687
>> Jeff: DEVENS, THERE HAS
BEEN ONE ADVANTAGE PLAYED IN THE

786
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,482
GAME BY YOU, AND THERE HAS BEEN
ONE IDOL, ALSO PLAYED BY YOU.

787
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,358
>> YEAH.

788
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,527
>> Jeff: 27 DAYS IN, THAT'S
VERY UNUSUAL.

789
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,406
>> WELL, I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO
THANK THE BEAUTIFUL ANGEL THAT

790
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,368
IS DAVID WRIGHT WHO GAVE ME THAT
ADVANTAGE TODAY.

791
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,414
BUT WE SCOURED EVERY BEACH WE'VE
BEEN TO, AND NO ONE CLAIMS TO

792
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:15,459
HAVE FOUND ANYTHING, SO I THINK
THE GROUP CONSENSUS IS THAT THE

793
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,379
"EDGE OF EXTINCTION" IS WHERE
ADVANTAGES LIE.

794
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,883
>> Jeff: RON, ANYBODY THAT
FEELS ON THE OUTS IS A VOTE TO

795
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,093
BE SCOOPED UP.

796
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:28,389
DO YOU CONSTANTLY SIT BACK AND
ASSESS, "HM, WHO CAN I GET TO

797
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,516
JOIN THE FLOCK?"
>> I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN YOU

798
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,060
HAVE AN ALLIANCE YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH, YOU DON'T WANT

799
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,563
TO DO THAT BECAUSE IF OTHERS SEE
YOU DOING THAT, THEN YOU BECOME

800
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,772
SUSPECT.

801
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,025
AND SO SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PUT
THE PEDAL DOWN, AND SOMETIMES

802
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,028
YOU NEED TO RELAX A BIT BECAUSE
IF YOU'RE TOO AGGRESSIVE, YOU

803
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,738
BECOME A THREAT.

804
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,574
>> Jeff: JULIE, IN TERMS OF A
GAME, PEDAL DOWN OR BACKING OFF?

805
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,076
>> FOR ME, I'M BACK OFF.

806
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,914
I FEEL LIKE TONIGHT WOULD BE A
SAFE AND EASY DECISION TO TRY

807
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:58,044
AND SHAKE THINGS UP AGAIN WOULD
BE LIKE REARRANGING THE

808
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,253
PAINTINGS ON THE "TITANIC."

809
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,755
LIKE, THERE'S NO POINT.

810
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,758
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.

811
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,844
WENTWORTH, YOU'RE UP.

812
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:45,674
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

813
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,595
>> I'M VERY COLD.

814
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,186
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

815
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:10,366
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

816
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,158
OKAY.

817
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,828
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

818
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,292
FIRST VOTE, AURORA.

819
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:29,009
WENTWORTH.

820
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:29,844
AURORA.

821
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,344
AURORA.

822
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:35,349
THREE VOTES AURORA.

823
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:35,933
AURORA.

824
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,184
THAT'S FOUR VOTES AURORA.

825
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,688
ONE VOTE WENTWORTH.

826
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,189
WENTWORTH.

827
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,192
TWO VOTES WENTWORTH.

828
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:45,985
WENTWORTH.

829
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:53,576
THAT'S THREE VOTES WENTWORTH.

830
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,660
WENTWORTH.

831
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,538
WE'RE TIED, FOUR VOTES
WENTWORTH, FOUR VOTES, AURORA.

832
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:04,545
ONE VOTE LEFT.

833
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,548
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

834
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,215
WENTWORTH.

835
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:08,632
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

836
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:14,346
>> WOW, GUYS.

837
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:24,899
A LOT OF LYING GOING ON.

838
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,903
>> Jeff: WENTWORTH, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

839
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,196
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

840
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:30,905
>> GOOD LUCK.

841
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,033
SEE YOU SOON.

PERSON.
