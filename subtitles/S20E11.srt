00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,419
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,420
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,337
With their numbers dwindling,

4
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,422
each of the Villains were

5
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,423
making plans for a possible

6
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,424
merge.

7
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,133
>> If we merge, I have control

8
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,175
of the Villain camp, complete

9
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,469
control.

10
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,470
>> PROBST: Russell thought he

11
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,722
was pulling all the strings, but

12
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,807
Parvati made moves of her own.

13
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,808
>> Another immunity idol is

14
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,976
hidden at your camp.

15
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,769
>> PROBST: She tracked down a

16
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,104
hidden immunity idol, telling

17
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,105
only her friend Danielle.

18
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,106
>> Right now, Russell doesn't

19
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,107
need to know.

20
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,108
>> PROBST: While the outcasts,

21
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,151
Courtney and Sandra, merely

22
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,069
wanted to survive.

23
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,071
>> It's inevitable that me or

24
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,031
Courtney are going home.

25
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:32,574
>> PROBST: The Heroes were

26
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:36,411
equally sure a merge was coming,

27
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,787
and even more sure that Russell

28
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,788
was on the outs with the

29
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,789
Villains.

30
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,874
>> That women's alliance looks

31
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,334
very strong.

32
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,627
>> PROBST: So they came up with

33
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,212
a plan to pull in Russell by

34
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,505
giving him an idol with

35
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,590
instructions to take out

36
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,591
Parvati.

37
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,134
>> This is your chance to show

38
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,135
you're not a Villain.

39
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,344
>> PROBST: At the last immunity

40
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,345
challenge...

41
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,346
>> Done.

42
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,973
>> PROBST: Heroes win immunity!

43
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,433
...the Heroes celebrated another

44
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,269
win as J.T. gave Russell an idol

45
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,312
and a chance to become a hero.

46
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,313
(thunder rumbling)

47
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,983
But Russell's a Villain.

48
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,151
>> You don't hand the enemy the

49
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,903
idol.

50
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:10,445
>> PROBST: In a brilliant

51
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,489
double-cross, Russell kept both

52
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,531
the idol and his ally,

53
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,532
Parvati...

54
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,533
>> Shut up!

55
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,910
>> PROBST: ...as he and his

56
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,078
female accomplices laughed all

57
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,748
the way to Tribal Council, where

58
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,583
they voted out Courtney.

59
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,210
Courtney, the tribe has spoken.

60
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,170
And Sandra was left all alone,

61
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,713
angry at her own tribe.

62
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,424
We are now even-- five Villains,

63
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,425
five Heroes.

64
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,635
With both tribes equal in

65
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,761
number, the real battle is

66
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,303
about to begin.

67
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,889
Who will be voted out tonight

68
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:44,646
in<i> Heroes vs. Villains?</i>

69
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,815
>> Day 25.

70
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,025
Man!

71
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:52,028
>> We need a change.

72
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,363
>> I just want to see Russell

73
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,073
and four girls.

74
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,074
>> Oh.

75
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,827
We seriously better merge today.

76
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,246
>> I mean, it's just, like, "Oh,

77
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,247
day 25."

78
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,456
Something's got to happen, you

79
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,374
know.

80
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,542
Please, give us a merge.

81
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,709
Give us a challenge.

82
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,752
Give us anything.

83
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,337
>> This is exponentially worse

84
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,338
than I ever remember it.

85
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,006
>> I hope we get treemail.

86
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,465
That's all we can do.

87
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,383
>> Us five, the family, have

88
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,468
been together a pretty long

89
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,678
time now.

90
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,930
It's taking its toll on us.

91
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:19,472
>> I hope I'm not pissing

92
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,306
anybody off too much.

93
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,349
>> I think we all are.

94
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,392
>> I try and keep quiet...

95
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,269
>> I'm pretty sure I'm annoying

96
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,270
someone.

97
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,230
>> Oh. Oh, my gosh!

98
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,983
>> What is this?

99
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,150
>> "Heroes..."

100
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:31,734
>> BOTH: "...do not open this

101
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,654
box until you have the key."

102
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,115
>> "Make room in your camp."

103
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:37,657
>> BOTH: "Company will be

104
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,870
arriving soon."

105
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,871
>> Oh, my gosh.

106
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:48,960
>> They're bringing the key.

107
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,088
"Company will be arriving soon."

108
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,340
>> I wonder what that key is to.

109
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,258
>> I know.

110
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,385
>> Oh, I hope it's a treasure.

111
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,386
I do love treasure.

112
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,387
>> A hidden treasure.

113
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,472
>> Oh, we've got something...

114
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,724
>> You guys, it's an Hawaiian

115
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,725
sling...

116
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,726
>> That's a real one.

117
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,768
>> ...with a key on it.

118
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,769
>> With a key.

119
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,770
>> And a note.

120
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,771
>> A key?

121
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,900
>> What is it the key to?

122
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:12,901
>> All right.

123
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:13,902
(overlapping chatter)

124
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,903
>> A map!

125
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,195
>> It's a map to the Heroes'

126
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,196
camp.

127
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,197
>> Get the hell out of here.

128
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,198
Let me see.

129
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,243
>> Oh!

130
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,244
>> Oh, my God!

131
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,245
>> Do we know...?

132
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,246
>> We are merging!

133
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,415
>> Do we know how to...? Okay.

134
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,459
>> We just got treemail, and

135
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,293
it comes with a map to our new

136
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,294
home.

137
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,296
If it is a merge, it's okay with

138
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,465
me, 'cause it's right up my

139
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,466
alley.

140
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,842
We're going over to the Heroes

141
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,260
home turf and weeding them out

142
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,386
one at a time.

143
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,262
We know for a fact that I have

144
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,973
to go to J.T., explain to him

145
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,974
why Parvati's not gone.

146
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,975
>> We are going to go to J.T.

147
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,976
and tell him you used his

148
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,977
idol...

149
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,978
>> Be, like, "Than you."

150
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,979
>> ...to save yourself last

151
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:50,980
night.

152
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,981
"Thank you." You're going to

153
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:52,982
play that.

154
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,983
>> He's going to say, "Why

155
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:54,984
didn't you vote Parvati out?"

156
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,985
What I want to do is say that we

157
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,986
both played an idol at the same

158
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,448
time.

159
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,449
>> Because I thought the girls

160
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,450
were revolting.

161
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,451
>> No.

162
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,452
>> So then when the next time we

163
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,453
go to Tribal, you're going to

164
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,454
tell them that you're voting

165
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,455
with them.

166
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,456
>> Right.

167
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,457
>> And they want Parvati off

168
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,458
first.

169
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,459
>> Yeah.

170
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,460
>> Yeah?

171
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,461
>> So then you're going to use

172
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,045
the idol to save yourself, and

173
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:14,671
then, who's going to go home,

174
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,505
one of them?

175
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,422
>> Yeah, J.T. will go home.

176
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,299
>> Shh. Shh. Quiet.

177
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,634
>> With all the other Heroes, we

178
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,635
do.

179
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,636
>> You know, Sandra's walking

180
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,637
around.

181
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,638
Just be quiet.

182
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,639
>> I know!

183
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,016
>> So be quiet.

184
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,601
>> Right now, I do think I have

185
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,394
the only hidden immunity idol

186
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,646
in pocket.

187
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,064
The people that know about it

188
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,274
are the people that have to

189
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,733
know about it-- my whole tribe,

190
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,401
except for Sandra.

191
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,403
We're not going to tell her

192
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,570

the Villains coming was Parvati.

00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,506
Parvati had to have played an

320
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:52,907
You can see it.

321
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,908
It's like a worm in his skin.

322
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,909
>> If I had that, I think I'd

323
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,910
cut myself.

324
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,911
Had to take it out.

332
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,588

333
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,589
Nothing.

334
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,590
Leave me alone!

335
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,759
No, I don't want to talk.

336
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,761
None of the Heroes are happy

337
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,762
that I'm here.

338
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,305
They wanted to get rid of me

339
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,306
before, and they're probably

340
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:17,890
all be shocked that I'm still

341
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,641
here.

342
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,725
I definitely don't feel like

343
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,144
I'm part of this tribe, so I'm

344
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:22,770
thinking they're going to vote

345
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,772
for me because they want me

346
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,773
gone.

347
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,066
Like, do these people think I'm

348
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,067
stupid?

349
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,068
>> Yeah.

350
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,111
>> Do they think I'm stupid?

351
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,153
Like, Amanda's played with me

352
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,154
before.

353
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,155
>> They think they have the

354
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,156
game right now, and let them

355
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,157
think that.

356
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,158
Just play... play it like...

357
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,159
>> That's what... That's what I

358
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,160
am. I'm, like...

359
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,161
>> Play right into it.

360
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,162
>> That's what I was doing, and

361
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,247
now it's just, like, I'm over

362
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,248
it.

363
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,583
I'm offended by how these Heroes

364
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,002
are treating me.

365
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,129
They don't know it yet, but

366
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,048
they're about to be picked off

367
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,049
one by one.

368
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,050
Don't talk to me.

369
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,051
It'll get you in trouble.

370
00:09:54,135 --> 00:10:06,814
>> No, I won't.

371
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,815
>> You know, this is the first

372
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,816
time I've been comfortable since

373
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,817
day four.

374
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:17,491
>> I imagine so.

375
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,492
>> The hidden immunity idol?

376
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,620
>> When did she use it?

377
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,496
>> We both stood up and looked

378
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,497
at each other.

379
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,498
>> Oh, man.

380
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,499

00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,626
Oh, man.

00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,800
>> So everybody but Courtney.

383
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:35,801
And Courtney voted for Jerri.

384
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,802
Everybody else voted for

385
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,013
Courtney.

386
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:39,680
This is where I stand.

387
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,724
This is it for me.

388
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,725
So don't even have any doubt.

389
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,726
>> I don't doubt you.

390
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,727
I don't doubt you.

391
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,728
>> Don't have any...

392
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,855
Don't even worry.

393
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,276
>> Just let this happen.

394
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,277
>> That's right.

395
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,278
>> Just breathe.

396
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,279
>> Breathe.

397
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,280
>> Breathe.

398
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,281
>> That's exactly right.

399
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,575
>> Yeah.

400
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,583
>> Giving Russell the hidden

401
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,501
immunity idol could blow up in

402
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,085
my face.

403
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,628
I mean, he could have never been

404
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,587
going home.

405
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,880
You know, he could be the leader

406
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,923
of the girls over there.

407
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,924
Do I believe it?

408
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,509
Not a chance in the world.

409
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:16,967
So I mean, I trust him

410
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,928
explicitly.

411
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,016
>> Exactly right.

412
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,396
>> Hook, line, and sinker.

413
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,605
They're biting everything I tell

414
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,065
them.

415
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,608
This is going to be way easier

416
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,485
than I thought.

417
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,861
>> You're darn right.

418
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,280
>> That's right.

419
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,865
>> That's good.

420
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,909
It's going to be a wonderful

421
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,370
thing.

422
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,175
>> You know how some people

423
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,176
forgive but don't forget?

424
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,261
Well, I don't forgive and I

425
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,470
don't forget.

426
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:01,971
The Heroes don't know that

427
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,974
Russell is the kingpin and that

428
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,893
Parvati's his right-hand man.

429
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,270
Russell's trying to play up this

430
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,105
thing like all these women are

431
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,065
about to get rid of him.

432
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,608
I hope I get my revenge 'cause

433
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,318
it's going to be good.

434
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,529
>> So what happened last night?

435
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,530
>> Courtney's the last person

436
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,114
from my alliance.

437
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,198
They didn't want me and Courtney

438
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:21,949
over here together.

439
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,993
That's why Courtney had to go.

440
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm the last one standing and I

441
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,871
have to be babysat, and if they

442
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:32,918
catch me talking, I'm gone next.

443
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,919
You guys are done, starting with

444
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,753
the men.

445
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,297
You better-- I got to-- I got to

446
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,006
keep you on the low-low.

447
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:37,923
I'll tell you on the low-low.

448
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,924
>> Right.

449
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:39,925
Okay.

450
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,635
>> But whatever Russell says,

451
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,928
agree to it, but he's lying if

452
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,221
he says that the women are

453
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,347
running the show.

454
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,348
>> Got you.

455
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,850
Sandra just gave me some really

456
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,768
good information.

457
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:54,190
Russell told us that Parvati

458
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,858
used her immunity idol last

459
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,276
night.

460
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,903
That is not true.

461
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,530
I don't know if we're getting

462
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,033
played or not, but Russell might

463
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,119
be running the show, and if

464
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,996
Sandra is true-- and I have to

465
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,999
believe Sandra-- Russell is

466
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,210
playing us.

467
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,836
Boy.

468
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,880
This is where the game gets

469
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,341
crazy.

470
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,476
>> All right, now scramble that

471
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,060
joker up or them eggs are

472
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,312
gonna be brown on the bottom.

473
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,730
>> Do you guys want your egg

474
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,732
boiled or scrambled?

475
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,816
>> Oh, I don't care.

476
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,109
>> Um, whatever you guys do.

477
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:39,568
>> Okay. Just asked

478
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,778
if you cared.

479
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,237
>> Whatever you have.

480
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,905
Whatever you're inspired to

481
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,864
make, I'll eat it.

482
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:49,620
>> Okay. (both chuckle)

483
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,498
>> The egg is really good.

484
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:52,957
>> That is a damn good

485
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,874
breakfast.

486
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,001
>> Yup.

487
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,462
>> I'm gonna find a banana.

488
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,048
>> Oh, yeah.

489
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,800
>> Oh, my God, it's like

490
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,634
all I need.

491
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,051
You're not hungry?

492
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,595
>> Y'all still got breakfast on

493
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,721
me, don't ya?

494
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,597
>> We just ate.

495
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,056
>> Why do they want to

496
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,683
eat again?

497
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,976
They can't be eating all

498
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,310
their food.

499
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:18,232
>> Look at this one. (chuckles)

500
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:18,983
>> They're the greedy-ass,

501
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:19,942
eating-ass, pain-in-the-ass

502
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,944
tribe.

503
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:26,282
In our Hero tribe, coconuts are

504
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,450
aplenty.

505
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,286
Anyone can open any coconuts

506
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,537
they want.

507
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,247
With the other food: the bananas

508
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,875
the papayas, we divide that up

509
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,045
a hundred-percent even.

510
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,131
I cannot wait to start voting

511
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,757
some of these Villains out of

512
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,217
our camp.

513
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,219
>> That's more than I eat

514
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,763
in three days.

515
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,306
>> I'm already tired of 'em.

516
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,849
>> Not very good.

517
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,474
>> And they've only been here

518
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,517
two days.

519
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,727
>> This one might be.

520
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,021
It's rotten.

521
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,856
>> Alls I'm saying you got

522
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,565
to watch 'em.

523
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,108
You got to watch all of them.

524
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,068
If Russell<i> is</i> playing us...

525
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,778
>> He's not.

526
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,904
>> Now listen to me.

527
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,322
Don't be so quick.

528
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,574
Let me just tell you the

529
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,116
scenario, okay?

530
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,534
If Russell didn't use that damn

531
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,160
immunity idol, and he's got all

532
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,037
of us voting for Parvati, those

533
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,997
four can put one of us out.

534
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,957
>> But I'm telling you Parvati

535
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,751
wouldn't be in this game if she

536
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,668
didn't play her idol.

537
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,127
No question. I asked.

538
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,837
I believe that.

539
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,379
>> I don't think so either.

540
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,214
>> You have faith in Russell.

541
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:24,965
Don't trust him.

542
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,258
He's on the Villain side

543
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,426
for a reason!

544
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,054
J.T. believes wholeheartedly

545
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,388
that Russell is on our side

546
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,600
and indebted to us now.

547
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,851
I don't.

548
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,728
So we might just plan on

549
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,312
changing our five votes just

550
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,189
before we go in there;

551
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:40,981
whoever Russell says.

552
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:41,607
>> Yep.

553
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,232
>> We don't put that person, but

554
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,318
we look right at him and say,

555
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,069
"Okay. Stay the course."

556
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,362
>> Yeah, we will do whatever it

557
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,112
takes, the first vote.

558
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,238
>> We're together to the end,

559
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,073
brother, to the end.

560
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:49,698
>> We're good.

561
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,532
> All right, this is,

562
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,576
this is...

563
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,702
>> Rupert is really skeptical of

564
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,496
Russell, so just to make sure

565
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,955
Rupert's okay, the Heroes are

566
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,040
gonna tell Russell we're voting

567
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,583
for someone, and then the five

568
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,084
of us are gonna vote for

569
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,460
someone else.

570
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,961
So it's good just to test.

571
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,296
We don't want to make a dumb

572
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,756
decision, and then be, you know,

573
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,758
lose our lead.

574
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,926
That would be awful.

575
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,052
You're getting paranoid.

576
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,804
>> You are. You're sweating,

577
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,971
you're scaring yourself into

578
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,389
a panic out here.

579
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,265
You're not pulling...

580
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,934
>> I-I just want to make sure

581
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,227
one of us... Fine.

582
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,270
>> Rupert-- (laughs) there's a

583
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,563
reason that I've been doings a

584
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,106
Rupert strategical play for

585
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,108
him thus far because he needs

586
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,194
to be told where to vote by

587
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,445
someone he can really trust,

588
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,447
and let that be done.

589
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,324
So I just keep reminding him

590
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,575
of that, like, "Rupert, think

591
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,868
"about this a minute.

592
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,454
"Do you believe what Sandra

593
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,123
"told you or do you believe

594
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,874
the obvious truth?

595
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,167
I mean...

596
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,337
>> It's, it's smelling fishy.

597
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,464
>> If Sandra's story turns out

598
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,800
be true, and Russell did not

599
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,969
play the idol, then that means

600
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:52,553
I'm probably going home the

601
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,220
next Tribal Council.

602
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,888
I don't know.

603
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,806
Do I believe it?

604
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,348
Not a chance in the world.

605
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,934
But you never know in this game.

606
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,018
>> Russell looked me right in

607
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,311
the eye and swore on his kid's

608
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,022
life that he was with us.

609
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,275
And anybody that will do that,

610
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,067
right away I don't trust 'em.

611
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,403
>> Okay.

612
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,071
>> Okay, then don't

613
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,866
trust Russell.

614
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,269
>> About you?

615
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,228
>> About you.

616
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,229
>> They're gonna try to

617
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,814
vote me out.

618
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,982
>> Yeah, they want you gone.

619
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,400
Like, that's why I don't know

620
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,943
what to do 'cause it's weird,

621
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:50,319
Parvati.

622
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,111
Like, I have no power over here.

623
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,363
Like, everyone's freaked out

624
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,656
about you.

625
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,493
>> I don't know. I just...

626
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,536
So if I don't win today, then

627
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,370
they're voting for me?

628
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:00,996
>> Probably.

629
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,580
>> And Russell with probably

630
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,248
vote with them.

631
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,086
>> To get with Sandra?

632
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,296
>> Rid of Sandra.

633
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,720
>> Amanda and I got a chance to

634
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,180
talk for the first time sinceto

635
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,933
the merge, and I think I got

636
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:21,433
probably half her story.

637
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,644
So I haven't decided the best

638
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,313
plan yet because with her, I

639
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,981
don't know if she's telling me

640
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,983
the truth or not.

641
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,069
Will you tell me who everyone's

642
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:32,444
voting for?

643
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,070
>> Yeah.

644
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,154
>> Just at least tell me.

645
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:34,488
>> No, I will.

646
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,239
>> Okay. Do you swear you're

647
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,366
gonna be really honest with me?

648
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,367
>> Yes, I have been.

649
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,827
I told you all that stuff.

650
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,578
>> Okay, so then I have to

651
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,621
tell you something.

652
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,457
>> Okay.

653
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,667
>> You have another one?

654
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:46,875
>> Yeah.

655
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,418
>> How did you get another one?

656
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,754
>> I'm crafty. (laughs)

657
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,005
>> Love it. Loving it.

658
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,048
I had a conversation with

659
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,423
Parvati.

660
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,550
I didn't tell her everything,

661
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,217
but I told her enough to get

662
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,845
her to trust me, and she told me

663
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,847
that she had the idol.

664
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,889
And I like Parvati and

665
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,307
everything, but she makes it to

666
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,017
the end of this game, she's

667
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:04,601
gonna win again.

668
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,561
>> If we're working together,

669
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,562
then we're working together

670
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,983
and I trust you.

671
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,192
However the vote shakes down,

672
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,944
I'm gonna make sure my butt is

673
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,237
safe, no matter what.

674
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,239
But I'm gonna try to make it

675
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,324
work that none of our Villains

676
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,535
are going anywhere tonight.

677
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,078
>> But you trust me?

678
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:23,829
>> I trust you.

679
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,496
>> I trust you.

680
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,164
Should we do a secret handshake?

681
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,249
>> Yeah.

682
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,668
>> Blow it up.

683
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,795
(both laugh)

684
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,679
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

685
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,731
You're now merged as one tribe.

686
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,107
What's the new tribe name?

687
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,441
>> Uh, Yin Yang.

688
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,359
It means good and evil.

689
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,195
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

690
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,572
ready to get to your first

691
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,364
individual immunity challenge?

692
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,365
>> Yes.

693
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:00,991
>> Yeah.

694
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:01,867
>> PROBST: All right, first

695
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,451
things first, I will take back

696
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,079
the immunity idol.

697
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,835
Tribal immunity is no more.

698
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,213
Individual immunity is what

699
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,548
you seek.

700
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,883
For today's challenge, it's

701
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,926
very simple.

702
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,719
You will hold onto a pole for as

703
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,888
long as you can.

704
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,514
If you fall off, you're out

705
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,349
of the challenge.

706
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,060
Last person left hanging on

707
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,269
their pole wins immunity,

708
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,606
guaranteed a one-in-nine shot at

709
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,107
winning this game and the

710
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:34,608
million dollars.

711
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,068
Losers, Tribal Council.

712
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,152
Somebody will be going home.

713
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,195
Make sense?

714
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:38,570
>> Yes.

715
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,780
>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots,

716
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,199
we'll get started.

717
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,993
All right, everybody climb up.

718
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,912
take your spots.

719
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,790
>> Oh, here we go.

720
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,250
It's kinda hot up here.

721
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,042
>> Oh, my God.

722
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,293
>> Geez.

723
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,336
>> Oh, my God, this is scary.

724
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,464
>> Oh, my gosh.

725
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,762
>> PROBST: And this challenge

726
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,097
is on.

727
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,724
Everybody finding their spot.

728
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,310
Amanda, Donaldson and Sandra

729
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,397
slowly inching down the post.

730
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,899
Could be a good strategy, could

731
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,943
be a sign they're in trouble.

732
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,529
J.T., Candice and Parvati have

733
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,532
all competed in this challenge

734
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,242
in previous seasons.

735
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,827
None of them have won this

736
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,372
challenge.

737
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,373
>> My leg won't stop shaking.

738
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,542
>> PROBST: Sandra already in

739
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,293
trouble seconds into this

740
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:35,544
challenge.

741
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,255
>> I can't get right.

742
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,256
>> Yeah, I hear ya.

743
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,549
You want to do it at the same

744
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,174
time?

745
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,011
One, two, three.

746
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,637
Donaldson steps down.

747
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,638
(Sandra groans)

748
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,056
Colby-- first person out of

749
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,141
this challenge.

750
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,350
Sandra steps down.

751
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,144
Sandra's now out of the

752
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,271
challenge.

753
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,355
Colby, disappointed how fast

754
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,399
you were out or is something

755
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,025
going on?

756
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:58,608
>> I knew, I knew it was gonna

757
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,568
be quick for me, yeah.

758
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,069
>> PROBST: How come?

759
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:01,570
>> Just based on that last

760
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,487
challenge we did with the

761
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,197
footholds.

762
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,159
Not my forte, that's for sure.

763
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:07,784
>> PROBST: We're down to eight.

764
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,328
We are one minute into this

765
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,496
challenge, and already, people

766
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,623
are struggling.

767
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,253
Rupert adjusting.

768
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:21,465
Very little room for your toes.

769
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,387
Candice, Danielle and Parvati

770
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,431
all look very solid.

771
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,683
Amanda looks very solid,

772
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,226
although she is low on

773
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,519
the post.

774
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,772
Russell trying to get

775
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,399
comfortable.

776
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,777
And Russell steps out of the

777
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,153
challenge.

778
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,654
Take a spot on the bench.

779
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,324
We are down to seven people left

780
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,451
in this challenge.

781
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,578
(Danielle exhales sharply)

782
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,041
(Rupert groans)

783
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,751
Rupert struggling.

784
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,836
Hanging on for dear life.

785
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,462
(Rupert groans)

786
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,923
Rupert is out of the challenge.

787
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:03,507
(Rupert groans)

788
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,300
And we are down to six people

789
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,303
left in this challenge.

790
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,647
(Danielle exhales sharply)

791
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,482
Been up there just over

792
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:26,738
20 minutes.

793
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,406
Amanda steps out of the

794
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,866
challenge.

795
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,202
We are down to five people left

796
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,703
in this challenge.

797
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,455
(J.T. grunts)

798
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,415
>> Ah, you thought I was gone,

799
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:37,874
didn't you?

800
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,792
>> I was, like, "What"?

801
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,543
>> No, I was just getting

802
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,627
a little break.

803
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,088
>> PROBST: J.T., were you just

804
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:43,797
playing around?

805
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,091
>> No, I almost fell.

806
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:58,562
(Jerri, Danielle laugh)

807
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,188
>> PROBST: J.T. readjusting all

808
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,274
over the place now.

809
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,359
(J.T. groans)

810
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:06,945
(J.T. groans)

811
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,488
J.T, drops out of the challenge

812
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:08,864
without warning.

813
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,698
>> Oh, I didn't see!

814
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,492
>> PROBST: We are now down to

815
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,535
four people left in this

816
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,579
challenge, and they are all

817
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,746
women.

818
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,125
Candice the lone remaining Hero.

819
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,559
(Parvati chuckles)

820
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,059
>> Geez, Parvati, how

821
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,312
in the heck are you staying on

822
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,396
like that?

823
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,440
Wow.

824
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,608
(Parvati chuckles)

825
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,236
I think I'm about done.

826
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,447
I can handle the pain,

827
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,781
It's the dehydration.

828
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,324
>> PROBST: Yeah, starting

829
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,491
to get to you?

830
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,868
>> Yeah.

831
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,660
>> PROBST: Jerri moving down to

832
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,288
the lowest foothold.

833
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:58,747
Nowhere else to go.

834
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,833
Arms are shaking, legs

835
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,001
are shaking.

836
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,293
>> Good job.

837
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,669
>> PROBST: Jerri steps out of

838
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,171
the challenge after one hour,

839
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:06,713
30 minutes.

840
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,130
>> Good job, Jerri.

841
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,506
>> Good job, Jerri.

842
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,841
>> The bad thing is we drank

843
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,133
your water.

844
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:10,759
(Jerri laughs)

845
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,886
>> PROBST: We are now down

846
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,346
to three.

847
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,722
Candice and Parvati were in

848
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,807
their own showdown back in

849
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,309
the Cook Islands.

850
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,560
Danielle has never done

851
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,228
this challenge.

852
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:21,811
She's sitting right in between

853
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,563
the two of them.

854
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,106
Now been out here one

855
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,404
hour, 35 minutes.

856
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,366
>> All right, girls, good luck.

857
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,202
>> PROBST: What'd you say,

858
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,203
Candice?

859
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,120
You're stepping down?

860
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:39,955
>> Yeah.

861
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,122
>> PROBST: Wow.

862
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,666
Before you step down, Candice,

863
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,753
I'm curious why in a challenge

864
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,631
for immunity in which of all the

865
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,799
people who've played it, you

866
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,467
lasted the longest.

867
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,386
You're the odds-on favorite

868
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,262
to win.

869
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,680
You're now-- for no reason--

870
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,265
just going to bow out of the

871
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:58,640
challenge.

872
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,308
>> They look like they could go

873
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,477
for a while.

874
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:02,727
It's true.

875
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,730
>> PROBST: Step out.

876
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,482
And with that, Candice steps off

877
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,858
the post and is out of

878
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:09,901
the challenge.

879
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:10,944
>> Good job, Candice.

880
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:11,861
>> Thanks.

881
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,946
>> Good job, Candice.

882
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,364
>> PROBST: And we are now down

883
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:14,739
to two.

884
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,700
All the Heroes are gone.

885
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,575
>> How you doing?

886
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,493
>> I'm cool.

887
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,035
>> You're cool?

888
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,286
>> Yeah.

889
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:19,869
>> PROBST: Two Villains left,

890
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:20,620
and immediately they start

891
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,747
to talk.

892
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,550
>> All right, this one's

893
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,010
all yours.

894
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:35,677
>> PROBST: Parvati appears to be

895
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,805
stepping out of this challenge,

896
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,016
and she does.

897
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,767
And with that, Danielle wins

898
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,103
first individual immunity.

899
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,439
(applause)

900
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,274
(Danielle grunts)

901
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,817
>> Good job, Danielle.

902
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,235
>> Nice, Danielle.

903
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,820
>> Thank you.

904
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,947
Yay!

905
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,199
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

906
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,909
Danielle safe tonight at

907
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,286
Tribal Council.

908
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,829
As for the rest of you, after

909
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,248
27 days, one of you going

910
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:05,790
home tonight.

911
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,250
You have the afternoon to figure

912
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,293
out who it's gonna be.

913
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,210
Head back to camp.

914
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,503
I'll see you at Tribal.

915
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,546
Congratulations.

916
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,088
>> Yes!

917
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,882
>> I think Parvati is gonna come

918
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,300
up with a hidden immunity idol

919
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,259
tonight.

920
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,802
But Parvati wouldn't have walked

921
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,888
off that pole, but I don't know.

922
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,556
That's all part of the plan

923
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,141
tonight; to see if I can oust

924
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,518
Russell for the weasel that

925
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,811
he is.

926
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,622
>> It's kinda strange how

927
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,247
Parvati stepped down at the end

928
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,707
of the challenge, you know?

929
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,417
And she's in such danger and she

930
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,419
knows it.

931
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:51,920
So the plans are, tonight,

932
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,921
the Heroes are gonna

933
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,090
let Russell write Parvati's name

934
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,841
down just to prove his loyalty

935
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,052
to all of of us.

936
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,678
Me and Candice and Rupert,

937
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,391
Amanda, Colby-- five strong--

938
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,934
will write down Sandra or

939
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:13,274
Jerri's name.

940
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,946
>> Right, yeah.

941
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,571
>> Sandra?

942
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,366
Jerri done a hell of a lot

943
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:31,084
better than Sandra did.

944
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,252
>> I don't even care

945
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:32,794
who goes home.

946
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,295
>> I don't either as long as

947
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,004
it's not me.

948
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,589
>> As long as it ain't us.

949
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,966
When we come back tonight,

950
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,551
they'll be real mad, like, "What

951
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,135
in the hell just happened?"

952
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,803
>> They think that they got this

953
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,595
in the bag.

954
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,179
Which tells me that Russell's

955
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,265
doing a good job of convincing

956
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,143
them.

957
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,811
>> When I first got here, I

958
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,229
tried to tell Rupert that

959
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,564
Russell is running this

960
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,231
whole show.

961
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,732
And anyway, we talked really,

962
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,903
really quick, and that was it.

963
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,698
I don't want my big mouth

964
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,616
to get me in trouble.

965
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,494
I still want Russell out bad.

966
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,996
But right now I'm stuck

967
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,291
with Russell.

968
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,626
I'm stuck with Russell.

969
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,927
>> My plan A is to give the idol

970
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,012
to Parvati, save herself,

971
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,138
and vote out J.T.

972
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,182
I don't have a plan B.

973
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,850
But I hope for the second time

974
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,477
I'm gonna save her with a

975
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,144
immunity idol.

976
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,896
I have a gift for you.

977
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,022
If it was just me, it'd be just

978
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,691
me, but I got to keep these

979
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,818
four girls on my Villain tribe

980
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,904
so I can get rid of J.T.

981
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,697
>> Oh, you!

982
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,657
You shouldn't have!

983
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,409
>> There you go.

984
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,619
(Parvati laughs)

985
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,287
Thanks, honey. (chuckles)

986
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:49,829
Russell just gave me his

987
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,247
immunity idol.

988
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,790
So that makes me safe for

989
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,792
for tonight.

990
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,212
And I have my own immunity

991
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,216
idol.

992
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,884
That also makes me safe

993
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,885
for the rest of the game.

994
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,137
It's like two little green men

995
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,805
protecting me.

996
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,557
And apparently everyone else

997
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,850
in this game is, like, desperate

998
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,310
to get rid of me.

999
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,019
And they said that I'm the most

1000
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:13,978
dangerous player out here.

1001
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,855
So I don't know.

1002
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:16,898
I guess they're right.

1003
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,483
I didn't really think they were

1004
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,651
right until right now.

1005
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,902
Now I really think they're

1006
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:31,788
right. (chuckles)

1007
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,331
>> What? Being on

1008
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,541
separate tribes?

1009
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,166
>> Yeah.

1010
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,501
>> I know.

1011
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,794
>> Because I honestly don't know

1012
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,419
what to do.

1013
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,255
I want to play with you, but I

1014
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,548
don't see how we're gonna

1015
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,924
play together.

1016
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,260
So the idea is to have

1017
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,178
Parvati play her idol and

1018
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,096
vote out Sandra or Jerri.

1019
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,223
It'll be really crazy tonight if

1020
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,474
Parvati gives her idol to

1021
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:51,933
to somebody.

1022
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,392
I hope she doesn't.

1023
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,477
I hope she plays it for herself

1024
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,479
just so...

1025
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,814
I mean, it's always good.

1026
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:58,439
You never want idols floating

1027
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,149
around.

1028
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,235
It just ruins things.

1029
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,404
She's so dangerous.

1030
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:04,946
>> I just want to make sure

1031
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,116
it's not me that goes.

1032
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,621
Really?

1033
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,208
>> Just play it.

1034
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,711
>> Okay.

1035
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,507
I knew that Amanda was lying to

1036
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,925
me when she told me that they

1037
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:26,342
were voting for me.

1038
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,344
Like, I know you're trying to

1039
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:28,928
get rid of me, but I'll just

1040
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,139
play along with you right now.

1041
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,432
It's, like, "Thanks for looking

1042
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:32,974
"out for me (clicks tongue)

1043
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,184
buddy."

1044
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,728
>> Just to be safe.

1045
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,855
>> Okay.

1046
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,567
>> But, like...

1047
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,861
>> I just, I don't know what to

1048
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,486
do because I'm really honestly,

1049
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,280
Parvati, I'm so confused, like.

1050
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,907
>> It's gonna get messy,

1051
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,992
so I think the best thing that

1052
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,244
you could do tonight is just

1053
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,163
let them vote for me, and just

1054
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:55,538
vote with them.

1055
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,707
Then we'll take it from there.

1056
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,126
>> All right. (sighs)

1057
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,420
My head hurts.

1058
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,096
>> It's hard to really know who

1059
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,890
they're voting for.

1060
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,058
If they say they're voting me

1061
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,851
out, and I play the idol, then

1062
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:19,062
the idol's gone, and it's

1063
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,230
just risky.

1064
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,733
So damned if you do,

1065
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,692
damned if you don't.

1066
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,193
Unless, like, you picked

1067
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,986
the right person.

1068
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,280
I hope.

1069
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,422
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1070
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,468
the members of our jury.

1071
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,095
Coach and Courtney voted out

1072
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,764
at the last Tribal Council.

1073
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,140
>> Whoo-hoo!

1074
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,356
>> PROBST: Rupert, what is camp

1075
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,023
life like, both Heroes and

1076
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,150
Villains living in the

1077
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,402
same spot?

1078
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,195
>> (laughs): It is...

1079
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,321
an adjustment.

1080
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,906
You know, you heard James say

1081
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:12,532
the "banana etiquette" thing.

1082
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,450
I haven't had a ripe banana

1083
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,285
since... (laughs)

1084
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,161
since they got here.

1085
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,038
>> With all due respect,

1086
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,416
there's so many plantains and

1087
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,835
green bananas that I don't

1088
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,919
think we should be penalized

1089
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,754
for wanting to cook a plantain,

1090
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,172
considering the plethora amount

1091
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,174
that we have.

1092
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,509
>> I don't think there's ever

1093
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,927
been a discussion about eating

1094
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,803
plantains.

1095
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,264
We have a thousand plantains.

1096
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,224
It's the ripe<i> bananas.</i>

1097
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,935
We have ripe bananas all the

1098
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:44,105
time, but we let them ripen.

1099
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,481
>> But I always feel like I'm

1100
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,941
walking on eggshells around the

1101
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,317
camp, because you guys do things

1102
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,694
your way, we've done them our

1103
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,820
way, and now we've come

1104
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,446
together, so we need to work out

1105
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,238
a way where it works for

1106
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,823
everybody.

1107
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,074
>> I think... I think that, uh,

1108
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,034
nothing's going to change.

1109
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,786
There's two separate tribes.

1110
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,371
The game is on.

1111
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,706
Let's forget about the green

1112
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,999
bananas and the yellow bananas

1113
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,459
or whatever-- so what?

1114
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,335
Let's play the game.

1115
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,462
>> PROBST: Russell, could

1116
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,921
tonight's vote dictate the rest

1117
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:09,839
of the game?

1118
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,674
>> Tonight's vote<i> will</i> dictate

1119
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,842
the rest of the game.

1120
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,218
This is the most important vote

1121
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,429
that I've ever been a part of.

1122
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,221
If one of the Villains go home,

1123
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,474
then the Heroes are going to be

1124
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,516
in the top five.

1125
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,142
If one of the Heroes go home,

1126
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,226
the Villains are going to be in

1127
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,936
the top five.

1128
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,896
That's just how it's going to

1129
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:25,605
work tonight.

1130
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,856
That's going to happen.

1131
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,483
>> PROBST: J.T., sound true to

1132
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,150
you?

1133
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,234
>> I hope that it's true, and I

1134
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,445
hope it's a Villain that goes

1135
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,196
home, if it is.

1136
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,781
>> PROBST: Was it a crazy day at

1137
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,032
camp, J.T.?

1138
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,200
>> None of these people want to

1139
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,326
talk to me, so that leads me to

1140
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,410
believe my name's getting

1141
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,411
wrote down a lot tonight.

1142
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,579
>> I'll talk to you anytime,

1143
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,205
J.T.

1144
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,414
>> My feelings are already hurt.

1145
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,540
I don't want to hear it.

1146
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,085
>> Aw! Maybe mine are hurt, too.

1147
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,668
>> PROBST: Jerri, can you see

1148
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,837
what J.T.'s talking about,

1149
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,338
that you guys were somehow

1150
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,131
avoiding him for some reason?

1151
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,299
>> It did feel a little bit

1152
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,009
like they had a wall up, J.T.

1153
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,302
in particular.

1154
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,303
>> Russell, is that maybe just

1155
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,597
paranoia, that everybody's

1156
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,973
feeling the same thing?

1157
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:01,557
>> I think that that's exactly

1158
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,226
what it is, paranoia.

1159
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,019
You know, I talk to J.T. all the

1160
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:05,478
time, all the time.

1161
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,480
I've probably been talking to

1162
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,607
their tribe more than mine.

1163
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,610
>> PROBST: Sandra, concern you a

1164
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,361
little, Russell, your Villain

1165
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,030
tribe mate, is over there making

1166
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,531
friends with the Heroes?

1167
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,616
>> No. I mean, we all want

1168
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,408
to get along.

1169
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,868
I mean, I talk to everyone

1170
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,245
individually, "Hey, how you

1171
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,246
doing, where you from, where

1172
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,081
you work," whatever, but as far

1173
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,374
as strategy, nobody said

1174
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,542
nothing to me neither, so I

1175
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,668
didn't say nothing to them

1176
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,794
neither.

1177
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:30,378
>> I feel like everyone's been

1178
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,212
avoiding<i> me.</i>

1179
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,548
(laughs): I feel like a leper on

1180
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,757
this tribe. I do.

1181
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,341
>> PROBST: But is that just

1182
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,217
because you're used to getting

1183
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,386
attention all the time in life?

1184
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,220
(laughter)

1185
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,722
>> No, Jeff, but you're right.

1186
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,723
But no.

1187
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,726
I think... I think it's because

1188
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,144
everyone thinks I'm such a

1189
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,688
threat, and so no one wants to

1190
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,147
be associated with me.

1191
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:50,731
>> PROBST: So you believe the

1192
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,609
Heroes have you in their sights

1193
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,485
tonight?

1194
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,361
>> Definitely.

1195
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,279
>> Or maybe we haven't

1196
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,990
approached Parvati yet because

1197
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,949
we know she's going to be

1198
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:00,575
around for a few more days and

1199
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,326
we'll have that opportunity.

1200
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,619
So there's another angle.

1201
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,079
>> So in other words, the

1202
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,122
Heroes might be targeting

1203
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,748
somebody else on the Villains.

1204
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,418
>> Maybe.

1205
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,170
>> J.T., has there been any

1206
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,255
talk in your group about who

1207
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,464
might have any hidden immunity

1208
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,924
idols, if there are any in the

1209
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,717
game at all?

1210
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,176
>> The idols are a big topic of

1211
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,887
conversation.

1212
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,305
It's a mess, and I don't have

1213
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,181
any idea who might have an idol

1214
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:24,599
or who's got one.

1215
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,392
I know I don't have one, so I'm

1216
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,270
pretty worried about it.

1217
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,563
>> PROBST: Parvati, topic of

1218
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,939
discussion on the Villains'

1219
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,107
tribe?

1220
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,066
>> Yeah, definitely.

1221
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,568
I mean, we've seen what idols

1222
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,444
can do, as far as on the

1223
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,361
Villain tribe.

1224
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,989
It broke a completely solid

1225
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,407
alliance and turned the game.

1226
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,367
>> PROBST: Well, I don't think

1227
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,285
we've had a bigger vote.

1228
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,411
Danielle, you have the immunity

1229
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,287
necklace.

1230
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,246
I assume you're keeping it

1231
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,247
tonight.

1232
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,248
>> Of course.

1233
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,374
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1234
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,000
Danielle.

1235
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,335
Everybody else is fair game.

1236
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,128
It is time to vote.

1237
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,255
Russell, you're up.

1238
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,515
>> You seem like a real cool

1239
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,351
guy, but it was a real dumb

1240
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,312
move by giving me your idol.

1241
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,897
And because of that, I gotta

1242
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,024
vote you out tonight.

1243
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,032
>> This is my love letter to

1244
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,783
you.

1245
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:24,408
Since you tried to vote me out,

1246
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,535
I figured I should return the

1247
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,663
favor.

1248
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,923
>> Hoping my name doesn't come

1249
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,050
up tonight.

1250
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,144
>> I hope Parvati plays that

1251
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,646
idol and shows everybody that

1252
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,773
Russell is a liar.

1253
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,159
>> Jerri, we're voting for you

1254
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,036
tonight because if there is an

1255
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,662
immunity idol, you're the least

1256
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,622
likely person that they would

1257
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,749
give it to.

1258
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:17,712
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1259
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,547
votes.

1260
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,728
If anybody has a hidden immunity

1261
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,062
idol and you want to play it,

1262
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,816
now would be the time to do so.

1263
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,446
>> You know what, Jeff?

1264
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,572
(others groaning)

1265
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,741
I think it would be downright

1266
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,451
depressing to sit and watch

1267
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,785
green bananas turn yellow

1268
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,578
without my debaucherous little

1269
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,999
Villains, so...

1270
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,209
Sandra, that's for you.

1271
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,586
>> Get out of here! For real?

1272
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,713
>> Yeah.

1273
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,386
And, Jeff...

1274
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,596
I would just like to increase

1275
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,598
our odds.

1276
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,226
So, Jerri, that one's for you,

1277
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:25,404
too.

1278
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,114
>> PROBST: Thanks, Jerri,

1279
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:27,990
Sandra.

1280
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:32,536
>> Wow!

1281
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,829
>> PROBST: The rules of<i> Survivor</i>

1282
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,997
state that if anybody plays a

1283
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:35,623
hidden immunity idol, then any

1284
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,875
votes cast against that person

1285
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,126
will not count.

1286
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,461
These are both hidden immunity

1287
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,046
idols.

1288
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,422
Any votes cast for Sandra or

1289
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,592
Jerri will not count.

1290
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:53,432
I'll read the votes.

1291
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,519
First vote...

1292
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:56,727
Jerri.

1293
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,562
Does not count.

1294
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,653
Jerri.

1295
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,780
Does not count.

1296
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,616
Jerri.

1297
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,743
Does not count.

1298
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:15,788
Jerri.

1299
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:19,708
Does not count.

1300
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,501
Jerri.

1301
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,628
Does not count.

1302
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:26,674
J.T.

1303
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,801
One vote J.T.

1304
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,724
J.T.

1305
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,852
That's two votes J.T.

1306
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,982
11th person voted out and the

1307
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,942
third member of our jury...

1308
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:45,609
J.T.

1309
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,986
That's three, and tonight

1310
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,113
that's enough.

1311
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,622
J.T., the tribe has spoken.

1312
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,208
Time for you to go.

1313
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,419
>> Good luck, fellas.

1314
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,177
>> PROBST: Well, in a game full

1315
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,637
of crazy moves, that was one of

1316
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,889
the craziest.

1317
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,265
With tonight's vote, it

1318
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:16,807
certainly appears that the

1319
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,684
Villains have the upper hand,

1320
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,643
but you know better than

1321
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,562
anybody-- anything can and

1322
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,730
probably will still happen in

1323
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,731
this game.

1324
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,732
Grab your torches.

1325
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,733
Head back to camp.

1326
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,611
Good night.

1327
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:41,999
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1328
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,126
from our next episode.

1329
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:48,214
>> PROBST: Next time on

1330
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,006
<i>Survivor...</i>

1331
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,049
>> Whatever, whatever.

1332
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,258
>> PROBST: As Russell loses

1333
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:51,800
control of his alliance...

1334
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,510
>> You lied to me.

1335
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,011
>> How did I lie to you?

1336
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:54,720
>> PROBST: ... Sandra takes

1337
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,555
control of the game.

1338
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:56,931
>> They're done.

1339
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,598
So you want Russell gone?

1340
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,391
>> Yeah.

1341
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,184
>> Russell's gone.

1342
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:00,643
My target is Russell.

1343
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,895
I've been waiting to take him

1344
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,313
down for 30 days.

1345
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,272
>> Yeah, I trust you.

1346
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,399
(Sandra laughs)

1347
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,821
>> I feel like a total idiot

1348
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,739
right now.

1349
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,407
It's pretty terrible to be

1350
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,992
voted out by your own idol.

1351
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,410
I felt like Russell would vote

1352
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:18,953
the way we told him to vote.

1353
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,704
People are Villains for a

1354
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,082
reason-- don't ever trust them.

1355
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,583
Worse than that, don't ever

1356
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,835
trust women, ever, ever, ever.

1357
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,045
You can't always win.

1358
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,505
It was a big move, do or die,

1359
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,632
and I died tonight.
