1
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:04,471
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,760
At the Naviti,

3
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,771
it was the war 
between Chris and Domenick.

4
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:12,246
Between these two, it does not pass.

5
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:15,346
And the original 
Navitis were tearing each other apart.

6
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:18,846
My family slit my throat. 
All three of us voted for me.

7
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,871
Clearly, 
they were aiming at me through you.

8
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:25,104
The Malolos were preparing for the council.

9
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:28,046
And the ex-Naviti were united

10
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,646
against Jenna, Michael and Stephanie.

11
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,830
Fortunately, we have the majority.

12
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:35,771
We have control and we lead the dance.

13
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,971
At the council, 
the Naviti alliance remained united...

14
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:42,888
Stephanie, the tribe has spoken.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,271
...leaving Michael and Jenna 
on their own.

16
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:51,871
There are 15 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

17
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:06,627
Over here, everyone!

18
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:17,056
Naviti, 
discover the new Malolo tribe.

19
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,471
Stephanie was eliminated 
at the last council.

20
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:29,401
Good. 
Naviti string together victories,

21
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:31,504
Malolo the defeats.

22
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:33,778
Let's see what will happen now.

23
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:36,712
Throw away all your bandanas!

24
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,071
We change the tribes.

25
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:42,641
Throw them away !

26
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:46,371
Bon sang!

27
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:50,246
Michael, how are you feeling?

28
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,258
You chained defeats.

29
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:55,271
It's never good, 
regardless of alliances.

30
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:59,246
From a game perspective, 
it might save my life.

31
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:03,046
We, the Malolos, were in the minority 
since the first mix.

32
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:05,530
Now that things 
are changing again,

33
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:09,271
maybe there is hope 
for Jenna and me.

34
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:13,312
James, what's going on now, 
game-wise?

35
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:16,460
Well we all survived

36
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:18,873
to the so-called 
first phase of the game.

37
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,394
Now it's a race 
towards fusion and beyond.

38
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:27,342
This day can be decisive 
for everyone's strategy.

39
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,569
Alright, shall we go? 
Yes.

40
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,646
We do not have a choice.

41
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:33,094
New bandannas.

42
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:35,371
Don't open, wait for my signal.

43
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:40,806
Why, Jeff? Why do that ?

44
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:43,846
Depending on what I'm shooting, 
I can be in trouble.

45
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:46,946
So I pray 
that fate will play its part

46
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:49,415
and protect me. 
Fate is my buddy.

47
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:50,752
This is my prayer.

48
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,149
Last one for you, Domenick.

49
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:59,304
Good. Everyone 
unpack their bandana.

50
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,546
Let's see which tribes you are in.

51
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:03,546
Please... 
Malolo.

52
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,371
Yes Naviti!

53
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:08,027
And you will quickly discover...

54
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:10,071
... a third color. 
Green ?!

55
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,698
We go from two tribes...

56
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:15,571
... to three tribes.

57
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,189
If you have purple: 
purple carpet.

58
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:21,413
Orange: orange carpet. 
Green: in the center.

59
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:23,571
Do you have purple?

60
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,471
Hi. 
It's booming?

61
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:28,246
Delighted. 
Likewise.

62
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:30,671
Ma petite!

63
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:34,971
I was told about the legendary Sebastian.

64
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,596
Thin. Good luck to you.

65
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:40,599
That rascal Chris 
was always after me.

66
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:42,768
Getting away from him is a relief.

67
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:45,049
For the first time, I have my hand.

68
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:47,376
I can decide 
the direction of the game.

69
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,371
Wow. That's a mix!

70
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:55,638
There are three original Naviti 
and two original Malolo

71
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:58,271
in each of the three Tirbus.

72
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,148
Bradley, at this point 
it's really hard

73
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:03,546
to rely on purple or orange.

74
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,678
'Cause there's now been enough 
interconnection between people

75
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:10,746
so that we no longer know 
where is placed who.

76
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:14,608
For me, it remains: do the 
original divisions persist?

77
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:17,146
Or are there new things? 
I do not know.

78
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:21,206
I am delighted to discover it, 
to see where everyone is.

79
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:23,672
Donathan, is this good for you?

80
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,146
Bad ?

81
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,646
Neutral ? 
No idea !

82
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:33,205
I do not know these two, 
I am delighted to discover them.

83
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:37,346
We have three Naviti 2.0s 
and two original Malolos.

84
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:39,273
Will they stay together?

85
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:42,846
Libby and I have sex?

86
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,863
I do not know.

87
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:48,991
Sebastian, one thing goes 
with a new tribe:

88
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,046
a new beach. No shelter.

89
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,546
Yes, we have to start from scratch.

90
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:56,608
But we have strength at hand.

91
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,870
It won't be a problem, Jeff.

92
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:02,904
It's a fact: in Survivor, 
it's at pivotal moments

93
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:07,346
let the strong players shine 
and the weak fade.

94
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,632
And whatever you feel 
right now,

95
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:13,246
your chances of going all the way, 
with 15 people still in play,

96
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:17,371
are better than at the beginning of the game. 
Hold on to that!

97
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:21,271
A brand new start 
in Survivor Ghost Island.

98
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,840
Yanuya is your name.

99
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,939
Here is a map leading to your camp.

100
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:30,471
Follow the beach. 
Good luck with the new shelter!

101
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,879
Naviti, Malolo, 
get your stuff, back to camp.

102
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:35,971
The game has changed again.

103
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,824
I was hoping for a better mix.

104
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:43,589
But even if I remain in the minority, 
it may be a new start.

105
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:47,971
I have to make the most of this 
opportunity, and that's my intention.

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,202
Damn, yeah! 
Sweet hearth!

107
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,975
Rice ! 
Yeah !

108
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,473
The fishing kit! 
We are never going to lose.

109
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:08,376
We have skills 
in all categories.

110
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,374
I want to talk to you. 
I moved.

111
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,351
We're going to talk about furnishings.

112
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,000
It shakes a little 
to have to start from scratch.

113
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,675
But I was in a tribe 
chaining defeats.

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,790
I want to know the victory, 
the pleasure of having to eat,

115
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,839
not to go to every board.

116
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:28,102
It comes at the right time, 
I'm excited.

117
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:30,588
Sea bass, I have something for you.

118
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,700
Stopped ! Did you save it?!

119
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,400
Thank you my brother ! 
I knew we would meet again.

120
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,907
My shell. 
He schlings.

121
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:41,600
He is perfect.

122
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,775
I found him when he was alive.

123
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,986
I like to collect memories.

124
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,274
That's why 
I still have these necklaces.

125
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:52,375
I kept this seashell 
found on the old Naviti camp.

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,749
Wendell had the heart 
to bring it this far,

127
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,292
her bag smelling of dead shellfish.

128
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:02,129
Wendell, I love you. 
No problem. It was written !

129
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,228
I spent little time with Wendell

130
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:08,800
because he was friends with Domenick 
and I worked with Chris.

131
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:12,200
He's the buddy 
who was never my buddy.

132
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:16,043
But he knows who I am and 
we barely know each other. Pretty cool.

133
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,675
Ready to merge? 
Yeah, all right!

134
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,775
I'm glad we left.

135
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,675
You were seeing the wrong person 
at the wrong time.

136
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,875
I know it. It's a new day.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,124
I was more than ready 
to throw off my bandana.

138
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:34,900
Because I found myself trying 
to manage two oversized egos,

139
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:39,446
Domenick and Chris, 
who each want to kill the other.

140
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:43,206
And even if I'm a little sad 
not to have my friend Dom anymore,

141
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,775
I was excited 
to be with Chris again.

142
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,312
He is an outstanding sportsman 
with a terrible track record here.

143
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:55,383
Now 
listen to Chris boast,

144
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,086
I don't like bragging and boasting at all.

145
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:02,275
Laurel, do you play volleyball? 
Yes, I did.

146
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,875
I played beach volleyball. 
To see you, I'm not surprised.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,426
I did too. 
Really ?

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,865
I played it in Cocoa Beach, actually.

149
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,775
Oh? 
Two years ago.

150
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,075
That's where I was playing.

151
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,041
I played in Chicago once. 
Our team won the tournament.

152
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:21,375
When you are a great 
charismatic sportsman like me,

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,575
No lie, it's exhausting.

154
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,986
Some may settle down 
and let the game evolve.

155
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,153
Me, I have to anticipate, 
develop such and such a link,

156
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,223
because I've had an "X" on my back 
since day one.

157
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,082
I see myself as an entrepreneur,

158
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:42,313
even if I currently have 
few investments in progress.

159
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,575
I invest in myself.

160
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,475
I can see you 
giving motivational seminars.

161
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,005
It's hard not to answer Chris.

162
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,275
He likes to listen to himself talk.

163
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,885
But I've been through 
different situations

164
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,100
and have always managed 
to adapt, to get along with everyone.

165
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:03,117
I have this ability to adapt 
to the people around me,

166
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,086
to be what they need.

167
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,275
I'm also a model, actually.

168
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,599
Model ? 
I didn't tell anyone.

169
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:12,375
In fact, I told Libby 
I had been.

170
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,080
But you continue? 
Yes.

171
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,918
I hesitate to call myself a model because...

172
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:20,901
For some crazy reason,

173
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:25,339
people see models 
as self-centered, dumb...

174
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,972
Things that might 
not work for me

175
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:32,000
as part of a tribe.

176
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,152
You know, I'm not saying it,

177
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:37,327
but I'm under contract 
in Miami, Chicago, New York.

178
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,475
Obviously.

179
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,758
He must have thought to amaze 
me by telling me to be a model.

180
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:43,475
The big reveal.

181
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
But I kinda don't care.

182
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,200
Athlete, model, 
personal trainer, whatever.

183
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,575
It's good to have him, 
he's a competitor.

184
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,375
He has the rage to win, 
that makes him an asset.

185
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,205
But I think Chris 
is starting to swell the tribe.

186
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,131
I don't know what to think of Chris.

187
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,375
Apparently, if you listen to him, 
he likes you.

188
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,675
I'm having a little trouble closing it.

189
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,875
Yeah, it's tiring. 
Yeah.

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,219
We're fine with letting 
him do his thing,

191
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:13,875
dig his own grave.

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,400
As long as we win, don't worry 
about smiling and nodding.

193
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,970
But if we lost, 
Chris would be in big trouble.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,100
Whoops !

195
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:44,011
I like this quintet. 
I believe we will prosper.

196
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:47,936
Yes, we have a good mix of skills.

197
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,696
Our chances are good. 
Yes.

198
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:55,222
Straight to the merge! 
Exactly !

199
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:58,936
Mixing the tribes again 
is crazy.

200
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:02,736
But everything is fine. 
In my old tribe, Naviti,

201
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,972
there were five of us and we stuck to it,

202
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:07,111
taking out the Malolo one by one.

203
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:12,547
Now Ang, Kellyn and I 
are still in the majority, 3 2.

204
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,060
The question is Angela.

205
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:18,636
She's been with James 
for quite a while.

206
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,811
So I don't know what she has in mind.

207
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:24,174
It was not 
a battle between tribes,

208
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:28,001
more of an internal battle 
between Chris and Dom.

209
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:32,211
Basically, Wendell and Domenick 
told us:

210
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:36,136
"Let's get out Angela, 
she's Chris's right hand, she's dangerous."

211
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:40,411
And so, Domenick, Morgan and Wendell 
voted Angela,

212
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:43,836
allowing the Malolos 
to eliminate Morgan.

213
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:48,568
Turns out Dom and Chris 
couldn't breathe a breath,

214
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:52,111
get along for a few votes 
and maintain the strength of the Naviti.

215
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:55,011
Instead, 
they attempted to take Angela out.

216
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:59,211
I'm starting to feel 
like that might be a problem.

217
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:03,036
So back at camp, 
I was seriously pissed.

218
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:06,811
When I saw it was 
James and me against three Navitis,

219
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,497
I was afraid of being next.

220
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:14,036
But I found out that Angela 
was betrayed by her own tribe.

221
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:15,611
And she is angry.

222
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,550
I'm here thanks to the Malolos.

223
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:20,671
Not because of my family, 
but because you saved me.

224
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,845
But it's a new day! 
Yes.

225
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,711
New tribe. 
I am delighted.

226
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:28,355
It is enormous. There are cracks 
in the Naviti group.

227
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:31,096
They've already betrayed Angela.

228
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:34,636
So maybe James and I 
can work with her.

229
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:39,111
Dude, good to see you.

230
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,625
I was in danger non-stop!

231
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,399
Both of these tips 
seem to have been awful.

232
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,811
How do you analyze Kellyn and Des?

233
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:52,511
Are they super close? 
Inseparable. Believe me.

234
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:55,911
These five were welded, 
you wouldn't believe it.

235
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:59,552
We had solid arguments, 
but they did not flinch.

236
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:01,755
Bad mix for me.

237
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:04,044
Here I am again at the bottom of the ladder,

238
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:06,855
and as a bonus, 
I'm not that close to Michael.

239
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,499
In fact, he voted for me 
on the second board.

240
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:13,987
However, I still believe we 
are on the same wavelength,

241
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:16,411
because we are only two Malolo.

242
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:19,760
So we have to work together 
and I think he knows it.

243
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:23,311
How do you see Angela? 
Is she close to them?

244
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:27,741
The thing is that we, 
the four ex-Malolo, we saved her.

245
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:31,217
So let's hope 
she feels indebted.

246
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:34,056
But we have work to do.

247
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,797
Welcome to the house !

248
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:47,111
The dump we came from, 
you wouldn't believe it.

249
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:51,571
Returning to the Naviti camp 
is like going from a hovel to a palace.

250
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:55,336
We have coconut, leftover rice, 
coffee... We survive here.

251
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:57,901
Cushions, blankets... 
Coffee?!

252
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:00,311
It was like 
winning an award!

253
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,111
I'm so happy.

254
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:06,190
Strategically speaking, 
Dom is a good ally.

255
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,311
And Chelsea was voting with me.

256
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:12,411
So in theory, the ex-Naviti 
dominate, three against two.

257
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:15,298
But there are many unknowns 
about this new camp.

258
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:18,431
I had no idea coffee 
could make such a difference.

259
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:21,611
You cry ? 
You look like you're crying!

260
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,736
It reminds me of home. 
But yes !

261
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:29,243
In recent days, at Camp Malolo,

262
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,611
we didn't eat, or barely.

263
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,541
We had lost 
four races in a row.

264
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,836
I was completely drained.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,036
Coming here, having this amazing camp,

266
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:43,411
and then this coffee, 
it made me feel at home

267
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:47,936
and made me think I had 
the energy to survive here.

268
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:53,811
If you catch me smiling, 
it's because of my relief.

269
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,846
Not having Chris on your back...

270
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,897
It's nice.

271
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:02,336
I feel like I 
can finally let go.

272
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,808
For the first time, 
I'm relieved

273
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:08,176
from Chris' constant monitoring ,

274
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,836
who repeated: 
"Let's get out Dom, let's get out Dom!"

275
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:13,166
You would see 
the shit I did!

276
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,041
A seashell on a string!

277
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,811
But it worked! 
I can believe it.

278
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:20,527
Perhaps he still believes it to be true.

279
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:23,663
I feel like I'm 
not on defense anymore,

280
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:26,411
and even to have control.

281
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,517
There are three original Naviti

282
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:31,382
and I'm comfortable with Donathan. 
We are together.

283
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:33,711
At the same time, 
they could manipulate me,

284
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:36,195
as I was the first time 
by Libby.

285
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,751
So, no more half measures. 
It's time to get your hands dirty.

286
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:52,044
Libby is a demon 
in an angel body.

287
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,911
She is bloodthirsty.

288
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,836
Who does she think she is dealing with? 
I see clearly in his game.

289
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:00,311
I can sit ? 
Sure.

290
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:04,470
Every time I talk to her, 
she remains evasive.

291
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:08,636
Libby? Not good. She has to go, 
at least as much as Chris.

292
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,011
Where are you at with Donathan and Libby?

293
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:17,450
Libby is...

294
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:21,936
But she'll kill you right away.

295
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:25,336
She has a power of seduction.

296
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,261
She manipulates everyone 
with her southern charm.

297
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:29,978
This is Parvati 2.0.

298
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,644
Thank you for the information.

299
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,311
Dom told me to beware of Libby.

300
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:36,336
She is really dangerous.

301
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,848
So if we go to the council,

302
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:42,016
Libby is strategically 
the best person to eliminate.

303
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,624
As long as we are solid, we have Chelsea.

304
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,436
You do not have to worry.

305
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:50,236
I'm glad to be back here, 
but also to play with you.

306
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,611
You are my closest ally here.

307
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,660
Reconnecting with Dom is great.

308
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,611
He's a great ally for me.

309
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:00,211
We are on the same wavelength, 
it is excellent.

310
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:04,111
Game-wise, I may be 
better than I thought.

311
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,698
Well, I thought I was fantastic,

312
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:09,111
but maybe I really am,

313
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,436
because I feel like I'm 
playing at the top level.

314
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:33,194
Over here, everyone!

315
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:52,600
Ready for your first 
immunity test

316
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:54,973
as new tribes? 
Yeah !

317
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:56,517
First of all Libby...

318
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,426
I take back the idol.

319
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:04,991
This idol is no more.

320
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:07,466
Because now...

321
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,506
two tribes

322
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:13,155
fight for immunity.

323
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,905
Two tribes will be shielded from the vote.

324
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:18,348
Shall we do it? 
Yeah !

325
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,445
Today 
one person will be your voice.

326
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,483
The others will be blindfolded.

327
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:27,413
By verbal commands alone, 
the voice will guide blind duos

328
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,518
to collect 
three bags of puzzle pieces.

329
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:39,479
The three bags recovered, 
the voice will guide a duo of blind people

330
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,246
to solve the puzzle.

331
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,998
The first two tribes 
to complete their puzzle

332
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,212
gain immunity, 
are shielded from the vote.

333
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:49,903
The losers: on the board, 
someone will be the 6th person

334
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,044
eliminated from Survivor Ghost Island.

335
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:54,536
One minute of organization 
and we begin.

336
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,388
Alright, here we go. 
For immunity.

337
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:09,229
Survivors, ready?

338
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:14,097
Go for it ! 
Stay together!

339
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:15,930
Straight !

340
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,919
Not diagonally, straight ahead!

341
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:19,923
Desiree is the voice of Malolo.

342
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:21,995
Faster, there are no obstacles!

343
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,008
Wendell, Yanuya's voice.

344
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,998
Chris, straight ahead! 
Laurel, well, keep going!

345
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,889
And Domenick, the voice of Naviti.

346
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:31,035
Straight ! Straight !

347
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:36,006
Who will communicate best 
with his two duos?

348
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,833
That's the whole point of this test.

349
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,391
Laurel! 
Yes ?

350
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:42,170
At the top ! Raise your arms!

351
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,092
Laurel is on the first sack.

352
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:46,702
Move! No no !

353
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,155
Both hands! Both hands!

354
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,392
I got it !

355
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,422
Kellyn is on the first sack.

356
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:53,757
Go on !

357
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:56,437
Chelsea! To the right !

358
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,806
Stop! 
So ! Go under!

359
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,303
Chelsea, below!

360
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:03,711
On your right ! Dig ! Dig !

361
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,818
You are there! Michael and James!

362
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,771
Michael is on a sack for Malolo.

363
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:09,717
Dig!

364
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,164
Kellyn releases this first bag.

365
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:14,273
Come to my voice! 
Pick it up!

366
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:17,089
Donathan and Chelsea are on a sack 
for Naviti.

367
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:18,559
It's our bag!

368
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:20,070
It's our bag!

369
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:21,928
Donathan, non! Donathan!

370
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,604
Do you have it, James? 
What do I have ?

371
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:25,457
Why is he yelling my name? 
Nope !

372
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:27,376
It's our bag! Go on !

373
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:29,372
We fight over the bag. 
Chelsea, no!

374
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:32,639
Chelsea holds it, Michael too. 
Chelsea, no!

375
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:36,027
We have two duos 
from two different tribes

376
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,347
fighting over the same bag. 
Someone is wrong.

377
00:20:39,513 --> 00:20:40,334
Let go!

378
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,583
It's our bag! 
U-turn!

379
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,909
Chelsea and Donathan dropped the bag.

380
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,217
U-turn, under and to the right!

381
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,753
Come here ! Towards my voice!

382
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:52,762
Angela and Kellyn 
brought their first bag.

383
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,206
Just there ! Move to the right!

384
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:58,374
You and it is!

385
00:20:58,499 --> 00:20:59,565
Bring back the 3rd!

386
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,340
The Malolos have two bags.

387
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:04,195
Michael and James 
go to find the third one.

388
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:07,010
Wendell, where are you? 
Here !

389
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:10,106
Now 
go back to your right.

390
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:12,576
Towards the left ! Left !

391
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,279
Still no bag for Naviti.

392
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:17,773
Two bags for Malolo.

393
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:19,136
All right, Michael!

394
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:20,833
A bag for Yanuya.

395
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,682
Sea bass, to the left!

396
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:24,962
And nothing at all for Naviti.

397
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,729
There you go, Chelsea and Donathan 
have a bag for Naviti.

398
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,686
Follow me ! 
Below, Donathan!

399
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:32,904
Follow me ! 
There, go under!

400
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:37,136
Libby and Bradley 
have Naviti's second bag.

401
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:39,903
Chris, five steps back!

402
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,911
Laurel! Laurel, turn right!

403
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:45,108
I am lost. 
Laurel, all right!

404
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:48,948
Sebastian and Chris 
would like to be guided.

405
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:51,937
Stuck in the middle of nowhere, 
they search.

406
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:53,786
Chris, behind you!

407
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:56,159
To the left !

408
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:59,209
At your feet! At your feet! 
Just there !

409
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:01,520
Get it!

410
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:04,699
Big fall from Michael. 
He digs for Malolo.

411
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:07,027
Bradley! Follow my voice!

412
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,904
Watch out for the pole!

413
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,443
Big shock for Libby...

414
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:13,842
How are you, Libby? 
... On the chin!

415
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,969
Sebastian and Chris 
walk away with Yanuya's second bag.

416
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:20,227
Go to your left!

417
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:24,899
No, your right!

418
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,566
Michael and James 
bring back Malolo's last bag.

419
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:32,964
They lead in a race, 
for the first time in a long time.

420
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:35,216
Third bag for Malolo!

421
00:22:35,341 --> 00:22:38,231
Desiree must now lead them 
to the puzzle table,

422
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,819
eyes still blindfolded!

423
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,362
I protect you!

424
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,600
Donathan and Chelsea collaborate

425
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:45,655
for Naviti's third bag.

426
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,204
You are there! Go on !

427
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:48,372
Below!

428
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:51,219
Desiree issues orders 
to her foursome.

429
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:53,127
Nope ! Here ! Follow my voice!

430
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:56,019
They have to cross the sawdust again, 
still blind.

431
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:59,176
But they lead 
and feel their wings growing.

432
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:00,035
Go on !

433
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,496
Huge advance for Malolo.

434
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:04,326
Go on ! Go on ! 
Go on !

435
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:07,195
Desiree and the Malolos 
are at the puzzle table.

436
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,111
Now she must guide

437
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:12,329
two blind Malolo 
to solve the puzzle.

438
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:17,498
Donathan and Chelsea 
are on Naviti's latest sack.

439
00:23:17,623 --> 00:23:19,374
Good teamwork!

440
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,642
Donathan rotates Chelsea.

441
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,505
He descended ! Let go!

442
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:26,783
Yanuya has all three bags. 
Wendell goes down.

443
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:28,010
Follow my voice!

444
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:30,867
Here are Donathan and Chelsea, 
with the third bag!

445
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,598
Oh ! Chelsea hits the post!

446
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:37,456
It's a race 
to the puzzle table.

447
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,201
Grosse avance de Malolo.

448
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:41,342
They are already on the puzzle.

449
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,776
Yanuya arrives, led by Wendell.

450
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,945
And Naviti, led by Domenick.

451
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,321
Come on ! We are late !

452
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:50,840
Dom, slower! 
We are late !

453
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:53,886
It's teamwork. 
You need to get back up, and fast.

454
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,413
Stay on my ankles!

455
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:58,500
Two tribes 
go through the central tunnel,

456
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:02,385
trying to reach the puzzle, 
where Malolo is already hard at work.

457
00:24:02,664 --> 00:24:04,708
The Malolos would love to win.

458
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:08,777
Kellyn and Angela are on the puzzle, 
guided by Desiree.

459
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:10,529
Fit it into the triangle!

460
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:13,765
Wendell arrives for Yanuya. 
And the 3rd bag?

461
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,261
Where is the bag? 
Domenick right behind.

462
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:18,487
The 3rd...? 
Where are their bags?

463
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,513
Wendell, the leader, 
left without having all the bags.

464
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:26,134
A terrible setback 
that will have a price for Yanuya.

465
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:29,487
Put it in the triangle! 
Feel the hole!

466
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:30,986
In the triangle!

467
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:32,666
Desiree yells at her tribe.

468
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:35,087
No progress of Malolo

469
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:37,419
despite their huge lead.

470
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:39,788
Who are you talking to ? 
To Eng.

471
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,456
The puzzle is a circle.

472
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,994
Domenick has the crucial place. 
He will be a hero or a zero.

473
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,081
Here I am ! 
Wendell is under pressure to catch up

474
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:51,047
what he caused his tribe to lose.

475
00:24:51,172 --> 00:24:53,021
First that, place it in the circle.

476
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:56,428
You need white... 
But which one is it?

477
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:59,515
If you cannot guide 
your blind companions,

478
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,215
you will go to the council.

479
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,524
Push it to the right! 
Again and again !

480
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:10,579
Wendell, who caused 
a major setback to his tribe,

481
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:12,672
quickly regain time.

482
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:15,625
In the circle! Hit the table! 
Just there !

483
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,616
Desiree, who hadn't been able to 
complete the puzzle on the first day,

484
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:21,655
is in charge of the puzzle on the 17th day.

485
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,054
Nope ! The round coin 
you have in your hand, Kellyn!

486
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,535
It goes in the triangle.

487
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:29,577
Now put the round piece.

488
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,492
New piece for Yanuya.

489
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:35,113
Do you see that! The Yanuya 
are back, they lead!

490
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:38,987
The Naviti are now fighting 
against the Malolo.

491
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:40,768
The outer circle is finished.

492
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:42,577
The next one, turn it over!

493
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:44,749
The Malolo take the rhythm.

494
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:47,113
Yes ! Slide it!

495
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:49,782
This test 
is based on communication

496
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:52,852
between the voice 
and the duo taking care of the puzzle.

497
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:53,876
Return it!

498
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:57,107
It would be a huge comeback 
for the Yanuya,

499
00:25:57,232 --> 00:26:00,497
who were dead last 
at their puzzle table.

500
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:03,713
Now they 
are leading and close to victory!

501
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:05,496
Push it! Punch!

502
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:08,745
So ! They think it's good! 
So Probst?

503
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,114
And that's the case ! 
Yanuya wins immunity!

504
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,694
There is one spot left!

505
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:14,840
Now it's Malolo and Naviti,

506
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:17,457
like in the good old days, 
which confront each other.

507
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:20,099
The Naviti are progressing. 
Perfect, good!

508
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:22,724
Only two more pieces for Malolo.

509
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:24,899
Two more for Naviti.

510
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:27,129
Which tribe will conclude?

511
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,701
Desiree screams for Malolo.

512
00:26:29,826 --> 00:26:31,147
Reverse them!

513
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:33,595
Don't yell at me, 
I'm doing my best.

514
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,036
In the other direction, turn!

515
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,240
Domenick screams for Naviti.

516
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:38,825
Put... Yes, it's good!

517
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,342
Is it right ?

518
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,146
That's a puzzle!

519
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,254
Naviti wins immunity!

520
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:48,249
Returning Malolo to the council

521
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:51,321
for the third consecutive time.

522
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:59,461
Wendell, in Survivor, the voice,

523
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,478
it's the hero or the zero.

524
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,769
Today you were both,

525
00:27:03,894 --> 00:27:06,675
but in the end, the hero prevailed 
for Yanuya.

526
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,862
Thanks, Jeff.

527
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:11,102
Immunity is yours. 
No advice tonight.

528
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:15,085
Another victory for Naviti. 
No advice tonight.

529
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:17,569
Good job.

530
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:20,377
Naviti, Yanuya, 
take your things, return to camp.

531
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:22,909
Thanks, Jeff! 
Have a good evening !

532
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:26,903
Malolo, for the fifth time 
this season:

533
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:29,824
the council, where a sixth person 
will be eliminated.

534
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:32,639
Take your things, leave. 
See you tonight at the council.

535
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:37,147
The immunity test was 
a total and utter failure.

536
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:40,443
I surrender once again 
to a council.

537
00:27:40,568 --> 00:27:43,318
This will be my fifth, out of six.

538
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:44,908
It sucks.

539
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,855
This is Survivor Ghost Island.

540
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,305
We want to reverse curses, 
not create new ones!

541
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:09,663
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:21,007
The immunity test today

543
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,645
was probably 
the worst moment of my life.

544
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,249
I wanted this to be the moment 
when I proved myself.

545
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,467
In general, out of the game,

546
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:32,224
I feel like I 
have to prove myself

547
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,148
and I usually 
exceed expectations.

548
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:37,721
And... I failed.

549
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,592
I feel 
like the worst loser.

550
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:49,653
Are you sorry for the test?

551
00:28:51,478 --> 00:28:55,092
In case we can't 
talk about it anymore: do we say James?

552
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,069
How are you?

553
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,188
Take out a strong man, 
even if you want to win so much?

554
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:04,861
It's James or me.

555
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:07,521
Because of me, someone is going to leave.

556
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:09,387
And it sucks.

557
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:12,392
But I'm still 
a player in this game.

558
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:16,363
So the plan tonight 
is to eliminate James.

559
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:18,698
Nobody really has a connection 
with him.

560
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:21,210
I feel like I 
don't know him.

561
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:24,579
So even though it should be me, 
James is going to leave.

562
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:32,921
Without wanting to judge too quickly... 
Des screwed up.

563
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:36,082
Clearly. It was his fault, 
not Kellyn's.

564
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:37,417
Yeah.

565
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:40,260
Have you spoken with Angela? 
No.

566
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:43,196
Because... Without it, we're done.

567
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:44,324
Yeah.

568
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,828
At this stage, 
the ex-Naviti are in the majority.

569
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,056
So Michael and I 
are clearly off to a bad start.

570
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:53,229
But a strong player, in Survivor,

571
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:56,295
must be able to 
receive bad cards

572
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,610
and get away with it.

573
00:29:58,576 --> 00:30:00,440
Finish last...

574
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,488
Malolo seems cursed.

575
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:04,903
Yeah.

576
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:08,949
When I was two years old, my family 
moved to South Korea.

577
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:12,401
And at 16, I decided 
to come back to the USA alone,

578
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:14,528
to make my way 
in a new country.

579
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:17,829
I had to adapt to a new life,

580
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:20,713
a new language, 
a new school without friends,

581
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:23,314
and learn to relate to people.

582
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:26,296
This experience 
prepared me for this moment.

583
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:29,469
Because the heart of Survivor 
is to bond with other humans.

584
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:32,485
I don't want it to be 
one of us tonight.

585
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:35,139
What do you think ? 
Well...

586
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:39,045
Kellyn and Des 
are really, really close.

587
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:41,766
So I'm probably 
at the bottom of the scale.

588
00:30:41,931 --> 00:30:44,121
See what happened 
last time.

589
00:30:44,939 --> 00:30:48,565
It's not you who voted 
for me, but mine!

590
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:51,337
I assure you, 
if you work with me,

591
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:53,360
you won't be down for anything.

592
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:55,427
I trust James.

593
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,918
And in this game, 
relationships are everything.

594
00:30:58,043 --> 00:31:00,433
In the army, it was like a family.

595
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,737
I was surrounded by great friends.

596
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,975
When I retired, I lost 
this great piece of family.

597
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:08,500
Then my daughter 
went to university.

598
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,498
Then I started my divorce.

599
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,085
And now I'm alone.

600
00:31:16,384 --> 00:31:18,641
I don't know, 
it's hard, that's all.

601
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,687
It's hard.

602
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:24,899
But it's positive, 
because I grew up learning

603
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:27,660
to focus 
on the happiness of others.

604
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,497
Now I'm... 
Focused on me.

605
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:33,329
I try to know where I'm going, 
what I want to do.

606
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:34,831
So... ?

607
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:37,984
Are you okay, Michael and you? 
What do you think ?

608
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:41,508
We agree, we will act together. 
Really ?

609
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:44,711
So... 
If you're ready to vote Des...

610
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:48,126
We clearly need strength 
to progress.

611
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:49,032
Yeah.

612
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:53,378
I want us 
both to come back to camp unharmed tonight.

613
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:56,690
I had many 
real discussions with James.

614
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,993
And while wanting 
to remain loyal to Naviti,

615
00:32:00,243 --> 00:32:02,162
I must first take care of myself.

616
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,064
So the only question is:

617
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:06,297
how to go further in the game?

618
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:15,842
What do you have in mind for tonight?

619
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:18,478
I am not sure.

620
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:22,882
The five of us stayed , Bradley, me,

621
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:25,868
Sea bass, Chelsea and Des, 
all the way.

622
00:32:25,993 --> 00:32:27,870
It was self-evident.

623
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,794
And what do you say now?

624
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:35,562
Well... I hope... 
You want to work with me.

625
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,132
I thought Angela 
was ready to work with Des and me.

626
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:44,237
Instead of which 
she comes across as super paranoid,

627
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:46,391
which makes me very nervous.

628
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:49,442
'Cause I can see Angela 
wanting to save James

629
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:51,845
and go after Des or me.

630
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:55,382
I feel great with Des.

631
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,090
Really ? 
We've been together from the start.

632
00:32:59,956 --> 00:33:02,434
We have the majority, seen like that.

633
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,856
Des and I will vote together.

634
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:07,113
I would love for you to work with us.

635
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:12,599
Stick together when it's chaotic. 
This is where it gets tricky.

636
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:16,354
I'm more uncomfortable 
before this advice

637
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:18,295
than ever before in the game.

638
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,777
From the start, I could never 
trust Angela 100%.

639
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:23,981
She goes in all directions.

640
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:27,870
I doubt she fully understands 
what's going on in her own head.

641
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:30,474
And that is dangerous.

642
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,504
I pray it works.

643
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:37,582
But tonight will tell us

644
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:40,202
if Naviti finally fractured,

645
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:42,900
if it's still 
Oranges versus Violets,

646
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:45,544
or if everything has turned brown.

647
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:24,243
Good. So. 
We all know the headline.

648
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:27,525
Malolo is perhaps 
one of the worst tribes,

649
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,841
in terms of performance 
in the tests,

650
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:31,281
we've ever had.

651
00:34:31,406 --> 00:34:34,391
You may never win 
an event as a team.

652
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:37,773
Desiree. What do you feel 
when you're down,

653
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:40,361
advice after advice?

654
00:34:40,486 --> 00:34:44,357
When we lose, when we are at the bottom, 
when things are going badly,

655
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,677
it's an opportunity to reflect 
on who we really are,

656
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:50,829
as if a mirror were being held up to you.

657
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:54,712
And I fully assume 
today's defeat.

658
00:34:54,837 --> 00:34:57,590
And above all, I blame myself. 
What ?

659
00:34:57,715 --> 00:35:00,693
I wanted this to be the moment 
when I could say:

660
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:02,713
"I did it !"

661
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:04,712
And it was...

662
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:07,788
"I did that?! Oh, my God!"

663
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,031
But what makes a winner,

664
00:35:10,156 --> 00:35:12,643
it's how you get up 
after a fall.

665
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,645
So now 
I just have to get up.

666
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:19,834
James. There was an ordeal 
where you felt responsible.

667
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:22,924
You received votes and said: 
"Yes, it is deserved."

668
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:26,908
Would it be fair to eliminate someone 
for losing immunity?

669
00:35:27,182 --> 00:35:31,844
Here it gets tough. Me, my tribe 
gave me a second chance

670
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,576
despite a big mistake.

671
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:38,169
Everything will depend on people's priorities for 
tonight's vote.

672
00:35:38,294 --> 00:35:40,436
Kellyn. You must think about it,

673
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,522
considering who to eliminate:

674
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:44,164
the ability to win.

675
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:47,650
Because without winning, you will reach 
neither the fusion nor the end.

676
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:50,563
Yes. To feel Yanuya win,

677
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,265
then Naviti,

678
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,428
it's horrible.

679
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:58,293
So imagine 
that we didn't all think about it,

680
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,707
it would be a joke. 
We all want to win.

681
00:36:02,123 --> 00:36:03,854
Angela. What do you think ?

682
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:07,643
Because nobody wants to criticize 
someone who gives the best.

683
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:10,550
Absolutely. 
Someone has to carry the torch.

684
00:36:10,706 --> 00:36:13,643
And if we think we have the strength, 
we have to do it.

685
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,473
But if you propose,

686
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:18,864
we expect a hit on goal, 
not a touchdown.

687
00:36:19,617 --> 00:36:22,729
Desiree. It must not 
be pleasant to hear.

688
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:24,927
No, indeed.

689
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:28,835
But if we anticipate 
and think about the future of the game,

690
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:32,023
brute force is not 
what we want to face

691
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,313
when 
the individual events come.

692
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:36,638
James. 
Desiree returns the ball to the group,

693
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:38,649
saying, "Strength, perhaps.

694
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:41,681
But Survivor is a long game 
with multiple levels."

695
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,876
What do you read in his remarks?

696
00:36:44,128 --> 00:36:45,745
His argument makes sense.

697
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,141
We saw physically strong people 
become threats after the merger.

698
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:52,896
At the same time, I feel 
that with this tribe,

699
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:56,434
we are very close to fusion, 
and we know how to reach it.

700
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,615
Kellyn said it: with brute force.

701
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:03,303
Michael. You nod. 
"Let's achieve fusion first!

702
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:05,199
Then we'll see who to eliminate."

703
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:08,024
Sure. You always 
have to have an overview.

704
00:37:08,149 --> 00:37:10,664
If we can't reach 
the important milestone,

705
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:12,209
so what's the point?

706
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:14,935
I want to win, 
like everyone here.

707
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,845
So, to achieve fusion, 
we must have a goal:

708
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,604
keep the tribe strong.

709
00:37:19,729 --> 00:37:21,888
But the other aspect 
of the mixture of tribes,

710
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:25,987
and it's crazy that we haven't 
talked about it yet tonight,

711
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:30,055
but there are three original Navitis 
sitting here,

712
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,554
and two original Malolo.

713
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,092
So we play in his head, 
we do the calculations,

714
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:38,104
and it did not escape me

715
00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:41,223
that long-term relationships 
are just as important

716
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:42,650
that brute force.

717
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:46,372
James. Do you dread 
that ancient tribal alliances

718
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:48,479
are decisive tonight?

719
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:53,058
In that case, it would be 
a little dangerous for Michael and me.

720
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,970
But these original divisions 
into tribes,

721
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:58,180
they were random.

722
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:00,706
You can't be myopic like that.

723
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:04,026
You have to consider 
different ways and people,

724
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,672
reach out to the opposite camp.

725
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:09,171
It's essential in Survivor, 
I think.

726
00:38:09,296 --> 00:38:11,768
Angela. What James 
is saying is very interesting.

727
00:38:11,893 --> 00:38:15,453
“We were in different tribes, 
but they were random.

728
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:18,911
We don't have Naviti or Malolo blood. 
It's just a bandana."

729
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:23,627
It expands the field of 
potentially lasting relationships.

730
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:25,818
It doesn't need to be done 
on day 1.

731
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:28,521
Absolutely. That I was Naviti 
was by chance.

732
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:32,255
And everyone from my original tribe 
voted against me.

733
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,600
The Malolos 
didn't save me directly,

734
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:38,688
but indirectly, that's why 
I'm here today.

735
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:41,873
Out of curiosity, a question to all. 
Be brief.

736
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:45,091
In life, do you rather follow 
your head or your heart?

737
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:46,439
Angela? 
Head.

738
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:47,906
Michael? 
Heart.

739
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:49,943
Desire? 
Head.

740
00:38:50,068 --> 00:38:51,611
James? 
Head.

741
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:53,813
Kelly's? 
pour moi

742
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:58,151
your guts are the perfect blend 
of your head and your heart.

743
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:01,932
When you find and follow 
what your gut tells you,

744
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:04,607
it's because you let 
your heart speak a little

745
00:39:04,732 --> 00:39:06,659
and a little your head.

746
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:10,189
Find the balance 
and decide on that basis.

747
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,578
36 seasons of Survivor

748
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:16,391
and players 
always teach me this game.

749
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:18,452
And I love that. And that being said,

750
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:21,645
it's time to vote. 
Desiree, over to you.

751
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,511
It was you... or me.

752
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:35,932
I hope it's you.

753
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:45,611
I got a second chance

754
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:49,564
and I really wish I 
could give you one. Sorry.

755
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:11,404
I will count the votes.

756
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:22,618
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

757
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:24,541
now is the time to do it.

758
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,652
Good. Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

759
00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:33,117
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

760
00:40:33,242 --> 00:40:34,551
I will read the votes.

761
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:47,455
Desiree. 
One vote James, one vote Desiree.

762
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:55,385
James.

763
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,332
Two votes James, one vote Desiree.

764
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:05,372
Sixth person eliminated 
from Survivor Ghost Island:

765
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:06,389
James.

766
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:09,617
Three is enough. 
Bring me your torch.

767
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:24,074
James, the tribe has spoken.

768
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:28,028
Good game.

769
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:31,003
Playing with all of you was a pleasure. 
Good luck.

770
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:46,119
Your heads, your hearts, 
and ultimately your guts,

771
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:50,556
led you to eliminate 
one of the strongest of the tribe.

772
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:52,484
Judicious? The future will tell.

773
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,194
Take your torches, 
return to your camp. Good night.

774
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:08,808
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

775
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:14,419
Next time in Survivor...

776
00:42:14,544 --> 00:42:16,337
There is fire at Malolo...

777
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:18,028
Let's burn the Malolo flag!

778
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:19,202
It brings bad luck.

779
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:22,395
I'm next, 
but I hope to see the end of the tunnel.

780
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,172
... and fury at Naviti.

781
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:25,085
Go on !

782
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,731
The hardest part is not being 
a perfect asshole.

783
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:29,067
What rotten!

784
00:42:29,192 --> 00:42:31,991
The fire raged inside me.

785
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,569
It was a great surprise elimination . I did not see anything coming.

786
00:42:35,694 --> 00:42:37,224
Hats off to them.

787
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,107
But strangely, I am at peace,

788
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:42,043
because these 17 days, even if it was short 
in the scale of my life,

789
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:43,626
really changed me.

790
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:46,351
I will return to the real 
changed world,

791
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:47,871
with a new look.

792
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:50,000
I come away 
more humble and grateful

793
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:51,996
to say that I played Survivor.
