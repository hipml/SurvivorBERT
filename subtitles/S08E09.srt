>> JEFF PROBST: 21 Days ago, 18

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,099
former castaways returned to
play the ultimate game one more

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,185
time.
They were split into three

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,147
tribes and marooned with only
one machete.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,357
It was the least amount of
supplies ever given to a group

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,694
of survivors.
Their experience and their

7
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,114
eagerness to prove that they
were the best of the best set

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,283
the stage for one of the most
cutthroat<i> Survivor</i> adventures

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,454
ever.
All aspects of the game were

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,914
escalated.
The conflict...

11
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,791
>> I'm not yelling.
I'm just saying, call it like it

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,918
is.
>> I am calling it like

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,253
it is.
We just talked about it.

14
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,255
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )
>> PROBST: The emotion...

15
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,800
>> It's not worth it.
>> PROBST: ...and the struggle

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,136
to survive.
>> Shark bite!

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,304
>> He was not letting
go.

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,808
He was never letting go.
>> PROBST: Tonight, in a special

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,478
episode, we'll take a closer
look at the first 21 days of

20
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,273
<i>Survivor All-Stars</i> through a
series of highlights...

21
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,651
>> Due to someone who
is very ill at home right now, I

22
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,403
need to pull myself out of the
game.

23
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,948
>> PROBST: ...and
never-before-seen footage.

24
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,659
>> We all decided to be
Saboga, who was going to Tribal

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,829
Council that night.
And we had a blast.

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,499
>> All of you<i> Survivor</i>
<i>All-Stars,</i> I think it is time

27
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,295
to vote.
>> My vote is for Jerri!

28
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,214
>> Homey's walking funny
because he has a small problem

29
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:34,344
of chafing going on.
>> And now he's walking

30
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,888
more and more hobbled as the
days go by.

31
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,807
(<i> laughs</i> )
>> Things down in the

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,685
nether regions have become a bit
chapped.

33
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,646
It hurts.

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,608
competitive<i> Survivor</i> to date.
>> It's never been done

44
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,484
before.
No one has ever gone back to

45
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,696
play this game twice.
We know how bad it gets, and we

46
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,282
know how long this road is.
>> This ain't a little

47
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,075

This is for the big boys.

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,745
>><i> All-Star Survivor</i> is
going to be so cutthroat, it's

49
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,788
not even going to be funny.
Nobody trusts anybody, you

50
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,499
understand?
>> PROBST: For the first time,

51
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:34,047
there were three tribes--
Chapera, Mogo Mogo and Saboga.

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,636
When the tribes arrived at their
beaches, they found only a

53
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,931
machete and a map to their water
hole.

54
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,850
>> Oh, nice!
>> We did find our water

55
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,102
source, but we can't drink it
right out of the well.

56
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,313
There's potential brain
parasites that will put you in a

57
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,815
coma.
>> PROBST: The water had to be

58
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,526
boiled, but starting a fire with
no supplies bordered on the

59
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,821
impossible.
>> That's it.

60
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:03,493
>> Come on!
Come on!

61
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,995
>> I did it for two days in
Borneo.

62
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,955
I can't do fire.
I have tried.

63
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,457
>> All right.
There's that positive attitude

64
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:20,969
we're looking for.
>> I'm running out of

65
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,887
steam.
>> Yeah, I think I

66
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,555
could start the fire without
even blinking, but they don't

67
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,518
need to know that.

struggle for fire at Saboga...

(<i> Rupert sighs</i> )
>> My head's ready to

70
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,150
pop.
>> PROBST: ...Rudy struck a deal

71
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,403
with Rupert.
>> I think, uh, me and you

72
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,532
ought to think about an
alliance.

73
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,867
>> You're a man of your
word, too, from what I know of

74
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,035
you.
>> Yeah.

75
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,997
I, uh, figured me and Rupert
ought to protect ourselves and

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,457
form an alliance, and that's
what we did.

77
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,543
>> You and I are going
to be strong to the end.

78
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,503
(<i> Rudy speaks quietly</i> )
>> PROBST: At Chapera, it was

79
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,590
Boston Rob and Amber who were
making a connection.

80
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,051
>> So, what do you
think?

81
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,595
You want to make an alliance?
Cover our own asses?

82
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,557
>> I don't know if I can
take you seriously or not.

83
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,558
>> I'm being 100%
serious.

84
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,769
Amber and I have an alliance,
for obvious reasons.

85
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,063
She's beautiful.
Any idiot can see that.

86
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,775
>> PROBST: While Rob and Amber's
alliance seemed to be made from

87
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,528
the heart, Rob's alliance with
Big Tom was all business.

88
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,406
>> You watch my back,
Tom, I'll watch yours, all

89
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:36,419
right?
>> Me and Rob's got a

90
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,465
little alliance.
No, I don't trust him.

91
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,509
Hell, no.
But I don't trust none of 'em,

92
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,472
and, uh, if Rob will hang in
there with me, we can pull this

93
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:52,643
thing through.
>> It's humid, huh?

94
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,605
Big Tom wants to make an
alliance with me.

95
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,566
He wants to stay tight with me,
you know?

96
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:04,655
I got my thing going with Amber.
I got Big Tom on the side.

97
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,158
I think in his eyes it's a
primary alliance.

98
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,577
In mine, it's secondary.
But he doesn't need to know

99
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,580
that.
Not until the time comes.

100
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,169
>> PROBST: At the first
three-way immunity challenge...

101
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,129
Survivors, ready!
>> Here we go, here we

102
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,631
go.
>> PROBST: Go!

103
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,968
...Saboga fell behind early and
never recovered.

104
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,804
>> Come on, guys, get
me over there.

105
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,598
>> PROBST: And Chapera and Mogo
Mogo shared immunity.

106
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,601
Chapera, Mogo Mogo,
congratulations.

107
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,647
Safe from Tribal Council and out
here at least three more days.

108
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,819
(<i> cheering</i> )
Having dodged the first Tribal

109
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,655
Council, Chapera decided to
create one of their own.

110
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,617
>> Come on in.
First, from<i> Survivor one,</i> Rudy

111
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,871
Boesch.
Next, the winner from<i> Survivor</i>

112
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:59,168
<i>Africa,</i> Ethan Zohn.
From<i> Survivor Pearl Islands,</i>

113
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,337
Rupert.
From<i> Survivor Australia,</i> Jerri

114
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,297
Manthey.
There's Jerri.

115
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,134
>> I just want to pour
some hot chocolate over some hot

116

>> The winner from

117
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,514
<i>Survivor Australia,</i> Tina
Wesson.

118
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,684
And from<i> Survivor Borneo,</i> Jenna
Lewis.

119
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,144
>> Oh, I'm so glad to be
here, everybody!

120
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,814
Oh! Jeff, Jeff!
Oh, Jeff, oh.

121
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,859
>> Let's settle down.
>> We all decided to be

122
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,069
Saboga, who was going to Tribal
Council that night.

123
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:31,784
And we had a blast doing it.
>> Here we are, day three.

124
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:37,540
All of you<i> "Survivor</i> All-Stars."
What's going on? Jerri?

125
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,211
>> What... what is
happening here?

126
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,714
I don't deserve this.
The last time I played

127
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,010
<i>Survivor,</i> we were pretty
serious, but everybody here is a

128
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,846
comedian.
There is not one person who's

129
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,015
not.
>> Rupert, you've been

130
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,267
here for<i> Survivor: Pearl</i>
<i>Islands.</i>

131
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,728
Three months later, you're now
back here in<i> Survivor: Pearl</i>

132
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,356
<i>Islands.</i>
>> The only reason I

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,734
come back, someone messed with
the handlebar of my....

134
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,196
>> I didn't touch your
spear, Rupert.

135
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,573
I never touched your spear.
>> (<i> growling</i> ): Rudy!

136
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,243
>> Come on!
>> How's my hair, Jeff?

137
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,746
I played Ethan because I just
wanted to give him a hard time

138
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,208
and let everybody realize how
ridiculous he looks with his

139
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,877
little jheri curls.
>> I think it is time to

140
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,922
vote.
>> My vote is for holy

141
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,758
roller Tina.
She stabbed me in the back once.

142
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,801
She's not going to do it again.
Tina.

143
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:35,181
>> Jenna, I'm sorry to
have to vote for you.

144
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,976
It's just a game.
Sorry, babe.

145
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,895
>> (<i> In Southern</i>
<i>accent</i> ): Lord, please forgive

146
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,647
me for my language that I am
about to use right now, but Miss

147
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:48,069
Jerri Manthey, I am voting for
you.

148
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,614
You were a bitch the first time
on<i> Survivor Australia</i> and

149
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,782
three years hasn't done you any
good.

150
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,827
You're still a bitch.
My vote is for Jerri!

151
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:01,332
>> I thought everybody
was funny at Tribal Council from

152
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,292
Amber playing Tina to Rob
playing Jeff Probst.

153
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,629
I mean, the kid's obviously
watched a couple<i> Survivors.</i>

154
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,924
He's got him down pat.
>> Jenna, the tribe has

155
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,842
spoken.
>> Thanks, Jeff.

156
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,972
>> See y'all.

Council was no joke for the

159
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,694
losing Saboga tribe.
During a downpour, the stigma of

160
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,656
being a former winner was too
much for Tina to overcome and

161
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,326
she was the first person voted
out of<i> Survivor All-Stars.</i>

162
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:44,375
Tina, the tribe has spoken.
>> TINA: I knew early on that I

00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,044
was in trouble.
You know, there was only one

164
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,672
other winner, and I knew that
they would keep Ethan as the

165
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,008
stronger one.
But what a mistake it would be

166
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,885
to not even play the game.
So that's why I came back, and

167
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,681
it's been a blast.
>> PROBST: On day four, Colby

168
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,851
was dealing with a delicate
situation.

169
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,812
>> Colby's walking funny
because he has a small problem

170
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:10,359
of chafing going on.
I think he has chafed the inner

171
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,988
side of his inner thigh.
>> And now he's walking

172
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,407
more and more hobbled as the
days go by.

173
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,327
(<i> laughing</i> )
>> A true Texan at heart

174
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,787
never complains.
>> Yeah, things down in

175
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:27,376
the nether regions have become a
bit chapped.

176
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,840
My gait, if you will, is my
attempt to get a little air flow

177
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,842
going in there and hopefully
with a little time, everything

178
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,720
is going to heal.
But that's the only way I can

179
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,724
get relief, is just being as
bowlegged as a bull rider who

180
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,061
just stepped off a 3,000-pound
nightmare.

181
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,774
It hurts something fierce.
>> PROBST: Later on day four, a

182
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,943
mysterious box with three locks
arrived at tree mail.

183
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,405
>> Anything at this point
that you get to open is fun

184
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,408
because it's like a gift.
>> PROBST: In a grueling reward

185
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,537
challenge, Ethan carried Saboga
to their first victory.

186
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,208
>> PROBST: Saboga wins reward!
But with the reward,

187
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,212
Saboga faced a tough decision.
Each tribe today received a

188
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,964
lockbox.
I'll tell you what is in the

189
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,050
lockbox.
Rice.

190
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,136
The only problem is that lockbox
and the rice in it does you

191
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,014
no good because you need three
keys to get it open.

192
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,266
And even if you had it open,
without fire, you can't cook the

193
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,936
rice.
So here's the offer.

194
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:33,818
If you take the pot with the
clue and the map and the flint

195
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:41,117
instead of the blankets, Mogo
Mogo gets it as well as Chapera.

196
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,828
>> Give everybody a
chance.

197
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:52,044
(<i> cheers</i> )
>> PROBST: With flint, the

198
00:11:52,128 --> 00:12:00,136
tribes finally got fire.
>> Whoa.

199
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,305
>> We got fire!
Yay!

200
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,057
>> PROBST: With the struggle for
fire behind them, the members of

201
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,936
Chapera turned their attention
to other problems, like

202
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,814
understanding Big Tom.
>> Hey, we ain't got a good

203
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,441
mate among us.
>> You guys get that?

204
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,277
>> No.
>> Big Tom?

205
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,987
Who knows his language?
He's a huge comic relief.

206
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,490
I love sitting back and just
listening to Big Tom, even if I

207
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,492
don't understand anything he
says.

208
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,163
>> So anyway, baby doll may
want to go over and make a big

209
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,583
glob of love and I tell her...
>> We need a translator

210
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,169
on that one.
That was just a little too much.

211
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,464
>> I have no clue what
you just said.

212
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,134
All I heard was "gob of love."
>> Big Tom is by far

213
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,052
worst.
I mean, half the time nobody

214
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,055
knows what he is saying.
>> There's plenty...

215
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,932
>> Huh?
>> I said there's plenty

216
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,518
right there.
>> What?

217
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,312
>> I said there's plenty
over there.

218
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,314
>> Where:
>> Over by them rocks.

219
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,400
Snails.
They sittin' right there.

220
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,028
>> Yeah, there's plenty
of them.

221
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,324
I'm telling you, this guy, half
the time he talks, I just go

222
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,535
"yesum, uh-huh."
You got to have a special degree

223
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:12,583
to be able to speak Big Tom.
(<i> mumbling</i> )

224
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:23,052
"What?"
>> PROBST: At the immunity

225
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,887
challenge on day six...
Survivors, ready?

226
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,183
Go!
...the tribes had to raise boats

227
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,936
from the ocean floor and race to
the finish.

228
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,273
Chapera takes the lead.
>> Go!

229
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,276
>> PROBST: Chapera cruised to
first place, Mogo Mogo's

230
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,197
determination kept them going,
and Saboga's hopes for immunity

231
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,950
sank completely along with their
boat.

232
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,203
Chapera first to cross.
Wins immunity!

233
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,040
Mogo Mogo wins immunity.
For the second straight time,

234
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:58,921
Saboga going to Tribal Council.
Back at the Saboga camp, Rupert

235
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,258
vowed to stay true to his
alliance with Rudy.

236
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,636
>> Rudy came to me on
the first day saying, "I need a

237
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,972
buddy."
>> I know what you're

238
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,307
saying.
I adore him, but we're losing

239
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,018
bad.
>> I am not writing

240
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,939
Rudy's name down.
I know that.

241
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,442
I'm not writing Rudy's name
down.

242
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,156
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,
despite Rupert's loyalty, the

243
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,410
former Navy Seal was the second
person voted out of<i> Survivor</i>

244
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:33,956
<i>All-Stars.</i>
Rudy, the tribe has spoken.

245
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,086
>> Jenna, she kept edging
me on right to two hours before

246
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,131
they eliminated me.
She shouldn't have done that.

247
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,174
I wish I would have lasted
longer.

248
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,428
I'm going to keep doing this
until I win.

249
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,974
>> PROBST: On day seven, Richard
got up close and personal with a

250
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:58,981
shark.
>> I let the head part

251
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:04,278
go for a second, and whoop!
Shark bite!

252
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,698
And I poke him in the eyes.
He takes another chunk deeper.

253
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,533
There was no way-- he was not
letting go.

254
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,286
He was never letting go.
So I swam to get on a rock and

255
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:18,167
pound the side of his head with
a rock until he lets go.

256
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,462
Ee-yai-yai-yai-yai.
>> Oh, my God.

257
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,047
>> His teeth?
Right there.

258
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,090
>> SUSAN: Oh, my God.
>> He's got me,

259
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,176
pulling.
The hell if you're going to stay

260
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,677
on my arm.
It's like this.

261
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,181
>> Is it possible to call
a gay man a stud?

262
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,182
>> It's like man
verses nature.

263
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,017
So Hemingway-esque.
I love it.

264
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,019
>> PROBST: At tree mail, the
tribes received a welcomed

265
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,689
surprise.
>> Oh, my God!

266
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:46,195
>> PROBST: The challenge was to
build the best possible shelter

267
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,365
in 24 hours.
The reward would be a gift of

268
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,076
comfort items dropped from the
sky.

269
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,704
Boston Rob used his construction
expertise and took the reins at

270
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,541
Chapera, and Amber quickly took
notice.

271
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,211
>> I'll admit when I saw
him building that shelter... he

272
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,253
was pretty hot building that
shelter.

273
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,714
He is good at doing what he
does.

274
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,134
It is getting much easier and
easier to flirt with Boston Rob.

275
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,681
>> PROBST: at Mogo Mogo, Jenna's
mind just wasn't in the

276
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,392
challenge.
>> There's a lot of

277
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,311
other factors that come into my
game that may not come into

278
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,106
anybody else's game, like my
mom.

279
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,234
She's had cancer for a long time
and she's not better.

280
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,404
And I'm just afraid she might
pass away while I'm here.

281
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,240
>> PROBST: And at Saboga, Rupert
and Jerri clashed over Rupert's

282
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,576
log cabin design.
>> We are going to dig

283
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,247
down into the sand a couple feet
to add to our height so when you

284
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,208
walk into it, you'll be able to
stand up.

285
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,585
And that's what I want.
>> Rupert's a complete

286
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,421
control freak.
He has to have everything his

287
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,380
way.
He thinks he's the only one who

288
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,259
can do it right.
>> PROBST: As day turned to

289
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,761
night, it became apparent that
Rupert was digging Saboga's

290
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,139
grave.
>> Rupert's idea was a

291
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,099
little ambitious.
We ended up working all through

292
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,394
the night.
>> Not good.

293
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:05,607
>> My God, I could not
believe the stupidity.

294
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,279
This is Rupert gone mad.
>> PROBST: On day eight, a local

295
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,283
contractor visited each beach to
determine a winner.

296
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,618
I brought along with me Rafa,
an expert in construction.

297
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,747
Take a look.
At Mogo Mogo, things got off to

298
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:24,293
a shaky start.
>> Rafa-- he starts going

299
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,588
around the shelter and the first
thing he does is start grabbing

300
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,257
on to things, jerking them,
trying to rip them down.

301
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,261
I don't know that Rafa realizes,
we have to live in the shelter.

302
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,181
>> PROBST: And at Chapera,
things stood on solid ground.

303
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,808
>> You're not moving this.
>> This is three foot in

304
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,853
the ground, and that... all this
is square.

305
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,813
>> PROBST: Ready?
<i>Vámanos?</i>

306
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,356
>><i> Vámanos.</i>
>> PROBST: When the contractor

307
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,360
saw Rupert's underground
shelter, Saboga's hopes of

308
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:55,282
winning seemed all washed up.
>> Saboga? Oh...

309
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:59,369
>> PROBST: You don't like...?
>> No, no, no.

310
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,663
>> PROBST: It's dangerous?
>> Yeah.

311
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,374
This is the... the water...
>> And then I see him

312
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,169
tell Jeff, "Water go down in.
Bad."

313
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,298
>> PROBST: Chapera once again
came out on top.

314
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,469
Their reward for having the best
shelter included blankets, a

315
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,846
mattress and wine.
>> We've never been so

316
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,559
excited in our lives.
That was just a pinnacle moment.

317
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,479
>> PROBST: The mood at Mogo Mogo
was not so cheerful.

318
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,357
Jenna Morasca was contemplating
quitting altogether.

319
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,655
>> Well, I just want to let
you guys know there are a lot of

320
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:39,535
things I thought I would be able
to overcome here, but my mom is

321
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,622
really ill.
I don't think I'd ever

322
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,208
forgive myself if I knew that I
was here playing a game and

323
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,336
something happened to her.
>> PROBST: When the tribes

324
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,712
arrived for the immunity
challenge,

325
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,382
Jenna made her decision.
>> Due to someone who

326
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,219
is very ill at home right now, I
need to pull myself out of the

327
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,347
game.
>> PROBST: I just want to

328
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,725
understand exactly why you're
leaving.

329
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,602
>> She's my mother,
and I should be there in case

330
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,438
something happens.
I love this game, but it's my

331
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,776
family.
>> PROBST: Let's bring in the

332
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:25,414
boat.
>> PROBST: Jenna, we're thinking

333
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,916
about you.
>> Thanks. Bye, guys.

334
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,293
Have fun.
>> PROBST: Jenna Morasca became

335
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:35,591
the second person ever to walk
away from the game.

336
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,887
But her instincts were right.
Eight days later, her mom lost

337
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,266
her battle with cancer with
Jenna by her side.

338
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,268
Night nine brought one of the
worst storms in<i> Survivor</i>

339
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:53,734
history.
>> We need a boat.

340
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,279
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
>> We have constructed a

341
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,616
shelter that is pretty
unbelievable.

342
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,410
>> The shelter held up
pretty good.

343
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:07,414
I slept almost all night long
because I was under the blanket,

344
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,458
warm, and I just slept the whole
night.

345
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,754
>> PROBST: Well, almost the
whole night.

346
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:19,801
>> You're so warm.
>> Boston Rob and Amber

347
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,471
are going to do it.
I don't know when, but they're

348
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,307
going to do it.
>> PROBST: Things weren't so

349
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,394
cozy at Saboga.
Their underground shelter failed

350
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,689
miserably.
>> The stupid shelter

351
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,318
that I built was destroyed.
Digging into the sand is the

352
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:41,657
dumbest idea I've ever had in my
life, and we paid dearly tonight

353
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,826
for it.
>> The rain just started

354
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,371
pouring and the whole shelter
filled up with water.

355
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,500
This never would have happened
if they hadn't dug that hole.

356
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:58,340
It's not worth it.
>> PROBST: the next morning,

357
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:03,470
emotionally and physically
spent, Saboga realized they were

358
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:07,349
back to square one.
>> The plan today is we

359
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,519
got to make shelter, we've got
to make fire and we've got to

360
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,562
get it together now.
>> PROBST: But once again, Jerri

361
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:17,025
was on the outs with her tribe.
>> When we were deciding

362
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,527
where to rebuild our shelter for
the third time, Jerri wanted

363
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,530
nothing to do with it.
>> Oh, come on, you

364
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,491
gotta help.
>> She's had enough, you

365
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:29,037
know.
Check out.

366
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,540
>> Once they started
working on the actual building

367
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,711
process, that's when I felt it
was necessary for me to speak

368
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,755
up.
You're going to put those on top

369
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,008
of the bamboo, uh, the palms,
right?

370
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,511
It needs to go on top, 'cause
otherwise the palms clog it up

371
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,681
and acts as a... whoosh, instead
of a whoosh.

372
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,725
>> You want to really
keep it waterproof.

373
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,810
If you want to put it on top,
I don't care.

374
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,562
I just think with as many palms
as we have, we're only going to

375
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,107
get a foot and a half, two feet.
>> Jenna says put the

376
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,776
bamboo on.
Jerri says no, don't put the

377
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,572
bamboo on and then cops this big
old attitude with me about we

378
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,615
can't discuss anything.
We always just gotta do it your

379
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,160
way.
Well, one of you says the bamboo

380
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,495
is going under and of you one
says the bamboo's going over.

381
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,081
>> Well, that's what
happens when you discuss two

382
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,916
different views.
>> Why can't I say

383
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,127
discuss it?
>> Because it's obvious

384
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,463
that's what's gonna happen.
>> I was very fond of

385
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,923
Jerri.
I thought we were getting along

386
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,469
great until we got the challenge
of building a new shelter.

387
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,889
A little bit of conflict and now
I'm the devil.

388
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,809
It makes me feel inadequate when
the girl won't even look at me.

389
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,438
She will have nothing to do with
me right now.

390
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:50,911
That<i> does</i> make me uncomfortable.
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

391
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,623
On Day Ten, Chapera continued
their victory roll when they won

392
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,126
a<i> Survivor</i> style bathroom, as
well as a clue to the final key

393
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,962
to their lock box.
Take a shower, get cleaned up.

394
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,631
You guys can head back to camp.
Chapera, this is yours to take

395
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,718
back with you.
Chapera enjoyed getting clean...

396
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,475
>> I could do this all
day long every day.

397
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,144
>> PROBST: ...as well as getting
the long-awaited rice from their

398
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,648
lock box.
>> Ah! We got rice!

399
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,485
>> For to us have rice in
our system is just like gas in

400
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,988
the tank, and I think it's gonna
give us a little bit, just that

401
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,825
little more... hoochy.
>> PROBST: The rice helped fuel

402
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,828
Chapera to a large lead in a
jolting immunity challenge.

403
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,705
>> Please don't move!
>> Colby, Colby, Colby, Colby.

404
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,498
>> PROBST: Ethan throws it on
Colby.

405
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,668
>> Ow!
>> Damn it!

406
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,546
>> PROBST: Chapera has their
last piece.

407
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,673
Take your blindfolds off.
Start building the puzzle.

408
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,677
But the pieces didn't fall into
place for Chapera, and Saboga

409
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,640
and Mogo Mogo out-stacked them,
winning shared immunity.

410
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,601
>> (<i> yelling</i> )
>> PROBST: Facing Tribal

411
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:01,022
Council, Rob Cesternino looked
for an ally in Boston Rob.

412
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,526
>> I know you know how
to play the game and I know you

413
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,029
know a lot, and I know you would
be very, like, helpful and we

414
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,950
can make good allies.
>> I... I agree.

415
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,708
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Rob Cesternino got blindsided by

416
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,044
Boston Rob, and he was the first
person voted out of the Chapera

417
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,883
tribe.
Rob, the tribe has spoken.

418
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,718
>> I was targeted early
for coming close to winning last

419
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:34,556
time.
It is especially painful to not

420
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,059
have a fair crack at that
million dollars this time

421
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,187
around.
Being as big of a fan

422
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,689
of<i> Survivor</i> as I am and then
having the opportunity not only

423
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:46,193
to play the game, but to come
back and play an all-star

424
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:51,239
version of the game was really
the ultimate thrill.

425
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,242
>> PROBST: On Day 13, the tribes
arrived for the reward

426
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,912
challenge, and they were hit
with the first big twist of the

427
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,747
game.
The tribe that finishes last

428
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,750
will be dissolved.
>> Wow.

429
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,920
>> PROBST: Gonna have a
schoolyard game of pick 'em.

430
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,963
>> That's wild.
>> PROBST: We will alternate

431
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,965
picks.
The winning tribe gets to pick

432
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,636
first.
Survivors ready?

433
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:16,264
Go!
>> Go Mogo Mogo.

434
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,935
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo paddled to
an easy first-place finish.

435
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:25,774
>> (<i> cheering</i> )
>> PROBST: Chapera's second-

436
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,860
place finish meant Saboga was
no more.

437
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,737
>> We get to pick first.
>> Okay.

438
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,322
>> We got to get rid of
Ethan.

439
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,782
>> Yup. Yeah.
>> Bring him along, Rich.

440
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,953
>> PROBST: In a strategic move,
Mogo Mogo took Ethan and brought

441
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:43,083
Jerri along for the ride.
And Chapera took Rupert and

442
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:48,004
Jenna.
At Chapera, Rupert and Jenna

443
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,966
were immediately impressed by
their new surroundings.

444
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,219
>> Oh...
>> We're home!

445
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,846
We're home.
>> PROBST: And the girls soon

446
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,809
made sure the tribe was united.
>> Jenna, Amber and

447
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:05,313
myself made necklaces.
We found all the shells and we

448
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,984
bonded them together, and they
quickly became symbolic of the

449
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,821
unity that Chapera has, even
though we have two new members.

450
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,824
We have a present for you.
>> Ah, ha-ha...

451
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,910
>> Now we're all...
>> Cool.

452
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,787
>> I love it.
>> It's kinda cool,

453
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,872
right?
We made necklaces for everybody.

454
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,874
>> Thank you.
>> Oh, I like the way you

455
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,085
guys did these with the wire.
>> Don't they look cool?

456
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,838
This is about Tribal...
>> ALICIA and SUE: Unity.

457
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,882
>> You know, it wasn't
apparent over at Saboga how

458
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,968
close Chapera was.
We knew that they had some sort

459
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,845
of bond that kept them winning
uh... because, you know, they

460
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,889
weren't the biggest, they
weren't the strongest, but they

461
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,977
kept winning the challenges, but
now that I'm over here, I see

462
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,354
that there's really a sense of
tribehood here.

463
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,856
>> I will definitely keep
my necklace on and I hope

464
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,358
everybody else will, too.
I don't think we should be

465
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,193
intimidated by them knowing
that we're a strong tribe and

466
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,862
sticking together.
We're gonna take them down one

467
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,115
by one.
>> PROBST: The competition

468
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,910
heated up on Day 15 when the two
newly formed tribes went-head

469
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,872
to-head at the immunity
challenge.

470
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,750
First one to hit the water is
out.

471
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:20,597
Boston Rob took control of the
game and led his tribe to
victory.

472
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,724
Chapera wins immunity!
>> You did it! You did

473
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:28,063
it!
>> PROBST: Back at camp, Colby

474
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,815
changed Mogo Mogo's game plan
when he targeted Richard instead

475
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,693
of Ethan.
>> Richard's the one we

476
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,403
gotta get rid of.
He's the snake in the grass

477
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,405
that's going to cause us the
most trouble.

478
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,408
>> PROBST: But Richard got wind
of the plot when Jerri tipped

479
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,036
him off, putting Colby on thin
ice.

480
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,205
>> Now, Jerri says
she's been approached to get

481
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,749
rid of me.
The only way that could possibly

482
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,919
have happened is Ethan, Lex and
Colby.

483
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,921
Okay. That's it, then, 'cause if
you're not for anything else,

484
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,549
then we'll just do that.
All right, Colby goes.

485
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,052
So they blew it.
How dare you approach somebody

486
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:04,391
to get rid of<i> me?</i>
You must go bye-bye<i> now.</i>

487
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,271
>> PROBST: Despite the scramble
before Tribal Council, Richard,

488
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,400
the first<i> Survivor</i> winner ever,
was dethroned.

489
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,278
>> I've been
bamboozled!

490
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:23,410
Man, oh, man.
>> PROBST: Rich, the tribe has

491
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:27,664
spoken.
>> Food, food.

492
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:32,085
I hope there's some real
underlying, intelligent,

493
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,588
sophisticated game-playing going
on that undermined me and that

494
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,466
I'm not aware of.
I'd love it more than anything.

495
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,470
I'd be shocked as hell, but it
would be fun to see.

496
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:49,644
>> PROBST: All right.

497
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,311
Want to know what you're playing
for?

498
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,313
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, definitely.

499
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,190
>> Please.
>> PROBST: Hopefully you'll like

500
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,693
it.
>> (<i> shrieks</i> )

501
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,655
>> Shish kebabs.
>> PROBST: In addition, the

502
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,992
winning tribe keeps everything
in the basket.

503
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,953
>> Oh, we gotta win.
>> PROBST: For reward!

504
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:13,042
Survivors ready! Go!
Mogo Mogo stomped their way to

505
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,838
an early lead...
>> Yeah!

506
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,048
>> PROBST: ...and never looked
back.

507
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:23,261
And with that, Mogo Mogo wins
reward!

508
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:28,016
>> (<i> cheering</i> )
>> PROBST: Take these...

509
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,059
and the main course, shish
kebab.

510
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,979
>> Oh, my God, that
smells so good.

511
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:42,197
>> PROBST: That night, despite
their hard knocks, Chapera vowed

512
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,241
to stay true to each other.
>> Look, guys, we should

513
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,828
be able to win this, if you
think about it, all right?

514
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,996
We're six-strong, they're
six-strong.

515
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,708
And then we can just roll.
>> Let's all make a pact to

516
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:57,170
stick together.
>> One, two, three, Chapera!

517
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,840
>> PROBST: the next morning,
Mogo Mogo continued to reap the

518
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:06,721
benefits of their reward.
>> We all decided to dip

519
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:10,725
into our coffee bean supply to
make some cowboy coffee.

520
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:14,896
Coffee and sugar.
Oh, it's so delicious.

521
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:19,317
We all sat down and drank
probably about four cups of the

522
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,027
strongest coffee you can
imagine.

523
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,239
And none of us have had coffee
in about a month.

524
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,367
>> I'm starting to get spun.
>> Oh, but it feels good.

525
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,410
>> It feels so good to
be wired.

526
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,412
>> No more water.
Only coffee.

527
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,874
>> Before we sat down to
the coffee, playing checkers

528
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,794
just wore me out.
At this point I'm ready to draw

529
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,714
a finish line and set up a
100 yard dash and start racing.

530
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,049
>> Suddenly we're a much
more exciting group.

531
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:47,053
>> Oh, my God, he's going
to do a cartwheel!

532
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,806
>> Yay, coffee!
>> Anybody got some

533
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,933
coffee?
Man, that coffee is good!

534
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,102
>> You drank coffee?
>> I think I had some

535
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,771
coffee.
We had the best coffee of our

536
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:59,899
entire life.
Who would have thought just

537
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,235
bringing and introducing a
little coffee into the tribe

538
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,362
would have made the biggest
difference in the world?

539
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:09,993
>> I mean, listen to us,
we're like bamboozled.

540
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,287
This is nuts.
The caffeine is just like

541
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,081
rifling through our bodies.
My eyes are opened.

542
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,959
I mean, I thought I was having
vision problems.

543
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,921
I was also getting my glasses.
I just need caffeine.

544
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,842
Ready.
>> It's a very happy

545
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,094
beach right now.
Don't know how long it will last

546
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,430
but as long as we've got coffee,
we're going to be up and

547
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:38,146
smiling.
>> Whoo!

548
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:43,109
>> PROBST: on day 19, Boston Rob
had his hands full.

549
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:47,697
>> I'm out here on a
deserted island in Panama, and I

550
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,158
got two beautiful women, and
they want to make a sandwich out

551
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,827
of me.
What am I going to do?

552
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,206
Would you say no?
Seriously, smarten up.

553
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,168
>> Boston Rob and
Amber are very close, and I'm

554
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,172
friends with both of them, so
all three of us sleep connected.

555
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,216
I mean, we're rolling around
hugging each other.

556
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,013
I mean, it's friends.
>> I'm definitely

557
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,058
conscious of Jenna hanging out
with Rob a lot.

558
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,893
And I think it's definitely a
good thing.

559
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,186
It takes some of the tension off
of me and Rob hanging out

560
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:22,523
together.
I'm not going to get jealous of

561
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,068
any of her hanging on him or
doing anything like that.

562
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:29,197
I have Boston Rob wrapped around
my little finger.

563
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,866
>> Awesome.
A strategy to everything, you

564
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:35,328
know?
Like there's strategy to putting

565
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,206
my arm around Jenna while I have
it around Amber at the same

566
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,375
time.
You've got to keep your friends

567
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,168
close, but you got to keep your
enemies closer.

568
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:46,422
Make no mistake.
I'm here to play<i> Survivor.</i>

569
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,884
At the end of this, hopefully
Amber and I can be having some

570
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:54,847
fun together, and we'll be
spending my million.

571
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:59,185
Worst case scenario, we'll be
spending hers.

572
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,064
>> PROBST: At the challenge on
day 19, the tribes learned just

573
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,275
how much was at stake.
In addition to being a reward

574
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,905
challenge, it is also an
immunity challenge.

575
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,240
>> Wow.
>> PROBST: One more twist: the

576
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,244
winning tribe will select one
member from the losing tribe to

577
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,580
join them on the reward, which
means they partake in the

578
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,917
barbecue and they avoid Tribal
Council.

579
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,378
Survivors, ready?
Go!

580
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,422
Once the challenge got under
way...

581
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,299
Mogo Mogo with a bit of a lead.
Ethan is off heading into the

582
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,219
jungle.
Boston Rob close behind!

583
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,304
>> Come on, Rob!
>> PROBST: ...the race to the

584
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,266
finish line was tight.
We're neck and neck!

585
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,477
In a hard-fought duel, Chapera
pulled out a last-moment

586
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,522
victory.
Mogo Mogo off course now.

587
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,275
Chapera heading straight for
their dock!

588
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:53,948
Chapera wins reward and
immunity!

589
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:58,202
(<i> cheers</i> )
Chapera chose to kidnap Kathy.

590
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,372
Kathy.
At first, Kathy wasn't

591
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:05,293
comfortable leaving her tribe
behind for a day of luxury.

592
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:09,297
Chapera, by the way, that's your
ride, a 94-foot luxury yacht.

593
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,466
(<i> screams</i> )
But after a barbecue...

594
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,134
>> Some people grabbed
plates.

595
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,303
I didn't even grab a plate.
>> PROBST: ...some dessert...

596
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,429
>> Oh, look at this,
custard.

597
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,307
>> PROBST: ...and a dip under a
tropical waterfall...

598
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,517
(<i> screaming</i> )
Kathy warmed up to her new

599
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,145
friends.
>> I feel totally

600
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,231
welcomed by Chapera.
I mean, they brought me in like

601
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,192
I was one of their tribe
members.

602
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,279
>> ♪ We got a new girl, her name
is Kat ♪

603
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,157
>> We got a new girl, her name
is Kat

604
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,203
>> ♪ She fits in just like that
>> She fits in just like that. ♪

605
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:44,290
>> PROBST: While Chapera was
cruising, Mogo Mogo was getting

606
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:54,342
down and dirty.
>> PROBST: but Lex had a

607
00:34:54,425 --> 00:35:01,182
down and dirty.
>> PROBST: but Lex had a

608
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,684
different plan in mind.
>> You don't get far in

609
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,021
this game by playing safe.
I find myself now at the doorway

610
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,690
of an opportunity to do
just that for the first time in

611
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,068
the game, to really do something
that probably no one is going

612
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,320
to expect me to do.
Their plan is to get rid of you

613
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,322
tonight.
>> I knew that was

614
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,658
coming.
>> They think I'm in with

615
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,536
them and that Shii Ann is as
well.

616
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,331
We're going to do Colby tonight.
>> I'm very content with

617
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,209
that decision.
Colby doesn't see this coming at

618
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,336
all.
He doesn't see a single vote

619
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,381
coming in his direction.
And if it took losing today to

620
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,342
get him out of here, I'm totally
fine with it.

621
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:43,057
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Jerri won the game of cat and

622
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,018
mouse and her revenge was
complete.

623
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,397
Colby was the next person voted
out of<i> Survivor All-Stars.</i>

624
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,694
Colby, the tribe has spoken.
>> I had to make

625
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,404
decisions and getting rid of
Richard was a move that my

626
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:00,324
entire tribe had to make, but I
was left to orchestrate it and

627
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,703
that really just threw me out in
the open.

628
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,415
In the other tribe members eyes,
it seemed as though I was trying

629
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,292
to become the power player, the
shape-shifter.

630
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,459
It wasn't that at all, but
unfortunately that's the way the

631
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:18,175
game goes.
>> PROBST: on day 20 with Colby

632
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,429
gone, Ethan realized he was
still treading water.

633
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,432
>> I thought everything
was going smoothly and, boom, I

634
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,475
thought I was pretty close to
Lex.

635
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,437
Not anymore.
I don't know what I'm going to

636
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,356
do here.
>> PROBST: Later that day, the

637
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,568
tribes played for a chance to
loot items from the other camp.

638
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,446
Here we go.
First match-up, start spinning.

639
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,450
Chapera's balancing act led them
to a win.

640
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,162
>> Run, run, run!
Run, run, run!

641
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,623
>> Yeah!
>> PROBST: And Jenna was sent to

642
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,292
Mogo Mogo to retrieve a grill, a
bag of rice, and a Hawaiian

643
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,337
sling.
>> I've been waiting 20

644
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,465
days to not have to poke fish
with a stick.

645
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,301
I'm going to be the hunter
tomorrow.

646
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,304
>> PROBST: while Rupert
salivaged over the sling, Boston

647
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:08,768
Rob and Amber's relationship
reached new heights.

648
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,480
>> You're not ever
supposed to feel secure in this

649
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:16,776
game, but with Rob and I having
an alliance, I feel 99.9%

650
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,488
secure.
>> PROBST: The following morning

651
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,783
a fishing competition began to
brew between Boston Rob and

652
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,494
Rupert.
>> Rupert is all excited

653
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,538
about having the Hawaiian sling.
You know, it's his baby.

654
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,333
Now he can catch a fish and show
how much he's worth to the

655
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,252
tribe.
First of all, the guy looks like

656
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,630
Grizzly Adams but he thinks he
Aquaman in the ocean.

657
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,465
And he comes back with a bag of
fish feeling all good about

658
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,718
himself.
>> My God, it took all I

659
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,470
had to stop.
>> I proceeded to go

660
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,473
into the water and catch 11 fish
myself.

661
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:52,228
Boston-style.
>> Sometimes I really

662
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,189
like Boston Rob.
>> I got two at one time

663
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:58,693
on one of them.
>> Other times I see

664
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,863
kind of an arrogant pain in the
ass.

665
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:08,202
>> PROBST: At the immunity
challenge, it was a dismal show

666
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:16,544
of marksmanship.
Before Chapera narrowly escaped

667
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,548
with victory.
Chapera wins immunity!

668
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,843
Mogo Mogo heading to Tribal
Council.

669
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,847
Back at Mogo Mogo, Lex took his
old friend Ethan aside and gave

670
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,852
him some bad news.
>> I think it's just better

671
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,396
for my game if we vote you out
tonight.

672
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,772
It has nothing to do with
friendship.

673
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,607
This is business.
I've got my own agenda this

674
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,693
time.
I've got my own plan.

675
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,696
It doesn't include him.
This isn't Africa.

676
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,448
This is<i> All-Star.</i>
>> PROBST: But Ethan wasn't

677
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,574
about to go down without a
fight.

678
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:51,537
He approached Kathy with a plan.
>> There's no rhyme or

679
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,248
reason of how Lex is playing
this game.

680
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:57,585
There will be no sense of
security with Lex at any time.

681
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,254
>> But I don't want to
take Lex out before Jerri.

682
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:01,464
>> No.
>> It will be Jerri

683
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,592
tonight, all right.
>> So I'll vote for Jerri

684
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,634
and then you and Shii Ann can
talk about it.

685
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:13,434
And I'm a gambler.
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

686
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,480
Ethan's gamble didn't pay off.
He was the next person voted out

687
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:26,030
of<i> Survivor All-Stars.</i>
Ethan, the tribe has spoken.

688
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,784
>> I've been just
struggling since day one trying

689
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,579
to fight and bite and scramble
my way through this game.

690
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,956
And I lasted 21 days.
And I'm proud.

691
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,709
I made it further than any other
winner.

692
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,296
I have the title of<i> Survivor:</i>
<i>Africa</i> champion, and no one can

693
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:43,631
take that away from me.
No matter what I do from this

694
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,634
point on for the rest of my
life, I have that, and that's a

695
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:53,682
good feeling.
>> PROBST: Where once 18

696
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,811
all-stars stood, now only ten
remain.

697
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,481
What experiences and twists
await Big Tom, Amber, Boston

698
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:08,948
Rob, Alicia, Rupert, Jenna, Lex,
Kathy, Jerri and Shii Ann as

699
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,660
they attempt to outlast all the
others and become the ultimate

700
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:17,665
sole<i> Survivor?</i>
Join us next week as the

701
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,208
adventure continues.

702
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,801
Stay tuned for scenes from our
next episode.

703
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,307
Next time on<i> Survivor.</i>

704
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,684
Being on a losing team all the
time is just depressing.

705
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,854
The gap between both the tribes
couldn't be wider.

706
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,688
>> We were just tickled today.

707
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,691
>> But while everyone is talking
merge-

708
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,860
>> I'm ready for merge, I'm
ready for all this to be one
tribe.

709
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,863
What happens next will turn
their world upside down.

710
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,072
Drop your buffs.

711
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,992
I feel like I'm one who got
screwed in this whole situation.

712
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,247
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

713
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,500
Just another beautiful day here
on the island.

714
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:01,917
Of Shapire isnt it?

715
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,379
Little overcast.

716
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,006
Little overcast, Silas.

717
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,549
Wind breezing in your face.

718
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,258
Out of the northwest.

719
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,552
Just smell that?
(deep inhale)

720
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,012
(deep exhales)

721
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,555
You need another shower bro.

722
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,515
(chuckles)
