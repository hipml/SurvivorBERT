00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,024
THE NEXT EASY TARGET IS GOING TO

190
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:58,608
BE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE VOCAL.

191
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,818
>> I WAS THE EASY TARGET BEFORE.

192
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,944
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE VOCAL.

193
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,821
>> I'M ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE

194
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,113
EASY TARGET.

195
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,031
>> EXACTLY.

196
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,616
>> I'M NOT A QUITTER BUT THESE

197
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,327
ARE CHILDISH, IMMATURE GAMES--

198
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,079
>> THAT'S PART OF THIS WHOLE

199
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:11,370
CRAZY GAME.

200
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:11,746
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

201
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,582
>> IT MAY NOT BE YOUR GAME BUT

202
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,459
THAT'S PART OF THE GAME.

203
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,544
YOU DON'T RUN ACROSS SHAMARS

204
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,462
EVERY DAY BUT IN MY LIFE I HAVE

205
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,381
COME ACROSS PEOPLE WITH THAT

206
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,424
KIND OF ATTITUDE.

207
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,885
I OWN SEVERAL FRANCHISES WHO

208
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,011
EVERYBODY WHO WORKS FOR ME IS

209
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,554
UNDER THE AGE OF, SAY, 24, SO

210
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,642
THAT'S ALL I DO IS DEAL WITH

211
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,060
SNOTTY, TEENAGED BRATS ALL DAY

212
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,520
SO I THINK I'M THE CLOSEST ONE

213
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,230
WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW HE THINKS

214
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:37,814
OUT HERE BUT HE NEEDS TO SHUT

215
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:37,980
UP.

216
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,650
>> I UNDERSTAND IT WAS A GAME

217
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,276
BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP SITTING

218
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,902
HERE AND LYING.

219
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,736
>> BUT THEY WILL.

220
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,571
>> BUT I CAN'T DO THAT.

221
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:45,988
>> BUT THEY WILL.

222
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,531
>> I'M OVER IT.

223
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,991
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

224
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,409
I CAN'T DO ( BLEEP ).

225
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,620
THIS AIN'T MY KIND OF LIFESTYLE,

226
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:52,787
MAN.

227
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,621
I'M JUST KIND OF FEEL LIKE IN

228
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,624
THIS GAME, I'M LIKE THE BLACK

229
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:56,833
SHEEP.

230
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,625
I HONESTLY CAME INTO THIS GAME

231
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,627
REALLY WANTING THE MILLION

232
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,838
DOLLARS BUT WHEN I ACTUALLY SEEN

233
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,588
HOW PEOPLE ACT, IT'S KIND OF

234
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,841
LIKE-- IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH IT

235
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,007
TO ME.

236
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,678
THAT'S WHERE IT'S KIND OF

237
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,011
DISHEARTENING.

238
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,222
THAT'S WHERE I QUESTION, YOU

239
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,223
KNOW, HOW MUCH I SHOULD BE IN

240
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:32,994
THIS GAME

241
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,413
>> I'M 54 YEARS OLD.

242
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,707
TO BE PLAYING "SURVIVOR" AGAIN,

243
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,000
I'M ACTUALLY HAVING THE TIME OF

244
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:39,834
MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

245
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,127
54 IS JUST A NUMBER.

246
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,670
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, IN MY

247
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,714
DAILY LIFE, I REALLY KNOW HOW TO

248
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,507
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

249
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,219
I REALLY KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

250
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,512
I WORK OUT.

251
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,389
FOR MY AGE, TO DO WHAT I DO,

252
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,056
IT'S PHENOMENAL.

253
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,058
WHEN I GO TO THE GYM NOW AND I

254
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,560
PLAY FOUR-COURT BALL, I'M

255
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,478
PLAYING WITH MEN HALF MY AGE.

256
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,813
AND I HAVE A LITTLE THING.

257
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,607
I GET A LITTLE REBOUND, SPRINT

258
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,692
TO THE CORNER WITH IT.

259
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,693
DOUBLE DRIBBLE.

260
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,612
GO FOR IT, ONE STEP BACK, ALL

261
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,197
AIR, BABY.

262
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,948
PLAYING WITH GUYS TWICE MY

263
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:11,199
HEIGHT.

264
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,366
LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M

265
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:12,825
GOING TO DO OUT THERE.

266
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,660
AND THEY CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M

267
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,786
DOING.

268
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,706
"HEY, MAN, YOU'RE PLAYING PRO

269
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,540
NBA BALL."

270
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,752
NOT, YOU'RE JUST NOT USED TO THE

271
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:27,965
LARRY BIRD.

272
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:28,341
I'M OLD SCHOOL.

273
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,550
>> WHAT WILL WE DO WHEN THERE'S

274
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,346
A SWITCH AND SOME PEOPLE ARE

275
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,473
LEFT HERE DO WE GIVE THEM BEANS.

276
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,724
>> ANDREA AND PHILLIP HAVE

277
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,767
PLAYED TOGETHER AND HAVE A

278
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,684
CONNECTION, AND COCHRAN AND DAWN

279
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,853
HAVE PLAYED TOGETHER AND HAVE A

280
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,064
CONNECTION SO THAT REALLY LEFT

281
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,108
MALCOLM AND I AND WE GRAVITATED

282
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:46,525
TOWARDS EACH OTHER.

283
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,402
>> THERE ARE A MILLION PLACES IT

284
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,654
COULD BE.

285
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,029
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

286
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,614
>> IT HAS TO BE NEAR SOMETHING.

287
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:56,410
IT HAS TO BE CATFISH.

288
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:56,786
HE'S SUPER SMART.

289
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,746
HE WENT TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL.

290
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,332
AND IT DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE

291
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,667
SOMEBODY GOOD LOOKING AROUND.

292
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,461
>> THAT'S GROSS.

293
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,089
>> REACH AROUND-- NO WAY.

294
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:12,593
>> NO!

295
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,844
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S A CLUE OR

296
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,972
DO YOU THINK IT'S AN IDOL?

297
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,306
I'M SO EXCITED.

298
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,557
>> CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FOUND

299
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,600
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

300
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,520
FINALLY I GOT SOME POWER IN

301
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,354
MYBACK POCKET.

302
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:27,817
♪ I GOT THE IDOL NAH-NAH-NAH ♪ ♪

303
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,651
>> WE'LL BURY IT.

304
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,404
>> I'M NOT THRILLED CORINNE

305
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,530
KNOWS I HAVE THE IDOL.

306
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,614
OF COURSE IN A PERFECT WORLD I

307
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,824
WOULD HAVE IT ALL TO MYSELF BUT

308
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,660
CORINNE DOES KNOW ABOUT IT AND

309
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,120
SHE'S SOMEONE WHO LUCKILY I DID

310
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,372
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH

311
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,623
EARLY ON THIS GAME.

312
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,084
OUR WAGONS KIND OF HITCHED

313
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,586
TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THIS IDOL

314
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:46,752
NOW.

315
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,129
IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT VERY WELL

316
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,173
OR WE'RE GOING TO BURN DOWN

317
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,425
QUICKLY BECAUSE SHE WILL NOT GO

318
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,092
DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

319
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,011
>> NOBODY JOONS NOBODY KNOWS.

320
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,970
>> DONE.

321
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,514
GAME, SET, MATCH.

322
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,908
>> WHAT IT DOES IS, WHEN THE

323
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,453
WIND BLOWS, IT TRAPS THE AIR AND

324
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,704
MAKES LIKE A CIRCULAR AND IT

325
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,204
COOLS YOU.

326
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,165
>> BACK AT HOME, I'M WAITING THE

327
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,458
WHOLE WEEK LONG FOR WEDNESDAY

328
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,501
NIGHT TO ARRIVE SO I CAN TURN ON

329
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,711
CBS AND SEE WHAT'S IN STORE.

330
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,464
CAN I SIT IN THE MAGICAL SEAT,

331
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:31,672
PHIL?

332
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,715
>> YES, YOU CAN SIT IN THE SEAT.

333
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,175
I CROWN YOU.

334
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,801
>> BUT WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THIS

335
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,844
GAME EVERY SINGLE DAY IS LIKE

336
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,679
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT EIGHT.

337
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,972
IT'S WILD.

338
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,352
I GET TO WATCH "SURVIVOR" WHILE

339
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,312
I'M PLAYING "OF "SURVIVOR."

340
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,482
AND FOR A "SURVIVOR" NUT LIKE

341
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,024
ME, IT'S GREAT.

342
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:50,775
I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE IN THIS

343
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,318
WORLD DON'T DO THIS.

344
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,028
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A

345
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,320
SPECIALIST.

346
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,738
>> IT'S NOT NORMAL FOR ME TO BE

347
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,656
SURROUNDED BY THESE BEAUTIFUL

348
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,533
WOMEN WHO ARE HALF THE TIME JUST

349
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,993
WEARING THEIR UNDERWEAR.

350
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,079
THAT'S SOME SORT OF FREUDIAN

351
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,873
PICNIC, I THINK, BUT IT'S REAL

352
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,082
HERE.

353
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,459
>> IT'S A GOOD THING THAT

354
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,835
THERE'S AN IDOL BETWEEN US

355
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,545
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

356
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,171
PEOPLE REALLY WANT YOU TO GO TO

357
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,214
THE VERY END.

358
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,840
>> WHY ARE THEY, LIKE, INTENSELY

359
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,091
TALKING?

360
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,219
>> I JUST DON'T GET WHAT THEIR

361
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:18,552
LOYALTIES ARE.

362
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637
>> I'VE LEARNED FROM THE LAST

363
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,805
TIME I PLAYED THAT YOU HAVE TO

364
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,263
ALWAYS BE THINKING.

365
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,017
EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A

366
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,936
GROUP, IT'S SOLILD, THERE COULD

367
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,895
BE BETTER OPTIONS AND I REALLY

368
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,105
WANT CORINNE OUT.

369
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,817
I DON'T KNOW WHERE MALCOLM IS

370
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,110
AT, BUT DOESN'T CORINNE WORRY

371
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:34,276
YOU?

372
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,485
>> YES.

373
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,278
>> WE HAVE A SIX AND LET'S JUST

374
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,197
HANG OUT AND SHE'S HAVING SO

375
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,823
MANY ONE-ON-ONE INTENSE

376
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,782
CONVERSATIONS WITH EVERYBODY.

377
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,661
>> HER AND MALCOLM ARE

378
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,078
REMARKABLY CLOSE.

379
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,413
>> YOU SAW THEM TALKING.

380
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:52,545
WHAT IF WE COULD GET A UNANIMOUS

381
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,963
VOTE.

382
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,589
US FIVE ARE CLOSE.

383
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,966
YOU'RE CLOSE TO BRANDON, RIGHT.

384
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:57,466
>> YES.

385
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,677
>> I DON'T THINK SHE'D MAKE A

386
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,095
MOVE RIGHT NOW BUT I WANT TO GET

387
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,972
HER OUT OF HERE BEFORE SHEIK GET

388
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,640
RID OF ME.

389
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,975
I THINK CORINNE AND MALCOLM ARE

390
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,725
REALLY CLOSE.

391
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,518
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE--

392
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,729
>> I DEFINITELY WANT WANT TO DO

393
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:10,938
THAT.

394
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,523
>> I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ON THE

395
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,399
SAME PAGE AS ME.

396
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,358
IT'S HARD BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

397
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,277
TO TALK TO THE WRONG PERSON TOO

398
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,945
EARLY AND IT GETS BACK TO

399
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,363
CORINNE THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT

400
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,448
SOMETHING, AND THEN ITS TARGET'S

401
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:20,656
ON ME.

402
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,825
>> WE DON'T WANT YOU TO BE NEXT

403
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,910
TO GO, AND IF YOU STAY WITH US,

404
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,369
IT COULD BE SOMETHING.

405
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,913
>> I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A CHANCE

406
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,958
TO ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, BE A PART

407
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,209
OF SOMETHING ACTUAL LEGIT NOW.

408
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,378
>> WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING?

409
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,546
>> ANYTHING.

410
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,173
I'M NOT PLAYING THE SAME GAME I

411
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,174
USED TO.

412
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,718
>> CORINNE.

413
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,136
>> ANY QUESTIONS?

414
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:42,803
>> NO.

415
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,221
I'M GOOD.

416
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,892
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I'M SAFE.

417
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,310
"YOU'RE SAFE, YOU'RE SAFE,

418
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:49,935
YOU'RE SAFE."

419
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,313
BUT IT'S REALLY SKETCHY BECAUSE

420
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,022
THERE'S A VOICE IN THE BACK OF

421
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,858
MY HEAD THAT SAYS, "YOU'VE BEEN

422
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,568
DONE LIKE THIS BEFORE.

423
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,236
YOU'VE BEEN COAXED ALONG TO

424
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,613
BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

425
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:00,821
TRUE."

426
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,364
>> DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

427
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,157
IT'S HUSH-HUSH.

428
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,366
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

429
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:04,992
LYING GOING ON.

430
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,745
THEY TELL ME, "HEY, BRANDON,

431
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,413
YOU'RE GOING OUT NEXT."

432
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,581
I'LL PEE IN THE RICE.

433
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,624
I'LL PEE IN THE BEANS.

434
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,042
I'LL BURN THE SHELTER TO THE

435
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:13,250
GROUND.

436
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,419
I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

437
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,337
>> GOOD TALK, THOUGH.

438
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,004
>> GOOD TALK.

439
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,297
THANK YOU, GUYS.

440
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,048
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

441
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,759
I'M GOING TO TRY 150% EACH AND

442
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,344
EVERY CHALLENGE, BUT IF WE LOSE

443
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,637
AND MY EFFORTS AREN'T GOOD

444
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,889
ENOUGH FOR THEM TO KEEP MEAN

445
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,474
AROUND, BY GOD, I'M GOING TO

446
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,100
BE-- THERE'S GOING TO BE HELL TO

447
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:38,108
PAY IN CAMP.

448
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,621
>> MY HAPPINESS IS NOT WORTH A

449
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:50,996
MILLION.

450
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,541
I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ANGRY

451
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,459
BLACK MAN ON "SURVIVOR."

452
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,585
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

453
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:56,919
IT'S JUST NOT.

454
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,963
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF HAPPY

455
00:13:59,046 --> 00:13:59,296
THOUGHTS HERE.

456
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,091
AND IT REALLY SUCKS IF I HAVE TO

457
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:07,054
QUIT THIS GAME, BUT IT'S, LIKE,

458
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,973
IS NOT QUITTING NOT WORTH NOT

459
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,432
BEING HAPPY?

460
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,518
AND THAT'S WHERE, YOU KNOW, IT'S

461
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,769
A NO-BRAINER TO ME.

462
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,938
>> I MEAN, I KNOW YOUR DECISION

463
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:16,981
IS PROBABLY MADE UP AT THIS

464
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,107
POINT.

465
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,984
( LAUGHS."

466
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,571
>> BUT I JUST WANT YOU KNOW THAT

467
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,113
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO STAY.

468
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,198
>> STOP IT, LAURA!

469
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,157
>> REALLY, SHAMAR.

470
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,701
I THINK BECAUSE WE'RE ALL SUCH

471
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,326
BIG FANS OF THE SHOW WE WERE ALL

472
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,036
A LITTLE BIT THROWN BACK BY THE

473
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,998
FACT THAT SHAMAR WOULD TAKE IT

474
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,125
SO FAR AS TO QUIT.

475
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,751
>> AFTER I CAME HOME FROM IRAQ,

476
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,545
I HAD A VERY TOUGH TIME

477
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,381
ADJUSTING TO LIFE OUTSIDE OF THE

478
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:42,756
MILITARY.

479
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,008
I WAS AN ALCOHOLIC.

480
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,844
AND I HAD A LOT OF ANGER ISSUES.

481
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,095
WHEN I FIRST CAME HOME, PEOPLE

482
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,763
WERE LIKE EVEN SCARED TO BE

483
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,181
AROUND ME.

484
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:51,974
BECAUSE I WAS IN THAT DARK

485
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,975
PLACE, LIKE PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW

486
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,394
HOW I WAS GOING TO REACT TO

487
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:55,644
THINGS.

488
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,437
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS

489
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,479
GOING TO DO.

490
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,439
THERE WAS SITUATIONS THAT

491
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,982
HAPPENED IN IRAQ THAT, YOU KNOW,

492
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,401
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO LIVE WITH

493
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,527
YOU KNOW.

494
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,029
I WATCHED SUICIDE BOMBINGS IN

495
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,530
FRONT OF ME.

496
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,782
I SEEN MY FRIENDS IN BODY BAGS,

497
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,409
AND I'VE JUST BEEN IN A LOT OF

498
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,660
TIGHT SITUATIONS THAT I JUST

499
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,161
CAN'T FORGET ABOUT.

500
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:18,250
AFTER SOME TIME, I LEARNED TO

501
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,918
LOVE MYSELF, AND I GOT OUT OF

502
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,086
THAT DARK PLACE.

503
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,755
I COME HERE.

504
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,339
I TRY TO BE A HAPPY PERSON.

505
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,009
I TRY TO UPLIFT EVERYBODY.

506
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,262
AND EVERYTHING IS SHAMAR'S DOING

507
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:30,804
THIS.

508
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,473
SHAMAR'S DOING THAT.

509
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,017
CERTAIN PEOPLE TALKING TO ME

510
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,976
CONDESCENDINGLY AND IT'S JUST

511
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,144
PUTTING ME IN THE ANGER ROOM.

512
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,103
SO THAT'S WHY I'M REALLY

513
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:38,354
LEAVING.

514
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,273
IT'S JUST-- I WANT TO GET THAT

515
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,441
HAPPINESS BACK IN MY LIFE.

516
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,067
>> I'M JUST SCARED SHAMAR YOU'RE

517
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,319
GOING TO LOOK BACK AND REGRET

518
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:45,486
IT.

519
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,028
>> REGRET WHAT?

520
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,030
I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO

521
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:48,447
GET REQUEST BETTER.

522
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,032
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

523
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,659
OVER IN IRAQ.

524
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,993
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HE

525
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:53,202
KILLED.

526
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,496
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S GOING TO

527
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,331
THIS DARK PLACE BUT I REALLY

528
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,833
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO LOOK BACK

529
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,461
IF HE QUITS AND-- HE'S NOT

530
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,337
REALIZING WHAT HE'S DOING TO

531
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,171
HIMSELF IF HE QUITS.

532
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,048
I MEAN, THE THING THAT SUCKS IS

533
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,634
IF YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE AND THEN

534
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,177
WE END UP LOSING AND HAVE TO GO

535
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,637
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, THAT WE HAVE

536
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,640
TO THEN VOTE OUT SOMEBODY ELSE.

537
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,224
>> THAT'S THE THING IS THAT

538
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:23,148
WE'LL BE DOWN TWO IF YOU QUIT.

539
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,566
>> YOU'RE MY LADIES.

540
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,527
I FEEL LIKE IN TALKING TO YOU

541
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,195
GUYS, AND ME SAYING, WELL, I

542
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,322
RESPECT LOYALTY AND LOYALTY

543
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,198
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.

544
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,076
AND YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO

545
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,243
ME.

546
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,745
SO I FEEL LIKE I'D BE DOING YOU

547
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,329
A DISSERVICE TO JUST LEAVE YOU

548
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,997
RIGHT NOW.

549
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,499
JUST WHEN I KNOW HOW LOYAL YOU

550
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,211
HAVE BEEN ON, AND YOU GUYS

551
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,463
ACTUALLY STUCK UP FOR ME, SO, I

552
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,256
REALLY RESPECT THAT.

553
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,465
AND BECAUSE OF THAT I'LL STAY

554
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,342
AND FIGHT FOR YOU GUYS A FEW

555
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,427
MORE DAYS.

556
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,178
>> THANK YOU.

557
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,180
>> I HAD MY HOPES UP A LITTLE

>> FLIP IT.

748
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,657
>> Jeff: BRANDON VERY CLOSE.

749
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,870
TRIES TO FLIP IT AND JUST MISSES

750
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,036
AGAIN.

751
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,621
THIS CAN DO IT FOR THE FANS IF

752
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,957
HE CAN WORK IT.

753
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,419
JUST MISSES AGAIN

754
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:26,006
>> EASY, EASY.

755
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,632
>> Jeff: BRANDON IS RIGHT ON

756
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:27,799
IT.

757
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,301
THIS COULD DO IT FOR THE

758
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,135
FAVORITES RIGHT HERE.

759
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,386
BOTH GUYS VERY CLOSE.

00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,056
>> PULL!

762
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,640
>> Jeff: BRANDON HAS IT FOR

763
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:41,479
THE FAVORITES!

764
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,105
EDDIE'S GOT TO PICK UP THE PACE

765
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:42,480
RIGHT NOW!

766
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,648
>> OH!

767
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:48,028
>> Jeff: JUST MISSES.

768
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:48,653
FANS NEED TO HOOK IT RIGHT HERE

THAT'S IT.

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,219
WELL, THIS CHALLENGE WAS NECK

775
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,387
AND NECK FROM THE START BUT ONTO

776
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,639
ONE TRIBE CAN WIN.

ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

781
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,523
ALL RIGHT, FANS.

782
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,942
GOT NOTHING FOR YOU EXCEPT A

783
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,985
DATE WITH ME TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

784
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:29,736
COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE

785
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,779
THE THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF

786
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,280
THIS GAME.

787
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,657
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

788
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:33,865
CAMP.

789
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,283
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

790
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,216
TRYING TO PAT OURSELVES ON THE

791
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,676
BACK IN ANY WAY BECAUSE WE LOST

792
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,095
AND WE HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL

793
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,597
COUNCIL NOW.

794
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,767
>> YEAH, AND SHAMAR, I'M NOT

795
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,101
DISCREDITING--

796
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:05,522
>> DON'T TALK TO ME.

797
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:09,067
I SAID I HAVE CONTACT I NEED

798
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,527
THE GOGGLES.

799
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,154
YOU LOOK AT ME AND KEPT GOING.

800
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,823
THAT WAS DISRESPECTFUL.

801
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,365
I THINK THAT WAS DISGUSTING.

802
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,950
>> IF YOU NEEDED GOGGLES--

803
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:17,784
>> I SAID I NEEDED GOGGLES AND

804
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,578
YOU BROUGHT THEM DOWN AND YOU

805
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,121
TOOK THEM.

806
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,330
>> THIS ISN'T WHY WE LOST.

807
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:22,789
YOU DISGUST ME.

808
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:27,711
YOU DISGUST ME.

809
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,964
>> SHAMAR GOES OFF IN HIS

810
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,132
STUBBORN SHAMAR WAY AND CURSES

811
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,135
ME AND CALLS ME NAMES.

812
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,471
HE IS LESS MATURE THAN MY NEPHEW

813
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,764
GRAYSON AND MY NEPHEW IS THREE.

814
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,515
THIS GUY IS RIDICULOUS.

815
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,349
>> I KNOW.

816
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,226
>> JUST WHEN I THINK HE CAN'T

817
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,728
GET ANY MORE CHILDISH AND HE

818
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:44,936
DOES.

819
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,604
>> HOW MUCH DOES SHE HAVE TO DO

820
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,566
FOR THEM TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

821
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,151
LET'S JUST VOTE HIM OUT.

822
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,861
>> I'M HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

823
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,780
GOING TO START THROWING MY NAME

824
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:55,947
OUT.

825
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,283
I SUCKED AT TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

826
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,951
I STARTED DOING BACKSTROKE IN

827
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,910
THE WRONG DIRECTION.

828
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:01,536
IT WAS AWFUL.

829
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,996
THE SWIMMING PART I JUST

830
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,246
COULDN'T--

831
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,831
>> IN THIS CHALLENGE, I BLEW IT.

832
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,500
I COULDN'T SWIM AS FAST AS

833
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,585
EVERYBODY ELSE.

834
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,753
FRANKLY, IT WAS PATHETIC, AND I

835
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,087
KNOW IT WAS, BUT THAT ALSO MEANS

836
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,006
OF THE THREE THAT ARE ON THE

837
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,966
OUTS RIGHT NOW, WE NEED TO KEEP

838
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,593
REYNOLD AND EDDIE AS LONG AS

839
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,719
POSSIBLE TO WIN SOME OF THESE

840
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,554
CHALANGES THAT'S WHY TONIGHT IT

841
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,555
SHOULD BE HOPE.

842
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,098
IF THIS GAME WERE ABOUT PHYSICAL

843
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,391
STRENGTH, THEY'D BE LOOKING AT

844
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:23,558
ME.

845
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,560
>> HOPE IS A SWEETHEART,

846
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,144
OBVIOUSLY, BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT

847
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,314
THAT.

848
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,441
REYNOLD IS HARD CORE GOOD IN THE

849
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:31,733
CHALLENGES.

850
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,192
>> WE NEED THEM.

851
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:32,734
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

852
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,903
WE NEED EDDIE AND REYNOLD.

853
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,820
>> THEN THEY CAN GIVE THE IDOL

854
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,071
TO HOPE.

855
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:40,033
>> I DON'T TRUST HER.

856
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,995
LET'S SAY WE SPLIT VOTES BETWEEN

857
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,913
HOPE AND EDDIE AND THE FINAL

858
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,584
VOTE, WHEN WE REVOTE WILL BE FOR

859
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,544
HOPE DO WE WANT TO SAY GIRLS

860
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,546
VOTE FOR HOPE, BOYS VOTE FOR

861
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,714
EDDIE AND MAKE IT SIMPLE?

862
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,715
WE HAVE THREE GIRLS, THREE BOYS.

863
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,801
>> BOYS ARE VOTING FOR EDDIE.

864
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,595
GIRLS ARE VOTING FOR HOPE.

865
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,472
THEY'RE TRYING TO FLUSH OUT THE

866
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:02,680
IDOL.

867
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,266
SO WE NEED THREE EDDIE, THREE

868
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,600
HOPE.

869
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,352
IF THEY PLAY THE IDOL, THEN THE

870
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:07,769
IDOL COMES OUT.

871
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,770
AND WE KNOW WHERE IT IS.

872
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,272
>> BUT THEN THERE ARE GOING TO

873
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:11,940
BE THREE EDDIE, THREE HOPE, AND

874
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,650
THREE ME.

875
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,276
>> I AM THE ONE WHO IS

876
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,653
CONTROLLING SHAMAR.

877
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,196
I'M KEEPING HIM CALM.

878
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,532
>> ALL RIGHT, SO I JUST VOTE FOR

879
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:20,698
WHO?

880
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:20,949
>> EDDIE.

881
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,243
>> I JUST NEED SHAMAR TO KEEP

882
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,203
HIS MOUTH SHUT UNTIL WE ONE BY

883
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,746
ONE KNOCK THEM OUT.

884
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,873
REYNOLD, EDDIE AND HOPE.

885
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:34,421
HOPEFULLY IT'S HOPE TONIGHT.

886
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,132
>> IT'S NOT A GOOD FEELING ROORK

887
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,675
RIGHT, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T

888
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,300
DO ANYTHING WRONG BUT EVERYBODY

889
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,136
WANTS TO GET YOU, RIGHT?

890
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:41,761
I'VE BEEN THERE.

891
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,805
( LAUGHS )

892
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,973
>> YEAH--

893
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,268
>> IT'S NOT THE BEST FEELING.

894
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,478
I'M JUST TRYING TO ENJOY MY LAST

895
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,479
LITTLE MOMENT.

896
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,065
YOU KNOW, I'M CONCERNED I'M ON

897
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,567
THE CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT.

898
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,943
REYNOLD IS SAFE BECAUSE HE HAS

899
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:57,652
THE IDOL.

900
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,612
I CAN'T SEE HIM GIVING UP HIS

901
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,905
IDOL BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A RISKY

902
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,114
MOVE.

903
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,492
>> IF IT I WAS UP TO ME, IT

904
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,160
WOULD BE DIFFERENT, I WOULD TAKE

905
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,286
HIM OUT.

906
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:06,828
BUT HE HAS THAT NECKLACE.

907
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:11,708
TRUST ME, I WOULD MUCH RATHER

908
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,000
YOU STAY.

909
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,252
YOU'RE NOT 99% IN THE HOLE.

910
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,503
I'LL BE HONEST, I'M NOT VOTING

911
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,796
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

912
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,177
>> WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.

913
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,179
I FEEL LIKE IT'S OUT OF MY

914
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:24,804
CONTROL NOW.

915
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,265
>> YOU CAN ALWAYS THROW THE

916
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:27,474
VOTE.

917
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,227
A DIFFERENT WAY.

918
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:31,853
YOU COULD ALWAYS VOTE FOR ONE OF

919
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,272
THOSE GUYS, YOU KNOW?

920
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,857
THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO TELL

921
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,024
YOU.

922
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,275
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO

923
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:37,859
DO, WHICH WAY YOU WANT TO GO.

924
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,943
WHEN HOPE CAME DOWN TO THE

925
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,321
WATER, I KIND OF-- YOU KNOW, I

926
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:41,946
GET ALONG WITH HER BETTER THAN I

927
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,199
GET ALONG WITH EDDIE AND

928
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,950
REYNOLD, SO I NATURALLY WANT HER

929
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,329
TO STAY, AND SO-- LIKE I TRIED

930
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,748
TO GIVE HER A HINT ON WHAT WOULD

931
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,790
SAVE HER FATE.

932
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,292
AFTER YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS

933
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,335
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M

934
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:55,543
SAYING.

935
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,169
WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE

936
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,962
TONIGHT BETWEEN HER AND EDDIE,

937
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,797
SO I BASICALLY KIND OF SAID,

938
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,549
LIKE, ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS VOTE

939
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,092
UNDER EDDIE TO SAVE HERSELF.

940
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,513
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S REALLY

941
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,013
GOING TO TAKE HEED.

942
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,140
>> I TALKED TO SHAMAR.

943
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,683
>> UH-HUH.

944
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,352
>> AND HE JUST MADE IT SOUND

945
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,187
LIKE IT WAS FOR SURE THE GROUP

946
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,688
HAD DECIDE IT WAS ME OR EDDIE

947
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,398
GOING HOME.

948
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,275
>> SHAMAR TOLD HOPE THE PLAN

949
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,068
THAT WE'RE DOING.

950
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:20,902
AND THEE JUST CAME TO ME.

951
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,655
>> THE ENTIRE PLAN.

952
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:23,988
>> YEP.

953
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,074
>> NOW HE IS NO LONGER IN THIS

954
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:26,533
GAME.

955
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,201
HE'S JUST ( BLEEP ).

956
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,911
SHAMAR DRIVES ME CRAZY IN EVERY

957
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,453
SENSE POSSIBLE.

958
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,913
>> AND COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE

959
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,039
BLURBED WHAT OUR PLAN WAS

960
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,082
BECAUSE I THINK HE DOESN'T CARE

961
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,792
ABOUT THE GAME.

962
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:40,046
SHAMAR JUST TOLD HOPE THAT-- OUR

963
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:40,255
PLAN.

964
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:40,421
YUP.

965
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,965
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT BUT I CAN

966
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,967
BELIEVE IT THAT SHAMAR JUST

967
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,343
OPENED HIS MOUTH.

968
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,346
>> IF HE JUST TOLD HOPE THE PLAN

969
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,889
HE'S NOT PLANNING ON VOTING WITH

970
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:50,890
US, IS HE.

971
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,768
SHAMAR AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE

972
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:54,269
IS A COMPLETE WILD CARD.

973
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,563
>> ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT SHAMAR

974
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814
NOT VOTING WITH US?

975
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:58,147
>> YUP.

976
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,400
>> OH, MY GOD, I'M SCARED.

977
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,859
I'M IN A PRETTY ROUGH SPOT

978
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,361
BECAUSE IF THOSE THREE DO HAVE

979
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,154
THE IDOL, I'M WORRIED IF

980
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:05,947
SOMETHING WERE TO GO WRONG, IT'S

981
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,575
PROBABLY MY NAME THAT'S ON THE

982
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:08,992
CHOPPING BLOCK.

983
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:15,039
>> I CAN GET JULIA TO VOTE

984
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:15,582
SHAMAR TONIGHT.

985
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:15,832
>> RIGHT.

986
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,124
>> I CAN.

987
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:16,708
>> I'M REALLY CLOSE TO JULIA.

988
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:16,958
>> UH-HUH.

989
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:17,542
>> THERE'S THREE OF YOU AND

990
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:17,959
THERE'S TWO OF US.

991
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,626
THAT MAKES FIVE.

992
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,210
>> UH-HUH.

993
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,044
>> AND WE JUST NEED FIVE TO GET

994
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,338
THE VOTE.

995
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,382
I'M ABSOLUTELY IN.

996
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,341
TO GET SHAMAR TONIGHT.

997
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:25,883
>> YUP.

998
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,760
IF YOU CAN GAWRNLT-- IF YOU CAN

999
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,970
GET JULIA, I'M ON TEAM SHAMAR.

1000
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,848
I'M GOING TO VOTE SHAMAR EVERY

1001
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,015
DAY.

1002
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:32,223
YEAH.

1003
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,850
YOU KNOW I WANT HIM OUT.

1004
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,476
THIS GAME HAS CHANGE FLAFTD

1005
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:35,643
HOUR.

1006
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,644
THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT WHICH I

1007
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,021
HAVE A REALLY GOOD FEELING ABOUT

1008
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,105
IS THAT SHAMAR IS GOING HOME.

1009
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:43,651
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THREE FOR

1010
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:43,860
SHAMAR.

1011
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,695
YOU HAVE TO GET THE OTHER TWO.

1012
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,447
>> I'LL TALK TO THEM.

1013
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,072
>> DO IT.

1014
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,282
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.

1015
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,410
THIS COULD BE EPIC, EPIC TRIBAL

1016
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:52,869
COUNCIL.

1017
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,162
EVERY GOES AWRY TONIGHT I MIGHT

1018
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,289
HAVE TO PULL SOME CRAZY MOVES

1019
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,250
WITH THE IDOL BUT HOPEFULLY WE

1020
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,419
SEND SHAMAR PACKING TONIGHT.

1021
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:16,267
IT WOULD BE LIKE CHRISTMAS.

1022
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,985
>> Jeff: SO, REYNOLD, A LOT

1023
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,862
WAS SAID AT THE LAST TRIBAL

1024
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:28,112
COUNCIL.

1025
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,405
WAS THERE ANY FALLOUT WHEN YOU

1026
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,365
GUYS GOT BACK TO CAMP?

1027
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:30,615
>> YEAH.

1028
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,117
I DON'T RECALL ME DOING SO MUCH

1029
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,786
YELLING BECAUSE I WAS CONFUSED.

1030
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,745
I WAS SHOCKED.

1031
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,621
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

1032
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,373
BUT I HEARD SHAMAR SCREAMING

1033
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,708
FROM, LIKE, A KILOMETER AWAY AT

1034
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:40,958
EVERYBODY.

1035
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,543
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TFS ABOUT BUT

1036
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,711
ON I WAS NOT SURPRISED.

1037
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,296
IT'S PAR FOR THE COURSE FOR HIM.

1038
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,798
>> Jeff: SHAMAR, ONCE AGAIN ON

1039
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,967
THE HOT SEAT, AND ALL IT

1040
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,511
SURROUNDING YOUR TEMPER OR YOUR

1041
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:51,761
ATTITUDE.

1042
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,221
>> WELL, IT WASN'T A KILOMETER

1043
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:53,388
AWAY.

1044
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,723
I WAS YELLING AT HIM ABOUT HIM

1045
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,141
BEING UPSET ABOUT HIS PLAN NOT

1046
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:57,392
WORKING.

1047
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,687
I DON'T KNOW, MY NAME COMES UP

1048
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,104
WITH EVERYTHING.

1049
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,607
I'M LIKE THE SCAP SCAPEGOAT FOR

1050
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:04,982
EVERYBODY JUNK.

1051
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,150
>> Jeff: ARE YOU OFTEN

1052
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:06,484
MISUNDERSTOOD?

1053
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,903
>> NOT THIS MUCH.

1054
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:10,655
THESE PEOPLE PUT OUT CERTAIN

1055
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:10,947
PERCEPTIONS.

1056
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,572
WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE

1057
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,907
WHO ARE LYING --

1058
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,075
>> WHO HERE HAS LIED?

1059
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,702
>> REYNOLD HAS LIED.

1060
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,245
>> JEFF, I DON'T KNOW WHEN I

1061
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,290
LIED TO SHAMAR BECAUSE HE HAS A

1062
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,333
POLICY WHERE I'M NOT ATHROWD

1063
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:22,625
TALK TO HIM.

1064
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,335
>> BUT YOU STILL DO IT.

1065
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,087
>> Jeff: SHAMAR, YOU TOLD HIM,

1066
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,380
JUST DON'T TALK TO ME.

1067
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,923
>> BUT HE STILL DOES IT.

1068
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,508
>> Jeff: IT IS A SOCIAL GAME.

1069
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,135
>> EIGHT SOCIAL GAME AND HE'S

1070
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,302
TRYING TO PLAY THAT ASPECT OF

1071
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,679
THE GAME OH, I'M FRIENDLY TO

1072
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,722
EVERYBODY AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO

1073
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,180
TALK TO ME.

1074
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,390
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1075
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,725
DON'T PLAY THAT GAME WITH ME.

1076
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,560
I THINK YOU'RE AN EVIL PERSON.

1077
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,060
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

1078
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,228
>> Jeff: HOPE, WHAT'S YOUR

1079
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,980
TAKE ON SHAMAR?

1080
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,398
>> I SPOKE WITH SHAMAR TODAY IN

1081
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,192
THE WATER, AND HE SAID IT'S 99%

1082
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,944
SURE YOU'RE GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1083
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:50,361
>> THAT IS NOT TRUE.

1084
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,991
>> HE SAID IF I WERE YOU, I

1085
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,284
WOULD TURN ON YOUR FRIEND

1086
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,077
BECAUSE REYNOLD IS NOT GOING TO

1087
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,288
GIVE YOU THE IDOL.

1088
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,707
>> YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING HOME

1089
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,170
AND I SAID THAT'S NOT 99% TRUE.

1090
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,589
EVERYBODY HERE IS LET'S THROW

1091
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,465
SHAMAR UNDER THE BUS.

1092
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,341
I DON'T KNOW WHY I COME IN

1093
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,886
SMILING AND MAKING JOKES IT'S

1094
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,095
LIKE TO KEEP THE HEAT OFF OF ME,

1095
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,221
JUST BLAME IT ON HIM.

1096
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,433
I DON'T KNOW, IT IS WHAT IT IS.

1097
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,517
>> Jeff: MATT WHAT, IS IT

1098
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,143
ABOUT SHAMAR THAT HE FEELS VERY

1099
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,312
PICKED ON.

1100
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,980
HE FEELS LIKE, "WHY ME?"

1101
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,316
>> I THINK SHAMAR GETS A LITTLE

1102
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,942
CARRIED AWAY WITH HIS ATTITUDE,

1103
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,737
AND SEEMS TO GET AGGRAVATED REAL

1104
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:32,987
EASILY.

1105
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,238
AND I THINK HIS PERSONALITY IS

1106
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,156
JUST KIND OF RUBBING PEOPLE IN

1107
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,950
THE TRIBE THE WRONG WAY.

1108
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,285
>> Jeff: JULIA, THE ENTIRE

1109
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,788
TIME MATT WAS TALKING YOU WERE

1110
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,915
RELIVING A TRAUMA JUST SHAKING

1111
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:44,165
YOUR HEAD?

1112
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,167
>> YES, AFTER THE TRIBAL COUNCIL

1113
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,293
HE FELT ATTACKED AND WANTED TO

1114
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,171
JUSTIFY WHAT WE HAD SAID AT

1115
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,297
TRIBAL AND HE SCREAMED AT ME

1116
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,342
AGAIN, AGAIN AND AGAIN.

1117
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,092
"YOU'RE WEAK.

1118
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,844
YOU'RE A WEAK PERSONALITY AND

1119
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,930
PROJECTING IT ON TO ME."

1120
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,264
>> Jeff: SHAMAR, THAT DID NOT

1121
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:00,640
HAPPEN, EITHER?

1122
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,307
>> NO.

1123
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,308
>> AND THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE

1124
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:02,517
PROBLEM.

1125
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,977
PEOPLE TAKE WHAT I SAY AND

1126
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:05,937
EMBELLISH THEM BECAUSE THEY FEEL

1127
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,437
A CERTAIN WAY.

1128
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,980
AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT

1129
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:08,189
THAT.

1130
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,190
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1131
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,442
>> Jeff: SO FAR JUST IN A FEW

1132
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,944
MINUTE, SHAMAR, YOU'VE HAD A

1133
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,237
BEEF WITH JULIA, MATT, HOPE, AND

1134
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,487
REYNOLD.

1135
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,574
>> AND HAVEN'T TALKED TO SHERRI

1136
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,116
OR MICHAEL.

1137
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,909
>> ASK THEM.

1138
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,369
>> Jeff: SHERRI, WHY IS IT

1139
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,621
THIS ONE GUY IS TAKING ALL THE

1140
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,331
HEAT WHEN HE SAYS, "I'M NOT

1141
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:25,706
DOING ANYTHING?"

1142
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,584
>> OKAY, SHAMAR-- I'VE MET LOTS

1143
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,794
OF SHAMARS.

1144
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:30,169
I GET SHAMAR.

1145
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,338
HE JUST RUBS THEM THE WRONG WAY,

1146
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,882
AND ONCE YOU CROSS HIM, YOU JUST

1147
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,425
CAN'T GO BACK.

1148
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,176
AND THEY CROSSED HIM.

1149
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,345
IN HIS MIND, THAT'S IT.

1150
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,221
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

1151
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,390
>> Jeff: OKAY, SO, THE OTHER

1152
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,475
BIG THING GOING ON IN THIS TRIBE

1153
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,060
IS WHAT CAME OUT AT THE LAST

1154
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:47,395
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND THAT'S

1155
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,230
REYNOLD AND HOPE AND EDDIE AND

1156
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,107
ALLIE, WHO WAS VOTED OUT, BEING

1157
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,733
THIS SORT OF FOURSOME.

1158
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,985
SO, HOPE, ARE YOU CONCERNED

1159
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:54,735
ABOUT TONIGHT'S VOTE?

1160
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,194
>> ABSOLUTE.

1161
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,240
I MEAN, AFTER LAST TRIBAL I

1162
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,117
WOULD SAY I WOULD BE NEXT ON THE

1163
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,576
CHOPPING BLOCK.

1164
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,744
>> Jeff: SO IF IT'S NOT YOU,

1165
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,412
WHO WOULD YOU PUT THE VOTE ON

1166
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,914
HONESTLY, I HATE TO GO

1167
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,583
BACK TO SHAMAR BUT I JUST FEEL

1168
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,417
LIKE HE BRINGS A LOT OF NEGATIVE

1169
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,502
ENERGY TO THE TRIBE AND I JUST

1170
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,130
DON'T REALLY SEE IT CHANGE THRAG

1171
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:14,839
MUCH.

1172
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,047
SO...

1173
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,216
>> Jeff: AND, EDDIE, CONCERNED

1174
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,426
AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL

1175
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,052
THAT THEY LOOK AT AND YOU THINK

1176
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:20,553
HE'S FLIRTING WITH HOPE.

1177
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,014
HE'S ALIGNED WITH REYNOLD.

1178
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,807
HE'S TOO CHARMING, AND HE'S TOO

1179
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:24,974
FIT.

1180
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,058
WE CAN'T LET HIM LAST.

1181
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,393
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I ABSOLUTELY

1182
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,145
FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN WEARING A

1183
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,188
TARGET ON MY BACK FOR QUITE SOME

1184
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:31,772
TIME NOW.

1185
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,816
>> Jeff: DID YOU GET VOTES

1186
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,192
LAST NAME TIME?

1187
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,235
>> I DID NOT GET VOTES LAST TIME

1188
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,321
BUT SHAMAR HAS BEEN TRYING TO

1189
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,781
GET ME OUT SINCE DAY ONE WHICH I

1190
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,407
HAVE BEEN DOING TO HIM.

1191
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,452
SHAMAR HATE ME AS MUCH AS

1192
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:44,660
REYNOLD.

1193
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,621
I'M NOT ALLOWEDDED TO TALK TO

1194
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,622
HIM AT CAMP.

1195
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,165
>> Jeff: YOU'RE ON THE

1196
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:49,540
NO-TALKING LIST.

1197
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,709
>> THE REASON I PUT YOU ON THE

1198
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,793
NO-TALKING LIST IS YOU'RE A

1199
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,961
FOLLOWER TO THE REAL PERSON I

1200
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,837
DON'T LIKE.

1201
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,463
SO THAT'S IT.

1202
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,422
>> Jeff: REYNOLD, HOW BIG A

1203
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,799
FACTOR IS THE IDOL.

1204
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,301
LAST TRIBAL YOU WERE VERY OPEN--

1205
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,719
"HERE IT IS, I'M GOING TO PLAY

1206
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,262
IT TONIGHT, AND "AND PSYCHE YOU

1207
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,139
DIDN'T PLAY IT.

1208
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,933
>> YEAH, IT'S GOING TO BE A

1209
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,061
POKER GAME FROM HERE UNTIL IT'S

1210
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,980
EVENTUALLY PLAYED POUR I GET

1211
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,565

1212
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,276
IT'S A POKER GAME.

1213
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,528
>> Jeff: WITH THAT, IT IS TIME

1214
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,488
TO VOTE.

1215
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:32,124
MICHAEL, YOU'RE UP.

1216
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,381
>> THANKS FOR SERVING OUR

1217
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:38,631
COUNTRY.

1218
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:59,443
GOOD LUCK

1219
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:09,787
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THEVOTES.

1220
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,747
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1221

IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,375
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1223
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:24,468

00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,512
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1307
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,351
STRONGEST TEAM POSSIBLE.

>> YES, I SAID THAT!

1309
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,188
YES, I SAID THAT!

1310
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,773
>> Jeff: BUT NATURE PROVES

1311
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,273

DISAPPOINTED.

I DEFINITELY THINK THAT, YOU

00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,953
KNOW, I SHOULD HAVE STAYED OUT

I THOUGHT I WAS A STRONG PLAYER.

00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,209
BEFORE MY TIME, BUT I WILL SAY

1322
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,585
THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN

1323
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,795
INCREDIBLE, ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME

1324
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,087
EXPERIENCE.

1325
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,256
>> AND FEEL REALLY GRATEFUL, YOU

1326
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,465
KNOW, FOR HAVING THE

1327
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:31,840
