00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,450
JEFF PROBST:
We are in Ha Tai Yao,

2
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,619
a small fishing village on
the coast of southern Thailand,

3
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,621
in the heart
of the ancient Orient,

4
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,832
where these 16 Americans
are about to begin

5
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,959
the adventure of a lifetime.

6
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,294
They will depart
from this village

7
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,963
as a group of men
and a group of women.

8
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,840
Their destination:
Tarutao Island,

9
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>a beautiful</i>
<i>but dangerous jungle</i>

10
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,636
<i>which was once</i>
<i>a haven for pirates</i>

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the Andaman Sea.</i>

12
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,640
<i>Exotic and deadly</i>
<i>wildlife abound,</i>

13
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,601
<i>including the king cobra</i>

14
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>and the world's longest snake,</i>
<i>the reticulated python.</i>

15
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,149
<i>It is also the monsoon season,</i>

16
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,984
<i>and the island is certain</i>
<i>to be pummeled</i>

17
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,487
<i>by frequent tropical storms.</i>

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,782
<i>This will be their home</i>
<i>for the next 39 days.</i>

19
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,493
<i>They will be abandoned,</i>
<i>left to fend for themselves,</i>

20
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,286
<i>utilizing the resources</i>
<i>of the land</i>

21
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,789
<i>and their own survival skills.</i>

22
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,792
It is the ultimate challenge:
16 strangers forced

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,920
to work together
to create a new society

24
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,672
while battling the elements
and each other.

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,382
They must learn to adapt,

26
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,259
or they'll be voted
out of the tribe.

27
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,303
In the end, only one will remain

28
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,847
to claim
the million-dollar prize.

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,350
39 days, 16 people,

30
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,102
one Survivor!

31
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,483
PROBST: Let's go, guys.
Follow me.

32
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,288
Come on in, guys.
Take a seat.

33
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,124
Ladies on the left,
men on the right.

34
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,252
Welcome to<i> Survivor: Thailand.</i>

35
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,630
First thing we're going to do
is a little get-to-know-you.

36
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,132
This will be your first chance
to speak, and I'd like you

37
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,635
to share a little information
about yourselves:

38
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,220
name, age, occupation.

39
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,972
If, for some reason,
that goes against

40
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,641
your strategy of how you want

41
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,268
to play the game, then only
share what you want to share.

42
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,145
We'll start in the front left.

43
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:51,189
I'm Stephanie Dill.
I'm a firefighter EMT.

44
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,275

<i>33. Legal secretary.</i>

47
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,282
Erin Collins, 26 years old.

48
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,993
<i>I'm a real estate agent</i>
<i>in Austin, Texas.</i>

49
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,995
Helen Glover.

<i>and I'm a swimming instructor</i>
<i>for the United States Navy.</i>

51
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,501
I'm Penny Ramsey, I'm 27,

52
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,337

I'm Shii Ann Huang.
I'm from New York City,

54
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,675
<i>and I help people find jobs.</i>

55
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm Jan Gentry.
I'm 53 years old,

56
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,137
<i>and I'm a first-grade teacher.</i>

I'm Tanya Vance.

<i>and I'm a social worker.</i>

59
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,060
Let's move over to the guys--
here in the front

60
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:29,978
in the yellow.

61
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,521
I'm Clay Jordan,
from Monroe, Louisiana,

62
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,982
<i>and I'm 46.</i>

63
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,066
What's up, y'all?
I'm Robb.

64
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,317
I'm 23 years old,

65
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,195
<i>from Scottsdale, Arizona,</i>
<i>and I'm a bartender.</i>

66
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,030
Hello.
My name is Kenneth Stafford.

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,741
<i>I'm 29 years old, and I'm</i>
<i>a New York City police officer.</i>

68
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,832
Hello. I'm Brian.
I'm 34.

69
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,876
<i>And I'm in the high-line</i>
<i>world of, uh, used car sales.</i>

70
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,336
(laughing)

71
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,547
Hi. My name's John Raymond.
I'm a pastor.

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,216
<i>I'm 40 years old,</i>
<i>from Slidell, Louisiana.</i>

73
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,386
Hi. I'm Ted Rogers, Jr.,
Durham, North Carolina.

74
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,681
<i>I'm 37, and I'm a software</i>
<i>development manager.</i>

75
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,058
My name is Jed.
I'm 25, from Dallas, Texas.

76
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,352
<i>I'm a dental student there.</i>

77
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,397
I'm Jake Billingsley.
I'm from McKenney, Texas.

78
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,191
<i>And I'm 60 years old,</i>
<i>and I'm a land broker.</i>

79
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,401
PROBST:
All right.

80
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,445
In Thailand,
the elders are treated

81
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,196
with the utmost respect.

82
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,531
They are revered.

83
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,409
So I'm going to ask
the two oldest Survivors,

84
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,912
and if memory serves,
that's you, Jake, and Jan.

85
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,914
Guys, come up here.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,418
Okay.

87
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,421
First order of business:
deciding on your tribe's colors.

88
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,425
Now, in doing so,
you are also deciding

89
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,053
your tribe name and at
which beach you will live.

90
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:49,223
Now, each beach has its own set
of advantages and disadvantages.

91
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,268
At one camp, getting shelter
is going to be more difficult.

92
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:55,563
At the other camp, getting water
will be more difficult.

93
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,106
All I can tell you
at this point--

94
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,943
this beach has sunrise,
this beach has sunset.

95
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,488
Who wants which beach?

96
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,947
Sunset.

97
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,949
Sunrise. Okay.

98
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,910
We're off and rolling.

99
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,454
JOHN:<i> All of a sudden,</i>
<i>I'm, like, okay, wait a minute.</i>

100
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,705
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

101
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,248
<i>We're separated men and women.</i>

102
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,917
And I had to start thinking,
okay,

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,836
I got to put my game face on
for, you know, how do you...

104
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,297
how do you jive with just
all men in a group?

105
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,966
Your tribe: Sook Jai.

106
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,259
Sook Jai.

107
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,594
Jan, your tribe: Chuay Gahn.

108
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,638
Chuay Gahn.
(chuckles)

109
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,723
GHANDIA:<i> If we were going to be</i>
<i>an all-women tribe,</i>

110
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,974
<i>I thought that we were totally</i>

111
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,768
going to kick the men's ass,

112
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,646
'cause women are just better
at, like, multitasking.

113
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,980
We handle pain better.

114
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,816
<i>We're just more logical.</i>

115
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,860
PROBST: Now, of course,
the natural assumption

116
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,821
at this point would be
that we have a tribe

117
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,280
of men and a tribe of women.

118
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,325
That assumption, of course,
would be wrong.

119
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,744
You two are going to act
as tribe selectors.

120
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,496
Oh.

121
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,873
And you're going to choose
your own tribes-- right now.

122
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,002
Here's how it's going to work.

123
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,755
You're going to choose
one member at a time.

124
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,216
You will alternate
between men and women.

125
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,719
And you'll begin by selecting
a member of the opposite sex.

126
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,389
Jan, you get first choice.

127
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,186
When Jeff said that we were
picking the tribes, I really...

128
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,313
um, I really did
kind of get scared.

129
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,818
<i>I was scared because, um,</i>
<i>I'm not really a leader, and I</i>

130
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,988
was put in the spotlight, which
kind of frightened me.

131
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,364
PROBST:
Do you know who that is?

132
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,199
-I can't remember.
-Ted.

133
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,160
-Ted? Jan.
-Mm-hmm. Hey.

134
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,412
Jake, pick a woman.

135
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,541
JAKE:<i> It really puts you</i>
<i>on the spot, you know?</i>

136
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,044
<i>The first person I picked was</i>
<i>Stephanie, and I guarantee you,</i>

137
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,505
if you look in that girl's eyes
and then you look at her body,

138
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,174
you know that this lady is...

139
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,551
<i>is ready to take on the world.</i>

140
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,052
Jan, you're picking a woman.

141
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,721
Right there.

142
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,097
PROBST:
You picked Helen.

143
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:53,806
Jake.

144
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,894
The cop from New York City.

145
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,520
JOHN:<i> You know, initially,</i>
<i>I'm looking at what looks like</i>

146
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,730
<i>a pretty strong guy</i>
<i>and, it looks like,</i>

147
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,857
<i>sort of a weak elderly lady,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking,</i>

148
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,901
"Holy moley, I hope I get
on the strong guy's team."

149
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,652
PROBST:
Jan.

150
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,530
Um...

151
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,407
You picked John.

152
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,993
All right, Jake.

153
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,745
Plano, Texas.

154
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,414
PROBST:
Penny, now a member of Sook Jai.

155
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:21,000
Jan, who's the next member
of Chuay Gahn?

156
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:21,792
On the back.

157
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,085
-Me?
-Uh-huh.

158
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,921
PROBST:
Ghandia.

159
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,923
Jake, you're picking a guy.

160
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,592
JED:<i> Jake's demeanor,</i>
<i>I was drawn to.</i>

161
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,428
<i>You know, he picked people</i>
<i>I would also be drawn to--</i>

162
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,931
<i>the younger crowd</i>
<i>or the athletic crowd.</i>

163
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,100
I thought, "Man, I really want
to be on that team."

164
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,602
And so my heart was pumping

165
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,854
<i>when everyone was picking.</i>

166
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,107
PROBST:
Jed, Mr. Dentist--

167
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,526
you're in Sook Jai.

168
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,945
All right, Jan.

169
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,824
ROBB:<i> I didn't want to be</i>
<i>on the little old lady's team.</i>

170
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,744
Like, after I saw
who she started picking,

171
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,996
<i>I'm sitting there-- and it</i>
<i>was... it was her pick--</i>

172
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,289
<i>and I'm thinking to myself,</i>

173
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,083
<i>"Don't make eye contact,</i>
<i>don't make eye contact."</i>

174
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,794
Got to have some music.

175
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,796
-(Jan laughing)
-PROBST: Brian.

176
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,422
Come on down.
I can't sing nothing.

177
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,591
PROBST:
Comes with guitar.

178
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,051
All right, Jake.

179
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,388
Shii Ann, on the Sook Jai.

180
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,098
Jan, you're up.

181
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,182
TANYA:
<i>There's a lot of anxiety.</i>

182
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,810
<i>I think everybody sitting there</i>
<i>was thinking,</i>

183
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,979
you know, you don't want
to look like, you know,

184
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,438
that you're the last
person picked.

185
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,276
Right there.

186
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,736
PROBST:
You picked Tanya.

187
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,614
All right, Jake.

188
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,325
I want my skateboarding
buddy back there.

189
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,702
ROBB:
What's up, y'all?

190
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,662
I get to talk! Yes!

191
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,457
I love you guys, and I haven't
even talked to you yet!

192
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,500
God!

193
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,461
PROBST: Well, just like
in fifth-grade dodge ball,

194
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,504
somebody's got to be last.

195
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,006
Jan, your last choice?

196
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,507
Golfer!

197
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,510
PROBST: Clay, now a member
of Chuay Gahn.

198
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:58,222
CLAY:<i> I'm the smallest and</i>
<i>the oldest one sitting there.</i>

199
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,141
Now, I knew I was going
to be last,

200
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,726
but they got, uh,
a diamond in the...

201
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,644
in the rough's
what they don't know.

202
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,646
PROBST: Jake, pick your last
official selection.

203
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,481
All right, now!

204
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,691
(applause, whooping)

205
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,359
ERIN:
<i>You've got to be kidding me!</i>

206
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,695
I'm the last one?
Come on!

207
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,156
I can give so much
to this tribe.

208
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,033
<i>Being picked last</i>
<i>is very humbling.</i>

209
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,410
<i>I probably needed</i>
<i>that experience.</i>

210
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:23,289
PROBST: We have our two tribes:
Sook Jai and Chuay Gahn.

211
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,172
JAKE:<i> I don't know</i>
<i>what Jan was thinking</i>

212
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,507
<i>when she picked the people</i>
<i>that she picked.</i>

213
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,968
I like to see
athletic-looking people,

214
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,555
<i>so I based picking a team</i>
<i>on athleticism,</i>

215
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,391
<i>and just that gleam</i>
<i>in their eye that looks like</i>

216
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,310
<i>they'll be there</i>
<i>for the duration.</i>

217
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,854
Sook Jai, Sook Jai,
Sook Jai, Sook Jai!

218
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,024
PENNY:<i> I think Jake</i>
<i>is in great shape for being 60.</i>

219
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,108
<i>I think we probably have</i>

220
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,111
<i>the four best-looking guys</i>
<i>on our tribe</i>

221
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,614
than the other four
that are sitting over there.

222
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,366
<i>Absolutely.</i>

223
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,410
The first thing we'll do--
we'll build a latrine.

224
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,121
TED:<i> I was surprised</i>
<i>by, uh, Jan's picks.</i>

225
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,082
It seems like most
of the tribe members

226
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,459
were older members, if you will.

227
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,669
<i>The other tribe,</i>
<i>they were extremely excited</i>

228
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,421
<i>because they think</i>
<i>they'll be able</i>

229
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,132
<i>to walk over us</i>
<i>in challenges, etc.</i>

230
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,884
They're going to be surprised.

231
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,053
On board both boats,

232
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,306
identical set of supplies--
very, very meager.

233
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,102
And for food, each tribe
gets one small can of beans.

234
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,562
You are definitely going to have
to work together

235
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,730
to build your new world.

236
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,149
The day is already very late.

237
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,110
The weather
is very temperamental.

238
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,612
I suggest you get on your boat
and get out to your camps.

239
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:40,449
Look for your tribe flag
and the small fishing canoe.

240
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,700
Get out of here.

241
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,430
HELEN:<i> We figured out quickly,</i>
<i>as a team, that we needed</i>

242
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,806
to turn the boat around,

243
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,933
and the other team
didn't figure that out.

244
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,019
<i>The other team is, um,</i>
<i>quite a bit younger, and...</i>

245
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,020
<i>they're anxious little kids.</i>

246
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,230
And they just got in the boat--
paddle, paddle!

247
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,607
They were thinking it was
a race, and we knew it wasn't.

248
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,819
JOHN:
Okay, guys. Let's go.

249
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,612
-Paddles in the water.
-Go, Granny, go.

250
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,489
-Go, Granny, go!
-Right side. Right side.

251
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,116
Right side. Right side.

252
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,659
JOHN:
<i>I found it interesting</i>

253
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,120
to... to realize
that none of our team

254
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,456
understood how to paddle a boat.

255
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,291
Okay, right side.
Give us just a minute.

256
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,001
Okay, right side.

257
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,669
You paddle on the right,
you go left;

258
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,337
you paddle
on the left, you go right.

259
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,714
<i>I mean, we're turning in a big</i>

260
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,882
<i>left-hand circle here</i>
<i>and, you know,</i>

261
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,801
<i>people on the right</i>
<i>are just powering away.</i>

262
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,303
-Stroke! Stroke!
-Dig it in.

263
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,512
-Stroke!
-There we go.

264
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,514
Stroke! Stroke!

265
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,850
JOHN: All right, right side,
we're starting to turn a little.

266
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,810
-Right side, let up.
-Go a little bit easy.

267
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,687
Y'all don't have to stop.
Just go easy.

268
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,564
TANYA:<i> On the way over here,</i>
<i>you could see</i>

269
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,191
<i>who was wanting</i>
<i>to take leadership roles--</i>

270
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,026
<i>they would tell you</i>
<i>what to do-- and...</i>

271
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,360
<i>and John,</i>
<i>in particular, he wanted</i>

272
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,321
<i>to get here</i>
<i>as fast as we could.</i>

273
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,199
This team, you know,
we had a lot of the older group,

274
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,701
and, um, I'm the youngest
one here, and...

275
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,037
<i>I was hoping I would be</i>
<i>on the other tribe, actually.</i>

276
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,331
<i>I got stuck with the group</i>
<i>that I didn't really think</i>

277
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,540
I could relate to.

278
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,042
Chuay Gahn!

279
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,294
(all whooping)

280
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,550
JAKE:
<i>We didn't realize</i>

281
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,844
<i>that we were paddling</i>
<i>the boat backwards.</i>

282
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,680
(laughs)
I was steering the boat

283
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,098
<i>from the foredeck.</i>

284
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,021
ROBB:<i> And I'm, like,</i>
<i>"Our boat is backwards."</i>

285
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,524
<i>And we all started laughing,</i>
<i>and we're, like, "Who cares?"</i>

286
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:41,111
I think the thing went faster
backwards than it did forwards.

287
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,045
SHII ANN:<i> In an ideal</i>
<i>situation--</i>

288
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,589
<i>what should have happened</i>
<i>is we should have landed,</i>

289
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,133
<i>we should have hugged,</i>
<i>and we would've</i>

290
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,344
immediately drawn up
the plans for shelter

291
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,806
and started dispatching people
to do whatever.

292
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,599
-The map!
-The map.

293
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,560
-Great!
-Nice. Nice. Nice.

294
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,727
-Gully.
-Mango tree.

295
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,313
-Mango tree.
-Mango tree!

296
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,649
SHII ANN:
<i>But instead,</i>

297
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,110
we all went, you know, wild.

298
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,737
I can't believe
you're climbing a mango tree.

299
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,114
Do you see a mango anywhere?

300
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,949
Do you see anything?

301
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,409
-There's nothing.
-ROBB: You can totally swing

JAKE:
<i>Robb is a real case.</i>

305
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,835
I mean, the boy has got
more enthusiasm and energy

306
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,461

-Family!

We got a cave!

So that means our first element
was basically covered,

336
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,843
if the caves were safe.

337
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,470
What-what kind of track's
making this?

338
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,347
-JAN: What is that?
-It's a snake.

339
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,058
This may be a good place
for us to set a fire.

340
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,851
If we made it in a circle,
it will keep

341
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,144
the things out--
the animals out.

342
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,230
If there's any bats,
them things will leave.

343
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,940
Hold on, man! (laughs)

344
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,608
GHANDIA:<i> I think my whole tribe</i>
<i>was relieved</i>

345
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,110
<i>when we saw the cave.</i>

346
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,820
<i>We were like,</i>
<i>"We don't really have</i>

347
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,072
"to build anything to cover us;

348
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,574
we can kind of just
chill out in the cave,"

349
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,618
<i>which was a big advantage.</i>

350
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,661
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

351
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,080
Uh-oh!

352
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,541
-Did you go now?
-Uh-oh!

353
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,084
(laughing)

354
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,086
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, baby.

355
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,088
Oh, baby, baby!

356
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,923
JOHN: What do y'all think
about this idea?

357
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,591
What if we make sure
we do camp here tonight?

358
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,926
Just in case it monsoons,
we'll be dry.

359
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,428
-Okay.
-Tomorrow, in the daylight,

360
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,846
-we'll look for fresh water.
-We'll go look for water.

361
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,975
TED:<i> Well, we found our shelter,</i>
<i>and then along the way, we saw</i>

362
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,102
our food-- coconuts,

363
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,271
<i>coconut plants--</i>
<i>scattered about.</i>

364
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,397
There's coconuts
all over the place.

365
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,984
-That is really exciting.
-TED:<i> We also saw...</i>

366
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,487
<i>oysters and clams, etc.,</i>
<i>that we could pick up.</i>

367
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,281
-Oh, a crab!
-Ah, get it! Get it! Get it!

368
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,949
-That's a big thing.
-That's a big one, too.

369
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,659
Get him. Get his ass.
Get him. Get him. Get him.

370
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,785
-Watch out.
He's going to bite you. -I know.

371
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,120
JAN:<i> We're all out there</i>
<i>and catching them</i>

372
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,831
<i>with our finger and pick</i>
<i>them up and pull off their...</i>

373
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,625
bite... chompers and put them
in the pot,

374
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,462
<i>so we just all went out wading</i>
<i>and having a ball.</i>

375
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,755
(screams)

376
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,631
(laughter)

377
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,467
Man, we got all kinds
of food, y'all.

378
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,469
There's so much shellfish,

379
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,013
there's shellfish stuck
on top of shellfish.

380
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:40,809
We got crabs and clams
for dinner tonight!

381
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,402
Let's go to the beach.

382
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,987
(laughing)

383
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,280
Thailand.

384
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,824
-We're in Thailand, dude.
-Whoo!

385
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,327
ROBB:<i> The first night,</i>
<i>we were so thankful</i>

386
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,411
<i>the way that Jake picked</i>

387
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,331
and so excited about the team
that we ended up with,

388
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,665
<i>we all decided to come</i>
<i>down to the beach</i>

389
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,708
<i>and just check it out.</i>

390
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,337
<i>Couple people went...</i>
<i>went in there in their clothes.</i>

391
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,339
-Stephanie even got naked.
-Oh, my God.

392
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,548
-Are you naked?
-Fixin' to be.

393
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,842
ROBB:<i> She got in the water</i>
<i>and cruised around nude.</i>

394
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,386
All right. You are crazy.

395
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,348
ROBB:<i> I've never met a girl</i>
<i>that independent</i>

396
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,849
and, like, secure
with her sexuality.

397
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,976
Oh, man, you are crazy.

398
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,853
STEPHANIE:<i> I went skinny-dipping</i>
<i>last night.</i>

399
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,232
Just kind of waded out there
a little bit and dipped down.

400
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,525
You done?

401
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,528
-Madam, your clothing.
-Thank you.

402
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,530
Oh, my God. She is wild.

403
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,156
She's crazy. I mean,

404
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,158
<i>don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>going skinny-dipping--</i>

405
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,077
<i>everyone should do it, but...</i>

406
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,829
you will not see my ta-tas.

407
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,121
You look good in the moonlight.

408
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,832
-It suits you.
-Well, thank you.

409
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,543
JAKE:<i> After we kind of</i>
<i>calmed down a little bit,</i>

410
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,336
we knew that we had
to get something--

411
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,213
uh, some form of a shelter.

412
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,590
<i>We built, uh,</i>
<i>kind of a halfway shelter</i>

413
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,260
<i>that we knew we were going</i>
<i>to tear down and rebuild.</i>

414
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,886
<i>Nobody was proud of it.</i>

415
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,846
Location and everything sucks,

416
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,514
but dude,
it was so spur-of-the-moment.

417
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,890
We got the entire day tomorrow.

418
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,684
Are you sure we can all fit
in here?

419
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,185
-Come on.
-Good night, you guys.

420
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,395
-Good night.
-Good night.

421
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,563
Good night, dream team.

422
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,064
"Good night, dream team?"
(laughs)

423
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,691
Hey, where's my skateboard?

424
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,151
(laughter)

425
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,875
TED:
Hey, don't worry about it.

426
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,419
You just got to get used to
the... your stomach and stuff's

427
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,462
got to get used
to this environment.

428
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,590
I think I'm about to be sick.

429
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,223
JOHN:
<i>Tanya got a little sick.</i>

430
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,059
I think what it is
is that she just got dehydrated.

431
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,061
I don't think I drank
enough water yesterday.

432
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,230
Just, here.
Just take some. Here.

433
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,150
GHANDIA:<i> We need to stay</i>
<i>hydrated because water</i>

434
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,611
is one of the most important
things out here with the heat.

435
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,947
<i>So we decided we would all go</i>
<i>to find the water source.</i>

436
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,116
-You ready?
-Yeah. Let's do it.

437
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,076
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

438
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,996
GHANDIA:<i> We had just gone in</i>
<i>the water and started trekking,</i>

439
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,457
<i>and John, he came</i>
<i>to this crevice, and he's like,</i>

440
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,000
"Well, let's climb up in here."

441
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,628
-John, let's walk. -Well, I...
I can walk on the edge

442
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,962
along the top.

443
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,173
It's actually not a bad climb.

444
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,508
-Be careful, man.
-Uh-huh.

445
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,177
We got you.

446
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,429
You straight?

447
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,014
-I'll meet you all
around the corner. -Okay.

448
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,766
I... really,
I want to see what...

449
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,809
-what fruit trees
we have up here. -Okay.

450
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,186
And... and that sort of thing.

451
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,479
All right, John, we're walking.

452
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,314
Be careful, man. Be safe.

453
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,316
JAN:<i> We don't need to be</i>
<i>separating like that,</i>

454
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,318
<i>but some people get eager</i>
<i>and say,</i>

455
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,653
<i>"Well, we don't need to stay.</i>

456
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,655
We want to go on
and check it out."

457
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,156
You know, I'll... I'll laugh

458
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,992
if we get there
and John is there before us.

459
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,953
(laughter)

460
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,162
-See that sand over there?
-Yeah.

461
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,413
That's where we need to go.

462
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,291
-I think that's where we need
to go-- up in the jungle. -Okay.

463
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,960
HELEN:<i> Well, we thought</i>
<i>we had the map figured out,</i>

464
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,461
<i>and we thought, "Well,</i>
<i>all right, it's dumping us off</i>

465
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,587
in the middle
of the jungle here."

466
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,464
I guess we're going to have
to start scaling cliffs.

467
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,341
There's a little path, right,
and once we get...

468
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,176
this is just the hardest part
right here, Ghandia.

469
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,886
Right here.

470
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,014
Hold my hand.

471
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,182
Here, hand that to me.

472
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,517
Just stick it
in front of you, Tanya.

473
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,018
-Got it, Brian?
-Yeah.

474
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,728
-Got it.
-You all right?

475
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,730
And we might even
run into John.

476
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,357
-Let's hope.
-There's no way that,

477
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,192
if this is the water source,
that we're supposed

478
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,568
to be able to come up here

479
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,362
every couple days
with a big, huge gallon jug

480
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,197
and fill it up
and go back down again.

481
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,242
So I... I don't think
we're on the right track.

482
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,910
No, and I really
don't feel confident

483
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,495
in my rock-climbing skills.

484
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,913
GHANDIA:
<i>We came down the hill,</i>

485
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,207
and then when we got back to...
down to the bottom,

486
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,042
<i>here comes John--</i>
<i>he's back now.</i>

487
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,002
By the time I got there, I said,

488
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,086
"Well, here, let me take a look
at the map."

489
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,213
<i>And I looked at the map,</i>
<i>and I'm like,</i>

490
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,840
<i>"Okay, you know what?</i>
<i>I think maybe we need</i>

491
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,216
<i>to go around this other bend</i>
<i>over here."</i>

492
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:45,053
<i>And so Helen and I and Tanya</i>
<i>took the boat over there.</i>

493
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,889
Y'all find that water.
I'm feeling good.

494
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,350
HELEN:<i> Everybody else</i>
<i>decided they would follow,</i>

495
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,228
<i>but by this time,</i>
<i>the water had come in,</i>

496
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,813
so they decided
to come in swimming.

497
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,442
-Ghandia, are you okay?
-Yeah.

498
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,819
-It's deep water.
-Okay.

499
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,824
GHANDIA:
<i>So we swam,</i>

500
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,535
I think, maybe...
it seemed like a mile.

501
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,579
-You guys okay?
-Yeah.

502
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,586
Water hole in jungle--
wouldn't that...

503
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,920
wouldn't that be that way?

504
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,422
Well, the jungle's
all through here,

505
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,798
and there's a path over there.

506
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,218
JOHN:<i> But first,</i>
<i>we came in, and we saw</i>

507
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,137
<i>this big, ugly pool</i>
<i>of brackish water</i>

508
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,306
<i>that had been stagnant</i>
<i>and sitting there.</i>

509
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,308
<i>We're like, "Oh, my goodness."</i>

510
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,060
I don't know, Helen.
I don't know.

511
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,604
HELEN: Taste it... taste it,
and see if it's brackish.

512
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,939
-Hold my hand.
-Yeah.

513
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,274
-Just a touch.
-Here?

514
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,609
Just... yeah, just to the lips.

515
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,818
-Oh, yeah. It's definitely
salt water. -Is it?

516
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,779
JOHN:<i> So we ran around</i>
<i>looking for other spots.</i>

517
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,363
<i>Just a few feet up the trail,</i>

518
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,282
<i>there was a big,</i>
<i>round piece of wood</i>

519
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,409
<i>that indicated</i>
<i>our water source.</i>

520
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,620
It's clear.

521
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,622
Give me some skin, baby.

522
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,290
That's awesome.

523
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,298
JOHN:
<i>When they come,</i>

524
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,925
I'll say, "Come on, guys.
We found the water hole."

525
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,426
And we'll take them back here,
and we'll show them

526
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,677
the brackish stuff
and say, you know,

527
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,888
"What we're going to have to do
is filter it when we get back,"

528
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,515
-and just kind of fool them.
You want to do that? -Yeah.

529
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,682
-That's fine. -And just kind
of... just kind of keep

530
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,309
fooling them a little bit
until they notice the tank.

531
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,519
And they'll go, "No way!"

532
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,853
-And then we'll laugh it off.
-Yeah.

533
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,980
GHANDIA:
<i>And when we got in eyesight</i>

534
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,441
<i>of John and Tanya and Helen,</i>

535
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,318
I was kind of wondering why

536
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:27,489
John or Helen didn't come out
and get us with the canoe.

537
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,033
CLAY:
Push the canoe out here!

538
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,327
Retards.

539
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,621
Y'all didn't see me lose my...?

540
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,623
We're about to freaking drown
out here.

541
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,126
GHANDIA:<i> And then, when we got</i>
<i>there, John decides</i>

542
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,503
that it would be funny
to play a joke on us.

543
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,296
All we can figure
is that we can filter it

544
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,841
and then boil it, huh?
What do you think?

545
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,343
TED:
Yeah...

546
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,178
JOHN: Or maybe we can, uh,
take the lid off

547
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,347
of that tank
and get some out of there.

548
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,473
-TED: What's in there?
-JOHN: Fresh water.

549
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,309
JAN: Why don't we go that way?
Why can't we do that?

550
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,520
-That's our water tank.
-Oh!

551
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,064
-And look at how clean it is.
-Yay!

552
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,400
-Oh!
-Oh...

553
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,652
GHANDIA:
<i>I was happy.</i>

554
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,487
<i>And I was telling him,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

555
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,031
"That was really... that was
a good joke." (mock laughs)

556
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,825
<i>But then, in my mind,</i>
<i>I'm thinking that's...</i>

557
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,828
<i>it wasn't really a time</i>
<i>to joke about that just then.</i>

558
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,547
ERIN:
What are we doing here?

559
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,841
KEN:
Looks like the water hole.

560
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,344
ERIN:
Oh!

561
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,637
KEN:
I think we got water.

562
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,183
-Oh, my God.
-It looks pretty clear to me.

563
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,226
That is clear,
clean drinking water.

564
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,729
-(chuckling)
-Yeah!

565
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,646
So we don't have to go

566
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,565
to the other end of the jungle
to get it.

567
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,567
KEN:<i> Thankfully, the water hole</i>
<i>we found today</i>

568
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,069
<i>was very close by--</i>
<i>maybe 100 yards away.</i>

569
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,779
<i>The water looks clear,</i>
<i>even though</i>

570
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,615
we're definitely
going to have to boil it.

571
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,992
But it... it looks like it'll
help us out.

572
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,995
ROBB: Dude, I think...
honestly, I think we can do

573
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,205
a really good job with this.

574
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,247
Dude, this is totally
going to work.

575
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,582
-You guys know that, right?
-Yeah, that's right.

576
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,710
PENNY:<i> We spent a lot of time</i>
<i>building the foundation</i>

577
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,463
for what's going to be
our final shelter.

578
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,924
-This is going to be so nice.
-It's going to be so nice.

579
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,133
Oh, yeah,
this is going to be cool.

580
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,552
-We're going to have a good
time. -It's so soft, you know?

581
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,095
JED:<i> My tribe's</i>
<i>priorities right now</i>

582
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,431
are kind of getting
out of whack.

583
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,599
<i>Their priorities are shelter,</i>

584
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,768
<i>and no one's thinking</i>
<i>about anything else.</i>

585
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,270
<i>I'll mention food,</i>
<i>and everyone's like,</i>

586
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,147
<i>"No, I want a floor."</i>
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

587
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,857
<i>People are going to get</i>
<i>really hungry,</i>

588
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,442
and we've got
to just split work up

589
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,860
or it's not going to get done.

590
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,284
ROBB:<i> Jed, he likes to kind of</i>
<i>do, I guess, whatever he wants.</i>

591
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,120
<i>Like, he went fishing, which</i>
<i>hasn't produced anything yet.</i>

592
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,455
But, um, we really need
his strength,

593
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,040
like, when it comes
to building a shelter.

594
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,962
I'm sick of chopping, dude.

595
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,213
I've been doing it
ever since I got here.

596
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,756
Look at our hands.
Look at our damn hands.

597
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,633
I know. Exactly. I'm going
to see him when he gets back.

598
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,801
Look at his hands.
His hands are...

599
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,512
-are like he just washed them.
-I know.

600
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,103
Hey, your hand's cut.
Let me do it.

601
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,814
My hands have been cut for days.

602
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,315
I know, so why... why do it?

603
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,817
I'll do it. Just lay it out.

604
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,777
I mean...

605
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,823
ROBB:<i> The way I look at it is,</i>
<i>we're spinning our wheels.</i>

606
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,783
So many people are going
in so many directions

607
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,660
and doing stuff, and it's...
they're not producing anything.

608
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,537
Hey, Shii Ann,
if we all can start, like,

609
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,080
bringing fronds over and stuff.

610
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,124
Over here from the other stuff.

611
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,500
I was asked to go get food.

612
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,460
We need food
as well as we need shelter.

613
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,503
Look at my hands.
Let me see your hands.

614
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,130
-I understand your hands.
-Let me see your hands.

615
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,715
Dude, I was told to go get food.

616
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,717
Okay, I'm not saying that,
sweetie. Let me see your hands.

617
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,260
-That's my point, dude.
-Listen, I'm not here

618
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,386
to be yelled at by you, dude.

619
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,637
I'm not yelling
at you, sweetie.

620
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,972
I'm saying I want to sleep
tonight, okay?

621
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,640
How'd you sleep last night?
Pretty good, huh?

622
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,517
My point exactly.
Walk away.

623
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,853
I was told to go get food, man.
I can't take this.

624
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:45,687
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

625
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,355
What do...
What do you want me to do?

626
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,523
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

627
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,900
SHII ANN:<i> He is messing</i>
<i>with the wrong girl.</i>

628
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,861
<i>You do not mess</i>

629
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,739
with the Shii-Devil
and not get the horns, okay?

630
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,324
Do you want me to get food?

631
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,326
Do you want me
to get coconut fronds?

632
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,037
I sent you to get the food--
that was my decision--

633
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,331
but these guys don't want you
to do that now.

634
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,832
Yeah, it's super frustrating.
All we've been doing

635
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,083
-is talking.
-Dude, don't talk to me.

636
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,502
Babe, just help. Help.

637
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,837
On... on Shii Ann--

638
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,839
you should have come down
on me and not her.

639
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,632
ROBB: I'm trying to be rational.
I want to sleep

640
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,759
-where it's not raining.
-JAKE: Cut everybody

641
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,553
a little bit of slack.
Nobody's had a damn bit of food.

642
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:21,014
-I haven't either, man.
Believe me. -I know.

643
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,224
You got to agree with him,
though. We got to get this done.

644
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,060
That's what I'm... that's all
I'm trying to say, dude.

645
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,353
Looks like it could rain soon.

646
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,772
(thunder rumbling)

647
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,746
(screaming)

648
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,582
You see now why shelter
is so important?

649
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,932
PENNY:<i> So far, our priority</i>
<i>has been shelter, so...</i>

650
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,392
we have not eaten,

651
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,685
and I think it's starting
to take a toll on us,

652
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,063

that it's not.

653

-That's it.
-What is this?

I don't know.
I don't even know...

-"Brains and brawn."

664
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,921
"You'll all want to stay here
and experience this heaven,

665
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,425
but losing today brings
your tribe down to seven."

666
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,553
-"Brains and brawn."
-"Brains and brawn."

667
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,471
Well, we've got the brawn.

668
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,890
Uh, somebody else
has got to furnish the brains.

669
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,308
-(laughing)
-ROBB:<i> That other team--</i>

670
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,395
<i>they're definitely inferior</i>
<i>to our youth and our strength.</i>

671
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,313
We definitely got
all the hot chicks...

672
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,940
or most of them.

673
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:58,153
And we definitely got the young,
strong guys, which is huge.

674
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,951
(thunder rumbling)

675
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,870
PROBST:
All right, guys.

676
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,163
Welcome to your first challenge.

677
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,457
It is for immunity.
Now, to succeed

678
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,042
on<i> Survivor,</i>
it requires the mental ability

679
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,128
to think through
and solve problems.

680
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,297
It also requires
the physical ability

681
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,716
to execute those tasks
while dealing

682
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,092
with the unexpected, like rain.

683
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,844
First challenge--
much the same way,

684
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:27,182
it will require brawn at times,
but it will also require brains.

685
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,601
It's a race
around this small island,

686
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,519
and it begins like this:
you're going to paddle out

687
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,397
<i>through the two buoys,</i>
<i>make your way to a station</i>

688
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,483
<i>where you'll find a rope maze.</i>

689
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,817
<i>Choose one member</i>
<i>from your tribe</i>

690
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,153
<i>to move the rope</i>
<i>through the maze.</i>

691
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,530
<i>When you solve it,</i>
<i>it'll release your flag.</i>

692
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,656
<i>Retrieve it, get on your boat,</i>

693
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,658
<i>move to the next station,</i>
<i>which is simple.</i>

694
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,495
<i>A different tribe member</i>
<i>will dive down ten feet</i>

695
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,706
<i>and unhook your flag,</i>
<i>and get it on your boat.</i>

696
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:54,709
<i>The last station</i>
<i>is a traditional Thai puzzle.</i>

697
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,212
<i>You'll choose one more</i>
<i>tribe member to maneuver</i>

698
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,005
<i>the pieces around</i>
<i>until the piece</i>

699
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,382
<i>that has the knife</i>
<i>attached to it</i>

700
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,343
<i>can slide through the slot.</i>

701
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,886
<i>Take that knife out</i>
<i>of the sheath,</i>

702
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,222
<i>cut the rope--</i>
<i>that releases your last flag.</i>

703
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,599
First tribe back to me
at this platform

704
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,227
with all the flags
wins immunity.

705
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,188
And I got to show you
this immunity idol.

706
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,691
If you have immunity,
it guarantees you

707
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,901
three more days on the island.

708
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,237
Losers-- Tribal Council tonight,

709
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,572

Come on, Ghandia. You got it.

00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,725
Take a deep breath, Ghandia.

773
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,935
You got it.

774
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,399
Okay. I got to figure it out.

775
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,858
All right. Okay.

776
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,568
-Do it, baby!
-You got it. You got it.

00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,956
-You got it, baby.
-You're almost there.

784
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,416

00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,545
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa!

-Come on, Jed!
-Don't be rushing it, honey.

790
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,719
Come on, get focused. Focus.

791
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,220
You're going to beat that boy!

792
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,555
Yeah, baby!

793
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,306

794
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,563
(sighs)

795
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,693
(cheering and shouting)

796
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,486
Don't look at him, baby.
Focus on you, baby.

797
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,280
Focus on you.

798
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,157
(cheering)

799
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,119
You got it. Don't worry.

800
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,996
Row! Row!

801
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:00,997
Just keep strong.

802
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,790
-Row!
-Focus.

803
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,125
-Hurry up! Hurry up!

804
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,043

00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,633

Let's go! Let's go!

808
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,470
Got this mother!

00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,186
Get up! Get up!

811
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,191
Come on, you guys!

812
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,155
Work hard!

813
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,449
We haven't won yet. Work hard!

814
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,329
-Row! Row! Row!
-We're almost there.

815
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,830
Come on!

816
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,207
Stay focused.

817
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,294
(cheering)

818
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,298
Sook Jai wins immunity!

819
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,721
Nice finish, guys.

820
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,182
Sook Jai, nice come-from-behind.

821
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,850
You're going back to camp
with immunity.

822
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,560
Chuay Gahn, nice effort.

823
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,188
Unfortunately,
Tribal Council tonight,

824
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,148
somebody will be
the first person voted out.

825
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,692
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

826
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,367
(cheering)

827
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:36,217
-(sobbing)
-Cheer up. Cheer up.

828
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,678
We have no reason
to hang our heads.

829
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,388
-Absolutely not.
-No.

830
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,931
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

831
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,057
-Come on, you're all right.
-Hey.

832
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,892
-Everybody's gonna have a tough
day... -Hey, come on.

833
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,185
-Don't worry about it.
-It's not your fault.

834
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,687
-Look, you did your best, right?
-No way.

835
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,689
-Did you do your best?
-Yes.

836
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,440
All right, then, that's all
you can do, all right?

837
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,860
GHANDIA:<i> I'm a legal secretary.</i>
<i>I work with facts.</i>

838
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,903
<i>The fact is that we had</i>

839
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,322
a great lead,
and the lead was lessened

840
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,117
because I took too long
to figure out the puzzle.

841
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,785
-We were kicking their ass.
-We were. We were.

842
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,287
Those lucky bastards!

843
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,788
GHANDIA:
<i>So now I'm feeling like...</i>

844
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,874
that it's time
for a sister to go.

845
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,417
You can vote how you want.

846
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,127
I don't want to influence you
one way or the other.

847
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,879
You vote
however you want to vote.

848
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,089
JOHN:<i> Who's to say who's...</i>
<i>who's the most vulnerable?</i>

849
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,924
<i>Uh, but I know that, uh...</i>
<i>you know,</i>

850
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,426
<i>I think everybody's</i>
<i>pretty much thinking,</i>

851
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,927
<i>you know,</i>
<i>we need a strong team.</i>

852
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,095
<i>You know, Ghandia--</i>
<i>physical challenges</i>

853
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,513
<i>isn't going to be her thing.</i>

854
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,599
<i>Obviously, mental challenges</i>
<i>aren't going to be her thing.</i>

855
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,851
Sorry, you know, Ghandia,
but somebody's got to go.

856
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,144
Might as well be you.

857
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,979
BRIAN: Hey, take another shot of
water after that.

858
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,609
I'm about to throw up. Oh...

859
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,068
BRIAN:
It's all right.

860
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,320
-(retches)
-(splattering)

861
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,113
HELEN:
<i>Tanya, unfortunately, has...</i>

862
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,283
<i>has a shot of being voted off,</i>
<i>and I only think that</i>

863
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,202
<i>because she's had</i>
<i>a tough time out here.</i>

864
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,331
If everybody voted her off
tonight, it would be...

865
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,457
<i>because they feel sorry</i>
<i>for her.</i>

866
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,625
Even though you're saying,

867
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,293
"Don't worry,"
I mean, it is a game.

868
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,836
It's... it's a game to me,

869
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,131
and I know I haven't felt well,
and it's...

870
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,966
TANYA:<i> I feel</i>
<i>a little vulnerable, you know?</i>

871
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,761
<i>I have been sick, but I can't</i>
<i>control what my body does.</i>

872
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,471
<i>I'm still going to try.</i>

873
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,348
My vote will probably be
for John.

874
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,642
<i>From the first day,</i>
<i>a lot of the people</i>

875
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,144
<i>were upset with John</i>
<i>because he was saying,</i>

876
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,604
<i>"You're not rowing</i>
<i>hard enough,"</i>

877
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,647
<i>or, "You need to do this."</i>

878
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,607
<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>started getting annoyed</i>

879
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,233
because he was taking
a leadership role.

880
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,780
HELEN:<i> Tonight, we're going</i>
<i>to Tribal Council.</i>

881
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,073
<i>I got to vote somebody out.</i>

882
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,951
<i>I-I... I'm sick about it.</i>
<i>I don't want to think about it.</i>

883
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,369
That's like voting somebody
out of your family.

884
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:46,222
PROBST: As you walk in, grab
a torch, approach the flame.

885
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,894
Everybody dip your torches
and get fire.

886
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,523
You do this because fire

887
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,900
represents your life
in this game.

888
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,152
As long as you have fire,
you're in the game.

889
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,154
When your fire is gone,
so are you.

890
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,490
You can put your torches
back in their slots.

891
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,033
Take a seat.

892
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,916
Well, I'm sorry to say,

893
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,043
welcome to your first
Tribal Council.

894
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,212
Man.

895
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,755
At Tribal Council,
it's very simple.

896
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,299
You are held accountable
for your actions on the island.

897
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,885
Sometimes, those actions
will help you;

898
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,554
sometimes,
those actions will hurt you.

899
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,890
Before we get to the vote, let's
talk about today's challenge.

900
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,100
Great effort.

901
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,852
You guys could have won it.

902
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,729
You were in front
for a long time.

903
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,939
You get to this final station,
Ghandia.

904
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,691
-What happened?
-Um...

905
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,860
I was working it out,
and I started

906
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,903
to get anxious
when the other team's member

907
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,530
got up there
and started doing it.

908
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,408
You know, and there was a part
where I just got stuck, and I...

909
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,245
I just cried out
that I was stuck, and, uh...

910
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:54,331
a few minutes after that,
I had finished it,

911
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,250
but then, of course,
that was too late.

912
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,752
PROBST:
Do you feel responsible

913
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,587
for your tribe being here
tonight?

914
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,921
Yes.

915
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,465
Because it would have
never happened

916
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,592
if I would have finished
my task on time.

917
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,762
You know,
it's hard enough, Clay,

918
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,431
to get along with people
that you know,

919
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,810
let alone seven other strangers
in a high-stress situation.

920
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,729
How has that been?

921
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,814
Difficult at time...
I mean, it's difficult

922
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,567
anytime you walk in
and you don't know anybody.

923
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,736
First, you got
to kind of figure out

924
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,571
who these people are
and what makes them tick.

925
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,282
And, uh, where the problem is,
is when somebody steps in and...

926
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,785
and disagrees
with what goes on.

927
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,287
Then, there's where your problem
will... will come in.

928
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,914
Have you had that situation yet?

929
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,665
Uh... a li... somewhat.

930
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,917
How do you resolve that?

931
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,627
-That's why we're here.
-(chuckling)

932
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,962
We don't want to be here,
but it's...

933
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,880
-It's necessary.
-...it's necessary.

934
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,757
That... that's the way the game
is played.

935
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,593
John, what's been
the toughest part for you?

936
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,261
It really hasn't been
tough yet, you know?

937
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,430
I'm... I'm really pleased
with the teamwork,

938
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,349
the... the positive attitude,
just the spirit.

939
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,142
We have a lot
of faith on the team.

940
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,602
And, you know, I'm...

941
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,729
I guess I'm still waiting
for it to get hard.

942
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,648
PROBST:
Brian, in your profession

943
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,191
as a used car salesman,

944
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,276
do you have an advantage,
do you think,

945
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,487
in assimilating with...
with strangers?

946
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,657
No. If you judge people, uh,
by the surface

947
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,158
or just by on sheer looks,

948
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,285
then you're a very shallow
person in the first place,

949
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,830
so you got to go
a lot deeper th-than that

950
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,457
and, uh, really get to know
people.

951
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,502
And it's, uh, just...
it's all about love.

952
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,920
So it's, uh...

953
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,505
it's a beautiful thing
once you, uh...

954
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,840
once you get to know everyone.

955
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,551
And, uh, not judge the book
by its cover.

956
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,845
It's very important.
Very important.

957
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,306
Someone always has
the unfortunate distinction

958
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,350
of being the first person
voted out.

959
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:37,685
Now we're going to just find out

960
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,478
which one of you
gets that honor.

961
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,480
It is time to vote.
John, you're first.

962
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,373
Ghandia, sweetheart,
you have a killer smile.

963
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,250
God bless you.
It's a tough game.

964
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,752
Have a great vacation.

965
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,605
The only thing I can say is,
it's a financial move.

966
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,524
I think you might be a little
better off than the rest of us,

967
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,776
so maybe you don't need
the money as much as us,

968
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,945
but glad I got to know you.

969
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,381
John, you're an awesome man.

970
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,217
I just felt that there
was tension,

971
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,596
and I thought, in the long run,
it would sap us of our energy,

972
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,849
and we need to be strong
all the way without the tension.

973
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,269
I'll go tally the votes.

974
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,945
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

975
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,446
The person
will be asked to leave

976
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,114
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

977
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,200
I'll read the votes.

978
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,955
First vote.

979
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,749
Ghandia.

980
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,836
Clay.

981
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,133
John.

982
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,012
That's one vote John,
one vote Ghandia, one vote Clay.

983
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,059
Two votes John.

984
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,397
That's three votes John.

985
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,150
That's four votes John,
and that's enough.

986
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,652
You need to bring me your torch.

987
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:02,037
John, the tribe has spoken.

988
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,835
It's time for you to go.

989
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,348
Well, it's very clear to me
from you guys' reactions

990
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,850
that tonight's vote
was not easy.

991
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,685
Only three days in

992
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,021
to what will hopefully be
a very long journey.

993
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,397
Head back to camp.

994
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,815
Get some sleep.
