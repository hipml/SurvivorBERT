00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:14,097
>> JEFF PROBST: Deep in the

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,724
heart of the South Pacific lies

3
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,267
one of the most mysterious and

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,561
isolated islands in the world,

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,896
Samoa.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,898
A land that's steep, volcanic

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,193
mountains, towering waterfalls,

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:31,489
fierce rainstorms.

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,032
Rugged coastlines, virtually

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,995
untouched by civilization.

11
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,830
And surrounded by an ocean

12
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:39,456
that's home to a diverse marine

13
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,834
life.

14
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,503
Here's where these 20 Americans

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,212
are beginning the adventure

16
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,257
of a lifetime.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,258
Though they've not yet spoken,

18
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,343
first impressions are already

19
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,720
forming.

20
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,888
>> This lady with her free-

21
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,472
flowing mullet, she's probably

22
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,099
some super outdoors woman that

23
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,560
will naturally step forward as

24
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,144
our leader.

25
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,229
>> Dude, I'm a people magnet.

26
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,064
People have gravitated to me my

27
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,274
entire life.

28
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,026
It's like, "Ooh, my God!

29
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,443
This chick rocks!

30
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,905
We love her."

31
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,990
>> There's a guy who looks as

32
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:14,365
tough as nails.

33
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,284
He looks like a pit bull.

34
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:16,576
He's like...

35
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,411
I wouldn't want to mess with

36
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,746
him, that's for sure.

37
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,955
>> I plan on making it as

38
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,373
miserable as possible, making

39
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,751
it hell for everybody to get

40
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,295
what I want.

41
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,797
>> When I first started being a

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,089
police officer, I believed

43
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,175
every single person I met.

44
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,593
But now, I don't believe

45
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,805
anybody anymore.

46
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,388
>> PROBST: 20 strangers forced

47
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,349
to work together while battling

48
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,267
the elements and each other.

49
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,769
They must learn to adapt or

50
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,270
they'll be voted out.

51
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,563
In the end, only one will

52
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,856
remain to claim the

53
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,444
million-dollar prize.

54
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,279
39 days, 20 people, one

55
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,448
survivor.

56
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,316
>> PROBST: Welcome to<i> Survivor:</i>

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,694
<i>Samoa.</i>

58
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,736
You guys have already been

59
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,320
divided into two tribes--

60
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,990
wearing purple, you are Galu;

61
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,825
wearing yellow, you are Foa Foa.

62
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,076
You are now going to make your

63
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,328
first tribe decision.

64
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,204
You are going to elect a leader

65
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,373
for your tribe.

66
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,083
Out here in Samoa, the leaders,

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,168
or matais as they're called,

68
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,336
are held in very high esteem

69
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,880
because they're called upon to

70
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,463
protect the interests of their

71
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,214
tribe.

72
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,424
Whoever you elect is going to

73
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,010
do that for your tribe.

74
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,052
It's going to be based on body

75
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,138
language, observations.

76
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,139
A piece of parchment and a pen

77
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,640
for each of you.

78
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,267
Do your best to describe who

79
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,977
looks like they could lead your

80
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,353
tribe.

81
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,480
>> It's like, "Ah!

82
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,607
Kind of like a deer in

83
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,691
headlights."

84
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,734
Taking on a leadership role in

85
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,902
a game like<i> Survivor</i> is a

86
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,235
death wish.

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,029
>> PROBST: Once you have it,

88
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,405
you can head back to your mat.

89
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,239
>> I do have leadership

90
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:18,489
qualities.

91
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,491
Being in the operating room,

92
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,535
you have to make snap decisions.

93
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,703
It takes more than a note from

94
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,996
Mom to get through med school

95
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,998
and residency.

96
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,292
>> PROBST: All right, Galu, who

97
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:29,959
looks like they could lead your

98
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,127
tribe?

99
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,378
>> I voted for the guy in the

100
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,546
gray shirt with the very short

101
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,422
cut.

102
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:34,964
>> PROBST: What's your name?

103
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,965
>> Erik.

104
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,841
>> PROBST: First vote is for

105
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,425
Erik.

106
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,176
Guy in the back.

107
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:38,927
>> I voted for the lady with

108
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,844
the purple bandanna.

109
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,762
>> PROBST: What's your name?

110
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,512
>> Shambo.

111
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,597
>> PROBST: Shambo?

112
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,723
>> Yup.

113
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,432
My nickname has been Shambo

114
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,518
since '86.

115
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,478
I was in the United States

116
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,520
Marine Corps, and Rambo had the

117
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,773
same bandanna I had.

118
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,357
So everybody was like,

119
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,276
Shannon, Shambo, Rambo, Shambo,

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,570
so that's my game name, and

121
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,488
that's what I'm here to do,

122
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,573
is play.

123
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,324
>> PROBST: All right, woman in

00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,326
>> Black jacket and dreads

126
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,243
right here.

127
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:04,911
>> What's your name?

00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,788
>> That's one vote for Russell.

130
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,956
In the back.

137
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,296
Russell, who did you vote for?

194
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,149
>> Short, strong guy with the

195
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,233
hat.

196
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:18,109
>> PROBST: Short, strong guy--

197
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:18,943
what's your name?

198
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:19,527
>> Russell.

199
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,570
>> PROBST: Woman in front.

200
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,863
>> Male, gray vest, yellow

201
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,530
button up-- Jaison.

202
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,907
>> PROBST: Down here on the end.

203
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,743
>> The tall, nicely dressed,

204
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,244
Yale-type black man.

205
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,245
>> PROBST: All right, we have a

206
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:29,996
tie, now.

207
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,414
We have Mick with three votes,

208
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,207
Jaison with three votes.

209
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,334
One vote left.

210
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,130
Last vote, hold it up.

211
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,298
>> Guy with green jacket, red

212
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:40,590
shirt, Mick.

213
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,549
>> PROBST: That's it.

214
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,926
We have a leader for Foa Foa.

215
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,553
It is Mick.

216
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,721
>> I really wasn't surprised I

217
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,764
wasn't written down as the

218
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,140
leader, but I don't really see

219
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,183
anybody else that's a country

220
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,185
boy.

221
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,603
I've shot and killed and

222
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,812
cleaned about everything you're

223
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,646
allowed to in Missouri, and

224
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,105
probably a few things

225
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,523
you're not.

226
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,233
So I've done all this stuff

227
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,693
before, and I think a lot of

228
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,903
these people are kind of candy

229
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:02,904
asses.

230
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,406
>> PROBST: All right, leaders,

231
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,532
now, you're going to make your

232
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,285
first big decision.

233
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,620
And it will test your

234
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,123
leadership skills right from

235
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,917
the start.

236
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,543
>> I'm scared.

237
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,213
This leadership thing can go

238
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,589
south real quick.

239
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,841
The highest nail definitely

240
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,802
gets pounded down in this game.

241
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,678
And right now, I'm, like, sky

242
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,515
high.

243
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,064
>> PROBST: All right, you're now

244
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:38,648
going to make your first big

245
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,775
decisions as leaders.

246
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,235
You're going to decide who's

247
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,236
going to participate in our

248
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,154
opening challenge.

249
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,823
Mick, I want you to choose from

250
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,825
your tribe who you think is

251
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,243
your best swimmer.

252
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,370
>> Okay.

253
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,374
Jaison.

254
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,917
He looks like a swimmer.

255
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,877
>> Everybody assumes that tall,

256
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,838
black guy can't swim, so I

257
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,673
didn't think in a hundred years

258
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,424
that Mick would choose me for

259
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,426
the swimming.

260
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,553
But I played water polo through

261
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,012
college and the national team,

262
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,472
so I would like to claim I'm a

263
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,182
pretty good swimmer.

264
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:13,766
>> PROBST: Russell, who do you

265
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,475
think is your best swimmer?

266
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,685
>> I'm choosing the young,

267
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,146
Brazilian-looking guy.

268
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,522
>> PROBST: John, head on over.

269
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,315
Mick, pick the strongest

270
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,568
person on your tribe.

271
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,236
>> I'm choosing Russell.

272
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,362
>> PROBST: Russell.

273
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:26,779
All right, for Galu.

274
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,573
>> I'm going to choose the

275
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,782
younger guy with the short-

276
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,783
cropped haircut.

277
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,159
>> PROBST: Erik?

278
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:31,617
>> Erik.

279
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,494
>> PROBST: Mick, pick who you

280
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,414
think is your most agile person.

281
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,499
>> I'm choosing Marissa?

282
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,001
>> Marisa.

283
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,043
>> Marisa.

284
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,086
>> PROBST: All right, Russell.

285
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,129
>> I'm choosing my African

286
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:43,671
queen with braids.

287
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,298
>> PROBST: All right, Yasmin,

288
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,340
come on over.

289
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,426
Yasmin wearing nice heels.

290
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,219
All right, Mick, last choice.

291
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:50,761
Pick the smartest person on

292
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,763
this tribe.

293
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,432
>> This is tough.

294
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,057
I am choosing the woman on

295
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,641
the end.

296
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,684
I'm sorry, I lost your name.

297
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,310
>> Liz.

298
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:57,685
>> I forgot.

299
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,687
>> PROBST: Liz.

300
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,564
>> I think Mick chose me

301
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,191
because I'm Asian, and while I

302
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,692
certainly don't take offense to

303
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,526
the positive attributes of

304
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,611
being an Asian, because they're

305
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,612
smart, they're supposed to be

306
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,614
studious.

307
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,823
>> PROBST: Come on over.

308
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,199
Join your tribe.

309
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,533
>> There are also negative

310
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,034
attributes like sneaky,

311
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,703
conniving, and I just don't

312
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,704
want people attributing all the

313
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,663
negative attributes to me.

314
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,581
>> PROBST: All right, Russell,

315
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,749
who do you think is the

316
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,043
smartest?

317
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:22,543
>> I'm choosing Shambo!

318
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,380
>> Oh, my God!

319
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,716
I am smart in the ways of life,

320
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,969
but as far as book smart, dear,

321
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,096
God, please, help me here.

322
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,514
>> PROBST: Come on over.

323
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,266
>> Okay.

324
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,309
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

325
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,894
to the first challenge?

326
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,603
Here's how it's going to work.

327
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,730
On my "go," the designated

328
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,235
swimmer will swim out, retrieve

329
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,779
a key, and swim back.

330
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,572
The designated strong person

331
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,241
will use that key to unlock a

332
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,201
chain, freeing up two very

333
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,702
heavy bundles of logs.

334
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,996
You'll then carry those logs

335
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,622
back to the mat where the most

336
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,624
agile person will use those

337
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,460
logs to get up to a balance

338
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:04,669
beam.

339
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,921
You must maneuver across the

340
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,631
balance beam while navigating

341
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,176
another key through a rope maze.

342
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,387
The designated smart person

343
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,888
will use that key to unlock a

344
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,516
bag of puzzle pieces, using the

345
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,767
pieces to solve the puzzle.

346
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,520
First tribe to solve the puzzle

347
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:22,812
wins reward.

348
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,981
Want to know what you're

349
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,898
playing for?

350
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,233
>> Yeah.

351
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:27,858
>> PROBST: Fire, in the form of

352
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,694
flint.

353
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,611
>> Let's get it, guys.

354
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,821
>> PROBST: Huge advantage to

355
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,030
start this game.

356
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,323
Take your spots, we'll get

357
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,450
started.

358
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:39,787
All right, here we go.

359
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,914
Survivors ready?

360
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,336
Go!

361
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,754
The first leg is a swimming

362
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,131
leg.

363
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:50,756
Wow, two sprinters through the

364
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,384
water.

365
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,677
Got to swim all the way out,

366
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,181
retrieve the key, and get back.

367
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,725
Jaison starting to pull away

368
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,977
from John.

369
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,728
Mick feeling very good about

370
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,023
his choice for a swimmer.

371
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,316
>> Jaison, he surprised the

372
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,318
(bleep) out of me.

373
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,528
Afro-Americans aren't known to

374
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,615
be... swimmers, you know.

375
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,159
>> Jaison!

376
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,076
>> All right, come on, baby!

377
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,119
>> Come on, get it done!

378
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:20,786
Get it done!

379
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,829
>> PROBST: John now at his key.

380
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,499
(cheers)

381
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:25,875
Jaison has his key

382
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,462

He's heading back.

385
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,716
We've got a race.

386
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,008

396
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,444
Got to unlock that chain.

397
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:57,323
That is a long swim.

398
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,240
>> John shanked that swim so

399
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,742

You got it!

420
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,521
All right, get back that other

421
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,522
one.

422
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,439
Look at him-- he's strong but

423
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,315
he's tired!

424
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,316

one.

428
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,989
These are heavy bundles of logs.

00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,061
girls.

575
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,521
We can have something like a

576
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,731
secret alliance.

577
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,776
>> Okay.

578
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,069
>> Hmm?

579
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,612
>> So we can be strong from the

580
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,614
beginning.

581
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,239
We can look back at this moment

582
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,866
right now...

583
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:51,909
(Ashley laughs)

584
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,202
...and say, "We did it from the

585
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:53,744
beginning, from day one."

586
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,078
>> Right.

587
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,204
>> It is day one now.

588
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,247
I've got an alliance with the

589
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:57,790
dumb, short-haired blonde.

590
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,832
>> This is what I wanted.

591
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,416
>> Pinky swear?

592
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,668
>> I wanted someone to approach

593
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,877
me.

594
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,961
>> And the even dumber long-

595
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,962
haired blonde.

596
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:04,588
>> I'll trust you.

597
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,673
So do I have that same trust

598
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,256
with you?

599
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,507
>> Yes.

600
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,258
>> And the dark-haired girl...

601
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,259
>> You've got my word.

602
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,260
>> You have mine.

603
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,720
>> I like to call it my dumb-

604
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,805
ass girl alliance.

605
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,098
It's just gonna be me and you.

606
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:14,431
>> All right.

607
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,016
>> I told them exactly the same

608
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,017
thing.

609
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,018
This is real.

610
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,144
>> I believe you.

611
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,479
>> Not joking.

612
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,522
And I believe they're just

613
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,482
gullible enough to believe it.

614
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,775
I know this ... before I even

615
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,609
got here.

616
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,985
Align with the old lady.

617
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,320
(Betsy laughs)

618
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,988
>> You suck.

619
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,782
>> To make sure that I win this

620
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,617
game, my fourth alliance is with

621
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,660
the old lady.

622
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,120
I know she's a lot smarter than

623
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,747
my dumb-ass girl alliance, so

624
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,373
I've got to be real careful with

625
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,332
that one.

626
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:40,749
>> Should we shake?

627
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,333
Should we let people see us

628
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,752
shake or what?

629
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,879
That is fun, Russell.

630
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,131
As a police officer, I usually

631
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,674
can get a pretty good read on

632
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,342
somebody by talking to them,

633
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,969
looking in their eyes, their

634
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,470
body language.

635
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,013
I just have a feeling that I

636
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:55,597
don't trust Russell because he

637
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,349
came to me too quick in the

638
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,351
game.

639
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,061
I did make an alliance with him,

640
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,982
but I don't trust him.

641
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,868
>> Galu!

642
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,285
Welcome home, guys!

643
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,162
(cheering and applause)

644
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,163
>> Home, sweet home.

645
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,581
>> Oh, my God.

646
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,498
So, listen to this.

647
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,875
Let's make our structure.

648
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,209
I've been elected leader of the

649
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,420
Galu tribe.

650
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,255
It is a heavy, heavy liability.

651
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,299
Who's the one that you always

652
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,134
want to get when you don't know

653
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,510
who you want to get?

654
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,678
Get the leader.

655
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,721
This is almost like we're

656
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,097
building a raft.

657
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,057
Let's think about a raft, right,

658
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,143
on the ground, right, and then

659
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,478
we're going to raise the raft

660
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,437
up.

661
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:43,896
>> That sounds great.

662
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:44,313
>> So, make sense?

663
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,815
Let's get it done.

664
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,399
>> When we first landed on the

665
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,778
beach, I saw Russell, our tribe

666
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,613
leader, begin to actually take

667
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,614
charge.

668
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,032
It was really cool.

669
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,117
I felt, "Yay, we do have a

670
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,118
leader."

671
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:58,660
>> I just want to do some

672
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,414
building.

673
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,999
>> Ow.

674
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,042
>> You're going to make this

675
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:05,876
load bearing?

676
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,503
The tree isn't vertical, so it

677
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,504
isn't compressed through the

678
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,505
core.

679
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,130
>> Oh, my God.

680
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,340
They're still discussing it.

681
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,092
My only problem right now is we

682
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,136
have some really strong, male,

683
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,137
dominant personalities that

684
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,055
aren't hearing one another.

685
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:18,680
>> I mean, can we go higher than

686
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,723
this potentially?

687
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,307
I mean...

688
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,933
>> Yeah, there is no limitation.

689
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,017
>> This isn't necessarily like a

690
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,601
hard stop line...

691
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,185
>> No, no.

692
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,019
>> There's no reason we

693
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,020
couldn't...

694
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:25,604
>> Yeah, exactly.

695
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,230
I'm just sweeping this...

696
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,272
>> ...go up here and then two

697
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,399
stacks, like five and then five.

698
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,192
>> They got all hung up on

699
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,153
exactly what should be done,

700
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,780
how, when, where.

701
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,073
>> If we're going to sleep here,

702
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,157
right, and then build a

703
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,159
trench... and all the drain--

704
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,911
all the water that runs off this

705
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,495
hill, which was part of the

706
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,288
initial rationale for picking

707
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,331
this spot, right, gets diverted

708
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,333
around us.

709
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,168
In my life experience, a little

710
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,295
bit of planning has taught me

711
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,548
don't always be so quick to

712
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,549
start spinning the wheels.

713
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,550
Raw destruction.

714
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,467
Everyone's in a hurry right now.

715
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:55,717
>> I know.

716
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,343
>> We've got all day.

717
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,178
This isn't your typical

718
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,221
construction job.

719
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,305
You can't push your schedule to

720
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,807
the right, come in late, and

721
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,517
deliver over budget, because

722
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,518
guess what.

723
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,061
Your budget is coconuts.

724
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:06,520
>> Should we start...?

725
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,313
>> I think we-- it might be

726
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,523
suited to take, like, a five-

727
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,232
minute break and just really

728
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:10,816
think about what we're doing

729
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,191
here.

730
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,193
>> Oh, my God, these guys are

731
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,194
killing me.

732
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,988
John is very much all talk, no

733
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,989
business.

734
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,031
I think he's an engineer or

735
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,032
something.

736
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,743
He's, he's too technical.

737
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,579
>> I think wind needs to be

738
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,913
addressed.

739
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,206
I think rain is your biggest

740
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,207
adversary.

741
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,208
>> All he's doing is running

742
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:28,458
his mouth.

743
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,294
>> I'm trying to kind of get an,

744
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,045
get an inventory of all the

745
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,338
actions that we need to have

746
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,756
completed or at least try.

747
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,424
>> I think we ought to just act

748
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,217
and quit freaking thinking.

749
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,969
>> Okay.

750
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,305
>> Ooh, Lord have mercy.

751
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,389
>> I'm tired.

752
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,391
>> I'm going to go get wet.

753
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,019
>> Yeah, yeah, let's go.

754
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,396
>> Yeah, because I'm vile.

755
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:54,151
(laughter)

756
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:54,651
>> Oh, these young kids.

757
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,987
I didn't want to go in the damn

758
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,948
water.

759
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,532
It's crazy, because I have to

760
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,242
constantly remind myself, this

761
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,078
is not the Marine Corps, and all

762
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,705
these people are in their mid-

763
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,832
20s, so the way that the rest of

764
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,125
the tribe does things is going

765
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:10,751
to be way different than the way

766
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,544
that I do things.

767
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,296
So Russell as leader-- I-I'm

768
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,339
struggling with it.

769
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,424
He's not being assertive.

770
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,300
He's not leading right now, in

771
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,301
my opinion.

772
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,345
He needs to open a can of whoop-

773
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,304
ass and lay some laws down.

774
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:22,888
That's what I would have done.

775
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,472
That would have been my game

776
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:33,982
plan.

777
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,693
>> I lived in New Orleans, in

778
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,111
St. Bernard Parish, right by the

779
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,154
levee.

780
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,739
The storm was a category 5.

781
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,365
When it hit, it broke the levee.

782
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,784
I was in my house.

783
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,494
Me-- I have a German shepherd.

784
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,371
His name was Rocky.

785
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,498
And I tried to get out of the

786
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,791
house, and I realized I wasn't

787
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:51,458
going to make it.

788
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,336
So I grabbed my ax, because as a

789
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,420
fireman, one thing you learn is

790
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,464
when you go in something, you

791
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,341
have to be able to get out.

792
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,635
By the time I got upstairs, the

793
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,095
water was rushing in, like...

794
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,096
>> Oh, my God.

795
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,097
>> I look at Rocky.

796
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,014
You know, I couldn't even see

797
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,015
him.

798
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,599
It was muddy water.

799
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:07,891
He was gone.

800
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,142
I can't even find him.

801
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:09,726
>> Oh, my God.

802
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,312
>> Oh, my God, oh.

803
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,314
>> So sad.

804
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,066
>> I never lived in New Orleans

805
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,068
and I'm not a fireman.

806
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:18,610
I never even had a German

807
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,362
shepherd.

808
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,739
You know, I really ain't got

809
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,491
that close to another dog yet.

810
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,243
I had him for, like, nine years.

811
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,244
>> Really?

812
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:27,953
I'm such an animal lover.

813
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,580
That was so hard for me to hear,

814
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,709
and, I don't know, it just kind

815
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,876
of gets to you.

816
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,420
>> And when I got on the roof, I

817
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,171
stayed there for two days.

818
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,172
>> Really?

819
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,173
>> Two days.

820
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,425
And it's crazy how you can break

821
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,552
their hearts by telling them a

822
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:48,432
lie.

823
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,516
>> Russell is an interesting

824
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,309
character because I really

825
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,270
trusted him off the start, but

826
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:53,895
he's really been scrambling with

827
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,565
everyone, and he was trying to

828
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,442
get people's sympathy about

829
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,443
Katrina, which is probably very

830
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,571
true, and his dog, and I don't

831
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,363
want to diminish that story, but

832
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,657
I just think that it was-- he

833
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,950
was angling at stuff, and I'm

834
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:07,993
starting to feel like he's

835
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:15,584
pretty slimy.

836
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,376
>> I figure I'll make it a

837
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,544
little interesting for

838
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,629
everybody when they wake up.

839
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,006
I emptied all the water out of

840
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,507
all the canteens.

841
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,552
I plan on weeding out the weak

842
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,890
right off the bat.

843
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,391
I plan on making it as

844
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,476
miserable as possible for

845
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,603
everybody.

846
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,025
Little stuff like taking a sock,

847
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,986
I done burn it in the fire.

848
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,447
I think if I can control how

849
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,866
they feel, I can control how

850
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,743
they think.

851
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,661
I'm really a multi-millionaire.

852
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,663
I own an oil company in Houston.

853
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,623
I'm not here for the money.

854
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,709
I'm only here to show people

855
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,003
how easy it is to win this game.

856
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,923
Another accomplishment complete.

857
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,425
I'm the worst one to trust out

858
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,468
here.

859
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,137
I should be the first one to go.

860
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,181
But I'm going to do everything

861
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,059
it takes to win this game.

862
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,573
>> There's no more water.

863
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:28,990
>> None whatsoever?

864
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,034
>> No.

865
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,620
>> Yeah, they're all empty.

866
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,746
>> Oh, you know, I haven't been

867
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,789
drinking.

868
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,249
>> Somebody drank my whole

869
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,333
canteen.

870
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,209
>> Really?

871
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,336
>> Yeah.

872
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,384
>> I'm looking for my socks,

873
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,386
which I can't seem to find.

874
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,846
Gone, disappeared.

875
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,347
Me feet are starting to hurt.

876
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,932
They're a little blistered, and

877
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,892
I'd really like to find some

878
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:01,481
socks and to be warm, finally.

879
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,649
>> I don't mean to be, like,

880
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,734
pressing, but we have to hurry.

881
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,902
Because we have to fill the

882
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,820
canteens, cook some crab up.

883
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,821
>> Will you just relax?

884
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,573
>> No, I don't want to relax.

885
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,032
>> It's way too hot to touch.

886
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,325
>> it's not that hot.

887
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,119
We can start pouring it.

888
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,537
With the coconut husk?

889
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,621
>> Here.

890
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,166
>> I'll do everything.

891
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,834
>> No, Liz, Liz, you want to

892
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,710
fill the canteen.

893
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,043
>> It's hot.

894
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,378
We can blow on it.

895
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:23,962
>> You can blow on it and in a

896
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,755
smaller portion it will cool it

897
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,548
faster.

898
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,632
Use a little common sense.

899
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,468
>> My strategy is working like

900
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,387
a dream.

901
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,513
>> We have not had sleep.

902
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,681
Just...

903
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,099
>> I slept fine.

904
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,559
>> Congratulations.

905
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,269
>> And they're hollering at

906
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,271
each other right now.

907
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:41,897
And I'm going to just sit back

908
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,398
and watch them, you know, watch

909
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,400
it happen.

910
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,777
>> I just need to keep some

911
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,112
serenity.

912
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,656
>> I'll leave you alone.

913
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,909
Right now, I think I am running

914
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,410
the whole show.

915
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,329
They don't even know it, but I

916
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:09,007
know I am.

917
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,260
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

918
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,605
How you guys doing?

919
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,356
>> Good.

920
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:24,856
>> Good.

921
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,106
>> Great.

922
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,690
>> PROBST: Russell, how you

923
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,650
feeling about your tribe?

924
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,776
>> Best group of people I could

925
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,819
ever meet.

926
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,946
Everybody's pulling their

927
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,863
weight.

928
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,115
Everybody tough as nails.

929
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,158
>> Jeff, I've never read that

930
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,117
book.

931
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,577
"Things Losers Say."

932
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,995
>> That was really good.

933
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,163
That was good.

934
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,248
Can we start this, Jeff,

935
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,832
because I'm ready to open some

936
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,167
cans of whoop-ass.

937
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,086
(laughing)

938
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,420
>> PROBST: All right, for

939
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,046
today's immunity challenge, six

940
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,674
members of each tribe will race

941
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,134
across a series of A-frames

942
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,511
while carrying three coils of

943
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,553
rope.

944
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,763
You will then use that rope to

945
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,764
pull a heavy crate to the

946
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,225
finish platform, where the four

947
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,269
remaining tribe members will

948
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,104
disassemble the crate and use

949
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,647
the pieces to solve a puzzle.

950
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,732
First tribe to finish wins

951
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,818
immunity.

952
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,819
>> Hmm...

953
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,612
>> PROBST: This is the immunity

954
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,613
idol.

955
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,156
When you have this at your camp,

956
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,824
you cannot go home.

957
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,410
Tonight the losing tribe goes to

958
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,411
Tribal Council.

959
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,453
Tonight somebody will be the

960
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
first person voted out of this

961
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,372
game.

962
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,081
All right, everybody, take your

963
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,875
spots, we'll get started.

964
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,795
For immunity.

965
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,839
Survivors ready?

966
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,717
Go!

967
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,806
Galu over in one fell swoop.

968
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,975
Galu off to a huge lead.

969
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,687
Foa Foa quickly behind.

970
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,774
>> Get a running start!

971
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,860
>> PROBST: Yasmin trying to get

972
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,362
over for Galu.

973
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,073
Russell now coming down to help.

974
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,616
>> You got to climb, you got to

975
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,744
climb.

976
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,663
>> PROBST: Foa Foa now working

977
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,042
together to get over.

978
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,420
Galu has all their members over

979
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,421
the second A-frame.

980
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,883
>> Go, go!

981
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,884
(indistinct yelling)

982
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,886
>> PROBST: Galu now working

983
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,262
together, building a human

984
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:19,846
pyramid.

985
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,350
Great strategy!

986
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,560
Foa Foa is over the second A-

987
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,937
frame.

988
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:28,938
>> Go.

989
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:29,939
>> Go, Foa Foa!

990
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,441
>> Russell, grab that rope!

991
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:31,858
>> You can do it!

992
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,777
>> PROBST: This last A-frame--

993
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,528
much more difficult because

994
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,448
there is no momentum.

995
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,743
Galu is up and Galu is over.

996
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,744
>> Oh!

997
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,912
>> PROBST: Some skin coming off

998
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,038
on that one.

999
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,289
Foa Foa still working.

1000
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,500
Mick using his entire body to

1001
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:48,875
support Jaison.

1002
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,793
>> Come on, Galu!

1003
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,794
>> You can do it!

1004
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,505
>> Come on, Galu, let's go!

1005
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,589
>> PROBST: Foa Foa is over.

1006
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,590
>> Come on, Foa Foa!

1007
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,883
You got this, guys.

1008
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,469
>> PROBST: Both tribes now

1009
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,011
stretching out that rope.

1010
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,138
You've got to tie all three

1011
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,766
ropes to the heavy crate.

1012
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,892
Galu still in the lead.

1013
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,019
Go, go, go, go, go!

1014
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,772
>> Come on, guys!

1015
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,773
>> Heave-ho, heave-ho!

1016
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,150
>> PROBST: Foa Foa is back in

1017
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,151
it.

1018
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:15,944
It's a tug-of-war now.

1019
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,446
(overlapping shouting)

1020
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,739
>> You got it, you got it!

1021
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,783

Galu working well together.

1025
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,791
(overlapping shouting)

1026
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,086
Very heavy crates.

1027
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,296
>> Pull!

1028
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,297
>> PROBST: Go!

1029
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:36,965
Puzzle makers, start working for

1030
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,343
Galu.

1031
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,221
Let's go!

1032
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,222
Go!

1033
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:44,848
Puzzle makers, start working for

1034
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:49,894
Foa Foa.

1035
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,396
Galu getting a quick, early

1036
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:51,980
start on putting this puzzle

1037
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,149
together.

1038
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,442
>> All right, you guys, what we

1039
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,819
need to do is we need to find

1040
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,948
writing on the top only.

1041
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:02,949
>> "Survival," "survival."

1042
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:03,992
>> Everybody grab a piece and

1043
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,325
find your match.

1044
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:04,826
>> Yes.

1045
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,827
>> S-U...

1046
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,163

Galu absolutely nowhere on this

1050
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:13,960
puzzle.

1051
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,545
It's like they just started.

1052
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,004
This says "there..."

1053
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,881
(overlapping chatter)

1054
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,175
>> Okay, come on, we get it now.

>> PROBST: Now it's Foa Foa who

1065

seems lost.

They think they have it.

1071
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,035
Are they right?

1072
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,828

Immunity, safe tonight at Tribal

Council.

1090
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,406
Monica, I will give you this--

1091
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,866
fire.

1092
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,993
(cheering)

1093
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,330
Foa Foa, I got nothing for you

1094
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,831
except a date with me tonight

1095
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,416
at Tribal Council where one of

1096
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,585
you will be the first person

1097
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,628
voted out of this game.

1098
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,629
Grab your stuff, head back to

1099
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,630
camp.

1100
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,924
See you at Tribal.

1101
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,606
>> Everybody, listen.

1102
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,649
That's only like the first

1103
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,150
quarter in a seven-game series.

1104
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,235
>> Oh, yeah.

1105
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,236
>> You know?

1106
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:03,903
It's a long way to go.

1107
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,573
>> Today at the challenge, we

1108
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,992
lost, and that sucks.

1109
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,286
I don't know whose fault it was.

1110
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,246
I feel like, you know, we all

1111
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,080
contributed.

1112
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,833
I need to go in.

1113
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,042
>> You got to make a decision

1114
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,210
now for real.

1115
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,253
>> We got to go in.

1116
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:20,920
I don't know, I think we have a

1117
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,089
lot to think about, but I don't

1118
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,382
want to be the one to bring it

1119
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,633
up because then I'm gonna have a

1120
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,010
target on my back.

1121
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,303
>> I think right now it's a

1122
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,387
matter of strength.

1123
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,388
>> I do, too.

1124
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,347
>> I think, I think the weakest

1125
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,307
should go.

1126
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,516
You know?

1127
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,601
>> So what do you think?

1128
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,144
>> Well, weakest-wise, I think

1129
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,606
it's Ashley, just based purely

1130
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,773
on physical strength.

1131
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,067
>> Yeah, I second Ashley.

1132
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,068
>> I'm 62.

1133
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,571
I'm the oldest one out here and,

1134
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,947
you know, I do not want to be

1135
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:52,285
the first one out, you know, so

1136
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,870
I'm talking to a few people and

1137
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,121
saying that I think right now we

1138
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,123
should work on strength.

1139
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,584
Ashley.

1140
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,879
I'm going based on strength,

1141
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:03,880
weakest.

1142
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:04,714
There's going to be hard

1143
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,924
challenges ahead of us, so I

1144
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,176
think we should vote off the

1145
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,136
weakest, and I am not the

1146
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:20,855
physically weakest.

1147
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,857
>> Okay, but... but you've been,

1148
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,399
like, talking to everybody.

1149
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,068
>> I know.

1150
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,527
>> So I don't know why you've

1151
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,404
been doing that, and it makes me

1152
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,155
a little wary.

1153
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:33,201
>> Does it?

1154
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,994
>> It makes me wary, yeah,

1155
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,204
because I've seen you talking

1156
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,205
individually, like, to everyone.

1157
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,873
>> So you think...

1158
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:39,374
>> I'm just not sure...

1159
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,000
>> If I'm talking individually,

1160
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,836
it doesn't mean I'm trying to be

1161
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,213
strategizing with them.

1162
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,255
>> I'd rather keep it pretty

1163
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,256
low-key.

1164
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,174
I mean, what have you been

1165
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:48,508
talking about?

1166
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,133
>> Everything.

1167
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,136
We're out here on<i> Survivor.</i>

1168
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,763
Talking about having a good

1169
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,389
time, talking to some of them

1170
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,181
about what they think and who

1171
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:59,394
they think the weakest...

1172
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,229
How do you come to me and

1173
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,398
threaten me and telling me

1174
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,691
you're feeling uncomfortable.

1175
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,734
Are you kidding me?

1176
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,736
Marisa is the dumbest player

1177
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,737
I've ever seen.

1178
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,738
>> It is a game, you know.

1179
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,072
>> Yeah.

1180
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,199
I'm running the show here.

1181
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,742
You come up to me and threaten

1182
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,577
me, you got to go, and she's

1183
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,413
gone.

1184
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,038
She just completely threatened

1185
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,625
me, saying, "You're not making

1186
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,419
me comfortable."

1187
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,962
I said, "Why is she telling me

1188
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:26,796
this right now?"

1189
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,880
What is that going to make me

1190
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,881
think?

1191
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,049
That makes me think I got to get

1192
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,635
rid of her.

1193
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,637
>> Okay, who?

1194
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,096
>> Marisa.

1195
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,181
>> No, you think so?

1196
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,225
>> I know so.

1197
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,226
She's going first.

1198
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,227
>> Okay.

1199
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,145
>> If you stay with me, then

1200
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,229
you're going to be fine for a

1201
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,273
long time.

1202
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,900
Vote Marisa.

1203
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,152
>> Really?

1204
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,362
All right.

1205
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,530
>> My tribe will believe

1206
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,032
anything I tell them at any

1207
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,659
point because they're just

1208
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,660
stupid.

1209
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,411
I'm starting to make her

1210
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,370
nervous.

1211
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,496
Why would you say that?

1212
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,539
>> Still don't know if Marisa...

1213
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,707
All right, good, because I can't

1214
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,708
stand that bitch.

They can be my little puppets.

1221
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,175
They'll run when I tell them to

1222
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,634
run, they'll walk when I tell

1223
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,635
them to walk.

1224

1228
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,394
>> Oh, I just wouldn't.

1230
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,564

>> I-- I don't...

1323
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,446
>> Assert yourself and answer

1324
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:20,780
the question.

1325
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,322
It's not that hard.

1326
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,115
>> See, they don't like each

1327
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:23,950
other.

1328
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,533
>> PROBST: That's quite clear.

1329
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,409
>> I like Ben.

1330
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,704
I like everybody, but Marisa.

1331
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,915
>> PROBST: You voted for Marisa

1332
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:31,999
to be the leader.

1333
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,793
>> And she could be the leader.

1334
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,753
She has a very strong mind.

1335
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,171
She knows what she's talking

1336
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,215
about, she knows how to say it.

1337
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,174
>> PROBST: Clearly Marisa must

1338
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,342
have told you what to do at some

1339
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,301
point.

1340
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,886
>> She just at one point told me

1341
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,470
that she's starting to worry

1342
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,514
about me, you know.

1343
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,598
I'm walking around with

1344
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,516
everybody in the tribe.

1345
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,685
Well, yeah.

1346
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,103
Doesn't mean I make an alliance

1347
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:52,728
with everybody in the tribe, or

1348
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,022
trying to stab you in the back.

1349
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:55,564
But she just came right at

1350
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,358
me, so...

1351
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,735
>> Well, he did say to me

1352
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,195
honesty is the most important

1353
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,905
thing in this game.

1354
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,824
So if I felt worried about him,

1355
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,325
I wanted to be honest with him

1356
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,535
and share that with him.

1357
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,703
>> Well, as soon as she came at

1358
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,954
me telling me that she doesn't

1359
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:10,621
trust me--

1360
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,872
>> I didn't say I didn't trust

1361
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:12,540
you...

1362
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,082
>> then immediately I can't

1363
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,083
trust her-- immediately.

1364
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:14,875
>> I said I was worried

1365
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,418
about you.

1366
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:15,960
>> Well, that's not how I

1367
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:16,544
took it.

1368
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,545
>> She's concerned for your

1369
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,505
welfare, Russell.

1370
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,464
>> I know.

1371
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,966
>> Obviously in this game you're

1372
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,718
not safe no matter what.

1373
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,553
I would hate to go home right

1374
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,139
now, but if I did something to

1375
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,266
put a mark on my back, well,

1376
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,934
then that was really dumb of me,

1377
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,561
and I need to fix it.

1378
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,438
And I can guarantee you it won't

1379
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,648
happen again.

1380
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,482
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1381
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,567
vote.

1382
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,737
Betsy, you're up.

1383
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,899
>> If you play with fire, you'll

1384
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,984
get burned.

1385
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,843
>> PROBST: I'll go tally

1386
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,970
the votes.

1387
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,812
Once the votes are read, the

1388
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,021
decision if final.

1389
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,147
The person voted out will be

1390
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,065
asked to leave the Tribal

1391
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,399
Council area immediately.

1392
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,568
I'll read the votes.

1393
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,906
First vote, Marisa.

1394
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,577
Marisa.

1395
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,623
Ashley.

1396
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,670
Ashley.

1397
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,380
That's two votes Marisa, two

1398
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,548
votes, Ashley.

1399
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,219
Marisa.

1400
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,181
Ashley.

1401
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:34,682
We're tied-- three votes,

1402
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,601
Marisa, three votes Ashley.

1403
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,565
Marisa.

1404
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,403
Marisa.

1405
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,737
Five votes Marisa, three votes

1406
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,199
Ashley.

1407
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,617
First person voted out of

1408
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,744
<i>Survivor: Samoa--</i> Marisa.

1409
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,163
That's six, that's enough.

1410
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,664
You need to bring me your torch.

1411
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,507
Marisa, the tribe has spoken.

1412
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,936
Well, I know you don't need me

1413
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,022
to tell you how bad things are

1414
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,064
on this tribe.

1415
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,566
Hopefully, tonight's vote solved

1416
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,984
some of the dysfunction.

1417
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:27,985
Otherwise you're going to be

1418
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,153
seeing a lot of me at Tribal

1419
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,070
Council.

1420
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,155
Grab your torches, head back to

1421
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,699
camp. Good night.

1422
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,210
Stay tuned for scenes from our

1423
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,961
next episode.

1424
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,713
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1425
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,549
An epic battle fuels bad blood

1426
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,427
between the tribes.

1427
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,511
>> Listen, ignorant, why would a

1428
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,013
dude tackle me?

1429
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,556
>> PROBST: Stop!

1430
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,099
Out of the challenge!

1431
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,268
And Russell goes on the warpath.

1432
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,020
>> She's full of crap.

1433
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,104
She's going to pay for that

1434
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,232
statement, I promise you.

1435
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,281
>> Tonight's really difficult

1436
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,741
for me to swallow.

1437
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,035
I trusted Russell initially, but

1438
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,620
it was a mistake to say

1439
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,955
something to him.

1440
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,748
Because he makes trouble, and so

1441
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,458
he made it around me.

1442
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,042
And I'm really sad to be going

1443
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:25,626
home.

1444
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,126
I don't hold any animosity

1445
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,878
towards anyone and I'm grateful

1446
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,046
to have had the experience

1447
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,130
however short it may have been.
