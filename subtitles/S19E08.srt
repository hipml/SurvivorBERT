00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,168
>> JEFF PROBST: Galu making a

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,211
big move now on their puzzle.

3
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,379
Previously on<i> Survivor...</i>

4
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,715
Galu wins immunity!

5
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:07,257
Since the start of the game,

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,342
Galu has won almost every

7
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,510
challenge, and they seem

8
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,636
invincible, but cracks are

9
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,179
starting to show.

10
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,097
The four guys formed an

11
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,641
alliance and ticked off the

12
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,684
women by electing Shambo their

13
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,685
leader.

14
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,019
>> I thought the way to elect

15
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:20,562
the new leader was stupid.

16
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,229
>> PROBST: And there's a feud

17
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,064
brewing between Shambo and

18
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,065
Laura.

19
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,525
>> Clearly, she doesn't like me.

20
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:28,027
>> PROBST: On day 16, Galu won

21
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,404
yet another reward challenge.

22
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,406
Galu wins reward!

23
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,198
So Shambo stuck it to Laura by

24
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,702
sending her to Foa Foa for a

25
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,703
short visit...

26
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,704
>> All the way.

27
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,289
>> PROBST: ...and denying her a

28
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,582
once-in-a-lifetime reward.

29
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,207
>> I think it was her own little

30
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,334
way of saying, "I'm leader now,

31
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,170
and what I say goes."

32
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,963
>> PROBST: At Foa Foa, Russell

33
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,589
and Natalie immediately pounced

34
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,591
on Laura.

35
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,633
>> Natalie's doing a good job

36
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,676
talking to Laura around the

37
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,677
camp.

38
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,720
If we merge, we need somebody

39
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,804
on the inside.

40
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,346
>> PROBST: When Foa Foa lost

41
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,891
another immunity challenge...

42
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,308
Galu wins immunity!

43
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,144
... they went to Tribal Council,

44
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,437
and Russell made good on his

45
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,271
threat to knock out Liz.

46
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,565
>> You're the weakest link when

47
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,191
it comes to trust.

48
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,233
>> PROBST: Liz, the tribe has

49
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,318
spoken.

50
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,155
Outnumbered eight to four,

51
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,948
Foa Foa now needs a miracle in

52
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,033
order to survive.

53
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,034
12 are left.

54
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:28,588
Who will be voted out tonight?

55
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,589
>> So tomorrow if we got to go

56
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,590
get it...

57
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,383
As a tribe, we're down to four

58
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,301
people, so we're in a horribly

59
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,178
inferior position to the Galu

60
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,847
tribe, and so it makes our job

61
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,057
even more difficult, 'cause we

62
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,183
got to try to struggle to get to

63
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,685
a merge and then try and divide

64
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,686
and conquer.

65
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,854
Otherwise, we're all screwed.

66
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,189
>> What is that, 12 people left?

67
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,232
>> So it's a possibility the

68
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,274
next thing is a merge.

69
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,318
Yeah, when we get over there,

70
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,319
dude, the game on.

71
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,320
>> Game on.

72
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,321
>> The game starts.

73
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,073
If we all stick together and all

74
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,157
talk to somebody different, man,

75
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,700
at least one of them's going to

76
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,701
work for us.

77
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,702
>> Yeah.

78
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,787
>> You know?

79
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,246
Foa Foa needs a merge.

80
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,998
We have some strong ideas once

81
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:04,999
we get over there.

82
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,835
We plan on working as a team,

83
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:16,261
talking to different people.

84
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,720
>> There's segregation in their

85
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,472
tribe.

86
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,765
In our tribe, Foa Foa, there's

87
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,266
unity.

88
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,935
We're all working as a team, so

89
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,395
I'm not really nervous about my

90
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,437
numbers.

91
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,356
I'm too good for this game.

92
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm too sly, and now I've got to

93
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,361
make sure my seed is planted in

94
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,947
all of these dumb asses' heads.

95
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,824
So once we do merge, we can stir

96
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,035
them up over there.

97
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,162
♪ ♪

98
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,984
>> Since my return from the

99
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,694
Foa Foa tribe, seems like

100
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,029
there's definitely a lot of

101
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,113
tension.

102
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,698
I mean, clearly, Shambo doesn't

103
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,699
like me in camp.

104
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,242
And that was a huge reason why

105
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,786
I got sent over to the Foa Foa

106
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,412
tribe.

107
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,455
>> Yeah, that makes nine, and

108
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,456
that means there's one

109
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,333
somewhere, because I brought it

110
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,501
back.

111
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,127
Do you want to take my canteen

112
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,089
until we find it?

113
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,969
>> I have no reason to lie to

114
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,970
anybody.

115
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:22,929
>> I wasn't accusing you of

116
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:23,930
lying.

117
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:24,722
I was just asking where the

118
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,723
canteen was.

119
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,724
>> Laura, for two or three days,

120
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,433
you've been coming at me.

121
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,059
If you want to take a walk with

122
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,269
me so we can sort things out,

123
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,061
I'm good with that, but if you

124
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,062
don't, it's okay.

125
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,063
>> I don't need to work

126
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,064
anything out.

127
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:33,940
I don't know what's going on

128
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:34,941
with me and Shambo.

129
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:35,942
When I got sent over to the

130
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:36,943
other tribe, Dave handed her my

131
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,111
canteen.

132
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,696
I didn't care.

133
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,114
But when I came back to camp, I

134
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,115
said, "Where is it?"

135
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,157
And then, she makes this huge,

136
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,158
big deal, and then, all of a

137
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:44,701
sudden, brings up all these

138
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,036
other things that I have no idea

139
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,079
what she's even talking about.

140
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,080
>> There's some, like, little

141
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,164
power struggle going on between

142
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,749
you and I, and I don't get it.

143
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,750
I don't understand it.

144
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,793
I don't like it.

145
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,337
It's like there's this<i> 90210</i>

146
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,424
little young thing in you going

147
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,509
on, and, uh, it-it's just...

148
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,137
it's bizarre to me.

149
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,179
>> Now, how you perceive that,

150
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:05,763
if your feelings get hurt, and

151
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,514
if you're, like, "Well, what's

152
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,349
her problem?," well, that's on

153
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,350
you.

154
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,393
>> It wasn't a fight about

155
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,394
canteens.

156
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,438
It really is the way that she

157
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,481
treats me on a regular basis.

158
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,358
It's almost like those popular

159
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,818
girls in high school that are

160
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,569
cheerleaders that want to snob

161
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,487
their nose at people that don't

162
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,449
fit into their circle.

163
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,075
I'm done with her.

164
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,869
I have no use for her, none.

165
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:28,870
>> You have a way of turning

166
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,871
things about, so, like, now I

167
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,496
look like the bad person, like I

168
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,581
blew this whole thing up, like,

169
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,582
"Where is my canteen?

170
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:38,004
Where is my canteen?"

171
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,005
>> They're totally arguing over

172
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,006
nothing, absolutely nothing.

173
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,174
Totally pissed off at nothing.

174
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,550
Fantastic.

175
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,093
>> So my feeling is, so now I

176
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,094
have to suffer.

177
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,095
I'm without a canteen.

178
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:46,596
>> To be honest, we know

179
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,598
Shambo's crazy, so if you get

180
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,349
in a fight with Shambo, who's

181
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,851
the one who looks bad?

182
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:52,852
You look bad.

183
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,895
You fight with Shambo, that

184
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,229
means you're just as crazy as

185
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,272
her, only you're not really

186
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,315
crazy.

187
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,483
You're just being a bitch.

188
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,161
>> "It's time to follow your

00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,162
leader.

190
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:11,788
Face to face with your rivals

191
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,622
once more.

192
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,791
With your bodies pumped, and

193
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,209
your minds sharp, your taste

194
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,377
buds and stomachs can score."

195
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:18,920
Oh, that would be awesome.

196
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,422
>> Sooner or later, something

197
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,465
has to change for us.

198
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,591
I'm hoping today is the day.

199
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,761
We're not super confident in our

200
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,470
ability to win challenges

201
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,763
anymore, uh, but we just don't

202
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,098
want to lose any more immunity

203
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,140
challenges, 'cause the four that

204
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,725
we have is the four we want to

205
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,768
go into a merge with.

206
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,103
They're the people that we think

207
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,063
can really, really help us out

208
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,191
when we get there.

209
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,484
>> We got tree mail.

210
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,568
It's so vague, we don't really

211
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,695
know what it really means.

212
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,988
I mean, it doesn't sound like

213
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,531
the merge, but I'm pretty

214
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,574
confident it is about to happen,

215
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,493
so I have to take my immunity

216
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,537
idol everywhere I go.

217
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,205
We only have four people now,

218
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,708
but we have such a tight group,

219
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,460
so it's not over.

220
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,045
There's so much more to this

221
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,713
game than playing a physical

222
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,714
game with somebody.

223
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,299
You have to be able to outwit

224
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,300
them.

225
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,593
That's the most important thing

226
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:17,478
of the whole game.

227
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,688
>> We were going to the

228
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,689
challenge.

229
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,982
We were walking down the beach,

230
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,483
the other tribe's coming down

231
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,901
the beach towards us, and we're

232
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,945
meeting at this treasure chest.

233
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:26,612
And Jeff isn't around, so

234
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,698
everyone's kind of on edge, not

235
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,074
really sure what's happening.

236
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:37,498
(overlapping chatter)

237
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,499
(whoops)

238
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,500
>> Nice!

239
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,543
>> I'm so excited.

240
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,544
>> "Congratulations, Foa Foa

241
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,545
and Galu.

242
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,588
You are now one tribe."

243
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,589
(applause and cheering)

244
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,590
(laughter)

245
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,591
Good job.

246
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,592
>> New buffs for everyone!

247
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,137
>> "You will all go back to live

248
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,180
at the old Galu camp.

249
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,514
Take some time to get to know

250
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,515
your new tribe mates.

251
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,808
A feast awaits you down the

252
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,809
beach."

253
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,810
(screams, cheers and chatter)

254
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,687
I can't even tell you the sense

255
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,898
of relief that I felt reading

256
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,940
that it was the merge.

257
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:03,566
I no sooner got those words out

258
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,152
of my mouth that I just knew it

259
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,695
was going to be a hell of a

260
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,696
good day.

261
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,697
(screaming)

262
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,698
>> Oh, my God.

263
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,699
>> Oh... my... God.

264
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,827
(screaming, overlapping chatter)

265
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,582
>> I'm actually really, really,

266
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,334
really happy that we merged, and

267
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,587
the feast was delicious.

268
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,339
There was chicken, all seasoned

269
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,174
and roasted.

270
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,217
There were cheeses and fruits.

271
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,759
>> Look at the size of these

272
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,676
grapes!

273
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,677
>> Oh!

274
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,678
>> Mmm!

275
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,765
>> It was, like, literally a

276
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,433
feast fit for royalty.

277
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:37,850
>> To our new tribe.

278
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,727
>> To our new tribe!

279
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,728
(whooping and chatter)

280
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,356
>> To Samoa.

281
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,358
>> Cheers!

282
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,360
>> Galu-Foa Foa merge.

283
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,945
I am on top of the world, man.

284
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,947
I'm in heaven right now.

285
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,989
You guys, these are lemon

286
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:52,990
meringue mini pies.

287
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,283
>> This is what we've all been

288
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,284
talking about.

289
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,577
>> I am on such a sugar high

290
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,246
right now, I'm, like, "My

291
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:05,628
prayers were answered totally."

292
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,629
>> Uh, yeah.

293
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,672
Got a mechanical engineering

294
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,756
degree.

295
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,757
>> Congratulations.

296
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
>> Like, at first, I thought

297
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,301
"These hermit crabs are great,"

298
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:12,885
but after about seven or eight

299
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,679
days, I'm, like, "I never want

300
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,972
to eat another one of these

301
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,973
things."

302
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,015
You know what I mean?

303
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,517
>> Russell is the best crab

304
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,518
catcher, though.

305
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,602
>> Things are about to change

306
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,271
totally in this game.

307
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:23,896
The other tribe-- I don't think

308
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,856
they even realize it right now.

309
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,857
>> I'm not bad, right?

310
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,858
I'm not overbearing?

311
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,235
>> I'm looking around at Foa Foa

312
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,278
when everybody is taking that

313
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:30,903
step to do exactly what we said

314
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,821
in camp.

315
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,822
>> I'm a good snuggler.

316
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,823
>> Get with these people, bring

317
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,824
them under your wing and connect

318
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,825
with them.

319
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,618
>> It was a good day.

320
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,662
>> We're steps ahead of them.

321
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,955
We already have our plan down.

322
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:41,956
>> Cheers.

323
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,957
(laughing)

324
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,500
>> The ones I know I can trust--

325
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,042
they're doing exactly like I

326
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,295
want them to do, and it's going

327
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,798
to get stronger as we go along.

328
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,967
>> I can already see that I'm

329
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,010
the ruler in this kingdom.

330
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,011
>> Got it?

331
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,012
>> I mean, come on.

332
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,806
Who gets grapes fed to them?

333
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,976
The kings do.

334
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,698
>> This is it!

335
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,699
>> Our new home, buddy.

336
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,700
>> Welcome, you guys.

337
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,701
>> Thanks for having me.

338
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,702
>> Do y'all have a certain place

339
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,703
for bags, and....?

340
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,704
>> Now we got some more body

341
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,705
warmth, too.

342
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,706
>> That's our kitchen.

343
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,707
>> Oh.

344
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,708
>> This is what we call the

345
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,709
cutting board, or the kitchen

346
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,710
sink.

347
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,711
>> Y'all are, like...

348
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,712
The Galu camp-- I love it.

349
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,713
It's awesome.

350
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,965
I feel like I'm at the Hilton.

351
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,091
You know, at Foa Foa, we had

352
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:34,884
absolutely nothing.

353
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,970
Here at Galu, there's blankets,

354
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,305
pillows.

355
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,306
Everybody-- it really seems

356
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,307
like a family.

357
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,308
>> I'll show you where our

358
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,309
water and stuff is.

359
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,310
>> Okay.

360
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,311
Laura kind of took me under her

361
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,312
wing.

362
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,897
She was kind of like mother hen,

363
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,689
showing me around, and it was

364
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,525
really nice, because it was

365
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,860
really important for me to talk

366
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,403
to Laura to find cracks in this

367
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,529
group.

368
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,614
Make no mistake, there are

369
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,615
cracks.

370
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,199
It's just, are there enough

371
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,326
cracks and big enough cracks to

372
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,786
get the numbers on our side?

373
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,787
>> We got to pick a name.

374
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,497
Does anyone have any suggestions

375
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,498
or ideas?

376
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,499
>> Slow-mo?

377
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,917
>> Does anybody have any funny

378
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,918
Samoan slang?

379
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,960
>> Aiga is, uh, Samoan for

380
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,961
extended family.

381
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,254
>> Cool!

382
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,255
>> What is it? Aiga?

383
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,256
>> Aiga.

384
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,257
>> Aiga.

385
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,300
>> That sounds good to me.

386
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,301
>> I like Aiga.

387
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,302
>> All in favor of Aiga, say

388
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,303
aye.

389
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,304
>> Aiga.

390
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,305
>> Aiga.

391
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,306
>> Aiga.

392
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,433
>> Aiga it is.

393
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,310
>> That's it.

394
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,311
>> No, I like it.

395
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,312
>> That's all I get.

396
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,313
>> Foa Foa-- the only thing that

397
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,606
they have going for them is they

398
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,273
have a new beach, and they have

399
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,942
new people to talk to.

400
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,943
They're starting over.

401
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,944
They're on day two.

402
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,945
I'm on day 19.

403
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,279
I have the hidden immunity idol.

404
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,614
It's in my pocket.

405
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,782
And that's power in this game.

406
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,825
And they think that they're

407
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,992
going to strategize and make

408
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,327
friends, and la-la-la, we're an

409
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:43,911
extended family.

410
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,955
Like, the name of our tribe,

411
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:46,956
Aiga, means extended family.

412
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,458
Ugh!

413
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,459
(laughter)

414
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,460
Extended family?

415
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,128
What's Samoan for "Get the hell

416
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,879
off my island?"

417
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,434
>> I definitely have tricks up

418
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,435
my sleeve.

419
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,019
Day one at Foa Foa, I was very

420
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,020
aggressive.

421
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,397
I went to everybody right off

422
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,066
the bat, and my plan happened.

423
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,359
It happened like I wanted to.

424
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,610
Over here, I'm going to go to

425
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,446
people, saying the same things,

426
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,071
doing exactly the same strategy,

427
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,032
but I have the idol to be able

428
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,493
to make them sway my way.

429
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,204
>> Obviously, I didn't find this

430
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,541
on the beach.

431
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,917
It's the real deal.

432
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,002
Now, if you could take me to the

433
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:38,841
top seven, I'll hand it to you.

434
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,801
I'll give it to you.

435
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,178
I swear I will.

436
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,305
>> Okay.

437
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,391
>> Nobody.

438
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,434
Everything's between me and you.

439
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,435
>> Okay. So top seven?

440
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,769
>> Top seven, I'll hand it to

441
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,770
you.

442
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,771
>> I can't believe Russell

443
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,772
showed me he had the idol.

444
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,774
But you know what?

445
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,774
Desperate people do desperate

446
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,775
things.

447
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,776
I don't believe he would give

448
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,777
that to me, but just knowing

449
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,820
that he has it is huge, which

450
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,322
means when we do get rid of

451
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:01,947
him, it's going to have to be a

452
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,824
big blindside.

453
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,951
>> There's a few rules that I

454
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,495
want to put in place with this

455
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,496
deal.

456
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,038
You can get rid of my guys

457
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,373
whenever you want, but the first

458
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,667
one to go has to be one of your

459
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,668
guys.

460
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,669
>> That won't happen.

461
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,670
>> You don't think?

462
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,671
>> That won't happen.

463
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,964
>> Who do you want the first one

464
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,007
to go, one of my guys?

465
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,966
>> It'll be one of your guys or

466
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,967
Shambo.

467
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,968
>> Right.

468
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:23,969
>> It's kind of funny.

469
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:24,970
Russell came to me with this

470
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:25,971
attitude of, like...

471
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,264
"I'm the boss, and here's some

472
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,265
rules," he tells me.

473
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,476
And I'm, like, "Okay, well, just

474
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,102
so you know, I kind of hold all

475
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,395
the cards right now, and, um,

476
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:33,979
you just need to try and stay

477
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:34,980
alive."

478
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,233
You're in a worse position than

479
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,234
myself at this point.

480
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,276
You're coming here with ten

481
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,277
percent.

482
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,278
I got 90.

483
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,279
>> Right.

484
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,030
Laura's digging her own grave.

485
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,449
She told me, "I'm 90% in charge

486
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,450
of this, Russell.

487
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,493
You're about ten percent right

488
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,494
now."

489
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,787
In other words, sit down and

490
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,788
listen.

491
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,789
No.

492
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,290
It don't work like that for me.

493
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,291
Okay.

494
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,626
She might be the first to go.

495
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,252
All right, well, I'm just going

496
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,420
to try to win them all, then.

497
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,421
(Laura laughs)

498
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,464
What else can I do?

499
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,590
I went to Laura.

500
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,132
I thought it wasn't going to

501
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,843
really work, so I'm going to do

502
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,427
the same thing with somebody

503
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:05,886
else.

504
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,055
Maybe, uh... uh...

505
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:32,496
Monica.

506
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,122
>> ...I would give this to you

507
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,123
and let you use it.

508
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,124
>> I'm in.

509
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,125
>> Okay.

510
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,544
This has to stay between me and

511
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,545
you...

512
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,546
>> Absolutely.

513
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,547
>> ...or this won't work.

514
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,299
Monica didn't mean a word she

515
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,842
said over there on the rocks.

516
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,635
I see it in her eyes, but she

517
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,137
might actually start meaning

518
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,723
what she tells me if I get rid

519
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,890
of her boss.

520
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,225
I get rid of Laura, she comes

521
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,226
a-runnin'.

522
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,894
Now, if we can get one of the

523
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,478
guys on my side, that would be

524
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,314
gold.

525
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,773
I'll get rid of Laura one way

526
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,025
or the other.

527
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,283
>> That's crazy.

528
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,076
>> I got it with no clue.

529
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,077
>> That is impressive, bro.

530
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,289
>> I'm telling you, dude, we can

531
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,832
be in control of this game

532
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:17,833
without them even knowing.

533
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,834
I can convince my people to vote

534
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:19,835
whoever I say.

535
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:20,377
I know you can do the same.

536
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:20,961
>> Mm-hmm. Right.

537
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,005
>> Dude, I swear, if I think

538
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,632
your butt's on the line, I don't

539
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,008
have a problem giving it to you,

540
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,051
and letting you use it.

541
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,052
>> And then we'll keep driving

542
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,179
it, yeah.

543
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,182
>> You're the only one here that

544
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,183
can do it with me.

545
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,185
I see that.

546
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,019
>> Russell divulged to me that

547
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,480
he had the hidden immunity idol.

548
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,022
I think because Russell's an

549
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,066
aggressive player, and he

550
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,859
realizes that maybe having a

551
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:44,860
relationship with someone like

552
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:45,444
me is something that could be

553
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,196
very, very beneficial to him in

554
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,197
this game.

555
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,239
>> Do you think Laura is

556
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,199
trustworthy?

557
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,200
>> What do you think?

558
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:51,992
>> I think she should go first,

559
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,411
'cause once she's gone, the girl

560
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,412
power is over.

561
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,413
>> Yeah.

562
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,082
Laura and Monica have a

563
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,041
relationship that is potentially

564
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,918
dangerous.

565
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,336
And even though it's going to be

566
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,921
viewed as a big move, I think

567
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,546
it's a manageable risk to vote

568
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,674
off Laura first, while we have

569
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,676
votes from the other tribe.

570
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,968
>> My guys are going to vote

571
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:10,969
Laura.

572
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:11,970
Right.

573
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:12,471
>> Then I'll go get some

574
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,013
cavalry.

575
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,014
That's crazy, bro.

576
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,016
>> And then it could be me and

577
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,017
you at the end.

578
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,018
>> That is crazy.

579
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,645
>> Me and John could be a good

580
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,855
team, I believe.

581
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,440
He's smart enough to know what's

582
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,983
going on, so things are going to

583
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,110
get crazy tomorrow out here.

584
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,990
>> All right.

585
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,991
>> We're going to turn this game

586
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,992
on its side.

587
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:34,702
>> Hey.

588
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,703
>> Shake your hand as a man.

589
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,704
>> Absolutely.

590
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,705
>> This is... I'm a...

591
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,706
I'll be...

592
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,707
I'll honor what I say right now.

593
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,708
>> Absolutely.

594
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,084
>> You ever heard of a man named

595
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,252
Babe Ruth?

596
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,712
He struck out more than anybody

597
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,087
ever.

598
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,046
But you know what?

599
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,090
He also hit the most homeruns,

600
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,259
so that tells me one thing.

601
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,260
Keep swinging, baby.

602
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,302
Eventually, you're going to hit

603
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,303
one.

604
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,140
(laughs)

605
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,788
>> No, I'm using a-a snail.

606
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,831
Shambo's a really good person,

607
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,832
and we do connect.

608
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,667
I think it has a lot to do with

609
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,668
my Southern background.

610
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,669
People trust the South.

611
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,129
So she could be one of my

612
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,130
numbers.

613
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,882
I mean, I could use her for

614
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,009
that.

615
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,805
>> Of course I am.

616
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
Knowing what a little spiteful

617
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,933
snake she is.

618
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,935
She's half the battle.

619
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,103
>> We got in quite the little

620
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,104
scene.

621
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,647
She was just being a bitch to

622
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,648
me.

623
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,317
I said, "What is your problem?

624
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,444
You've been very, very

625
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,570
mean-spirited and just, you

626
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,071
know, awful to me."

627
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,239
>> Wow.

628
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,575
Shambo hates Laura.

629
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,826
She hates her.

630
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,369
So I know at any point, she'll

631
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,580
vote Laura's name.

632
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,876
You know, get rid of a strong

633
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:06,502
player, Laura, and get rid of

634
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,169
the snake.

635
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,547
>> I trust Russell implicitly.

636
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,840
The guy is definitely cut from

637
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,883
the same cloth as me.

638
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,051
He's a country boy.

639
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:14,510
I'm a country girl.

640
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
And he just keeps bringing up

641
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,597
that Laura needs to go first.

642
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,890
She's the bane of my existence

643
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:20,349
in Samoa.

644
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,768
So, it's not like we need this

645
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,520
multi-layered plot.

646
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,687
Write Laura's name down tonight.

647
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,688
It's that simple.

648
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,273
You need to make sure that you

649
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,274
have the conversation.

650
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,820
Pull Jaison off to the side.

651
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,655
>> Pull Mick off to the side.

652
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,951
>> Pull Natalie off to the side.

653
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,411
>> And tell them, "No matter

654
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,246
what, Laura is the only name we

655
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,247
are writing down." Okay?

656
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,331
>> Sounds good to me.

657
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,332
>> Outstanding. Carry on.

658
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,209
>> It was easy to control these

659
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,211
minds.

660
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,338
Way easier than I thought.

661
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,173
John's on board, and I have

662
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,174
Shambo in my pocket.

663
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,385
So if we can get rid of Laura,

664
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,596
this whole game might change.

665
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,436
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

666
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:15,571
You have now merged into one

667
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,363
tribe.

668
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,364
It's a completely different

669
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,365
game.

670
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,784
You guys ready to get to today's

671
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,785
challenge?

672
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,786
>> Let's do it.

673
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,787
>> Yeah.

674
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,830
>> Dave, I'll take back tribal

675
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,624
immunity.

676
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,793
Now that you're merged into one

677
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,295
tribe, tribal immunity is no

678
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,380
more.

679
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,923
Individual immunity is what you

680
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,425
covet.

681
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,301
When you are wearing this, you

682
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,343
are safe at Tribal Council.

683
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,386
Let's get to the challenge.

684
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,429
Today, you'll participate in a

685
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,430
game of good, old-fashioned

686
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>Survivor</i> T-ball.

687
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,432
It's very simple.

688
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,433
>> Sweet!

689
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,476
>> PROBST: One at a time, you'll

690
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,270
place your ball on the tee, take

691
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,438
a swing.

692
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,939
Whatever section your ball lands

693
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,232
in, you score that many points.

694
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,570
Highest score wins immunity.

695
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,281
And for today's challenge...

696
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,491
there are two necklaces.

697
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,534
(low whistles)

698
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,994
>> PROBST: Because two people

699
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:04,995
will win immunity.

700
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,537
The women will take on the

701
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,330
women.

702
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,331
The winner gets immunity.

703
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,625
The men will take on the men.

704
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,626
The winner gets immunity.

705
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,627
Make sense?

706
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,628
>> Yes.

707
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,629
>> Mm-hmm.

708
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,963
>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots.

709
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,966
We'll get started.

710
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,550
Dave Ball, you're first up for

711
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,343
the men.

712
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,344
>> Let's go, Dave.

713
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,345
>> Go, Dave.

714
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,346
>> Let's go, Danger Dave.

715
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,473
>> Ugh!

716
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,474
>> PROBST: Danger Dave.

717
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,935
Baseball your sport?

718
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,353
>> Uh, no, making love's my

719
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,354
sport.

720
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,439
(laughter)

721
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,566
>> PROBST: You play a lot?

722
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,567
>> Not often enough.

723
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,195
(laughter)

724
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,237
>> Geez.

725
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,238
>> Let's go, Dave.

726
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,240
That a boy.

727
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:41,698
>> PROBST: Nice swing.

728
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,449
Where's it going to drop?

729
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,450
>> There you go!

730
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,409
>> PROBST: Pops into the three.

731
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,328
>> Go, Dave.

732
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,329
>> PROBST: Not a bad score.

733
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,330
>> Dave-O.

734
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,331
>> Good job, Dave.

735
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,917
>> PROBST: Jaison now up.

736
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,130
Three is the mark to beat.

737
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,131
Got a chance.

738
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,132
>> Oh!

739
00:20:59,216 --> 00:20:59,758
>> PROBST: On and off the course

740
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,802
for Jaison.

741
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,803
Jaison, you cannot win immunity.

742
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,804
(applause)

743
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,805
>> Good job.

744
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,806
>> PROBST: Russell's up.

745
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,683
Dave's still the mark to beat

746
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,728
at three.

747
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,729
Russell gives it a ride.

748
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,730
>> Nice, Russ.

749
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,690
>> All right, Russ.

750
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,691
>> PROBST: Lands it in the four.

751
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,692
>> Nice.

752
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,693
>> Oh, man!

753
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,694
>> PROBST: That puts Russell in

754
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,653
the lead.

755
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,696
>> Good shot.

756
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,863
>> Good job, Russell.

757
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,823
>> PROBST: Brett is up.

758
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,408
Russell has four, which means

759
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,953
you have to land in a five or

760
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,081
the ten up in the sky.

761
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,751
That might do it.

762
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,752
>> Aw!

763
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,753
>> Nice try, Brett.

764
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,713
>> PROBST: And off the course.

765
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,714
>> Nice try, Brett.

766
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,715
>> Good shot, baby.

767
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,716
>> PROBST: Brett cannot win

768
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,717
immunity.

769
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,718
>> That was a good hit.

770
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,427
>> Go, Mick.

771
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,428
>> PROBST: Mick is up.

772
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,429
Russell still in the lead at

773
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,430
four.

774
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,723
Mick needs to get something in

775
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,852
the four to five range here.

776
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,894
That won't do it.

777
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,895
Mick scores two.

778
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,896
>> Ugh!

779
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,981
>> PROBST: That's not enough.

780
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:56,982
Mick out of this challenge.

781
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,984
Erik, take your swing.

782
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,569
Russell still in the lead with

783
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,653
four points.

784
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,697
>> Going for the ten, baby.

785
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,698
>> PROBST: Going for the ten.

786
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,699
>> Let's go, Erik.

787
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,700
>> PROBST: All the marbles.

788
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,161
>> Oh!

789
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,163
>> PROBST: Oh! A nice swing.

790
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,664
Just off the course, though.

791
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,665
Ends up zero.

792
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,666
>> Good swing, though.

793
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,667
>> You looked good.

794
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,668
>> Thanks.

795
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,669
>> Yeah, at least you looked

796
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,670
good.

797
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,671
>> PROBST: John.

798
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,672
>> All right.

799
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,548
>> PROBST: The last person.

800
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:25,093
Russell is one person away from

801
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,553
winning immunity.

802
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,431
Russell with four, which means,

803
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,515
John, you have to land in a five

804
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,643
or the ten to win immunity.

805
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,448
John gives it a ride.

806
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,449
Nicely done.

807
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,701
John lands in the five.

808
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,702
>> My God!

809
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,703
(applause)

810
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,704
>> PROBST: John wins individual

811
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,955
immunity.

812
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,956
>> Nice one, John!

813
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,584
>> Holy crap, Johnny!

814
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,835
>> Good job, John.

815
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,462
>> PROBST: All right.

816
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:05,133
The women are now up.

817
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:05,675
Natalie, you're first up for

818
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,720
the women.

819
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,560
>> Oh, man.

820
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,603
>> PROBST: Natalie down and

821
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,604
hard.

822
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,605
It bounces out of the course.

823
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,606
(all groaning)

824
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,649
No score for Natalie.

825
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,650
>> No! Nat!

826
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,651
>> Oh, goodness!

827
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,653
>> PROBST: Monica's up.

828
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:28,782
Another lefty.

829
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,950
Monica, nice swing.

830
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:30,951
>> Girl.

831
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:31,952
>> Oh, God.

832
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:32,953
>> PROBST: Ends up in the two.

833
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,787
Monica scores two.

834
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,788
>> That a way, baby.

835
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,915
>> PROBST: Kelly, you're up.

836
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,460
Two is the mark to beat.

837
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,546
>> Oh, good job, Kelly.

838
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,547
>> PROBST: Kelly.

839
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,548
>> Oh!

840
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,549
>> PROBST: With a three.

841
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,550
>> Good job, Kel!

842
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,260
>> PROBST: That puts Kelly in

843
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,469
the lead.

844
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,595
Shambo's up.

845
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,056
>> Let's go, Sham.

846
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,391
>> PROBST: Three is the mark to

847
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,643
beat.

848
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,686
Big swing.

849
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,687
>> Lovely.

850
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,688
>> PROBST: Little result.

851
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,689
>> Outstanding.

852
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,774
>> PROBST: No score for Shambo.

853
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,775
Laura, you're up.

854
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,068
>> Score.

855
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,069
>> PROBST: The last person.

856
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,071
Kelly-- still the mark to beat

857
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,072
at three.

858
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:09,698
You're going to need at least a

859
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,577
four to win immunity.

860
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,504
Laura lands it in the four.

861
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,507
Laura wins individual immunity!

862
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,508
(applause)

863
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,509
>> Good job, Laura.

864
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,969
>> You did good.

865
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,014
>> PROBST: Laura, John, come on

866
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,726
over.

867
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,727
Congratulations.

868
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,728
(applause)

869
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,729
>> Good job.

870
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,730
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

871
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,066
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

872
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,610
John and Laura cannot be voted

873
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,987
out at tonight's Tribal Council.

874
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,572
As for the rest of you, one of

875
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,698
you going home tonight.

876
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,908
Should be an interesting

877
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,159
afternoon for the newly-merged

878
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,160
camp.

879
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,536
By the way, what is your name?

880
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,537
>> Aiga.

881
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,538
>> PROBST: Aiga.

882
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,581
All right, Aiga, grab your

883
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,624
stuff, head back to camp.

884
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,708
See you at Tribal.

885
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,961
>> When I saw Laura win

886
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,796
immunity, I got a gut-wrenching

887
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,423
feeling in my stomach.

888
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,549
The plan had been put into

889
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,550
motion.

890
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,885
We were going to write down

891
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,220
Laura's name tonight, and now we

892
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,471
can't.

893
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,306
So, that sucked, because I

894
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,517
really wanted her gone.

895
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,824
>> Thank you.

896
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,621
>> They can't win anything.

897
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,248
>> No. No.

898
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,837
>> Yeah.

899
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,220
>> I don't know 'cause I haven't

900
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,846
talked to anybody yet.

901
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,226
>> I'm getting rid of the girl

902
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,310
thing.

903
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,520
>> Well, dude, that ain't going

904
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,521
to happen.

905
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,522
>> You don't think?

906
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,523
>> No.

907
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,608
The problem is Erik and Laura--

908
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,110
they will decide who will go

909
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,152
today.

910
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:11,778
If that means that we will lose

911
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,404
a number on your tribe, we lose

912
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,073
a number.

913
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,116
>> Laura would definitely be

914
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,325
gone, but she won immunity

915
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,494
today, and Shambo-- she don't

916
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:19,995
want to get rid of Monica.

917
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:20,787
She says that's not going to

918
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,830
happen.

919
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,707
She wants to let one of our

920
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,874
guys go.

921
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,002
I'm sure I'm being targeted, so

922
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,628
I don't want to have to play the

923
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,838
idol, but if I'm feeling antsy

924
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,048
about tonight, I might have to

925
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:43,560
go that route.

926
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,562
>> Yes.

927
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,563
>> Uh-huh.

928
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,690
I know he has it.

929
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,817
>> Mm-hmm.

930
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,818
>> Damn it!

931
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,819
He thinks he's going to go

932
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,654
first, so I bet you he's going

933
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,157
to play it tonight anyways.

934
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,454
>> Yeah. Yeah...

935
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,877
>> Perfect.

936
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,515
>> So the fact that he has it

937
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,642
seems kind of dangerous.

938
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,771
>> I know, I know.

939
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,772
>> We all know that. I know.

940
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,773
Listen. Listen to me, listen to

941
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,774
me, listen to me, listen to me.

942
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,775
This morning it was supposed to

943
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,776
be Laura.

944
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,070
Laura won immunity, saved Laura.

945
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,571
The next best thing that you can

946
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,113
do to weaken Laura is to ax

947
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:37,697
Monica.

948
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,450
Some members of Galu-- they just

949
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,118
want to go down the line--

950
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,953
Foa Foa, Foa Foa, and it's like

951
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:44,704
they're playing really junior

952
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,705
varsity<i> Survivor</i> right now.

953
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,959
There are tons of inherent risks

954
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,586
to breaking up the team that

955
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,213
we've worked this far to develop

956
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,214
at Galu, but it's a risk I'm

957
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,215
comfortable with, because I

958
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,216
still believe that it's in our

959
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,343
best interest to get rid of

960
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,470
Monica.

961
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,557
>> I can calm her down.

962
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,183
>> But you keep her at bay, you

963
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,559
keep her at bay.

964
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,560
>> I can calm her down.

965
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,561
You know, at first I didn't like

966
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,562
the idea.

967
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,563
However, by allowing me to vote

968
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,190
with Laura, when she gets

969
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,191
spooked after Tribal Council,

970
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,567
she'll have nobody to turn to

971
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,445
but me, and I can go ahead, gain

972
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,447
her trust, which could be good

973
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,991
for me down the road.

974
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,203
>> Are we gonna use Foa Foa?

975
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,204
>> We are?

976
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,415
>> Yeah.

977
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,550
>> Here's what needs to happen.

978
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,592
A: nobody talks to Shambo.

979
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,593
Period.

980
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,594
>> Perfect.

981
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,595
>> Let her vote whatever she

982
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,722
wants.

983
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,976
>> Okay?

984
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,188
>> If you go Monica, Monica,

985
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,189
Monica, it's done.

986
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,190
>> Yeah.

987
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,734
>> Erik-- he wanted to vote

988
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,735
Monica, which is crazy.

989
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,863
The plan to just vote Foa Foa

990
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,990
and shoot them down, you know,

991
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,367
turkey shoot-- pop, pop, pop,

992
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,036
pop, so there may be something

993
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,621
going on in Erik's head that

994
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,998
he's not letting on 'cause he's

995
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,293
a crafty, crafty dude, and that

996
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,421
makes me a little nervous.

997
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,966
(buzzing)

998
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,933
>> ...then definitely the three

999
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,560
of you will stay, and I'm pretty

1000
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,395
sure Russell will stay, anyway,

1001
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,522
so...

1002
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,527
We want him to think that he's

1003
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,528
going home tonight.

1004
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,655
That way, he plays the idol.

1005
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,910
So, what you need to know, you

1006
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:47,952
know.

1007
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,953
You choose a different route,

1008
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:49,954
there will be a different

1009
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:50,955
outcome, I can't guarantee the

1010
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,082
four of you are here tomorrow.

1011
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,006
>> Here's how I feel right now.

1012
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,007
I feel like Erik is talking ...

1013
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,134
to the tribe.

1014
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,979
>> Erik told us that if we get

1015
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,356
Russell to flush out the idol

1016
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,690
and use it tonight, they will

1017
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,067
agree to vote out one of their

1018
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,902
own, um, instead of one of us,

1019
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,738
but to be honest with you, I

1020
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:24,948
don't really like that guy.

1021
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,033
So I kind of want to just put

1022
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,826
four votes on Erik and-and let

1023
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,827
the ball roll.

1024
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,954
>> I don't know who...

1025
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,084
>> But I could leave this game

1026
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,086
easily, knowing that he went

1027
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,463
before me.

1028
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,100
>> Why is he freaking out?

1029
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,310
>> He wants all of the girls

1030
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,520
gone.

1031
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,521
>> I don't trust Erik.

1032
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,566
>> He was... Here's the thing.

1033
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,361
>> Well, because there's no way

1034
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,362
to pull it together.

1035
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,363
Like, we can ask Kel.

1036
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,364
>> Okay, okay.

1037
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:17,917
>> Okay, Kel.

1038
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,918
>> The thing of it is, like,

1039
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:19,919
Galu still has plenty of people,

1040
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,046
plenty.

1041
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,466
I'm telling you, y'all, he is

1042
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,218
going to wreak havoc.

1043
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,344
Kelly and Laura-- I just

1044
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,095
basically let them know that

1045
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,930
Erik needed to go now.

1046
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:31,931
We have four people.

1047
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:32,932
They have eight.

1048
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,476
It's not a big deal if they lose

1049
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,477
one.

1050
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,103
I'm definitely putting my faith

1051
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,439
in Laura and Kelly, and I'm just

1052
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,566
going to hope that it works.

1053
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,153
>> What?!

1054
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,071
>> He's trying to get you off

1055
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,072
tonight.

1056
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,073
>> Are you serious?

1057
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,200
>> Yeah.

1058
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,079
>> Really? Everyone's on board?

1059
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,672
>> He's manipulating everybody.

1060
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,799
>> Yeah, I know, but...

1061
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,013
>> Tonight Erik goes.

1062
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,014
>> Who's Erik?

1063
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,015
>> Erik.

1064
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,016
>> Our Erik?

1065
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,143
>> Yes.

1066
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,108
>> Wait.

1067
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,239
>> This is the first time that I

1068
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,699
don't know nothin'.

1069
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,992
All of a sudden, all hell breaks

1070
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,869
loose.

1071
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,287
All the girls want to vote Erik

1072
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,288
out now.

1073
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,373
I don't know what they're

1074
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,499
thinking.

1075
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,166
They could possibly be saying,

1076
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,752
"Hey, let's say, vote Erik.

1077
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,796
That way Russell will feel way

1078
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,421
comfortable, won't use his idol,

1079
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,047
we'll vote him out."

1080
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,341
And then, they get me and the

1081
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,342
idol.

1082
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,343
>> This is like going to Vegas.

1083
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,344
>> Yeah.

1084
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,345
>> What else can we do?

1085
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,513
They blindside one of us, we go

1086
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,514
home, we eat pizza.

1087
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,057
>> What concerns me is that it

1088
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,935
just seems almost too easy right

1089
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,228
now, and that makes me

1090
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,229
uncomfortable.

1091
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,731
Fortunately, I got my idol in

1092
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,650
my pocket, and I'll use it if

1093
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,820
need to use it.

1094
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,468
>> PROBST: Jaison, take me

1095
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,761
through the merge.

1096
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,345
Foa Foa's already down to four

1097
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,221
people.

1098
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,682
Now you have to go over to

1099
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,808
Galu's camp where they've been

1100
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,226
living this whole time.

1101
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,436
>> I mean, it's almost as

1102
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,478
frustrating as-as losing

1103
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,479
challenges, you know?

1104
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,522
But at least with the

1105
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,815
challenges, we had some say in

1106
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,816
it.

1107
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,234
So for me, a guy who is used to

1108
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,318
having at least some control

1109
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,903
over his life, I think more than

1110
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,029
even frustration, you just feel

1111
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,030
helpless.

1112
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,782
>> PROBST: Monica, how does this

1113
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,366
merge change the trust in the

1114
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,243
game?

1115
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,413
Before it was, can I trust the

1116
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,581
people on my tribe?

1117
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,290
Does it suddenly become, I<i> have</i>

1118
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,125
to trust the people on my tribe?

1119
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,210
>> In this game, you never

1120
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,004
really know who to trust.

1121
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,172
I mean, someone could be saying

1122
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,506
something to your face, and then

1123
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,049
saying something completely

1124
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,760
different behind your back.

1125
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,636
So even though Foa Foa is down

1126
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,013
in numbers, someone could turn

1127
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,097
their back on you.

1128
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,224
You just really never know.

1129
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,059
>> PROBST: Erik, looking at the

1130
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,561
four Foa Foa, what do you think

1131
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,439
Galu should base the vote on?

1132
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,274
>> You know, to me, I struggle

1133
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,276
to see anything that Foa Foa has

1134
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,737
to offer Galu.

1135
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,947
Let's just say that they were

1136
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,324
able to get a Galu member to

1137
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,243
turn in a very cohesive team, I

1138
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,244
would be floored if I saw them

1139
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,205
get one, let alone two or three

1140
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,332
that they would need to actually

1141
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,583
spin this game.

1142
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,292
And that's not me being cocky or

1143
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,127
confident.

1144
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,670
But I just struggle to see what

1145
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,589
it is that they can do, you

1146
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,590
know.

1147
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,966
Your heart goes out to them,

1148
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,134
but, you know, they're in the

1149
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,260
hole.

1150
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,637
>> PROBST: Russell, Erik's

1151
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,679
saying, "You don't offer us

1152
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,680
anything.

1153
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,140
Why do we need you at all?"

1154
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,559
>> Well, I don't like pity.

1155
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,311
I think that we have a lot to

1156
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,105
offer, and I think he's going to

1157
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:07,814
be surprised.

1158
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,856
>> Again, you see the tenacity

1159
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,233
in the eight of us since day

1160
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,611
one, so it's a long shot.

1161
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,612
>> PROBST: But can you

1162
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,447
understand why somebody who's

1163
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,324
down in numbers, like Foa Foa,

1164
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,243
would do anything to try to stay

1165
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,494
alive?

1166
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,286
>> I think one way to look at it

1167
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,497
is, how is it that they've

1168
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,790
reacted to the merge and

1169
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,833
mingling with us?

1170
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,543
I'll tell you right now-- Russ

1171
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,961
goes out there and scrambles.

1172
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:30,545
He's been in everybody's ear.

1173
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,630
Uh, Mick comes in, he does his

1174
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,256
thing, he takes it on the chin.

1175
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,298
He says the numbers are what

1176
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,299
they are.

1177
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,176
Natalie doesn't want to step on

1178
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,219
anybody's toes.

1179
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,555
And Jaison is-is just an enigma,

1180
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,639
because you see this

1181
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,723
intelligence, and you see this

1182
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,808
physical prowess and his

1183
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,350
athleticism, but you don't

1184
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,770
really see it come together.

1185
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,856
>> PROBST: Jaison, basically

1186
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,524
saying you got great potential,

1187
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,191
but not doing anything with it.

1188
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,735
>> Um, you can take a look at my

1189
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,736
résumé.

1190
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,113
I'm here to play a game.

1191
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,489
I'm here to be strategic in my

1192
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,490
own way.

1193
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,783
So, I have a strong, strong

1194
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,826
problem with that... with that

1195
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,910
comment.

1196
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,452
>> I mean, you want to talk

1197
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,245
about résumés, let's look at

1198
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,330
your résumé in this game from

1199
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,957
day one.

1200
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,583
You know, I'm thinking you're

1201
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,543
making my point.

1202
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,961
>> Honestly, the personal

1203
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,046
attacks on me in which someone

1204
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,589
says I can't put it together

1205
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,049
just-- they-they eat at me.

1206
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,135
You know, for 28 years, I've

1207
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,012
been fighting to-to do things,

1208
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,889
to accomplish things, and I feel

1209
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,599
like people have doubted me the

1210
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,391
entire way, and I've had to

1211
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,394
push through roadblocks that I

1212
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,021
couldn't go around or under or

1213
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,355
over, and so I think maybe it

1214
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,608
just takes me back to those

1215
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,650
days.

1216
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,943
And I've tried to play this

1217
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,320
game hard, but not take it too

1218
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:37,945
seriously, but sometimes, you

1219
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:38,529
know, something just kicks in,

1220
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,405
so...

1221
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,406
>> Well, I like that.

1222
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,700
You know, I like that in a

1223
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,701
player.

1224
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,368
If I was your coach, I would say

1225
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,369
that's what I like to hear.

1226
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,413
>> I guess the point is that I

1227
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,624
don't care what you like.

1228
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,625
>> PROBST: Russell, there's a

1229
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,627
lot of judgment coming from Galu

1230
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,669
to the Foa Foa group.

1231
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,087
Are you feeling a little

1232
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,881
attacked or maybe misunderstood?

1233
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,591
>> No, not at all.

1234
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,134
You know, we can still make this

1235
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:01,135
happen.

1236
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,178
This... We still have hope.

1237
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,180
>> PROBST: So, Erik, you got

1238
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,222
to respect Russell saying, "I

1239
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,265
don't care that we're down to

1240
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,266
four.

1241
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,351
I still believe I can win this

1242
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,352
game."

1243
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,394
>> I<i> do</i> respect the fact.

1244
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,979
He does not strike me as someone

1245
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,980
who gives up.

1246
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,065
I respect<i> that.</i>

1247
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,192
But this type of competitiveness

1248
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,362
is misaligned, and if he doesn't

1249
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,655
focus it within the next couple

1250
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,156
of days, if it's repairable,

1251
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,950
then I can't say 100% I respect

1252
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,951
it.

1253
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,035
>> In other words, just roll

1254

00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:40,688
votes-- Jaison.

1316
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,731
Erik.

1317
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,942
Six votes-- Erik, two votes--

1318
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,070
Jaison.

1319
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:52,616
Seventh person voted out of

1320
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,034
<i>Survivor: Samoa,</i> and the first

1321
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,036
member of our jury-- Erik.

1322
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,037
That's seven.

1323
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,122
That's enough.

1324
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,250
You need to bring me your torch.

1325
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,339
>> Good, B.

1326
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,678
>> PROBST: Erik, the tribe has

1327
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,806
spoken.

1328
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,729
Time for you to go.

1329
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,572
Well, your first vote as a new

1330
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,532
tribe, first blindside.

1331
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,075
This is most definitely a new

1332
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,076
game.

1333
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,077
Grab your torches.

1334
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,078
Head back to camp.

1335
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,206
Good night.

1336
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,345
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1337
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,305
from our next episode.

1338
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,768
>> PROBST: Next time on

1339
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,769
<i>Survivor.</i>

1340
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,853
>> Russell, Natalie,

1341
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,854
Mick, Jaison.

1342
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,855
>> PROBST: The old Galu declares

1343
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,856
open season on Russell.

1344
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,899
>> Russell is the most conniving

1345
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:07,816
player in the game right now.

1346
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,817
He needs to go.

1347
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,818
>> PROBST: And now he's out of

1348
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,819
idols...

1349
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,820
>> It was the dumbest move,

1350
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:12,821
playing that idol.

1351
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,697
>> PROBST: ...low on friends...

1352
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,740
>> It's got to be Russell.

1353
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:15,741
>> PROBST: ...and in need of

1354
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:15,950
luck.

1355
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,784
>> This is the first time that

1356
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,828
I'm struggling on what to do.

1357
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,792
>> Wow. Wow. Wow.

1358
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,711
I'm disappointed, but I said

1359
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,963
playing<i> Survivor</i> would be

1360
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:29,797
looking into a mirror, and I'm

1361
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,091
pretty proud of the face I see.

1362
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,384
I don't regret going home with

1363
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:33,926
the idol, 'cause you can't

1364
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,678
defend against something that's

1365
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,138
invisible, and this blindside

1366
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,223
was invisible to me.

1367
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,100
But I gave 100% of my heart, and

1368
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,227
I can hang my hat on that.
