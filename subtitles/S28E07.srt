translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,900
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,600
Solidarity of the "blues"!

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,500
Two policemen, Tony and Sarah, 
made an alliance pact.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,400
He knows that I will be loyal to him, 
and vice versa.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,900
But a surprise change...

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,200
Throw away your bandanas.

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,200
...separated them.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,700
I am the only 
original Aparri in the tribe,

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,900
with three members of Intelligence 
and three of Beauty.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,000
While the division was clear 
in Sarah's new tribe,

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,800
Tony's New Tribe

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,700
had everything 
Survivor can offer.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,700
Two idols...

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,000
I keep it to myself 
until I play it.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,900
...a surprise elimination...

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,500
...and they even saw 
one of them give up.

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,700
Lindsey retires from the game.

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,300
She was the body and Cliff the head. 
Two for the price of one.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,800
But despite everything, 
they won the last immunity.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Solana wins immunity!

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,600
The top five, baby!

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,400
On the board, the new Aparri 
was focused on a possible merger.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,400
If you want to go all the way, 
and you anticipate a merger,

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,300
your group must be united.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
At the merge, Jeremiah or Alexis 
could join the other side.

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,800
Eventually, everyone felt 
that Alexis was more likely to betray.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Alexis, the tribe has spoken.

29
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,900
There are eleven left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,500
- Alexis was crying? 
- Yes.

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,300
- Really? 
- Yes.

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,300
I felt great after 
the counseling. My game has improved.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,300
We can get there.

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,100
We are a good team.

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,500
Now everyone 
walks with the six.

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,800
A merger tomorrow would be 
the best news for us.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,700
Because we control the game. 
There are six of us and five of them.

38
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,100
In case a fusion 
happens as soon as we wake up,

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,700
we must choose 
our first two eliminated.

40
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,900
- So who first? 
- Random, Trish.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,500
Or Jefra. Everyone has to be considered 
.

42
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,800
Everyone understood.

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,000
- Oh yeah. 
- It's all good.

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,800
We are the top six, 100%.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,600
- It's in our hands. 
- As long as no one betrays.

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,500
The top six!

47
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,100
This group is supposed to be 
six tight-knit people.

48
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,500
If we can stick together, 
we can control the game,

49
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,400
and take out a less obvious target, 
like Trish or Jefra.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,800
Top six. That's not cool?

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,300
Much cooler than the top five!

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
It seems so simple.

53
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,600
But merging often shatters 
the best plans.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
Last night 
brought everyone together.

55
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,200
The main thing is to remain silent.

56
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,200
That they have no idea 
who is leaving.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,200
The only ones I could 
worry about are Jeremiah and you.

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,900
It could get out of hand here.

59
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Trust me, I'm not going anywhere.

60
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,100
That she accuses me of not 
keeping my word, it clicked.

61
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,300
No one likes 
to be called a liar

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,600
and basically she called me 
a liar, without saying so.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,600
I did nothing to make 
you doubt my trust.

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,100
I don't think you're going to cheat.

65
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,800
- That would be silly. 
- I won't.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,100
- That's why it hurts me. 
- I did not want to hurt you.

67
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,100
What more do I need to do 
to prove my loyalty to you?

68
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,500
This is where it will break.

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,500
If you don't trust 
me and I feel it.

70
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,600
If it seems to me that you think I'm 
hesitating, that will drive me away.

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,000
People think that a betrayal 
will cause the loss of this tribe.

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,500
But the loss will come 
from lack of confidence.

73
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,700
That will be it, and that will be our end.

74
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,100
I refuse to pass 
for a liar.

75
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,300
So let's shake hands, 
that's how I do.

76
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Me too. Let's shake hands. 
I am with you.

77
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,400
- You're with me? 
- I am with you.

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,100
Very well. 
No more talking about it.

79
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,500
In my work, 
we need proof.

80
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Just because you voted 
with us once doesn't mean I believe you.

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,600
There are eleven people left, 
eight have to leave, right?

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,500
You did what you had to do, 
from my point of view.

83
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,200
Not out of loyalty, but out of desperation, 
because it was the right thing to do.

84
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,200
You haven't proven anything to me, 
except that you're protecting yourself.

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,600
Show me an ex- 
teammate's blood on your hands and we'll talk.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,900
Survivor Season 28 Episode 7 
Serpent's Head

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,100
Hello Solana!

88
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,100
- Hello, the sun! 
- Hello, LJ.

89
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,800
It's hot. Not a cloud.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
- Sleep well, LJ? 
- Like at home.

91
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,500
- A little energy. 
- Thanks.

92
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,700
At first, I didn't have fun 
with my teammates.

93
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,700
Now, with the new Solana, 
I have fun with everyone.

94
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,700
I open it and you catch it.

95
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,200
Seventeenth day, 
and I'm having fun like never before.

96
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,200
He is thick. 
And feel how heavy it is!

97
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
But it's a bit boring, 
to be honest.

98
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,900
Mail!

99
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,700
'Cause there's 
no fuss, no shenanigans,

100
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,300
no spying... 
I like that, you know?

101
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,800
Let's see what it is.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
â€œPack the necessities 
for the next 22 days.

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,900
And go to the Aparri camp, 
where you will stay until the end of the game."

104
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,500
Good.

105
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,700
We have to stay strong.

106
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,600
Don't forget what we went through here.

107
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,100
It was too good to be true.

108
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,900
Merging is both 
exciting and scary.

109
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,800
It's six against five. 
We could be in trouble.

110
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,400
Thank god I still have 
that immunity idol.

111
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,000
This idol is like 
one more person in my alliance.

112
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,300
We are five, plus the idol.

113
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,100
If anyone from Solana 
needs it, I'll play it.

114
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,500
So I believe we are 
in a good situation.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,600
"Maybe we should tidy up 
a bit and make some space."

116
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,300
"Guests from Solana 
will be arriving soon."

117
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,600
"And some may well 
stay for the next 22 days."

118
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,800
We did it!

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,100
The tribes come together.

120
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,500
I believe it's a merger. 
I hope.

121
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,700
In any case, the others arrive, 
we will live on the same beach.

122
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,100
They come here?

123
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,500
It says they could stay 
for the next 22 days.

124
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,500
But it will be three days for one, 
six days for another...

125
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,100
We have reached the majority merger.

126
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,600
When these five arrive, 
it will be them against us.

127
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
I won't let anyone forget it.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,600
I believe there is 
something going on.

129
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,400
- Is it a rowboat? 
- Yes.

130
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,300
They better have food.

131
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,700
We come in peace!

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
Do you bring food?

133
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,000
We bring back everything we took from you!

134
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,700
We will make the chain.

135
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,000
When they arrived, I was nervous 
to see my former teammates again.

136
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,300
It was like an old friend 
you haven't spoken to in years.

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,100
It's good to be home!

138
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,600
The mosquito net is back.

139
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,400
Don't let go, the wine is in it!

140
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,400
They started unloading 
their belongings and food.

141
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Do you see the bread?

142
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
And I did...

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,200
We have a nice picnic.

144
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,500
Spencer, nice 
to finally meet you!

145
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,600
- I am Jefra. 
- Nice to meet you.

146
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,000
I am Sarah.

147
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I see you've lost... 
a teammate.

148
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,200
I didn't expect 
my girlfriend Alexis to leave.

149
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,700
We were very close, 
I could have easily poached her.

150
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,800
"Dung! 
What to do now?".

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,500
Let's read that.

152
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,100
"Congratulations, 
your tribes are merged."

153
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,900
We have achieved fusion!

154
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,400
"Enjoy the feast, 
you've earned it."

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,100
"Hidden idols 
are always in play."

156
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,400
"And an idol with special powers 
is hidden near your camp."

157
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
- I'm shivering. 
- "Special powers"!

158
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,300
Has this ever happened?

159
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,400
A special-powered immunity idol 
?!

160
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
They are powerful enough already, 
but with special powers?!

161
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
A different power.

162
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,200
This sends you home.

163
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,700
I do not want it!

164
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,300
There is only one way 
to know these special powers,

165
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,400
is to find that idol.

166
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,300
Of course, I will look for her. 
For two, three, four days.

167
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,200
It's weird to be back.

168
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,500
You have to think of a tribal name.

169
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
Solarri?

170
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,300
- Mix Solana and Aparri? 
- Yes.

171
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,800
- So... - How 
about we talk about it while eating?

172
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,300
There is wine...

173
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
Oh my God! Look at this!

174
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,300
Look!

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,600
Dude, it's Christmas!

176
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,600
Part of the excitement of the merger was 
the shock of getting there.

177
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,300
I was in last place,

178
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,000
in one of the worst tribes 
in Survivor history.

179
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,000
And here I am at the fusion, 
with a new life.

180
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I have control.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm close 
to Sarah and Jeremiah,

182
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,700
close to that group of six 
who could rule the game.

183
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
- So you took Alexis out. 
- Eh yes.

184
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,500
Yeah, give us the scoop!

185
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,600
She attacked me, 
I eliminated her.

186
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
We could be in trouble.

187
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,900
Six against five is tough.

188
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,700
My only hope is Sarah, 
who is an ex-Aparri.

189
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,900
She swore on her badge 
to stay with me.

190
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,100
My fear is that 
if Sarah does not change sides,

191
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
we're screwed, I'm screwed.

192
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,900
I don't want to be screwed.

193
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,700
We've reached fusion, 
do you believe it?

194
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,900
Inhale deeply.

195
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,500
Never release your abs. 
Maintain tension.

196
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,300
And keep your shoulders straight. So.

197
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,700
It's good. 
You're pretty flexible, Tash.

198
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,500
- Yes. 
- It's certain.

199
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,100
Release. 
Once again.

200
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,900
Inhale...

201
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,100
I'm going spearfishing 
and resting a bit.

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,700
Who is the head of the snake, 
in your opinion?

203
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,500
I do not know.

204
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,500
Intelligence seems to form a core.

205
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,000
At this point there is a group 
of five, my alliance,

206
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,800
and a group of six, 
half Intelligence, half Beauty.

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,500
And then there is Sarah, 
the sixth person.

208
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,500
I want to talk to Sarah, 
we had a real bond before.

209
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,500
You have to patch things up with her.

210
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
I will try 
to bring her back to us.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,400
We need someone who rocks.

212
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,700
We'll turn things around, 
and it'll be us six against them five.

213
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,600
I hope Sarah 
is our missing link.

214
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,200
How do you position yourself 
now?

215
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Honestly, I hesitate. 
What happened...

216
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,000
- Then no need to think. 
- The Intelligents are welded.

217
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,300
If we get back together, listen: 
Sarah, Tony, Woo and Trish.

218
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,900
- Do we have Trish? 
- She's with me 100%.

219
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,500
That's five. It makes equality.

220
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,600
LJ and Jeffra. 
We are six and they are five.

221
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,300
They will leave one by one, 
it's as simple as that.

222
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,200
I want Sarah to believe 
that I want her with me in the final,

223
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,500
as we said, 
two cops in front of the jury.

224
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,100
I'm going to promise her, guarantee it, 
whatever it takes to reassure her,

225
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,300
that she believes that I am sincere, 
that I want her with me

226
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,100
to advance in the game, 
unlike the other tribe.

227
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,500
It can be very simple.

228
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,000
If you give me your word... 
Swear on your badge.

229
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,300
- Swear on my badge? 
- That you are with us.

230
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Whether you'll vote 
for Spencer or Lindsey.

231
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,600
No, Spencer or Kass.

232
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,300
- Spencer or Kass? 
- Yeah.

233
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,500
I don't know if I can, Tony.

234
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's advise later.

235
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,100
Tell me when you're ready.

236
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,300
And if you swear on your badge, 
that's fine with me.

237
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,700
I have the best 
possible position in this game.

238
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,500
Five against five, and I'm in the middle.

239
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,800
A sarah sandwich. 
It's perfect!

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,400
- So who to target? 
- Doesn't matter.

241
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,700
But I think we have to 
separate the Intelligents.

242
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,500
So, anyone but me!

243
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,500
I guarantee you that with us, 
you will advance.

244
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,100
It's guaranteed. 
It's your turn.

245
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
This is your chance.

246
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,200
I didn't expect 
to be able to decide.

247
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,400
It is a difficult situation.

248
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
But whatever my choice, 
I am in a good position.

249
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Because I will decide 
the future of this game.

250
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,600
Alright, friends.

251
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,200
You want to know everything?

252
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
I want to know what you know.

253
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,500
LJ doesn't have an idol, 
so if he doesn't win immunity,

254
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,900
he's leaving, because we would vote 
for him, wouldn't we?

255
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,000
I think he has an idol.

256
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I don't think he should 
go first.

257
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,700
- Someone has an idol. 
- And it's not me.

258
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,900
- LJ has an idol? 
- Yeah.

259
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,800
I don't have an idol, 
so I think LJ does.

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,400
This is what worries 
me and makes me nervous.

261
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,500
I think 
Jefra should go first.

262
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,100
No. It's LJ or Woo.

263
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,800
You have to take out a tough guy.

264
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,100
We need to get rid 
of Woo or LJ.

265
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,200
It can't be LJ, because...

266
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,100
I'm afraid he has the idol.

267
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,700
So it must be Woo.

268
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,200
But if it's not Woo, 
it will be Trish.

269
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,700
No. Very bad idea. 
She is not dangerous.

270
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,900
It's silly to argue with me.

271
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm not saying that 
I should be treated like a princess,

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,900
but it would be better 
not to cross me.

273
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,250
We can pretend, 
but it don't have to be LJ,

274
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,500
for I fear he has an idol.

275
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, that would be a bad idea.

276
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,900
But I 
disagree with Trish.

277
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,400
It would be fatal for us.

278
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,600
What if Woo wins immunity? 
It won't be LJ.

279
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,500
- Tony, then? 
- Yeah.

280
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
I can do whatever I want.

281
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,100
Are you looking for a fight with me? 
I will go with the camp opposite.

282
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,900
Don't provoke me, 
because I will make you leave.

283
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,000
Trish and Jefra can stay. 
You have to eliminate a guy.

284
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,300
- You don't think "long term". 
- You know what?

285
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Trish is close to Tony. 
She's not from LJ.

286
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,700
I don't trust the cop.

287
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,500
When a member of a supposed 
alliance of six says:

288
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,900
"I will only vote for such and such, 
and in no case for such and such.",

289
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,500
That tells me 
she's not in the six.

290
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,700
She is in one.

291
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,700
If there are six of us, 
we can't make a fuss.

292
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,200
I don't want 
anyone to force my hand, like...

293
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,700
Nobody is forcing you. 
We talked about it before on the beach.

294
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,300
I never accepted 
that Trish was the first.

295
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Everything will be alright.

296
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,500
We'll talk again tomorrow.

297
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,300
We will meet 
and the majority will decide.

298
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,800
Right off the bat, Tony tells me:

299
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,200
"If you come with us, 
you choose who goes."

300
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,000
"If I go 
with my old teammates,

301
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
they'll let me choose who goes.",

302
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,400
"That's who I want out.".

303
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,300
- We will speak about it tomorrow. 
- But I don't force my hand.

304
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,700
Nobody accuses you of it.

305
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,300
Nobody should have that 
much power in this game.

306
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Who made her queen?

307
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,600
I can't look at her anymore. 
I want to hit her sometimes.

308
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,200
Do you see fish?

309
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,100
- Is that a sea cucumber? 
- A blue starfish.

310
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,900
I'm going to sit on this log.

311
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,300
I'm tired of people only 
talking to me to get my vote.

312
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,500
"What are you going to do? 
What are you going to do?"

313
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,800
It will get awkward, 
after the first tip.

314
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
Because they won't talk to you anymore.

315
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,300
I won't talk to you anymore then.

316
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,400
You don't get 
what I'm saying.

317
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,300
I like when people 
lose their temper.

318
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,100
- That's telling. 
- What did I miss?

319
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,800
This morning, things were heating 
up between the two girls.

320
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,100
I believe 
it's between Kass and Sarah.

321
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,400
The dispute made me happy,

322
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,900
because I realized that these six 
are not so close together.

323
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,900
And it cracks before 
we even go to the test.

324
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,700
Obviously, they're 
all feeling a little paranoia.

325
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,300
What happened?

326
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,000
We didn't agree 
on who to eliminate.

327
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,100
You said 
you wouldn't vote for Trish.

328
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,100
Yes, because I find the idea 
very bad.

329
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,800
I spent eleven days with her. 
She doesn't strategize.

330
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,100
I see both points of view.

331
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,500
I don't want us to be divided 
over nonsense.

332
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,800
When I found out about the trade 
between Kass and Sarah,

333
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,800
I didn't care 
who was right or wrong.

334
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,200
My only concern 
was to reconcile them.

335
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Your situation is difficult.

336
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,700
You are in a precarious situation, 
I respect that.

337
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,000
It's your old friends, 
and now you have new ones.

338
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,400
And everyone is 
trying to attract you.

339
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,700
Who should we vote for?

340
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,700
If we don't vote LJ, 
then Tony or Woo.

341
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,500
Tasha took 
Sarah's side in our argument.

342
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,600
And then damn!

343
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,300
Someone treats 
someone else in the alliance badly,

344
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,000
and everyone gives in to the tyrant?

345
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,600
"And me? 
Why not be cool with me?"

346
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,500
I count for butter? 
Ah, I don't interest you anymore!

347
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,800
When people say "I will not vote 
for such and such", it makes me nervous.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,400
And I am accused of being tyrannical, 
I am not a tyrant! I'm trying...

349
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,100
Go on...

350
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,700
It doesn't matter that Kass likes me.

351
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
As soon as I say something, 
here's the reaction, it's like...

352
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,100
It's like... If you attacked me 
silently, like...

353
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,600
I attack you when I do "what"?

354
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,000
It's an attack, right?

355
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,300
Tell me, is it important 
that Kass likes you?

356
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
If you don't like Kass, 
vote against her!

357
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,500
I know Sarah and Tasha 
are against me.

358
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,100
I know my situation.

359
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,800
At this point, all six break down.

360
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,500
- You realize that your role is central. 
- And it sucks.

361
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,300
It will determine the fate of five 
other people. In this game.

362
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,200
- No, it will determine your fate. 
- Yours.

363
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,900
Yeah.

364
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,700
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

365
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,900
First of all, I'm taking up 
tribal immunity.

366
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,850
There is no more tribal immunity.

367
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,100
This is what you want now.

368
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,900
Individual immunity.

369
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,200
With this around your neck, 
you are protected on the board.

370
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,100
No better feeling 
in the world than wearing this.

371
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,400
Without, you could 
be in trouble.

372
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,400
Today 
you will balance

373
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,900
on triangular platforms, 
in the water,

374
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,000
feet on very narrow 
points of support.

375
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,600
Periodically, you step up 
a notch, increasing the difficulty.

376
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,200
If you fall, you are eliminated.

377
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,300
The last person standing wins 
immunity and is protected from voting.

378
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,400
The losers will go to the council, 
where someone will be eliminated.

379
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,600
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

380
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,700
OK, let's go! 
Everyone get in place!

381
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,100
Place your feet 
on the first support point.

382
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,200
Let's go.

383
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,100
Everyone is on their feet, 
and the ordeal begins.

384
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,000
The rules are simple.

385
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,800
Only your feet can 
touch the structure.

386
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,700
But not your hands, or your buttocks.

387
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,200
If that happens, you're out.

388
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,600
You will stay there for 15 minutes.

389
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,900
Think of it as a warm-up.

390
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,900
Relax.

391
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,900
Prepare your body for what is to come.

392
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,200
We go to the next support point.

393
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,500
You can help yourself 
with your hands.

394
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Everyone settle in well.

395
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,100
Let's go.

396
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,500
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

397
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,500
Everyone take their hands off. 
This ordeal begins again.

398
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,200
You're going to have 
to hold on a little harder.

399
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,000
There is less space for your feet.

400
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Everyone seems to be doing well.

401
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,700
Where do you hurt, LJ?

402
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,200
Everywhere.

403
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,900
This ordeal is clearly 
no fun, Jeff.

404
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,300
It is very painful.

405
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,100
We have another 
15 minutes.

406
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,700
Thirty seconds left 
in this round.

407
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,700
Then we will go to the top.

408
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,200
Everyone is holding up well, 
I'm impressed.

409
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
What you are doing is working.

410
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,900
What you tell yourself to hold on to, 
keep repeating it to yourself.

411
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,100
Fifteen seconds. Don't 
relax, don't give up.

412
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,800
You've held out so far, 
don't make a mistake now.

413
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,700
We go to the top. 
You can use your hands.

414
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,200
But if you fall now, 
you're out.

415
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,800
You have fifteen seconds 
to settle down.

416
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,400
Spencer falls, he fails 
to make the transition!

417
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Kass fails 
to transition!

418
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,200
LJ has fallen!

419
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,900
Sarah has fallen! 
Jefra has fallen!

420
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,200
They are only six!

421
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,100
Tasha is eliminated!

422
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,400
Trish is eliminated!

423
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,800
Four people survived! 
Jeremiah has fallen!

424
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,500
More than three!

425
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,400
The wind knocks Morgan down!

426
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,000
The wind is unleashed! 
It's between Tony and Woo!

427
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,600
Nice recovery from Tony!

428
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,500
They are only two! 
Tony and Woo!

429
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,500
Great balancing act.

430
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,800
This last round got 
the better of everyone except those two!

431
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,900
How are you feeling, Woo?

432
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,300
Stay focused!

433
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,000
Don't get distracted!

434
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,700
New beautiful recovery from Tony.

435
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,300
Someone is going to deserve that 
first individual immunity.

436
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,800
- Good luck, Woo! 
- Tony falls!

437
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,200
Woo wins the first 
individual immunity!

438
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,100
Good game.

439
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,300
Woo, come here!

440
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,300
Just here.

441
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,900
The first individual immunity.

442
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,800
Woo is protected at tonight's council.

443
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,500
As for you, after 19 days, 
someone will be eliminated.

444
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,000
The afternoon 
should be interesting.

445
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,100
Pack your things, get back 
to camp, we'll see you at the council.

446
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,500
Congratulation.

447
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,000
The first immunity, my brother.

448
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,500
- Nice job, Woo. 
- It was hard.

449
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,100
You delivered, Tony.

450
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,100
No idea, man.

451
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,500
Wow, well done.

452
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,000
There are eleven people.

453
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,900
A core five, 
a core five, and me.

454
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,400
I have to decide.

455
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,400
It makes sense that 
the martial arts teacher won.

456
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,500
There are 
more serious competitors on Tony's side.

457
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,400
I was the first in the water.

458
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I would rather go with 
the weak, the new Aparri.

459
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,600
The alliance is solid.

460
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,600
There's just the dissension 
between Kass and me.

461
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,100
Shall we fetch water 
now or later?

462
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,500
Let's go now.

463
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,300
I'll decide 
who leaves next.

464
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,300
It's me who decides. 
I'm the President, for now.

465
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,100
Who do you want?

466
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,100
Jeff, I think.

467
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,900
I think 
the smartest one is Jefra.

468
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,600
Exactly what I thought.

469
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,600
There is no chance 
that an idol will be played,

470
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,200
no chance of her having one.

471
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,900
I don't think any of them have an idol.

472
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,800
We need to get rid 
of someone vital in the game.

473
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,900
Jefra will not win immunity, 
we can eliminate him whenever we want.

474
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,800
And she's not smart enough 
to play strategically.

475
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,700
Tony is very smart and observant.

476
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,000
I will vote for LJ or Tony.

477
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Look at them!

478
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,000
Tony, don't trust Sarah. 
We think she's in control.

479
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,600
Yes, because they 
put her on a pedestal.

480
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,200
They need his vote. 
Like us. So I will do the same.

481
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Sarah will never leave them.

482
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,700
She is comfortable there.

483
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,700
She leads the dance. 
She is the center of the group.

484
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,600
She is the most powerful 
player of the moment.

485
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,700
They need his vote.

486
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,400
Do you really think you 
can convince her to...

487
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,700
- Just yesterday... 
- But not today.

488
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,500
Did you see that pussy fight?

489
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,000
It was today, and I do 
n't think Kass is comfortable.

490
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,600
I can approach Kass, 
I have a good contact with her.

491
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,000
Let me 
talk to Sarah first.

492
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,100
If that's okay with you, I'll do it.

493
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,000
What if you think she's lying? 
Am I going to see Kass?

494
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,900
Kass will play you.

495
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,400
So, what are we doing tonight?

496
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,000
I want Tony out.

497
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,400
Alright, but I'm afraid 
he has an idol.

498
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,400
I guarantee you he doesn't.

499
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
If you think there isn't...

500
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,100
I guarantee you he doesn't.

501
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,700
Let's vote Tony, then.

502
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,900
OK. As long as 
everyone agrees.

503
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,600
Originally, we were supposed to stay cool 
and eliminate Jefra or Trish,

504
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,600
to be in the majority.

505
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,700
And only then 
take care of the big boys,

506
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,500
who might have 
idols and strategies.

507
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
I hope that all will be well.

508
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,400
But Sarah wanted 
it to be Tony.

509
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,200
She thinks she's the boss.

510
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,900
Is there anything to say 
to possibly save me?

511
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,700
Yes, find an idol.

512
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,500
Am I the only one seeing it? 
I know she will destroy the game.

513
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,000
And in this case, I want to strike 
preemptively. I want to destroy it.

514
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,900
If you come with us, there are five of us...

515
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,100
It's exactly the same opposite.

516
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,900
But without Trish, Woo and me, 
who you started with.

517
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,000
For Trish and me, you pass 
LJ, Jefra and Woo.

518
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,100
So you're third, 
along with Trish and me.

519
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,200
I want to think about it alone.

520
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,300
If you go with them, 
let's say you eliminate me,

521
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,000
or LJ, whatever, one of us. 
We are only four.

522
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,900
And you are six. Six against four.

523
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,900
They can eliminate you, 
and there are still five of them.

524
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,300
They don't need you. 
You don't have anyone there.

525
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,300
Nobody, Sara.

526
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,200
It's stupid. I know all that.

527
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,300
I'm not stupid.

528
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,900
Eliminating Tony 
is not personal.

529
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,400
It's actually paying him 
a big compliment.

530
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,500
Tony and I have a relationship 
because we're both cops.

531
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,800
But it is the most dangerous. 
He observes everything.

532
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,800
He is sneaky. 
He is exactly like me.

533
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,800
And I would eliminate myself if I could.

534
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,300
If you want Kass gone, 
we swear on our badges,

535
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,400
you want her to go, 
come with us and she's gone.

536
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,900
If you're ready, 
we'll do it for you.

537
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,100
- You're turning the game upside down now. 
- I say.

538
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't want 
you to think I'm tricking you.

539
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Let me digest that. 
I do not say no.

540
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,400
But I won't make up my mind 
until I'm on the council.

541
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,700
Tony, it's going to play. 
No need to worry.

542
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,900
No. Everything is fine.

543
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
When Sarah tells me 
she wants to think,

544
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,900
that she will decide at the council...

545
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,800
Serious? I can't 
believe she said that!

546
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,500
I think now 
that she will not join us.

547
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,000
One thing is certain, 
at the slightest doubt, I play the idol.

548
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,700
I will not go with the idol.

549
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,200
You're at the bottom of your alliance, 
I thought you were at the top.

550
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,900
I have been replaced.

551
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:03,000
If one of us leaves, 
then they will eliminate you.

552
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,200
Interested in joining us?

553
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,700
I don't think 
that's doable.

554
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,900
If you could eliminate anyone 
on your team, who would it be?

555
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,600
I would eliminate Sarah.

556
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,100
Yes, that would sound good to me too.

557
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,100
It was more or less our idea.

558
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,900
I propose. Up to you to decide.

559
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,700
Trish tried to put me to sleep.

560
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,700
She told me 
they were going to vote for Sarah.

561
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,000
It suprised me.

562
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
But maybe they're 
smarter than I thought.

563
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,300
Probably more 
than my other five.

564
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,600
If they think 
Sarah is the problem,

565
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,900
maybe I'll change sides.

566
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,900
Let's go. We're eliminating it tonight.

567
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,300
Why?

568
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,100
I spoke with Kass.

569
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,300
- I asked him... 
- These two don't get along.

570
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,800
Listen. I asked 
her who she would like to eliminate.

571
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,400
She said Sarah.

572
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,000
I begged her to join us.

573
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,800
She thought it was impossible, 
but I told her no.

574
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
- So you want...? 
- Sarah.

575
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,500
We're voting for Sarah tonight.

576
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,100
Vote with us 
and we'll take care of you.

577
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,200
Trust me.

578
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,900
I love that Sarah 
thinks she's the boss.

579
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,700
The new Aparri votes for Tony, 
at the request of Queen Sarah.

580
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,500
Solana votes for Sarah. 
I really believe I am in the middle.

581
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,700
I believe I usurped 
Sarah's throne tonight.

582
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,300
Once again, "Chaos-Kass" 
will show up on the council.

583
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,000
So, LJ, where are we?

584
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,600
What is the mood 
of this group of eleven?

585
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,700
I do not know. I believe I have 
the most difficult position.

586
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,000
And if I leave, I'll be flattered,

587
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,100
it's the worst-best compliment 
you can receive,

588
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,400
to be the most dangerous in the game.

589
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,200
Tasha, well said.

590
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
He is ready to leave, 
to extinguish his torch.

591
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,300
At this stage of the game, 
we are looking for the most dangerous,

592
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,300
so he has a lot to worry about.

593
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,900
Tony, the old Aparri 
stayed together, except for Sarah.

594
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,500
Now there is the new Aparri 
and the new Solana.

595
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,500
Do you notice different groups 
coming together?

596
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,800
Indeed, Jeff.

597
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,800
But these people are smart, 
and I hope they realize

598
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,300
that it is not 
with the majority that we advance,

599
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,600
but with a pleasant alliance, 
with whom one feels good.

600
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,800
Sounds like you're 
worried about your fate.

601
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,800
It's true, Jeff, 
I'm a little worried.

602
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,100
I come from a minority tribe in number.

603
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,100
And I could be a threat.

604
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,800
I'm 40, 
I'm bald and old,

605
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,400
but the flame 
still burns within me.

606
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,700
Are Kass, Tony and LJ 
right to be concerned,

607
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,100
considering there is 
a group of six and a group of five?

608
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes, I would worry 
if I was a strong male,

609
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,600
who assures in hardships, 
in the minority group.

610
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,200
LJ, when do idols 
come in?

611
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Do you think we found them, 
does anyone have one?

612
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,700
Since no idol appeared,

613
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,400
it could be 
a good Survivor joke.

614
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,300
I do not know.

615
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,900
- There wouldn't be? 
- There are idols. I have one.

616
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,700
And I will use it for my tribe.

617
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,300
- Do you have an idol? 
- Sure.

618
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,800
- Do you want to take her out? 
- What will that prove?

619
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,200
- That you are telling the truth. 
- And what does it get me?

620
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
- You tell us you have one, so... 
- All right.

621
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,500
There she is.

622
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,100
Inquiring minds want to know.

623
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,600
Inquiring minds want to see. 
There she is.

624
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,700
I will wear it with pride.

625
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,400
And that doesn't mean 
I'll use it for myself.

626
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,700
I can give it to LJ, to Jefra, to Trish. 
He's a community idol.

627
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,300
So you're planning 
on making a big splash tonight.

628
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,000
It'll be a big hit, Jeff.

629
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Look at these six. 
Look what's going on, Jeff.

630
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,900
Look at them!

631
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,300
- The other? 
- And Spencer and Tasha change their vote.

632
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,100
They can change everything.

633
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,200
The other.

634
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,300
- It's debatable. 
- A moment.

635
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,700
The other. Yes, the other.

636
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,700
Look at this!

637
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,200
We stay the same. The same. The same.

638
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Do we put an end 
to the suspense and move on to the vote?

639
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
Absolutely.

640
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,300
We are impatient.

641
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,300
Well, we vote for the other.

642
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
It's cool!

643
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,300
I love it when it's so alive.

644
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,900
It's time to vote. 
Trish, over to you.

645
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,500
I will count the votes.

646
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,200
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

647
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,600
now is the time to do it.

648
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Can you confirm 
that it is valid?

649
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,900
Can you confirm that for me, Jeff?

650
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,400
Yes, it is an immunity idol.

651
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
I would like to give it to LJ.

652
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Let's see if I 
read these people right, Jeff.

653
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,900
Votes against LJ 
will not count.

654
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,900
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

655
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,600
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

656
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,100
- Hold on, Jeff. 
- Yes?

657
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,000
I would like to protect 
Tony's back.

658
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,400
Yo, I bring!

659
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,000
I hate you.

660
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,700
You should not have. 
But I appreciate.

661
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,500
Because I think you are "the other".

662
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,200
He is also 
an immunity idol.

663
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,800
Votes against Tony 
won't count either.

664
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,700
Unbelievable.

665
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,800
I thought you were "the other". 
Let's see what happens.

666
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,500
I will read the votes.

667
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,800
Let it be Tony!

668
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,600
First vote...

669
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,300
Jefra.

670
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,900
Jefra.

671
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,500
Sarah.

672
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,000
Two Jefra votes, 
two Sarah votes.

673
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
Jefra.

674
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,500
Sarah.

675
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,500
New equality.

676
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,300
Three Youfra votes, 
three Sarah votes.

677
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,800
Jefra.

678
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,300
Sarah.

679
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,100
New equality.

680
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,600
Four Youfra votes, 
four Sarah votes.

681
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,100
Jefra.

682
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,600
Sarah.

683
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,600
Equality.

684
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,100
Five Youfra votes, five Sarah votes. 
One vote remains.

685
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,300
Seventh person eliminated 
and first member of the jury...

686
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm tremble.

687
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,100
Who betrayed?

688
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,000
Not me.

689
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,300
Sarah, the tribe has spoken.

690
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,100
- It's time to go. 
- Thanks.

691
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,700
- Good luck! 
- Thank you, Sarah.

692
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,200
Kass...

693
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,000
Well done, Kass.

694
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,000
We lost two idols, 
but we will get them back.

695
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,100
Zero chance of winning the game.

696
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,200
The road is long.

697
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,100
This vote was clearly a shock.

698
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,500
I predict the sequel 
will be tumultuous.

699
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,400
Take your torches, return 
to camp. Good night.

700
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,500
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

701
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,500
In the next episode of Survivor...

702
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,600
I will speak harshly 
to you because you speak harshly to me.

703
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,300
It's a war of words 
between two Survivors.

704
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,700
She's a sour old woman.

705
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,000
But it's nothing 
compared to the chaos

706
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,300
created by a hidden idol.

707
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,000
It's a crazy treasure hunt.

708
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,500
I go into ninja mode.

709
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,500
I was completely calm,

710
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,300
waiting for Jeff to 
come up with the last name,

711
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,700
and when I saw "Sarah", 
I went "huh?".

712
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,100
We thought we had 
a solid group of six.

713
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,100
I don't know why Kass 
changed sides,

714
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,100
but they got me.
