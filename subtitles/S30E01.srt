translated to english from Addic7ed french: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,800
After 29 seasons and 15 years,

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,060
Survivor, TV's biggest 
social experiment,

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,400
break the mold once again.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,700
These 18 Americans were 
divided into three tribes,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,200
according to their professions 
and their approaches to life.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,600
The White Collar tribe, 
made up of a Yahoo executive,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,730
of a media consultant 
and former university professor

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,230
and a retail buyer.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,200
They are accustomed to ordering 
and deciding to obtain satisfaction.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,400
I am a buyer for 
a department store. I am demanding.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I made everyone 
who worked for me cry.

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm the devil.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,300
In college, I 
taught a course on Survivor.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,400
Few of the things I wanted 
to do that I didn't accomplish.

16
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,200
I step on the people 
I need to level up.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
In the business world, 
I worked in hard boxes.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,730
Everyone wants your spot. 
And it's the same in Survivor.

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,500
Everyone has the same goal.

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,560
Here we go, kids!

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,600
Work Blues. This tribe 
is made up of a policewoman,

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,430
a rodeo professional 
and a post office worker.

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,360
They are used 
to hard, physical work

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,800
and aren't afraid to get 
their hands dirty to get the job done.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,230
I work 
on an oil rig.

26
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,100
I'm usually the most 
covered in oil and mud.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
It's the same in this game.

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,900
You can't win 
without getting your hands dirty.

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,800
And my hands will be gross.

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,500
I am a single mother and hairdresser.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,330
Having a little girl is hard, 
but it made me who I am.

32
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,100
Mentally, no one in the world 
is as strong as me.

33
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,960
I have worked at the Post Office 
for 22 years.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,630
I am here to live my dream.

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,360
I've dreamed of being in Survivor 
since season 1, episode 1.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,560
I want to be remembered.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,730
One way or another, 
you won't forget me.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,700
The Colorless Tribe.

39
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,560
This group includes 
a sailing teacher,

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,830
a YouTube legend 
and a coconut seller.

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,230
They use their free spirits 
to get ahead in life.

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,130
I am curious, an adventurer, 
I let myself be carried by the wind.

43
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,200
I do what I want 
when I want.

44
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,360
But of course, I want the million. 
Money makes life easier.

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,230
Ever seen someone 
unhappy on a jet ski?

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,900
When people find out 
that I'm studying law,

47
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,930
they probably see me 
as a ruthless capitalist.

48
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,600
But this is not the case.

49
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,000
I do this for the poor, 
the castaways of life.

50
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,800
I am not an anarchist. 
I am for the common good.

51
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,160
As a coconut seller, 
I seek the truth.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,000
My eyes are open to reality.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
In my life, 
I am guided by my decisions.

54
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,000
I have no rules.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,560
My personality 
is like riding a wave.

56
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,530
So let me surf for a moment.

57
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,230
This is the ultimate challenge.

58
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,800
Les Cols Blancs

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,630
against the Labor Blues

60
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,900
against the Colorless.

61
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,230
I always wanted to be the boss.

62
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,130
And I'm here 
to win the million.

63
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,230
Quick money, easy women, flowing 
champagne. Serious?

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
I don't want people to think I 
'm dangerous.

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,930
I want people to think I'm here 
to enjoy the beaches.

66
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,800
No, I want to beat you at Survivor.

67
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,500
Which way of life will prove 
most useful?

68
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,530
People see me 
as a big pile of meat,

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,860
but in the competition, I am 
a tenderloin and they are low cuts.

70
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,900
In the end, only one will win 
the million dollars.

71
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,760
Let's go.

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,400
39 days,

73
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
18 people,

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,930
1 Survivor!

75
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,060
As a Survivor fan, 
this is my life's dream.

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,200
I've wanted to be in Survivor 
since I was 16.

77
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,430
Ten years of applications. 
But I've never been so ready.

78
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,130
It's fate!

79
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,000
War of the Worlds.

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,730
You have been divided 
into three groups,

81
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,400
based on your professions 
and approaches to life.

82
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,660
What we will discover 
in this season,

83
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,830
which of these divisions 
is most appropriate for Survivor.

84
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,900
The Yellows, you are the White Collars.

85
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,760
Professionally, you 
usually have a position of authority.

86
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,560
Your approach to life 
is similar.

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,360
You like to decide 
and be in control.

88
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,330
White collar workers tend 
to make the rules.

89
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,660
Behind, in the center, 
what is your name?

90
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,000
Does that seem like it to you? 
Office environment, authority?

91
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,800
Typically. I like giving 
goals to a team.

92
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,060
In general, the best way 
to do this is to lead.

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,860
I work at the most ruthless talent 
agency in the world.

94
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,860
Going from the urban jungle 
to the real jungle will not be a problem.

95
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,860
The Blues, that's good, 
you are the Blues of Work.

96
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,260
Professionally, your job 
is usually physical.

97
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,660
You earn your living on a daily basis.

98
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,460
You don't always make the rules.

99
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,660
Most of the time, 
you follow those of others.

100
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,660
- The guy in the cap, your name? 
- My name is Dan.

101
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,300
Does this description of the Overalls 
correspond to you?

102
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,160
For sure!

103
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,660
- Are you with your brothers? 
- Brothers and sisters, absolutely.

104
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,830
We built the heart of America.

105
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,460
Blood, sweat 
and tears, calluses on the hands,

106
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,260
ache everywhere at the end of the day.

107
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,400
But smiling, knowing that we had 
a good day's work.

108
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,360
And Madame, in front, with the necklace? 
What is your name?

109
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,500
- Lindsey. 
- Lindsey, okay with that?

110
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,060
The winner of this show 
is on this mat.

111
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,030
Good. This brings us to the Reds.

112
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,330
You are the Colorless, 
the free spirits.

113
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,860
Your professions are often 
determined by your passions.

114
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,330
You don't really make the rules, 
nor do you follow them.

115
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,360
The Colorless tend 
to break the rules.

116
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,900
The guy behind. 
What is your name?

117
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,960
- You already kiss that, right? 
- 100%.

118
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,930
As soon as I saw these people, 
I knew it was my family.

119
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,800
How is it possible, 
just by looking at a band...

120
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,600
The first smiles you see.

121
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,460
This free smile that 
I live with and want to live with.

122
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,500
Without following anyone's rules.

123
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,400
The guy in front. 
What is your name?

124
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,830
Considering your group, 
do you feel like you belong?

125
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,700
Yes. I am a mover. I move 
stuff for office people.

126
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Hot tubs, all the stuff 
lazy people don't want to move.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,200
I work hard, 
see, I'm burly.

128
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,630
It's my thing. Work hard, 
play harder.

129
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,130
You think I'm a mover, 
but I'm not anymore.

130
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,100
I use my brain 
to play people.

131
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,430
I am a manipulator, 
a seller. It's my thing.

132
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,830
Every day I have to sell myself 
to make money.

133
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,000
White Collars, you seem 
to be boiling over getting into the discussion.

134
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,430
The woman in yellow, your name?

135
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,030
- Carolyn. 
- You shake your head.

136
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,730
They tarnish our image.

137
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,100
We work just as hard, 
and we're just as free-spirited

138
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,530
than anyone here.

139
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,930
The guy behind, your name?

140
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,860
How 
about being among the White Collars?

141
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,800
It's okay with me.

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,600
I wouldn't choose any other tribe.

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,860
My 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. does not define me.

144
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,060
Well said.

145
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,530
Judging by appearances 
can be very expensive.

146
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,730
Let's talk about serious things.

147
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,460
White Collars, 
now choose a representative.

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,400
Choose someone.

149
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,630
A volunteer?

150
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,260
Jeff asked for a volunteer 
to make a heavy decision.

151
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,630
One thing I learned 
while studying this game,

152
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,960
is that the worst mistake to make 
is to take a leadership role.

153
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,700
- Joaquin? 
- Yeah.

154
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,560
Come on, get off the mat.

155
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,400
There, it's good. Perfect.

156
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,530
The Blues, the same. 
Choose a representative.

157
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,030
Who wants to do it?

158
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,030
I say... Wisdom.

159
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,530
The Blues, who will it be?

160
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,660
Dan, comfortable with this choice?

161
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,460
It's a double edged sword, 
it can be good or bad.

162
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,660
Dan, take a few steps forward.

163
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,960
Well, the Colorless, 
who will represent you?

164
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,800
What do you think?

165
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,640
- You want me to? 
- It's okay with me.

166
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,200
- Can you get us sandwiches? 
- Sandwiches?

167
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,330
- What's your name? 
- Will.

168
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,830
What a surprise, 
that they have trouble deciding!

169
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,030
Well, the Colorless, 
who will it be?

170
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,060
They can't decide!

171
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,600
Jeff, send them a White Collar 
to fix this!

172
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,100
We've made up our minds, Jeff! 
We have a decision!

173
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,960
But we are not offended. 
It passes us by.

174
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,060
- So who for the Colorless? 
- Will.

175
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,430
The woman in front, your name?

176
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,460
- Jenn. 
- Jenn, why Will?

177
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,330
He promised us sandwiches, 
we chose him for that.

178
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,560
- Are you going to make sandwiches? 
- Yeah!

179
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,400
With what?

180
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,630
Resources 
abound there.

181
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,730
From the ocean, 
are you going to make sandwiches?

182
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,060
It will be cool!

183
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,160
We'll have a whole display of food.

184
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,530
- You maintain this. 
- We are like that.

185
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,660
Oh my God!

186
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,560
Will, come on.

187
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,730
Last year, 
one of my hardcover videos,

188
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,600
it featured my wife dancing 
and singing at a gas station.

189
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,060
The video liked because sometimes 
people are too serious

190
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,000
and do not take advantage 
of this kind of opportunity.

191
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,430
Live in the moment, lower 
your guard and have fun!

192
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,900
Will, Dan and Joaquin, 
you will choose a 2nd person,

193
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,760
with whom you will make a very 
important decision for the tribe.

194
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,130
Who will join you? 
Choose someone.

195
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,630
Anyone volunteer?

196
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,960
- I do. 
- Yeah?

197
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,000
I do.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,760
- You're the boss. 
- OK.

199
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,200
- What's your name? 
- So.

200
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,630
Being a chef can be 
a tricky position.

201
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,230
- Sure. 
- But you chose to be.

202
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,600
But there are two of us, so if I fall, 
he falls with me, I guess.

203
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,430
- Dan, why Mike? 
- He volunteered.

204
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,530
Without color. Will, you 
picked Jenn pretty quickly.

205
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,860
- Yeah. 
- Why Jenn?

206
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,060
She's a free spirit, 
like everyone here.

207
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,230
I can trust him 
to make the right decision.

208
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,560
Good. The cards.

209
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,030
White collar, your name is Masaya. 
This map will take you home.

210
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,400
Overalls , 
your name is Escameca.

211
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,560
Without Color, 
your name is Nagarote.

212
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,830
Go to your camps.

213
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,700
When you are settled, 
each pair will make a decision.

214
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,400
Good luck! Go for it!

215
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,830
Jeff said "Go to your camps",

216
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,700
and I saw those of the other tribes:

217
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,700
"You white -collar people 
who work in offices..."

218
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,160
"We want to kill them!"

219
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,330
But for me, it's not 
a question of social class.

220
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,660
This is Survivor's War.

221
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,900
I love being Colorless.

222
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,460
I could see in their eyes 
that these people were funny.

223
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,730
I believe that in this tribe, 
the idea, for the moment,

224
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,430
is to play it cushy
 and let it flow.

225
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,260
It's kind of my way of life.

226
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,000
My ears must intrigue you. 
I am completely deaf.

227
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,900
I lost my hearing seven years ago.

228
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,800
I have cochlear implants.

229
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,260
That's how I hear.

230
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,560
They were shocked to find out 
that I am deaf.

231
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,200
I know it will be a disadvantage.

232
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,030
I can only go 110% 
and give it my all.

233
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,930
We are a team, we support you.

234
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,500
- Want to take a ride? 
- Are we moving here?

235
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,000
We must act. We should decide 
together, depending on what it could be.

236
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,800
It could be a choice 
between shelter and food.

237
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Jeff said we should 
make a decision for the tribe.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,900
So before we go, 
- "Let's decide together.".

239
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:31,200
- No. 1. No. 2, tarp, food... 
- We work as a team.

240
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,900
- That's how you win. 
- We have good vibes.

241
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,520
- I see something! 
- I see something!

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,030
"Honesty", "deception".

243
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,320
I knew 
it would be like that.

244
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,700
Well, I read "cheating", 
you read "honesty"?

245
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,030
"If you choose deception, 
you will receive a small bag of beans.

246
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,300
It will only last a few days,

247
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,800
but you also have a clue 
about the immunity idol."

248
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,830
"If you choose honesty, 
you will receive a large beanbag.

249
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,630
This big advantage will also show 
that you can be trusted

250
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,030
and that you should be favored."

251
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,700
If you want to be dishonest,

252
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,830
we can get a clue about the idol 
and the little bag of beans.

253
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,430
Or we can be honest 
with the tribe and take the big bag.

254
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,960
We should take the big bag 
and explain it to them.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,900
We choose for the tribe. 
The choice of the large bag is obvious.

256
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,400
The game is not individual.

257
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
We do the best for the group.

258
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,200
Do you want to play nice 
or play bad?

259
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,060
- You know... 
- How do you want to start?

260
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,560
My heart tells me to be nice, 
but the bad guys win this game.

261
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,500
- But it's too early for that. 
- I agree.

262
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,100
We should have the beans.

263
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,160
- I think so too. 
- Are you sure?

264
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,000
Take the beans. 
We must be fair, this is the beginning.

265
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,500
Alright, let's get the beans!

266
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,660
I lean towards honesty,

267
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:13,700
simply because at this stage of the game, 
cheating, for me, is stupid.

268
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,000
What are you doing?

269
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,630
Focus on 
building camaraderie.

270
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:27,060
In front of us were notes 
"honesty" and "deceit".

271
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,500
The "honesty" note read:

272
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,330
"If you're honest 
and don't take advantage,

273
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,560
you will have a big bag of beans.".

274
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,000
- And we had the beans. 
- It's true?

275
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,860
- Owl! 
- It's too early in the game...

276
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,800
I don't believe 
this is a complete bag.

277
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
I think they took the other.

278
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
It's not a big bag.

279
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,500
What was in the other, 
four beans?

280
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,460
Trust takes time. 
I hope we deserved some

281
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,530
If you give us reason 
to believe you are liars and dishonest,

282
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,660
so be prepared to take it on.

283
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,790
They are shady.

284
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,560
This bag should be 
four times bigger.

285
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,300
They fucked us.

286
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,060
Either they believe us 
or they don't.

287
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,160
There's nothing we can do about it. 
We made the right choice.

288
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,460
- Absolutely. 
- You know what?

289
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,530
We have to deal with it.

290
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,460
- Yeah. 
- You know? I mean...

291
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,760
The hardest part is not juggling.

292
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,860
It's not looking at 
your hands when juggling.

293
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,500
What if I do this?

294
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,160
- We make the presentations? 
- Yeah.

295
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
I'm Joaquin, from New York.

296
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,730
Marketing director 
for a research center.

297
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,960
I am in training. We 
always start with introductions.

298
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,700
My name is Tyler.

299
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,530
Until recently, I was working

300
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,500
at Hollywood's biggest talent agency.

301
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,330
Your name, how long have you been working there, 
what else have you done...

302
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,530
That's kind of what we did. 
We are not ashamed to be white collar.

303
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:59,330
I'm Max, from Southern California. 
I am in research and consulting.

304
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,660
Everyone knew what to do. 
It was settled like clockwork.

305
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,530
What's it gonna be, do 
you think?

306
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,900
Jeff said we should 
walk away and make a decision.

307
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,500
"Lying is hard. Tune 
your violins before you go back to camp."

308
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,300
Frankly...

309
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,260
I know we'll take this. 
But what do we tell them?

310
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,300
And so, we are allied, there?

311
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,030
I think we've been allies ever 
since you stepped forward.

312
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,400
- Otherwise, we can be honest. 
- That's stupid.

313
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,230
It's a stupid decision.

314
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,100
So is cute, really cool, 
down to earth. But seriously!

315
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Who wants to be honest? 
Honest as...

316
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Do you want to make friends 
or win a million? Come on, my pretty.

317
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,400
If there is an advantage, I take it.

318
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,730
And you know you want it too.

319
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,760
Joaquin was really sure. 
At no moment

320
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,230
he didn't want to be honest 
or work with the tribe.

321
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,460
What does your instinct tell you?

322
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,300
OK, let's do it!

323
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,260
Eventually, the instinct 
to take advantage prevailed.

324
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,400
“Near where you quench your thirst, 
you will satisfy your craving for power.

325
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,660
It's tucked away in a corner, 
no need to climb,

326
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,900
your time might have come."

327
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,530
- Where thirst is quenched. 
- So near the well, wherever it is.

328
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,030
Yes, tucked away in a corner.

329
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,260
I love having an edge, 
but that means relying on Joaquin.

330
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,800
And that's a little scary.

331
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,900
You're stuck with me!

332
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,260
I feel like I'm making 
a pact with the devil.

333
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,020
Do you really find 
my story too complicated?

334
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,890
No, it's fine.

335
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,700
If you want to say it, 
that's fine.

336
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,430
We finally decided to cheat. 
We took the clue.

337
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,460
- Are we hiding it? 
- Yeah.

338
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,560
I'm mostly afraid of becoming a target 
for making the wrong decision.

339
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,600
My life in this game could 
crumble around me.

340
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,600
When they return, 
So and Joaquin have a closed bag.

341
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,020
So what was it?

342
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,960
You have been gone for a long time.

343
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
I say. 
We had a kind of dilemma.

344
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,900
It was what?

345
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,200
There were three boxes.

346
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,200
One said "honesty".

347
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,400
Another "deception".

348
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,530
And the third "neutral".

349
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,060
We chose "neutral",

350
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:31,460
because with the other two, 
there was a kind of caveat.

351
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,660
I don't know 
what would have happened.

352
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,330
- Is it rice? 
- Beans.

353
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,300
We wanted to take "honest", but...

354
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,120
We didn't know 
what would happen. To be honest.

355
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,400
Look, might as well be neutral...

356
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,950
That's what we said.

357
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,900
I don't really trust 
So and Joaquin.

358
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,230
I think they have the clue 
on the immunity idol.

359
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,260
But I would do the same.

360
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,730
I can't be mad at 
anyone. It's a game! Hello!

361
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,940
This bag of beans was very small.

362
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes, they lie very badly. 
I don't believe it for a moment.

363
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,960
As a Survivor fan, I know 
it's "honesty" or "cheating".

364
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,030
And they clearly chose 
"deception". So I worry.

365
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,200
So I immediately 
wanted to create links,

366
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,160
see what they thought of me.

367
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,420
See if anyone is ready 
to start something.

368
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,060
I felt good about you from the start.

369
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,460
- I don't know about you, but... 
- Exactly.

370
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,330
- I think we can be strong. 
- Absolutely.

371
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,060
"I'm 
so happy to be here!".

372
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,730
"Me too, my girlfriend!"

373
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,530
- Do you want to do this? 
- Very well.

374
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,600
She was up for it.

375
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,360
I also have 
a very good feeling with Max.

376
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,500
Just on looks. 
Kind of a college hipster.

377
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,380
So and Joaquin are too close.

378
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,920
They clearly know where the idol is.

379
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,290
I spoke with Carolyn this morning...

380
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,530
So and Joaquin become dangerous?

381
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,900
I agree.

382
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,300
From then on, I had a strong bond 
with Carolyn and with Max.

383
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,000
That's three people. 
In a tribe of six!

384
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,700
As long as the three of us know we are united , we can move forward.

385
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,460
Crab on the menu!

386
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,900
Got it, got it!

387
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,400
We are working blues. 
We saw the work to be done

388
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,100
and we all got into it. 
It's going to work. We are like that.

389
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,770
They light a fire.

390
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,400
And here comes the fire!

391
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,060
We started a fire 
in less than two hours.

392
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,060
The work blues tear everything apart.

393
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,160
- I like your tattoos. 
- Thanks.

394
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,000
Is it just artistic or...?

395
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,230
This arm is family stuff. 
And on my leg, a drawing of the ocean.

396
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,700
I'm really 
happy with my tribe.

397
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,000
There's a tattooed girl, 
and I like it,

398
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,700
because if you have so many 
tattoos on your body,

399
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,630
it's because we want to express ourselves.

400
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,600
It facilitates the first contact.

401
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,240
- Do you want to read it? 
- "Dear Natalie...

402
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,660
Even though I'll never see you again,

403
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,400
you will always be my big sister. 
I like you. Bubba."

404
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,000
- Did you lose your sister? 
- Yes, two years ago.

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,860
She lived downstairs.

406
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,160
I knock on his door on a Monday.

407
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,000
His car isn't here to go to work. 
I wonder what's going on.

408
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:39,230
No way to open the door, 
I broke a window.

409
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,100
I found her face down, 
with blood all around.

410
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,300
I found my sister 
in her blood two years ago.

411
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,500
When I arrived, I knew I could 
touch the girls with this story.

412
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,660
It is reinforced by this tattoo, 
which also tells it.

413
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,430
They know that I am telling the truth, 
that I am sincere.

414
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,500
- Maybe we'll be your family. 
- Absolutely.

415
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,260
My strategy, from day 1: 
catch the girls.

416
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,000
Girls want to sit down 
and let a man lead.

417
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,130
So I want to catch the girls, 
be their leader and take them to the merge.

418
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,200
I pick up a piece of bamboo 
and there is a scorpion.

419
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,900
It's not huge, but it can 
surely do some damage with a sting.

420
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,000
- You want to eat it, you psycho? 
- Oh yeah! I'm starving!

421
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,930
Protein!

422
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,330
So I cut off his tail...

423
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,890
Here he is harmless.

424
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,400
Are you going to eat 
this thing full of sand?

425
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,700
Yeah, that's a first.

426
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,200
How does it taste?

427
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,160
Bam! Bottoms up! 
It was disgusting.

428
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
T'es taré!

429
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,000
Did you eat a scorpion?

430
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,730
This is not good.

431
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,900
When you starve tonight,

432
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,900
and I'll have a scprion 
in my stomach, don't blame me.

433
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,230
I knew from the start that any 
opportunity to get protein,

434
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,730
I would take it.

435
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,850
But it turns out that 
might not have been the best idea.

436
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,980
Oh, I will...

437
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,620
He vomited?

438
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,360
- How are you? 
- Yeah.

439
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,500
- He vomits? 
- Yeah.

440
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,760
He ate a scorpion.

441
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,400
He pays it.

442
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,030
I'm having trouble there.

443
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,860
Maybe not the best idea.

444
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,900
But I am the type to seize 
the opportunities that present themselves.

445
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,000
I'll run 
as fast as I can

446
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,400
I'll hold 
on as tight as I can

447
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,700
and ride that bull 
as long as I can.

448
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,960
I saw the scorpion, seized the opportunity, 
and paid the consequences.

449
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,030
I am like this.

450
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,560
It's just the weakness 
leaving the body!

451
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Our first coconut!

452
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,400
I wish I had a bongo there.

453
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,600
Too soft.

454
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,100
Les Sans Couleur is 
a great little community.

455
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,460
Everything is going wonderfully.

456
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,300
Everything rolls, Abdul, 
everything slides, Alice.

457
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,900
I want to kiss 
everyone. I am so happy.

458
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,730
Jenn exudes sincerity. 
It makes me feel comfortable. Completely.

459
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,200
Emotionally comfortable, 
physically comfortable. That's great.

460
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
I also had 
feathers in my hair.

461
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,900
Not that it creates an immediate bond, 
- "my people!".

462
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,400
I saw your smile, your beautiful eyes, 
- "instant bond".

463
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,500
Absolutely.

464
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,960
You and me, with our spirit, 
our intelligence,

465
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,100
we could go all the way.

466
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,930
The feathered guy, direct, 
he pulls me aside and says

467
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,730
that he thinks 
we're kindred spirits.

468
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,300
"I like your smile. 
I want to go all the way with you."

469
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,700
It is exactly as 
I imagined it. And maybe more.

470
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,700
If you make friends 
like I do,

471
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,600
breaking a bond is very difficult.

472
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,960
- It's nice to have a person... 
- An anchor.

473
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,860
One of my biggest weaknesses 
is my strong attraction to women.

474
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,530
Jenn brought a bit 
of herself here, and so did I.

475
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,700
And I want to play 
with someone like that.

476
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,100
When I want something, 
I get it.

477
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,700
He plays a little more intensely 
than his feathers would suggest.

478
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,160
Is it worth it

479
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,260
to play at being what he thinks 
I am to him?

480
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,000
For now, it's worth 
having allies, people on your side.

481
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,500
So smiling is my approach 
with Vince, for now.

482
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,400
Let's raise it to that height. 
At least it's not touching the ground.

483
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,200
Vince wanted to make the shelter 
a certain way.

484
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,100
"As you want, man.".

485
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,860
Very "colorless" on my part.

486
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,100
But I have skills 
in this area.

487
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,960
I worked in construction. 
I built a lot of things.

488
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,960
We will use the long bamboos 
for the main frame.

489
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,700
It's just the top of the canopy.

490
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,130
- We mount this and make the frame. 
- It's a lot more work.

491
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,400
We put that over there, 
we put three or four frames.

492
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,000
We put it there. 
I just want to put a roof over it.

493
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,700
I don't really like being told 
something that I know is wrong.

494
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,700
I know what to do 
to make it safe.

495
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,630
So at some point, 
politeness flies away.

496
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,230
You want to put that in, 
so you have less space to fill?

497
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,260
Let's just put it together 
and see what happens.

498
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,660
We're spontaneous, remember? 
The spontaneous tribe.

499
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,460
Let's just continue.

500
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,700
See Joe only want to do it 
his way,

501
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,030
it will surely cause concern. 
We are the Colorless.

502
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,700
We have to collaborate.

503
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,200
Otherwise, it will be a problem.

504
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,400
- It's a bit high. 
- What are we missing?

505
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,160
We need someone 
to make the decisions.

506
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,060
Let's make decisions!

507
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,760
We'll need... 
Three poles, that's what we said?

508
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,930
It's stupid, completely stupid!

509
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,430
- Why are you upset? 
- I'm not mad.

510
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,060
- What are you worrying about? 
- The base is going to be weak.

511
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:41,360
- I just want shelter. 
- It's getting frustrating.

512
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,830
Dan starts to inflate me, 
he climbs quickly in the towers.

513
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,060
He's the only one 
who doesn't belong here.

514
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,760
Bamboo is hollow. 
It won't hold.

515
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,330
The bamboo will break and we will fall.

516
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,400
I'm fat, it doesn't...

517
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,130
This way of speaking... 
I can't stand it.

518
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,100
Dan, given his age, and being a man,

519
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,000
wants to prove to himself that he knows 
what he is talking about.

520
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,100
But he's dealing 
with people in their twenties,

521
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,560
and he's twice their age, 
so he's going to have to listen to them.

522
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,230
But he doesn't have the 
social skills to do that.

523
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,100
It's way too high.

524
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,260
Dan, what do you think?

525
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,830
- You look pensive. 
- Not at all.

526
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,030
- Make a decision! 
- No no no!

527
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,060
I'm the only one who wants that.

528
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,100
And then you change your mind. 
You said below. Make a decision.

529
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,660
I agree, below.

530
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,500
So say it. 
Don't stay silent.

531
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,530
If I say something, they 
yell at me. If I shut up, the same!

532
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,630
- We discussed it before. 
- I agree with you!

533
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,530
It all started with Lindsey.

534
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,960
Then I saw Sierra, Kelly react... 
Now I'm changing tactics.

535
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,330
I stand aside and close it.

536
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,770
Do you want me to stay 
or go get some wood?

537
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,940
As you wish.

538
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
I just want to make myself useful.

539
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,360
I'm going to get some wood.

540
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,130
I can't win.

541
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,630
Because whatever I do now, 
they blame me.

542
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,630
My position in this tribe 
soon became bad.

543
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,300
The bearded man is rather authoritarian.

544
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,700
We need to fire Harry Potter's grandfather .

545
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm not doing well in this game.

546
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,960
It doesn't matter if I want to decide 
or stay away from the decision.

547
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,560
- It's hard. 
- I agree with you.

548
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:41,960
We took it out on you. 
I noticed it today.

549
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:49,500
But don't feel alone. 
I am your friend.

550
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,360
I hear you.

551
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,460
Mike is great. He really wants to 
stay positive. It's a ray of sunshine.

552
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,330
He is the glue 
that holds our unity together.

553
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,860
There's probably a million 
people who wanted to be here.

554
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,300
- And here we are. 
- It's still the best day of my life.

555
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,330
How do you know how to 
light a fire without flint?

556
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,000
I saw this on YouTube,

557
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800
I trained 
every day before coming.

558
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,830
Joe says he knows how to make fire.

559
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,400
OK, Joe, go make a fire!

560
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,060
You say you can do it without flint, 
I'll try to watch you.

561
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,230
I found some coconut shell , do you want some?

562
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,100
Yes, it's great.

563
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,300
- My sweet prince! 
- My princess!

564
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Stop that!

565
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,430
I really like Joe. 
He has a great personality.

566
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,760
He is handsome. 
Tall, muscular...

567
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,830
He should be on the cover 
of romance novels.

568
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,100
Do you need 
us to blow on the wood?

569
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,600
I do not think so.

570
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,730
- "Do you need to be blown on the wood?" 
- I'll enlarge this hole.

571
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:03,500
This game means a lot to me. 
I've always been a big fan.

572
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,430
I said I can make a fire, 
I must ensure.

573
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,600
I see smoke.

574
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,360
Making a fire was 
the best feeling in the world.

575
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,030
It was really good. I scored 
points with the tribe.

576
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:40,300
- Need some water? I go. 
- If you agree.

577
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,160
I already have a thing with Jenn,

578
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,260
but she seems to want 
to ride Joe's wave.

579
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,700
It worries me, 
because I don't trust him.

580
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,060
So I have to dig 
this relationship with Jenn,

581
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,200
get a good idea 
of ​​who she really is.

582
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,790
I want to ask you 
a real human question.

583
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,100
Do you feel closer to Joe?

584
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,460
I don't flirt.

585
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,230
- He doesn't appeal to you? 
- Nope.

586
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,030
- Not even a little? 
- Nope.

587
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,860
I think Vince is jealous.

588
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,600
"So, do you like Joe?".

589
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,060
- But you love him... 
- I love him as a person.

590
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,900
Just like you.

591
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,330
It's not that 
I prefer him to you, not at all.

592
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:40,360
He apparently has a thing 
for me and he suffers from it.

593
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,760
But I think I 
know how to handle it.

594
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,200
It's you and me.

595
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,130
- Do you still want it? 
- Yes.

596
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,260
And you? 
Because you freak me out.

597
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,660
You don't seem to want it.

598
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,600
Yes, I really want it.

599
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,160
But I don't see enough evidence.

600
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,300
I really wish Jenn 
was honest. But I don't feel it.

601
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,190
I feel it fake.

602
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,160
Are you less stressed now?

603
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,490
If you give me a hug.

604
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,730
Vince is the most paranoid here.

605
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,430
Dealing with him is not easy.

606
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,460
Calm down! He drives me crazy.

607
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,760
That's a hug!

608
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:30,100
And don't hug me 
for ages. We stink!

609
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,360
OK? We stink. 
Don't put that under my nose.

610
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,100
Our lovely home!

611
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,200
It doesn't look like anything.

612
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,530
It's not so bad. We have a roof.

613
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,700
We're going to work on it today.

614
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,300
The shelter is very ordinary.

615
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,600
I had probably 
never slept so badly.

616
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,000
- What kind of shelter do you want to build? 
- I would like a good mattress.

617
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,400
Our tribe is white collar people 
giving orders.

618
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,460
But we're gonna have 
to roll up our sleeves

619
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,060
and put us there with the 
professional ethics of the Blues of Work.

620
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,560
Let's make a plan.

621
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,600
Repair the shelter 
and focus on the fire.

622
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,560
Yes good idea.

623
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,630
- I'm going to slip in there, 
- Yes.

624
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,230
This place lacks coverage.

625
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,360
- It's coming? 
- Nope.

626
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,800
What are we doing wrong? 
Go on!

627
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,160
Who knew it would be 
so hard to make a fire?

628
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,630
No one knows how to make a fire. 
None of us.

629
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,400
Why would we know? 
White Collars!

630
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,360
We hire a blue worker 
to light a fire for us.

631
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,200
I just need two minutes.

632
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,760
We won't have the fire.

633
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,530
But it's not big deal. 
I'll go get the idol.

634
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,360
When So and Joaquin came back 
with that bean bag,

635
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,400
I understood 
that they had a clue.

636
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,700
So I watched them closely,

637
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,500
because if they are looking there, 
she may be there.

638
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,960
So, it was obvious, she searched 
this tree desperately.

639
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,460
From previous seasons, I've learned 
what kind of stuff to look for.

640
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,660
It's bound to be something 
that looks different.

641
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,830
I saw this funny tree, 
and I thought... Good.

642
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,720
The perfect place 
for a damn idol.

643
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,300
I have the idol!

644
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,160
Oh my God!

645
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,060
I open it and... 
"You found the immunity idol."

646
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,330
What is magic,

647
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:22,030
is that everyone thinks 
So and Joaquin have the clue,

648
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,830
and they are all still searching. 
It's hilarious!

649
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,830
Over here, everyone!

650
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,100
Ready for your first 
immunity test?

651
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,030
Fart!

652
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,300
Today, you will go down a ramp, 
cross an obstacle,

653
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,860
to a large crate 
containing a ladder.

654
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,960
You will have a choice:

655
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,100
open padlocks with keys 
or undo knots.

656
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,060
Both will release the ladder.

657
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,030
With it, you will climb, cross 
and descend from a platform

658
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,000
to another series of obstacles.

659
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,230
With the scale, you will then make 
the most important decision of the test:

660
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,760
what a puzzle to solve.

661
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,260
There are three choices.

662
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,230
The first puzzle 
has only five pieces,

663
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,230
but it requires 
knowing how to take a step back.

664
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:47,130
If you are able, 
you will solve it very quickly.

665
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,760
The second puzzle has ten pieces.

666
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,060
It asks to see things 
more visually.

667
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,100
If that's how you think, 
it'll be a piece of cake.

668
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,930
The last puzzle 
- 50.

669
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,430
But it is also the most obvious.

670
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,900
The only problem with this puzzle 
is 50 pieces.

671
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:13,530
They all require on average 
the same time of realization.

672
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,700
By choosing the right person 
and the right puzzle,

673
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,560
you can finish 
way faster than average.

674
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,060
The first two tribes 
to finish win immunity.

675
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,400
Here is the immunity idol.

676
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,260
If you have the idol, 
you are safe from voting.

677
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,400
You will not go to the council 
and cannot be eliminated.

678
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,100
The first tribe to finish wins this.

679
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,260
The second tribe to finish wins this.

680
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,130
Both have the same meaning.

681
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,760
The losers will go to the council,

682
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,700
where someone will be the first to be eliminated 
- The War of the Worlds.

683
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,400
You are also playing for a reward. 
Want to know what's at stake?

684
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,360
This will be really useful to you.

685
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,260
A huge fire-making kit.

686
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,730
Not as much, 
but still effective. Flint.

687
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,660
Big stakes, and the right 
to show off from the start.

688
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,530
One minute to get organized 
and we'll get started.

689
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,730
On and go!

690
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,260
This is the first trial 
- The War of the Worlds.

691
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,230
For reward and immunity! 
Survivors, ready?

692
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,060
All attack the straw!

693
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,960
You have to lift your legs 
on this second obstacle!

694
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,700
- How are you? 
- Yeah.

695
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,600
Not as simple as it sounds!

696
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,930
A person on that scale 
now.

697
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:03,160
The three tribes chose the keys 
to unlock the padlocks.

698
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,260
No one took the knots.

699
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,430
It's Vince for the Colorless.

700
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,200
Lindsey for the Labor Blues.

701
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,860
- One turn and you change! 
- And Joaquin for White Collar.

702
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,330
20 keys. Three work 
for three different padlocks.

703
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,160
You can change at any time.

704
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,000
Joaquin hands over to So, 
who attacks the knots.

705
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,760
First change strategy.

706
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,100
Lindsey pulls out 
and sends Mike over the knots.

707
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,160
Come on, Vince, come back!

708
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,930
Vince waives on the keys. 
He puts Joe on the knots.

709
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,000
Big changes right away!

710
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,200
The three tribes 
are not afraid to change.

711
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:53,760
So is on the 
white collar knots, and she's going for it.

712
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,930
Mike is on his fifth knot. 
Joe on his sixth.

713
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,130
Joe made up a lot of time 
for the Colorless.

714
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,400
Joe, you ski lifts!

715
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,860
Its good.

716
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,360
So, always in the lead. 
Mike tries to catch up with her.

717
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,060
Joe, in second place 
for the Colorless.

718
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,760
It's okay, Mike, don't panic!

719
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,530
The Blues of Work 
are quickly outdistanced.

720
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,300
Last node for So. 
Open!

721
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,600
Free that ladder and go!

722
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,200
The White Collars are in the lead.

723
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,100
Last knot for Joe. And There you go! 
Open, the Colorless!

724
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,660
Grab that ladder and forward!

725
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,260
It's White Collar, Colorless 
and Overalls.

726
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,100
Another five knots for Mike. 
It's not over, give it your all!

727
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,360
There are three stages.

728
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,730
Climb, cross, descend. 
White is now crossing.

729
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,930
The Colorless are mounted.

730
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,530
Overalls 
are still on the knots.

731
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,260
- It's okay, Mike! 
- Do not panic!

732
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,930
The White Collars have come down.

733
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,000
The Colorless fall a lot.

734
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,860
The White Collars are now negotiating 
this new obstacle together.

735
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,600
You have to slide the ladder 
through the gaps.

736
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,830
Mike finishes the last knot 
for the Blues.

737
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,760
The Overalls 
have their scale.

738
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,200
It's neck and neck.

739
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,430
The White Collars have passed 
the first phase.

740
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,600
Come on, we can do it!

741
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,400
The work blues are mounted. 
They must cross and come back down.

742
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,530
The Colorless lead. 
The White Collars are second.

743
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,800
The Blues are trying to come back up.

744
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,960
The Colorless have cleared 
the second hurdle.

745
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,060
Now the big decision. 
Which puzzle will they choose?

746
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,630
The White Collars have passed. 
They will choose their puzzle.

747
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,400
Come on, work blues!

748
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,860
5, 10 or 50 pieces. Choose!

749
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,730
The Colorless opt 
for the middle puzzle.

750
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,400
The visual puzzle.

751
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,930
- Which? 
- 50, 50!

752
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,160
White Collars choose 
the simplest with the most coins.

753
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,700
Surprising, for these intellectuals!

754
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,630
Jenn. As expected, the Colorless 
went with the visual puzzle.

755
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,730
No pressure, baby!

756
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,530
Shirin takes on the logic puzzle, 
where there are no surprises.

757
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,400
They will never get there.

758
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,900
Lord, I'm sorry.

759
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,300
The working blues collaborate.

760
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,660
Jenn is already withdrawing. 
Joe's turn.

761
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,560
Joe is on the puzzle 
and he has the first piece.

762
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,430
Shirin works fast, tries 
to figure out what this puzzle is.

763
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,300
When you understand that, 
it will go very quickly.

764
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,060
The work blues have passed. 
Choose your puzzle!

765
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,060
Third piece for Joe.

766
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,030
You have to go up.

767
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,530
The Blues don't understand 
what to do with the ladder!

768
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,900
- Hold it! 
- Their delay is increasing!

769
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,500
Joe skims over this difficult puzzle,

770
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,500
while Shirin struggles 
with a seemingly simpler puzzle.

771
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,200
- The one in the middle! 
- My fingers, my fingers!

772
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:19,230
Rodney picks up the ten-piece puzzle, 
which requires a different perspective.

773
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,560
Another room for Joe.

774
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,660
- Shirin, are you okay? 
- I know what it is, but...

775
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,000
Another room for Joe.

776
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,800
The Colorless 
are very close to the goal.

777
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,060
Three pieces left for Joe.

778
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,700
No, more than two 
for the Colorless!

779
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,500
A huge win right from the start.

780
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,600
Joe only needs one piece to 
win

781
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,830
the first test 
- The War of the Worlds.

782
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:50,460
It is done! The Colorless 
gain reward and immunity!

783
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,360
There is still a place!

784
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,630
Sierra placed a first piece.

785
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,560
His tribe helps him a lot.

786
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,260
Shirin starts to panic, 
she has made very little progress,

787
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,100
on what should be 
the simplest puzzle.

788
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,930
Without color! Without color!

789
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,100
- Intervene! 
- Shirin, frankly!

790
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,060
Shirin se retire, Max se lance.

791
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,600
Sierra, let me take your place!

792
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,060
Sierra retreats, Mike launches.

793
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,700
Losers go to the board. 
Nobody wants that.

794
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,760
- Take a step back! 
- Second room for Mike.

795
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,130
It's okay, Mike! Immunity 
is ours if you get there!

796
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,230
It's Mike versus Max.

797
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:33,830
Return it!

798
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,330
Third piece for Mike.

799
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,130
Work Blues. 
What a mouthful.

800
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,830
Mike is progressing well, 
where Shirin was failing.

801
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,600
Will he have time to finish?

802
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,960
50 pieces 
is a lot more than 10.

803
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,130
- Come on, baby! 
- This is where we come back, baby!

804
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:52,060
The Blues were far behind, they fully returned. 
809th

805
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,360
- We need that immunity! 
- Come on, Max!

806
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,530
Max has done a third of the puzzle. 
But will it be too little, too late?

807
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,360
Two pieces left for Mike.

808
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,160
I'm in the...

809
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,260
Mike is just one piece 
away from winning immunity

810
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,530
for the Blues, protecting them 
and sending the Whites to the council.

811
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,460
Turn it 180 degrees. 
Yes like this!

812
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,830
And he does!

813
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,360
Worker's Blues gain 
immunity and reward,

814
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,900
sending the White Collars to the council!

815
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,300
Holy comeback, Batman!

816
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,800
- It's never over before the end. 
- It's clear!

817
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,730
Colorless, congratulations.

818
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,800
Immunity is yours. No 
one will leave your tribe tonight.

819
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,360
Overalls, no 
one will leave your tribe.

820
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,030
Without Color, come take 
your reward and leave.

821
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,030
Good work.

822
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,800
Overalls, 
it's not a big kit,

823
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,800
but it will do the job. 
Here is a flint.

824
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,500
Take your things, return to camp. 
No advice for you tonight.

825
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:17,360
White collar, one of you will be 
the 1st eliminated at tonight's council.

826
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,700
A very interesting 
afternoon awaits you.

827
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,160
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

828
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,100
Oh my God! 
This ordeal was a disaster.

829
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,860
A desaster. 
We led almost the whole way.

830
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,960
Shirin and Carolyn were 
clearly the weak links.

831
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,500
We were leading.

832
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:57,860
We started the puzzle in 1st, 
and from there, it went on a lollipop.

833
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,360
Shirin said from the start 
that she was good at puzzles.

834
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,960
But we lost.

835
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,230
Which is not a problem, 
because you have to refine yourself, right?

836
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,860
Want to discuss it?

837
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,730
We all know what to do, 
but no one wants to start.

838
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:19,360
- Do we establish a schedule? 
- That's so White Collar!

839
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,430
It will be a girl tonight, 
we all know that.

840
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,360
I'm going to fetch water. 
I need 17 glasses.

841
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,300
Because everyone will realize 
that girls are weaker.

842
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,860
We all like each other, 
but one of us is leaving tonight.

843
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,700
As simple as that.

844
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,460
- We seize the opportunity? 
- Yes.

845
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,300
First of all, you tore 
in your part of the test.

846
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,360
It was just untying knots. 
What do you think, what is your...?

847
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,600
Who planted us? She.

848
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,170
Actually, 
it's not my idea. Shirin?

849
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,230
- Are you thinking of her? 
- I thought it was your idea.

850
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,600
Don't get me wrong. 
I'm pissed at Shirin.

851
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,700
She speaks a lot. 
But she knows how to make herself heard.

852
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,700
Carolyn was happy 
to do nothing.

853
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,060
She didn't want to get involved.

854
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,730
As a businesswoman, I expect 
people to deliver.

855
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,860
If you don't insure, 
it's a problem.

856
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,600
Let's go for a walk.

857
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:20,060
Yes, Shirin was physically weak 
and failed on the puzzle.

858
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,930
Carolyn plays it safe. 
She doesn't volunteer.

859
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,060
So I'm leaning towards Carolyn.

860
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:30,500
If we say Carolyn, 
I can convince Joaquin.

861
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:34,260
The hard part is convincing 
the three guys to vote Carolyn.

862
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,700
Carolyn, how are you?

863
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,580
- Carolyn, are you okay? 
- Yeah.

864
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,360
Shirin felt very bad 
about her failure.

865
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,230
Yes. She did her best.

866
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:52,060
What annoys me is that Carolyn 
will never put herself in danger.

867
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,160
She will stay in the middle.

868
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,500
It can work wonders 
in this game.

869
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,900
So worries me.

870
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,630
She left to chat 
with everyone.

871
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,060
To keep the tribe strong, 
you have to target the weakest link.

872
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,660
They might want to take me out 
because I'm the oldest.

873
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,060
So who are you voting for?

874
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,460
I know you are thinking 
of Shirin or me.

875
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,420
I do not believe that.

876
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,660
Me, yes.

877
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,230
I already have someone in mind. 
I've made my decision.

878
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,930
- I'm very... 
- Your name didn't come up.

879
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,730
Are you saying I'm not 
in danger tonight?

880
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:32,930
Not from me.

881
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,970
Word of New Yorkers.

882
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,500
- And I vouch for it. 
- It's okay with me.

883
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,760
White collar workers tend 
to know when someone is lying.

884
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,730
And I think So lied 
about the clue about the idol.

885
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,000
I don't trust him.

886
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,930
She plays with me 
like the others.

887
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,030
There, I do not feel calm.

888
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:03,000
Voila. Don't freak out, 
but your name has come up.

889
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,300
But I want strength, 
and you showed yours.

890
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,730
Lord. I knew I was targeted 
and that So was involved.

891
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:16,730
I think So suggested my name.

892
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,660
It has to be a girl, 
because guys are stronger.

893
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,060
So if it's not me, 
it's one of those two.

894
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,430
- And the idols? 
- I don't think any of them have it.

895
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,700
- I know it. 
- Because?

896
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,760
I have the idol. 
I bring it to the council.

897
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,730
There may be 
absolutely no reason,

898
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,960
without even discussing it further, 
so that you have to play it.

899
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,260
I have the hidden idol, so I know 
I'm not leaving tonight.

900
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,160
But I don't want to 
use it tonight.

901
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,260
I want to go there, 
sure it won't be me.

902
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,460
So I have to get So out.

903
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,900
So militates for me to go out. 
I say it must be her.

904
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:04,760
I think we should vote So.

905
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,930
Shirin, Carolyn and I have been playing 
cards since day one.

906
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,600
Above all, I want 
to be sure that I am in the majority.

907
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,400
She targets me, I vote against her.

908
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,660
The names mentioned for tonight 
are Carolyn and So.

909
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,230
Carolyn stands out for her age.

910
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,560
That kind of little difference

911
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,800
can put you aside 
in a small tribe of six.

912
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:36,500
On the other side, there is So. 
She got in trouble

913
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:41,060
by lying to the tribe 
about the choice made with joaquin.

914
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,000
What do you say?

915
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,760
You have to take the temperature 
with the balèze. He is the unknown.

916
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,000
There's the three of us, there's 
So and Joaquin, and there's the hefty guy.

917
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,560
What do you think of the situation?

918
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:02,300
On the one hand, you have people 
who have lied to their teammates.

919
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:07,400
But it's complicated by the fact 
that So has insured on the knots.

920
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:10,600
On the other side, 
when I think of trust,

921
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,660
Carolyn thinks she's off to a bad start, 
but I only think well of her.

922
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,160
My point of view,

923
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,260
is that we need a majority 
and hard-working and loyal people.

924
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,230
If only the physical 
were taken into account tonight,

925
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,230
that would be Carolyn,

926
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,360
because she's the oldest.

927
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,000
I look small, 
but I'm very strong.

928
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:36,460
Moreover, if integrity takes precedence, 
So will be in the sights.

929
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,160
But Carolyn scored points 
for telling me she has the idol.

930
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,200
I don't think I 
have to play it tonight.

931
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,260
Logic dictates 
that Carolyn should leave first.

932
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,860
I know how 
dangerous the idol can be.

933
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,030
Both outcomes 
are possible tonight.

934
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:56,000
But I'm sure 
someone will be shocked.

935
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,860
Behind you, torches.

936
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,130
Grab one 
and light it in the fire.

937
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,200
It is part 
of the council ritual,

938
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:49,430
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

939
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,960
If your fire goes away, so do you.

940
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,230
Let's talk about the first dilemma.

941
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,800
Joaquin, you were chosen, 
then you chose So.

942
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,730
You then had to make 
a decision for the tribe.

943
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,230
How did it go?

944
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:12,300
There was a "deceit" box, 
a "neutral" and an "honesty".

945
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,260
We chose "neutral".

946
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,200
Shirin, what did you think of all this?

947
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,500
Jeff, I'm a huge fan of the show.

948
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,130
It's season 30, 
and their story is shaky.

949
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,800
I think there was a clue 
about the immunity idol

950
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:28,660
and that they weren't honest 
about what happened.

951
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,630
Max, you've known them 
for 5 minutes,

952
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,930
and comes the first 
confidence test.

953
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:38,830
Jeff, I'm not angry or disappointed 
with them for making this decision.

954
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,000
I probably would have done the same.

955
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,530
I would have just lied better.

956
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,060
So, how do you react?

957
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,460
It hurts a little to hear that,

958
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,800
because yet, we four 
are really strong.

959
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:58,030
- And I really hope... 
- Are you four strong?

960
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,500
Oh, that's interesting. 
Who is it?

961
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:05,460
Interesting.

962
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,630
So Carolyn and Shirin, 
you're not in the core of 4,

963
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,930
which is not good 
in a group of 6.

964
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,100
It's bad.

965
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:15,860
- "There is something going on." 
- As a wise man said.

966
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:20,430
Carolyn, how do you react 
to the existence of this core of 4?

967
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,400
I'm the oldest, 
the first one thinks of:

968
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,600
"You will not be able to ensure 
in the tests and the rest.".

969
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:31,400
And yet, Max and Shirin 
have been with me since day 1.

970
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,700
So Max is lying to me?

971
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,330
- I think I'm in danger. 
- In effect.

972
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,930
We were voting for you tonight.

973
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:44,660
- You're the weak link. 
- You told me it was Shirin!

974
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,430
Yes, it had to.

975
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,700
Everyone agreed 
to be told that.

976
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,730
I think you've been lying to me 
since day one.

977
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,930
Yes, I didn't trust you.

978
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:57,260
OK. Good. I don't 
trust you either.

979
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,830
You know these two women 
are the weakest.

980
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:04,830
What is "weak"? 
Because you undid some knots?

981
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:10,230
What a feat! We could all have 
undone a few knots.

982
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,300
Tyler, are you okay?

983
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:17,160
If we took the lead 
in the event, it's thanks to So,

984
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,730
thanks to her concentration, 
she was able to overcome these 20 knots.

985
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,330
It was impressive 
and it kept us in the game.

986
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,430
Ultimately, 
we were trying to be a team,

987
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,460
and me to have a team spirit.

988
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,000
Yes, the game started, and Joaquin 
and I had to make a choice.

989
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,430
We ended up getting caught.

990
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,500
But in the races, 
I'm there for the team.

991
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,600
- I showed it today. 
- Unlike me?

992
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,460
No. You did not offer yourself 
at any time in the test.

993
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,500
You chose safety 
and didn't take the lead.

994
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,100
Oh really?

995
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,130
'Cause I'm getting high on camp.

996
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:57,000
And by the way, I'm 
as sporty as the others.

997
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:02,700
That they want to eliminate me today 
plunges me into perplexity.

998
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,060
Tyler, with only 6 people, 
you better make the right choice.

999
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,000
Jeff, our opponents 
are the others.

1000
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,500
If we choose badly, we will be weaker 
physically, emotionally or...

1001
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,930
In any case, weaker. 
And we'll be right back here.

1002
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:24,530
Max, how are you feeling 
right now, before the vote?

1003
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:27,700
I thank the Survivor gods

1004
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,530
for giving me exactly what I 
was hoping for for my 1st advice,

1005
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:35,600
namely torrential rain 
and drama galore.

1006
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,700
So far you have both.

1007
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:43,230
It's time to vote. 
Joaquin, over to you.

1008
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,300
I didn't trust you from 
the start. You've been lying to me since day 1.

1009
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:04,000
I hope 
it's you and not me tonight.

1010
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,700
The tribe must remain strong. 
You are the lesser evil.

1011
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,600
I will count the votes.

1012
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:43,860
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

1013
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,730
now is the time to do it.

1014
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,530
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

1015
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:59,500
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

1016
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,530
I will read the votes.

1017
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,960
Carolyn. 
Two votes Carolyn.

1018
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,200
So.

1019
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,000
Equality.

1020
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,060
Two votes Carolyn, 
two votes So.

1021
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:25,660
So.

1022
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,630
Three votes So, two votes Carolyn, 
one vote left.

1023
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,030
First person eliminated

1024
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:36,200
White Collars vs Overalls 
vs Colorless...

1025
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,400
So.

1026
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,530
Bring me your torch.

1027
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,060
So, the tribe has spoken.

1028
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,860
It's time to go.

1029
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,960
Good luck!

1030
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,730
You are players.

1031
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:15,860
Do you play well? 
Was it the right decision?

1032
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,130
The future will tell.

1033
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:22,000
You leave with flint.

1034
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,530
Take your things, 
return to camp. Good night.

1035
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,200
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

1036
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,630
Next time in Survivor...

1037
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,240
I'm going swimming, okay?

1038
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,960
A White Collar adopts 
the Colorless mentality.

1039
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,430
Why did our camp 
become a naturist camp?

1040
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,800
What's going on?

1041
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,120
- You mate. 
- No, then really not.

1042
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,930
And Nina goes after her whole tribe.

1043
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,730
Do not touch me!

1044
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:02,500
You would think that my tribe 
would try to make me feel included.

1045
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,430
This moment is my worst nightmare.

1046
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:09,700
I would never have imagined 
coming out first.

1047
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,060
They made a mistake. 
This tribe will destroy itself,

1048
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:17,530
because they eliminated someone 
who is an asset in the trials.

1049
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:18,400
It really hurts.

1050
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,500
I'm just trying to take the shock.
