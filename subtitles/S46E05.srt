00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,890
I'll be honest.
I do have the skull card.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,060
TEVIN:
He literally folded his cards.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,270
And now Maria and myself
both have extra votes.

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,790

Come on.

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,510

Yes!
Survivor bucket list

JEM:
Nobody knows that I found
the Beware Advantage first...

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,480
...and that I actually
have replanted the note.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,310
Aah!

13
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,130
This does not rock.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,170
Done.

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,620
I lost my vote.

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,510

Help me. Help me.

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,620
Help me.

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,200
If this is what You wanted,

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,790
You shouldn't have put me
on Survivorin the first place.

20
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,820
-Help me, Tiff, please.
-No.

21
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,650
Wow. What a plan, man.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,480
BHANU:
I am going home tonight,

23
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,960
but it's not
about the million dollars.

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,100
All I want to do
is win a million hearts.

25
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,480
KENZIE:
You won my heart, Bhanu.

26
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,960
-Mine, too.
-All of our hearts.
-Seriously.

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,030

I'm happy
he told us his story, though.

He's a sweetheart
and an amazing person,

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,680
but that doesn't necessarily

36
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,340
mean you're, like,
the best Survivorplayer.

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,860
-Absolutely.
-And that's the... that's the,

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,100

-Yeah.

TIFFANY: It was a unanimous

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,960
decision that
Bhanu would go home.

41
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,680
We all knew that

42
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,060
we weren't gonna be able
to play the game

43
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,100
we wanted to and teach Bhanu

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,930
how to play the game
at the same time.

45
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,200
We did make a pact
on day one, and

46
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,410
-we're still here together.
-I'm still riding with you.

47
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,890
So, we did something right.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,270
I'm happy
with the three that are left.

49
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,510
Kenzie and Q are my two
closest allies in the game.

50
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,030
At this point,
we just got to win

51
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,100
one immunity challenge, but

52
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
something tells me that's not
how it's gonna go down.

53
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,310
We are the worst tribe
in Survivorhistory.

54
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,580
LOL.

55
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,890
Um...

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,890
We're going into day ten
without fire,

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,270
which I think is a record.

58
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,370
It's definitely affecting all
of us in a multitude of ways.

starting to eat itself.

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,310
get some food and just

62
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,370
have fun.

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,860
Sorry.
I'm just, like, so tired.

64
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,340
Because we, like,
keep losing everything.

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,720
We don't have fire. We don't...

66
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,130
We can't do anything.

67
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,720
It's frustrating.

68
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,580
Ugh. It's just tough.

one of the guys

135

might have
the immunity idol, but

136
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,750
I found a Beware Advantage, and

137
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,440
it's a clue to the idol.

138
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,440
And nobody suspects
that I have anything on me

139
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,440
because I put the Beware
Advantage in another tree

140
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,680
to kind of get the scent off of,
that somebody

141
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,510
already found something.

142
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,100
Where's the damn scroll?

143
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,060
JEM:
It's been
a wild goose chase, and finally,

144
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,000
everybody knows
there's nothing there.

145
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,960
And that played out
to my advantage,

146
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,580
because now the women
are on the same page.

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,860
Either Ben or Tim
are gonna be the next

148

are running the show.

the salsa may seem goofy,

170

but it's all
part of the strategy,

171
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,510
if you think about it, you know.

172
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,100
It's going to be very important
for me to really be in lockstep

173
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,930
with my number one ally, Maria.

174
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,370

to walk the tightrope

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,130
of the middle of this tribe,
and you've got

177
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,000
Tim and Ben on one side
and Jem and Moriah on the other.

178
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,100
So Maria and I
are really in control.

179
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,370
I don't think anyone knows

180
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,240
we're really working
closely together,

181
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,030
and that's so powerful,
so I want to keep it that way.

182
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,130
[all cheering]

183
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,060
LIZ: If everybody's looking,
I guess maybe I should look.

184
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,000
Just got a feeling
that I'm not gonna find it.

185
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,030
There's just so many
nooks and crannies to scour.

186
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,340
-Mm.
-While we're here...

187
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,820
HUNTER: At this point,

188
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,240
getting so close to the merge,

189
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,930
everyone's worried
about the idol.

190
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,480
Everybody's searching
for this thing.

191
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,550
Soda is very blatantly
looking around.

192
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,410
Tevin's out there
with the shovel, digging.

193
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,510
You get that little surge
of excitement

194
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,270
when you see something,
and then...

195
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,680
[blows raspberries]
...nothing.

196
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,060
I have spent so much time
looking for this idol.

197
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,270
I've been digging
and climbing and, like,

198
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,680
going all over the place.

199
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,720
I feel like I'm walking by it,

200
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,370
and, you know,
the camera pans to it,

201
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,650
and ping, there it is,
but you don't see it.

202
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,750
This jungle is so huge,

203
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,170
and there are
so many small crevices.

204
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,100
I want to find the thing, but
it's just like, "Where is it?"

205
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,410
TEVIN:
I don't know what the hell
going on with the idol.

206
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,720
I don't know
if there's more than one,

207
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,480
if there's two, if there's
three, if there's none.

208
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,930
So I don't know
where to even look.

209
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,930
And no one seems
to have found it.

210
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,060
I think every person has looked
for the idol except Liz.

211
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,130
LIZ:
I'm just sitting at the shelter.

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,510
I keep telling people,
"I'm not gonna look."

213
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,310
I'm not gonna
search for an idol.

214
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,170
I can barely find my shoes.

215
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,170
SODA:
Looking for an idol
is just so difficult.

216
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,480
It is so dense out here.

217
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,960
It's almost impossible

218
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,130
to scour every little inch.

219
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
There may be one coconut
you don't turn over,

220
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,650
but there's, like,
a million coconuts.

221
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,060
It's exhausting.

222
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,720
And at the same time,

223
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,580
we don't want it to fall
into the wrong hands.

224
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,240
VENUS:
What is that man looking for?

225
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,790
I'm gonna go spoil his fun.

226
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,550
An idol.

227
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,240
In my mind, it's day ten,

228
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,750
and I'm pretty sure
that sucker is found.

229
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,550
And I guess I was wrong
in assuming you found it.

230
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,270
This advantage

231
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,960
has really weighed on my mind
because I know Randen found it.

232
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,000
And he was medevaced
with that Beware Advantage

233
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,480
in his pocket, so, it's probably
back in the game.

234
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,240
Hunter knows this island
better than anyone,

235
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,200
so, Hunter,
if you're finding that idol,

236
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,550
I will find it with you.

237
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,550
I-I'm shameless.
I will literally follow you.

238
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,060
And if I'm annoying you,
I don't care.

239
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,240
It would be near a landmark, no?

240
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,820
I don't know. I mean, in
the other season, it was, like,

241
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,550
tied to the top of a bush,
and then,

242
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,790
in, like, those little cracks
of those things.

243
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,790
And so, I think the era
of the landmark

244
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,370
has kind of, like, passed.

245
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,820
Yeah.

246
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,750
HUNTER:
Venus keeps following me around

247
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,030
as I'm looking for an idol.

248
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,410
So, I automatically
just sit down

249
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,890
and stop searching.

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,790
I don't want her
to know if I find it.

251
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,620
Realistically, Hunter, if we do
go into any kind of merge,

252
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
we have to pick out
who the biggest threat is.

253
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,720
People might be thinking you.

254
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,270
Okay, but you don't think that?

255
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,410
No, I do, but I...

256
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,860
So you want
to vote me out today?

257
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,620
I don't because
I consider you a meat shield.

258
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,030
HUNTER:
Come on, man.

259
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,510
I know that
I am a huge challenge threat.

260
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,270
That's why I'm looking
for idols and stuff.

261
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,750
I wish she would just
leave me alone.

262
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,130
Can you believe
we're halfway through

263
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,550
and we haven't even
started playing?

264
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,790
-It's unheard of.
-It's pretty fun.

265
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,370
Thank you.

266
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,100
-I'm rooting for you.
-I'm rooting for us,

267
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,510
for Nami.

268
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,340
After our really cagey,

269
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,960
awkward conversation,

270
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,240
Venus finally decides
to leave me alone.

271
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,060
And then I can get back
to really looking.

272
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,370
So much time spent looking
for this stupid thing.

273
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,750
And then I see it--
the Beware Advantage.

274
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,270
It's about time.

275
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,890
Oh, golly.

276
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,820
Forget that.
We're looking at it.

277
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,650
I know being the biggest
challenge threat

278
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,510
is making a target on my back.

279
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,480
So I snatched that thing up
as fast as I could.

280
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,100
"Dig directly below the spot

281
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,510
where you found
the Beware Advantage."

282
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,060
Well, I started digging,
and I find a big old box,

283
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,960
and the box has a lock on it,

284
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,100
but there's a little scroll
on it.

285
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,550
And it says, "There is a hidden
immunity idol in this box,

286
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,580
but the box requires a key
to open it."

287
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
Oh, boy.

288
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,960
"The location of the key
will remain a mystery

289
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,240
"until after your tribe loses
a future immunity challenge.

290
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,310
"Once your tribe loses,

291
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,030
"return to this location
to receive further instructions.

292
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,370
"Until you have taken possession
of the idol,

293
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,550
you cannot vote
at Tribal Council."

294
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,030
I do want to have this idol,

295
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,480
but now I have to wait
until my tribe loses?

296
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,370
Looking at the performance
of the other tribes,

297
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,790
it doesn't look like
it's gonna happen very soon.

298
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,370
Thankfully, there's a clause
that says if we don't lose,

299
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,620
I still have an opportunity
to get it.

300
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,960
I know

301
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,410
that I am in trouble
if the merge hits.

302
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,890
I know that I need
as many weapons and tools

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,750
as I can have
going into it, and so,

304
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,930
this could be
game-changing for me.

305
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,650
♪ ♪

306
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,340
Oh, my God.

307
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,100
Q: We have it rough right now,

308
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,510
and we still don't have flint.

309
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,960
And it's rain

310
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,580
just about every day.

311
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,030
Plus, I'm hungry,
I haven't eaten in ten days.

312
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,060
And sleeping on the bamboo,
sitting on the bamboo,

313
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,030
hell, even looking
at the bamboo at this point--

314
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,650
it's getting on my nerves.

315
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,790
Q:
No tree mail.

316
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,200
TIFFANY:
I'm sure he's fine.

317
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,370
KENZIE:
We've gone through hell.

318
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,580
We're the only tribe,
on day ten,

319
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,820
who has even stepped foot
into Tribal Council.

320
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,030
And for Tiff and I,
it's almost comical.

321
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,680
What will Yanu lose today?

322
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,410
[both laughing]

323
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,440
KENZIE:
But we are in a tough spot,

324
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,890
and it just seems to be getting
tougher and tougher.

325
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,440
And Q is starting
to get, like, really down.

326
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,340
KENZIE:
We can make it.

327
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,860
We've, like,
already fought so hard,

328
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,480
and I don't see
either one of us,

329
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,580
like, stopping anytime soon.

330
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,510
-What?
-I might.

331
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,510
-Stop?
-Say ...

332
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,890
[laughs]

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,410
-KENZIE: Don't say that.
-Q: I already told you.

334
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,790
KENZIE:
Are you serious about that?

335
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,890
-Yeah.
-Like, you would
just want to go?

336
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,860
It's not giving up.
It's accepting.

337
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,030
KENZIE:
This morning, I could tell
something was off.

338
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,930
So now, Q has thrown himself
on the sword.

339
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,790
He's telling us
he's ready to go.

340
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,170
If someone's saying,
"Send me home,"

341
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,930
that's one step closer
for me to the end.

342
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,370
Let's just win.

343
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,370
Q:
It's tempting
to just give up and go home,

344
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,440
but I would never do that.

345
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,440
The reality

349

Let's just take a moment,

00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,860

00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,620
What is that feeling right now,

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,340
Tiff, to be holding that idol?

718
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,410
Honestly... [exhales]

about right now is that

freezing cold tomorrow.

Kenzie, what's the feeling?

726
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,030
It's been a very long
losing streak for Yanu.

727
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,030
KENZIE:
This feeling is new to us.

728
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,680
All we really know is losing,

729
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,060
and we have lost
half of our tribe.

730
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,750
So the fact that
we get to keep us together,

731
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,130
like some semblance of Yanu
moving forward, it's...

732
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,170
You know, we were preparing
for the worst this morning.

733
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,480
We were like, "What if
we have to go down to two?"

734
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,580
Because that's all we knew.

735
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,200
So this is just
a little bit of security

736
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,620
in a game
where we haven't had any.

737

Okay.

855
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,130
Let's just see what all we got.

856
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,170
The journey is an opportunity
to test mySurvivor knowledge.

857
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,030
There's this long table,

858
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,860
and you've got
to put 20Survivor logos

859
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,030
in chronological order.

860
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,030
I'm a pretty big fan, but

861
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,100
when I watchedSurvivor,

862
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,680
my college roommate

863
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,130
was the one
who introduced it to me.

864
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,960
And he just
showed 'em to me in order

865
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,030
of seasons that he likes,
not in chronological order.

866
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,890
And so I was like, "Oh, boy.

867
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,890
This is not gonna be easy."

868
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,340
Well, we know that one.

869
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,340
But I recognizeBorneo,
season one.

870
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,930
Boom.
First one right there.

871
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,200
Let's just start
putting these in, at least.

872
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,370
I recognize quickly
Pearl Islands

873
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,680
because you have Sandra
and you have Rupert.

874
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,440
Yes!

875
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,750
HUNTER:
All fromPearl Islands.

876
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,790
That was number seven,
right before All-Stars.

877
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,170
We know Parvati
played in Cook Islands,

878
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,650
before Tocantins,

879
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,270
because Parvati had won
by Heroes vs. Villains.

880
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,060
And so we know
it'sCook Islands

881
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,340
and then Caramoan.

882
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,270
We keep going.
I rememberTocantins,

883
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,170
which is Tyson,
like, my favorite player.

884
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,890
I just always smell
like flowers and exotic fruits.

885
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,410
HUNTER:
You haveRedemption Island,
where Boston Rob and them

886
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,650
-come back.
-You gotta hustle

887
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,410
if you want to make a dollar.

888
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,550
HUNTER:
I love those seasons, so
those were pretty easy for me.

889
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,790
Kaôh Rongis, like, the one

890
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,580
where Caleb passed out.

891
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,650
Panamawas before Cook Islands.

892
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,650
I think I've been
doing pretty well.

893
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,060
But, also, it's just fun
to walk down memory lane

894
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,680
and be inspired by all the other
people who have played before.

895
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,890
Eight was All-Stars.

896
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,960
But if this is number seven,
that's not possible.

897
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,860
So we have to figure out
where I'm missing something.

898
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,200
Golly.
This is gonna be impossible.

899
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,130
Why didn't
I watch them in order?

900
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,370
I can look at these logos
and say things that happen

901
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,580
in the season,
but it wasn't questions

902
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,240
about what happened
during the season.

903
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,620
It was a question of the order.

904
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,240
There's a big gap here.
What happens between here?

905
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,130
This is 28. This is 22.

906
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,270
No.

907
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,790
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

908
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,580
But as you sit there,

909
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,650
your brain's not
functioning at full capacity

910
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,930
because you haven't slept well
and you haven't eaten well.

911
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,060
And so you're like,

912
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,000
"I really need you
to, like, really kick in

913
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,130
and tell me the order."

914
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,550
Ooh. Golly.

915
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,310
Also, there's this timer
ticking in your head,

916
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,820
and you're like, "Did Debbie
come back for a Second Chance

917
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,440
or did she come back
for Game Changers?

918
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,270
It's nauseating,
frustrating and I'm pissed!

919
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,960
HUNTER:
Pretty sure she came back
forGame Changers.

920
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,650
And so, as the timer's
running out,

921
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,310
I am as content
as I'm gonna be.

922
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,820
But, you know,

923
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,370
if I miss
even one of these things,

924
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,720
then I lose my vote.

925
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,860
Feel good about these
right here.

926
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,170
I mean, that could be the order.

927
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,370
Oh, dear. Time to flip.

928
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,720
Yeah.

929
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,750
Okay.

930
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,680
Yes. Yes.

931
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,130
Yes.

932
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,890
No. No.

933
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,200
[laughs]:
No. No. No.

934
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,340
No.

935
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,030
I got-I got those way off.

936
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,620
There, there,
there, there, there.

937
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,620
And then switch those two.

938
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,620
Not great.

939
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,960
Eight out of 20. Not great.

940
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,510
That is not a passing grade.

941
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,680
I lost my vote because I didn't
know the order of the logos.

942
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,550
Which sounds terrible,

943

944
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,580

a million dollars.

we have this mysterious

1028
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,620
Beware Advantage lurking about.

1029
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,750
And, oh, yeah,

1030
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,030
everyone has a Shot in the Dark.
Ta-da.

1031
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,310
Everything
could go wrong tonight.

1032
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,960
JEM:
We've never
dealt with this before.

1033
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,680
So I want to go idol hunting,
and I'm not talking as a group.

1034
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,580
-I'm talking, like,
idol hunting.
-Just go do your thing.

1035
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,030
-Okay.
-All righty.
-MARIA: All right.

1036
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,370
Think everybody goes and does

1037
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,790
-whatever they want to do.
-MORIAH: Yeah.

1038
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,000
JEM:
Oh, my God. I don't have
a vote for tonight's Tribal.

1039
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,820
And as soon
as we lost that challenge,

1040
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,200
it just, like, hit me.

1041
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,790
I have to go back
to the place where I found

1042
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,480
the Beware Advantage, because
now I get more information

1043
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,930
to find the key for
the immunity idol in the box.

1044
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,440
Oh, my God. Like, this is crazy.

1045
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,100
I have to go back to camp,

1046
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,310
get the machete
to go measure stuff,

1047
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,890
and I know that I have to do

1048
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,440
three different tasks.
And I'm like,

1049
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,960
"The tribe is right here.

1050
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,650
Like, how am I gonna
get away with it?"

1051
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,550
CHARLIE:
All right, dude,
I'm gonna head out there.

1052
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,510
[whoops]

1053
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,750
JEM:
I have to figure out
how to get my immunity idol

1054
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,720
before tonight's Tribal Council

1055
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,340
or I'm gonna lose my vote.

1056
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,480
Every time I walk this way
or walk that way,

1057
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,000
I kind of
see people in the path.

1058
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,410
And I was like,

1059
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,680
"Jem, you got to go.
This is your moment."

1060
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,960
I have three different places
to measure.

1061
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,510
The tribe's flag.

1062
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,060
I need to also measure

1063
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,060
the perimeter
of the tribe's boat.

1064
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,200
I added it up, and it was 12.

1065
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,060
Tree mail.

1066
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,480
And then finally
the perimeter of tree mail.

1067
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,510
And it's four.

1068
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,860
"Boat times logo
plus tree mail."

1069
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,580
12 times two

1070
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,370
is 24, plus the four is 28.

1071
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,860
I need to go back

1072
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,000
to where I originally found
the Beware Advantage

1073
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,930
and measure 28 machetes
out towards the beach.

1074
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,440
Fear crept into my heart.

1075
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,580
I'm looking to make sure
nobody's coming. And then

1076
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,130
I was like, "Okay. Let's go."

1077
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,200
[quietly]: Please, please,
please, please, please.

1078
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,130
Oh, my God.

1079
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,860
Oh, yeah.

1080
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,170
Hooray. I found it.

1081
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,480
I dig up a rope with a key.

1082
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,240
And that was the moment

1083
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,130
I knew that that's the key
to unlock that box.

1084
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,100
And emotions,
like, overwhelmed me.

1085
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,580
[imitates musical flourish]

1086
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,370
This is my dream
coming out here,

1087
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,650
to find an idol, and I did it,
and nobody has any idea.

1088
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,440
Now I got to make sure
that the women plus Charlie

1089
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,930
are still going strong,

1090
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,410
so there's no way tonight
that Ben or Tim

1091
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,960
is not going home.

JEM:
So what do you think
Tim is gonna come back with?

1094
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,310
He's for sure
coming back with something.

1095
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,680
And I think
he already has something.

1096
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,860
-So how
do we want to vote today?
-MARIA: I don't know.

1097
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,030
How many votes?

1098
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,440
I've got two.

1099
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,200
-I feel really strong.
-I think we put three on Ben

1100
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,890
-and two on Tim...
-MARIA: Yeah, two on Tim.
I agree.

-MORIAH: I like that.

1102
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,100
-But let's talk to Charlie.
-MARIA: Okay.

1103
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,930
We have to go
to our first Tribal Council,

1104
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,820
which means get
my extra vote from the journey.

1105
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,960
And I'm willing to use it
because

1106
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,930
Tim potentially has an idol,
you know?

1107
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,100
So I think
we have to take out Ben,

1108
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,270
and I think we're four strong
with Charlie, and so

1109
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,060
the plan is very foolproof.

1110
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,200
Maria's pretty confident
Tim has the idol.

1111
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,820
So that's why
we're gonna put two on him.

1112
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,240
-So he plays his idol,
and then Ben goes home.
-Yeah.

1113
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,270
Okay.

1114
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,720
Ben is the target.

1115
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,680
Bam. It's like
my heart plummeted in a second.

I've gotten very close with Ben
over the past couple days.

1117
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:13,960
Yeah.

1118
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,550
I'm...

1119
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,130
I know. It sucks.

CHARLIE:
People are talking about Ben

He's a magnetic guy.

He's charismatic. He's funny.
It's true.

You know, people like Ben a lot.
I like Ben a lot.

Ben is an asset.

I didn't get anything.
-BEN: Yeah.

I didn't play.
I didn't get anything.

JEM: In my gut feeling,

1138
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,930
I feel like
Tim is not being truthful

1139
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,620
about the journey.

1140
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,410
And so we want to vote Ben out,
'cause that's just

1141
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,750
an easy vote,
just in case Tim has something.

1142

I know that
Tim doesn't have the idol.

1143
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,130
I have it.

1144
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,860
I'm gonna be bringing it
just in case

1145
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,200
I need to use it tonight,
because I'm so worried.

1146
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,200
Like, Ben and Tim
are up to something big.

1147
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:18,200
So I have
to find out what their plan is

1148
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,790
for tonight's Tribal Council.

I got the gavel.
-Listen...

-Listen, I know...
-Uh-huh?

1151
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,510
...you and Tim have
a really strong relationship.

1152
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,170
-Everybody says that,
but you don't... we don't...
-Listen...

1153
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,270
-Yeah.
-This is Jem, okay?

1154
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:34,820
Okay? Okay?

1155
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,890
-So this is not...
-If you only knew
what we laugh about.

1156
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,440
-I don't care
what you laugh about.
-Okay.

1157
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,960
-But I want to be part
of the laugh is what I'm saying.
-Okay.

1158
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,310
I don't know, dude.

1159
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,060
-You're holding a machete.
[laughs]
-Honestly,

1160
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,550
-but, like, whoever you want
to vote for, like, let me know.
-Yeah.

1161
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,580
I will vote with you,
whoever you guys think.

1162
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,060
-Please, tell me, honestly.
I'm all about honesty.

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,440
-Yeah.
-BEN: Jem corners me.

1164
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,580
She's trying
to get some information,

1165
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,790
'cause she's gunning for me.
You just know when you know.

1166
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,510
She's holding the machete.
So I grab the hammer.

1167
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,240
I'm, like,
trying to hold my space.

1168
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,680
-Tonight is do-or-die. Yeah.
-I know. It's do-or-die.

1169
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,200
And I will not flip.

1170
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,860
-I'm looking you
straight in the eyeballs.
-I know.

1171
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,680
I'm not blinking,
and I wouldn't flip.

1172
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,860
-Trust in your gut.
-It's, like...

1173
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,270
She's like, "Go with your gut."

1174
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,930
And my gut is telling me
Jem's playing at all costs

1175
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,200
and if we keep her around,
she's just gonna

1176
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,790
screw us at the next vote,
because she's so, like...

1177
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,270
It's chaos mode.

1178
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,000
And I know she's approached Tim,
'cause I saw it and I heard it.

1179
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,580
Let me know who to vote for,
and look at me.

1180
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,440
I will vote with you.

1181
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,890
You're not looking at me.
Tell me what I got to do.

1182
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,930
BEN:
I'm just hoping we take Jem out.

1183
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,170
The problem is,

1184
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,930
nobody knows
I don't have a vote.

1185
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,130
-Jem's in chaos mode.
-TIM: Yeah, I bet.

1186
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,000
I had to grab the hammer 'cause
she was holding the machete.

1187
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,030
And she goes,
"You know I'm loyal.

1188
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,370
Like, you know
we can work together."

1189
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,510
And she just
keeps interrupting me.

1190
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1191
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,270
BEN:
Me not having a vote,
it definitely blows.

1192
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,680
But, like, Jem-- she's kind of,

1193
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,890
like, made everybody
feel a little bit on edge.

1194
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,620
She's on endgame mode.

1195
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,930
But if you come into a game
like this already thinking

1196
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,890
about the million dollars
and you're not thinking about

1197
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,680
every step along the way,
you're never gonna get there.

1198
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,060
-Jem confronting
all of us like that...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1199
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,170
Now, potentially,
you don't have a vote?

1200
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,060
BEN:
Just assuming
I don't have it, right?

1201
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:20,930
If you, Tim and Charlie
stick on Jem,

1202
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,680
it's still a majority.

1203
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,060
CHARLIE:
Maria and I have been
playing the middle

1204
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,240
the entire time
we've been out here.

1205
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,200
I go back and forth.
I think Maria

1206
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,510
goes back and forth.

1207
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,550
And right now,
we're at that crossroads.

1208
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,960
Okay. Just tell me
where your head's at.

1209
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,750
-[sighs]
-[chuckles softly]

1210
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,960
We can go with the women--
Jem and Mo--

1211
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,440
or we could go with Tim and Ben
and with the men.

1212
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,000
This is the thing
that makes me nervous is,

1213
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,620
I heard you saying that
you're feeling close to Ben.

1214
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,000
Just, like, you feel
bonded to him, and...

1215
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,580
So I'll tell you
where my head's at with Ben.

1216
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,060
We need threats in front of us.

1217
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,340
-He's a shield.
-Yeah.

1218
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,680
And he is a charisma
rock and roll shield.

1219
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:57,270
MARIA:
Clearly, Charlie's more

1220
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,130
keen on working
with Ben and Tim,

1221
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,720
but, you know,
trust is a big deal for me.

1222
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,130
I think working with Jem and Mo,

1223
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,930
we have a much deeper amount
of trust. Like, I don't...

1224
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,200
I don't trust Ben and Tim.

1225
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,580
I have flip-flopped
like a kid on a seesaw,

1226
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,720
because I think that Jem

1227
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,680
will be loyal to us
down the line.

1228
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,410
We have to think long-term.

1229
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:17,620
CHARLIE:
Jem and Ben

1230
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,720
both have reasons
to catch votes tonight.

1231
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,650
Yeah. Yeah.

1232
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,000
-Okay. All right.
-Let's do this.

1233
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,820
Jem's playing really hard,
making people

1234
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,370
be very wary of her.

1235
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,060
So you don't hit me
with the machete.

1236
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:33,200
CHARLIE:
Ben's strength is his humor,

1237
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,170
but that's just as dangerous
as it is fun to be around.

1238
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,100
Tonight, we find out
the alliances.

1239
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,680
MORIAH:
Line in the sand.

1240
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,890
CHARLIE:
At Tribal, there's
no more flip-flopping.

1241
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,720
It's all about Maria and I

1242
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,100
putting our cards on the table
and not looking back.

1243
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,130
And all of a sudden,
you've got six people

1244
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,240
who yesterday were hunky-dory,
dancing the salsa,

1245
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,060
and today,

1246
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,340
we're scared out of our minds
that our dream's gonna end,

1247
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,000
you know, no more salsa.

1248
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
♪ ♪

1249
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,130
Behind each of you is a torch.

1250
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,240
Go ahead and grab one,
dip it in and get fire.

1251
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,930
This is part of the ritual
at Tribal Council

1252
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:44,480
because in this game,
fire represents your life.

1253
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,890
When your fire's gone,
so are you.

1254
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,550
That will be the case for
one of the six of you tonight.

1255
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,030
So, Ben, the upside
of not coming to Tribal

1256
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,270
until day 11 is obvious.

1257
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,440
All six people
are still in the game.

1258
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,750
So what do you do,
from an individual standpoint,

1259
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,310
when you all share
one thing in common:

1260
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:04,960
you've never been to Tribal?

1261
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,310
Definitely feels
like some Ozzy Osbourne

1262
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,370
-"going off the rails on a crazy
train" in every direction.
-[Moriah laughs]

1263
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,310
Everybody, I think,
is sussing out a vibe.

1264
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,060
We've been calling ourselves
"the vibe tribe"

1265
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:18,410
since day one,
and now the reckoning has come.

1266
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:22,270
Maria, how does it impact
the first Tribal

1267
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:25,370
when you've spent so many days
relying on each other,

1268
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,890
surviving in the jungle, and now
you got to vote somebody out?

1269
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,750
I think this is the time
where we rip off the Band-Aid.

1270
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,860
And this is gonna hurt,
doing it at day 11,

1271
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,820
I think, than having to do it
at day two or three,

1272
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,270
because we gel so well together.

1273
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,750
-We're even dancing together.
-Yeah.

1274
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,030
Yeah, we learned how to salsa
dance from Maria yesterday.

1275
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,030
It's like being
at a retreat sometimes.

1276
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,620
-Wake up, shred the aqua dump.
-[laughing]

1277
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,130
-Then everybody's, like...
-Yeah, normal retreat, yeah.

1278
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,310
-Just to clarify,
we do not aqua dump together.
-Yeah.

1279
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,310
MORIAH:
That's the one
solo activity we do.

1280
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,240
But it feels like

1281
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,510
we're living in
Survivorla-la land.

1282
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,440
JEM:
Jeff, it goes like this.

1283
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,960
"I'm low on water.
I want to go to the well."

1284
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,680
-"Okay, we're coming."
-Five hands.

1285
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,310
And all six of us walk
to the water well

1286
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:08,890
and to tree mail.

1287
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,510
We go to bed together,

1288
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,960
we wake up together.

1289
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,200
-PROBST: Well, Charlie?
-Yeah.

1290
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,200
What all of that equals

1291
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:17,750
to me is
massive blindside tonight.

1292
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,510
I'm no math guy,
but it seems like

1293
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,060
you've got the equation right.

1294
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:24,000
You know, we don't have
a Hunter or a Q.

1295
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,960
How we survive is by
being scrappy, by being gritty

1296
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,860
and working together.
That was

1297
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,370
necessary for us
to all get to day 11,

1298
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,100
but we're starting to feel
the heat for the first time.

1299
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,410
It's not just smoke. There's
a whole lot of fire around here.

1300
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,820
PROBST:
Moriah, was there
much talk about

1301
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,790
-idols or advantages
in the game?
-MORIAH: Oh, yeah.

1302
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,100
There's the possibility
of an idol out there,

1303
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,340
and I don't know
how many votes may be

1304
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,000
at this Tribal at this point.

1305
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,820
People may have zero votes.

1306
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,440
Some people may have two.

1307
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,720
There may be four extra votes
cast tonight.

1308
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,240
Actually,
I'm really bad at math,

1309
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,060
so that doesn't totally add up
to me right now.

1310
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,310
But I get your point, is that
there's this uncertainty

1311
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,550
-because of journeys
about who might have what.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1312
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,170
MORIAH:
Yeah. And then,

1313
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:09,680
we're a hot mess when it comes
to, like, Beware Advantages.

1314
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,680
We've had, like, a laundry list

1315
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,720
of debacles over at camp.

1316
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,370
CHARLIE:
Jeff, Maria found

1317
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,580
what we assumed
was a Beware Advantage.

1318
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,000
All the advantage says
is "dig down."

1319
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,790
So we get digging, and we get
digging, and we get digging.

1320
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:29,130
And then we rip the whole
tree up, and there's nothing.

1321
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,510
And all six Sigas have been
pouring a whole lot of energy

1322
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,440
into a whole lot of nothing.

1323
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,030
-Over three days,
-Emphasis on "hole."

1324
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,750
PROBST:
So, Maria, what's the conclusion

1325
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,170
that you've come to?

1326
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,270
-That you haven't found it?
-MARIA: Well,

1327
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,060
that's a really
good question, Jeff.

1328
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:46,650
I think that it must have

1329
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,790
been found
by someone else before me.

1330
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,550
Yeah.

1331
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,130
So, Jem, you're in
an interesting dilemma

1332
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,200
as a group of six because
you formed these relationships,

1333
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,580
people that you like
and want to work with.

1334
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,100
So was there any debate for you

1335
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,130
about who you wanted
to vote out tonight?

1336
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,890
I'm sitting here
and I am lost for words

1337
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,960
because I'm still
trying to think

1338
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,890
who I might want
to put on the parchment.

1339
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,340
And there's no name
that's coming up.

1340
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,340
Like, can I write
your name down?

1341
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,310
-[laughing]
-You can't write
my name down, Jem.

1342
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,860
I'm here forever.

1343
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,170
Sorry. Sorry.

1344
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:21,720
Permanent immunity idol.

1345
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,130
So, Tim,
what is about to happen?

1346
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,410
Because even right now,
everybody's smiling and yet

1347
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:28,720
a name will be written down,

1348
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,170
and I'm guessing
one of the six of you

1349
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,130
are going to be
very surprised it's you.

1350
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,410
-Am I right?
-You're absolutely right.

1351
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,270
But we might just
all be playing

1352
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,930
a very, very good game
right now

1353
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,680
so that nobody feels targeted

1354
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:45,030
before we all start
marching up those steps.

1355
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,310
Maria, that rings very true.

1356
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:50,340
It does.
I think that

1357
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,720
we all, deep down, know
what we're gonna write down.

1358
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,680
I think all of us are lying

1359
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:59,270
by saying we don't know
what we're gonna do.

1360
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,370
Jem, do you think
that's a group feeling

1361
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,370
or is that just
where Maria's at?

1362
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,860
I think nobody
wants to rock the boat.

1363
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,720
Just thinking about it,
there's so many options, right?

1364
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,860
If you want to move forward
in this game,

1365
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,310
you have to be able to,
like, trust the alliances

1366
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,890
you made right now.

1367
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,030
Ben, is it possible that
tonight's vote does more damage

1368
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,030
than just one person going home

1369
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,860
'cause you can no longer
trust everybody?

1370
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,030
BEN:
I mean, that's always
a possibility.

1371
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,790
I know I'm still getting
a Siga tattoo either way.

1372
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:30,310
You know?
We've all talked about it.

1373
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,060
But, um, yeah, obviously,

1374
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,960
you never know
if somebody's gonna feel like

1375
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,620
they were on the bottom,
and if we get to another side,

1376
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,480
why would I want to work
with those people in the merge?

1377
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,510
So you never know, but
that's the thing about Survivor.

1378
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,650
One vote,
one challenge at a time.

1379
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,200
Hopefully,
you get to your long goal.

PROBST:
Charlie, how will this tribe

1381
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,650
be different
after tonight's vote?

1382
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,200
CHARLIE:
I think it's a test of

1383
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:58,030
can this tribe face a loss
and still be the vibe tribe,

1384
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,580
or is the vibe tribe a mask
that we've been wearing

1385
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,130
and after tonight,

1386
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,440
it's been ripped off
and it's not coming back?

1387
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:06,890
MARIA:
But I think, Jeff,

1388
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,060
that at the end of the day,
we have to separate

1389
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,860
emotions and game.

1390
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,060
Easy to do?

1391
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,270
Very difficult to do.

1392
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,620
PROBST:
All right, it is

1393
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,000
time to vote.
Tim, you're up.

1395
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,510
I'm so scared and so nerding out
at the same time.

1396

BEN [whispering]:
No vote.

1397
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:48,340
We'll see how it goes.
All right.

are six players in the game."

1399
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,930
I'll go tally the votes.

1400
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,860
If anybody
has an advantage or an idol

1401
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,000
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

1402
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,410
Okay, I'll read the votes.

1403
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,000

Ben.

1405
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:01,820
Jem.
One vote Ben, one vote Jem.

1406
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,650
Ben.
That's two votes Ben.

1407
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:17,130
Jem. We're tied.
Two votes Ben, two votes Jem.

1408

two votes Ben.

Need to bring me your torch.

01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,720
Jem, the tribe has spoken.

1412
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,960
Time for you to go.

1413
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,440
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

1414
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:16,960

Baby, it's about to get messy.

The dumbest move.
With an idol in my pocket. Ugh.

1426
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,480
Honestly, I did not expect this.

1427
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,000
This was
a total blindside tonight.

1428
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,930
But it was really fun for me.

1429
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,510
I love that I replanted
a Beware Advantage

1430
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,480
and got them digging
for three days.

1431
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,790
So, I mean, it serves them
right, they voted me out.
