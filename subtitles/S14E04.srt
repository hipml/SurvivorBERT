00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,085
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,129
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:04,462
>> Come here.

4
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,088
Hurry, hurry.

5
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,965
>> This is going too great.

6
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:07,841
>> Yeah, it's, like, too good to

7
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:08,758
be true, man.

8
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,592
>> PROBST: Moto continued to

9
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,635
grow stronger.

10
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,261
>> It's not even survival, it's

11
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,723
thrival.

12
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:15,890
>> PROBST: While Ravu became

13
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,226
weaker and weaker.

14
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,770
Until the sun came out-- then

15
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,480
Ravu transformed its rays into

16
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,441
fire.

17
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,109
>> Awesome!

18
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,028
>> We're not going to die!

19
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,572
>> PROBST: At the reward

20
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,449
challenge, Gary took a hard

21
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,242
fall, but Moto still came out

22
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,160
ahead.

23
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,871
>> Dre scores for Moto!

24
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,455
>> PROBST: Giving Moto more

25
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,457
fishing gear and widening the

26
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,083
gap between the two tribes.

27
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,293
>> Sylvia.

28
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,252
>> PROBST: Sylvia was sent to

29
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,920
Exile Island where she received

30
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,213
a pivotal clue to the

31
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,381
whereabouts of the idol hidden

32
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,090
back at camp.

33
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,384
>> "You'll find it under the

34
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,469
cave's threshold if you dig

35
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,928
deep."

36
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:54,554
I need to figure out a time and

37
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,097
a place to look for the idol as

38
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,223
quickly as possible.

39
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,099
>> PROBST: At Moto...

40
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,267
>> He can't breathe.

41
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,227
>> PROBST: ...Gary was beginning

42
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,145
to feel ill.

43
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:02,729
>> We're going to keep a close

44
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,022
eye on him.

45
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:04,898
His health is more important

46
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,065
than the game to us.

47
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,649
>> PROBST: But at the immunity

48
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,317
challenge...

49
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,778
Papa Smurf starting on his

50
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,153
second snout.

51
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,405
Gary pulled through when Anthony

52
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,908
was unable to chew a pig snout.

53
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,286
Moto wins immunity again!

54
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,205
Before tribal council...

55
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,081
>> Does he irk you at all, or

56
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,124
no?

57
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,417
He seems a little on the whiny

58
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,335
side.

59
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,419
>> PROBST: ...Anthony and Sylvia

60
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,295
were both on the hot seat, and

61
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,798
Sylvia's only hope was finding

62
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,424
the hidden immunity idol.

63
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,342
>> If I get the idol and if the

64
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,177
vote does go my way, I will be

65
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,137
able to surprise everybody.

66
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,640
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

67
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,016
Anthony questioned his position

68
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,226
in the tribe.

69
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,143
>> I often wonder if these folks

70
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,228
even like me.

71
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,187
I like to think they like me,

72
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,146
but, you know, sometimes you

73
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,189
can't tell.

74
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,357
>> PROBST: Mookie, what's your

75
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,275
thought on what Anthony said?

76
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,902
>> After the challenge, I was

77
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,362
really pissed off.

78
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,655
When you take a little piece of

79
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,740
snout this small, you can will

80
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,324
yourself to throw it down.

81
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,243
>> PROBST: But when Sylvia

82
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,494
failed to produce the idol, she

83
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,120
was voted out of the game.

84
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,373
Sylvia, the tribe has spoken.

85
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,500
16 are left.

86
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:19,305
Who will be voted out tonight?

87
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,307
>> We going to start a fire or

88
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,475
what?

89
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,560
>> Yeah.

90
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,352
>> Let's just get the fire

91
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:24,561
going.

92
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,186
We will talk about whatever

93
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,187
needs to be talked about, get it

94
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,106
all out.

95
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,065
Just all this silly stuff just

96
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,483
has to go.

97
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,068
When we came back to camp, I

98
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,862
wanted us all to have a powwow.

99
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,573
I mean, people have problems

100
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,907
with certain people, personality

101
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,950
problems, and they don't say

102
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,076
anything.

103
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,618
So that other person doesn't

104
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,120
know.

105
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,121
So this just keeps on going and

106
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:43,705
pressure builds up and then

107
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,582
people explode.

108
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,749
We'll start talking.

109
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,625
>> All of us start talking?

110
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,418
>> Start talking, man.

111
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:48,835
>> Start talking.

112
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,169
What would you like to talk

113
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:50,920
about?

114
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,671
>> Start talking.

115
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,422
>> I don't want to be involved

116
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,006
in bitching and moaning and

117
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,173
screaming.

118
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:54,966
>> Certain people want to bitch

119
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:55,758
and moan, though.

120
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,551
>> But guy, that's all he (<i> no</i>

121
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,302
<i>audio</i> ) does.

122
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:57,927
>> Reacting like that, that's

123
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,012
just...

124
00:02:59,095 --> 00:02:59,846
>> Reacting like what?

125
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,638
>> Just chill, for real.

126
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,639
>> You have no idea how much I'm

127
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,099
holding back, especially with

128
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:03,683
Anthony, you know what I mean?

129
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,518
Sitting around dealing with

130
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,561
somebody you really can't tell

131
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,478
him how you feel because you're

132
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,438
worried about his vote.

133
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,355
Right now I could care less

134
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,398
about his vote.

135
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,399
For some reason, Anthony, you

136
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,692
consistently irritate the (<i> no</i>

137
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,694
<i>audio</i> ) out of me all the (<i> no</i>

138
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,778
<i>audio</i> ) time.

139
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,779
And I think you go out of your

140
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,989
way to do it.

141
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:18,990
I think you go out of your way

142
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:19,949
to do it.

143
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,533
I think, for some reason, for

144
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,368
some strange reason, you play

145
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,286
the sympathy case once in a

146
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,788
while that drives me nuts.

147
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,248
I don't usually deal with people

148
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,458
like that unless it's a broad--

149
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,168
no offense to ladies, that's how

150
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,586
I talk to girls-- unless it's a

151
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,795
girl or it's my mother or it's

152
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,380
my crazy aunt.

153
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,256
Everybody messes up, but when

154
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,675
you whine about something or you

155
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,968
get all, like... you get all,

156
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,428
like, sentimental and

157
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,262
sensitive... you're a man.

158
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,306
At least, the way I was raised,

159
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,265
I'm a man, I've got to act like

160
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,308
one.

161
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,309
>> I'm sorry I irk you, and I'm

162
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:46,768
sorry I irritate you.

163
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,393
I have no idea what I'm doing to

164
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,437
you that's irritating you.

165
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,314
I've spent a lot of my life with

166
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,107
very little self-esteem.

167
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:53,691
You know, I got picked on as a

168
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,027
kid, and I guess I developed a

169
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,029
whole lot of self-loathing.

170
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,781
>> I got along with Jessica.

171
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,407
I got along with Erica.

172
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,742
Those two people are gone, and

173
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,952
you're still here driving me

174
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,328
absolutely insane.

175
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,537
Both of those girls, better

176
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,872
players than you.

177
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,831
No offense.

178
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,791
Some people have it, some people

179
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,750
don't.

180
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,834
>> I may not be doing the best

181
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,544
in the challenges, but if they

182
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,296
want me off this island, they

183
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,548
want me out of this game,

184
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,508
they're going to have to push me

185
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,342
off.

186
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:19,968
Because there's no way in hell

187
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,512
I'm giving up.

188
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,554
>> Wow, I'm in Fiji.

189
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,473
This is gorgeous.

190
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,058
It's absolutely breathtaking.

191
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,975
And at night with the moon is

192
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,311
out...

193
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,274
>> Which makes our thing so

194
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,484
perfect, you know?

195
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,568
>> Right.

196
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,652
Yeah.

197
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,571
The five musketeers.

198
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,823
>> From the beginning there has

199
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,243
been a bond between Boo, Alex,

200
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,205
Edgar, myself, and Stacy.

201
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:12,747
It's almost been unspoken.

202
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,957
All we know is that the five of

203
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,375
us get along and we're not

204
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:16,959
stepping on each other's toes.

205
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,754
We all kind of come together.

206
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,422
It's just amazing how things

207
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,590
have just, like, fallen into

208
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,841
place.

209
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,842
>> The other team must be

210
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,010
kicking their asses right now.

211
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,512
>> That's the way the cookie

212
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,805
crumbles.

213
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,889
>> This water is awesome!

214
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,973
I just want that cloud to go

215
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,351
away.

216
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,825
>> So Gary...

217
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,709
>> Mm-hmm.

218
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,922
>> I've done a lot of miserable

219
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,215
things in my life.

220
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,216
I mean, I did a tour of Vietnam

221
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:05,842
and we had some crap that wasn't

222
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,677
no fun either.

223
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,137
But gee whiz, this is just...

224
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,930
the head spinning is just... I

225
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,015
can't... you can't function.

226
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,529
>> Everybody loves Gary in the

227
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,572
tribe, and definitely want him

228
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,698
to keep competing if he feels

229
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,824
good enough, but I think he

230
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,242
should take his health first.

231
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,286
At his age, the amount of stress

232
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,537
and possibly high blood

233
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,539
pressure... I want him to feel

234
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,958
better, first of all.

235
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,501
>> You have so many bites, Gary.

236
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,587
>> Mm-hmm.

237
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,213
You've got thousands of them.

238
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,674
Gary does not look good at all,

239
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,259
and eventually it's going to

240
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,385
turn into, like, a babysitting

241
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:49,677
situation.

242
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,264
It's like, "Okay, you know, did

243
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,348
I just have a baby and didn't

244
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:54,640
realize it?"

245
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,600
Did you have some of that

246
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,560
coconut meat?

247
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:57,810
>> Mm-hmm.

248
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,644
>> You should have some, have

249
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,605
plenty.

250
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,647
I really don't want to take care

251
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,857
of him.

252
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,275
I don't want to babysit.

253
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,651
So let's hope he gets better.

254
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,570
That's the only thing I can say.

255
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,572
If he doesn't get better he's

256
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,949
going have to go.

257
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,335
>> PROBST: Moto, come on in!

258
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,552
Ravu, come on in!

259
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,929
Moto getting your first look at

260
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:33,721
the new Ravu tribe.

261
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,765
Sylvia voted out at the last

262
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,350
tribal council.

263
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,144
>> Whoa.

264
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,979
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

265
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,272
to today's challenge?

266
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,315
>> Yep.

267
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,441
>> Yeah, we are.

268
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:45,900
>> PROBST: For today's

269
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,861
challenge, both tribes will line

270
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,947
up side by side on a very narrow

271
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,657
balance beam over water.

272
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,200
Moving one tribe member at a

273
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,993
time, you must make your way

274
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,246
across the beam, stepping around

275
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,373
your tribemates as you go.

276
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,749
If you fall off, or if you are

277
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,543
knocked off, you go back to the

278
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,461
start.

279
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,797
Once you get off the beam, onto

280
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,382
the finish platform, then the

281
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,716
next tribe member goes.

282
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,927
You can change your crossing

283
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,470
order mid challenge, but you

284
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:15,763
have to jump in the water to

285
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,931
do so.

286
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,683
First tribe to get all their

287
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,600
tribemates offof the beam,

288
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,810
on to the finish platform, win

289
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,811
reward.

290
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,687
Want to know what you're playing

291
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,563
for?

292
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:24,814
>> Yeah.

293
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,358
>> PROBST: It's another big one.

294
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,402
>> Oh, man!

295
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,572
>> PROBST: Whole lot of fish.

296
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,865
>> Fish, yeah.

297
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:35,658
>> PROBST: Plenty of rice.

298
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,703
Spices to liven up everything

299
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,079
you eat.

300
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,580
Plus some comfort-- pillows,

301
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,707
blankets.

302
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,874
That's not all.

303
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,293
Waiting back at camp for the

304
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,961
winning tribe, a king-sized bed

305
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,131
with sheets and pillows.

306
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,342
In addition, the winning tribe

307
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,927
will send one member from the

308
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,137
losing tribe to Exile Island.

309
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,471
Moto, you have two extra

310
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,472
members.

311
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,974
Who are you going to sit out?

312
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:00,850
>> Cassandra and Papa Smurf.

313
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,643
>> PROBST: Gary and Cassandra,

314
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,644
sitting this one out.

315
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:03,894
Swim out.

316
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,981
We'll get started.

317
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,652
Once you guys are set, you

318
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,778
cannot be holding onto each

319
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,863
other.

320
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,865
The only person you can touch is

321
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,866
the person that's crossing you.

322
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,743
The wind is starting to pick up.

323
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,037
Perfect time to begin this

324
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,038
challenge.

325
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:22,788
Survivors ready?

326
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,499
Go.

327
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,168
Michelle for Ravu makes her way

328
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,545
around Yau-Man.

329
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:34,008
Stacy working around Lisi.

330
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,426
>> Oh!

331
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,719
>> PROBST: Both going in.

332
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,347
Michelle working Rita now.

333
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,890
Stacy and Lisi are trying to get

334
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,849
back up.

335
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,561
Big reward on the line.

336
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,814
Stacy tries a new approach.

337
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,815
And that knocks Lisi off.

338
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,984
There's a learning curve to this

339
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,943
challenge.

340
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,028
You will figure it out as you go

341
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,821
along.

342
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,448
Michelle making good progress.

343
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,492
She's halfway through.

344
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,703
Dreamz has a new idea.

345
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,372
Your hands cannot touch the

346
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,332
beam.

347
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,210
Lisi steps over Stacy.

348
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:09,919
Michelle hugging her way past

349
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,588
Rocky.

350
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,131
Lisi stepping over Alex.

351
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,509
Both going in.

352
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,135
Michelle easily sidesteps around

353
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,845
Earl, the first tribe member

354
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,597
across for Ravu.

355
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,224
>> Lisi, let's go, baby, both of

356
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,726
your hands on Alex.

357
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,019
>> PROBST: Moto going to stick

358
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,770
with their strategy.

359
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,814
Yau-Man now working around Rita.

360
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,401
Gingerly, but it's effective.

361
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,027
Lisi now going to have to

362
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:35,736
sidestep a much taller guy, and

363
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,863
she can't do it.

364
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,282
Lisi back to the start.

365
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,790
Yau-Man crosses for Ravu.

366
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,960
Ravu leads 2-0.

367
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,920
Moto has a very precise strategy

368
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,422
they're trying to work out.

369
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,005
No, Lisi, you can't touch two

370
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,550
people.

371
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,969
One at a time, one at a time.

372
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,847
Rita now working for Ravu.

373
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,015
>> You can do it!

374
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,143
You can do it!

375
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,602
>> PROBST: Lisi still trying to

376
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,770
be the first member across for

377

Moto.

weight on him but make sure it's

382
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,951
balanced.

383
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,203
>> PROBST: Lisi, one member left

384
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,997
to get over.

385
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,874
Lisi across for Moto.

386
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,043
It's two-one.

387
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,003
Anthony and Rita have been

388
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,046
locked in an embrace for a long

389
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,090
time.

390
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,258
Anthony falls off, a lot of

391
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,052
progress lost for Ravu.

392
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,679
Moto's strategy is starting to

393
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,515
work.

394
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,975
Alex over Boo.

395
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,685
Moto has tied at two-two.

396
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,102
>> Come on, come on!

397
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:50,853
>> PROBST: Mookie and Anthony,

398
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,731
going to have to work together.

399
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,364
Mookie and Anthony both fall in.

400
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,741
Stacy trying to figure out how

401
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,118
she's going to get over Edgardo.

402
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,955
Edgardo jumps in.

403
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,873
All kinds of strategy coming

404
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,999
into play.

405
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,959
>> Everyone fall in.

406
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,920
Everyone fall in!

407
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:16,837
Earl, stay.

408
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,213
Come on, come on!

409
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,756
>> PROBST: Ravu changing their

410
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,089
entire lineup.

411
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,008
Half the tribe jumps in to give

412
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,510
the stronger people a better

413
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,802
shot.

414
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,762
But Anthony can't even stay up

415
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,054
on the beam.

416
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,057
>> (<i> groaning</i> )

417
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,560
>> (<i> cheers</i> )

418
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,229
>> PROBST: Edgardo scores for

419
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,063
Moto.

420
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:34,980
We are three-two, Moto now in

421
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:35,940
the lead.

422
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,858
Ravu now using Moto's strategy.

423
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,444
Mookie, you can only touch one

424
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,403
at a time.

425
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:41,904
Think.

426
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,908
Get in the water.

427
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,078
Liliana making it look easy.

428
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,996
Moto leads four-two.

429
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,166
Ravu still working.

430
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,001
Dreamz is across.

431
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:02,049
It is five-two.

432
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,719
Stacy across for Moto.

433
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,514
Boo gives a wave to the crowd.

434
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,974
Moto wins reward!

435
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,942
Ravu, once again, early lead,

436
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,485
lost it in the end.

437
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,027
Moto, still undefeated in

438
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,822
challenges, and a big decision

439
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,198
to make.

440
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,408
Sending one person to Exile

441
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,701
Island.

442
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,326
They will return in time for the

443
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,161
next immunity challenge.

444
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,038
Who's it going to be?

445
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,456
>> Yau-Man.

446
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,791
>> PROBST: Yau-Man going to

447
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,333
Exile Island, where you will

448
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,001
find another clue to the

449
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,919
whereabouts of the hidden

450
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,714
immunity idol.

451
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:48,846
Moto-- fish, rice, spices, and

452
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,471
waiting back at camp, a king-

453
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,806
sized bed.

454
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,807
Congratulations.

455
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,433
Ravu, once again, got nothing

456
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,059
for you.

457
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,520
Head back to camp.

458
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,171
>> Yeah!

459
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,006
>> This is great!

460
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,009
>> Look at the size of this

461
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,054
fish!

462
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,723
>> Today we once again kicked

463
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,475
the crap out of Ravu, and in the

464
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,976
process, won ourselves a bed,

465
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,356
which I am so excited about.

466
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:40,981
>> Oh, my god.

467
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,024
>> We can fit five people in

468
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,108
here, man.

469
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,069
>> Not only to we have comfort

470
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,070
with the cushions and the

471
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,989
blankets, but the fish that we

472
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,074
got, and the seasoning, I was

473
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,116
like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm in

474
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,159
heaven."

475
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,161
>> Here, pull these spices off.

476
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,954
>> Man, soy sauce!

477
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,997
>> Paprika.

478
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,040
>> I know.

479
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:58,540
>> Okay, what you all got?

480
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:58,999
>> Oregano.

481
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,876
>> We're just living lovely

482
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,627
right now.

483
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,628
Our morale is up now more than

484
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,837
ever.

485
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,838
>> Geez, man, we're going to eat

486
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,214
like kings today.

487
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,924
>> Oh, man!

488
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,759
>> Motolicious.

489
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,595
>> I feel sorry for the

490
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,846
individual members of the other

491
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,972
tribe, but I want us to continue

492
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,223
winning.

493
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,182
I... I don't want to let up for

494
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,560
a second.

495
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,199
>> Absolutely ridiculous!

496
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,451
Five in a row?

497
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,745
Five in a row we lose?

498
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,871
>> What do you want to do?

499
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,914
Do you want to get together and

500
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,666
talk about it, or...

501
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,125
>> Thank you!

502
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,919
Why don't we just go to tribal

503
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,754
council right now?

504
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,714
You want to go to tribal council

505
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,631
right now, we'll vote somebody

506
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,632
off?

507
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,508
Because that's all we do every

508
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,426
week.

509
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,552
Every other day we vote somebody

510
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,720
off.

511
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,012
So why don't we call Jeff up

512
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,222
right now on the Jeff phone and

513
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,390
go, "Hey, Jeff, we're ready to

514
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,268
vote somebody off today."

515
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,644
I'm skinnier than homeless

516
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,937
people right now.

517
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,313
I know 15 homeless people that

518
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,982
are 40 pounds heavier than me.

519
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,024
Are you serious?

520
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,608
They're getting more nutrition

521
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,110
in their diet.

522
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,319
That's it right there.

523
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,362
That was it.

524
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,865
Food, pillows, a bed.

525
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,949
Everything we complain about

526
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:14,908
every day and we couldn't muster

527
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,618
it up.

528
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,161
Tell me why.

529
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,080
>> We just lost.

530
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,248
>> So what's the sense?

531
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,207
What's the sense of going, "Oh,

532
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,125
we'll get them next time, oh,

533
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,168
we'll do this next time"?

534
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,085
No.

535
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,128
I'm not sugarcoating nothing.

536
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,129
>> We lost, it sucks, let's move

537
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,088
on.

538
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,007
I mean, if you go in somewhere

539
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,883
thinking you're going to lose,

540
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,884
your chances are...

541
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,718
>> I'm not being negative.

542
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,635
I'm stating the obvious.

543
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,595
There's a difference.

544
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,512
There's a difference.

545
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,598
>> Who's going to get more wood?

546
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,017
>> I like Rocky's spirit but

547
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,642
it's not all about just talk.

548
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,144
It's about motivating.

549
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,228
Like, do something-- not just at

550
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,396
challenges but here on this

551
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,023
island.

552
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,399
>> Argh!

553
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,235
>> I'm starving!

554
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,617
>> We have an interesting tribe.

555
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,201
>> I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm

556
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,495
thirsty, but do I still get my

557
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,497
ass up and go do something?

558
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,706
Yeah.

559
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,957
But I'm telling you now, I can

560
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,250
already feel this one.

561
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,210
>> I already know how it's going

562
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,169
to go.

563
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,212
If we lose tomorrow, you know

564
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,171
whose name's going down?

565
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,464
It's going to be me.

566
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,465
I know I have a big target on

567
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,592
me, and I know that I have to be

568
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,177
careful and patient.

569
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,512
But now that I've gotten a

570
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,930
better grasp on who James is,

571
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,681
I'll let him keep talking,

572
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,266
because really in the end it

573
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,101
makes him look like an ass.

574
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,186
If you don't like your bed, fix

575
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,854
it.

576
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,774
Chop down some palm fronds.

577
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,149
I trust Anthony.

578
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,318
I think he's a good guy, he's a

579
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,569
genuine guy.

580
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,238
But it's getting harder to look

581
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,781
out for him.

582
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,406
But I haven't made my exact move

583
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,325
yet of what I'm going to do.

584
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,744
I'm still devising the plan.

585
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,215
>> "Here you won't find the idol

586
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,299
you crave.

587
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,051
It's buried under the highest

588
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,261
point of the big cave."

589
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:02,349
I'm not resentful at all of Moto

590
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,976
for sending me here.

591
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,185
In a way, I'm glad I get a

592
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,562
chance to find the immunity

593
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,271
idol.

594
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,397
Highest point through which you

595
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,356
enter.

596
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,275
So it must be at the entrance.

597
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,151
We may be sleeping on it.

598
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:13,777
I'm quite sure I know where the

599
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,319
idol is.

600
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,405
The problem, of course, is when

601
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,532
do I get the chance to dig

602
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,825
alone?

603
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,951
I need the immunity idol very

604
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:21,577
badly, so I'll see how fast I

605
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,413
can dig.

606
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,316
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa!

607
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,317
(<i> laughter</i> )

608
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,235
>> Liliana knows what she's

609
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,905
doing, and sometimes guys aren't

610
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,740
hip to the way chicks maneuver.

611
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,575
It's funny, because Liliana

612
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,951
tries to be so sneaky, but I'm

613
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,620
Latin, and knowing my people the

614
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,038
way that I do, I see what she's

615
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,289
doing.

616
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,999
I know in her little diabolical

617
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,542
Mexican mind she's trying to

618
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,543
come up with something, you

619
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,336
know?

620
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,297
>> Oh, my god!

621
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,299
(<i> laughter</i> )

622
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,592
>> Wow!

623
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,719
What in the world?

624
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,363
>> It just seems like the whole

625
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,280
world is caving in here.

626
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,115
I don't got the energy to do

627
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:42,991
nothing.

628
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,034
I just can't... I can't

629
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,703
function.

630
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,288
>> How you doing, big guy?

631
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,332
Feeling nauseated?

632
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,416
>> I ain't never had nothing

633
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,584
like this before.

634
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,086
I've had malaria ages ago, and

635
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,088
that's nothing compared to

636
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:56,463
what's going on.

637
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,464
It just kind of scares you a

638
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,550
little bit, you know?

639
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:07,474
I just don't have...

640
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,685
>> Hi, Gary.

641
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,702
>> I'm very worried for Papa

642
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,744
Smurf, because I can see Papa

643
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,954
Smurf was real hurt.

644
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,205
Papa Smurf is one of the only

645
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,248
people I talk to, so that's kind

646
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,499
of worrying me.

647
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,530
>> All right.

648
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,032
>> I'm not so concerned about

649
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,199
whether Gary stays in the game

650
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:06,408
or not.

651
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,744
Quite frankly, one less person,

652
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,038
you know, means greater odds for

653
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,290
all of us.

654
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,674
>> Good-bye, Papa Smurf.

655
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,550
>> Bye, Gary!

656
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,885
>> Bye, Gary!

657
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,094
>> Today was very frustrating,

658
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:26,553
to be honest with you.

659
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,139
We lost Gary, and... I don't

660
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,390
know.

661
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,850
I feel... I don't feel good

662
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,934
about it.

663
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,894
I don't feel good about today at

664
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,895
all.

665
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,854
>> Bye, Papa Smurf!

666
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,147
>> Bye, Papa Smurf!

667
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,273
>> Love you!

668
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:38,899
>> I hope to god we don't lose

669
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,442
the next immunity challenge

670
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,485
tomorrow.

671
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,486
But if we lose that immunity

672
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,945
challenge, we're 7-7.

673
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,322
In the eyes of the game, we're

674
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,616
tied, and then we're screwed.

675
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,510
>> I'm going crazy, bro.

676
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,512
I'm going crazy, bro.

677
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,222
I just want to start winning.

678
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,389
But all I can do is the best I

679
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,349
can and try to get people fired

680
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:12,599
up.

681
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,643
I can lead by example.

682
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,647
>> We've got tree mail!

683
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,440
>> Are you guys ready?

684
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,733
>> "Some of you are feeling

685
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,901
trapped while others just hang

686
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,319
around.

687
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,238
The key to winning today's event

688
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,281
on your teammates will be found.

689
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,950
Whether you're on the bottom or

690
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,035
if you're on the top, or if

691
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,912
you're..." don't, I don't want

692
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,413
to look at you.

693
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:35,705
>> Oh, dude.

694
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,708
>> "...the pressure today will

695
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,001
be intense.

696
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,169
Tonight for one this game will

697
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:41,628
stop."

698
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,671
>> I wasn't even watching.

699
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,298
>> Well, thankfully, I only got

700
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,634
like a half a second peek of

701
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,593
James naked.

702
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,887
Not a pretty sight.

703
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,305
>> Wear one of the girls'

704
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:52,514
shirts.

705
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,393
>> Do you want my bikini top?

706
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,018
>> I'm trying to make everybody

707
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,645
laugh.

708
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,063
I'm wearing a pink halter top

709
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,439
with some coconuts in it.

710
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,023
Feeling pretty good right now.

711
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,025
>> That's hilarious, man.

712
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,360
>> Anything to get the focus off

713
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,403
losing five in a row, and

714
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,487
hopefully just go out there and

715
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,157
let it loose and win a game.

716
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,834
>> PROBST: Ravu, come on in!

717
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,002
Rocky, Pink is a good color for

718
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,295
you.

719
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,379
>> Thanks, Jeff.

720
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,714
I was hoping you'd enjoy it.

721
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,382
>> PROBST: Ravu has a great

722
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,425
attitude for having not won

723
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,885
anything.

724
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,261
No, that was a complement.

725
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,387
>> Cool.

726
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,388
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

727
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:33,930
Yau-Man returning from Exile

728
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,808
Island.

729
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,726
>> Whoo!

730
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,852
>> I survived!

731
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,769
Thank you.

732
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:40,604
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

733
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,064
Moto.

734
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,822
>> PROBST: Gary, Papa Smurf, was

735
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,741
evacuated yesterday for medical

736
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,743
reasons from Moto's beach.

737
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,869
>> Oh, wow!

738
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:56,703
>> PROBST: The update is Gary is

739
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,872
officially out of the game, so

740
00:24:58,955 --> 00:24:59,998
Moto has lost their first

741
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,124
member.

742
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,209
>> Oh, no!

743
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,168
>> PROBST: They are now down to

744
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,169
eight.

745
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,212
Despite losing Gary, the game

746
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:05,754
continues.

747
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,257
I will take back immunity, Alex.

748
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,723
Immunity is back up for grabs.

749
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,974
Ready to get to today's immunity

750
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,100
challenge?

751
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,101
>> Do it.

752
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,436
>> Yeah!

753
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,313
>> PROBST: Four tribe members

754
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:23,939
will begin locked in floating

755
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,107
cages.

756
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,692
On my "go," another tribe member

757
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,194
will head out with the key to

758
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:29,778
unlock the first tribe member

759
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,822
from a cage.

760
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,698
Once that person is free, they

761
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,618
must then race across a series

762
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,161
of lily pads to free the second

763
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:38,787
member from a locked cage.

764
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,957
Once the fourth tribe member is

765
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,500
free from their cage, that tribe

766
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,043
member and the rescuer get onto

767
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,586
a boat where another tribe

768
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,129
member is waiting with a ring of

769
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,423
keys.

770
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,675
Together, you will paddle to

771
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,427
shore, picking up your stranded

772
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,929
tribemates as you go.

773
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,180
Once you're back to shore, you

774
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,432
must then form a human pyramid.

775
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,809
The person on top will use the

776
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,811
ring of keys to unlock that last

777
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,313
cage and free your final tribe

778
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,731
member.

779
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,566
First tribe to get on their

780
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,693
finish mat wins immunity.

781
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,652
Make sense?

782
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,820
>> Yep.

783
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,946
>> PROBST: There is one twist to

784
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,155
today's challenge.

785
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,658
Sealed inside this bottle is a

786
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,660
note.

787
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,787
The winning tribe will read this

788
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,621
note after the challenge.

789
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,665
Moto, you're going to have to

790
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,082
sit one person out.

791
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:24,749
Cannot sit out the same people

792
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,750
in back-to-back challenges.

793
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,877
Cassandra sat out last time.

794
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,462
Who's it going to be this time?

795
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,088
>> We're going to sit out Lisi.

796
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:30,714
>> PROBST: Lisi, have a spot on

797
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,465
the bench.

798
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,383
Everybody else, I'll give you a

799
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,259
minute to strategize and we'll

800
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,678
get started.

801
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,226
Here we go, for immunity.

802
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,769
Survivors ready?

803
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,857
Go!

804
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,817
Edgardo with the early lead for

805
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,110
Moto.

806
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,320
>> Come on, Edgardo!

807
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,487
>> Come on, Rocky.

808
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,197
Go, Rocky.

809
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:56,865
>> Edgardo to the cage first.

810
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,284
>> There you go, there you go.

811
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,410
Rocky loses his keys, falling

812
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,703
behind.

813
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,122
Dreamz is out.

814
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,750
He's on the lily pads.

815
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,918
Dreamz crawling across the lily

816
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,420
pads.

817
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,339
Rocky has Yau-Man out.

818
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,007
>> Come on, Yau.

819
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,383
Come on.

820
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,468
>> PROBST: Yau-Man takes on the

821
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,469
lily pads.

822
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,011
Dreamz working on the lock

823
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,055
trying to get Alex free.

824
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,892
Alex moving on for Moto.

825
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,352
>> Come on, Yau.

826
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,603
Come on, take your time.

827
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,355
>> PROBST: Yau-Man falling

828
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,731
behind for Ravu.

829
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,982
Yau-Man to the platform.

830
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,275
He's got to get up.

831
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,777
>> Good boy, Yau!

832
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,778
Push!

833
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,779
>> PROBST: Moto now one full

834
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:36,738
platform ahead.

835
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,739
>> You got it, baby.

836
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,990
You got it.

837
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,116
>> PROBST: Yau-Man losing his

838
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,284
had glasses trying to work on

839
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,535
the lot for Rita.

840
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,204
>> Come on.

841
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,123

She's working on the lily pads.

844
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,005
Barely hanging on.

845
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,050
Moto with a big lead now.

846
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,468
>> All right, all right, all

847
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,636
right.

848
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,429
>> Rita, push it, push it!

849
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,722
>> PROBST: Boo has Liliana free.

850
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,932
They're getting on the boat.

851
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,600
>> Go forward, forward, forward.

852
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,518
forward.

853
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,102
>> All right, guys paddle it!

854
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:07,894
Paddle it!

855
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,771
>> Dig, dig, dig.

856
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,980
There you go.

857
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,357
>> PROBST: Rita losing a lot of

858
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,566
time for Ravu.

859
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,818
>> Get in!

860
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,986

861
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,780

862
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,990
>> Rita just now at the

863
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,118
platform.

864
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:23,910
Ravu has a lot of time to make

865
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,829
up.

866
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,080
>> Row, row, row, row!

867
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,082
Ravu not quitting.

868
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:29,916
>> Dig, dig, dig!

869
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,502
>> PROBST: Mookie making up a

870
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,587
lot of time.

>> Jump in, jump in, jump in!

872
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,799
Dreamz now getting on the boat.

873
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,758
>> All right, here.

874
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,801
Come on.

875
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,928
>> Earl now free.

876
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,304
Ravu now in their boat.

877
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,515
>> Get on!

878
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,516
Get in the middle!

879
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,350
Get in the boat.

880
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,476
>> (<i> laughing</i> )

881
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,103
>> Come on, Rita!

882
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,062
>> Dig!

883
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:51,938
Left side, dig.

884
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,398
>> Dig, dig, dig, dig!

885
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:53,982
>> PROBST: Ravu, keep moving.

886
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,817
Let's go!

887
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,153
Moto heading into shore.

888
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,404
>> Yeah!

889
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,406
Yeah!

890
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,991
>> Come on, Rocky!

891
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,534
>> PROBST: You're still in it,

892
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,577
Ravu.

893
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,703
Let's go!

894
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,787
>> PROBST: Moto starts to work

895
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,830
on their human pyramid.

896
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,789
That top person has got to

897
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,958
stand.

898
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,418
Ravu now back.

899
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,796
Stacy working on the last lock.

900
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,965
There are five keys.

901
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,718
Stacy having trouble with the

902
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,428
lock, trying key after key,

903
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,013
hoping one will fit.

904
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,558
Ravu working on their pyramid.

905
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,726
Ravu back in it, if Michelle

906
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,520
picks the right key.

907
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,855
Immunity plus a twist to be

908
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,316
revealed on the line.

909
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:40,278
Stacy has to get down and open

910
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,946
the cage.

911
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,080
Moto wins immunity!

912
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,625
Still undefeated!

913
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,669
Moto, congratulations once

914
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,421
again.

915
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,632
>> Good job, guys!

916
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,257
>> PROBST: Now there's one more

917
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,051
element to this challenge-- the

918
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,219
bottle.

919
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,803
As I said, the winning tribe

920
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,804
would open the bottle and read

921
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,639
the note.

922
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,016
Who wants it?

923
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,482
>> "You have just won immunity.

924
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,026
You must now decide which is

925
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,486
more important to you, immunity

926
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,029
or comfort.

927
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,573
To keep your immunity, you must

928
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,992
live at the Ravu tribe camp.

929
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,619
>> Of course.

930
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,245
>> To enjoy the food and comfort

931
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,580
of the Moto camp, you must give

932
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,791
up immunity and vote someone out

933
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,793
tonight."

934
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,835
>> PROBST: So, interesting

935
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,711
dilemma-- which is more

936
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,671
important?

937
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,255
You can keep your tribe strong

938
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,632
at eight, switch camps, go live

939
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,592
on Ravu's beach.

940
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,176
If comfort is more important,

941
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,886
you can stay living where you

942
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,929
are.

943
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:48,930
You give immunity to Ravu, you

944
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,390
go to tribal council and vote

945
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,766
somebody out, and suddenly we

946
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,184
are even, 7-7.

947
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:53,977
So all of a sudden, Gary's

948
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,104
departure looming very large for

949
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,064
this tribe.

950
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,983
I'll give you a minute to talk

951
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,902
it over.

952
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:03,987
>> Who wants to keep the camp?

953
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,905
Raise your hand.

954
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,198
We're going to tribal council

955
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,658
tonight.

956
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,617
>> Jeff, we're keeping our

957
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,535
comfort and going to tribal

958
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,703
council.

959
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,620
>> PROBST: All right, Boo, go

960
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,457
ahead and give immunity to Ravu.

961
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,544
Ravu, for once, you won't be

962
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,962
going to tribal council.

963
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,380
Moto, you'll be going back to

964
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,798
your camp with all the comforts.

965
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,091
I'll see you at tribal.

966
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,342
Grab your stuff, head on back to

967
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,845
camp.

968
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,244
>> We won the challenge, and we

969
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,871
had the option of giving up our

970
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:55,913
home or vote somebody off.

971
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,415
So unfortunately, we're going to

972
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,041
vote somebody off.

973
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,918
And it's even uglier being that

974
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,253
Gary left yesterday, so it's

975
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,338
kind of like we're losing two

976
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,172
people.

977
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,173
>> All right, let's sit down and

978
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,090
talk for a second.

979
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,175
This is what I feel is very

980
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,509
important to me.

981
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,135
I'm going... I'm not going to

982
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,136
sugarcoat nothing.

983
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,180
I think we are a tribe, right?

984
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,848
We're honest, right?

985
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,182
Are we snakes?

986
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,059
Anybody here a snake?

987
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,352
Not yet.

988
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,394
We ain't snakes yet.

989
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,520
And let's not turn into snakes

990
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,480
yet.

991
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,397
So with that being said and out

992
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,107
of the way, there's two people

993
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,192
we can afford to lose now.

994
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,902
I ain't pointing no fingers.

995
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,197
It's Cassandra and Lisi.

996
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,531
We can only afford to lose them,

997
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,699
right?

998
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,033
Am I right?

999
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,910
If I'm not right, if anybody

1000
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:34,786
objects...

1001
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,620
>> It depends on how you look

1002
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,412
it.

1003
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,205
>> I think that's are the only

1004
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,039
two people you can afford to

1005
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:38,998
lose.

1006
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,416
>> I'll be sincere.

1007
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm not going to vote for Lisi.

1008
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:43,920
I like Lisi.

1009
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:44,462
Cassandra, I'm going to be

1010
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,213
straight with you.

1011
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,130
Probably my vote tonight will be

1012
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,299
against you.

1013
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,467
>> Here's the thing, Dreamz.

1014
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,760
I don't think you can ignore the

1015
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,095
interpersonal relationships that

1016
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,388
have been built, not because

1017
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,514
it's a friendship, but it's also

1018
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,557
in thinking long-term, that bond

1019
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,476
may help you in the future.

1020
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,894
>> We're not individuals yet.

1021
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:00,353
We're still a group.

1022
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,522
>> Dreamz started freaking out.

1023
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,815
I think he shoots from the hip a

1024
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,441
lot, and he's a bit naive.

1025
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,609
Because he has no clue what's

1026
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,652
going on.

1027
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,654
He thinks we're all part of this

1028
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,114
solid team, that we do things

1029
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,740
together in stride.

1030
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,659
And it's not entirely untrue,

1031
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,911
it's just that the team consists

1032
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,372
of five people-- myself, Alex,

1033
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,874
Ed, Lisi, and Boo.

1034
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,500
>> If anybody else got something

1035
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,586
to say, please.

1036
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,674
So is that what we're going to

1037
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,175
do?

1038
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,680
>> Well we've got to decide

1039
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,472
something now before we start,

1040
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,265
"Come with me to the water

1041
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,057
fountain real quick.

1042
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:38,599
Come with me to..." you know

1043
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,809
what I'm saying?

1044
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,560
That's when we turn to snakes

1045
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,352
and start biting each other.

1046
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,145
We don't have to eat each other

1047
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:42,311
yet.

1048
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,980
We don't have to do that yet.

1049
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:44,939
Let's not do it yet.

1050
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:45,857
>> I don't know, I don't know.

1051
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,649
>> I just want things to go down

1052
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,483
fair so we don't have to see the

1053
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,234
snake so early.

1054
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,863
>> Uh-huh.

1055
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:02,623
>> Like, it's not that we don't

1056
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,333
like you and we don't think

1057
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,460
you're a good person, because I

1058
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,502
think you rock.

1059
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,462
>> No, I understand.

1060
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,963
>> The thing is, it would be a

1061
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,590
backward step for me to go

1062
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,966
against what they're doing.

1063
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:12,842
I'm going to try to stay in this

1064
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,593
game longer.

1065
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,343
>> Yeah.

1066
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,261
All I'll say is just, you know,

1067
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,220
hang in there.

1068
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,388
It could be me going home this

1069
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,514
evening after tribal council.

1070
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,016
But I don't want to be the first

1071
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:20,975
voted out of my tribe.

1072
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:21,934
I didn't want to be the first

1073
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:22,852
voted out of the game.

1074
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,312
So I'm holding on.

1075
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,664
>> I think Dreamz is better for

1076
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,749
us, so we need to keep Dreamz.

1077
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,417
>> We need to keep Dreamz, okay?

1078
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,215
>> I vote Liliana, too.

1079
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,132
>> Let's do it.

1080
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,426
She's going to be like...

1081
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,137
As far as I'm concerned, Liliana

1082
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,472
is the weakest link.

1083
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,098
Because our biggest concern is

1084
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:01,682
to get to the top five, and

1085
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,308
she's the one person that could

1086
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,267
threaten it.

1087
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,268
She could try to manipulate

1088
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
things.

1089
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,563
She could say all sorts of

1090
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,564
things that could start tearing

1091
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,732
us apart.

1092
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,691
>> If we take out Liliana...

1093
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,652
Cassandra is bad at everything.

1094
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,904
She sucks at everything.

1095
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,239
>> It's not... we're not going

1096
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,532
to be hurting.

1097
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,116
I swear to you.

1098
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,284
>> The most logical thing is to

1099
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,160
keep Liliana, vote out Cassandra

1100
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,913
until we have a numbers

1101
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,914
advantage again.

1102
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,207
Right now we're 7-7.

1103
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,959
Why on god's green earth would

1104
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:28,543
you vote out a woman who is as

1105
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,586
strong, almost as any of the

1106
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,504
men?

1107
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,839
That to me seems absurd.

1108
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,549
>> One of them has got to go.

1109
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,842
>> I'm voting Liliana.

1110
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,759
>> Me, too.

1111
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,760
>> I'm very frustrated.

1112
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,719
I feel like this is illogical.

1113
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,762
I want to do what's best for our

1114
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,138
five-person alliance and for the

1115
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,598
team in general.

1116
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,059
Liliana is a good person.

1117
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,352
She's worked hard at these

1118
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,353
challenges.

1119
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,479
She deserves to stay.

1120
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,940
Cassandra should go.

1121
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,788
>> PROBST: Behind each of you is

1122
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,706
a torch.

1123
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,707
Go ahead and grab a torch and

1124
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,332
approach the flame.

1125
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,670
Dip it in, get fire.

1126
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,922
This is part of the ritual of

1127
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,257
tribal council, because in this

1128
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,383
game, fire represents life.

1129
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,510
As long as you have fire, you're

1130
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,553
still in the game.

1131
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,804
When your fire is gone, so are

1132
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,139
you.

1133
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,141
Boo, tell me about the loss of

1134
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:25,349
Gary.

1135
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,434
What was the reaction when he

1136
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,895
had to leave?

1137
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,897
>> Everyone, even the other

1138
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,940
tribe, loved Gary.

1139
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,567
He was sick for three days, and

1140
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,485
he stayed tough for our tribe.

1141
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,113
We miss him, and we can't wait

1142
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,239
to see him again.

1143
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,490
>> PROBST: Dreamz, let's talk

1144
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,575
about friendship.

1145
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,910
Are you starting to bond with

1146
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,161
certain people maybe more than

1147
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:45,411
others?

1148
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,370
>> Pretty much Papa Smurf and

1149
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,371
Cassandra.

1150
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,290
But I'm not going to lie to you.

1151
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,374
The rest of them, if I talk they

1152
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,834
just get silent or they don't

1153
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,920
talk back.

1154
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,171
>> PROBST: Edgardo, can you

1155
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,172
understand what Dreamz is

1156
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,214
saying?

1157
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,591
>> I really don't know where

1158
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,550
he's coming from.

1159
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,509
I think we all, you know, treat

1160
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,011
each other the same way.

1161
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,054
You know, I treat Liliana the

1162
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,513
same way I treat Dreamz or Boo.

1163
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,681
But if he feels that way, I'm

1164
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,933
going to make sure he doesn't

1165
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:07,433
feel that way anymore.

1166
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,518
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1167
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,103
today's challenge.

1168
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,563
Lisi, in spite of the fact that

1169
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,148
you won, you have to come to

1170
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:14,482
tribal council.

1171
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,692
So what happens at camp?

1172
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,110
>> As a matter of fact, Dreamz

1173
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,362
goes on a soliloquy about how,

1174
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,114
you know, some people should be

1175
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,075
voted off, the weakest ones...

1176
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,242
>> Jeff...

1177
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:25,701
>> Cassandra and Lisi.

1178
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,286
So he's talking about being

1179
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,371
indivisible, but he's pointing

1180
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,330
fingers.

1181
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,082
Hello!

1182
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,333
>> PROBST: So, Dreamz, you come

1183
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,001
back to camp and you decide,

1184
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:34,585
"Let's just have a powwow and

1185
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,545
I'm going tell you how it is."

1186
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,797
>> Well, not like that, Jeff.

1187
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,382
Don't make me sound like a

1188
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,716
monster.

1189
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,884
>> PROBST: I'm asking!

1190
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,969
>> All right.

1191
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:43,886
I was just saying, "Stop me if

1192
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,887
I'm wrong, if y'all think I'm

1193
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,805
wrong at any point in time."

1194
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,973
Nobody stopped me, Jeff.

1195
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,101
They let me go on a shaquila, or

1196
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,560
whatever she called it.

1197
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,645
>> PROBST: Soliloquy.

1198
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,063
>> She let me go on a soliloquy,

1199
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,231
or whatever they call it.

1200
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,232
I didn't want to eat each other

1201
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:56,857
yet, you know what I'm saying?

1202
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,525
I didn't want people to go off

1203
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,402
into little groups and start

1204
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,319
talking about people.

1205
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,196
>> PROBST: So Alex, you didn't

1206
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:02,655
lose, but you're here.

1207
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,489
You don't want to vote somebody

1208
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,448
out, but you have to.

1209
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,617
What do you base it on?

1210
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,035
>> I think you base it on what's

1211
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,370
going to be best for the tribe

1212
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,705
moving forward, and we're going

1213
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,873
to just move on and do whatever

1214
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,166
it takes to make sure that Ravu

1215
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,126
doesn't have another opportunity

1216
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,127
to have one of our members voted

1217
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,294
out.

1218
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:17,920
>> PROBST: Liliana, what do you

1219
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,880
bring to this tribe?

1220
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,506
>> I feel that I bring strength,

1221
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:25,177
and I try to get with the guys

1222
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,512
and say, "Let's go fishing or

1223
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,346
hunting or climbing."

1224
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,514
So helping the guys out is not a

1225
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,683
problem for me.

1226
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,767
That's just the way I am at

1227
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,686
home, and I'm here being the

1228
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,563
same person.

1229
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,605
>> PROBST: Cassandra.

1230
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,565
>> I definitely want to

1231
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,691
compliment Liliana.

1232
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,151
She's exemplary for the female

1233
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:40,401
strength.

1234
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,360
She's just amazing.

1235
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,279
I just look for her to go very

1236
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:43,654
far in the game.

1237
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,032
Love you.

1238
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,241
>> Love you, too.

1239
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,201
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1240
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:49,452
to vote.

1241
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,997
Alex, you're up.

1242
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,969
>> I'm going to really miss you.

1243
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,054
You're such a great person.

1244
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,138
I really did see the strength in

1245
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,557
you.

1246
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,322
>> The alliance is five, not

1247
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,283
six.

1248
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,553
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1249
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,639
votes.

1250
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,443
Once the votes are read, the

1251
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,736
decision is final.

1252
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,821
The person voted out will be

1253
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,780
asked to leave the tribal

1254
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,572
council area immediately.

1255
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,492
I'll read the votes.

1256
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,245
First vote, Liliana.

1257
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,625
Lisi.

1258
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,794
One vote Liliana, one vote Lisi.

1259
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,882
Cassandra.

1260
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,967
That's one vote each for

1261
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,847
Liliana, Lisi, and Cassandra.

1262
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,597
Liliana.

1263
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,892
Two votes Liliana.

1264
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,564
Liliana.

1265
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,274
That's three votes Liliana, one

1266
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:47,695
vote Lisi, one vote Cassandra.

1267
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,281
Fourth person voted out of

1268
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,200
<i>Survivor: Fiji,</i> Liliana.

1269
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:53,576
>> Wow.

1270
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,535
>> PROBST: That's four.

1271
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,370
That's enough.

1272
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:57,913
You need to bring me your torch.

1273
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,582
>> I'm so shocked.

1274
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,376
So shocked.

1275
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,339
If they didn't get me out now, I

1276
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:07,840
was going to beat them.

1277
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,508
>> PROBST: Liliana, the tribe

1278
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,677
has spoken.

1279
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,694
>> PROBST: Well, I think

1280
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,654
Liliana's expression said it

1281
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,780
all.

1282
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,365
This game definitely being

1283
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,617
played within the Moto tribe.

1284
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,618
Grab your torches.

1285
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,577
Head back to camp.

1286
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,829
Good night.

1287
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,343
>> PROBST: stay tuned for scenes

1288
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,470
from our next episode.

1289
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,641
>> PROBST: Next time on

1290
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:58,933
<i>Survivor:</i>

1291
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,558
>> Those two are two sour

1292
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,310
apples.

1293
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,061
>> PROBST: Moto begins to

1294
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,230
fracture.

1295
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,732
>> PROBST: The hunt for the idol

1296
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,608
is on.

1297
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,108
>> I got a chance to dig.

1298
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,818
I don't know for how long.

1299
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,153
>> Laugh it up.

1300
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:11,987
>> Why don't me and you go up

1301
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:12,613
there right now?

1302
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:12,905
>> We could.

1303
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,365
>> Let's do that then.

1304
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:14,990
Keep running your mouth.

1305
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:15,658
Bring it.

1306
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,283
>> PROBST: And the gloves come

1307
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,702
off.

1308
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,583
>> Well, I'm definitely 100%

1309
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,502
shocked.

1310
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,127
To me, it's ridiculous to get

1311
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:27,670
rid of one of your stronger

1312
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,796
people in the beginning.

1313
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,965
I just wish I could have stayed

1314
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,424
in longer, because I definitely

1315
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,676
would have kicked some butt.

1316
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,427
Wow, there are some good liars,

1317
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,388
