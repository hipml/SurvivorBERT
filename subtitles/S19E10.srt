00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,669
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:03,336
<i>Survivor: </i>After the merge...

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,171
>> We're now one tribe!

4
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,256
>> PROBST: The old Galu tribe

5
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,424
was up eight to four.

6
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,758
>> Right now, the Galu tribe is

7
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,634
tight.

8
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,677
We confirmed, that you know

9
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,761
what? Let's stick together.

10
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,554
>> PROBST: And they anticipated

11
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,013
that the rest of the old Foa Foa

12
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:14,639
would go out quickly and easily.

13
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,682
>> What you need to know

14
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,769
you know.

15
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,395
>> PROBST: But the Foa Foa four

16
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,064
resolved not to go out gently.

17
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,149
>> We all hoped to put a big

18
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,859
dent in that arrogance and

19
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,152
patronizing attitude they have

20
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:27,777
towards us.

21
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,570
>> PROBST: First they convinced

22
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,821
the old Galu to vote out one of

23
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,405
their own.

24
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,490
>> I don't trust Erik.

25
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,453
>> PROBST: When Erik left,

26
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,162
Galu's numbers dropped down to

27
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,538
seven.

28
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,623
The tribe has spoken.

29
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,334
At the next Tribal Council, the

30
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,294
old Galu was set to take out

31
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,796
Russell.

32
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,381
But he shocked them by playing

33
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,008
the hidden immunity idol.

34
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,384
>> Keep hope alive.

35
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,677
>> PROBST: So Kelly went home,

36
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,720
leaving Galu with only six

37
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,805
members.

38
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,019
Or so it would seem.

39
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,103
But the old Galu doesn't know

40
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,773
that one of their own, Shambo,

41
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,274
is conspiring with Russell to

42
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,233
get rid of Laura.

43
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,569
>> Shambo hates Laura.

44
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,154
She hates her.

45
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,572
>> Laura needs to go.

46
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,199
She's the bane of my existence.

47
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,200
>> PROBST: Well, since the

48
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,159
merge, there have been two

49
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,118
Tribal Councils, two

50
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,495
blind sides, two hidden immunity

51
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,455
idols played, and once again,

52
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,165
the Foa Foa foursome have

53
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,750
survived the vote.

54
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,292
One more thing, the hidden

55
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,795
immunity idol goes back into

56
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,880
the game.

57
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,860
>> My work is done.

58
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,278
It's like a painting, like a

59
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,321
Picasso, you know?

60
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,156
He's a great artist.

61
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,158
This is my artwork.

62
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,536
This might be one of my best

63
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,330
pieces of work I've ever done.

64
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,834
There's going to be a pretty

65
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:06,876
expensive sale.

66
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,919
They'll write me a check for

67
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,712
$1 million for this work, so I

68
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,464
can take that...

69
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,258
Take that to the bank.

70
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,761
>> If you guys tell Galu I said

71
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,931
this-- "good move!"

72
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,474
>> Let me tell you something,

73
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,726
that was almost as great as my

74
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,185
kids being born.

75
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,020
(laughter)

76
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,648
>> Dude.

77
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,983
>> Wow.

78
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,777
>> Yeah, wow.

79
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,364
>> I cannot believe that little

80
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,533
snake...

81
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,285
>> Part of the game.

82
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,202
>> Yep.

83
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,579
>> Yes, it is.

84
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,913
>> We've still got the numbers.

85
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,834
>> It was quite the shock at

86
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,960
Tribal Council tonight when

87
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:49,961
Russell pulled out that second

88
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,963
hidden immunity idol.

89
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,715
We know that he's sneaky and

90
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,133
that he just, like, lurks

91
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,426
around camp and he's always

92
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,511
snooping around.

93
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,387
We should have known better.

94
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,680
We really should have known

95
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,764
better.

96
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,808
>> Oh, you're in trouble.

97
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,434
>> (laughing)

98
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,602
>> Oh, my God,

99
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,729
the look on her face when you

100
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,396
played that immunity idol.

101
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,732
Do you know what she said when

102
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,983
they said, "Kelly, bring me

103
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,275
your torch."

104
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,069
She goes, "He has ruined

105
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,071
everything."

106
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,323
And it was all I could do to

107
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,657
keep a straight face.

108
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,326
>> I ruined everything?

109
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,368
What does she think I'm here

110
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,411
for her, for to bake her

111
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,496
cookies and cakes?

112
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,332
(laughter)

113
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,376
>> Nobody out of the 11

114
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,836
people had a clue what the hell

115
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,171
was going on with the exception

116
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,839
of me and Russ, and when he got

117
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,465
up and played that immunity

118
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,926
idol, the look on Laura's face--

119
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,385
she was just pissed.

120
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,387
It was awesome.

121
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,140
And I was thinking I got to

122
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,266
find that immunity idol, give

123
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,352
it to Russ again.

124
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,842
♪ ♪

125
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,641
>> It's a new beginning.

126
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,642
Jeff said the immunity idol is

127
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,060
back in the game, and I'll be

128
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,228
here looking for it, and I will

129
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,230
find it.

130
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:32,772
It will be the third one.

131
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,440
It's like, they're like magnets

132
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,442
to me.

133
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,528
I'm just drawn to them.

134
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,367
>> Okay.

135
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,452
Work.

136
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,545
>> Laura is the head viper.

137
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,006
She is the viper queen of Galu.

138
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,424
She is the snake of the tribe.

139
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,341
She is the evil demon.

140
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,427
She's a beast.

141
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,095
Laura has been the first one to

142
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,097
go in my mind since day one.

143
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,224
>> I want to relax a bit this

144
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,183
morning.

145
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:09,851
I want to swing by the wall,

146
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,685
Sham, and just...

147
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:10,893
>> Yeah.

148
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,437
I got four Foa Foa.

149
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:12,729
I got me.

150
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,480
We're on an even playing field

151
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,523
right now.

152
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,441
I have to have John.

153
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,358
He's my number six.

154
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:17,734
Hold on a second.

155
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,611
Come here.

156
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,780
>> What's up?

157
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,489
>> Here's the thing-- you know,

158
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,574
it's all well and fine that

159
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,701
everybody wants to espouse

160
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,702
purple power.

161
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,369
There is no purple.

162
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,122
It takes balls to jump into

163
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:31,414
this arena.

164
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,373
And how far do you want to

165
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,751
extend your life?

166
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,294
The next immunity challenge,

167
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,420
just like the last two, Laura's

168
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,881
won, and both times, Laura was

169
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,758
supposed to go for the majority

170
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,217
of the tribe.

171
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,469
So I want to know that if she

172
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,970
doesn't win it, will you be the

173
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,805
sixth vote to put her out?

174
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,098
>> I don't have an answer to

175
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,600
that question right now.

176
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,851
I don't.

177
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,061
I believe I am the only one

178
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,062
from Galu that knows that

179
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,064
Shambo has flipped.

180
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,106
Now the question is what are

181
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,108
you going to do with it?

182
00:05:59,192 --> 00:05:59,942
>> Will you betray my

183
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,069
confidence that I asked you

184
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:01,736
that question?

185
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,154
>> I won't-- I won't-- I will

186
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,113
look you straight in the eyes

187
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,031
and I will not tell anyone

188
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,656
that you asked me that question.

189
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,532
Things are on the table with

190
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,367
Shambo.

191
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,202
She thinks she's in good with

192
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:09,577

00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,359
Purple has one flag left.

384
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,693
>> Hang on, baby!

385
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,779
Hang on, baby!

386
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,237
>> Hold on, Natalie!

387
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,739
>> PROBST: Natalie, don't fall

388
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,782
out.

389
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,785
>> Go, go, go, go!

390
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,619
>> Hang on, Natalie.

391
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,078
Last one.

392
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,204
>> We got this, we got this!

393
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:03,412
Yeah!

394
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,580
>> PROBST: That's it!

395
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:05,581
Purple has the 15th

396
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,207
and final flag.

397
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,708
Got to get it in the slot.

398
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,167
>> Keep your ropes up.

399
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,709
>> Go, go, go!

400
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,920
>> Slowly, don't let her fall.

401
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,046
>> PROBST: For a nice reward.

402
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:12,963
>> Come on!

403
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,465
You know what it's for!

404
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,674
>> Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

405
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,678
>> PROBST: Purple wins reward!

406
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,597
Russell, Brett, Dave Ball,

407
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,098
Laura and Natalie going

408
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,892
on reward.

409
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,812
>> Good girl. Come on.

410
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,440
>> Come on, Nat.

411
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,024
>> You were awesome!

412
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:32,858
>> That was great!

413
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,193
>> PROBST: Purple,

414
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,277
congratulations.

415
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,654
You're gonna enjoy a

416
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,738
wonderful afternoon.

417
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,948
In addition, Palm Pre by Sprint.

418
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,158
Make some memories.

419
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,076
Take some photos.

420
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,285
Enjoy it.

421
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,286
>> Thank you.

422
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,996
>> PROBST: John, Monica,

423
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,915
Jaison, Shambo, Mick, got

424
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,290
nothing for you.

425
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,708
Grab your stuff.

426
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,918
Head back to camp.

427
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,962
>> If I can find this clue for

428
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,047
the next hidden immunity idol,

429
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:55,798
then I can't see how it's not

430
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,467
gonna be possible for me to

431
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,219
do what I want to do and take

432
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,179
out Laura.

433
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,814
>> We won a reward today:

434
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,150
Natalie, me,

435
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,193
Laura, Brett, and Dave.

436
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:16,944
Now, we get to fly to another

437
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,364
island, eat and take pictures

438
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,907
with a Sprint phone, which is

439
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,158
wonderful.

440
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:38,507
I need to eat, bad.

441
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:38,966
>> It's like a little

442
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:39,842
Gilligan's island or something,

443
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,802
huh?

444
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,555
>> Oh, my word, it's so cool.

445
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,139
>> I think that's the island

446
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,765
we're going to.

447
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:56,567
>> Really?

448
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,526
>> Who's gonna eat?

449
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,111
>> Uh!

450
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,279
>> I'm gonna eat.

451
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,031
>> Oh, my gosh!

452
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:02,364
It's hot dogs!

453
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:07,369
That I love! Oh!

454
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,037
>> Give me a plate.

455
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,498
>> I want some of that good

456
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,415
old pie.

457
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,458
>> I've had dreams about you,

458
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,209
baby.

459
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,210
>> Oh, my goodness, finally,

460
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,712
day 26, I get to go on a reward

461
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,047
and I needed the food.

462
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,507
I literally was, like,

463
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,424
wasting away.

464
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,260
>> Oh, my God! Try that pie.

465
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,512
>> It felt just like home.

466
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,054
It was really, really nice.

467
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,181
I just felt really thankful to

468
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,599
have gotten to go.

469
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,183
>> Thank you for allowing me

470
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,268
and Russell to come on our

471
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,061
first reward.

472
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,604
>> Congratulations.

473
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,146
>> I'm glad you guys could

474
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,481
take part.

475
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,942
>> You guys. One, two, three.

476
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,080
>> Seems like you guys are

477
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,039
pretty tight.

478
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,041
I know we're tight.

479
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:54,667
>> Mm-hmm.

480
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,502
>> I know where the votes are

481
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,545
right now.

482
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,087
>> Mm-hmm.

483
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,964
>> And...

484
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,175
you know, if we, if we

485
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,219
essentially feel like if we get

486
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,762
one more on our side, we're

487
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,847
willing to offer them a very,

488
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,473
very good deal.

489
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,226
>> I don't know.

490
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,103
Just don't know.

491
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,396
You know what I mean?

492
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:15,604
>> Yeah.

493
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,815
>> It's risky.

494
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,400
>> We just need to make a

495
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,693
decision, go to challenge, and

496
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,151
go to Tribal Council.

497
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,070
>> But, I mean, we need

498
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,613
another-- we need one more vote.

499
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,239
>> No, we don't.

500
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:25,948
>> No, we don't.

501
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,283
>> Yeah, we do.

502
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,284
>> You're number six.

503
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:28,909
>> It's still gonna be 5-5.

504
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,036
>> We have five besides you.

505
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,162
>> Five besides you.

506
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,080
>> You are number six.

507
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:33,831
>> You're six.

508
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,082
>> Which is why we asked.

509
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:35,374
We need six.

510
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,125
>> How sure are you?

511
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,543
>> 115%.

512
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,127
>> How do you know they're not

513
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,254
just saying it to you?

514
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,880
>> We know.

515
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,424
'Cause let's put it this way--

516
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,049
this person knew about the last

517
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,968
Tribal Council.

518
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,428
>> Right.

519
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,722
And he or she actually

520
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,266
encouraged things to make that

521
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,350
whole thing happen.

522
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,060
>> I'm thinking that one of the

523
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,270
other people that they're

524
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,104
talking about is Shambo.

525
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,064
Shambo could be the fifth vote

526
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,025
for the Foa Foas.

527
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,985
You can't tell me who that is?

528
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,278
>> No, we won't.

529
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,156
>> I want John out.

530
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,910
>> We can absolutely do that.

531
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,497
>> Great.

532
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,374
>> What a great day, guys.

533
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,668
>> This is phenomenal.

534
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,170
Best reward so far, Dave?

535
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,546
>> Best reward so far.

536
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,964
>> Looking through the photos,

537
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,132
I seen a note that's telling us

538
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,010
"Go to your memo board," and

539
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,054
you'll get the clue.

540
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,597
First thing that pops in my

541
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,307
head-- hidden immunity idol.

542
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,099
That would be my third one.

543
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,436
>> "This Palm in your hand

544
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,354
"holds much information which

00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,314
"you better heed or it will be

"your own loss.

547
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,234
"The immunity idol is no

"rolling stone.

"A rolling stone gathers

no moss."

551
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,407
>> A rolling stone gathers what?

552
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:50,741
>> "No moss."

553
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,618
>> I'm gonna look all over

554
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:52,993
the place.

555
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,161
I'll find it, for sure.

556
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,954
I'll find it.

557
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,247
>> "Go to videos to watch an

558
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,749
"additional clue to the hidden

immunity idol."

560
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,042
Okay, I'll watch it and then

561
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,585
pass it on.

562
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,295
"Additional hint."

563
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,592
>> The immunity idol is under a

564
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,760
stinking rock.

565
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,177
>> Eight seconds.

566
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,761
That's it.

567
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,096
>> I ain't got to see it again.

568
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,180
As soon as I go back to camp,

569
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,307
I'm gonna start looking for

570
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,809
it 'cause I need the immunity

571
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,227
idol for myself.

572
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,154
>> Shambo!

573
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,156
>> Hi, you guys!

574
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,410
Hello! I missed you!

575
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,251
It's about that big.

576
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,502
It's not a round rock.

577
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:43,794
It's square.

578
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,087
It has moss on it.

579
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,046
>> Can you show us there?

580
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,755
>> They're moving.

581
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,131
>> No.

582
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:47,673
>> Those guys are already

583
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,549
moving.

584
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,550
>> We totally underestimated

585
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,551
Russell's capability of finding

586
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,594
the idol.

587
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,722
What we need to do is keep that

588
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,223
hidden immunity idol out of

589
00:16:56,306 --> 00:17:07,526
Russell's hands.

590
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,652
>> It's time to hunt.

591
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,820
>> I guess so.

592
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,279
>> The party's on.

593
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,575
>> There you go.

594
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,200
>> You finding for the same

595
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,327
thing I'm looking for, Jaison?

596
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,078
>> I don't know.

597
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,580
What are you looking for?

598
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,080
>> You're the one that's

599
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,081
lifting up rocks.

600
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,291
>> Here's a green.

601
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,042
>> No, it's too new.

602
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,170
I know that it has to be where

603
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,421
that wall is in camp.

604
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,006
They have a rock in a little

605
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:29,757
hole, square hole.

606
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,299
Looks like the rock in the

607
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,759
picture to me.

608
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,593
Dave's following me around,

609
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,135
turning over rocks.

610
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,511
I get nervous at first 'cause

611
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,513
I think I see the rock and then

612
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,723
he turns it over and

613
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,140
nothing's there.

614
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,850
So I'm figuring if all of

615
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,225
this...

616
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,186
You think you can run with me?

617
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,146
>> We're just gonna put y'all...

618
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:44,813
Oh, man!

619
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,690
>> Slow down, Russ!

620
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,274
>> All right. Come on, Dave.

621
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,193
>> Slow down, man, slow down!

622
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,110
All right.

623
00:17:50,194 --> 00:18:04,875
Come on, Dave.

624
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,626
>> I came back

625
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,877
to the same location.

626
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,545
I'm looking at the wall.

627
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,338
Look down there.

628
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,516
There it is.

629
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,102
Oh, my God.

630
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,271
Oh, man.

631
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,983
This is getting way too easy.

632
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,776
I'm enjoying it.

633
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,944
I'm just running around.

634
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,445
I'm having more fun now than

635
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,988
I've ever had, and my butt's

636
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,198
probably in the sling more than

637
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,282
ever, but not if they think I

638
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,159
have an idol.

639
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,119
I'm gonna be a-okay.

640
00:18:44,832 --> 00:19:02,266
♪ ♪

641
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:13,902
I mean...

642
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,195
I don't trust Shambo or John.

643
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,989
And Shambo hates you.

644
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,283
And she's pissed, Laura.

645
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,702
We have to be careful.

646
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,245
They might come after you.

647
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,248
>> They'll come after me first.

648
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,416
I think the Foa Foa people are

649
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,167
coming after me.

650
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,794
I've had a target on my head

651
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,004
from them from day one.

652
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,047
Sham just completely

653
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:34,339
despises me.

654
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,341
I need to be on the top of my

655
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,094
game, and I have to win this

656
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:46,393
challenge.

657
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,521
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

658
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,356
You guys ready to get to

659

today's immunity challenge?

660
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,442
>> Yes, sir.

661
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:53,734
>> Yes, sir.

662
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,401
>> PROBST: First things first,

663
00:19:54,484 --> 00:20:01,950
Laura, give it up.

664
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,870
Once again, immunity back up

665
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,704
for grabs.

666
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,747
Today's challenge happens in

667
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,789
two parts:

668
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,373
first part, you'll have three

669
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,709
tiles of the same color

670
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,961
arranged close together.

671
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,172
Your goal? Throw one rock and

672
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,423
attempt to break as many of

673
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,966
these tiles as you can.

674
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,301
For every tile you break, you

675
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,595
earn a spear, which you will

676
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,346
use in the second part of the

677
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,389
challenge when you will shoot

678
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,350
your spears at a target.

679
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,935
Person who lands their spear

680
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,270
closest to the target wins

681
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,106
immunity, guaranteed a one-in-

682
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,942
nine shot at a million dollars.

683
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,109
Losers, Tribal Council.

684
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,778
Somebody will be voted out.

685
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,278
Make sense?

686
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:38,904
>> Yeah.

687
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:39,279
>> Yeah.

688
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,197
Makes sense.

689
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,323
>> PROBST: We draw for spots.

690
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,866
We'll get started.

691
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,077
All right, everybody grab

692
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,620
one rock.

693
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,081
If you want a shot at immunity,

694
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,708
you've got to break a tile.

695
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,669
These tiles are arranged

696
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,753
close together.

697
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,879
That means you could break

698
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,964
multiple tiles.

699
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,173
It also means somebody could

700
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:58,632
break one of yours.

701
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,343
But you've only got one throw.

702
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,387
Here we go.

703
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,555
Ready?

704
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,683
Aim...

705
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,309
and throw.

706
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,436
>> Son of a gun!

707
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,354
>> PROBST: Shambo just misses.

708
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,565
Russell goes low.

709
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,527
Jaison's on the board with

710
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,904
one spear.

711
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,489
>> Damn.

712

>> PROBST: Fincher just misses.

713
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,288

>> Enjoy, money.

719
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,296
>> Thanks, honey.

720
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:38,672

You want a shot at immunity,

this is it.

733
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,485
You have to break a tile.

734
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,575
That's it.

second part of the challenge.

00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,496
mark set by Brett, currently in

763
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,664
that second ring.

764
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,376
>> Oh!

765
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,419
>> PROBST: Jaison misses the

766
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,921
target completely.

767
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,715
Jaison, no shot at immunity.

768
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,467
Monica.

769
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,260
Monica here thanks to Dave Ball

770
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,346
who broke one of Monica's tiles.

771
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,853
Monica fires.

772
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,231
Hits the target but too low.

773
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,357
Monica, no shot at immunity.

774
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,233
>> Good shot.

775
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:21,858
>> Good job.

776
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,026
>> Good try, Monica.

777
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,779
>> PROBST: Mick.

778
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,656
One spear.

779
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,491
That's all it takes, one shot

780
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,535
could win it.

781
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,626
Mick with a great shot.

782
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,962
Puts his spear inside of

783
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:42,879
Brett's.

784
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,464
Mick is the new mark to beat.

785
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,174
It comes down to this.

786
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,592
Brett, one spear left.

787
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,386
You know what you have to do.

788
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,471
Take your shot.

789
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,685
>> Take your time, babe.

790
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,566
>> PROBST: Brett hits too low.

791
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,192
Mick wins individual immunity.

792
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,068
(applause)

793
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,695
>> Good job, Mick.

794
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,865
>> PROBST: Mick, come on over.

795
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,490
Congratulations.

796
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,201
>> Thank you.

797
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,120
>> PROBST: Mick safe at

798
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,372
tonight's Tribal Council.

799
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,707
For one of you, that will be as

800
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,041
far as it goes.

801
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:20,876
Grab your stuff.

802
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,251
Head back to camp.

803
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:21,793
I will see you tonight at

804
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,211
Tribal Council.

805
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:23,628
Congratulations.

806
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,504
>> Thank you.

807
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,423
>> I believe it is the destiny

808
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,674
of Laura to go home.

809
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,635
Today is the day of reckoning.

810
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,721
Medusa's head will be lopped

811
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,806
off.

812
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,657
>> Does anybody want any of this

813
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,659
coconut?

814
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,702
>> Are you going to open that

815
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:55,952
thing up?

816
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:56,620
>> I'm going to give it

817
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,246
a sh...

818
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,164
>> Isn't that the cotton candy

819
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,207
ones?

820
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,750
>> You got a feeling?

821
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,501
>> I got a feeling.

822
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,544
>> The plan is and always was

823
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,754
for the last nine days is get

824
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,463
rid of Laura.

825
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,172
She keeps winning immunity.

826
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,131
She finally loses, we got to

827
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,133
get rid of her.

828
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,093
I was happy about that.

829
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,386
Because I knew at least, okay,

830
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,388
at least, we have a tie.

831
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,098
And now, we have a fighting

832
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,309
chance because it's five to five

833
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,977
because Shambo is voting Laura.

834
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,562
There's no if, ands, and buts

835
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,688
about that.

836
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,023
She's voting Laura.

837
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,441
>> I'm voting for Laura

838
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,734
tonight, and I don't care who

839
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,610
else is doing what.

840
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,569
>> Mm-hmm.

841
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,613
>> I really don't.

842
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,948
But...

843
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,992
>> You're not going to

844
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:36,743
fluctuate or change at all?

845
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,661
>> There's no way in God's

846
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,038
green Earth.

847
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,414
Had she not won immunity the

848
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,540
last two times, that's whose

849
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,833
name I would have written down.

850
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:44,668
>> Mm-hmm.

851
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,752
>> She's too strong and she's

852
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,920
too manipulative.

853
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,880
>> Okay.

854
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:54,511
>> There is no more Galu.

855
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,347
>> Okay.

856
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,063
>> What's up?

857
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,189
>> We were going to ask,

858
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,524
because we were talking about

859
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,149
some stuff, and I said we need

860
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,818
to go talk to John.

861
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,735
Because he's the number

862
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,528
cruncher.

863
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,237
>> What's up?

864
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,321
>> Keep it simple, just get rid

865
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,322
of the Foa Foa.

866
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,699
Wait until the very last minute

867
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,659
so they don't know who it is.

868
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,494
We vote Russell.

869
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,954
If he has the idol, he plays

870
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,580
it, it flushes out--

871
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,206
>> Incorrect.

872
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:23,957
>> Okay.

873
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,375
>> The answer is Natalie.

874
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,376
>> Okay.

875
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,669
>> And the reason is she's the

876
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,004
least likely to have the idol

877
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:29,671
because she didn't look for it.

878
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,257
The vote is Natalie, times five.

879
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,799
>> Perfect.

880
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,717
>> Find a problem with that.

881
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,509
Is that wrong?

882
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:34,843
>> Five guys?

883
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,469
Okay, okay.

884
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,304
>> I know you'd rather not have

885
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,096
Natalie.

886
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:38,847
No, no, no, I like that.

887
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,764
>> I'll burn her right now, I

888
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,932
do not care, bro.

889
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,601
>> It's continually impressive

890
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,313
and bordering on annoying how

891
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:50,066
pathetic the analytical skills

892
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,068
of the Galu tribe are.

893
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,653
"Let's telegraph a move to

894
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,071
Russell."

895
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,281
You're an idiot.

896
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,532
"Let's sit back and let's piss

897
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,533
off Shambo."

898
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,118
You're an idiot.

899
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,661
"Let's sit back and vote off

900
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,788
Erik over a 30-second decision."

901
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,874
You're an idiot.

902
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,087
>> Mm-hmm.

903
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,088
>> Laura's going home.

904
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,173
>> No, no.

905
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,674
>> Yes, because Shambo will

906
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,509
vote for Laura.

907
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,886
>> I know, but it's a 5-5 tie.

908
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,012
5-5 tie.

909
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,305
It may be true--

910
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,431
>> Right.

911
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,640
>> But you're saying it as if it

912
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,725
is a certainty, game over.

913
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,893
That is not the case.

914
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,852
>> They're on the fence.

915
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,020
Some people are saying John.

916
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,063
>> That's great.

917
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,939
>> So if we say John, so keep

918
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:30,273
it with John?

919
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,649
>> So that means, like, we need

920
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,776
to go talk to Mick or something.

921
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,444
>> Oh, that's brilliant.

922
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,445
I'll say John, and then they

923
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,488
think they have two Galu saying

924
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,614
John.

925
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,239
>> Let's just think about it.

926
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:38,782
>> But it's an option.

927
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,408
It's a good option.

928
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,242
>> It is a good option.

929
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,118
Just don't get excited.

930
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:42,911
John is flighty.

931
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,288
So we don't want to do anything

932
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,039
premature.

933
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:46,831
We want to give it some more

934
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,082
thought.

935
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,416
>> Absolutely.

936
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,209
>> Because he gets nervous.

937
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,960
>> That's fine.

938
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,669
>> All right, cool.

939
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,921
>> This is a big move, you guys.

940
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:53,797
>> We'll make it happen.

941
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,757
It'll be beautiful.

942
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,216
>> Just be confident.

943
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,342
>> Yeah, be confident.

944
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,427
Confident.

945
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,640
>> Laura's my strongest ally

946
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,182
here, and I do not want to

947
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,017
throw her under the bus, so the

948
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:10,146
plan is for me to tell Foa Foa

949
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,774
that I am voting for John.

950
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,776
In reality, I would be voting

951
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,778
Natalie with my tribe.

952
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,739
So hopefully all goes to plan

953
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,491
and it'll be four Foa Foa

954
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,909
members voting John, five Galu

955
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,911
members voting Natalie, and

956
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,205
then the one, Shambo, voting

957
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,207
Laura.

958
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:29,833
Listen I think if we get rid of

959
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,626
John now.

960
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,293
>> Look I want to--

961
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,586
>> Listen, listen, if we do

962
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,838
it now, we still have Shambo

963
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,381
against Laura and then we have

964
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:36,881
even more numbers.

965
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,799
>> Look, look, look, look,

966
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,592
Shambo is not doing no other

967
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,677
vote but Laura tonight.

968
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,302
It's going to end up by being a

969
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:41,886
tie you don't go Laura.

970
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,055
And I was with that from the

971
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:44,806
beginning.

972
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,348
>> I'm not ready to write

973
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,641
Laura's name.

974
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:47,642
If I'm switching, this is a

975
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:48,643
huge move for me, Russell.

976
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:49,310
If I'm switching, I'm not going

977
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,979
to vote out, like...

978
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,230
I'm going to vote out someone I

979
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:52,939
want to vote out.

980
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,190
Do you see that?

981
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:54,774
>> Mm-hmm.

982
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,775
>> John's smart.

983
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,484
>> Yeah, I know.

984
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,527
I want to get rid of John.

985
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,112
We need to get him out now.

986
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,613
This is a huge move for me.

987
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,739
And the thing is, is that I

988
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,907
would rather take out John than

989
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,159
Laura.

990
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:04,826
>> Okay, all right.

991
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,663
>> Just because, I mean, in the

992
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:09,914
end, I need to have some sort

993
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,457
of security blanket, and I

994
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,458
don't trust John.

995
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,417
Do you see what I'm saying?

996
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:12,876
>> Yeah, yeah.

997
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,793
>> I don't know how much Foa

998
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,795
Foa can trust Monica.

999
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,840
She seems legit, or Laura has

1000
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,467
put, you know, a little snake

1001
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:20,884
in the grass to get

1002
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:21,926
information, which is almost as

1003
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,928
likely.

1004
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,972
>> She makes me a little

1005
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,098
nervous, but I like to think

1006
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:27,515
she's on our side.

1007
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:27,932
>> You know what?

1008
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,518
I want to get the okay from

1009
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,978
y'all, but I think the only way

1010
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,521
this is going to work is to let

1011
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,731
John know.

1012
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,773
>> Let John know what?

1013
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,025
>> Let him know that they're

1014
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,359
after him.

1015
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,153
That's the only way this is

1016
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,237
going to work, dude.

1017
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,113
>> He doesn't trust us.

1018
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,948
>> It's going to be a tie.

1019
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,076
It's going to be a tie.

1020
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,828
>> What's the plan?

1021
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,831
Where's Shambo at today?

1022
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,715
>> What's the response?

1023
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,595
>> It's like, trying to get

1024
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,513
them to vote for you, Shambo's

1025
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,180
voting for Laura, four would

1026
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:07,805
vote for you.

1027
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,389
And none of us would go for

1028
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:14,312
another one.

1029
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,438
>> Yeah, well, I haven't said

1030
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,356
anything.

1031
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,690
Shambo-- honestly, Shambo's

1032
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,525
going to vote for Laura no

1033
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,275
matter what.

1034
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,193
We've got to think of another

1035
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:20,902
option to deter their votes.

1036
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,531
>> Well, I can come up with

1037
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,823
something, but the answer is to

1038
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,991
not get four votes against me.

1039
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,911
The most recent development

1040
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,580
today is that the new best way

1041
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,083
to save Laura is to throw four

1042
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,085
Foa Foa votes behind John.

1043
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,671
Uh, no.

1044
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,964
It doesn't sound like a good

1045
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,966
plan when you're John.

1046
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,385
>> We're just thinking through

1047
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:45,969
ideas, how can we shake up the

1048
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,303
Foas?

1049
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,304
>> All right, you guys are

1050
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,180
betting my life that Shambo

1051
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:49,556
votes for Laura.

1052
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:55,144
We are betting nothing.

1053
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,312
>> I would.

1054
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:56,938
>> Well, let's bet yours and

1055
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,897
not mine, then.

1056
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,108
Because I wouldn't.

1057
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:00,900
>> Everyone's got your back.

1058
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,694
>> I'm not risking my life to

1059
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,861
save Laura's.

1060
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:04,904
Sorry, Laura, not in the cards.

1061
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,156
Laura picked a fight with

1062
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,658
somebody that I think is about

1063
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,034
to knock her out.

1064
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,494
And I'm not going to step in

1065
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,996
the way of the punch.

1066
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,039
>> I was born at night but not

1067
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:15,915
last night. Right?

1068
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,041
>> What have you heard?

1069
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,836
>> I believe that we're trying

1070
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,130
to be swindled into telling us

1071
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,548
to put your name down,

1072
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,425
everybody is.

1073
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,093
I don't believe that.

1074
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,011
We're putting Laura's name

1075
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,220
down, and we're going to go to

1076
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,138
the tie.

1077
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,139
>> If there is a tie tonight,

1078
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,558
the rules of <i>Survivor </i>state

1079
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,142
there is a re-vote.

1080
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,519
If there is a tie again, the

1081
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,771
remaining members now choose

1082
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:38,980
rocks.

1083
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,649
One of these rocks will be of

1084
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,859
different color, and that

1085
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,902
person will go home.

1086
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,362
>> If it goes to the tie,

1087
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,072
that's when it has to happen,

1088
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,115
the switch.

1089
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,492
>> If I vote for Laura tonight,

1090
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,328
after the tie, I wake up on

1091
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,746
this beach tomorrow.

1092
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,497
>> I done talked to everybody.

1093
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,540
Everybody's on the same page.

1094
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,583
We said whoever does the

1095
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,626
switch, that's who we know is

1096
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,627
on board.

1097
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,003
If they don't do the switch, we

1098
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,421
pick a rock.

1099
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,131
>> And-and what's the next vote?

1100
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,467
>> The next vote?

1101
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,509
>> If I'm going to give you

1102
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,344
Galu before you give me a Foa

1103
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,553
Foa, the next one needs to be

1104
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,679
Foa Foa.

1105
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,180
>> Okay.

1106
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:12,889
>> Deal?

1107
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,890
>> That's a deal.

1108
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,433
>> But Russell is a player.

1109
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,852
This guy is full of B.S.

1110
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:18,686
And it's clear the guy will do

1111
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,562
anything to progress in this

1112
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,105
game.

1113
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,148
My first instinct is the best

1114
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,525
situation that I can position

1115
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,528
myself in would be to vote with

1116
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,072
Galu, have a 5-5 tie, vote with

1117
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,367
Galu again, have another 5-5

1118
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,952
tie, and just pray to God that

1119
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:35,995
one of the Foa Foa members go.

1120
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,914
I don't know.

1121
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,207
I don't know what I'm going to

1122
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,250
do yet.

1123
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,264
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1124
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,350
the members of our jury.

1125
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,897
Erik and Kelly voted out at the

1126
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,024
last Tribal Council.

1127
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,280
John, are you surprised, two

1128
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,156
Tribal Councils, two Galu

1129
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,242
sitting over there?

1130
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,576
>> Absolutely.

1131
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,370
Both of the two votes so far

1132
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,038
were surprises to me.

1133
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,665
It's all a surprise.

1134
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,083
>> PROBST: Jaison, is it easier

1135
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,460
in some sense at this point to

1136
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,044
be the minority because with

1137
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,714
four, you don't have as many

1138
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,840
many options?

1139
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:29,424
You have to stick together.

1140
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,049
>> Sure, you could make

1141
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,884
that argument.

1142
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,052
And because we're the minority,

1143
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,595
if people want to use the

1144
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,263
votes, they can depend on our

1145
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,264
trustworthiness to go further.

1146
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,599
>> PROBST: John, what is

1147
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,560
appealing about the Foa Foa

1148
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,769
foursome?

1149
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,729
>> They've already said it.

1150
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,938
You can use four votes.

1151
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,397
It's plain and simple.

1152
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,733
>> Yeah, we've said it, but

1153
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,233
we still trying to find

1154
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,234
somebody.

1155
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,653
>> We're trying to figure out,

1156
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,238
like, at what point somebody

1157
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,072
says, "Oh, hey.

1158
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,491
This is an individual game,"

1159
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,160
and take advantage of our votes,

1160
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,954
and start playing their

1161
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:00,621
own game.

1162
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,165
>> PROBST: Shambo, is Galu one

1163
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,625
tight unit still?

1164
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,543
>> Negative.

1165
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,128
Absolutely not.

1166
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,796
The day that everybody decided

1167
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,299
to vote Erik off, Galu was

1168
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,593
broken to me.

1169
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,927
That's my humble opinion.

1170
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,180
>> PROBST: Laura, you're still

1171
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,724
staring at Shambo.

1172
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,767
>> I don't know who she's

1173
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,351
talking about because the Galu

1174
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,646
that I know, that I've been in,

1175
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,398
I feel is tight.

1176
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,484
>> PROBST: A group can't be

1177
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,985
tight if one of the members

1178
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:31,402
isn't.

1179
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,112
>> I guess it depends on how

1180
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,614
big of a group you're

1181
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:34,906
considering.

1182
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,407
>> PROBST: Well, here's what I

1183
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:36,783
would consider.

1184
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,951
If Shambo's on the fence, their

1185
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,203
four becomes five, your six

1186
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,454
becomes five-- we got a

1187
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,247
really interesting night

1188
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:43,498
in store.

1189
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,123
>> Absolutely.

1190
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,292
>> PROBST: Are you okay with it

1191
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,335
potentially coming down to a

1192
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,128
tie knowing that, if we revote

1193
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,755
and you're still tied,

1194
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,048
everybody over here will draw

1195
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,216
rocks, and the people who are

1196
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,425
tied will be safe?

1197
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,052
>> I'm absolutely not okay with

1198
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:56,427
taking a chance.

1199
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,304
But I'm not the only one in

1200
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,223
control of this game.

1201
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,933
I have these other people

1202
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,142
sitting next to me that have

1203
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,144
decisions to make as well.

1204
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,562
>> PROBST: Dave, are you okay

1205
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,231
with this going to a tie?

1206
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,273
>> If I need to go to the

1207
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,818
stones, then I'll go.

1208
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,402
>> PROBST: After 27 days, you

1209
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,320
would draw a stone at chance

1210
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,906
and you're prepared to do that?

1211
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,241
>> You got to be willing to

1212
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,909
make big moves in this game in

1213
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:20,284
order to win.

1214
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,080
I'd say there's nothing bigger

1215
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,915
than lady luck.

1216
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,416
>> PROBST: I always love it

1217
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,544
when it gets to the vote, but

1218
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,379
tonight I am especially curious

1219
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,839
how it's gonna go.

1220
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,631
Mick, you have individual

1221
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:33,881
immunity.

1222
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,299
I can't imagine you're giving

1223
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,217
it up tonight.

1224
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,968
>> Nope.

1225
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,177
>> PROBST: Cannot vote for Mick.

1226
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,720
Everybody else is fair game.

1227
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,055
It's time to vote.

1228
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,557
Brett, you're up.

1229
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,115
>> (whispering): Laura, you are

1230
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,158
a viper, as in poison.

1231
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,161
I pray to God you go tonight.

1232
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:34,942
>> PROBST: I'll go tally

1233
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,944
the votes.

1234
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,037
>> If anybody has the

1235
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,621
hidden immunity idol and you

1236
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,248
want to play it, now would be

1237
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,834
the time to do so.

1238
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,461
Okay.

1239
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,671
Once the votes are read, the

1240
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,464

Everybody else will vote.

have been three very surprising

Tribal Councils.

00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,707
Stay tuned for scenes from our

1324
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,834
next episode.

1325
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:47,796
>> PROBST: Next time

1326
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,505
on <i>Survivor:</i>

1327
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:48,923
>> It's time for me

1328
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,967
for me to create chaos.

1329
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:52,760
(chicken clucking)

1330
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:55,763
>> Shambo is the one leading

1331
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,472
the charge.

1332
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,681
>> Let's just pull the trigger.

1333
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,515
>> I agree.

1334
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,225
>> He's a cancer.

1335
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,684
We have to dump him now.

1336
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,852
>> Sometimes you just have to

1337
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,228
say, "Screw it.

1338
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,479
I'm gonna follow."

1339
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,063
>> So Mick's on aboard with

1340
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,147
the plan.

1341
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,523
>> Yeah, we're all, we're all

1342
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,150
with you, Sham.

1343
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,613
>> I believe that I'm sitting
here tonight for a couple of

1344
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,781
reasons: one, because Shambo
has always had it out for me,

1345
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,951
and, two, I think that I was a
physical threat.

1346
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,994
Clearly, it wasn't a good idea
going into the first two

1347
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,788
individual immunity challenges
and winning them back to back.

1348
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,790
I'm disappointed, but I hope
that Galu sticks together and

1349
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,085
someone from the purple ends up
winning the million dollars.
So, good luck, guys.
