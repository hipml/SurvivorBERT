1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,427
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:08,241
In the Ikabula tribe,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,153
Sunday and Bret were 
numerically dominated by Gen Ys.

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,622
See you, Gen X!

5
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:15,362
In the Vanua tribe,

6
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,686
Zeke was getting closer to Gen X.

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,555
I might have to give up 
the Gen Y tribe.

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,457
In the Takali tribe,

9
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,185
Adam had control

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,362
and he had to decide 
if he voted with the Gen Y couple...

11
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,239
- Shall we take Ken out? 
- Yes.

12
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,408
...or trusted Gen X.

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,004
I will never vote for you.

14
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:38,738
The question is, which camp 
will be the best for my future?

15
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:42,217
At the council,

16
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:46,354
Adam and Gen X 
eliminated Taylor's girlfriend.

17
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:48,657
Figgy, the tribe has spoken.

18
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,086
Good luck, Taylor.

19
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:55,198
There are 14 left.

20
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,388
Who will be eliminated tonight?

21
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,116
Taylor, if you and is disposÃ©...

22
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,460
I would love 
to talk to you face to face.

23
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:20,882
Yeah, I'd love to hear 
your grand plan of...

24
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,095
How do you plan to do now.

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,603
Lord! 
The advice was rubbish.

26
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:27,328
No one from no one.

27
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,565
I can't trust them 
like Figg.

28
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:33,068
The simple comfort of his presence.

29
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,496
The smiles, 
just the good mood on the camp.

30
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:39,464
For me, Figg was the light.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,677
Our camp is greyish now.

32
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,758
For me, it was lose-lose.

33
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:47,933
It seemed the least bad to me.

34
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:49,517
I may have screwed up.

35
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:54,269
- Yeah. And it affects me too. 
- Sure.

36
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,118
Yes, I fucked you.

37
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:59,652
I lied to you and I screwed you.

38
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,133
Clearly.

39
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:03,481
I admit it.

40
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:07,022
I blame myself for ending 
their island romance,

41
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:09,162
but i did 
what i had to do.

42
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:12,098
I put myself 
in a position to progress

43
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,666
with a group of Gen X,

44
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:15,335
and Figgy was

45
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:18,170
ultimately 
the necessary sacrifice.

46
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:22,779
Your position has worsened.

47
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,227
And it's my fault.

48
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,324
I admit it.

49
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,660
I'm beyond pissed off 
with Adam.

50
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,262
Now 
it's about revenge.

51
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,665
For now, I'll keep it cool, 
but when the time comes...

52
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,869
I will destroy you!

53
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:22,769
- Can I take this place? 
- I thought you were sitting here.

54
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:26,178
The rice is excellent this morning.

55
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,409
Very well cooked, as always.

56
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,990
It's easy to put rice 
in the pot.

57
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:35,609
Sitting on the beach of Vanua, 
I reflect.

58
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,358
If we lose the next immunity,

59
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,947
it is clearly Michelle 
that we would eliminate.

60
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:44,954
But I do not exclude 
that Chris tries a bad move

61
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,702
to eliminate me rather than Michelle.

62
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,606
But I believe I have a stronger bond 
with Zeke than with Chris. Frankly,

63
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,512
we are made of the same wood.

64
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:56,829
I'm paranoid, so tell me 
if anyone's coming up behind.

65
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:58,905
- No it's OK. 
- Good.

66
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,268
I tell myself that I could 
show him my idol.

67
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:04,919
It would build a lot of trust.

68
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:09,390
But I hate to 
share this information.

69
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,522
It's a very risky move 
or it's a super move.

70
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:14,120
You can never know.

71
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,448
Zeke, 
I have great faith in you.

72
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:17,818
Me too.

73
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:20,761
I'm going to tell you something 
you don't have to repeat.

74
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,571
- Do you have the idol? 
- I found her the next day.

75
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,996
It's excellent.

76
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:26,774
Great. OK.

77
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,271
- Don't tell anyone. 
- It's not in my interest.

78
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:31,678
I want to go all the way with you, 
hence this confidence.

79
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:33,633
- I appreciate. 
- This is my proof.

80
00:04:33,758 --> 00:04:35,074
David told me

81
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,349
that he had an immunity idol.

82
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:40,011
I was glad to hear it.

83
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:42,145
Because if you don't have one,

84
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,352
it's good that a close person 
has one.

85
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:50,269
You are literally the only one 
besides myself who knows this.

86
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:51,733
Your secret is safe.

87
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,969
David and I could have 
a future together in this game.

88
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,796
He put his life in my hands.

89
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,741
And I will take good care of it.

90
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:01,737
For now.

91
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:17,717
Over here, everyone!

92
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:26,225
Sick stuff!

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,109
Vanua and Ikabula,

94
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,827
discover the new Takali tribe.

95
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:38,514
Figgy was eliminated 
at the last council.

96
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,672
Oh my God!

97
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,680
So many different reactions!

98
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,377
Michaela, 
at the final immunity challenge,

99
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:52,547
you looked at this tribe 
and said,

100
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,347
"You're three Gen Ys. 
Get by or never mind."

101
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:58,508
Sometimes we say what we have to say, 
not what we want to say.

102
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,726
This was the case.

103
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,144
In other words?

104
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,769
Figgy's hour had come 
a long time ago, so...

105
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,279
Taylor, surprised to hear that?

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,430
No comment.

107
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:17,143
Ready for 
today's reward event?

108
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,654
Today,

109
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,125
you will work together 
to unroll and release three balloons.

110
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:29,497
Then you'll throw them in a basket

111
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,791
and push them 
through a rope tunnel.

112
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:34,969
When you have the three, 
you will try to place them

113
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,229
on a perch.

114
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,606
The first two tribes to finish

115
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,008
win the reward. 
Want to know what's at stake?

116
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,244
For the first to finish,

117
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,780
a leader will come to your camp

118
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:48,403
and will cook for you.

119
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,877
You will relax 
while tasting chicken,

120
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,612
garlic prawns,

121
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,020
salads,

122
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,550
and finally, cheesecake.

123
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:00,528
My God!

124
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,654
Not possible!

125
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,279
For the second,

126
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,804
skewers. 
You will have to cook them yourself.

127
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,567
- But it will fill your stomach. 
- Hey, that's it!

128
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:10,872
For the third,

129
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,998
nothing.

130
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,766
Ikabula, you are two more.

131
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:16,674
Who will not take part 
in this event?

132
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,547
- Bret and me. 
- Bret and Sunday are not participating.

133
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,245
Take a seat on the bench. 
The others, a minute of organization

134
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,820
and we're gonna start.

135
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:33,328
Alright, here we go. 
For a reward.

136
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,903
Survivors, ready?

137
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,906
You have to work together 
to release the balloons.

138
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,022
You cannot 
climb on the structure.

139
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,203
Everyone left well.

140
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,142
It's like a spirobol!

141
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,420
Jay is now up

142
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,292
on the shoulders of his comrades,

143
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,991
and it works.

144
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,494
Adam begins to find the rhythm.

145
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,411
- Here! 
- Like that!

146
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:12,200
You have to turn them, 
it takes strength.

147
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,336
- Underneath! 
- Come on, push!

148
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,072
Zeke, in trouble.

149
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:19,674
Big fall for Zeke.

150
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:23,879
Vanua tries something else. 
David is coming up.

151
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,506
Jay is the first 
to release the balloons.

152
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,908
Takali releases them.

153
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,887
David has as much trouble as Zeke.

154
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:34,514
They are rapidly losing ground.

155
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,618
Now you have to undo the knots 
to release your balloons.

156
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,460
They are finally there!

157
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,200
Forward, David, give it your all!

158
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,469
Ikabula is in the lead

159
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,795
from the beginning.

160
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,096
Vanua arrives.

161
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:53,299
Go ahead, untie the knots, 
free the balloons!

162
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:56,800
Jay tire pour Ikabula.

163
00:08:57,993 --> 00:08:59,937
Ken shoots now.

164
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:03,319
Ken scores the first point 
for Takali!

165
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:08,256
Now Jessica and Adam 
get the ball across the net.

166
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,127
You can't shoot again 
until the ball is passed.

167
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,387
Ikabula, still on the first.

168
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,722
Give me another!

169
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,358
Vanua released its balloons. 
Chris shoots.

170
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,139
Chris scores for Vanua.

171
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:21,697
They close the gap.

172
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,663
Now 
Zeke and Michelle are working

173
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:25,265
to release the ball.

174
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:31,746
It's up to Will and Hannah 
to move the ball forward.

175
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:35,850
Michelle and Zeke 
quickly regained ground.

176
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,212
Chris shoots again.

177
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:41,189
Its good. 
It increases the advance

178
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,315
of Vanua.

179
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:44,463
Go, Takali!

180
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:49,297
Ken shoots again 
and scores on the first shot.

181
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:52,616
Zeke and Michelle 
found the system.

182
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,461
They progress very quickly.

183
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,278
Go, Chris!

184
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:58,406
Vanua leads once again.

185
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,945
And two!

186
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,246
Type in!

187
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,772
Go, Takali!

188
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:10,310
Ken, for the third. 
Just too short.

189
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:14,556
Chris scores again.

190
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:16,958
This is the third ball for Vanua.

191
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:20,820
When it is released, 
move on to the 3rd and final step.

192
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,767
Ken scores with the third 
and final ball for Takali.

193
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,727
Go, Vanua!

194
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:32,357
What have Michelle and Zeke figured out 
that no one else has figured out?

195
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,434
Because that is the difference 
in this event.

196
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:37,244
Chris is going to shoot for Vanua.

197
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:41,683
You have to place all three balls 
on the perch to win.

198
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,777
Ikabula is still 
on the second ball.

199
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:47,981
Far behind.

200
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,184
Chris places first for Vanua.

201
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,819
There you go!

202
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,120
Go, Takali!

203
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:58,600
Will and Hannah passed 
their second ball.

204
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,201
Chris places his second.

205
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,670
More than one!

206
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:06,933
Jay scores with the third 
and final ball for Ikabula.

207
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,249
Chris, it's back.

208
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,107
Ken places his first.

209
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,751
Chris is close.

210
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,554
Chris could win now.

211
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,680
And he does!

212
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,676
Huge reward for Vanua!

213
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,359
A chef on the camp!

214
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,828
Ken tries to finish second 
for Takali.

215
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,765
And Will and Hannah 
are still on that ball.

216
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,509
This is Jay and Michaela.

217
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:35,662
Can they get back in the game?

218
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:38,064
Michaela shoots for Ikabula.

219
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,176
Ken tries to place his second.

220
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:45,280
Michaela is trying to catch up on 
a huge backlog.

221
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:49,042
Michaela places her first, tie!

222
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,419
That would be a huge lift

223
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,580
for Ikabula if they succeeded

224
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:55,690
and won the skewers.

225
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,853
Ken places his second for Takali.

226
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,196
He only has one left.

227
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,823
Don't shoot the others!

228
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,282
Here, take your time.

229
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,028
Michaela places her second.

230
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:09,883
Equality, everything is at stake here!

231
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:11,458
More than a ball!

232
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,551
Ken versus Michaela.

233
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,136
Michaela succeeds

234
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:17,612
for Ikabula!

235
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,790
A huge comeback 
to victory!

236
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,198
We have skewers! 
We eat!

237
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:24,992
- Let's eat! 
- Let's eat, friends!

238
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:27,422
Vanua. 
Nice reward.

239
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,991
Full of prepared food, 
fill your belly!

240
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,439
Enjoy! Take your things, 
return to camp.

241
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:34,462
- Thanks! 
- Good afternoon.

242
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,766
Michaela, once again, 
a show of strength.

243
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:40,001
Nice victory for Ikabula.

244
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,179
Come get your skewers. 
Good afternoon.

245
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,476
I hope you have a fire 
to cook them.

246
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:45,701
Thanks, Jeff.

247
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:53,048
Takali, I have nothing for you.

248
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,186
Take your things, 
return to camp.

249
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:58,887
Going from first to last 
to first again,

250
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,615
and take second place...

251
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,385
On the one hand, I'm happy, 
because we have skewers.

252
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,752
But on the other, I'm nervous 
to have helped in the victory,

253
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:10,156
because I don't want 
people to think

254
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,125
that I am the one to beat.

255
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,606
Open!

256
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:28,583
- Bula! 
- Bula!

257
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:30,886
God's goodness!

258
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:33,255
Return to Camp

259
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,348
after winning and seeing

260
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:38,970
the chef with the barbecue, 
the grills and all the trimmings,

261
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,961
it was a huge relief.

262
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,267
The prawns 
have just been caught.

263
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,935
It's fantastic!

264
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,495
Jeff was off the mark.

265
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,165
This is the kind of food 
I imagine in an LA restaurant.

266
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:54,831
- I do not stop. 
- Cheer.

267
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:57,312
This game requires 
change and adaptation.

268
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,806
I was on a diet 
for most of my youth.

269
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:02,942
So I always watch 
what I eat. But here,

270
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:04,486
I fill my plate,

271
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:07,390
I shove it in my mouth 
and I don't stop.

272
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:11,341
Because the more calories I ingest, 
the more it will benefit me.

273
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,328
And because 
of the small fat that is in me,

274
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,221
I could stuff myself.

275
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,399
Zeke doesn't do things by halves.

276
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,924
I'm taking a break.

277
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,458
I have never eaten so much 
so fast in my entire life.

278
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,763
The three guys

279
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:27,542
we have become animals, 
scraping the food off the plate.

280
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,279
Michelle used her cutlery, 
like a human.

281
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,815
It has to come out!

282
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,510
It frees up space for food.

283
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,484
Just hiccups, no worries.

284
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,686
At the end of the meal, 
all I hear,

285
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:50,724
it's bodily functions 
and noises coming from guys.

286
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,659
It got gross and annoying.

287
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:55,061
I don't eat like that.

288
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,606
My mother taught me manners.

289
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,842
But now 
I'm a little nervous,

290
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,302
because being the only girl,

291
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:04,207
I could be an easy vote.

292
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:06,698
But I will not change 
who I am for the game.

293
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,016
Everything in our daily life

294
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:19,152
is affected by the policy.

295
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:20,877
The policy is created

296
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,256
by those who govern, 
whether they are elected or not.

297
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,361
I noticed that a lot of people

298
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:30,212
of my generation don't care.

299
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:32,499
I hate talking politics.

300
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:36,444
Whatever we do, 
there will always be unhappy people.

301
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,206
Who will be president 
does not interest me.

302
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:43,051
I don't want to pin my hopes 
on politics.

303
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,320
I think my generation

304
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,516
will change things drastically.

305
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:50,432
Things we've done

306
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:54,641
that they are no longer useful, 
like the electoral vote.

307
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,265
Taylor is the typical Gen Y.

308
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,140
He is completely honest 
in his answers.

309
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,962
He is not always 
bright with intelligence,

310
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,966
but we still love it,

311
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:08,479
because he will give you his true answer.

312
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:10,178
Let me ask you a question.

313
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,439
Did Adam promise 
you and Figgy

314
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:15,665
- not to vote for you? 
- Oh yeah.

315
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:19,905
I know you will do 
what you have to do,

316
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:23,255
but when the fusion comes, 
I will have no allegiance.

317
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,514
I can shake your hand 
and swear not to vote for you.

318
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,851
- I will not do it. 
- It's good to know!

319
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:31,599
I will never write "Jessica",

320
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,083
I won't write "Ken" anymore.

321
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:38,224
Thanks. I appreciate it, 
it means a lot.

322
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,769
Taylor wouldn't understand the strategy 
even if it was explained to him.

323
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:47,507
So his words are perhaps 
more reliable than those of Adam,

324
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,232
who is more of a strategist.

325
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:54,793
Ken and I soak up all the info 
we're given.

326
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:57,492
If we don't win, 
it will be a very big decision.

327
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,226
And we have to take the right one.

328
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:20,992
Fireworks!

329
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:23,251
- On the 20th day, friends! 
- The 20th day!

330
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,611
We've done half!

331
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:27,473
It was a bug party 
tonight!

332
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:29,949
- Horrible. 
- I just thought, "Michaela,

333
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:32,333
you don't feel anything crawling on you.

334
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,058
It's your imagination.

335
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,625
This fly buzzes, 
but it does not sting.

336
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,184
Let it buzz, Michaela!"

337
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,328
I have been on this island 
for 20 days.

338
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:43,830
I'm halfway there.

339
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,666
But I am strong, 
the strongest of the tribe.

340
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,418
"It doesn't itch, 
it's in your head, girl!"

341
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,066
I know I take things 
very seriously.

342
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:56,718
Just like Steve Jobs was, so 
is Michael Jordan.

343
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,016
Michaela Bradshaw 
takes things to heart.

344
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:01,473
That's what makes us 
winners.

345
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:05,060
If you can't keep up, 
step aside!

346
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,733
How's yours, Sunday?

347
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,822
Pumped up for today?

348
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:12,062
Good.

349
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,703
We try to preserve 
our sense of unity,

350
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,108
to keep winning.

351
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:19,413
Of course, it's a kind of mirage,

352
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,678
because there are four Gen Y 
and two Gen X.

353
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,318
Sunday is super nice.

354
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:28,345
My aunt calls me "Sunny". 
She alone has the right.

355
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,286
But Bret is suspect to me.

356
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,054
What is your job?

357
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,857
Owner of a 
funeral home.

358
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:38,818
I strive 
to comfort families.

359
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,321
I want to raise 
doubts about Bret,

360
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:44,199
because i think he is lying

361
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,970
about funeral directors.

362
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:48,167
I help them choose a coffin, 
all that.

363
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,546
Nothing in particular.

364
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,264
Was it moving at first?

365
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:52,390
Yes very.

366
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:54,576
But it's like everything, you get used to it.

367
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,145
It's a bit morbid, but...

368
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,271
I was calm, cushy, and Hannah 
asks me about my business.

369
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:02,776
I gave her the answers 
she seemed to expect.

370
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:05,854
Do you see one family at a time? 
How it works?

371
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,681
We make an appointment, we see each other

372
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:10,135
and arrange the funeral.

373
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:13,862
I don't like lying to him, 
but I know the story of Survivor.

374
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,922
The police 
rarely do well.

375
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,947
So I won't give up.

376
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:19,833
Can I say something about Bret?

377
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,286
I'm 70% sure he's a cop.

378
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:28,176
He grew up in Boston. 
I'm pretty sure he's a cop.

379
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,618
I think 
I just interviewed a cop.

380
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:32,806
Bret talks like a cop, 
walks like a cop.

381
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,081
But above all,

382
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,320
it's about getting 
the other three Gen Y

383
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:40,755
are wary 
of these two so sympathetic Gen X.

384
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:43,516
Because I want us to stay together, 
all four of us.

385
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:46,099
For me, if you had to vote,

386
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:48,794
I'd be like, "Man, 
I'm pretty sure you're a cop.

387
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,633
My vote is based 
on trust and honesty."

388
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:55,608
If he's a cop, let him say 
it when he wants.

389
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,343
Don't force his hand, 
it would be unpleasant.

390
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:00,300
Funeral directors, 
it's so specific

391
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:02,451
that one would not think to doubt it.

392
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,079
That's the thing.

393
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:06,581
I grew up in Boston.

394
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,342
He talks like all the cops 
I've met. It's silly?

395
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,056
I also believe he is a cop.

396
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,943
Bret calls himself 
a funeral director.

397
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:15,415
But the thing is, I know 
the Florida cops.

398
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,975
And frankly, 
if you take the accent away from him,

399
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,235
you put him in a uniform, 
you put him in Florida,

400
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,803
that would be the guy i'm running from

401
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:23,823
when I make a bonfire 
on the beach.

402
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:26,474
Continue your little investigation.

403
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,649
"But what are you doing exactly?"

404
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:33,540
He's too funny and good-natured 
to run funeral parlors.

405
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,244
It's important 
to know if he's a cop,

406
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,937
that would mean he's lying to me.

407
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:57,357
Over here, everyone!

408
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:10,755
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

409
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:13,740
- First, as you know... 
- I know.

410
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:15,212
Thank you, David.

411
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,662
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

412
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:24,758
Today 
you will throw coconuts

413
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,083
in a net.

414
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,629
When the net is heavy enough,

415
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,957
a flag will unfurl, 
revealing numbers.

416
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,897
These numbers will release a key.

417
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:36,827
This key will unlock a slingshot.

418
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:41,855
You will then fire sandbags 
to knock down targets.

419
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:45,312
The first two tribes to finish

420
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,340
gain immunity, 
are shielded from the vote.

421
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:49,007
The losers will go to the council,

422
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:53,153
where someone will be the 7th person 
eliminated from the game.

423
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,155
Ikabula, you are two more. 
Two will not participate.

424
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,140
It was Bret and Sunday 
last time. And today?

425
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:00,357
William and moi.

426
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:02,958
Hannah and Will are not participating. 
Take a seat on the bench.

427
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,766
The others, a minute of organization 
and we begin.

428
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:11,273
Well, on and go.

429
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,166
For immunity. 
Survivors, ready?

430
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:21,174
First step, very simple,

431
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,109
throwing coconuts 
into a net.

432
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:26,479
Ken misses. 
Jay just misses.

433
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:30,665
Chris, right into it!

434
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:33,186
Michaela... hits the mark.

435
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,513
In rainbow.

436
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:36,029
Taylor takes a chance.

437
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,833
Taylor succeeds.

438
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,202
When you have put enough coconuts,

439
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,235
the flag will unfurl.

440
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:48,011
So far, 
it's not as easy as it looks.

441
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:50,391
You have to take the hit. 
Nice shot from Sunday.

442
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,907
David, a bit short.

443
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:55,913
Vanua is struggling a bit.

444
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:57,577
Chris just misses.

445
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:02,380
Adam sets one up for Takali.

446
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:04,005
Nice shot from Jessica.

447
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,795
Takali's net fills up.

448
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,031
Ikabula's net fills up.

449
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:15,770
Ikabula has 
never lost an event yet.

450
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,095
They wouldn't want to 
start today.

451
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:20,741
Michaela succeeds for Ikabula.

452
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,878
You should start 
picking up the pace.

453
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:24,912
- There you have it! 
- Come on, David!

454
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,339
- David finally succeeds. 
- Nice shot.

455
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,747
Adam rocks!

456
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,978
Takali reaches the stadium

457
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:34,603
where one or two more coconuts 
will suffice.

458
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,916
Where is the tipping point?

459
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,961
Everyone is close.

460
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,991
It's good for Takali!

461
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:46,439
Adam will use the numbers 
to try to free the key.

462
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:50,105
He must find the correct combination 
of number pairs.

463
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,931
What is the correct order?

464
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:54,841
It's not good.

465
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,136
A missed opportunity.

466
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,739
Jay shoots and scores. 
Ikabula approaches.

467
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:06,386
Adam tries and finds.

468
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,681
Come on, forward!

469
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:11,326
Adam can now 
unlock the slingshot.

470
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:13,853
Ikabula approaches.

471
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:15,431
Will it go down?

472
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:16,990
That's enough, and that's it!

473
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:18,296
It goes down!

474
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:20,727
Michaela has the numbers, 
she steps forward.

475
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:24,788
Adam unlocked the slingshot.

476
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:28,401
Takali can start 
shooting the bags at the targets.

477
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:30,076
Taylor gives it a shot.

478
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,539
Too left.

479
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,151
Michaela 
is on number pairs.

480
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:38,004
You have to release this key. 
She has it!

481
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,579
Forward, Ikabula!

482
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,590
she will unlock

483
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,883
the fronds.

484
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,420
- Shit! 
- Taylor just misses.

485
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:49,567
Vanua is dead last.

486
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,206
Voici Zeke.

487
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:53,384
Will it be enough?

488
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:54,974
Yes, it goes down!

489
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:58,173
Can they get there? 
Can they go up?

490
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:01,276
Michelle is on the numbers, 
trying to free the key.

491
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,883
It's one of those events 
where you can come back quickly.

492
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:05,511
Pushes you! 
Ok, Go!

493
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,415
- Are you going? 
- No, stick to your decision!

494
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:10,510
Michelle tries to find 
the combination.

495
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:11,943
What is the correct order?

496
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:13,921
It's not that!

497
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:20,185
Just too short! 
Ken shoots now.

498
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,001
He just misses.

499
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:25,673
Michelle tries another combination.

500
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:27,592
It's not that. 
Try another!

501
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:30,872
There are six combinations.

502
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,365
You have to try them all

503
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,640
to find.

504
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:38,503
Ken tire

505
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:40,539
and knocks down a first target 
for Takali.

506
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:44,976
Michaela fails 
to hit a target,

507
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:46,987
which leaves a chance

508
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,146
in Vanua.

509
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,350
Want to change?

510
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:54,095
- Nope! 
- OK.

511
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,325
Ken takes down a second target.

512
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:01,948
- Two for Takali. 
- Alright, come on, someone!

513
00:26:02,073 --> 00:26:03,479
- Go ahead, Jay! 
- This is Jay.

514
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:04,698
I have tried everything!

515
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:06,265
I think she's cracking up.

516
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,493
Michelle finally succeeds

517
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,404
after a long time.

518
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:16,618
Taylor shoots down a third.

519
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,078
Three for Takali.

520
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,040
Ikabula ...

521
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,518
Always nothing. 
Vanua tries to score.

522
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,391
...and hits a first target 
for Vanua.

523
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:33,234
The Vanua were dead last

524
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,159
and here they are in the shot.

525
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:38,198
Jay scores for Ikabula.

526
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,776
Ken scores for Takali.

527
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,443
That's four for Takali,

528
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,938
one for Vanua and for Ikabula.

529
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,674
Let them fly, Chris!

530
00:26:48,313 --> 00:26:50,450
More than a target for Takali,

531
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,678
for immunity.

532
00:26:51,803 --> 00:26:53,688
Ken could do it 
right now.

533
00:26:58,209 --> 00:26:59,379
And he does!

534
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:02,163
Ken wins immunity for Takali.

535
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,949
No advice.

536
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,725
He remains in second place.

537
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:08,461
- Go on, Zeke! 
- Go on, Zeke!

538
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:09,871
Huge challenge.

539
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:12,321
Nobody wants to go to the council.

540
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,040
Zeke brand for Vanua.

541
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,693
That's two targets for Vanua,

542
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:17,070
one for Ikabula.

543
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:18,236
Here is Bret.

544
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,449
And he succeeds!

545
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:24,719
Both Ikabula and Vanua have 
only three targets left.

546
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:25,845
This is Jay.

547
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,837
Jay just misses.

548
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,012
Chris is back for Vanua.

549
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,689
Right in the target!

550
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:37,198
Vanua took the lead,

551
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,744
more than two targets.

552
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:41,179
- We're changing, I'm exhausted. 
- Come on, Michaela!

553
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:43,028
It's Michaela and Chris now.

554
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:46,141
Chris aims... and succeeds again!

555
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,674
Chris touches another.

556
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,522
Michaela knows no defeat 
with this tribe.

557
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:52,803
It would be a bad time 
to start.

558
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,742
- Completely failed. 
- She was almost there.

559
00:27:56,395 --> 00:27:59,701
Chris, for the win. 
He would send Ikabula to the council.

560
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:00,912
It's okay, Chris!

561
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,804
Chris shoots deep.

562
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:05,227
And he succeeds!

563
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,195
Vanua wins immunity

564
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,595
and send Ikabula

565
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,789
to the board for the first time!

566
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:18,832
Takali.

567
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,367
Good game.

568
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:23,156
No one will leave this tribe.

569
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:27,640
Vanua.

570
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:28,865
Good job.

571
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:31,292
No one will leave Vanua.

572
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,714
Takali, congratulations, 
enjoy your free evening.

573
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,448
This tribe remains intact. 
Pack your things, head back to camp.

574
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:37,723
Thanks, Jeff!

575
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:41,162
Vanua, nice comeback. 
No one will leave tonight.

576
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:44,164
- Take your things, go back to the camp. 
- Thank you, Jeff!

577
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,281
Sunday you will return to camp.

578
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:50,430
Will it be 
seconds or minutes

579
00:28:50,555 --> 00:28:53,900
before the paranoia sets 
in and the shenanigans begin?

580
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,803
I would say minutes, 
because we will try to play it cool

581
00:28:56,928 --> 00:28:58,847
for a few seconds, 
and then

582
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:01,283
after a few minutes, 
we will press the "parano" button.

583
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:03,083
Good, Ikabula.

584
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,288
Advice tonight. Someone 
will be the 7th person eliminated.

585
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,439
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

586
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:11,986
Of course, 
the Gen Y must meet

587
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:13,586
and decide if it will be Bret

588
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,163
or if it will be Sunday.

589
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,325
But as Bret continues to lie,

590
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,225
sorry, Bret, 
but you have to go.

591
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,176
This defeat was 
like a punch in the stomach.

592
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:48,196
We sat in silence

593
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:49,804
at least half an hour,

594
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:52,025
because we really 
like each other.

595
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,869
Bret and I looked at each other.

596
00:29:59,994 --> 00:30:02,044
"Damn, it's one of us."

597
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:04,144
I had to hold back my tears,

598
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:08,540
because I'm not used 
to others deciding my fate.

599
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:11,244
But this is Survivor. 
And we both know it.

600
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:15,988
Sorry.

601
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:27,860
You know what that means, right?

602
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:30,585
You will have to vote for me 
and me for you.

603
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:34,357
- Unless we find another plan. 
- I say.

604
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:37,927
Even if we don't want to.

605
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:40,744
Sunday and I said to each other, 
"I won't vote for you."

606
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:41,908
But, tonight,

607
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,519
we'll have to break that promise. 
And she agreed.

608
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:47,121
It sucks, 'cause if you vote 
for someone else and survive,

609
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,230
- they will come after you. 
- I know, yeah.

610
00:30:49,355 --> 00:30:51,226
We must do so. 
I hate this.

611
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,352
Me too.

612
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:56,045
It sucks not being in control 
of your destiny. But that's the game.

613
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,731
There are times 
when we are at the mercy of others.

614
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,760
But this is Survivor, 
you never know what will happen.

615
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:09,005
I played out a scenario 
in my head.

616
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,272
Here is our final square.

617
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:13,105
That's the other tribes.

618
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,110
Two Gen Y.

619
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:16,563
Two Gen X.

620
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:19,694
And that is the person 
who will survive the vote.

621
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:22,882
I'll show you why, 
it doesn't matter who we keep.

622
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,893
We still have four votes.

623
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:27,907
So one of those people is leaving. 
I say, a Gen X.

624
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:31,392
And so, we meet again.

625
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,501
I gathered Gen Y

626
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:36,661
and I used pebbles and shells 
to lay out a plan,

627
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:40,648
show that in fact, no matter

628
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:43,136
who stays and who goes

629
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:45,513
if we play correctly 
with the numbers.

630
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:48,808
Who do you want to vote for tonight?

631
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:50,477
Bret might be a cop.

632
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:51,669
Maybe.

633
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:56,850
We could split the votes, 
whenever an idol is played.

634
00:31:56,975 --> 00:32:00,896
Alright, we split the first time 
and we all vote Bret the second time around.

635
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,351
This plan to divide the votes,

636
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,448
this is in case 
an idol is played.

637
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:09,004
So the girls will vote Bret 
and the boys Sunday.

638
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:11,071
It will create a tie.

639
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:15,329
So we'll vote again, 
for Bret if all goes well.

640
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,404
We are the four shells.

641
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,007
As long as they remain 
shells...

642
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:22,260
- Everything is fine. 
- ...we're quiet.

643
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:25,412
Michaela has seashells, 
like a soccer game plan.

644
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:27,322
She said, "Well, after the merger,

645
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,357
that person is eliminated.

646
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:32,131
There will be four shells left. 
It's us."

647
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,064
And... Michaela is intelligent.

648
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,665
This is the problem.

649
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,801
We need not fear the council.

650
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:42,202
Going there more often than others 
is the only way to win.

651
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,666
We develop trust.

652
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:46,341
Yeah. That's why 
I love this tribe.

653
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,405
Because I believe I can 
trust you.

654
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,787
And I doubt there are three other 
people I can trust.

655
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:55,383
She is very dangerous. 
She is good in trials,

656
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:56,910
she is smart,

657
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,035
then I had a revelation,

658
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:01,765
"Michaela should go!

659
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,350
Before the merger!"

660
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,589
I'm starting to think about it.

661
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:09,856
How about we take out Michaela?

662
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:11,691
She's wickedly smart.

663
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,428
She will take people out 
one after another.

664
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:18,864
I barely remember people, 
and her, it's like,

665
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:22,478
"This person, and this one, 
two Gen X, one Gen Y..."

666
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:26,114
And I'm like, 
"You're seeing way too far!"

667
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:28,632
Michaela is super intelligent.

668
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,585
Every time 
I chat with her

669
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,997
about the game,

670
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:33,564
she thinks about it methodically.

671
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,941
I just have to wait for the right moment 
to eliminate it.

672
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:37,988
Because I really appreciate it.

673
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:40,900
It emits positive vibrations.

674
00:33:41,025 --> 00:33:43,198
I don't think any of us 
want her to leave.

675
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:46,078
I play devil's advocate. 
She knows we have the idol.

676
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:47,502
It's scary too.

677
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:49,070
You are not wrong.

678
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,864
Bret and Sunday will vote Michaela.

679
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,700
If we tell her, she'll freak out.

680
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,871
If we don't tell her, 
she'll freak out later.

681
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,526
I'd rather not tell him.

682
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:59,546
The thing 
is, I trust her.

683
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,149
She never lied.

684
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:03,076
We are his only allies.

685
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:05,611
Damn, what a vote tonight!

686
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,590
I am nervous.

687
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,785
Michaela is a great ally 
and I've been with her since the beginning.

688
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:14,093
And I still don't 
trust Bret.

689
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,987
It's crazy, 
when you make a big hit,

690
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:18,315
one wonders, 
"Is this the logical thing to do?"

691
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,916
Survivor is no joke.

692
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,598
This decision could shape 
the rest of my game,

693
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,782
to victory 
or defeat.

694
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:25,957
I'm freaking out!

695
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:47,596
So, Ikabula.

696
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:49,195
First time on the board.

697
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,191
The other two tribes 
came here,

698
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:53,927
and in both cases 
the majority eliminated

699
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,302
one of his.

700
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:59,607
Michaela, seeing this, 
how much do you trust Gen Y?

701
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:02,744
Tonight, I'm thinking of the people 
I'm with.

702
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:05,269
The majorities of the other two tribes

703
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,182
were full of shady people.

704
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:09,209
Shady people are unreliable.

705
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:11,987
But what 's great 
about Ikabula,

706
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,656
it's that all six of 
us are pretty reliable.

707
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,416
Jay, were you surprised

708
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:20,495
that the majorities of the other tribes 
eliminate one of their own?

709
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,852
Yeah, clear.

710
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:25,925
Seeing Gen Y release a Gen Y, 
we say to ourselves, "What are you doing?"

711
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,670
And where Gen X were in the majority, 
they did the same.

712
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:29,989
That's crazy.

713
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,259
Sunday, to the test, I said,

714
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:34,374
"How long 
until the shenanigans?"

715
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,443
And you said, 
"About two minutes."

716
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,503
- Did you get it right? 
- Actually no.

717
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:40,407
We came home and sat down,

718
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:43,182
all aligned on a trunk,

719
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,878
without saying a word.

720
00:35:45,003 --> 00:35:46,988
- Even Michaela? 
- Even Michaela!

721
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:51,793
So, Michaela, the six of you were 
sitting on a trunk.

722
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,286
What were you thinking?

723
00:35:55,222 --> 00:36:00,168
To the fact that it sucks 
that our six has to become five.

724
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:03,271
We really like each other.

725
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:05,265
They are Tonton Bret 
and Maman Sunday.

726
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,973
We are near.

727
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,666
We would have taken control of the game

728
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,070
if you had let us 
go to the merger together.

729
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:13,271
It's always my fault!

730
00:36:13,396 --> 00:36:14,397
But yes!

731
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:16,743
We didn't ask for a slingshot!

732
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:20,355
Sunday, does 
it play against you

733
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,321
that the four Gen Y can say,

734
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,954
"It's not that we don't trust 
Sunday or Bret,

735
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,527
it's because they know people 
we don't know.

736
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,589
These four 
I can trust.

737
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:31,866
- We've been together since the beginning." 
- Absolutely.

738
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:34,861
Bret and I know very well 
that we are in the minority.

739
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:38,139
They did everything 
so that we didn't feel left out,

740
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,964
but, you know... 
It's still 4 - 2.

741
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,129
Bret, if there is any positive,

742
00:36:43,254 --> 00:36:45,505
is that the other two tribes 
had a majority

743
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,482
who eliminated one of his own.

744
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:50,783
You're probably thinking, 
"I could cause this tonight!"

745
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:53,755
Hey, I'm open to anything, 
Jeff, let's go!

746
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:56,605
But... They know who I am.

747
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,596
They know what kind of person 
I am, that I'm honest with them.

748
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:01,388
So if anything can help me,

749
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:02,563
let's do it.

750
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:05,700
Will, when you watch 
the evolution of the game,

751
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:09,367
since the time of your birth, 
and the importance of trust,

752
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:10,570
Is it possible

753
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,400
that the strategy has surpassed it

754
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:15,066
and that it is only 
temporary alliances and devoted blocs?

755
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,535
"And I don't care if I eliminate 
anyone by surprise,

756
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,015
because I play as a sniper."

757
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:23,505
You're describing a game 
Ã  la Tony Vlachos.

758
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,485
It's dangerous.

759
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,789
People see 
if you play crazy

760
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,364
full balloons.

761
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,749
And in a game where trust

762
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,606
is a precious rarity,

763
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:36,923
every time you find it, 
you have to hang on to it.

764
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:40,160
Because that's what could 
take you all the way.

765
00:37:40,285 --> 00:37:42,295
Jay, is it played 
on instinct,

766
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,250
Bret versus Sunday?

767
00:37:44,505 --> 00:37:46,900
Yeah. 
You have to follow your instincts.

768
00:37:47,025 --> 00:37:50,537
If he tells you one thing, 
trust him.

769
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:53,365
'Cause that's all you got, 
frankly.

770
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:56,376
What is it based 
on for you?

771
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,267
The merger is probably near.

772
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:00,622
It depends on who, in our opinion,

773
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:03,692
can go all the way to the final quintet 
with us.

774
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,310
So, Will, predict the future.

775
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:08,488
After the vote, 
you return to camp.

776
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:10,713
What kind of tribe will you have?

777
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,470
Five solid and reliable people 
to progress in the game.

778
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:16,992
Jay, are you okay?

779
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:19,899
Will this vote 
actually strengthen the tribe?

780
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:22,769
If I could predict the future, 
Jeff, I believe it,

781
00:38:22,894 --> 00:38:25,944
because then the bonds 
will only get stronger.

782
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:28,717
Michaela. After this vote,

783
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:31,277
will this tribe 
be broken or strengthened?

784
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,027
Clearly reinforced.

785
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:36,549
But I hope that tonight 
no one feels like they're at the bottom of the ladder.

786
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:39,724
We hadn't planned that, 
but it's part of the game.

787
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:41,621
Who would feel 
at the bottom of the ladder?

788
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:44,858
The one of these two great people 
who will remain.

789
00:38:46,154 --> 00:38:48,100
But that's not what I want.

790
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:53,331
So based on what I'm hearing,

791
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,468
we have a group 
that trusts each other,

792
00:38:55,593 --> 00:38:58,138
or someone 
will be taken out by surprise.

793
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:00,273
It's time to vote.

794
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:01,648
Hannah, over to you.

795
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:10,428
As always, I'm shaking.

796
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:12,350
I hope 
people will keep their word.

797
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,973
I wish I 
could have gone further with you.

798
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:40,613
I will count the votes.

799
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:51,558
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

800
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:53,259
now is the time to do it.

801
00:39:57,384 --> 00:39:59,599
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

802
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:02,369
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

803
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:03,770
I will read the votes.

804
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:13,613
Breth. 
Two Bret votes.

805
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:21,129
Michaela. 
Two Bret votes, one Michaela vote.

806
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,468
Michaela. 
Two votes Bret,

807
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:27,994
two votes Michaela.

808
00:40:31,505 --> 00:40:32,977
- Michaela. 
- What?!

809
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,769
That's three votes Michaela, 
two votes Bret,

810
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,003
one vote remains.

811
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:39,906
- You did that? 
- Yeah.

812
00:40:41,393 --> 00:40:42,543
I did it.

813
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:48,682
- Sorry. 
- I didn't do that.

814
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:55,622
Seventh person eliminated...

815
00:40:55,932 --> 00:40:57,864
Michaela. 
Bring me your torch.

816
00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:05,088
You fucked up.

817
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,200
What...?

818
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,932
Michaela, the tribe has spoken.

819
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,397
You will feel good with.

820
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,317
My shoes.

821
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:28,488
Merde, Jay!

822
00:41:29,702 --> 00:41:31,524
You screwed up a good thing, bro.

823
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,715
Well, it was going to be "trust" 
or "surprise elimination."

824
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,252
It turns out that the one 
who preached the most trust

825
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,296
is the one 
that was eliminated by surprise.

826
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:54,845
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

827
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:11,873
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

828
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,143
Next time in Survivor...

829
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,214
The merger has arrived.

830
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:20,473
Fusion!

831
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:23,641
This is where I really start 
destroying people's dreams and hopes.

832
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,376
And the Gen X are in the minority.

833
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,888
They are too close.

834
00:42:27,013 --> 00:42:29,624
We have to get Gen Y out 
or we're in trouble.

835
00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:31,554
But Hannah wants revenge.

836
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,627
I can't trust Jay. 
I hope to have my revenge.

837
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,136
I'm pretty pissed off.

838
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:38,887
It's a stupid decision.

839
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:42,682
I was focused on the end, 
I don't even reach the fusion.

840
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:45,218
If Jay had known how to 
control his paranoia,

841
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:47,373
this group of four 
would have gone all the way.

842
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,190
We would have dominated the game together

843
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:51,588
and someone would have walked away 
with the million.

844
00:42:51,713 --> 00:42:54,438
But hey, too bad. 
I will get rich otherwise.
