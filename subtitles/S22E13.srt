1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
Previously on "Survivor":

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,700
the Ometepe six learned

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,030
that once they defeated
the entire enemy tribe,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,200
the battle was only beginning.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,100
Because now they had to face each other.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,010
One of us has to go
to Redemption Island.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,330
So Rob cut deals with everyone.

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,670
We decide who goes when,and that's it.

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,860
Grant thinks it me and him.
Natalie thinks it's me and her.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,470
As long as everybody thinks
they've tthey've got a piece so,

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,900
I'll be all set.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,620
And everyone believed him.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,090
The only person i really,truly
trust out here is Rob.

14
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,190
- Meanwhile,
- **

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,020
Natalie and Ashley were pairing up.

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,940
Natalie and I,we're hanging.

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,020
Phillip thought he was the
best bet to take to the end.

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,690
I made myself the villain
so everyone in my tribe

19
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,950
feels the best chance of
winning against anybody is me.

20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,900
Despite their different strategies,

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,510
they all agreed Andrea
was the biggest threat.

22
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,360
She's one of the strongest
competitors in the game.

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,390
At tribal council,the
tribe banded together

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,190
to blindside the first
member of their alliance.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,720
- Andrea.
- Oh,my god.

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,460
At Redemption Island,Andrea
must face her former ally,Matt,

27
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,460
for a chance to get back in the game.

28
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,260
As for the rest of the Ometepe,

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,400
the easiest vote is done and
there's nowhere left to hide.

30
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,510
<i>mur***</i>

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,700
And then there were five.

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,710
Tribal was enjoyable.
We blindsided Andrea.

33
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,770
- Andrea was pretty confident.
- She had no idea.

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,480
I love blindsides because in an
evil way it's kind of fun to see,

35
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,620
like,their reaction,how
shocked they are,

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,880
and she was definitely
shocked. You could tell.

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,050
Can Natalie and i just say
we're the last girls standing?

38
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,790
Yeah!

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,050
I'm not going to lie,i'm kind
of glad to see Andrea gone.

40
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,880
I just felt like Natalie
and I were always like this,

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,150
and she was always kind of on the outs.

42
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,910
I'll tell you if there's
any plan to vote you out,

43
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,870
and you tell me,and maybe us two.

44
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,020
Yeah.

45
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,280
Love you.

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,500
I'm kind of stuck in a bad situation

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,000
just because Ashley keeps bringing
up "you're looking out for me,

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,680
and I'm looking out for her.

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,780
" I'm leaning towards sticking to Rob

50
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,640
just because,like,he has been
there for me throughout this.

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,990
But so has Ashley.

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,910
Ashley's probably thinking about
a way to turn the vote against me.

60
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,470
I've been fighting 10
years to get to this point.

61
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,420
I'm seven days away.

62
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,080
It might make sense to
get rid of Ashley next.

63
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,540
Things have to go just right.

64
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,440
I've had control in this game.
I just need to keep control.

- Hey,redemption island.

- Hello.
- Hi,guys.

- How are you?

I'm doing great,doing great.

73
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,510
Andrea showed up at the
i-s-l-e of redemption.

74
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,260
I was certainly most hurt by her
considering you're my number one,

75
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,060
i'll take you to the top and
then she writes my name down

76
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,420
because she's scared to make a move.

77
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,370
I am bitter.
It feels so--

78
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,270
- it leaves a bad taste in your mowct.
- It does feel bad,doesn't it?

79
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,810
I know you hate me and every time i
come to duel i give you dirty looks.

80
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,160
I don't give you dirty looks.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,490
I just don't know why you're
giving me big puppy dog eyes.

82
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,700
You hate me and give
me,like,these evil looks.

83
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,110
I don't give you evil looks.

84
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,230
Come on,you voted against me,and
i tried to get you go with them.

85
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,170
You should have been
a little more decisive

86
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,170
because you came in
and were so wishy-washy.

87
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,370
You went up and had a
heart-to-heart with rob.

Is there enough room for four people.

100
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,690
She can sleep on the ground.

101
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,010
We merged. They kept
there team,their tarp.

102
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,520
Now it's good for her to
serve what i had to go through.

103
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,480
It's sparse living here
at redemption island.

104
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,510
I'd invite her to my house and i
wouldn't let her sleep on the ground.

105
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,420
I'd have something for
her to get off the ground.

106
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,150
She's not at my house.
She's at redemption island.

107
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,520
It's payback. It's a game.

108
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,770

paper. He wiped his ass.

Matt,mike,ralph,and andrea.

113
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,550
Welcome to redemption island arena.

114
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,120
Andrea,first chance to look at the five

115
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,360
who blindsided you at
the last tribal council.

116
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,050
Game changed suddenly for you.

117
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,220
Year,it's just amazing
to me that you can,

118
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,470
like,look into people's eyes
and they can,like,all lie to you.

119
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,300
I think every one of them lied to me.

120
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,730
It's really,like,shocking
and a humbling experience.

121
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,970
- You seem emotional right now.
- A little bit.

122
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,310
Do you feel betrayed?

123
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,550
Yeah,i just-- like i really--
like i really trusted people.

124
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,510
I,like,open up to people and
they tell you,and they're like--

125
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,160
trusting you.

126
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,520
Well,the good news is,that all
four of are you still in this game,

127
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,460
and one person at some point in the
game is going to go back into the game

128
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,510
and will still have a shot
at the million dollars.

129
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,770
To get there,you have
to survive today's duel.

130
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,090
Here's how the duel works.

131
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,160
You're going to move a handle
through a long table maze.

132
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,670
When you get to the end of the maze,

133
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,040
you're going to use the
handle to smash a box.

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,140
You'll retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces
and use them to solve the puzzle.

135
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,070
The first three to complete their
puzzle stay alive and are in this game.

136
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,240
The loser is out,will
become a member of the jury.

137
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,630
Once again,it is do or die.
One shot. Take your spots.

138
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,030
All right,put your hand on your handle.

139
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,070
Here we go. Survivors ready?

140
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,030
Go!

141
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,640
Remember,these handles hover.

142
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,960
Just lift it. Let it hover in there.

143
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,500
It's meant to go,it

144
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,250
don't panic. Just lift
it. Let it hover in there.

145
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,210
Ralph with a little bit of a lead now.

146
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,520
Andrea right in it. Mike in it.

147
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,980
You do not want to last this long
in this game and go if home on day 33

148
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,370
because you're in a bad mood.

149
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,660
Ralph making fast work of this
maze,like he made it himself.

150
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,050
Ralph has his mate finished!

151
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,540
He's going to start
working on his puzzle.

152
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,440
Mike doing well. Andrea still in it.

153
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,260
Matt very calm. Not panicked at all.

154
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,800
Ralph getting an early
start on his puzzle.

155
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,690
Ralph does not want to
go home after 33 days.

156
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,730
- Oh,my gosh. Why is it so hard!
- He wants back in this game.

157
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,560
Mike and matt both very calm.

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,210
Their time on redemption
has shown them patience.

159
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,260
I'm,like,all frazzled.

160
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,690
Mike has his maze finished,untying
those puzzle pieces.

161
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,210
Matt is finished now with his maze.

162
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,190
Matt has his bag of puzzle pieces.

163
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,810
Andrea very close.

164
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,950
Andrea has her's finished.

165
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,830
Andrea has her bag of puzzle pieces.

166
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,650
Everybody working on their puzzle now.

167
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,200
Ralph has had a huge head start
but three people are moving on.

168
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,190
You don't have to win this challenge.

169
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,220
You just don't want
to lose this challenge.

170
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,070
Whatever lead ralph had
is quickly evaporating.

171
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,030
Mike doing a nice job on his puzzle.

172
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,290
Matt right behind. Andrea's in this.

173
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,780
Ralph is actually the
one falling behind now.

174
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,430
Mike is very close,but he's
missing one piece. Where is it?

175
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,630
Mike has his puzzle solved.

176
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,790
Step back. Mike is staying alive.

177
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,610
It is now matt,ralph,and andrea.

178
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,190
Two more people are moving on

179
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,980
and staying alive in the
quest for one million dollars.

180
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,980
A million dollars.

181
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,460
You lose this challenge,your
shot at the money is over.

182
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,830
You become a member of
the jury. That blows.

183
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,700
Matt has it right. Andrea has it right.

184
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,460
Matt,mike,and andrea stay alive.

185
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,250
Good job,you buddy.

186
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,330
Ralph,unfortunately,after
33 days in this game,

187
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,910
your shot at the money is over.

188
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,420
You will have a say in
who wins the money,though.

189
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,190
You're going to become the
next member of the jury.

190
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,340
Toss your buff in the urn.
We'll see you at tribal council.

191
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,040
- ***
- **brother.

192
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,090
Matt,mike,andrea,you live to
see another day in this game.

193
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,060
Grab your stuff. Head
back to redemption island,

194
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,290
and await your next
opponent and your next duel.

195
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,970
All right,guys. You
can head back to camp.

196
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,370
I'll never give up exphoap
i'll never give up fight.

197
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,330
I've got more heart than anyone out here

198
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,330
but this redemption island twist is making
it even harder to make it to the end.

199
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,850
I want redemption island
to be over and done with

200
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,270
so it's not a factor anymore.

201
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,740
{a6}<i>mur***</i>

202
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,220
- you hungry,brother?
- Starving.

203
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,380
I think we can make some rice.

204
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,870
If we eat it,it's only
going to take to us day 36

205
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,720
if we eat three times a day.

206
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,060
It's not like all of us are going
to be here. We could have a cup.

207
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,690
Three days from now,you're
going to be less one.

208
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,630
And two days from that,you're
going to be less one.

209
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,410
That's how you should be thinking. It's
not like all of us are going to be here.

210
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,010
I don't know how much,

211
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,330
but i think we definitely
should eat something,don't you?

212
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,390
Okay.

213
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,410
Zapatera ate too much when they were
here and now we don't have much left.

214
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,480
Everybody's exhausted. Ease along.

215
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
Try to not exert as
much energy as we can.

216
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,600
Ashley is the only one that
doesn't want to eat it,right?

217
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,110
I don't know what it is,bro,

218
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,200
but there's something about
her i just don't trust.

219
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,140
Hey,bro,

220
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,630
next immunity challenge,i
say we get rid of ashley.

221
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,170
I'll tell
you what--

222
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,670
natalie will never
switch over after that.

223
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,100
She can't. She'd be too scared.

224
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,450
I say we do it.

225
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,060
Okay,there's a reason why grant's
coming to you. He's a big,muscular guy.

226
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:48,020
And if we want him to dominate,he better
be eating and feeling good and strong.

227
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,160
Oh,i'll give up my portion of rice,then.

228
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,870
Let me give my portion of rice to them.

229
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,520
I'm not asking you to give
up your portion of rice,

230
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,600
but you don't consume as many calories.

231
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,940
You don't need as much food.
You don't need as much energy.

232
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,200
Think about that.

233
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,270
You can not get in our
face and talk to us--

234
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,070
i'm getting ready-- i'm
getting ready to get up.

235
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,540
- Just go,then.
- But do not get in our face and talk to us that way.

236
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,790
- Which way?
- In that tone of voice.

237
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,420
You know what? I'll leave
it. I'm done with it.

238
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,580
That's the biggest
mode i ever heard--

239
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,570
we don't need to eat
because we're girls.

240
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,610
You know what?

241
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,650
We don't need the energy and
we don't need the calories.

242
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,480
Don't lie on me! Don't lie on me!

243
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,060
What are you talking about a lie.

244
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,250
You just said i said you
don't need the energy.

245
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,480
I said you don't need as much
as he does and that's a fact.

246
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,180
I didn't say you don't get to eat.

247
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,130
1700 calories versus 3600.

248
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,460
how do you know
how many calories --

249
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,650
because i'm a well-read
person,that's why.

250
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,060
The average woman can survive
on 1700 calories a day.

251
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,930
Good. Maybe i'm not average.

252
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,230
- Guess what? I don't give a what you are.
- What.

253
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,040
I really don't,i really don't.

254
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,970
I don't give
a-- you are.

255
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,030
I don't give
a-- you are.

256
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,540
We can
tell--

257
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,650
i don't care,i don't care.

258
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,430
I answered your question
and you didn't like it.

259
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,980
You're not prepared to argue
with boston rob about it

260
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,180
but you want to argue with me.

261
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,690
****

262
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,200
With you two it doesn't
become an argument.

263
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,050
Maybe we don't argue with
them because they're normal.

264
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,100
Yeah,they are normal. You
want something from them.

265
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,060
Since day one you snuggled
up real nicely with them.

266
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,570
You want to bring it out,we
can talk about it,okay.

267
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,440
The thing about me,you open up a can of

268
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,970
i can get right in there with
you and drag you down with it.

269
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,930
If that's what you
want to do,let's do it.

270
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,180
- Get out of our faces.
- I don't have to get out of your faces.

271
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,520
I'll sit right up here if i want.

272
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,760
- ***
- ****

273
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,440
- Phillip,come on,dude.
- They piss me off,man.

274
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,160
I did.

275
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
I tried to explain it to both of them.

276
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,570
You explained nothing,phillip.

277
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,160
He's pathetic. And he's crazy.

278
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,460
Not the "n" word crazy. He's just crazy.

279
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,080
Your little princes,go
get on your panellent.

280
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,230
Go get on miss u.S.A.

281
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,590
Ashley and natalie are
getting too close for comfort.

282
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,800
The best thing for me to do
is to split the two of them up.

283
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
What a nut.

284
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,180
Instead of picking on one of
them,he picks on both of them.

285
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,320
Instead of driving those two
apart,he drives them closer together.

286
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,680
Phillip,stop making so much work for me.

287
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,950
- How are you doing?
- Good.

288
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,600
That was crazy. Are you okay?

289
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,710
What are you thinking?

290
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,080
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.

291
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,630
All you have to do is you
just havev to do what i say,

292
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,790
- okay?
- Yeah.

293
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,310
Keep ashley happy.

294
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,120
If you hear her mention
anything about some kind of plan

295
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,360
that doesn't involve getting
phillip out then we need to talk.

296
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,110
I'm for sure that she wants phillip out.

297
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,670
She wants phillip out. I know.

298
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,080
She's freaking out that
you're going to go for her.

299
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,010
Well,we are going to go for her,maybe.

300
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,010
- I don't know.
- Really?

301
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,160
Because grant is very skeptical
about ashley's actions,you know.

302
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,760
And grant wants to get ashley out.

303
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,770
- Okay,well-- - it
doesn't make sense. I know.

304
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,670
But just-- just
trust me this.

305
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,040
Like,i know and ashley have
been friends this whole game.

306
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,950
I promise you i will get you
to the end. I promise you.

307
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,350
Natalie and i,you know,we've
stuck together since the beginning.

308
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,680
And the thing with natalie is
she's really relying on rob a lot.

309
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,590
And i rely on rob,but i also
know that he's playing the game.

310
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,200
And i would bet my life if it
came down to grant,me,natalie,

311
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,630
and rob in the four,that rob would
vote one of us girls out in a heartbeat.

312
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,290
So i think the best
play for me in this game

313
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:38,310
is to just get a big move going here
and get rid of a strong competitor.

314
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,460
We were just thinking that it might
be smarter to send grant to redemption,

315
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,020
and then only one person comes back,

316
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,570
whereas if he's still
here,and mike comes back,

317
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,780
then we've got to worry about
getting rid of mike and him.

318
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,440
You know what i mean?

319
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,710
Do you really want to deal with phillip?

320
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,880
No. I don't want to keep phillip around.

321
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,540
I just want to do what's the
smartest to keep us three together.

322
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,430
It's definitely something to consider.

323
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,190
Let's just sleep on it and
see what happens tomorrow.

324
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,440
Ashley actually came to
me with this genius plan.

325
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,300
Let's get rid of grant next.

326
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,410
I've already run the numbers
on this scenario weeks ago.

327
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,060
It doesn't make sense.

328
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,200
All it does is give
ashley another way closer

329
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,990
to squeezing herself
into the fin finals.

330
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,970
She's no good,bro. She wants you gone.

331
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,020
She wants to throw you under the bus.

332
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,710
She's like,yeah,even if
phillip wins immunity,who cares.

333
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,940
That's a snake,bro.

334
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,490
Grant,i'm not doing it to you.

335
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,380
- I know you're not.
- I told you you have my word.

336
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,510
But we have to win. Me
and you,we have to win.

337
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,690
- Dude,it's done.
- We have to win every one each time out.

338
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,700
*****

339
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,160
Ashley is a dark individual,and she's
ridden on the coattails far enough.

340
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,280
If ashley doesn't win
immunity,she's out of this game,

341
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,490
and i'm going to be
happy to do it,happy.

342
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,570
<i>mur***</i>

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,460
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready,brother.

344
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,530
Okay,good. We're all on board here.

345
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,080
The more than likely scenario
that's going to be happening

346
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,010
is we're sticking
together until the end,

347
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,380
which if you told me that day 19
i would have called you a liar.

348
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,920
- Chopsticks.
- Oh,i hope it's chinese food!

349
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,010
Don't even go there.

350
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,370
Ashley actually came to
me last night and said

351
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,540
that she thinks she wants to
get rid of grant before phillip.

352
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,400
Ashley's had a free ride for 35 days,

353
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,950
and her fairy tale's about to
come to an end real abruptly.

354
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,320
Rise and shine. Tree mail. Tree mail!

355
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,190
You don't have to,like,stand up. But
you can definitely sit up. Here we go.

356
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,360
"so close yet so far to go.

357
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,780
Leaving now would make you sick.

358
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,110
Redemption island gets
you one last chance

359
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,380
but for now you have a bone to pick.

360
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,760
" what does that mean? What is this?

361
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,660
I don't know. I have no idea.

362
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,080
Well,we'll find out soon enough.

363
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,710
I feel like it's pretty
pivotal for me now.

364
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,050
No. Stop.

365
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,450
I'm just saying,natalie.

366
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,940
Last night,natalie and i
approached rob with an idea

367
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,450
that we're going to blindside grant.

368
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,900
And i thought rob would
be like,all about it,

369
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,920
and at first he was kind of hesitant,

370
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,130
and then the more he
thought about it he was like,

371
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,800
that is a really good idea.

372
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,920
So,we'll see.

373
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,700
I kind of feel paranoid,like
if grant wins immunity,

374
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,710
then i might be,like,on
the chopping block.

375
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,890
Rob,thanks for the socks last night.

376
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,760
It seriously saved my life.

377
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,610
But i really trust natalie,and
i think she's 100% on my side.

378
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,900
So if anything's said,nat
he usually lets me know.

379
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,820
This is going to be hard.

380
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,510
It's going to be
hard because she's--

381
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,590
if she just sticks by you all day

382
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,210
i'll just tell you right
before we go,all right.

383
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,010
But whatever you need to know,

384
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,240
just know that i got your
back,natalie,all the way to the end.

385
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,520
All right? I promise you.

386
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,530
I won't do anything that's
going to put you in jeopardy.

387
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,700
I understand it's going to be hard.

388
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,320
But at this point,i can't stand what
she's doing to you. I can see it.

389
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,880
She's trying to tell you
what's in your best interest.

390
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,100
She's coming.

391
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,310
I want to try that peanut butter--
that snickers brownie thing,though.

392
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,600
- I'm,like,seriously going to make that when i go home.
- I know.

393
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,070
But i don't know where--
where do you get caramel sauce?

394
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,570
- Can you buy it?
- Yeah.

395
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,200
- Like,where they have the reese ease shelf stuff.
- Yeah.

396
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,670
Natalie may not be the brightest
player to ever play this game,

397
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,720
we all know that. But
natalie is a sweetheart.

398
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,500
She's innocent and she's pure,and
ashley's trying to corrupt that.

399
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,840
Ashley and natalie,they've been close
since the beginning of this game.

400
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,040
But it's never been
a strategic closeness.

401
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:39,040
And more and more,i see ashley
imposing her wisdom on natalie.

402
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,590
And it's not a good thing.

403
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,550
You know what i'm
exciting abou it's day 35.

404
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,820
and after 35 days of
having this pain in my ass,

405
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,860
i think i'm going to finally
get some relief tonight.

406
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,760
- Are you ready to go?
- I'm going to win.

407
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,290
All right.

408
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,620
Come on in,guys.

409
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,190
- You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
- Yup.

410
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,700
First things first,rob. Once
again,i will take it back.

411
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,630
Once again,immunity
is back up for grabs.

412
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,900
For today's challenge,

413
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,600
you will use large fish hooks to
retrieve bags of puzzle pieces.

414
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,100
You will then use those pieces

415
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,220
to complete a puzzle in the
shape of a fish skeleton.

416
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,830
To make it a little more interesting,

417
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,120
you will do this challenge with
one arm tied behind your back.

418
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,780
First person to get
it right wins immunity.

419
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,690
All five of you are
very close to the money.

420
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,680
With this around your neck,it
ensures you get one step closer.

421
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,910
In addition,today,you
are playing for reward.

422
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,000
It is "suvivor's"
version of room service.

423
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,660
You will have a three-course
meal delivered to you at camp.

424
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,550
- Worth playing for.
- Yeah.

425
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,050
All right,we'll draw for
sports and get started.

426
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,280
Here we go. For immunity
and reward,survivors ready?

427
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,050
Go!

428
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,960
Already difficult having
that one arm behind your back

429
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,940
makes it even more difficult.

430
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,170
Grant makes quick work of that,has
his first bag already. Amazing!

431
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,570
Rob has his bag.

432
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,450
Ashley now back. Phillip back.

433
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,840
Natalie trying to hook
that bag of puzzle pieces.

434
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,670
She's got it. Natalie heads back.

435
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,260
Once you have the pieces free,

436
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,010
start placing them on the
spine of the fish skeleton.

437
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,280
Grant doing a great job.

438
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,520
Phillip now working on his puzzle.

439
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,000
Natalie still trying to get the
pieces out of the bag using her teeth.

440
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,130
The only rule is these fish
bones cannot touch each other.

441
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,290
Ashley very close.
She knocks a piece out.

442
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,850
Grant has his first section
finished. He's back out.

443
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,520
Grant now has to hook four large hooks.

444
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,910
Phillip has his first section done.

445
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,180
Rob has his first section done.

446
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,410
Phillip is the first one to finish.

447
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,040
And it all collapses
before he can get back.

448
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,540
Phillip has to start over.

449
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,440
Natalie still working
on her first section.

450
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,100
Ashley's been on that first
section for a long time.

451
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,910
Finally finishes.

452
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,550
Phillip has his back together.

453
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,380
Rob there. Rob has his together.

454
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,480
Ashley quickly gets her four hooks
and ashley is now back in this.

455
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,110
Rob has all the pieces out
from his second section.

456
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,710
Now grant has it. Grant is now back.

457
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,400
Natalie still inexplicably
working on her first section,

458
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
knocking pieces out.

459
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,060
Rob quick work on the second section.

460
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,560
Ashley has her second section
complete. Ashley now in the lead.

461
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,540
Grant has his second section complete.

462
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,180
Phillip has his second section complete.

463
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,300
Rob now falling behind.

464
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,150
Natalie is still on the first section.

465
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,870
Once again,ashley,the first person
to get all five hooks together

466
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,060
like she grew up doing
it. Ashley now back.

467
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,810
Natalie out of this challenge.

468
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,440
You might as well sit down and watch.

469
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,700
Grant going for that
fifth and final hook.

470
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,740
Ashley's working on that final section.

471
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,060
Rob has his five hooks.
He's heading back.

472
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,500
Grant cannot get that last hook.

473
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,960
Ashley getting closer.
Rob trying to catch her.

474
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,180
Phillip trying to get in on it.

475
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,290
It is ashley and rob right now.

476
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,840
Ashley is close. But
two pieces are touching.

477
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,060
Ashley wins immunity and reward.

478
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,940
Thank god.

479
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,080
All right,ashley,get
over here. Right here.

480
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,120
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

481
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,480
Ashley is safe at
tonight's tribal council.

482
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,890
You cannot be voted out
of this game tonight.

483
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,720
Such huge relief.

484
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,610
In addition to immunity,reward.

485
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,510
Here's how it works.

486
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,990
We have a room service menu,

487
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,000
and as you can see on this
menu,the are spots for two names.

488
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,880
Pick one person,ashley,to join you.

489
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,620
Huge decision for you.

490
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,990
Natalie.

491
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,460
She didn't get the last
reward,chocolate cake,

492
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,720
and i've drawn a lot of
strength from her being out here.

493
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,150
Natalie,come on over.

494
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,420
Thank you,ash!

495
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,720
All right,"survivor" room service
will be deliveredded to your camp

496
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,170
for ashley and natalie.

497
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,930
In addition you have to
figure out who is going home.

498
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,170
It will be either natalie,grant,phillip,

499
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,900
or rob who will be vote out
at tonight's tribal council

500
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,070
and sent to redemption island.

501
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,540
Grab your stuff. Head back to
camp. Be kind to your waiter.

502
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,530
<i>mur***</i>

503
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,990
Ashley!

504
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,730
Days like today,man,i
wish i stayed home.

505
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,940
It just happens,you know,

506
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,250
when there's one thing you
tonight want to happen,it happens.

507
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,580
Ashley!

508
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,350
We can celebrate now! Food!

509
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,820
And then all of a
sudden,ashley's a genius.

510
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,330
This was all her plan all along.

511
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,520
Grant,when you watch this,

512
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,770
you're going to realize i never
wanted to do it this way,bud.

513
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,560
And,although i'd like to,you
know,think of you as a friend,

514
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,200
i department come to
this game to make friends.

515
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,230
I came to this game to win.

516
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,190
So even though it does
break my heart,bud,

517
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,730
i gotta vote your ass off tonight.

518
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,900
The three of us take out
grant. That's it. It's done.

519
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,480
It's done. We don't
need to talk about it.

520
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,220
It's perfect. It's the
perfect time to do it,too.

521
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,030
- Yeah,heenes. I think he knows it's him.
- Yeah.

522
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,330
But his only options are
to either take out phillip

523
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,620
or if he thinks he can get me
and phillip to take out natalie.

524
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,020
- I'm not taking you out.
- Okay.

525
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,910
I'm never going to vote against you.

526
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,200
So i'll go play bad guy.

527
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,620
It seems like no matter what
the situation on "survivor,"

528
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,270
i have to do the dirty work

529
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,380
because everybody else
is too stupid to do it.

530
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,880
Here's the thing,we've got
to go put on an act for grant.

531
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,470
I have to play to grant
is it going to be natalie

532
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,880
or is it going to be shep.

533
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,210
I have to play to grant
we can go to natalie

534
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,270
- and we can go to ashley and try to get you out.
- Right.

535
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,700
I'm not getting you
out. You have my word.

536
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,670
I basically told phillip
saying we voted for grant.

537
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,600
****

538
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,800
Then i had to go to grant,and ask
grant which way he wanted to go,

539
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,650
if he wanted to go with phillip
or he wanted t to go wih natalie.

540
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,130
It's a lot of work. It's exhausting.

541
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,130
Dude,what do you think,brother?

542
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,260
Look,i know you and natalie
have a special relationship

543
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,750
but my word is with you,dude,

544
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,850
and all we need is me,you and
phillip to vote for natalie.

545
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,750
*****

546
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,320
What do you fl most comfortabl
playi? In mhead,it's a no-brner.

547
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,280
- Nalie? -
Yh. And i kno-

548
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,010
- listen,she- - ilmos feel like i can
convin natalie morthan i can convince shep.

549
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,510
- I don't know.
- H,man.

550
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,100
I don't know. Ifshles
in,natalie's there.

551
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,580
I don't kwf she's going to listen toe.
She's going listen to ashley first.

552
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,420
Right,which ihink has already
happened,bro to be honest with you,

553
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,360
it's like a couple,no different.

554
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,560
Spliing them up is going
to be the best route.

555
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:34,110
I promise you this,man,in my gut
feeling,i honestly think shep's wh them.

556
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,270
- And on we roll.
- All right.

557
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,200
- But you're good with that,though?
- That's good,man.

558
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,050
- You're good?
- Yeah.

559
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,290
Cool.

560
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,770
- Blindside.
- Blindside.

561
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,050
Worst-case scenario happened in
the challenge today but it's okay.

562
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,510
We have an escape hatch.

563
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,710
Natalie is going to be
the one going home tonight.

564
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,070
When you look somebody in
the eye and shake their hand,

565
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,480
you kind of get a vibe from that person

566
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,440
and i got a good one from rob
and sticking to our alliance.

567
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,330
It's going to be exciting. You're
going to see my name written down twice,

568
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,820
and then here comes natalie.

569
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,450
The prince cess going to have a red
carpet straight to redemption island.

570
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,470
Really?

571
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,760
Thank you!

572
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,150
Natalie and i were making rice
for the boys,and all of a sudden,

573
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,180
like,these little waiters
show up and they've got,like,

574
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,600
their little bow ties and suits on
and they have our platters of food.

575
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,610
And we were just
like,"see,ya,boys. " we ran off.

576
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,020
But honestly,if there was any
challenge i needed to win,it was today.

577
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,350
So that's why i just feel on
top of the world right now.

578
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,100
I can't wipe the smile off my face.

579
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,740
Grab a spoon. Grab the spoon.

580
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,520
This is what we have been talking about.

581
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,090
Oh,my god!

582
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,180
I'm speechless.

583
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,280
Ashley! Natalie!

584
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,130
This is not even right.

585
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,670
Do you feel okay?

586
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,080
- Thank you. For picking me.
- You're welcome.

587
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,880
- I love you.
- I love you,too.

588
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,060
Eat a lot. Make yourselves sick.

589
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,020
In a good way.

590
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,850
I feel terrible!

591
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,400
I hope you choke on it.

592
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,980
Ashley and natalie are
getting too close for comfort.

593
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,150
It's just like amber and i.

594
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,770
It's just like andrea and matt were
at the beginning of this season.

595
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,790
A couple is very powerful in this game.

596
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:09,060
Even if it's two girls,if they
trust and believe in each other,

597
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,260
it's a very powerful thing.

598
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,270
Person from redemption
comes back and wins,

599
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,080
we might have to team up with them.

600
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,790
Strategy.

601
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,840
Let's just hope the person from
redemption comes back tomorrow,

602
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,660
because if not,rob's going
to want to break us up.

603
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,550
Part of me was hoping that
ashley wouldn't pick me

604
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:37,660
just because it really
put me in a sucky position.

605
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,370
I feel like i'm stuck.

606
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,840
I have ashley on my side,and
i have rob on my side.

607
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:50,470
And it's really tough because
both sides have pros and cons.

608
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,710
What's going on with ash?

609
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,890
She just feels really confident now.

610
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,680
She just feels really confident.

611
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,410
She's,like,totally counting on me.

612
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,200
Right.

613
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,300
She thinks it's me and her.

614
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,560
But at the end of the
day,it's me and you.

615
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,610
- Yes.
- Yeah .

616
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,570
You knew for a while,but i know
ashley can't be trusted,either.

617
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,140
If she turned on grant this
quickly,it will be me next.

618
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,830
I guarantee it.

619
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,740
- I'm not going to lie. Thisucks.
- I know.

620
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,120
With ashley and natalie getting
as close as they're getting,

621
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,830
it could be a real problem

622
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,510
if somebody were to come
back from redemption island,

623
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,630
and they were to decide
to join up with that person

624
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,180
and decide they don't need me anymore.

625
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:50,280
In that situation,it would
be more advantageous for me

626
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,600
to break up ashley and
natalie while i have the chance

627
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,500
so that that doesn't happen.

628
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,260
And i think grant's a good guy.

629
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,710
I really have,like,made a good
friendship with him throughout this show.

630
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,320
I'm still sitting in a pretty good spot,

631
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,450
even though i didn't win immunity today.

632
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,280
If i decide it's going
to be grant,it's grant.

633
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,540
If i decide it's going to be
natalie,it will be natalie.

634
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,230
Oh,it's not that bad!

635
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,620
One man should not have
this much power in this game.

636
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,020
Luckily i'm not an ordinary man.

637
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,030
We'll now bring in the
members of the jury.

638
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:43,640
David,julie,steve,and ralph.

639
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,850
Ashley,35 days in.

640
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,510
Gotta feel pretty good to be
wearg that necklace tonight.

641
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,760
Honestly,i had a weird feeling,

642
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,240
like,if there was one i
needed to win,it was this one.

643
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,080
And i feel really good to be
wearing this necklace,honestly.

644
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,210
It's the one tribal council that i
actually feel safe,and i feel good.

645
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,320
Grant,how badly do you think
you needed to win today.

646
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,600
I think it was pretty
crucial they won today.

647
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,550
I am a threat in challenges.

648
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,650
And without the
necklace,you're a target.

649
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,620
Rob,you're vulnerable tonight.

650
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,040
Yeah. I mean,i definitely
feel vulnerable.

651
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,560
I think maybe the only
thing i have going for me

652
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,880
is that maybe grant's a
bigger threat than me. I hope.

653
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,540
Ashley,you win today,and
you pick natalie.

654
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,220
The only other girl to
join you on the reward.

655
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,570
Did you feel a reaction back at camp

656
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,640
when it was just you and natalie eating?

657
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,140
Natalie's been there
for me this whole time.

658
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,700
And at this point,in the game,

659
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,320
i don't think it's a shock that
natalie and i are very close --

660
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,180
it may not be a shock,but
even hearing you say

661
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,910
that you two are very close,

662
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,360
i'm telling you right now,

663
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,100
bombs are exploding in
grant's,rob's,and phillip's ears.

664
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:04,790
Phillip,do you believe that it means
nothing that ashley picked natalie?

665
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,600
I mean,none of us thought that we
were going to be the one picked.

666
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,230
I mean,we knew that she
was going to pick natalie,

667
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,730
so,is it strategic? Yeah,sure.

668
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,120
So,natalie,then it's
probably a natural assumption

669
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,290
that you and ashley would
vote together as well.

670
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,440
Yeah. I mean,ashley
and i are very close.

671
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,970
So i know that these guys are probably
looking at maybe me as a target

672
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,210
because they might want
to split us up,you know.

673
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,910
They may feel that we're
dangerous in the game.

674
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,900
Grant,clearly,with five people in
the game,two people have votes. Huge.

675
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,470
It's absolutely huge.

676
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,480
But you come here with
a solid group of people,

677
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,180
or maybe even just two,maybe three.

678
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,410
And you've got to put faith that
their word is going to be their bond.

679
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,990
Rob,how much of tonight's vote goes into

680
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:58,570
the category of the person we
vote off is going to redemption?

681
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,330
At this point,you can't
speculate any more.

682
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,050
Nobody knows about redemption.

683
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,760
Nobody knows when it's going to
end. I thought it was over already.

684
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,640
It's still going.

685
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,790
Rob,a few more days left in this game.

686
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,200
What gets you through this?

687
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,090
My wife and my daughter. That's it.

688
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,370
I love my wife more than
anything else in the world.

689
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,330
And she knows how much i love this game.

690
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,320
She's made tremendous sacrifices
to let me come out here

691
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,900
over and over and over
again to try to win.

692
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,990
And we're so close,but,with
all the different scenarios,

693
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,680
we're still so far away.

694
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,530
You can try to do
everything right whole game,

695
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:40,750
and then one little thing here
or there,and poof. It's all gone.

696
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,470
Grant,how about you? What gets
you through these last days?

697
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,620
I think about my soon-to-be
wife,who's waiting at home for me.

698
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,560
It brings me to tears every time,

699
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,060
just having that bond and
that trust with somebody is...

700
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,480
It's a greater gift than
anything you can find out here.

701
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,030
And i just know
i have got that--

702
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,530
that beautiful spirit just
waiting for me back at ho home.

703
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,720
Rob,how big a vote tonight?

704
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,310
It's the biggest vote we've had so far.

705
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:24,710
At this point,everybody's
on edge. I'm on edge.

706
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:29,280
Let's get to the vote. Cannot vote for
ashley. Everybody else is fair game.

707
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,080
It is time to vote. Grant,you're up.

708
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,090
Grant,i think you're too
strong of a competitor

709
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,570
and too much of a threat. Sorry.

710
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,820
I'll go tally the votes.

711
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,140
If anybody has the hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

712
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,630
now would be the time to do so.

713
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,890
Once the votes are
read,the decision is final.

714
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,960
Person voted out will be asked to leave
the tribal council area immediately.

715
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,770
I'll read the votes.

716
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,280
First vote,natalie.

717
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,120
Grant. One vote natalie,one vote grant.

718
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,660
Grant. Two votes grant,one vote natalie.

719
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,990
15th person voted out,grant.

720
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,840
That's three. That's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

721
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,600
Hat have you...

722
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,120
Grant,the tribe has spoken.

723
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,590
Grab your torch. Head
to redemption island.

724
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,970
You'll have a chance to
get back in this game.

725
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,830
See you guys shortly.

726
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,810
Well,there are only four
days left in this game.

727
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,250
But there are still a
lot of things standing

728
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,430
between you and the million dollars.

729
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,310
Perhaps the biggest is the
fact that somebody you voted out

730
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,600
is going to return from redemption
island and re-enter this game.

731
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,470
Grab your torches. Head
back to camp. Good night.

735
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,600
Next time on The special
two-hour season finale,

736
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,670
everyone has a plan to win it all.

737
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,180
- It's the three of us till the end.
- Promise you.

738
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,750
But someone will return
from redemption island.

739
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,380
****

740
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,500
And it puts everybody in jeopardy.

741
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,600
Pretty big stakes.

742
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,730
All good things must come to an end.

743
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,090
Sunday,may 15.

744
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,360
i didn't think i was
going to be voted out.

745
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,540
I trusted the people in my alliance.

746
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,490
And,you know,it turns out
somebody wasn't being honest.

747
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,930
And that's just how it goes,but
possibly rob betrayed me.

748
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,120
Possibly phillip did.

749
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,320
But i'm at peace with everyry

750
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,820
