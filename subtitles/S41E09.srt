00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,867
-SHAN: Yeah.
-But, yeah, day 17.

166
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,502
-Right?
-EVVIE: Just think there...

167
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,778
SHAN:
Yeah.

168
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,584
ERIKA:
Like, are you serious?

169
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,852
You don't even see
that we're, like,

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,721
-right there?
-I guess they think

171
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,824
that, like, all the people
on the bottom are so scattered

172
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,126
that we could never
work together.

173
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,066
-LIANA: Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

174
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,601
-Oh, yes.
-SHAN: Yes, yes, yes.

175
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,708
Not and, like, be low-key.

176
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,278
I don't trust Erika,
not with some...

177
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,413
-There's something off there.
-Right.

178
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,918
You think maybe we should be
voting either Shan or Ricard?

179
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,654
-Maybe.
-Like, could we do...?

180
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,255
Could we pull in Naseer
as a number and tell him

181
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,324
-we're voting Erika and Xander?
-LIANA: Yeah.

182
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,695
<i>Xander's been a problem for me</i>
<i>for a really long time.</i>

183
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,799
<i>He continues to make it this far</i>
<i>with the idol in his pocket.</i>

184
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,934
<i>It just makes it</i>

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,368
more apparent
how much of a threat

186
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,371
he is in this game and how much
he does need to go.

187
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,307
What if we did...

188
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,908
I think it's better.

189
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,210
<i>Everyone's obsessed</i>
<i>with Xander</i>

190
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,744
<i>because he's got the idol, but</i>

191
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,379
I want to get rid of Erika.

192
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,548
<i>I feel like she's probably</i>
<i>one of the smarter players</i>

193
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,550
<i>in the game,</i>
<i>and I don't trust her.</i>

194
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,618
<i>Not even a little bit.</i>

195
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,497
Come on in.

196
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,910
All right, let's get to today's
immunity challenge.

197
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,013
First things first, Evvie.
Take back the necklace.

198
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

199
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:42,188
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

200
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,090
<i>For today's challenge,</i>
<i>you're going to balance</i>

201
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,626
<i>on a very narrow perch</i>
<i>with your hands</i>

202
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,228
<i>holding onto a handle</i>
<i>behind your head.</i>

203
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,831
<i>If at any point,</i>
<i>a hand comes off the handle</i>

204
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,935
<i>or a foot comes off the perch...</i>

205
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,403
you're out.

206
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,871
And to make it
a little more interesting,

207
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,275
today, we're going
to divide you into two groups.

208
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,710
-Oh, my gosh.
-PROBST: So,

209
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:09,715
two people will win immunity,
be safe.

210
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,651
Both groups will go
to Tribal Council

211
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,352
-separately
and vote somebody out.
-EVVIE: Ah, man.

212

-(others murmuring)
-So two winners,

213
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,623
-two people going home.
-Oh, gosh.

214
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,625
In addition, playing for reward.

215
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,760
Want to know what
you're playing for?

216
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,094
-(whooping)
-XANDER: Let's see it.

217

PROBST:
The last person left standing

218
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,767
in the challenge not only earns
immunity for themselves,

219
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,568
but you earn chicken
and beef stew

220
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,770
-for your group...
-Oh, man.

221
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,472
to be enjoyed back at camp.

222
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,309
We're going to draw for spots
to see which group you're in,

223
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,743
and we'll get started.

224
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,345
Gonna be a good one.

227
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,886
All right, everybody,

Get your feet up on the perch

229
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,523
and your hands
behind the handle.

230
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:51,891
Your feet are facing out.

-Mm-hmm.
-Yup.

Let's not waste any time.
This challenge is on.

Two groups.

It is Erika, Shan,

One person from each group
will be going home.

242
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,527
This is about pain management
'cause it's gonna hurt.

243
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,872
(wooden creaking)

244
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,544
I've watched people do this
over the years.

245
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,213
I know it's hurting already.

246
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,982
This is not a comfortable spot.

247
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,784
Everybody hurts
in this challenge.

248
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,254
You just keep fighting because

249
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,291
you never know when the person
next to you is going to drop.

250
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,028
-Jeff.
-PROBST: Evvie drops out.

-I'm not, either.
-(laughs)

268
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,038
Guys, I can stay two hours

-PROBST: Danny suddenly drops.

00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,920
He went

00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,823
We're down to two in blue.

277
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,160

287

Erika is safe tonight

She's now trying
to win chicken and beef Stew.

304
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,858
She can't do it.

305
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,595
ERIKA:
I'm sorry, guys, sorry.

306

who will have
the immunity necklace

311
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,739

00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,919
you can look back and say,
"I earned

333
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,589
-every minute in this game."
-(groans softly)

334
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:55,160
"Even challenges I didn't win,
I gave everything in the tank."

335
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,698
ERIKA:
Keep going. Keep going.

336
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,699
-LIANA: You got it, guys.
-You guys have

337
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,334
all you need to win. Keep going.

338
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,670
-PROBST:
You're at 33 minutes.
-SHAN: You got it.

339
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,473
You got it, Deshawn.
You've got it, Xander.

340
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,874
-ERIKA: Keep going, guys.
-SHAN: Looking great.

341
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,075
You guys are both
looking great up there.

342
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,844
PROBST:
That a way to fight, you guys.

343
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,022
-SHAN: Oh!
-PROBST: Deshawn drops out.

344
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:27,493
Xander wins individual immunity
and reward for his group.

345
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,094
What an effort. Take a break

346
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,796
-in the sand if you need it.
-Good job, guys.

347
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,365
Both guys trying
to find their bodies again.

348
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,768
(applause)

349
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,236
Huge effort.

350
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,506
-Man, if I can get
my arms around you.
-Oh, man.

351
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,643
-PROBST: Wow.
-(laughing): Oh, my gosh.

352
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,745
-PROBST: Wow.
-LIANA: Wow.

353
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,053
Erika, come on over.

354
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,256
Oh, my gosh.
Dream come true.

355
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,692
Oh, my gosh. I've just dreamed
of this moment

356
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,895
-since I was a kid.
-Congratulations.

357
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,664
You fought hard. You've earned
individual immunity.

358
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,500
You are not going home tonight.
Head back to your group because

359
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,836
-somebody is going home.
-ERIKA: Thanks, Jeff.

360
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,271
Xander, come on over.

361
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,839
SHAN:
Xander.

362
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,374
-Good job, Xander.
-PROBST: I was gonna say,

363
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,608
"Did you dream
of this as a kid?"

364
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,477
But you kind of are
still a young man.

365
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,413
Yeah, I mean, oh, my God,
to have this moment.

366
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,415
And, like, this challenge

367
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,385
I've dreamed of so many nights.
Since it's aired,

368
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,620
-like, this is made for me.
-PROBST: Congrats.

369
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,189
Go ahead and head back, Xander.

370
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,890
Good job.

371
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,293
PROBST:
Heather, Naseer, Shan,

372
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,095
Ricard, one of you going home
tonight.

373
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,429
You know it won't be Erika.

374
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,366
You're gonna go now
to the old Ua camp.

375
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,068
Grab your stuff, head out.

376
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,570
We'll see you tonight
at Tribal Council.

377
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,272
You will go first
and vote somebody out.

378
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,807
And then go back
to our real camp?

379
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,275
Then you go back
to your real camp.

380
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,044
-RICARD: Okay.
-Okay, that's good.

381
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,179
Xander, Evvie, Liana,

382
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,915
Danny, Deshawn, you will go
to Tribal Council second.

383
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,684
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

384
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,621
-Enjoy your well-earned reward.
-Thanks, Jeff.

385
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,490
<i>LIANA:</i>
<i>The fact that Xander won today,</i>
<i>I mean, it's just, like,</i>

386
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,491
so bad.

387
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,359
<i>He knows he has power</i>

388
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,562
<i>on his neck,</i>
<i>and that's not good for my game.</i>

389
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,898
<i>Every single draw,</i>
<i>it's like I'm with Xander.</i>

390
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,767
I'm like, what is going on
with this kid?

391
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,535
Like, can I get some space?"

392
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,414
EVVIE:
Oh, my God. This is so...

393
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,681
Look how much food this is

394
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,183
for the five of us.

395
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,851
It's also perfect 'cause
you always talk about stew.

396
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,753
-EVVIE: Yeah.
-XANDER: I know.

397
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,022
This is, like,
all I've been dreaming about.

398
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,224
<i>I have been dreaming of stew.</i>

399
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,861
And, aw, it hit the spot.

400
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,296
It does look good.

401
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,765
-Are you ready to dig in?
-It does.

402
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,002
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>I can't imagine a better day.</i>
<i>I have immunity.</i>

403
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,104
I also have an idol, and

404
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,006
<i>now that the numbers</i>
<i>are down to five,</i>

405
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,175
<i>this is a huge opportunity</i>
<i>for me</i>

406
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,144
<i>to take out the big dogs</i>
<i>on the top. Exactly what</i>

407
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,946
I've wanted to, or...

408
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,614
(burps)

409
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,918
Still digesting that stew.
(laughs)

410
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,187
This is so ... good.

411
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,621
It's unbelievable.

412
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,423
<i>EVVIE: Initially</i>
<i>just looking at the group,</i>

413
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,559
I thought that for sure
I would be in trouble.

414
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,861
<i>But the reality is,</i>
<i>Deshawn is really out</i>

415
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,998
<i>on the power group, so I think</i>
<i>for sure I have Deshawn, but</i>

416
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,700
<i>Xander-- he and I have</i>
<i>had a bumpy road,</i>

417
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,836
<i>especially the last couple days.</i>

418
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,003
So if Deshawn is with me

419
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,371
and Xander's with me,
I should be fine.

420
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,418
I mean...

421
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,889
EVVIE:
Liana.

422
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,458
Yeah.

423
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,459
<i>Liana's someone</i>

424
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,828
who's almost a minion to Shan,

425
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,830
<i>and that's so dangerous.</i>

426
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,166
<i>Not only that.</i>
<i>She has no trust in me.</i>

427
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,535
<i>She wants me gone. So,</i>

428
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,837
<i>Liana would be fantastic</i>
<i>for me to get rid of.</i>

429
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,522
Yes.

430
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,157
<i>DANNY:</i>
<i>It's a simple vote.</i>
<i>Evvie is going home tonight.</i>

431
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,425
<i>Fortunately,</i>

432
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,361
the luck of the draw gave us
three people

433
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,829
that are in our alliance--

434
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,997
<i>me, Deshawn and Liana.</i>

435
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,965
<i>With only five people,</i>

436
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,800
we have the power,
uh, in this vote.

437
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,705
-This is the chance.
-I know.

438
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,808
<i>For me tonight,</i>
<i>I'm definitely writing Evvie,</i>

439
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,078
<i>but my biggest worry is</i>
<i>Xander has an idol.</i>

440
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,015
If he were to potentially
play it for Evvie,

441
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,817
<i>that could be a huge problem.</i>
<i>I could go home tonight.</i>

442
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,319
What are you thinking?

443
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,954
I want to hear the name
that you have.

444
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,356
Most threatening--
between Evvie and Deshawn.

445
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,925
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>Between Evvie and Deshawn?</i>

446
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,960
<i>-LIANA: Yeah.</i>
<i>-Everybody</i>

447
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,461
wants Evvie out, though.

448
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,331
-She's not someone
we have to worry about.
-Okay.

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,969
I don't know.

450
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,638
The hesitancy is,
you do have your idol.

451
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,206
-Yeah.
-So...

452
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,375
I'm definitely... I'm... I'll
have you know I'm considering.

453
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,713
<i>I woke up on the bottom.</i>

454
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,382
Now I'm the prom king, and
everybody wants to take me aside

455
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,384
<i>and give me advice in the game.</i>

456
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,356
Like...

457
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,194
-You would do that?
-Well, I mean, not to you.

458
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,497
<i>It's a little funny to me</i>
<i>that Liana feels</i>

459
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,266
in a place to make demands.

460
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,068
<i>She's got a big target</i>
<i>on her back,</i>

461
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,538
<i>and she knows it.</i>
<i>Liana has shown her cards,</i>

462
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,274
<i>and I'm ready to expose them.</i>

463
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,210
XANDER:
They've got such
an interesting dynamic.

464
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,013
EVVIE:
Uh, on the other group-- I know,
I was thinking about that.

465
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,383
-Would be Naseer and, uh, Shan.
-Yeah, Shan.

466
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,718
<i>-EVVIE: Right?</i>
<i>-XANDER: Both have idols.</i>

467
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,319
<i>-DESHAWN: Yeah.</i>
<i>-EVVIE: Yeah.</i>

468
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,355
<i>EVVIE:</i>
<i>And Shan and Ricard together.</i>

469
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,857
<i>XANDER: But Erika</i>
<i>and Heather are really close.</i>
<i>-EVVIE: Right.</i>

470
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,192
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>And then that leaves Naseer,</i>

471
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,526
<i>and he's such a wild card.</i>

472
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,862
SHAN:
Well, it sucks being back at Ua.

473
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,263
Man, our camp is much better.

474
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,265
-I hate it here.
-SHAN: I hate this camp.

475
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,235
<i>Erika winning was a bad thing</i>

476
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,270
for my game
because I did want her out.

477
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,673
-Heather, do you want
to go pick some limes? Okay.
-Yeah.

478
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,075
<i>SHAN:</i>
<i>So maybe this is an opportunity</i>
<i>to get Heather out</i>

479
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,778
<i>because Heather is an ally</i>
<i>to Erika.</i>

480
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,781
Well, I know Ricard and I
are a solid two,

481
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,083
and we've been working with you.
I mean,

482
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,019
it's three votes on Heather.

483
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,787
-Okay.
-And if we need to,

484
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,455
I have an extra vote
I can put on her.

485
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:34,059
Okay, and I don't want you
to waste your idol.

486
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,394
I don't want you
to waste yours, either.

487
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,762
That's what I'm saying.
Stick together.

488

<i>NASEER:</i>
<i>I feel amazing.</i>
<i>Heather will be going home.</i>

-Mom, I'm sorry.
-HEATHER: What?

495
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,016
Wow.

496
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,585
These two are my closest ally.

497
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,555
ERIKA:
There must be, like,
something else we can do.

498
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,026
Yeah, but you just have
one idol?

499
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,696
-Yeah.
-Would you play that
for Heather?

500
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,666
Yeah. No way.

501
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,201
-No?
-So I have to take care

502
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,036
-of myself, you know?
-Mm-hmm.

503
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,476
-Got it.
<i>-ERIKA: Naseer seems confident</i>

504
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,345
<i>it's going to be an easy vote,</i>
<i>and Heather's going home.</i>

505
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,381

<i>it's no secret to anyone</i>
<i>that Heather and I are close.</i>

507
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,552
I really am saying,
do what you need to do.

508
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,420
-There will be no hard feelings.
-Yeah.

509
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,622
-I'm ready to talk about that.
-I'm-I'm not voting for you.

510
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,157
Okay. I understand.
(stammers) I get it.

511
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,993
-Who? Naseer?
-Naseer. Yeah.

512
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,163
<i>So I would love</i>
<i>to get rid of Naseer,</i>

513
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,932
<i>or I was hoping that, like,</i>

514
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,801
<i>maybe there's the chance</i>
<i>to vote out Shan.</i>

515
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,169
<i>The problem is, there's</i>

516
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,505
so much power concentrated
with the people

517
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,340
who are here,
knowing that Naseer has an idol,

518
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,442
<i>Shan has so many advantages.</i>

519
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,277
<i>It seems like</i>
<i>there's not a lot of options.</i>

520
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,713
I really did want
to split up Shan and Liana,

521
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,181
but I'm hoping,
on the other side,

522
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,217
-they take out Liana.
-I hope they do.

523
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,056
-We were talking things out.
-Yeah?

524
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,893
I just feel like
you guys have been...

525
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,930
...with Shan and Ricard
and Liana.

526

I don't even feel
like I'm in it,

527
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,870
and I don't want to be in it,

528
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,505
because I want to play
my own endgame.

529
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,445
DESHAWN:
Whoa. Are you serious?

530
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,781
<i>Xander's telling me Liana</i>

531
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,149
<i>tried to flip the vote on me,</i>

532
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,617
<i>but I don't know</i>
<i>if that's the truth.</i>

533

<i>But at the end of the day,</i>
<i>I'm gonna be at the top,</i>

534
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,521

trying to be funny.

535
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,922
It's just me being real.

536
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,724
<i>Like, I've put myself</i>
<i>perfectly in the middle.</i>

537

that you guys

538

that I could help you with,

539
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,028
I'm down to do that.

540
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,164
XANDER:
I'm willing to say
right here now...

541
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,933
Let's do it. Done?

542
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,768
-Yeah, let's make it tomorrow.
-Do it, please.

543
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,170
<i>Evvie and I had made a deal</i>

544
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,505
before we even knew that we were
splitting into this five,

545
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,507
<i>and we said we were going</i>
<i>to protect each other.</i>

546

-Yeah.

547

<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>But if I take out Liana,</i>

548

<i>there are gonna be repercussions</i>
<i>from the power alliance,</i>

549
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,450
and then that could put me
in a compromising position.

550
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,085
'Cause right now they think
we're still together.

556
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,635

-Yes. Yes.

559
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:43,515
When-when else will we have

<i>I was really convinced that</i>

<i>Evvie would be a better move.</i>

564

565
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,062
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>And that scares me because</i>

566
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,864

567
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,332

568
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,601
<i>And I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to try and stop that.</i>

569
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,804
<i>So, maybe I should play</i>
<i>my idol for Evvie</i>

570
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,241
because this Tribal is crucial
for the rest of my game.

571
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,447
SHAN: What do you think
is gonna happen

572
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,781
on the other side tonight?

573
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,884
We never know in this game
'cause Xander--

574
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,952
he has the idol.
He may play to Evvie.

575
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,520
-Yeah, we never know
-RICARD: We'll just see.

576
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,556
It doesn't even affect
our plan.

577
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,525
-SHAN: Yeah.
-Yeah.

578
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,127
<i>Everyone has this huge target</i>
<i>for Heather,</i>

579
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,396
<i>and I'm baffled by it.</i>
<i>She has no advantages.</i>

580
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,031
<i>She has no idol,</i>

581
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,134
and yet everyone's focusing
their attention on her.

582
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,570
<i>And so, I have to focus</i>
<i>on an actual threat.</i>

583
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,472
-They are going to vote you.
-Mm-hmm.

584
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,173
But they both have idols.

585
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,175
-Yeah. Yup.
-Okay, that's scary, but

586
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,411
I think
Naseer is the bigger threat,

587
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,581
and I need to make Naseer feel
so comfortable

588
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,349
-that he doesn't play his idol
tonight.
-Yes.

589
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,084
And I think
that really is a possibility.

590
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,453

to make him feel good.
-Yeah. Yeah.

-Yeah.
-Yeah. I'm sorry.
-No, I'm... I agree.

<i>Oh, my God! This is epic.</i>

596
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,634
<i>and just convince Naseer I'm sad</i>
<i>that I'm going home because</i>

597

if Naseer plays his idol,

If I need to get voted out,
I'm okay.

do their part to make it happen.

603
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,951
Those two are going
to be voting Naseer,

604
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,653
and we use the extra vote
on Naseer, but...

605
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,888
-Yeah, it's two-three.
-...we need to make sure

606
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,156
there's a Heather vote
out there.

607
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,724
And we need to make sure
there's enough of them

608
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,359
in case they do
try anything sneaky.

609
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,627
So then
we're all gonna vote who?

610
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,729
Naseer, and then he's gone.

611
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,364
Then we're fine.

612
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,333
I want to vote
Heather's ass out.

613
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,134
No! Heather makes no sense,
Shan.

614
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,602
Absolutely none.
She has nothing.

615
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,604
She has no alliance
except Erika.

616
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,007
She has no advantages.
Naseer has an idol.

617
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,444
-Because I don't trust
Heather and Erika.
-I don't care.

618
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,878
That doesn't make sense.

to do this?

00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,116
Well, I'll cast the extra vote.

622
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,920

624
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,324

00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,468
-Which sucks.
-(laughter)
-It's just awful.

658
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,870
-It's just awful.
-PROBST: Do you even care

659
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,805
that you're there?
Does it just become about,

660
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,441
"What are we gonna do?
There's only five people,

661
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,310
-and Erika's safe"?
-RICARD: I mean,

662
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,345
Shan and myself have clearly
been together

663
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,981
since the very beginning,
and we've been very close

664
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,516
with Naseer,
and Erika is clearly safe.

665
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,053
And so, there seems
to be a more clear-cut choice.

666

that

667
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,492
you could be
a very easy vote tonight?

668
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,627
I<i> am</i> the easy vote tonight.

669
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,230
You know, I'm still hopeful
there's going to be a miracle,

670
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,432
and some idol is going
to just fall out of the sky.

671
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,034
Cue the idol.

672
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,238
Oh, my God.

673
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,973
Oh.

674

-Didn't work, did it?
-PROBST: What's the move?

676
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,779
If you feel
you're on the bottom,

677
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,916
do you just hold,
or do you try to make a move?

678
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,651
I-I... I don't have a-a person

679
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,119
that I could point to
at this point

680
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,622
because I don't have the goodies
to keep me safe.

681
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,323
I don't have the idol,
I don't have the extra vote.

682
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,160
-It's just me right now.
-ERIKA: I mean, it's not like

683
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,661
we laid down our swords.

684
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,063
Like, Heather and I are a pair.
We pitched to everyone.

685
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,266
"Like, we're two votes,
if you want to do something."

686
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,433
But the problem is,

687
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,502
everyone knows
where the advantages are.

688
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,171
And the advantages are not
with Heather and I.

689
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,206
So I think if you're not someone
with an advantage,

690
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,409
it actually creates, like,
all these obstacles for you.

691
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,480
Why does everybody know
what everybody has?

692
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,982
We know we had to activate--
it was a three-way activate.

693
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,118
NASEER:
Activate a three-way
shared idol, so,

694
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,120
I do have
an hidden immunity idol.

695
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,789
And we've worked hard
to get that power.

696
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,126
I don't want to give up
that power to save someone else

697
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,628
'cause maybe I may need
to use for myself.

698
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,731
PROBST:
Shan, often when people know
you have an idol,

699
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,333
you're worried
they're going to come for you

700
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,601
because they want you
to play it.

701
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,735
-Yeah.
-But it sounds like

702
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,103
this group has a different

703
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,872
maybe approach this season.

704
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,708
I-I mean, it-it seems
like there's an obvious

705
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,476
decision to make tonight,

706
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,345
because
Naseer, myself and Ricard

707
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,646
have been voting together.

708
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,448
But at the same time,

709
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,883
I feel just as much at risk.

710
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,919
You know, the only person
that's safe tonight is Erika.

711
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,989
Ricard, any time
there's a small group like this,

712
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,490
it is dangerous.

713
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,260
But every time
there's a dangerous situation,

714
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,562
for someone
there's opportunity.

715
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,498
What's complicated
with this particular season--

716
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,334
it's not very easy to say,

717
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,769
"Oh, this person has an idol.
Let's vote them out."

718
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,171
The reality is,

719
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,608
the three of us have
three advantages in this game.

720
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,277
And you're gonna make the same
argument to all of us saying,

721
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,012
"Oh, I can't say,
vote this person out

722
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,747
"'cause they have an idol
'cause you have an idol.

723
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,083
And I can't say that to you
'cause you have an advantage."

724
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,385
It's just a hard day, hard day.

725
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,721
It's a hard day for everybody.

726
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,022
Why is it hard for you, Naseer?

727
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,757
'Cause Heather and I--
we had a relationship.

728
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,326
Like, from the beginning,
it's like on a roller coaster.

729
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,462
But I approached her
'cause I'm still learning.

730
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,598
There's a lot to learn.
So, she's a great teacher,

like mother.

732
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,271

to leave.

733

00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,725
But the bigger question is,
now what?

829
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,694
DESHAWN:
Yeah, I mean,
it's unfortunate because

830
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,530
there are four people here
who I wanted

831
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,165
to really work with
and who I feel

832
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,034
like I've developed
decent relationships with,

833
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,802
but there's nowhere to hide
in this Tribal Council.

834
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,471
Somebody has to go home,

835
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,339
and unfortunately
it's going to be somebody

836
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,242
who I actually wanted
to work with in this game, so...

837
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,910
PROBST:
So, Liana, you guys have had
some crazy

838
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,979
Tribals so far,
but this is different

839
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,982
'cause it's a small group.
Do you feel that?

840
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,917
Absolutely. I think, you know,
there's four of us

841
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,887
here on the chopping block.
25% chance of going home.

842
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,390
So, you know,
it becomes even more real.

843
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,759
Like, the game is as dangerous
as it's ever been.

844
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,695
And it's very real,
and my heart is beating so fast

845
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,064
in my chest right now
because of how real it is.

846
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,500
Xander, did you have
more power today

847
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,736
because you were safe, and
there's an odd number in five?

848
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,973
I mean, yeah. Certainly, people
are going to be kissing up

849
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,042
to the person
who does have the power.

850
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:35,079
And it's important to pay
attention to which people are

851
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,882
actually genuine and who I want
to go forward with.

852
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,318
PROBST:
Evvie, everybody's cagey.

853
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,120
-Nobody's really said anything.
-Right.

854
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,856
That seems true. (laughs)

855
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:49,393
I mean, I'm sure
there's a number of plans, but

856
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,095
I'm, like, 75% sure

857
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,830
that what I think is
gonna happen will happen.

858
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,733
Let's do that.
Let's just go around the horn.

859
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,568
Liana, how comfortable are you

860
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,704
that your plan is the one
that will happen tonight?

861
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,972
Pretty comfortable.

862
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,174
PROBST:
How about you, Deshawn?

863
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,376
I'm pretty comfortable.

864
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,645
-How about you, Xander?
-I'd say pretty comfortable.

865
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,413
PROBST:
How about you, Danny?

866
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,915
Before I walked up here
to Tribal,

867
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,516
I was pretty comfortable.

868
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,051
And then realization hit me once

869
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,386
I saw Naseer sitting up there

870
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,121
that you-you never really know,

871
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,757
and the reminder's sitting
right there in front of us.

872
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,494
Deshawn, everybody here must be
playing a very good game

873
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,963
because everybody's
pretty sure they're right.

874
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,264
If all of us here are saying

875
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,733
that we're pretty comfortable,
somebody lied

876
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,568
to somebody, so I think
we're gonna find out,

877
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,403
like, who's who in the zoo
when it comes

878
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,172
to who's telling the truth
and who's not, so we'll see.

879
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,509
PROBST:
Evvie, does that excite you
that you're playing

880
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:41,612
-with people
that are this good at it?
-EVVIE: Absolutely.

881
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,948
I mean, it's like you're
at the top of a roller coaster

882
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,016
and you, like, feel like
you're gonna die.

883
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,285
But, like, the fun part is
when at the end, you don't die.

884
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,987
I... you know, I've gotten
to the point where I, like,

885
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,956
looked<i> Survivor</i> death
in the face

886
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,425
and lived,
and it's freaking exhilarating.

887
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,093
You know?
But, uh, I really think

888
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,662
that the thing that I think's
gonna happen will happen.

889
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,464
-So, I just hope it happens.
-PROBST: So, Deshawn,

890
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,466
using Evvie's analogy,

891
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,135
we're up here
on the roller coaster then?

892
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,636
DESHAWN:
Absolutely.
We're all in this car,

893
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,973
this roller coaster car
together, and unfortunately,

894
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,575
in this scenario,
somebody's going to die.

895
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,779
On that note, it's time to vote.

896
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,548
