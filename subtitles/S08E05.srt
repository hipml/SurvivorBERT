00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,419
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,588
<i>Survivor:</i> A storm devastated
the Saboga Tribe.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,508
>> The stupid shelter;
that I built was destroyed.

4
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,593
Digging into the sand
is the dumbest idea

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,388
I've ever had in my life.
>> PROBST: But at Chapera,

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,724
the tribe weathered the storm
in comfort...

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,934
>> I slept almost all
night long.

8
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,894
>> PROBST: ...giving Rob and
Amber's alliance a chance

9
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,064
to heat up.
>> You're so warm.

10
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,401
>> Boston Rob and Amber
are going to do it.

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,778
>> PROBST: At the reward
challenge, Chapera continued

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,115
their winning streak.
Chapera... rice tonight.

13
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,617
In addition, take a shower,
get cleaned up.

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,120
Back at camp,
the tribe got clean

15
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,498
and found the final key
to their lockbox.

16
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,959
>> Oh.
>> You guys, that's alcohol.

17
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,629
That's whiskey.
>> Hey, guys, we got rice!

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,132
>> PROBST: The rice helped
Chapera to an early lead

19
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,468
during a very physical
immunity challenge.

20
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,803
Chapera, first to start
building the puzzle.

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,973
But the puzzle proved difficult,
and Saboga and Mogo Mogo

22
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,268
both took immunity,
leaving Chapera

23
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,480
with their first immunity loss.
Before Tribal Council,

24
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,025
the two Robs made a pact.
>> We can make good allies.

25
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,486
>> I agree.
>> I made an alliance with

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,490
Boston Rob, and a deal's a deal.
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

27
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,534
Council, Rob C. learned
he'd been played.

28
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,663
Rob, the tribe has spoken.
Fourteen are left.

29
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:30,715
Who will be voted out tonight?
(birds chirping)

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:02:50,545
Who will be voted out tonight?
(birds chirping)

31
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,757
>> Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.
>> ♪ Well, last time I seen

32
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,553
her standing on a hill ♪
Shaking her boobs and... ♪

33
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:05,560
( all yelling and singing )
>> We got to build a boat!

34
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,647
>> Oh, my God.
>> I did this in Marquesas.

35
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,483
>> "Put on your game face
for this reward

36
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,110
you will compete.
This may change your situation

37
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,071
and the quantities you eat.
Here are the supplies

38
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,616
to build a raft,
one that four of you can race.

39
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,911
Tribe pride is on the line.
You'd better keep up the pace."

40
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,080
>> Four of us can race.
Chances are, Tom, you might

41
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,457
sit out, 'cause you're
the biggest guy.

42
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,958
You're going to drag
the boat down, so...

43
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,835
>> I'm an anchor.
>> Well, this morning we got

44
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,129
some tree mail which
involves building a raft.

45
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,132
We got a bunch of bamboo,
some rope and one paddle.

46
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,343
The biggest part of the
challenge is obviously

47
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:48,436
building it.
>> We'll probably be... here...

48
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,650
building it.
>> We'll probably be... here...

49
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,944
to have the two power strokes.
You'll be there.

50
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,821
You'll be there.
You put two bundles and then

51
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,658
the platform right on it.
Then we're making outriggers.

52
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,494
It's like a big catamaran.
>> Apparently, we're building

53
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:09,749
a pontoon boat, a catamaran
possibly-- I'm not sure--

54
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,834
with two bundles of bamboo
underneath supporting the

55
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,005
platform.
It sounds great in theory.

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,758
I hope it works.
I'm a little bit worried

57
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,177
about building stuff now,
ever since our...

58
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,848
first shelter fiasco.
>> I love it.

59
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,684
>> Let's start lashing the top
to it.

60
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,812
I feel very good about the raft.
I'm trying to not think

61
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,481
about the house.
You know, I got my reputation

62
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,859
riding on this damn thing again.
>> Okay, guys, we have

63
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,153
to win this today.
We're going to have to paddle

64
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,531
our asses off.
>> We came up with a good

65
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,033
design, and with four paddles,
we should be able to fly.

66
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:54,502
We want to win.
>> The key is you got to use

67
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,380
every blooming piece of bamboo.
>> Do you use full length,

68
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,382
or do you make it shorter?
>> Full length.

69
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,217
>> Yeah?
>> Why?

70
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,219
>> 'Cause, you know what?
It's too much energy

71
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:05,388
to cut it down.
>> It could be very,

72
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,016
very, very simple.
These bundles, as they are,

73
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,685
will never sink.
Don't think too hard.

74
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,521
Simple is always better.
The challenge was

75
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,356
to construct a raft...
that was worthy...

76
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,111
of the sea
and could carry four of us.

77
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,072
So that meant this raft
not only had to carry Lex

78
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,658
and Kathy and I
and a normal human being,

79
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,037
but it's got to carry
260 pounds of Hatch.

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,081
>> I think it's good for
steering.

81
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,917
>> Let's kind of go back and
forth and see how stable it is.

82
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,587
But ultimately,
it came down to laziness

83
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,423
and pure exhaustion
that designed that raft,

84
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:46,095
and nothing more.
>> The raft will definitely

85
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,807
float, but it won't be swift.
It will not be swift.

86
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,566
>> I'm going to tell
you something.

87
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:03,613
That raft...
That one's going to

88
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,615
win us this challenge.
>> I say nice rack...

89
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,452
Oh, raft.
>> Yeah, wait.

90
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,288
Have you been drinking?
>> No. No, I just...

91
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,166
I-I meant "raft"
when I said "rack."

92
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,794
>> Hey, Tom, I got
your waterbed for you.

93
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,297
>> All right.
>> That's the best built thing

94
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,634
since Alicia.
>> If I could vote anybody out

95
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,471
right now, it'd be Tom.
He's a stupid drunk.

96
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,517
A stupid klutzy drunk.
I don't care for the man

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,477
whatsoever.
I don't think his sexual

98
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,649
innuendoes are funny.
>> I christen the ship.

99
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,984
>> Tom came down with the
whiskey to christen the vessel.

100
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,820
>> I christen...
>> Oh, yeah!

101
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,447
>> And I'm like, "Oh, you guys,
don't move, I got to pee."

102
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:55,665
So I peed right on the raft.
So that we decided that I

103
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,459
christened it right there.
>> You pissed on it?

104
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,545
It's supposed to be
pure grain liquor.

105
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,881
Kiss my ass.
What a hag.

106
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,926
My God, that's going to make
a hole in the driftwood.

107
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,513
That'll rot any wood I know.
I'm afraid the ship's

108
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,182
going to sink now.
Where did Sue piss?

109
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,810
>> Right here.
>> Go, Tom, you do the honors.

110
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,020
>> Okay.
>> I christen thee...

111
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,691
>> I christen thee vessel
the Suzie Q., in honor

112
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:26,487
of me old lady Sue.
( all cheer )

113
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,741
And in the honor,
I shall take one little goober.

114
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:42,670
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
What's going on, Saboga?

115
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,883
>> Life's good.
>> PROBST: What's up, Mogo Mogo?

116
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,220
Come on in, Chapera.
Getting your first look at the

117
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,850
new Chapera tribe.
>> Damn, Sue's still here.

118
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,436
>> Cesternino.
>> PROBST: Rob voted out at the

119
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,023
last Tribal Council.
Nobody's safe in this game.

120
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,692
All right, you ready
for today's challenge?

121
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,235
>> Yes, sir.
This morning,

122
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,362
you were given materials,
told to build a raft.

123
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,323
Here's how the challenge works:
two tribe members

124
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,576
will start on the raft.
Their job, paddle out and rescue

125
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,412
two other tribe members
who have been stranded

126
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,415
in the water
on separate floating platforms.

127
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,209
Once you've picked up
both tribe members,

128
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,252
continue out to a buoy.
You'll grab a flag,

129
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,129
paddle back to shore
up the beach,

130
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,548
across the finish line.
First two tribes to get back

131
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,759
with their boat and run
across the finish line

132
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,595
with their flag win reward.
Want to know what

133
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,930
you're playing for?
>> Yes.

134
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,098
>> PROBST: For the winning
tribe...

135
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,100
What might be in here,
Hatch?

136
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,561
>> Fish hooks.
>> PROBST: Fishing hooks.

137
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,398
To go along with the fishing
hooks, a fishing spear.

138
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,568
>> Oh, yeah!
>> PROBST: Should make fishing

139
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,570
a whole lot easier.
In addition, for the

140
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,281
first two tribes,
a clue to your lock box.

141
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,243
Chapera, it has no value to you.
You've already had your rice

142
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,161
and most of your whiskey...
but for Saboga

143
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,789
and Mogo Mogo, it could
mean rice tonight.

144
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,625
For the third part of the
reward, the tribe that

145
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,462
finishes last will be dissolved.
>> What?

146
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,339
>> PROBST: The tribe members
will be absorbed

147
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,758
by the two remaining tribes.
We're going to have

148
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,510
a school yard game
of "Pick 'Em."

149
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,428
We will alternate picks.
The winning tribe

150
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,682
gets to pick first.
For the losing tribe,

151
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,809
you will not return
back to your beach.

152
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,436
Your personal items and any
other clothing items will be

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,314
sent to your new home.
Everything else: rewards,

154
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,191
your shelter, tools, anything
else you've acquired,

155
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,985
you'll never see again.
Worth playing for?

156
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,653
>> Yes, sir.
>> PROBST: Chapera, you have

157
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,321
one extra member.
Who sat out during

158
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,156
the building of the raft?
>> Big Tom.

159
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,992
>> PROBST: So you won't
participate in this.

160
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,827
Mogo Mogo, who sat out?
>> Shii Ann.

161
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,787
>> PROBST: Shii Ann.
So you won't participate either.

162
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,664
I'll give you a couple
of minutes to strategize.

163
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:47,169
Wait for my go.
Here we go, guys:

164
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,297
a reward challenge
with huge stakes.

165
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,010
Survivors ready?
Go!

166
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:59,682
>> Go, Mogo Mogo!
>> PROBST: Everybody even

167
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,519
off the start.
All rafts are floating.

168
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:08,524
That's a good sign.
>> We got it.

169
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:14,822
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo out
to a slight lead.

170
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:21,662
Saboga's raft looks nice,
but it's slow.

171
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,374
Mogo Mogo pulling away
with the worst-looking raft

172
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:30,755
of the three.
Mogo Mogo approaches Kathy.

173
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:40,181
Don't jump in, Kathy.
Get on.

174
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,892
Mogo Mogo still
with the big lead.

175
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,727
Saboga approaches
their first member,

176
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,563
looking to pick up Jenna.
Chapera close to picking up

177
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,024
Alicia.
Alicia pulls 'em in

178
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,234
tight and steps onboard.
Chapera has their

179
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,737
first tribe member.

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,574
first tribe member.

Lex, Colby and Kathy
nearing Richard.

182
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:07,333
Richard pulls 'em close.
Hatch is onboard.

183
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:18,761
( indistinct talking )
>> PROBST: Saboga by far

184
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,932
with the best looking raft
and the least effective.

185
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:29,271
Chapera nears Amber.
Amber's onboard.

186
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,024
Chapera has all their tribe
members, heading for the flag.

187
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,445
Mogo Mogo at their flag.
Kathy reaches for the flag...

188
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,492
and she has it.
Mogo Mogo heading back.

189
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,744
Saboga has all
four tribe members.

190

They're heading for their flag.

( indistinct shouting )
Chapera reaches for

192
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,508
their tribe flag.
They have it-- Chapera

193
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,468
has their flag.
They're heading back.

194
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,805
Mogo Mogo with a big lead.
>> Come on, Mogo Mogo.

195
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,474
>> PROBST: Saboga needs to make
up a lot of ground.

196
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,936
Losing tribe will be dissolved,
absorbed by the other two

197
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,814
tribes.
You do not want to be last

198
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,276
in this challenge.
Rupert has the flag for Saboga.

199
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,945
It is a race back to shore
between Saboga and Chapera

200
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:25,035
for second place.
( shouts of encouragement )

201
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,706
>> PROBST: Hit the flag with
your raft and you're there.

202
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,292
>> Hit it! Hit it!
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo's clear.

203
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,794
It's a race in to the finish.
Mogo Mogo celebrating

204
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,464
before they even finish.
>> Come on,

205
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:42,511
run to the finish line!
( shouts of joy )

206
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,015
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo wins reward
and keeps their tribe together.

207
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,683
Let's go, Saboga!
Let's go, Chapera!

208
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:54,064
>> We get to pick first. Okay.
Bring him along, Rich.

209
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:59,403
>> Yeah, bring him along.
>> Bring him?

210
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:06,952
>> It's coming.
It's coming.

211
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,079
>> PROBST: Chapera, raft's got
to hit the flag.

212
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,499
You're clear.
It's a race across

213
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:25,054
the finish line.
Chapera finishes second,

214
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:35,022
keeps their tribe intact.
( applause )

215
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:40,736
Saboga finishes last, and Saboga
will soon be no longer.

216
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,246
>> PROBST: Okay, first things
first.

217
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,041
Mogo Mogo.
Your fishing spear.

218
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,418
>> Yes!
Richard!

219
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,462
>> PROBST: Hooks.
( whoops )

220
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,756
>> PROBST: Last clue to the lock
box.

221
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,425
Find the key, you'll have rice.
Here's how it's going to work:

222
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,262
it is a schoolyard pick 'em.
Mogo Mogo, since you won,

223
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,723
you'll pick first.
As you are selected, come to me,

224
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,060
we'll trade buffs.
Mogo Mogo, who's your first

225
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,937
pick?
>> Ethan.

226
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,649
>> PROBST: Ethan, come on over.
Saboga no more.

227
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:24,488
Mogo Mogo.
Chapera, first pick?

228
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,949
>> Rupert.
>> PROBST: Rupert, no longer

229
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,286
a member of Saboga.
You are now a member of Chapera.

230
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,958
>> Yeah, baby!
>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo, make your

231
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,586
next pick.
>> Jerri.

232
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,422
>> Come on, Jerri.
>> PROBST: Jerri and Colby

233
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:49,305
reunited.
Jerri now a member of Mogo Mogo.

234
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,934
Jenna, you get the honor, if
it is, putting Saboga to rest.

235
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:59,773
You're now a member of Chapera.
( cheering )

236
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,652
All right, guys,
you all have a lot of time

237
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:09,366
to get to know each other--
head back to camp.

238
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,299
>> All right, guys, on three.
Ready?

239
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,468
One, two, three...
>> Mogo Mogo!

240
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:32,348
>> Welcome home, you guys.
>> I'm... so happy.

241
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,142
>> Winning the Reward Challenge,
the biggest reward

242
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,520
was gaining control
of dismantling Saboga.

243
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,524
We chose Ethan because we knew
if we had him on our tribe,

244
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,235
we had control of how long
he stays in this game.

245
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,279
And then after that,
we just wanted someone

246
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,406
that we didn't think
he had bonded with that much,

247
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,367
and Jerri was the answer.
We still have

248
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,870
the original Mogo Mogo Tribe,
and Jerri and Ethan are

249
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:59,208
on the outside looking in.
>> Oh, my God!

250
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,002
This is beautiful.
>> And see our little balcony?

251
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,380
>> I love it.
>> Wow, that's fantastic.

252
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,383
>> It's pretty waterproof.
>> You guys, this is amazing.

253
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,510
>> I feel like
my entire time out here,

254
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,846
every day I've started over.
And now I'm on a new tribe,

255
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,725
start over again.
It's just, like, one big...

256
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,728
first day for me.
>> Can I just say thank you.

257
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,522
I'm very, very happy
to be over here.

258
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,524
>> Good!
We're happy you're here.

259
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,609
>> I'm gonna cry.
>> We're glad to have you.

260
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,194
>> I swore I wouldn't
cry anymore.

261
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,905
My spirits are
very high right now.

262
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:34,952
I don't miss Saboga at all.
Not even a little.

263
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,961
>> You'll be happy.
You'll be happy here.

264
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,463
>> I will be very happy here.
>> I can't believe

265
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,757
it worked out like that,
I can't believe it.

266
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,302
Wait till you see our camp.
>> Over at Saboga,

267
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,430
I had complete control,
and I was telling everyone

268
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,724
who to vote off.
And then they dissolved us,

269
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,226
which I don't like,
because the first 13 days

270
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,980
that I had put into this game
washed down the toilet.

271
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,606
>> Oh, man.
>> Cool, right?

272
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,567
( Rupert laughing )
>> Sit down.

273
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,736
>> Oh, my God.
>> We have the swing set

274
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,821
and the chess board.
>> Does it hold you, Tom?

275
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,616
>> Oh, yeah.
>> I can sit? Oh, my God.

276
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,454
>> Their camp is...
( exhales )

277
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,915
...compared to our camp,
our camp was hobo junction.

278
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:27,629
Theirs is the Taj Mahal.
( indistinct chatter )

279
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,466
>> We're home! We're home!
Yay!

280
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,926
>> We're going to kick
the green team's ass.

281
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:42,978
( applause )
>> It's in a shallow grave.

282
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:51,278
( applause )
>> It's in a shallow grave.

283
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,989
>> First thing this morning,
got up, went and looked for

284
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:57,951
the key.
( key rattling )

285
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,330
( cheering )
>> It felt so good to find it.

286
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,458
I was so excited.
Everybody's, like, "Yay, Jerri!"

287
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:10,172
I'm feeling, "Yay,
now I'm a part of Mogo Mogo."

288
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,341
>> Oh, nice.
( gasps )

289
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,676
>> Oh, my God.
Wow.

290
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,223
>> Wow. Oh, nice.
>> The rice is soggy.

291
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,477
>> Oh, my God, it's totally wet.
Unfortunately, when we opened

292
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:31,985
the carton, the rice...
half the rice was rotten.

293
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,198
>> We lost a lot of rice.
The note on the box did say,

294
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:41,370
"Keep this dry. Very valuable."
And we tried our best.

295
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,165
I've run out of rice
once before, and the

296
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,918
consequences aren't good.
I don't want to do it again.

297
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,587
Even though we have rice,
we do still need fish.

298
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:55,092
I'm going to go when it gets
low, so that's probably

299
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,803
hour and a half.
I'm not going to go till then.

300
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,055
If you have any interest
in high tide...

301
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:02,266
>> I'm gonna try it
for a little bit, too.

302
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,019
>> Go get 'em, man.
>> Good luck, Ethan.

303
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,522
>> I think Ethan's always,
uh, playing the game--

304
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,608
he's, "Sure, I'll go try,
sure I'll go try," not wanting

305
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,278
to go step on my toes.
"No. Are you going to go?

306
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,822
No? If you're not,
I'll go try when you aren't."

307
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:25,414
Ooh, he's good.
>> Ethan, how'd you do?

308
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,875
>> Not much, but...
every little bit helps.

309
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,919
I went out there
and I went spear fishing.

310
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,422
Inside I'm jumping, I'm like,
"I caught my first fish!"

311
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,258
And I see Richard's face,
he's, like, competition.

312
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,095
Like, I felt scared.
I didn't want to, you know,

313
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,598
step on his toes.
>> You got a trigger.

314
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,059
Killer.
>> Hot dog.

315
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,104
>> He got a fish.
I'm the only one

316
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:53,442
that's supposed to get fish.
I'm gonna have to fix that up

317
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:58,906
and bring back 12 now.
>> Oh, my God, look at the fish

318
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,116
that you've got.
>> Two of them.

319
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,243
>> It's huge.
( cheering )

320
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,621
>> All right, Richard!
>> Guys want to feud

321
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,499
on how many fish they bring in,
( laughs ): rock on.

322
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,502
We'll just have lots of fish,
'cause the boys are just playing

323
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,756
one-up on each other.
>> We have a ton of fish here.

324
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:25,807
Oh, Richard, that looks awesome.
>> "Two new tribes, now we'll

325
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:35,984
Oh, Richard, that looks awesome.
>> "Two new tribes, now we'll

326
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,654
see whose speed and strength
earn immunity.

327
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,198
It's really quite simple.
Capture the flag, that's it.

328
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:46,244
Winners end up with the idol.
Losers end up in the pit."

329
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,831
>> I think we'll win,
and if we don't, who cares?

330
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,001
There's a lot of people
we got to get rid of.

331
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,880
Nobody heard me say that.
>> That sounds great.

332
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,591
>> That's fun, I mean...
>> Yeah, this is gonna be fun.

333
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,511
>> Thus far, our mantra has
been, "slow and steady wins the

334
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,846
race."
It's served us well.

335
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,893
We came in second place.
Second place now sends you home.

336
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:24,866
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!
First things first.

337
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,830
Lex, I will take one half of
the immunity idol, put it with

338
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,249
the other half that I
retrieved from Saboga,

339
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,210
which is no more.
We now have one idol.

340
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:38,714
One winner, one loser.
All right, for today's Immunity

341
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,717
Challenge, both tribes
must navigate their way

342
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,011
along a series
of narrow balance beams

343
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,555
to retrieve tribe-colored flags
from the opposite end

344
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,016
of the course.
In the middle is a battle

345
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,184
bridge.
When two opposing tribe members

346
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,562
meet on opposite ends
of the bridge, it is

347
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,732
a physical showdown.
Your goal, get the other tribe

348
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,567
member off that bridge
and into the water.

349
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,361
The first person to hit the
water returns to the start,

350
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,238
forfeits their flag.
Winner moves on.

351
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,782
A tribe can only have
two members on the course

352
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,659
at any time.
You got to retain

353
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,245
a revolving order.
The first tribe to get 20 flags

354
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,122
from one side to the other
wins immunity,

355
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,751
guaranteed a one-in-13 shot
at a million dollars.

356
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:24,426
Take a spot on your platform,
wait for my go.

357
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,096
Here we go.
For immunity...

358
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,806
survivors ready?
Go!

359
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,933
>> Let's go, Hatch.
>> PROBST: Big Tom and Hatch

360
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,269
on the course.
Shii Ann, Amber on the course.

361
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,646
Hatch having a little trouble,
causing a roadblock.

362
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,440
>> Good job.
>> Go, Tom.

363
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,358
Take your time, Tom.
>> PROBST: Amber, Amber,

364
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,319
Amber, Amber, look at that.
Nice!

365
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,113
>> Close, Amber.
>> Come on there, Amber.

366
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:51,286
>> Nice, Shii Ann,
very nice.

367
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,623
>> Nice job, guys.
>> Nice job, Hatch.

368
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,917
>> PROBST: Hatch has a flag.
He's got to get back.

369
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,628
>> Come on, Tommy.
>> Go get him, Tom.

370
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,755
( yells )
>> PROBST: Hatch is down.

371
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,715
Drop the flag,
and go to the start.

372
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,967
>> Take your time, take your
time, Tom, relax.

373
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,928
Take your time, Tom.
>> Come on, Tom, get across,

374
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,930
get across now.
>> Go all the way across, Tom.

375
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,516
Come on! Tom, bring the flag.
>> Bring the flag.

376
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,935
>> PROBST: Big Tom wanted a
showdown, Ethan not interested.

377
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,020
>> All the way across, Tom.
Come on, Tom...

378
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,689
>> Oh, Shii Ann takes
a dip in the water.

379
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,650
Drop the flag,
head back to the start.

380
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,819
>> You can do it.
>> Good job.

381
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,697
>> PROBST: Big Tom with a flag.
>> Come on, Amber, good job.

382
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,158
>> PROBST: Amber with a flag.
Chapera up 2-0.

383
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,369
Boston Rob waiting
for a showdown.

384
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,454
He has planted it
at the battle bridge.

385
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,499
We have our first showdown.
Here's how it's going to work.

386
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,211
You'll both come out
into the middle of the bridge.

387
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,131
I'm going to say,
"Three, two, one, go."

388
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:48,260
On "go," you go.
Three, two, one, go.

389
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,178
( shouting )
>> Go, Ethan!

390
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,888
Let's go, Ethan!
Come on, baby!

391
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,057
>> PROBST: The first one to hit
the water's out.

392
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,353
Boston Rob hit the water first.
Ethan took a big header

393
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,523
on the side of the pool.
>> Ethan, are you okay?

394
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,526
>> PROBST: You all right?
>> Good job, Easy.

395
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,195
>> PROBST: Ethan, you hop up
here on the platform.

396

Boston Rob's back at the start.
Rupert, back to the start.

397
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,662
Balance, a very big part
of this challenge.

398
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,957
>> All right, Ethan.
>> Ethan with the first flag

399
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,711
for Mogo Mogo.
It's Chapera two, Mogo Mogo one.

00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,935
of David and Goliath?
>> PROBST: Here we go.

405
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,230
Three, two, one, go.
>> Beat him, Jenna.

00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,232
Come on, Jenna.
Go for his feet.

407
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,735
Don't let him get you.

00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,678

>> Yeah, we don't, Richard.
>> Come on, Alicia.

434
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,154
You're doing great now.
Just cruise it.

Cruise it, Alicia, cruise it.

>> PROBST: We have a showdown.

437
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,715
West Coast versus East Coast.

Head back to the start.
Boston Rob is out of control.

446
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,702
He has a flag,
and he's heading back.

447
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,912
>> Come on, Rob.
>> Take your time, Rob.

448
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,914
Take your time.
>> Careful, Rob,

449
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,334
we need those flags.
Boston Rob, no trouble.

450
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,127
>> Be careful.
>> I'm jumping off,

451
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,379
so Rob can go on.
>> Okay.

452
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,631

another flag for Mogo Mogo.

453

Rob in with the 18th flag.
Strategy coming into play.

454
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,264
Most of the Chapera tribe
falling off,

455
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,059
so Rob can run the course.
Boston Rob going

456
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,604
for Chapera's final leg.
>> Come on, you got it,

457
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,231
bring it home!
Mogo Mogo going to have

458
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,859
to engage in battle,
or Chapera's going to walk away

459
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,611
with this.
>> Come on, Rob.

460
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,572
Boston Rob versus Kathy.
>> Go low, go low!

461
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:42,577
Three, two, one, go.
Kathy, good strategy.

462
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,913
>> Rob, you got to do
the same thing.

463
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,958
>> Do the same thing,
Rob, get down.

464
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,418
>> Come on, Rob.
Nice!

465
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,837
>> There we go!

>> No! No! No! No! No! No!

468

Chapera.

469
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,891
Boston Rob has the winning flag.
Go!

470
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,227
Chapera wins immunity.
( cheering )

471
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,315
>> You did it!
>> Good strategy.

472
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,820
( shouting )
>> PROBST: Chapera, immunity.

473
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,615
Safe from Tribal Council.
( cheering )

474
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,617
Mogo Mogo,
Tribal Council tonight.

475
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,619
Won't be the first time
you've lost a member.

476
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,955
It will be the first time
you're voting out a member.

477
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,457
You have this afternoon to think
about who that's going to be.

478
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,377
I'll see you there.
Head on back.

479
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,527
>> Those guys were freaking out.
Did you hear Richard?

480
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,529
He whined.
>> Yeah, they were like,

481
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,281
"They're jumping,
they're jumping.

482
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,949
Everybody's jumping!"
>> "Look, they're all

483
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,285
just jumping off."
>> You call it what you want to,

484
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,036
we call it winning.
>> Yeah, hell, yeah.

485
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,831
Some of us got no balance.
>> I hope they vote Richard off,

486
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,000
'cause what he did to
me was absolutely...

487
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,878
>> That was disgusting.
( all talking )

488
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,338
>> I wanted to get past,
so I wouldn't have to

489
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,048
battle Richard naked.
It felt real good to be able

490
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,676
to propel my team to the win.
And I may not be

491
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,760
as strong as some of them,
but I guarantee I'm tougher

492
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,014
than every single one of them.
>> Welcome to reality.

493
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,017
And you got Colby in.
( shouting )

494
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,186
>> You got him.
>> Colby?

495
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,315
Yeah, he's not as tough
as you think, ladies.

496
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,736
>> Chapera!
( cheering )

497
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:52,832
>> We lost the challenge, and,
uh, it was... it was a blow.

498
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,044
I really like our tribe, and now
we have to go to Tribal.

499
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:01,674
So... the game is on.
For the first time at Mogo

500
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:06,471
Mogo, the game is really on.
>> Oh, it's a downer.

501
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,640
But I also don't like
sitting around the camp

502
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,391
talking about
would have, could have,

503
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,894
should have.
You know, it's time

504
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,355
to move on.
>> Yeah.

505
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,524
>> This is a game where
the more you strategize

506
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,234
and the more
you think about it,

507
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,903
the more you change your mind.
Because a lot of times,

508
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,738
your gut will tell you
something totally different

509
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:26,115
than what you've
already agreed to do.

510
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,368
So, basically
here's where we are--

511
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,578
Richard's the one
we got to get rid of.

512
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,539
He's the snake in the grass...
>> I agree.

513
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,541
>> ...that's gonna cause us
the most trouble.

514
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,252
He's just... he's a cancer
in this tribe, and he's going.

515
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,213
If you give Richard time enough,
he will fester and then

516
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,590
he will spread, you know?
>> But do you think

517
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,760
he's strong enough to keep
around for more challenges?

518
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,887
>> No. No.
We can do without him.

519
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,557
Um... the cool thing is,
he thinks we're dropping

520
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,105
you tonight, so, we're just
going to let him think that,

521
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,941
okay?
>> The plan tonight is

522
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,111
to vote off Richard Hatch.
For all I know, they're going

523
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,280
to vote me off.
You know, I'm super paranoid,

524
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,575
but, um...
I think I got a 50-50 shot.

525
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,549
>> Okay?
>> All right.

526
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:29,637
>> I was approached by...
Lex, Colby and Ethan

527
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,473
to vote for Rich.
I immediately said,

528
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:37,186
"Hell, yeah, count me in."
But the downside is,

529
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,689
it doesn't make any sense
for me to team up with

530
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,650
three guys who are then going
to kick my ass

531
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:52,702
in every challenge afterwards.
>> He just took off to go...

532
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:58,166
in every challenge afterwards.
>> He just took off to go...

533
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,460
>> Get clams.
>> Clamming, yeah.

534
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,129
>> What's his thought?
>> Well, I said, "I can't tell

535
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,340
you "you're going home tonight,
but I can't tell you

536
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,216
you're not, either."
You know, you showed

537
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,968
in those challenges
how dominant you are

538
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,137
as a swimmer and runner
and everything else.

539
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,306
There's no question nobody wants
to compete with you.

540
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,350
>> Right.
>> So I guess I got

541
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,185
to go with you, I
got to believe you.

542
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,854
I got to believe you're with me,
'cause Ethan would be more

543
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:22,899
of a physical threat
to you.

544
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,764
>> When Ethan and Jerri
joined our tribe,

545
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:58,559
we all agreed that Ethan
would be the first to go.

546
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,896
Now all of a sudden,
Lex is coming up to me and Kathy

547
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:06,359
and telling us it's Richard.
Richard. Richard Hatch.

548
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:10,571
It's a mistake.
I think... it's a mistake.

549
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,032
If we take Richard out now,
who do we have?

550
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,743
Just you and me.
>> Well, we got to think

551
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,579
about it some more.
I need to think before I react.

552
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:24,252
We got to think more.
>> What do you think

553
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,878
about all this craziness
that's going on?

554
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,922
>> I know.
>> I mean, if we vote

555
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,425
Colby, I'm in.
>> I know you are.

556
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,470
>> I'm trying to convince Kathy
that instead of Rich, it's

557
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,725
Colby.
My own personal reasons.

558
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,228
Some revenge involved, for sure.
I got screwed over by

559
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,397
Colby once already.
>> I totally see it.

560
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,816
>> I mean, worse than you
could ever imagine,

561
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,111
and I would hate to put
myself in a position

562
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,280
to repeat the same mistake.
>> The only thing that

563
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,823
bothered me today
with this decision,

564
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,783
it wasn't unilateral.
You know, Colby didn't come

565
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,618
to all of us.
He just went up there

566
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,162
and made that decision.
>> Yeah, and that's

567
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,955
exactly what I mean.
>> I don't know,

568
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,166
it's a hard call.
It's a big move.

569
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,959
>> Okay, if you start
thinking differently,

570
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,794
just let me know.
>> I will.

571
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,464
>> I'm on your side.
>> Okay, same here.

572
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:16,053
( laughs )
>> I don't want to fall prey

573
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:21,642
to the same person who
screwed me over in Australia.

574
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,570
>> Time for a Tribal Council,
and everything starts

575
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,156
going haywire-- it's great.
>> See, everything's flushing

576
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,825
out right now.
>> Now Jerri says she's been

577
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,038
approached to get rid of me.
The only way that could possibly

578
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:46,501
have happened
is Ethan, Lex and Colby.

579
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:51,380
>> I think, if we go in,
we vote for Colby, I'm in.

580
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,217
I'm in 100%.
>> Okay, that's it, then.

581
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,885
'Cause if you're not
for anything else,

582
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,513
then we'll just do that.
All right, Colby goes.

583
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,183
So they blew it.
How dare you approach somebody

584
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,853
to get rid of me?
You must go bye-bye now.

585
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:13,694
So Colby has to go home.
( thunder crashing )

586
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,866
>> Well, Ethan and Lex and Colby
feel like they're the strongest

587
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,077
and will hold the
challenges together.

588
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,665
So what do you say-- Colby?
You don't know yet?

589
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,750
You're going to let me
know when you decide.

590
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,919
>> I know.
Give me ten minutes.

591
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,588
>> All right.
( chuckles )

592
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:40,388
( mimics giggling )
>> Colby and Richard are

593
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:45,351
on the chopping block tonight,
and I have got myself

594
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:50,356
in the middle.
I don't know how I got there.

595
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,401
So do you trust your gut?
Do you trust loyalty?

596
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:58,281
Or do you just go with
sort of what makes sense?

597
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,617
And where am I going?
I don't know.

598
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:33,441
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal
Council.

599
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,693
This is the first time
the original Mogo Mogo

600
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,446
has had to deal with the task
of voting somebody out.

601
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,740
Before we get to that,
let's talk a little bit.

602
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,117
Going back to the
Reward Challenge,

603
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,745
Richard, that raft
didn't look like

604
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,997
it was going to make it
three feet in the water.

605
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,958
>> Come on, you knew we were
going to win as soon as you saw

606
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,960
that bundle of joy.
>> PROBST: That was Bad News

607
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,962
Bears for sure.
As a result, you get

608
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,256
two new tribe members.
Ethan, you were the first person

609
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,592
picked in the school yard "Pick
'Em. "

610
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,094
Was your initial instinct,
"Hey, they like me,"

611
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,806
or "Wow, I'm in trouble"?
>> A little bit of both.

612
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,976
But as you know, you remember
that first Tribal Council,

613
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,687
my back was against the wall,
so I was just happy

614
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,440
to have a change of pace
and, you know, just get

615
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:18,486
a new lease on life, really.
>> PROBST: Colby, how are you

616
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,988
doing second time around?
>> I mean, it is

617
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,490
a much different experience
because everyone

618
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,869
knows how to play this game,
and so you cannot coast, uh,

619
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,122
although a lot of people
are doing it.

620
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:34,001
>> PROBST: Kathy,
how much more difficult is it

621
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,295
playing with 18 people
who are really good

622
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,632
at this game?
>> Oh, it's 100% the other

623
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,676
direction than when we were
playing before.

624
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,762
There was loyalty the last time,
you know, where you'd get

625
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,390
friendships and bondings.
And, uh, right now

626
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:52,186
it's just pure unadulterated
playing the game.

627
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,563
>> PROBST: Hatch, how busy was
the afternoon back at camp,

628
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,857
because it's game on now.
For the first time,

629
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,610
you have to vote somebody out.
>> Yeah, it's true.

630
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,696
This is our first time
somebody's got to go.

631
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,657
Of course, you know,
I have no target on my back.

632
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,326
( blows air thorough lips )
( Richard chuckles )

633
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,578
>> PROBST: Colby, what
went on at camp this afternoon

634
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,914
when you got back?
It had to be a busy

635
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,916
afternoon, positioning.
>> It was. Yeah, it was.

636
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,876
It was.
It's a hard day when

637
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,170
you got to go back,
and you have a few

638
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,172
hours to scramble.
Ultimately,

639
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,050
someone's getting duped.
Someone is having the wool

640
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,053
pulled over their eyes, and...
( chuckles )

641
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,557
you won't know until that vote
goes up whether it's you.

642
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,851
>> PROBST: What are you basing
your vote on tonight?

643
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,228
>> Um, cutting out the cancer.
>> PROBST: How about for you,

644
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,856
Kathy?
>> Taking the big players

645
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,858
out--taking the power players
out.

646
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,569
>> PROBST: Surprised who you're
voting for?

647
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,572
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: And with that,

648
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:50,745
it's time to vote.
Ethan, you're up.

649
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,928
>> It does come down to this.
You really could have trusted

650
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,931
me.
I was... I was on your side.

651
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:16,270
I know that's hard to believe,
but it's true.

652
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,913
>> Hatch, you're a hell of
a player and you almost had me

653
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,624
convinced I can trust you.
But my gut told me not to.

654
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,669
I'm not going to.
Best of luck.

655
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,063
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

656
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,661
>> PROBST: Once the votes are
read, the decision is final.

657
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,996
The person voted out
will be asked to leave the

658
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,500
Tribal Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

659
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:27,133
First vote:
Colby.

660
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:33,347
Hatch.
Rich.

661
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,644
Two votes: Rich.
One vote: Colby.

662
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,730
Hatch.
That's three votes: Rich.

663
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:47,403
One vote: Colby.
The fifth person voted out

664
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:51,740
of<i> Survivor: All-Stars...</i>
Rich.

665
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,826
>> I've been bamboozled!
>> PROBST: That's four.

666
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,913
That's enough.
>> Good on you all.

667
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:02,293
Man, oh, man.
>> We played it, didn't we?

668
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,880
>> ( chuckles ): Yeah, you did.
>> PROBST: Rich, the tribe

669
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,634
has spoken.
>> Food. Food.

670
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,856
>> PROBST: Well, if tonight's
vote showed you one thing,

671
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,483
it ought to be this:
when you are competing

672
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,111
against players
of this caliber in this game,

673
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,071
it doesn't matter
how good you are,

674
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,908
you are always at risk.
Grab your torches,

675
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,452
head back to camp.
Good night.

681
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,142
My strategy was pointed out
by Colby last night.

682
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,770
Someone like you doesn't have
to lie this entire game because

683
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,647
you don't make a decision.
I don't have

684
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,732
any respect for that.
>> Captain America with his

685
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,944
good teeth, blah, blah, blah.
>> PROBST: And Sue speaks out.

686
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,614
It wasn't "sort of," Jeff!
I was humiliated and totally

687
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:21,956
spent, Jeff!
>> Oops!

688
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,500
( laughs )
So much for what I thought.

689
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,962
I'm gone.
How much fun is<i> Survivor?</i>

690
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,297
Yeah, I was blown out
of the water today

691
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,633
and didn't even know it.
I've never had my torch snuffed.

692
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,261
I've never had it put out,
and here I am, I'm gone.

693
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,680
I'm gone.
Oh, fifth out of the game.

694
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,891
I wanted the check again.
Damn.
