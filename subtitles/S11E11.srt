00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,169
<i>Survivor...</i> Jamie had it out

3
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,796
with Gary.

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,588
>> You are calling me a liar,

5
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,381
and I don't like that.

6
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,382
>> I did not just call you a

7
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:07,716
liar.

8
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,299
>> Well, obviously, me and you

9
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,217
are going to have to fight this

10
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,218
whole thing now.

11
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,721
>> PROBST: The next day, the

12
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,805
tribe learned they would compete

13
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,390
for a night away from camp.

14
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,224
The winning team will leave here

15
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,059
via helicopter to a beautiful

16
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,729
private home.

17
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,271
The tribe was split into two

18
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,857
teams of four.

19
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,650
Survivors ready, go!

20
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,276
Lydia, Cindy, Jamie, and Rafe's

21
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,695
team took an early lead.

22
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,320
Gary and Judd trying to hang on.

23
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,533
But Lydia couldn't keep up.

>> I can't get my feet up.

25
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,744
Steph and Danni surged ahead and

26
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,620
won reward for their team.

00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,747
(<i> cheering</i> )

28
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,665
Danni, Steph, Gary, Judd win

29
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,709
reward!

30
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,127
Living in luxury, Danni, Steph,

31
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,128
and Gary bonded.

32
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,171
>> Danni and I are, like, really

33
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,047
similar.

34
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,632
She's a cool chick.

35
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,508
>> Two hot girls get in the

36
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,676
shower together.

37
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,302
>> I wouldn't go that far, not

38
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,219
right now.

39
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,637
>> PROBST: And Gary took the

40
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,722
opportunity to make his move.

41
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,931
>> I want to take the strongest

42
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,767
four to the final four.

43
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,309
Because if Lydia goes to the

44
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,728
final two, guess who's winning?

45
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,854
>> We know that.

46
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,938
>> If Cindy goes to the final

47
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,481
two, guess who's winning?

48
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,274
And do they deserve it?

49
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,484
>> Let me ask you this, then.

50
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,443
Numbers aside, who would be the

51
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,194
next person you guys would want

52
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,987
to vote out?

53
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,905
>> Jamie.

54
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,906
>> PROBST: But Judd wasn't

55
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,783
buying into Gary's plea.

56
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,910
>> Bonding with Gary and Danni

57
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,702
is not going to affect my game,

58
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,120
because I know what my game plan

59
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:19,788
is.

60
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,206

Go!

62
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,876
The race for immunity was tight.

63
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,752
It's Cindy and Rafe right now.

64
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,920
But it was Rafe who came away

65
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,922
with the victory.

66
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,090
Rafe wins immunity.

70
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,803
looming, Judd reassured Jamie

71
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,138
that Gary was the next to go.

72
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,515

00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,933

76
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,894
Jamie's just very paranoid.

77
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:43,686
I mean, he's not going anywhere.

78
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,354
>> PROBST: But Lydia, Stephenie,

79
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,773
and Rafe were conspiring against

80
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,775
Jamie behind Judd's back.

81
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,403

82
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,780
Gary is a smooth operator.

83
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:57,116
>> I think we should do it.

84
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,909
>> I don't know what to say, you

85
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:58,827

00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,291
Judd was surprised to see his

90
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,963

Me, Judd, and Steph are pretty

192
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,225
confident in each other at this

193
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,476
point.

194
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,477
And I think Gary and Danni have

195
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,770
managed to pull over Lydia in a

196
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,605
real way.

197
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,530
>> When we went on our reward,

198
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,365
Gary had told me that he wanted

199
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,741
Cindy and Lydia out of this game

200
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,410
already and they shouldn't even

201
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,244
be here.

202
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,328
Okay, now he wants them in the

203
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,454
game, and he's trying to make an

204
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:35,872
alliance with them.

205
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,664
So that's a big lie.

206
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,542
He likes to think that he's no

207
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,002
part of this lying game, but the

208
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,337
least person you would expect to

209
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,589
lie is basically the biggest

210
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,593
liar.

211
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,640
I need a tad bit more.

212
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,601
>> What is your strategy here?

213
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,060
>> Okay, okay.

214
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:58,603
>> I mean, because we got to

215
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:03,065
have four, so that's why I

216
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,650
wanted to talk to you, because

217
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,527
I'd rather go with you than some

218
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:06,736
of them.

219
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,988
>> I'm going with you, but the

220
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,489
thing is, the thing is...

221
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,743
you know, I, I wasn't sure about

222
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,203
Cindy.

223
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,996
Stephenie, Judd, Rafe, Cindy,

224
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,956
and myself, we're all in this

225
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,624
together now, final five, but

226
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,792
the thing is I have to cover my

227
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,669
own ass, you know.

228
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,545
I'm going to have to see how far

229
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,047
this game is going to take me.

230
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:26,672
So if somebody approach me with

231
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,673
a better deal, I'm going with

232
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:32,637
it.

233
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,394
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

234
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,312
How's everybody doing?

235
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,188
>> Good.

236
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,064
>> Good.

237
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,065
>> PROBST: Shall we get to

238
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:44,690
today's challenge?

239
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,025
Today's challenge is for reward.

240
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,693
Each of you will have three pots

241
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,612
filled with corn.

242
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm going to ask you a series of

243
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,782
questions about the Maya culture

244
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,658
and Guatemala.

245
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,617
Each time you answer a question

246
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,661
correctly, you earn the right to

247
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,704
smash another tribe member's pot

248
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,540
of corn.

249
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,541
When all three of your pots are

250
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,793
smashed, you're out of the game.

251
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,878
Last person with a pot left

252
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,712
hanging wins reward.

253
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,506
Do you want to know what you are

254
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,131
playing for?

255
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:09,882
>> Yeah.

256
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,050
>> PROBST: The winner will leave

257
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:11,634
here and be taken to a true

258
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,720
natural wonder of Guatemala.

259
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,888
>> Wow.

260
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,847
>> PROBST: It's a hot springs

261
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,682
waterfall cascading down into a

262
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,600
pool of cool water.

263
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,352
So when combined, they create

264
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,812
this spa-like environment that

265
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,522
is very relaxing.

266
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,606
You'll have mojitos.

267
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,899
(<i> gasping</i> )

268
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,818
You'll have skewered meat,

269
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,445
shrimp, beef, chicken.

270
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,697
You'll also have a massage.

271
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,823
Worth playing for?

272
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,949
>> Yes.

273
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:39,036
>> Oh, yeah.

274
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,704
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get

275
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,831
started.

276
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,874
First question: the Maya

277
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,667
recorded their stories by

278
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,336
carving hieroglyphics into stone

279
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,756
monuments known as A: Stella, B:

280
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,677
Origami, C: Sanskrit or D: Docky

281
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,557
Rocks.

282
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,184
Everybody reveal.

283
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:02,727
Steph says C: Sanskrit.

284
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,313
That is wrong.

285
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,397
Correct answer is A: Stella.

286
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,107
Everybody else has it right.

287
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,693
All right, Judd, you're up

288
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,736
first, take your swing.

289
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,654
>> Don't do it, Judd.

290
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,155
>> PROBST: Already, the

291
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,990
negotiating begins.

292
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,618
Judd goes right to Gary.

293
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,786
Nothing subtle about that, Gary.

294
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,954
>> No.

295
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,955
>> Lydia.

296
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,458
>> How did I know?

297
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,375
>> PROBST: Wow.

298
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,710
>> How did I know?

299
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,253
>> PROBST: Stephenie down a pot.

300
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,713
Danni.

301
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,506
>> Man.

302
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,174
>> PROBST: Stephenie takes her

303
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:33,966
second hit.

304
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,177
Cindy.

305
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,595
Cindy knocks Gary's second pot

306
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,971
down.

307
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,890
Gary down to one pot.

308
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,266
Stephenie down to one pot.

309
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,268
Rafe moves to Danni, smashes

310
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,479
Danni's first pot.

311
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,732
Gary has two people to pay back.

312
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,900
Gary takes out Cindy.

313
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,111
Next question: in the Maya court

314
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,905
ball game, members of the losing

315
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,074
team were frequently killed.

316
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,117
True or false, often they would

317
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,078
be decapitated and their heads

318
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,787
would then be encased to be used

319
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,792
as the ball in future games.

320
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,797
Everybody reveal.

321
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,798
Steph takes a look down to see

322
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,925
what other people are doing.

323
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,510
Makes her choice, and she makes

324
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,095
the wrong choice.

325
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,138
It is true.

326
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,515
Lydia has it right.

327
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,724
Danni has it right.

328
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,141
Cindy has it right.

329
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:24,809
That's it.

330
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,894
Lydia, take your whack.

331
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,938
Lydia could put somebody out of

332
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,566
this game... and she does.

333
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,776
Steph the first casualty.

334
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,404
>> Jealousy gets you nowhere.

335
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,614
>> I'm hungry. I want to eat.

336
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,615
>> We'll see about that.

337
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,117
>> PROBST: Steph not happy at

338
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,992
all with that, Lydia.

339
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,953
>> I haven't eaten.

340
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,121
Steph ate three times.

341
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,914
>> So did Gary, so did Danni.

342
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,958
>> PROBST: Game's getting

343
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,584
interesting.

344
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,087
Danni, take your shot.

345
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,089
Judd takes his first hit.

346
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,757
Cindy, what's she going to do?

347
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:01,095
Boy, she's winding up.

348
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:01,846
Wow.

349
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,973
Cindy takes Gary out of the

350
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,974
game.

351
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,725
Gary not happy.

352
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,893
Just like that, we're down to

353
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,894
five.

354
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,229
Next question, the ancient Maya

355
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,189
believed that the gods fashioned

356
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,899
man from which spiritually

357
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,112
important crop, A: Coffee, B:

358
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,323
Cocoa Beans, C: Corn, or D:

359
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,992
Ramon Nuts.

360
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,119
Judd trying to see any clue of

361
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,579
what to put down.

362
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,416
Everybody reveal.

363
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,127
Judd says, B: Cocoa Beans.

364
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,753
No, the correct answer was C:

365
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,921
Corn.

366
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,008
Everybody else has it right.

367
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,135
Judd takes his second hit.

368
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,761
Danni could put Judd out of

369
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,971
this, and she does.

370
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,183
Judd takes a seat on the bench.

371
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,811
Cindy heading down to the end.

372
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,271
Danni now down to one pot.

373
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,981
Rafe could take her out, and he

374
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,024
does.

375
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:55,816
>> Come join the loser's lounge.

376
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,027
>> PROBST: Danni takes a seat on

377
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,819
the bench.

378
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,820
We are now down to three.

379
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,281
Lydia has all three pots left.

380
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,908
Rafe has all three pots left.

381
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,784
Cindy has two pots left.

382
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,827
Which of the following countries

383
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:12,166
does not border Guatemala, A: is

384
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,961
Belize, B: Honduras, C: Costa

385
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,006
Rica, D: El Salvador.

386
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,925
Everybody reveal.

387
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,511
Correct answer, Rafe has it, C:

388
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,845
Costa Rica.

389
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,307
Take your shot.

390
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,059
Rafe breaks Lydia's first pot.

391
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,061
Lydia and Cindy down to two

392
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,062
pots.

393
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,396
Rafe still has all three.

394
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,106
True or false: the temples of

395
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,818
Tikal are the only ancient Maya

396
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,320
structures to be built during

397
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,488
the Maya Empire with the aid of

398
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,073
modern machinery.

399
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,867
Reveal.

400
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,619
Everybody says false.

401
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,995
I'm so glad everybody got it

402
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,996
right.

403
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,622
There was no modern machinery in

404
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,998
ancient Maya.

405
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,335
Cindy, you're up.

406
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,046
Big decision now.

407
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,548
Does Rafe get his first hit, or

408
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,927
does Lydia take her second?

409
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,262
Cindy knocks Lydia's second pot

410
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,681
out.

411
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,932
And with that, Lydia is out of

412
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,308
the game.

413
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,935
But, Lydia, because you got it

414
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,978
right, you get your last licks.

415
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,063
Two people to pay back, only one

416
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,567
swing to do it with.

417
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,026
Lydia is done.

418
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,653
Does her damage, takes a seat on

419
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,654
the bench.

420
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,364
We are now down to two.

421
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,116
Big reward at stake.

422
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,285
Both of you have two pots left.

423
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,078
True or false: there are 30

424
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:35,708
volcanoes here in Guatemala.

425
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,085
Reveal.

426
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,712
Rafe says false, Cindy says

427
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,171
true.

428
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,172
Correct answer is...

429
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:42,965
true.

430
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,009
Cindy got it right.

431
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,095
>> Wow.

432
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,264
>> PROBST: Just like that, Rafe

433
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:50,973
is down to one pot.

434
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,809
If Cindy gets it right,

435
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,060
regardless what you do, Cindy

436
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,478
wins.

437
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,480
True or false: the most active

438
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,399
time of day for crocodiles is at

439
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,484
dawn.

440
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,155
Reveal.

441
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:06,488
Rafe says true.

442
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,158
Cindy says false.

443
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,620
Crocodiles are most active not

444
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,288
at dawn, but at dusk.

445
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,748
The answer is false.

446
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,832
>> Cindy!

447
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,043
Whoo!

448
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,547
>> PROBST: So here is the deal.

449
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,840
You are going to leave here, go

450
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,508
to a beautiful place.

451
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,302
Got some food, got some drink,

452
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,803
got a massage.

453
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,387
You got one person going with

454
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,639
you.

455
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,223
(<i> groans</i> )

456
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,227
>> This is the most difficult

457
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,062
decision of the whole game.

458
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,980
Judd's sitting over there

459
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,023
praying.

460
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,234
(<i> laughter</i> )

461
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,863
>> PROBST: Pick one.

462
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,156
>> I'll go with Rafe.

463
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,116
>> PROBST: Rafe is going.

464
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,368
Cindy and Rafe, heading off to a

465
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,620
great reward.

466
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,163
Steph, Judd, Lydia, Danni, Gary,

467
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,833
head on back to camp.

468
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,852
>> We get to the challenge, and,

469
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,020
lo and behold, I'm the first

470
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:20,229
one out.

471
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,064
Lydia hits me twice.

472
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:22,481
Danni hits me once.

473
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,274
Knocked me right out.

474
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,234
Lydia was fed up because I've

475
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,027
won so many food rewards, and

476
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,237
she's starving out here.

477
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,406
Well, boo-hoo for Lydia.

478
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,490
I'm sick of hearing your crap.

479
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,366
You're lucky you're still in the

480
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,450
game.

481
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,118
I just want to say, just to get

482
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,371
it out there, I had burgers,

483
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,582
burgers, burgers.

484
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,917
Feast, feast, you had pizza, you

485
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,167
had pasta.

486
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,794
>> The only one that didn't eat

487
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,753
here was Lydia.

488
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,797
>> We've all had three, and then

489
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,840
I chose, personally, not to

490
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,007
compete in the immunity

491
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,258
challenge.

492
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,175
I put my ass on the line, and I

493
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,219
ate, so I had one extra, and

494
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,303
that was not a reward.

495
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,096
'Cause everybody is talking,

496
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,097
"Stephenie's eating so much.

497
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,515
I'm so upset Stephenie is

498
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,558
winning all these rewards."

499
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,392
>> I wasn't...

500
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,184
>> And I don't want to hear

501
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,102
anymore about it.

502
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,478
There's a winner and a loser in

503
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,438
this game, and if you're gonna

504
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,647
be jealous, then you're an

505
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,440
idiot.

506
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,107
I made that clear as soon as I

507
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,108
got back to camp.

508
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,192
I shut everybody up right then

509
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:07,443
and there.

510
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,193
You think that a challenge like

511
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,194
this isn't going to show me

512
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,195
where your loyalties lie, you

513
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,196
are sadly mistaken.

514
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,197
I've had three, you've had

515
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,198
three, you've had three, you've

516
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,199
had three.

517
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,200
We're all pretty even.

518
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,201
>> Which I don't care, one way

519
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:16,535
or the other.

520
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,370
But a pizza compared to what you

521
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,247
ate was nothing.

522
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,875
Lydia was very upset because

523
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,836
Steph eats a stinking ton.

524
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,212
I don't think she's lost weight.

525
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,380
She eats so much corn and nuts

526
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,007
it's amazing.

527
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,760
So I know she is strong.

528
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,385
And she needs to be looked at at

529
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,137
these challenges, 'cause she can

530
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,637
win.

531
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,638
>> I'm not going to take

532
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,765
anything personal, I'm not, but

533
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,057
when I hear people saying that

534
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:39,641
I've eaten too much and that

535
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,893
they're starving and that I get

536
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,061
all the rewards, I just want to

537
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,438
set the record straight that

538
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,773
we're pretty damn even now.

539
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,815
>> This wasn't personal.

540
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,067
If I won, I was going to take

541
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,402
Rafe, because I felt Rafe and I

542
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,487
were the only two that hadn't

543
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,488
had a meal, and that was the

544
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,364
only reason why.

545
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,240
>> Everything in this game is

546
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,408
personal, man.

547
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,993
I mean, I hear people, I see

548
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,620
people every day lying through

549
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,663
their damn teeth who I least

550
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,665
expect to lie, so when you say

551
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,000
nothing is personal, everything

552
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:05,375
is personal, man.

553
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,127
>> Stephenie was the first one

554
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,253
out, and I think she was pretty

555
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,088
upset.

556
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,256
I wanted to give somebody else a

557
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,592
chance for the food reward that

558
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,095
hadn't had a chance, you know?

559
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,679
Right now, everybody is putting

560
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,222
Stephenie up on a pedestal.

561
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,934
Everybody is knowing that

562
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,811
Stephenie is the biggest threat,

563
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,686
but nobody is doing anything

564
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,854
about it.

565
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,231
>> Well, I'm glad that's over,

566
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,440
and if you think I'm eating too

567
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,399
much or getting too many

568
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,651
rewards, just tell me next time,

569
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,485
because I'm going to hear about

570
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:36,573
it.

571
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,414
>> This is amazing.

572
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,457
>> Hola.

573
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,251
>> Oh, my gosh, it's beautiful.

574
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,168
>> I'm just, like, completely

575
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,420
ecstatic that I actually won a

576
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,840
reward, a really cool reward.

577
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,258
And I couldn't have picked a

578
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,593
better person to share it with.

579
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,602
>><i> Oh, gracias.</i>

580
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,687
>> There was this gorgeous

581
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,272
waterfall and then a huge

582
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,774
platter of shishkabobs and

583
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,316
mojito pitchers and then a

584
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,694
massage table.

585
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,486
We were like, "Do we eat first?

586
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,654
Do we get massages?

587
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,530
What do we do?"

588
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,447
And, of course, we decided to

589
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,657
eat first, because, I mean, we

590
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,118
had to.

591
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:21,702
To the first of many feasts

592
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,539
and exotic locations together.

593
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,750
>> Cheers.

594
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,168
>> We have to eat all of this.

595
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,545
>> Look, watermelon.

596
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,505
Oh, this is so freakin' good.

597
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,382
>> I just can't believe we're

598
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:35,591
eating.

599
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,677
>> So, back at camp, Lydia is

600
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,554
probably really irritated that

601
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,598
she's not eating.

602
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,266
Gary is mad because I took him

603
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:44,433
out.

604
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,685
Stephenie and Judd are probably

605
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,769
sitting up on the ruins laughing

606
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,520
at it all.

607
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,479
>> Mm-hmm.

608
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,189
>> Lydia is so easily swayed.

609
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,691
>> Spending too much time with

610
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,358
Gary, getting brainwashed.

611
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,819
>> It was kind of like a flood

612
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,696
of strategy out of both of us.

613
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,615
After that, it was like, you

614
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,949
know, Cindy and I are kind of in

615
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,034
this together for better or

616
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,620
for worse.

617
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,377
>> Oh, you can feel the warm

618
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,837
water-- come on.

619
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,506
The water coming down out of the

620
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,133
waterfall was hot, not warm, hot

621
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,010
like taking-a-shower hot.

622
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,553
And then the water down

623
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,472
underneath was cold, and it was

624
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,016
crystal clear.

625
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,517
It was one of the coolest things

626
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:32,648
you could possibly see.

627
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,191
>> We went into the waterfall

628
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,525
together.

629
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,568
You know, I was holding her and

630
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,319
helping her move.

631
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,654
And I am a really touchy person,

632
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,614
and Cindy is not, so it was nice

633
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,366
to kind of be able to, like,

634
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,242
feel that touchy-feely kind of

635
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,871
connection with Cindy.

636
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,754
>> It feels really, really good,

637
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,172
like every muscle in my entire

638
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:03,720
body is loose and relaxed.

639
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,347
I've not been that relaxed in,

640
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,765
you know, over a month.

641
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,225
And it was icing on the cake.

642
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,309
That was awesome, huh?

643
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,394
>> This was, like, the best day

644
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,437
ever.

645
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,189
It was just such an amazing

646
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,649
experience to be in the

647
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,567
waterfall, and to have the food,

648
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,402
and to have the massage.

649
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,821
>> I'm so relaxed I can't even

650
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,114
get my shoes on my feet.

651
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:22,823
>> Mm-hmm.

652
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,449
That reward was just like, I can

653
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,659
make it, for the rest of this

654
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,785
game.

655
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:31,915
We can do this.

656
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,338
>> Aren't you thirsty?

657
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,006
>> Yeah.

658
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:39,548
>> This makes me thirsty.

659
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,091
>> I'm always thirsty.

660
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,217
>> Lydia, can you bring that

661
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,551
pitcher over?

662
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,343
>> Yeah.

663
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,679
>> Are you done with that cup?

664
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,556
>> Yeah, clean cup, too.

665
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,807
>> Thank you.

666
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,350
>> Mm-hmm.

667
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,144
>> Hi!

668
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,730
>> Hi, guys!

669
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,397
How was the feast?

670
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,690
>> It was like a plate of

671
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,733
shishkabobs.

672
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,400
It wasn't a ton of food.

673
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,526
Like, we just ate quickly and

674
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,444
then, like, went down and kind

675
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,779
of showered off in the

676
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,363
waterfall.

677
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,364
We came back to camp after the

678
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:04,906
reward challenge, and I was

679
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,533
like, "Uh-oh, who's going to

680
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,784
make us feel comfortable about

681
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,368
what happened?"

682
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,370
>> Tell us from the beginning,

683
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,413
like, when you got there.

684
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,414
>> As soon as you got there,

685
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:12,956
with the platter waiting for

686
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,124
you.

687
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:14,624
>> There was shrimp and

688
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,417
vegetables, and then steak and

689
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,376
vegetables.

690
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,586
>> The shrimp was best.

691
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,754
But it was really nice.

692
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,048
It definitely was relaxing.

693
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,632
>> Good, I'm so glad you guys

694
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,550
got to do that.

695
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,760
>> Cindy and Rafe came back to

696
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,595
camp and they shared the

697
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,555
experience with everybody.

698
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,515
I had to listen to them, you

699
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,391
know, about how good the food

700
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,852
was and the shishkabob, and the

701
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,521
mojitos, and what have you.

702
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,481
I felt insulted.

703
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,440
Cindy should have chosen me to

704
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,817
go to this food reward.

705
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,443
I'm an outcast.

706
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,739
That's what I feel like.

707
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,200
>> Oh.

708
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:48,992
>> Try it?

709
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:49,951
>> No, no, I've had enough food

710
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,535
today.

711
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:50,869
>> Okay, okay.

712
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,495
>> Is it good, though?

713
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,621
Did you put coffee in it?

714
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,248
>> No just water, salt, and the

715
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,249
leftovers that nobody wanted.

716
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,250
>> Oh.

717
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,251
>> I didn't want to throw it

718
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:58,752
away.

719
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,378
>> Lydia had, like, some kind of

720
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,130
corn soup or something in a

721
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,715
little coffee cup eating it

722
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,467
like, you know, she was just

723
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,260
literally dying and she was

724
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:07,803
scrounging for whatever she

725
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,263
could find to eat.

726
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:10,889
And it's almost like, you know,

727
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,474
we're supposed to feel sorry for

728
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,268
you, and let you win something.

729
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,436
But, I mean, we're here to

730
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,396
compete, and we're talking final

731
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,606
four, and you've got to step it

732
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,108
up, or you're not going to be

733
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:21,525
around.

734
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,526
>> We need to stick together, us

735
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,111
four.

736
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,447
>> I think so, too.

737
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:27,989
>> Because she's nice and

738
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:33,912
smiles.

739
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:34,621
>> This next couple of days are

740
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,497
going to be crucial for Lydia,

741
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,833
'cause it could mean that she

742
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,458
goes really far in this game or

743
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:43,547
is one of the next people to go.

744
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,684
(<i> snoring</i> )

745
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,354
>> One, two...

746
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,857
>> Any of you making coffee?

747
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,607
>> I am right now.

748
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,317
>> The first couple of hours are

749
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,193
one of the better parts of the

750
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:05,777
day.

751
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,611
We sit around and talk and have

752
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,488
coffee and breakfast.

753
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,198
>> Here she comes.

754
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,616
>> The coffee queen.

755
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,534
>> Stephenie and myself, Judd

756
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,578
and Rafe all had our coffee.

757
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,413
We're up on the ruins, and we

758
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,539
were like, "How cool would it be

759
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,540
if this is the way we spend our

760
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,708
last days?"

761
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,501
>> This corn cake is made all

762
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:21,710
right?

763
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,753
>> Oh, man.

764
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,046
>> I don't know why.

765
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,006
It just seems like every

766
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:26,631
morning, my coffee gets better.

767
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,800
>> There's definitely a foursome

768
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,551
that seems to feel they have the

769
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,803
most power.

770
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,346
I would rather be in the power

771
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,601
class right now, but I'm not.

772
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,069
>> The people I totally feel

773
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,738
comfortable with are you and

774
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,200
Rafe.

775
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,083
>> There's three outsiders.

776
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:02,751
I mean, that's Gary, myself, and

777
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,628
now Lydia, but we need to bring

778
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,670
in a fourth person.

779
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,464
So we're going to try to talk to

780
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,216
Rafe and see what plan of action

781
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,886
we can take.

782
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:13,678
Hopefully, it'll work out.

783
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,597
Otherwise, I've got to look at

784
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,098
who is control of the game and

785
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,516
play up to it.

786
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,809
You just have to keep trying

787
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,811
until you find something that

788
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,063
works, 'cause I'm not going to

789
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:27,817
go home.

790
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:36,701
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

791
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:42,499
Come on in, have a seat.

792
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,792
All right, first things first.

793
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,043
Rafe, hand over the immunity

794
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,419
necklace.

795
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,796
Once again, immunity is back up

796
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,838
for grabs.

797
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,465
Today, I'm going to tell you a

798
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,842
story about Maya folklore.

799
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,094
You're then gonna race to a

800
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,137
series of seven stations.

801
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,555
You'll find a puzzle.

802
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,723
Put the puzzle together to

803
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,684
reveal a question about the

804
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,102
story.

805
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,687
Read it and choose between one

806
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,729
of two answers.

807
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,315
If you are right, you'll find

808
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,234
colored flags.

809
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,694
Grab yours, bring it back to

810
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,903
your starting platform, and hang

811
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:12,779
it up.

812
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,780
If you're wrong, you will find

813
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,032
colored sticks.

814
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,701
You must grab your stick, throw

815
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,536
it in the fire before you can go

816
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,370
back to that station or any

817
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,538
other station.

818
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,081
The first person to have all

819
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,499
seven flags hanging from their

820
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,668
starting platform wins immunity.

821
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,545
You ready for the story?

822
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,755
One of the most popular figures

823
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,091
in Mayan mythology is the moon

824
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,968
goddess, Ixchel.

825
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:35,677
She was also the inventor of

826
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,678
weaving.

827
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,887
Ixchel was married to Itzamna.

828
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,347
He was the creator of the entire

829
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,891
Maya culture.

830
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,517
Together, they had four sons.

831
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,060
They were responsible for

832
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,145
holding up the four corners of

833
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,564
the sky, but that marriage

834
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,148
ended, Ixchel married again.

835
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,691
This time she married the earth

836
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,860
god, Voltan.

837
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,777
Voltan was a human hero, who had

838
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,738
been turned into a god.

839
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,156
But after a short while, Ixchel

840
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,574
grew tired of that and began

841
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,742
having an affair with the sun

842
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,701
god.

843
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,496
This frustrated her grandfather.

844
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,122
He threw lightning down on her,

845
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,874
killing her.

846
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,792
But dragonflies sang over her

847
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,001
body.

848
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:08,710
She came back to life, went

849
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,587
right back to the affair she was

850
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,005
having with the sun.

851
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,715
This lasted just a few days, and

852
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,216
she began having another affair

853
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,801
with the sun's brother, the

854
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,511
morning star.

855
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,138
This devastated the sun god.

856
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,806
He banished her from his sight

857
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,891
forever.

858
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,225
Today, Ixchel spends her nights

859
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,894
alone in the sky, nursing the

860
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,562
women of earth through their

861
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,605
pregnancy.

862
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,230
As for the sun, when the sun is

863
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,025
in sight, the moon stays hidden.

864
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,526
That's the story.

865
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,444
We'll draw for spots, and we'll

866
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,405
get started.

867
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,115
Here we go, guys.

868
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:39,783
For immunity.

869
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,826
Survivors ready?

870
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,744
Go!

871
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,662
You get it right, you'll find a

872
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,832
colored flag.

873
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,719

kill her?"

878
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,814
Because she had an affair.

Um, a human.

Gary right behind.

912
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,295
It's Gary and Rafe, each with

two flags.

30 days out here.

930
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,283
Don't want it to end tonight.

Gary has not missed a question

948
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,106
yet.

949
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,816
Danni answers wrong.

950
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,068
Rafe back with his fifth flag.

951
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,027
It's Gary and Rafe with five.

952
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,614
Only two flags left.

953
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,990
Cindy with her fifth flag.

954
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,826
Gary, Rafe, Cindy fighting for

955
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,953
immunity.

956
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,204
>> "A human."

957
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,539
>> Ixchel was the goddess of the

958
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,000
moon.

959
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,043
>> PROBST: Here comes Gary with

960
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,879
his sixth flag.

961
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:44,008
Rafe with his sixth flag.

962
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,552
Rafe and Gary both have one flag

963
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,844
left.

964
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,595
Both have to go to far corners

965
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,015
of the court.

966
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,892
They're still neck and neck.

967
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,185
Gary and Rafe, immunity on the

968
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,020
line.

969
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:56,980
>> "... corners of the sky-- who

970
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,106
was the further?"

971
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,942
>> ...morning star-- true.

972
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,652
>> PROBST: Gary and Rafe both

973
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,736
heading back with their last

974
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,697
flag.

975
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,616
It's going to be a race.

976
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,243
Rafe back with his seventh flag.

977
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,914
Once again, Rafe wins immunity!

978
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:24,674
Rafe, come on over.

979
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,217
Once again, you are safe at

980
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,802
Tribal Council tonight.

981
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:28,303
(<i> applause</i> )

982
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,556
Sadly, everybody else fair game.

983
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,640
One of you will be going home

984
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,391
tonight.

985
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,976
See you guys at Tribal.

986
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,438
Head on back.

987
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,128
>> Good job, everybody.

988
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,254
>> Rafe kicked butt.

989
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,090
>> For the third time, I won

990
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,133
individual immunity.

991
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,176
Who would see this little gay

992
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,386
Mormon and think that he was

993
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,764
going to win most of the

994
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,682
immunity challenges?

995
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,768
It feels really good, because

996
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,227
growing up, I never saw someone

997
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,772
who looked and acted gay and was

998
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,316
also athletic and could... had

999
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,651
confidence in themselves and

1000
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,694
could do well in competitions

1001
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,030
like this.

1002
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:29,906
>> So far, we got a great

1003
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,908
alliance.

1004
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,784
>> Such a good alliance, and we

1005
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,077
all trust each other.

1006
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,286
It's just too funny, because

1007
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,162
it's two guys, two girls.

1008
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,080
How fair is that?

1009
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,332
We started together, you started

1010
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,166
together.

1011
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,125
>> I mean, it's just like...

1012
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,251
>> It's perfect.

1013
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,086
It seems too good to be true.

1014
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,003
We have such a great alliance,

1015
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,881
and we have such trust in one

1016
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:47,757
another that it almost seems too

1017
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,967
easy to get to the final four

1018
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:50,885
together.

1019
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,053
It feels weird because, last

1020
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,889
time, I felt so powerless and

1021
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,516
this time I feel so powerful.

1022
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,684
It's like a dream almost come

1023
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,267
true, but it almost seems too

1024
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:03,856
good to be true.

1025
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,331
>> I thought to myself, "I was

1026
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,499
loyal to you.

1027
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,375
"I was right there with

1028
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,168
everything that you wanted me to

1029
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,128
"do.

1030
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:25,753
And now, all of a sudden, you

1031
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,296
guys don't need me anymore," so

1032
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,259
I think I'm screwed.

1033
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,811
>> Right now, I think I'm a big

1034
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,020
enough threat that they are

1035
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:43,604
going to keep Lydia and Danni

1036
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,815
around instead of me.

1037
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,941
I'm dealing with some smart

1038
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,569
people and people that don't

1039
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,820
want me around.

1040
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,321
Cindy, obviously, doesn't like

1041
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,448
me, so I don't care what happens

1042
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,657
to her.

1043
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,616
But I'm not going to dwell on

1044
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,325
it.

1045
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,326
I'm going to just attack the

1046
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,119
next avenue and see if I can

1047
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,997
just stay in a couple more days.

1048
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,141
>> Good, good.

1049
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,653
>> Rafe told me that he didn't

1050
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,488
trust Judd.

1051
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,989
That threw up a red flag.

1052
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,157
So at some point they're going

1053
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,367
to turn on each other.

1054
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,494
The quicker I can make that

1055
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,454
happen, the better.

1056
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,498
Because if I want to get further

1057
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,916
in this game, I'm going to have

1058
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,333
to shake things up.

1059
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:50,087
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

1060
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,925
>> That's like a Jersey storm.

1061
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,468
>> At this point of the game, I

1062
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,511
don't trust anybody.

1063
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,386
You never know who's going to

1064
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,221
turn on who, and everybody's

1065
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,057
kind of scouring all over the

1066
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,058
place.

1067
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:02,809
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

1068
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,144
>> Whoa-- seriously.

1069
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,980
>> Lydia is lost.

1070
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:08,606
I mean, she's just totally lost.

1071
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,274
She can't be trusted, so she's

1072
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:10,525
got to go.

1073
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,401
And Gary has been running around

1074
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,320
here like a damn lunatic, trying

1075
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,240
to get anybody on his damn side.

1076
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,407
And I don't know if it worked or

1077
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,034
not.

1078
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:20,618
You just never know until you

1079
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,705
get to Tribal.

1080
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,394
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1081
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,980
the members of the jury.

1082
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,066
Bobby Jon and Jamie voted out at

1083
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:56,696
the last Tribal Council.

1084
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,905
Lydia, at the reward challenge,

1085
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,782
a lot of hostility between you

1086
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,908
and Steph about how much food

1087
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,953
was eaten, who's had the most.

1088
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:04,662
You based your cracking of the

1089
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,999
pots on that fact entirely.

1090
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,585
>> I had a feeling that perhaps

1091
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,794
Stephenie might win this one

1092
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,379
again, so I said, "Heck with

1093
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:13,588
that."

1094
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,297
Nothing personal, but this time

1095
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,423
I want to eat.

1096
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,383
>> PROBST: Nothing personal?

1097
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,718
It's very personal!

1098
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,136
>> Well, Stephenie is also very

1099
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,345
liked in this tribe, and

1100
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,098
whenever anybody wins food

1101
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:25,725
reward challenge, they invite

1102
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,475
her.

1103
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,144
But when we came back to camp,

1104
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,896
Stephenie made it very clear to

1105
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,523
me, "Hey, you know, enough of

1106
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,149
this, enough of this stuff about

1107
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:33,608
me eating, you know.

1108
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,319
I want it to stop right there."

1109
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,737
And I looked at her and I said,

1110
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,529
"You know, hey, this is a game

1111
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,405
Steph.

1112
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,323
"You know, nothing personal, but

1113
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,949
I just wanted a chance to eat."

1114
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,367
>> PROBST: Who is running the

1115
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,327
camp right now?

1116
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:44,952
>> Well, everybody looks up to

1117
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,163
Stephenie.

1118
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,332
She's played the game before, so

1119
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,751
in my eyes, it seems as if Steph

1120
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,003
is running the show.

1121
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,379
>> PROBST: Steph, that is really

1122
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,964
just driving you bonkers

1123
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,424
listening to that.

1124
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,800
>> I'm definitely not running

1125
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,718
the show.

1126
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,594
Did I say I wanted it to stop

1127
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,428
when I we came back?

1128
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,387
You're damn right.

1129
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,597
I said, "Listen, if you got

1130
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,598
something to say, say it to my

1131
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,223
face.

1132
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:06,849
"If not, I don't want to hear it

1133
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,017
anymore."

1134
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,143
That's all I said.

1135
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:12,146
So if that's running the show...

1136
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,773
>> PROBST: Gary, what's your

1137
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,523
take on this?

1138
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,358
>> I personally like Steph, but

1139
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,985
there's some people here that

1140
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,612
are star-struck by her.

1141
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,988
That's not her fault, but they

1142
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,406
all can probably get her

1143
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,075
autograph after the show.

1144
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,410
(<i> laughter</i> )

1145
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,453
>> PROBST: Cindy, are you happy

1146
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,039
with how you've played the game?

1147
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:30,998
Ethically.

1148
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,875
No compromises. I'm good.

1149
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,043
>> Yep, mm-hmm.

1150
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,169
>> PROBST: Judd, happy with how

1151
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:35,503
you played?

1152
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,381
>> Absolutely. Definitely.

1153
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,174
>> PROBST: But in terms of

1154
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:40,800
ethics-- whether or not to lie--

1155
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,010
did you come into this with any

1156
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,971
sort of moral compass, or is it,

1157
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,222
"Hey, it's<i> Survivor,</i> are you

1158
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,056
nuts?"

1159
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,057
>> To be honest with you, I

1160
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,100
don't think I've lied yet, but I

1161
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,017
think I'm going to start lying,

1162
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,102
though.

1163
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:51,978
Everybody here is lying about

1164
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,062
everything.

1165
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,397
I mean, for the last past couple

1166
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,190
of days, there's been lies, man,

1167
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:56,857
over here, over there, up there,

1168
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,483
over here.

1169
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,652
That's basically what's going

1170
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,820
on, man.

1171
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,821
I mean, everybody is sitting

1172
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,780
here like things are fine and

1173
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,864
dandy, but that ain't the case,

1174
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,865
man, seriously.

1175
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,117
So if I want to stick around in

1176
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,576
this game, I'd better start

1177
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:07,785
lying.

1178
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,411
And you know what?

1179
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,495
I'm a damn bad liar, so I might

1180
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,538
be in trouble, man.

1181
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,456
>> PROBST: You said there were

1182
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,499
lies all over the place.

1183
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,500
What are you referring to?

1184
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,085
>> When we went on that reward,

1185
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,713
it was me, Danni, Gary, and

1186
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,089
Steph.

1187
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,674
Gary came flat out and said,

1188
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,300
"Cindy and Lydia should not even

1189
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,011
be here.

1190
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,262
"They were riding coattail the

1191
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,263
whole damn way, and they have

1192
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,264
no damn reason to even be in

1193
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:28,556
this game."

1194
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,432
That came right out of his

1195
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,349
mouth.

1196
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,434
>> That's right, and so what did

1197
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,102
I lie about?

1198
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,311
>> Because then you're trying to

1199
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,521
make an alliance with Lydia.

1200
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,647
>> But I didn't say...

1201
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,857
>> You wanted her out of the

1202
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,066
game.

1203
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,109
>> But did I tell them that they

1204
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,027
should be out of the game?

1205
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,944
I didn't tell them that.

1206
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:42,903
>> You told me that.

1207
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,821
>> I know, but that's not a lie.

1208
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,655
>> Oh, that's a lie.

1209
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,656
>> That's playing the game.

1210
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,073
How is that a lie?

1211
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,283
>> I know, that's playing the

1212
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,284
game.

1213
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,285
>> But that's not a lie.

1214
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,327
I didn't lie to them.

1215
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,162
This is a lie.

1216
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,288
"Hey, you guys the idol is on

1217
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,330
the ground."

1218
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,248
That's a lie.

1219
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,332
>> Okay.

1220
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,333
>> PROBST: Gary, what's the

1221
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:56,959
comment you're talking about the

1222
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,419
idol is on the ground?

1223
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,463
>> Way back when he got the clue

1224
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,256
about the idol, he goes, "Okay,

1225
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,966
I'll tell you, it's on the

1226
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,717
ground."

1227
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,718
Well, I followed him out in the

1228
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,635
woods the next day, and he is

1229
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,137
looking at all the trees.

1230
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,263
So I said, "Hmm, that's strange.

1231
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:10,431
He told me it was on the

1232
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,348
ground."

1233
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:11,932
So I made myself seen in the

1234
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,516
woods, and all of a sudden, he

1235
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,310
starts throwing rocks around,

1236
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,520
and the idol was in the tree.

1237
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,104
>> PROBST: Okay, Judd, you got

1238
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,522
caught.

1239
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,982
You got outed tonight for lying.

1240
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,275
>> Okay, all right, I lied about

1241
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,526
the damn idol.

1242
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,278
Okay.

1243
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:28,157
I told you I'm a bad liar.

1244
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,158
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1245
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,159
vote.

1246
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,160
Rafe, you have the immunity

1247
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:31,702
necklace.

1248
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,661
I can't imagine you are giving

1249
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,454
it up.

1250
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:33,913
>> I want to keep it.

1251
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:34,538
>> PROBST: Rafe is the only one

1252
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,749
you cannot vote for.

1253
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,209
Everybody else is fair game.

1254
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:38,626
It's time to vote.

1255
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,755
Lydia, you're up.

1256
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,513
>> Gary, you've been running

1257
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,348
around the jungle for two days,

1258
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,516
man, like a squirrel trying to

1259
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,309
get a damn nut, man.

1260
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,185
Do me a favor and get the hell

1261
00:39:56,268 --> 00:40:00,272
out of here.

1262
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,204
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1263
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,832
votes.

1264
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,341
Once the votes are read, the

1265
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:28,968
decision is final.

1266
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,177
Person voted out will be asked

1267
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,345
to leave the Tribal Council area

1268
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,346
immediately.

1269
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:35,224
I'll read the votes.

1270
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:40,187
First vote, Gary.

1271
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,522
Cindy.

1272
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,442
One vote Gary, one vote Cindy.

1273
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,194
Gary.

1274
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,739
Two votes Gary, one vote Cindy.

1275
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,283
Gary.

1276
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:56,871
That's three votes Gary.

1277
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,705
12th person voted out

1278
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,416
of<i> Survivor: Guatemala,</i> Gary.

1279
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,292
That's four, it's enough.

1280
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:05,296
You need to bring me your torch.

1281
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,431
Gary, the tribe has spoken.

1282
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:19,435
Time for you to go.

1283
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:25,774
Well, one thing is becoming

1284
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,568
clear to me from these Tribal

1285
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,986
Councils, and that is nobody is

1286
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,654
going down without a fight.

1287
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,239
Which means over the next nine

1288
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,699
days, there should be some big

1289
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,784
battles.

1290
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,286
Grab your torches, head back to

1291
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,245
camp.

1292
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,663
Good night.

1293
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,426
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1294
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,345
from our next episode.

1295
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,306
>> PROBST: Next time on

1296
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,557
<i>Survivor,</i> Danni feels the

1297
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,558
pressure.

1298
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,393
>> This perfect little alliance

1299
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:01,936
is going to have to start

1300
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,145
breaking up.

1301
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,396
I'm definitely not going to go

1302
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,648
down without a fight.

1303
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,815
>> PROBST: Lydia makes a move.

1304
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,733
>> How far do you want to get to

1305
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,067
the final two?

1306
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,443
>> Just as far as you do.

1307
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,194
>> We have seven freakin' days

1308
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,070
left.

1309
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:11,904
Maybe it's time we make a

1310
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:12,863
difference.

1311
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,739
>> PROBST: And the tribe is

1312
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:13,948
shocked.

1313
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,951
>> This is so random!

1314
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:22,706
>> What a great time. I had fun.

1315
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,708
