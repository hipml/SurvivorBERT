telling me that I would've been

13
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,935
eliminated before Bubba was.

14
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,061

it.

129
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,938
He's gotten away with it to this

130
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,147
point, but now we're starting to

131
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:33,481
make comments.

132

three or four bowls, you know.

139
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:39,696
I'd make sure everybody else is

140
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,239
getting the same amount, but I'd

141
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,115
eat more.

142
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:42,824

00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,559
the morning, usually the first

157
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,978
thing that I do is I bow down

158
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,438
and I pray, and today in

159
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,190
particular, I got a lot of

160
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,358
things to be thankful for,

161
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,570
because for some twist in fate,

162
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,571
I cracked these ladies, and they

163
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,989
carried me through one more

164
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,532
night.

165
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:24,991
So this morning, I was

166
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,993
particularly thankful, and I

167
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:27,702
might not be able to bounce

168
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,912
around laughing and smiling, but

169
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,290
I'm just so thankful.

170
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,916
Then it's down to business.

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,877
So my new objective is to work

172
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,130
on Leann and Ami and wrap myself

173
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:39,756
into their relationship, 'cause

174
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,507
I'm still an alliance of one

175
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,760
right now.

176
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,430
Well, Ami, here's my situation.

177
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,473
I need to know where you guys

178
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,100
stand with regard to me, because

179
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,145
there's no way in hell I want to

180
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,521
be eliminated before Eliza.

181
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,690
I had explained to you that I

182
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,609
would back you all the way

183
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,693
through jury and everything

184
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,737
else.

185
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,114
>> The biggest thing... the

186
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:05,865
biggest thing for all the women

187
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,533
was no women's alliance has

188
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,576
stayed together through this

189
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,578
game ever, not once, ever.

190
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,288
That's kind of what's keeping us

191
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,790
going is that we want women...

192
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,582
>> Then what I'm going to

193
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:14,916
tell you this.

194
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,627
You know, if-if I get smoked,

195
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,212
how far are you guys going to

196
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,630
go, you know?

197
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,631
And for me, just on a personal

198
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,717
level, I mean, give me a break.

199
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,426
Eliza over me?

200
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,720
How much can she bring to this

201
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,888
team, and how much have I

202
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,807
already brought to the table?

203
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,557
>> Unfortunately for you,

204
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,559
the fact that the women had this

205
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,519
alliance excludes you right off

206
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,105
the bat.

207
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:37,522
>> Well, you know...

208
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,564
>> What happens when the

209
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,442
merger comes with the men?

210
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,652
>> (<i> sighs</i> )

211
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,444
>> How do you keep your

212
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,613
face and-and say, "You know

213
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,197
what?

214
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,906
I'm sticking with the women?"

215
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,907
And what about the guys back

216
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,574
home?

217
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,158
>> You... What do you mean?

218
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:49,909
What do you...

219
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,284
what do you...?

220
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:50,618
What-what...?

221
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,619
What do you mean, what about

222
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,453
the guys back home?

223
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,164
>> Don't cuss at me.

224
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,124
>> What do you mean?

225
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:56,874
>> Well, don't cuss at me.

226
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,875
>> Then don't treat me like I'm

227
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,335
some sort of lackey.

228
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,087
What you want is your playing

229
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,421
me, and you want me to continue

230
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,256
doing all the work, and 110%...

231
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,173
>> I don't want you to do

232
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:04,507
anything.

233
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,299
>> Rory...

234
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,092
>> Sit and your butt and

235
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:06,968
have a good time with it, Rory.

236
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,677
>> Rory, we're not

237
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,302
playing it off...

238
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,137
>> I've already told you,

239
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,679
just like I told you on the

240
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,681
trail yesterday, that I would

241
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,933
support you 120%.

242
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,017
I don't give a ...

243
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:15,893
about Sarge.

244
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,644
I don't give a ... about Chad.

245
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,479
I don't know them men.

246
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,231
Who has been pumping this whole

247
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:20,982
time?

248
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,066
>> Me, you.

249
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,775
>> Right.

250
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,192
>> Yeah.

251
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:23,734
Leann.

252
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,026
>> Right.

253
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,069
>> Yeah.

254
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:25,945
>> And you can't say that

255
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,531
about everybody on Yasur.

256
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,825
The ladies of Yasur have

257
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,326
basically told me that I'm going

258
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,580
to be the next one voted out.

259
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,373
That's done a job on my head, so

260
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,625
I've decided that I will go into

261
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,669
self-destruct mode, and one of

262
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:45,339
the things that I discussed with

263
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,425
my wife before I came out here

264
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,468
was I am going to institute a

265
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,345
slash, burn and salt the earth

266
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,388
policy.

267
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,639
What that means is if I get

268
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,600
voted off this island, the Yasur

269
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,769
tribe will burn.

270
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:12,575
I can guarantee that.

271
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,368
>> PROBST: What's going on,

272
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,369
guys?OBST: What's going on,

273
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,580
>> Hey, Jeff.

274
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,581
>> PROBST: Getting your first

275
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,582
look at the new Yasur tribe.

276
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,124
>> Lisa.

277
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:20,917
Lisa is gone.

278
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,626
>> Oh, yeah.

279
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,586
>> PROBST: Lisa voted out at the

280
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,587
last Tribal Council.

281
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,339
>> Not what we said.

282
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,089
Not what we said.

283
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:27,965
>> PROBST: Lopevi, a lot of

284
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,383
surprised looks on your faces as

285
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,219
you saw that it was Lisa voted

286
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:31,385
out.

287
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,678
>> Yeah, big time.

288
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,596
>> Yeah, I thought for

289
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,555
sure that they would get rid of

290
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,184
him, keep the women together.

291
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,519
>> Wow, what can I say?

292
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,854
>> PROBST: Okay.

293
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,939
Let's get to today's challenge.

294
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,440
It is for reward, and it will

295
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,733
require a steady hand.

296
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,236
On my go, one tribe member at a

297
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:48,861
time is going to begin breaking

298
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,738
coconuts.

299
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,198
Once you've filled your coconut

300
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:52,907
shell, you'll make your way

301
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,741
through the obstacle course.

302
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,244
For the first stage, you got to

303
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,245
make your way through a wood

304
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:57,912
crawl.

305
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,746
Second stage, you'll go up and

306
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,248
over a see-saw.

307
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,040
The third stage, you will high

308
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,167
step through a series of wooden

309
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,001
hurdles.

310
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,461
Fourth stage: another see-saw,

311
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,129
and the final stage, you'll

312
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,006
crawl through the bamboo cage.

313
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,675
When you reach the end, you'll

314
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,093
pour the juice remaining in your

315
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:12,718
coconut shell into a hand-blown

316
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,012
glass jar.

317
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,973
The jars are not identical, but

318
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,391
the black lines designate an

319
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,809
equal amount.

320
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,685
If you spill all of your juice

321
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,353
while you're on the obstacle

322
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,604
course, you come back and you go

323
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,522
to the back of the line.

324
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,148
First tribe to get back to the

325
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:26,774
start with their glass container

326
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,360
filled with coconut juice wins

327
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,361
reward.

328
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,362
Want to know what you're playing

329
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:31,529
for?

330
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,321
>> ALL: Yes.

331
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,281
>> PROBST: You're playing for a

332
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,282
visit to a home café.

333
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:34,907
We have a coffee maker, lots of

334
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,868
Folgers coffee-- every flavor

335
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,869
you could think of-- something

336
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,954
for everybody.

337
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,539
We also have croissants.

338
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,164
>> Oh, yeah.

339
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,165
>> PROBST: We also have juices.

340
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,586
And because it is a home café,

341
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,753
also a little reminder of the

342
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,255
love that is waiting for you

343
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:49,797
back home.

344
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,507
>> Oh, come on.

345
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,258
>> PROBST: And there's one more

346
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:52,466
thing.

347
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,801
The winning tribe will take a

348
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,178
coffee-maker, mugs and coffee

349
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,179
back to their camp with them.

350
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:57,388
>> Yeah!

351
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,014
>> Oh...

352
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,848
my God.

353
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,683
>> Oh, man.

354
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,601
>> PROBST: Okay, Lopevi, you

355
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,602
have one extra member.

356
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,395
You're sitting somebody out.

357
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,146
Who's it going to be?

358
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,230
>> Sarge.

359
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,148
>> PROBST: Sarge, you'll take a

360
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,648
spot on the bench.

361
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,941
Everybody else, wait for my go.

362
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:14,947
>> PROBST: Here we go.

363
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,198
For reward-- a visit to the Home

364
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,199
Café.

365
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,701
Survivors ready.

366
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,412
Go!

367
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,747
John has his cracked, so does

368
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,332
Eliza filling up her coconut

369
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,374
shell.

370
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,792
John filling up his ball.

371
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,294
Eliza first on the course.

372
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,921
John on the course.

373
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,007
Both in the first obstacle.

374
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,716
Taking care of that juice.

375
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,136
Every drop counts.

376
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:41,974
Eliza on the seesaw, John

377
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,894
falling behind.

378
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,397
>> Nice job, Eliza.

379
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:48,898
>> Good girl, good girl.

380
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,733
>> Come on, John.

00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,981
(<i> laughter</i> )

764
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,900
Yeah, so...

765
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:35,359
I knew they were.

766
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,277
>> They're playing it, ain't

767
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:37,694
they?

768
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:37,945
>> Yeah.

769
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,489
>> Sarge told me that

770
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,075
Chris and I and Sarge and Chad

771
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,618
would be the final four.

772
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,410
They turned around and they told

773
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,663
Julie the same exact thing.

774
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,413
>> I just think the guys

775
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,832
are going to shaft us whenever

776
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,416
they get a chance, no matter

777
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,335
what they sit there and say to

778
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,044
us.

779
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,253
>> I figured they was

780
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:55,754
playing us.

781
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,798
>> Yeah, of course they] are.

782
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,508
I approached Twila and I kind of

783
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,051
threw out a little reverse

784
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,719
psychology, and she indeed said

785
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,304
they had, you know, promised her

786
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:04,596
final four,

787
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,015
and so I said they did me also,

788
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,474
but they hadn't, so it

789
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,810
completely turned her off to

790
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,895
them, and now I have her on my

791
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,312
side currently.

792
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,355
I mean, I don't have any

793
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,398
loyalties to the women.

794
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,774
>> I don't either.

795
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,525
Between the two of us, we've got

796
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,944
to stay on the guys' side, but

797
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,487
they're worried now because the

798
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,989
number of the women are up.

799
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,490
>> Oh, of course.

800
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,325
All right, so, we are pretty

801
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,410
much pretending we're their

802
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,619
pawns.

803
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,370
>> Yes.

804
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,538
>> But little do they

805
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:29,705
know.

806
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,456
Me and Twila have a rocky

807
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,166
relationship, but now, I guess,

808
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,418
she's the only one that I'm

809
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,003
definitely concrete with that

810
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:36,670
I have a plan.

811
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,462
And I weaseled my way back in

812
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,840
because I knew that she was

813
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,633
getting sucked in with the guys,

814
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,384
so my plan worked, for right

815
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,887
now.

816
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,098
I guess this is our pact then to

817
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:48,515
each other.

818
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,434
>> You're gonna have to

819
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,476
have somebody to depend on.

820
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,227
>> Right.

821
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,894
>> That you can honestly depend

822
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,729
on.

823
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,023
>> And it's so unlikely to be

824
00:21:56,106 --> 00:22:09,536
us.

825
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,122
>> Tree mail.

826
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,374
>> We got mail.

827
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,792
We've got mail.

828
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,878
>> Toys to play with.

829
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,047
"Practice, practice, practice.

830
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,715
Each of you has to shoot, for

831
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,592
one who performs poorly tonight

832
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,801
will get the boot."

833
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,719
Look.

834
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,305
We just got some tree mail, and

835
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,140
it's a sack of marbles and a

836
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:30,432
slingshot.

837
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,476
We're a little scared.

838
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,852
If we lose, there's always a

839
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,978
possibility to go home.

840
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:35,604
That's the downfall, and it's

841
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,773
definitely an option I could be

842
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,648
going home tonight.

843
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,691
>> Whatever way you hold

844
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,734
it, that's the way we held it

845
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,151
as kids.

846
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,194
>> I never had one.

847
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:42,611
>> Oh.

848
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,321
If you're right-handed, you want

849
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,405
to pull with the hand that you

850
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,490
normally are, 'cause you're

851
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,616
aiming like this.

852
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,242
Looks like we're going back to

853
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,702
the boys' town, back to the days

854
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,120
of knocking out windows and

855
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:52,287
stuff.

856
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,622
I mean, there's no question who

857
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,873
is going to win the challenge

858
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,791
today, I mean, Lopevi.

859
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,501
Yasur is like a high school team

860
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,460
against, you know, an SEC team.

861
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,462
Uh, there's no comparison.

862
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,172
They're gonna give us a run for

863
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,633
our money, but they won't win.

864
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,550
>> Oh, okay.

865
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,010
>> Not too shabby.

866
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,637
>> I've been a threat

867
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:08,970
since day one.

868
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,306
Everyone's already told me that,

869
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,724
so right now it's strictly a

870
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,059
game-based game for me.

871
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,060
The strategy can wait until

872
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:15,560
later.

873
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,145
Right now it's strictly I need

874
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,605
to win the immunities, because I

875
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,732
do not want to go to Tribal

876
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,235
Council.

877
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,402
>> Let's get ready to

878
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,656
rumble!

879
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,575
Introducing, the ladies of

880
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,452
Yasur, plus one.

881
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,872
I feel so fabulous today, I can

882
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,582
only speak for myself, but I am

883
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,751
at high rev already this

884
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,128
morning.

885
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,838
Perhaps it's the three cups of

886
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,256
coffee that I've had this

887
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,382
morning already.

888
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,341
(<i> laughs</i> )

889
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,759
I'm ready to run over there,

890
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,426
quite frankly.

891
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,928
This is just for direction and

892
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,764
aim.

893
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,932
>> Hey.

894
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:54,808
>> That was a good shot.

895
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,559
This challenge is of the utmost

896
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,602
importance for me because if we

897
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,563
lose immunity challenge today,

898
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,564
then I will be going home

899
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:07,863
tonight.

900
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:15,370
>> PROBST: Come on in.

901
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,288
All right.

902
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,289
Shall we get to today's

903
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:17,706
challenge?

904
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,498
>> Let's do it.

905
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,001
>> PROBST: First things first.

906
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:26,381
Give it up, Chris.

907
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,341
Immunity back up for grabs.

908
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,010
This morning in tree mail, you

909
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,303
received a slingshot.

910
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,013
I hope you practiced with it.

911
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,055
Here's how the challenge is

912
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,389
gonna work.

913
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,515
One tribe member at a time,

914
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,517
you're going to attempt to break

915
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,518
your tribe-colored ceramic tiles

916
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,561
hanging on the grid.

917
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,521
A tile's considered broken when

918
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,315
no piece is connected to more

919
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:43,690
than two wires.

920
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,109
Each of you will randomly be

921
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,611
assigned a lane on the matching

922
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,528
game board.

923
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,072
Each time you break a tile,

924
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,282
you'll flip over the

925
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,242
corresponding wooden tile on the

926
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,785
game board, so once you've

927
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,704
knocked out any given column of

928
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,997
ceramic tiles you will have

929
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,498
flipped over the corresponding

930
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,875
wooden tiles on the game board,

931
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,210
and the tribe member in that

932
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:03,793
column will move off the board

933
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,420
to the finish mat.

934
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,671
Once you're on the mat, you're

935
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,672
no longer a shooter.

936
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,424
Your goal: knock out all 20

937
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,383
tiles.

938
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,760
Lopevi, one extra member;

939
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,136
sitting somebody out.

940
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,387
Sarge sat out yesterday.

941
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,347
Who's it gonna be today?

942
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,348
>> I'm sitting out.

943
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,515
>> PROBST: Chris will sit out.

944
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,642
Chris, take a spot on the bench.

945
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,060
Everybody else take a spot

946
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,103
behind the game board, wait for

947
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:22,729
my go.

948
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,151
All right, first shooters up.

949
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,363
Rory and Chad.

950
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,697
Lopevi will start things.

951
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,786
Chad connects.

952
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,579

00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,674
Otherwise he'd be going home,

1141
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,550
you know?

1142
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,050
He's earned that right.

1143
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,845
So I'm really glad that we won,

1144
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,513
but at the same time I looked

1145
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,223
over at Lopevi, right, as soon

1146
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:32,932
as we won, and I looked at

1147
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,100
Julie, and it hurt.

1148
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,101
It hurt to know that either

1149
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,936
Julie or Twila are going home

1150
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,229
tonight.

1151
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,339
>> We lost the challenge

1152
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,965
today, and we're going to Tribal

1153
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,883
Council.

1154
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,177
Today was the foundation, the

1155
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,179
basis of the rest of the game

1156
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,806
for us, but losing today meant

1157
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,933
it's equal to them, 5-5.

1158
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:16,893
The strategy of the game has

1159
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,186
changed now.

1160
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,771
It could go anywhere.

1161
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,480
>> I'm not confident

1162
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,606
Julie's staying with us, dude.

1163
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,190
If we merge, she's going right

1164
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,525
with the women.

1165
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,109
>> Julie said to me

1166
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,278
earlier this afternoon, she'd

1167
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,029
like to get rid of John.

1168
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,531
>> Well, yeah, there you go.

1169
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,575
See, she's thinking it's her

1170
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,451
turn, man.

1171
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,161
If we merge, John's gone, she's

1172
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,037
with the women, we're gone.

1173
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,874
Trust in this game is huge, and

1174
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,542
at this stage, it's even bigger,

1175
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,878
because there's more at stake.

1176
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,129
John, I don't trust, and Julie--

1177
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,757
I don't believe that she would

1178
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,133
definitely stay with Lopevi if

1179
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,510
we merge.

1180
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,886
As much as I don't want to keep

1181
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,429
John around, if we keep John and

1182
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,180
Julie goes next, we've got the

1183
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,765
guys.

1184
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,684
>> John has been a target

1185
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,644
to send home ever since the game

1186
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,144
started.

1187
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,771
I mean, he was on the other side

1188
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,481
with the guys, but Chad's

1189
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,233
concerned that maybe keeping

1190
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,610
John around a little bit longer

1191
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,861
might be the best thing.

1192
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:09,612
He doesn't have a whole lot of

1193
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,863
trust in Julie.

1194
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,781
>> It's up in the air,

1195
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,991
man, with John.

1196
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:14,826
I don't know.

1197
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,868
If-if I'm convinced that Julie's

1198
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,078
with us, then we can get rid of

1199
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,454
John, but, I mean, otherwise,

1200
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,872
it's a male-female thing.

1201
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,124
The women's going to be a huge

1202
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,126
enticement for her to go over.

1203
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:23,960
Man, she's...

1204
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:24,544
I can tell she's...

1205
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,545
>> I don't think they're

1206
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,629
so much women, or they wouldn't

1207
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,839
have voted off Lisa.

1208
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,674
I don't think they're hung up on

1209
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,134
just the women.

1210
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,051
>> (<i> sighs</i> )

1211
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,220
It's going to be tough.

1212
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,179
It's not solid anymore right

1213
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:54,198
now.

1214
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,159
>> What does Chad say,

1215
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:56,451
anything?

1216
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,994
>> Sometimes I don't know

1217
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,203
where Chad's coming from.

1218
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,372
Every time, it doesn't matter

1219
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,457
how much you talk to him, you

1220
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,207
still go to Tribal Council with

1221
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,709
doubt.

1222
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,668
>> In my tribe, I don't

1223
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,169
trust anyone.

1224
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,295
I can't trust anyone, but I have

1225
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,381
to at least put my faith in one

1226
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,132
person, and I do with Chris,

1227
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,301
because I think me and Chris can

1228
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,218
really do some damage when it

1229
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,219
comes down to the...

1230
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:15,887
to the

1231
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,181
dwindling of-of both tribes.

1232
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,182
>> Just off the top of

1233
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:19,766
your head, if we was leaving

1234
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,391
right now, who would you want to

1235
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,393
vote for?

1236
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,519
>> See, the thing is,

1237
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,645
I'd say Julie, but I really

1238
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,563
don't think she'd vote on the

1239
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,230
girls' side, so I think she's an

1240
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,566
asset to have later on.

1241
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,276
And I think with-with Chad, he

1242
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,861
gets the sympathy vote.

1243
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,862
Sounds bad, but it's true, you

1244
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,696
know?

1245
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,323
>> I'm coming to grips with...

1246
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,199
You know, I understand what

1247
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,325
you're saying.

1248
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:37,825
>> If it ever came down

1249
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,202
to him and one of us in the

1250
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,536
finals, final two, he'd get it

1251
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:40,787
in a...

1252
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,329
in a heartbeat, because,

1253
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,288
you know...

1254
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,331
I thought of Chad since day one,

1255
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,209
because he's type of guy that

1256
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,711
just gets by every time; not

1257
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,588
just gets by on the vote, but

1258
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,422
just gets by without anyone

1259
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,507
noticing him.

1260
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,509
And Chad can seriously get some

1261
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,218
sympathy points, which he's

1262
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,719
great at, because he does have

1263
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,096
one leg, and he's doing amazing,

1264
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,389
but we can't handle any sympathy

1265
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,099
points against us, so he's got

1266
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,351
to go now.

1267
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,228
What's up with you guys?

1268
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,814
>> Stacking some wood, boy.

1269
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,606
>> Oh, yeah?

1270
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,941
>> What are you doing?

1271
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:10,650
>> Wondering which one of

1272
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,943
us is going home tonight.

1273
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:12,735
>> That's what I came

1274
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,195
to tell you.

1275
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:14,403
Chad.

1276
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,279
>> So, you want Chad tonight?

1277
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,280
>> Yeah, Chad tonight.

1278
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,949
>> It's not going to be

1279
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:18,199
me or her?

1280
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:18,658
>> It's not going...

1281
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,076
I swear on my life that it's not

1282
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:20,326
you two.

1283
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,118
>> Go ahead, hon.

1284
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,036
I'll be there later.

1285
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:22,662
>> But me-me and Chris

1286
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,454
are being seriously true on

1287
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,457
this, and we just think we-we

1288
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,208
could all be tighter with this

1289
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,209
group.

1290
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:28,793
>> Julie, are you comfortable

1291
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,504
with that-- voting off Chad?

1292
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,381
>> Depends on, uh, Sarge,

1293
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:33,798
right, if he's down?

1294
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,465
>> Yeah.

1295
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,299
>> Well, even if Sarge

1296
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:35,758
isn't, that means it's

1297
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,217
everyone against...

1298
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,969
>> Oh, three against...

1299
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:38,386
>> It would be...

1300
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:38,886
it'd be

1301
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,846
us four against Chad.

1302
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,847
>> Yeah, us four.

1303
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,764
I take Twila's word, 'cause she

1304
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,182
is a rough redneck, and to me,

1305
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,308
all rough rednecks that I have

1306
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,728
met are pretty loyal.

1307
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,192
At this point, everyone could be

1308
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,610
completely playing everyone, so

1309
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,070
people are either going with

1310
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:56,946
what I said, or people are going

1311
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,073
to vote me off, so I-I can't

1312
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,408
stress enough that tonight is

1313
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,368
the night-- for me, anyways-- to

1314
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,369
figure out where I stand in this

1315
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,453
game.

1316
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,309
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal

1317
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:26,976
Council.

1318
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:27,602
Haven't seen you guys in a

1319
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,019
while.

1320
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:28,895
>> Yup.

1321
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,062
>> PROBST: So, Chris, everything

1322
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,105
seemed to be going so well for

1323
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,273
Lopevi, and then out of nowhere,

1324
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,650
back-to-back losses.

1325
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,985
What happened?

1326
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:36,944
>> I don't know.

1327
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,612
You know, it seemed like when,

1328
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,280
you know, we-we-we-we went on

1329
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,781
four wins in a row.

1330
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,574
It seemed like we were

1331
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,366
dominating.

1332
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:42,992
It didn't even seem like it was

1333
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,952
close, but today, it was close.

1334
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,329
I mean, you know, they-they beat

1335
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,330
us by a couple, uh, but that's

1336
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,081
all it takes, and that's why

1337
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:49,624
we're here and they're not.

1338
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,374
>> PROBST: So, Chad, what was

1339
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,752
the reaction when you got back

1340
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:52,960
to camp?

1341
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,086
You guys haven't had to

1342
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:54,712
contemplate voting somebody out

1343
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,421
in a long time.

1344
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,923
>> Right.

1345
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:57,256
When we are

1346
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,550
going off to do our little wood

1347
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,510
gathering and pot scrubbing,

1348
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,095
you're aware of who's going with

1349
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,555
who, and if you're alone, or

1350
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,265
maybe you shouldn't be alone,

1351
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,391
and, you know, so there's a lot

1352
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,644
of posturing going on, you know.

1353
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,561
We're scrambling here before,

1354
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,395
uh, Tribal Council.

1355
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,438
>> PROBST: Chris, does everybody

1356
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,024
have a role in this tribe?

1357
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,025
>> I think to a certain

1358
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,068
degree, yeah, everybody's got a

1359
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:17,276
role.

1360
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,487
Um, everybody does something

1361
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,322
that benefits the tribe during

1362
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,657
the day.

1363
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,033
There's always a time when we're

1364
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:24,992
going to need to eat, and, uh,

1365
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:25,576
we're going to need firewood,

1366
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,452
and there's always someone

1367
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,246
willing to step up and do that.

1368
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:29,830
I think it's a team effort.

1369
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,124
>> PROBST: Sarge, what does

1370
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,084
Twila do well?

1371
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,878
>> Um, Twila is the, uh,

1372
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,463
wonder for, um, exotic foods.

1373
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:41,384
She is the preparer of meals,

1374
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,094
and she's constantly going to

1375
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,220
get firewood.

1376
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:44,637
She-she just...

1377
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:44,845
she does

1378
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,930
everything.

1379
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:46,973
>> PROBST: John, what could

1380
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,265
Twila do better?

1381
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,600
>> Um, the thing with Twila is,

1382
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,435
she really is the workhorse.

1383
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,229
Her and Sarge are the two

1384
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,313
workhorses.

1385
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,231
Um, as far as do better, I would

1386
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,025
love to see her take naps.

1387
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:58,275
I would...

1388
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,193
I would love it.

1389
00:37:59,277 --> 00:37:59,902
I would not feel distressed

1390
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,404
around camp if I saw Twila say,

1391
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,114
"Hey, let's kick back and take a

1392
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,490
nap," 'cause I'm the number one

1393
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,825
napper go-going.

1394
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,118
I mean, I like taking naps, and-

1395
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:07,743
and I never see her take little

1396
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,578
catnaps ever.

1397
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,663
>> PROBST: So, if you look over,

1398
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,414
and you see the workhorse never

1399
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,415
taking a nap, how do you ever

1400
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,750
justify taking a nap?

1401
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,584
>> I thank you very much.

1402
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,003
>> Because... because

1403
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:17,920
whenever-whenever something...

1404
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,171
I'm asked to do anything, I-I

1405
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:19,463
will do it.

1406
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,173
We all do our roles.

1407
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:21,716
I mean, I-I might take more

1408
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,926
naps, but she could take naps,

1409
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,093
too.

1410
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:24,719
It's-it's okay to take a nap.

1411
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,469
That's the thing.

1412
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,221
We don't always need to be

1413
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,055
working.

1414
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,348
>> PROBST: So, Chad, tell me

1415
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,349
about life at camp, because

1416
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,185
you're living with these people,

1417
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,437
but you are competing against

1418
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:34,645
them.

1419
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,605
How do you know if you're

1420
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,024
getting to know somebody well or

1421
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:38,482
being played?

1422
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,443
>> I think that there's a...

1423
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,027
there's a very good general

1424
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,154
first impression and a good way

1425
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,822
of someone perceiving someone

1426
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,365
else that gets down to the core

1427
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,242
level who that person is, and if

1428
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,744
you feel like you're perceptive

1429
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,162
enough that you can get to that

1430
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,329
core level quickly, then I think

1431
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,581
can you trust them, unless

1432
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,540
they're of someone who's

1433
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,709
completely manipulative and

1434
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,710
someone that can...

1435
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,377
>> PROBST: Imagine that in this

1436
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:58,794
game.

1437
00:38:58,878 --> 00:38:59,253
>> ...that can lie and

1438
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:01,255
cheat very well, but I feel like

1439
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:01,714
I can pick up on that.

1440
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,381
I really do.

1441
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,842
>> PROBST: Julie, think this

1442
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,926
tribe trusts you?

1443
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,094
>> Well, the time spent

1444
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,554
together has been very telling,

1445
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,805
and, um, I think we've gelled

1446
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,848
really well, especially with

1447
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,391
winning, and it is just a matter

1448
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,435
of meshing well and the energies

1449
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,436
put together.

1450
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,812
And, um, there has been doubt

1451
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,147
and there probably still is, but

1452
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,565
hopefully, you know, even with

1453
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,942
this vote, um, the proof will be

1454
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:22,401
there.

1455
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,444
>> PROBST: Chris, what are you

1456
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,279
basing your vote on?

1457
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,155
>> Um, I'm basing...

1458
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:26,489
I'm basing

1459
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,282
my vote on a couple things.

1460
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:29,617
First of all, I'm basing my-my

1461
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:29,950
vote on trust.

1462
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,827
Trust is hard to come by in this

1463
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,162
game, and sometimes, you think

1464
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,247
you have it, and-and you turn

1465
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:35,831
around, and that wink or that

1466
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,582
nod kind of puts that trust in

1467
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,625
doubt.

1468
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,461
Um, I'm also basing my-my vote

1469
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,545
on my future in the game, who's

1470
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,589
going to benefit me or benefit

1471
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,424
the people that, you know, I'm

1472
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,176
playing the game with or aligned

1473
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,135
with.

1474
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,678
>> PROBST: With that, it is time

1475
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,513
to vote.

1476
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,556
Sarge, you're up.

1477
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,159
>> I'm afraid you might

1478
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,369
sneak by some more, and I need

1479
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,621
you to go.

1480
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,976
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1481
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:37,268
votes.

1482
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,781
Once the votes are read, the

1483
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,782
decision is final.

1484
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,616
The person voted out will be

1485
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,951
asked to leave the Tribal

1486
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,411
Council area immediately.

1487
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,537
I'll read the votes.

1488
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,834
First vote: John.

1489
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,004
Chad.

1490
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,840
One vote John, one vote Chad.

1491
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,635
John.

1492
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,056
Two votes John, one vote Chad.

1493
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,350
John.

1494
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,101
That's three votes John, one

1495
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,645
vote Chad.

1496
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,981
Eighth person voted out of

1497
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,733
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu:</i> John.

1498
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,693
That's four, and that's enough.

1499
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,695
You need to bring me your torch.

1500
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,290
John, the tribe has spoken.

1501
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,876
It's time for you to go.

1502
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,295
>> Take it easy.

1503
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,136
>> PROBST: Well, John said it

1504
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,179
himself.

1505
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,138
