00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,502
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,212
"SURVIVOR"... YOU HAVE TWO

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,755
MINUTES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER YOU

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,215
CAN OFF THIS BOAT.

5
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:11,511
18 NEW CASTAWAYS DIVIDED INTO

6
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,054
THREE TRIBES.

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,306
THE BRAINS TRIBE HAS A TON OF

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:15,598
KNOWLEDGE.

9
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,393
>> I WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT

10
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,227
DOING DATA ANALYSIS.

11
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,228
>> Jeff: NO ONE'S RESUME WAS

12
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,229
LONGER THAN DEBBIE'S.

13
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,149
>> I'M A CAPTAIN, CIVIL AIR

14
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:24,399
PATROL.

15
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,484
I HAVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING.

16
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,820
>> BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

17
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,446
>> Jeff: BUT IT DIDN'T IMPRESS

18
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,780
HER TRIBE.

19
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,115
>> SHE ANNOYS EVERYBODY TO

20
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:32,490
DEATH.

21
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,118
>> Jeff: THE BEAUTY TRIBE, THE

22
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,412
WOMEN THOUGHT THEY COULD USE TY.

23
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,247
>> TY'S PERFECT TO TAKE ALONG

24
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,415
WITH US.

25
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,334
>> BY TAI GOT CAUGHT LOOKING FOR

26
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,795
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, MAKING

27
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,588
HIMSELF THE ODD MAN OUT.

28
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,757
>> I DON'T FIT IN, SO I FEEL

29
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,591
LIKE I'M IN TROUBLE.

30
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,634
>> Anchor: THE BRAWN TRIBE WAS

31
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:59,309
FLECKING THEIR MUSCLE, BUT

32
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,060
ALECIA COULDN'T KEEP UP.

33
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,270
>> SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

34
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,813
>> HARD SUN.

35
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,273
MY SHOULDERS ARE FRIED.

36
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,109
>> IT'S SO HOT OUT HERE, IT

37
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,278
SCRAMBLES YOUR BRAIN.

38
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,613
>> Jeff: BUT AUBRY WASN'T THE

39
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,865
ONLY ONE LOSING HER MIND.

40
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,200
>> I HAVE A BUG IN MY EAR.

41
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,159
>> IT HURTS SO BAD.

42
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,078
>> I SEE IT.

43
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,246
EW!

44
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,334
>> Jeff: AT FIRST IMMUNITY

45
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,128
CHALLENGE, DARNELL AND ALECIA

46
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,590
WERE A MESS, EXPOSING BRAWN'S

47
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,259
WEAKNESS.

48
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,304
THE BRAWN TRIBE GOES TO TRIBAL

49
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,514
COUNCIL.

50
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,059
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, ALECIA FOUGHT

51
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:41,684
TO STAY IN THE GAME.

52
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,395
>> I'LL WORK MY BUTT OFF IN

53
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,940
CHALLENGES, AND I WILL STEP UP.

54
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,107
>> Jeff: HER TRIBE GAVE HER

55
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,567
ANOTHER CHANCE, SENDING DARNELL

56
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,276
HOME.

57
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,070
DARNELL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

58
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,488
THERE WAS A THEME TO TONIGHT'S

59
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:53,696
TRIBAL.

60
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,280
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK THE

61
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,616
TALK, YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO WALK

62
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,200
THE WALK.

63
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,868
17 ARE LEFT.

64
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:11,464
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

65
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,383
>> LET'S NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.

66
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,760
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY, I'M

67
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,137
REALLY GOING TO STEP IT UP.

68
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,515
>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE,

69
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:20,974
SWEETHEART.

70
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,976
>> ALECIA, NOW DO YOU TRUST US?

71
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:23,810
>> YES.

72
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,478
>> NOW WE CAN TRUST YOU?

73
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:25,728
>> YES.

74
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,563
>> ALL RIGHT.

75
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,231
>> I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS THERE

76
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,232
FOR A MINUTE.

77
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,608
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO TRY

78
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,193
AND VOTE ME OUT TONIGHT.

79
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:32,735
FORTUNATELY DARNELL ENDED UP

80
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,320
GOING HOME.

81
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,448
BUT WHAT THREW ME OFF, IS IF YOU

82
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,075
GUYS WANT ME HERE, WHY ARE YOU

83
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,119
TALKING SO MUCH CRAP TO ME IN

84
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:41,369
TROUBLE.

85
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,079
I ALMOST WONDER, I COULD BE

86
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:46,416
WRONG, BUT I SAW JENNY AND JASON

87
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,042
WHISPERING DURING TRIBAL.

88
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,419
AT ONE POINT I THOUGHT I HEARD

89
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,629
SOMEONE SAY, "I CHANGED MY

90
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:51,838
MIND."

91
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,131
MAYBE THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE ME

92
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,465
OUT.

93
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,801
>> I'M JUST REALLY CONFUSED AT

94
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,928
THIS POINT.

95
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,557
>> I AM GOING TO CHOP MY FINGER

96
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:02,724
OFF.

97
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,725
>> I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

98
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,062
>> THE TRUTH IS BLONDE WAS THIS

99
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,439
CLOSE TO GOING HOME TONIGHT, SO

100
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,900
SHE SHOULD BE THANKING HER LUCKY

101
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,610
STARS SHE HAS TO SPEND THREE

102
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,570
MORE DAYS HERE OR HOWEVER LONG,

103
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,237
BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST, SHE'S

104
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,365
DRIVING ME NUTS.

105
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,576
>> TO BE HONEST, WE STARTED TO

106
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,954
RECONSIDER OUR VOTE.

107
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,414
SCOT AND I ARE LIKE, ARE WE

108
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,999
DOING THE RIGHT THING?

109
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,251
>> WE ALMOST GOT IT, GUYS.

110
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,045
WE HAD AN.

111
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,588
BER AND IT WENT OUT, BUT WE

112
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,882
ALMOST GOT IT.

113
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,883
>> EMBRYO?

114
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,051
>> ME AND MY WORDS.

115
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,261
>> SHE'S JUST SO DUMB.

116
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,847
I MEAN, END OF THE DAY, SHE'S

117
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,557
NEXT.

118
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:51,272
>> YEAH.

119
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,584
>> OH, MY GOSH.

120
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:11,918
IT IS.

121
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:12,710
>> WOW.

122
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,379
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY

123
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,381
STANDING IS WITH THE TRIBE.

124
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,299
SO I WANT DESPERATELY TO GO OUT

125
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,301
AND LOOK FOR THAT ADOLL, BUT I

126
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,470
GOT CAUGHT THE FIRST DAY, AND I

127
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:26,557
DON'T WANT TO PUT A TARGET ON MY

128
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,309
BACK.

129
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,770
I SAY I WENT TO GET WATER.

130
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,938
I'M GOING TO GO.

131
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,398
I'LL GO REALLY FAST.

132
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,315
I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHERE I WAS

133
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,693
LOOKING THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE I

134
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,528
THINK THAT'S NOSE OBVIOUS PLACE.

135
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,446
WHAT DID I MISS?

136
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,824
DID I PICK OUT THIS ONE?

137
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,533
YEAH, I DID PICK OUT THIS ONE.

138
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,036
IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE HERE.

139
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,167
RED ANTS, RED ANT, RED ANTS.

140
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,043
OH, NO FREAKING WAY.

141
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,419
NO FREAKING WAY.

142
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:59,424
OH, MY GOD.

143
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,467
I KNEW IT!

144
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,012
THE IDOL IS BURIED AT THE FOOT

145
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,473
OF THIS TREE.

146
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,850
IN WAY.

147
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,687
IT'S THE IDOL.

148
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,067
WHAT IS THIS?

149
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,485
CONGRATULATION, YOU HAVE FOUND

150
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:19,902
THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

151
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,696
FIRST YOU WILL NEED A KEY TO

152
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,530
OPEN THIS BOX.

153
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,407
FOLLOW THE MAP TO THE TREE ON

154
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:24,991
THE MAP.

155
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,826
THE KEY IS JUST OUTSIDE OF YOUR

156
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,746
REACH.

157
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,581
FIRST YOU HAVE TO GET HIGH

158
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,958
ENOUGH.

159
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,001
DAMN, THAT'S A TRICK THEY'RE

160
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:35,585
GIVING ME.

161
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,794
I THOUGHT I GOT THE IDOL.

162
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,422
I LOOK UP AND IT'S A CLUE.

163
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,382
OH, NO.

164
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,592
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S A LOT OF

165
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,051
WORK.

166
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:43,634
I SAID, I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR

167
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,053
ANYTHING.

168
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:45,511
IT'S GETTING LATE.

169
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,763
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I

170
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,597
SPENT ALREADY.

171
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,182
HOPEFULLY THEY'RE STILL AT THE

172
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,558
BEACH.

173
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,517
WHAT IS A BLACK PALM?

174
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,604
DOES IT LOOK DIFFERENTLY?

175
00:05:54,687 --> 00:06:01,569
I SEE IT OVER HERE.

176
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,278
IT'S HIGH.

177
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,571
IT'S WAY ON TOP OF THE PALM

178
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,363
TREE.

179
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,948
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BITE THE

180
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:12,955
BULLET AND JUST GO FOR IT.

181
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,331
SLOWLY.

182
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,749
SLOWLY.

183
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,418
DON'T GO DOWN WHATEVER YOU DO.

184
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,377
OH, MY GOD.

185
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,754
THIS IS SO HIGH UP.

186
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:27,261
CAN I DOAIT?

187
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,180
OH, DEFINITELY TESTING ME.

188
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:29,806
OH, ALMOST THERE.

189
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,642
I CAN DO IT.

190
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,187
OH, NO.

191
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,480
I'M NOT DOING SO WELL.

192
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,982
THE PALM TREE IS LIKE SAND PAPER

193
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,692
SANDING BOTH MY THIGHS.

194
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,486
MY WHOLE CHEST IS BURNING.

195
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,779
THE BOTTOM OF MY FOOT IS

196
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,029
BLEEDING.

197
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,572
I'M THINKING, I CANNOT GET THE

198
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:46,781
IDOL.

199
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,742
I HAVE TO GET BACK BECAUSE I'VE

200
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,244
BEEN GONE TOO LONG NOW.

201
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:56,707
I HAVE TO GET BACK ANOTHER DAY.

202
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:27,446
>> ALL RIGHT.

203
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,240
>> I'M SO EXCITED THAT WE WON

204
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:29,532
KEROSENE.

205
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,741
WANT TO DO THE HONORS?

206
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,536
>> SURE.

207
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,705
I WAS A BIT OF A PYROMANIAC AS A

208
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,080
KID.

209
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,623
>> THERE YOU GO.

210
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,916
>> YEAH.

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,461
>> WHOA.

212
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,379
[CLAPPING]

213
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,715
>> OKAY, NEXT TIME A LITTLE LESS

214
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,424
KEROSENE.

215
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,135
>> IT FEELS SO AMAZING THAT THE

216
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,428
BRAINS TRIBE WON THE VERY FIRST

217
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:50,928
CHALLENGE OF THIS GAME.

218
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,347
WE'VE BEEN FEELING REALLY

219
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,558
COHESIVE AND TIGHT, AND THIS

220
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,476
VICTORY REALLY HAS SOLIDIFIED US

221
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:57,768
EVEN BETTER.

222
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:03,107
>> I'M THINKING WE SHOULD PUT ON

223
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:03,733
ANOTHER POT OF WATER.

224
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,359
>> AGREED.

225
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,237
ELISABETH IS A SMART GIRL,

226
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,530
HOWEVER, THE CHANCES OF THERE

227
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,240
BEING ORGANIC CHEMICALS HERE

228
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,783
THAT WE HAVE TO BOIL TO FITTER

229
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,785
THE WATER ARE VIRTUALLY SLIM TO

230
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,994
NONE.

231
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,414
I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH HER BOILED

232
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:18,873
WATER.

233
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,499
I'VE BEEN DRINKING THIS FROM THE

234
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,000
GET-GO.

235
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,418
IT'S IN MY REALM OF EXPERIENCE

236
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,836
TO BE ABLE TO JUDGE WATER JUST

237
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,712
BY LOOKING AT IT.

238
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,714
KEEP IN MIND I HAVE 20 YEARS

239
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,548
EXPERIENCE ANALYZING WATER.

240
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,009
>> I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT CRUCIAL

241
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:30,593
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL ALIVE AND

242
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,677
YOU'RE NOT DRINKING ANY TREATED

243
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,762
WATER.

244
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,596
>> NONE, NONE.

245
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,639
>> IT DOESN'T PROVE YOU HAVEN'T

246
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,141
PICKED UP ANY PAIR SITES.

247
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,684
>> JUST BECAUSE I HAVE AN IMMUNE

248
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,603
SYSTEM LIKE A HORSE DOESN'T MEAN

249
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:40,811
YOU DO.

250
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,688
>> I DON'T.

251
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,315
>> I DO.

252
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,401
I GREW UP AROUND PIGS, HORSE,

253
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:47,818
CATTLE, EVERYTHING.

254
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,695
>> DEBBIE MARCHES TO THE BEAT OF

255
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,404
HER OWN DRUM.

256
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,240
WHEN I FIRST SAW HER, DOES SHE

257
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,534
HAVE 30 CATS OR 40 CATS?

258
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,119
AND THE QUESTION, THE ANSWER IS

259
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,538
PROBABLY 40 CATS AT HER HOUSE

260
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:58,788
RIGHT NOW.

261
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,831
>> I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, WHEN I

262
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,707
PERSONAL TRAIN THEM, I SAY,

263
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,210
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE I CAN RUN TEN

264
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,586
MILES DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN OR

265
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,170
YOU SHOULD.

266
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,588
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO

267
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,590
LOSE A LOT OF WEIGHT SHOULD JUST

268
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,424
WALK, DON'T YOU AGREE?

269
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,468
>> OH, YEAH, STAY ACTIVE.

270
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,719
JOGGING AND ALSO WOMEN WITH

271
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,763
BOOBS SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING.

272
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:20,518
>> NUMBER ONE PERSONAL TRAINER.

273
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,436
NUMBER TWO, CHEMIST.

274
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:22,687
WHAT ELSE?

275
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,648
>> SHE RAISES TURTLES.

276
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,275
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A JOB,

277
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:27,483
THOUGH.

278
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,652
THAT'S A HOBBY.

279
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,529
I THINK DEBBIE WANTS TO PROVE

280
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,697
HOW STRONG AND COMPETENT AND

281
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,072
CAPABLE SHE IS.

282
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,448
>> WOW.

283
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,033
>> BUT SHE DOESN'T REALIZE THAT

284
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:36,701
ALL TALK, IF IT'S NOT BACKED UP

285
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,287
WITH ANYTHING, ISN'T GOING TO

286
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,371
GET HER ANYWHERE.

287
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,206
>> SO I THINK IT'S JUST YOU'VE

288
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,041
GOT GOOD HAND-EYE COORDINATION

289
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,583
OR YOU DON'T.

290
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:44,834
>> YEAH.

291
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,046
YOU APPARENTLY HAVE AMAZING

292
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,505
HAND-EYE COORDINATION.

293
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,173
>> I THINK I HAVE FAIRLY GOOD.

294
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,175
>> DEBBIE IS NOT EXHIBITING MUCH

295
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,593
GAME PLAY WHATSOEVER, SO SHE'S

296
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,095
THE PERSON YOU WANT ON YOUR

297
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:56,304
TEAM.

298
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:01,684
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, A BRAIN TO

299
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,768
HAVE NO GAME.

300
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,979
I'M KEEPING DEBBIE AROUND AS

301
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:12,653
LONG AS I CAN.

302
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,573
>> THIS IS BREAKFAST SUGAR.

303
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,658
>> IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE EATING

304
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,117
CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH.

305
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,785
>> YOU REALLY HAVE THE APPETITE

306
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,038
OF A CHILD.

307
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:22,621
>> CUTE.

308
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,789
>> YOU LIKE THAT?

309
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:30,296
>> VERY CHILD-LIKE.

310
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,841
LOOK AT THE MAN HOLDING THAT.

311
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,468
I'M PAYING THEM A COMPLIMENT.

312
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,677
TRUST ME, IT IS.

313
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,847
>> I KNOW YOU'RE SWEET, NEXT TO

314
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,014
YOU.

315
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,849
>> IF I WANT TO GET THE IDOL, I

316
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,476
HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK, BUT

317
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,852
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT

318
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:45,102
DOING IT.

319
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,563
SO I THINK I'M GOING TO LAY LOW

320
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,690
BECAUSE I THINK MAYBE MY CHARM,

321
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,232
MY PERSONALITY WILL HELP ME

322
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,360
CONNECT WITH THE PEOPLE IN MY

323
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:52,693
TRIBE.

324
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:58,991
>>I MISSED YOU LAST NIGHT.

325
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,785
MY BOYFRIEND LIKES THAT.

326
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,287
>> HE'S LIKE, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

327
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,706
>> WHERE I'M FROM YOU DON'T SEE

328
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,248
TAI.

329
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,666
HE'S NOT THE AVERAGE COUNTRY

330
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,125
GUY.

331
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:08,918
FIRST NIGHT I WAS HERE, TAI,

332
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,963
HEY, MAN, I'M COLD, CAN I CUDDLE

333
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,548
YOU TO WARM UP.

334
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,758
YEAH, MAN, YOU CAN HOLD ME THE

335
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,175
WARM UP.

336
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,968
THERE IS NO SUCH THING IN

337
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,011
HOMOPHOBE IN THIS GUY RIGHT

338
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:19,470
HERE.

339
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,971
I LIKE HANGING OUT WITH HIM

340
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,431
BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF A KIND FOR

341
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,934
SURE.

342
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,477
>> IT'S A HORNET.

343
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:26,894
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

344
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,105
HE'S JUST LOOKING FOR FOOD.

345
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,107
>> WELL, HE'S GOING TO LOOK FOR

346
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,440
FOOD ON MY FOOT.

347
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,361
>> NO REASON TO KILL ANYTHING.

348
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,905
>> IT'S A FRICKEN BEE, DUBAI.

349
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,909
>> CALEB AND TAI ARE<i> THE</i> MOST

350
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,452
DIFFERENT PEOPLE I'VE MET IN MY

351
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:43,786
LIFE.

352
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,038
CALEB IS A COUNTRY BOY, A

353
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:46,288
HUNTER.

354
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,374
>> YOU'D GET MAD AT ME IF I KILL

355
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,166
A BEE?

356
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,417
>> YEAH.

357
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,461
>> TAI IS A GARDENER WHO IS SO

358
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,587
CONCERNED ABOUT ANIMALS AND THE

359
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:53,879
ENVIRONMENT.

360
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,714
>> IT WAS HERE BEFORE YOU MOVED.

361
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:55,965
YOU MOVED.

362
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,299
>> IT'S MY HOUSE

363
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,426
HE NEEDS TO GO SOMEWHERE.

364
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,387
>> THEY ARE TWO TOTALLY

365
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,973
DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES THAT YOU

366
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,057
WOULDN'T THINK CONNECT, BUT

367
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,851
SOMEHOW THEY GET EACH OTHER.

368
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,186
>> CALEB, I DARE YOU.

369
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,312
>> OH, YOU DARED ME.

370
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,859
>> OH, BOY.

371
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,943
>> YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR MOUTH.

372
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:20,448
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

373
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,157
THERE'S THE BALL.

374
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,116
NO, NOT FOR YOU?

375
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,617
IT'S PROTEIN, MY FRIEND.

376
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,911
>> PROTEIN MY FOOT.

377
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,789
>> THE BROMANCE IS REAL OUT

378
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,790
HERE.

379
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,000
THEY BICKER LIKE A MARRY COUPLE

380
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,919
AND THEN THEY KISS AND MAKE UP.

381
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,632
>> TAKE THE WHOLE THING.

382
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,009
GET SOME.

383
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:40,885
>> YOU TRIED TO KISS ME.

384
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,137
>> NO, I DID NOT.

385
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,512
I TRIED TO BITE.

386
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,766
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT.

387
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,729
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT.

388
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,148
>> I WAS TOTALLY GOING FOR THE

389
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,232
KISS, JUST TO SHOCK HIM AND

390
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,150
TEASE HIM.

391
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:56,901
I KNOW HE CAN TAKE IT.

392
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,069
I THINK HE LIKES IT A LITTLE

393
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,321
BIT.

394
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,655
I HOPE I DON'T GET YOU IN

395
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:01,864
TROUBLE.

396
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,324
>> NEXT TIME JUST ASK.

397
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:08,037
>> OKAY.

398
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,246
>> NO.

399
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,137
>> WE NEED TO KEEP THIS STUFF

400
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:25,971
COVERED SO IT WILL DRY OUT.

401
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,932
LET ME SEE HOW MUCH FUEL IS

402
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,267
LEFT.

403
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,811
>> WHERE THE HELL DID IT GO?

404
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,605
>> THE RUBBER SEAL?

405
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,940
>> THE SEAL'S GONE.

406
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,066
>> IT'S BEEN LEAKING.

407
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,234
>> WE REALLY NEED THAT.

408
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,110
>> THE KEROSENE IS FRUSTRATING

409
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,071
BECAUSE WE STARTED WITH THIS

410
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:42,863
LITTLE VERY VALUABLE JAR.

411
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,491
JOE PUT ONE-THIRD OF IT ON THE

412
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,035
FIRE AND THEN LET IT TIP ON ITS

413
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,787
SIDE, AND WE LOST MOST OF IT.

414
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,871
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE

415
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,248
DON'T HAVE OUR FIRE IS WE'RE

416
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,749
GOING TO DRINK FROM THE WELL AND

417
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,962
PEOPLE COULD GET SICK.

418
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,131
>> I KEEP THROWING THINGS DOWN

419
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,091
FOR THESE GUYS TO TRIP OVER.

420
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,218
IT'S WHAT I LOVED ABOUT YOU.

421
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,886
I SAID, GIVE ME THE DISCIPLINED

422
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,053
GUY.

423
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,973
>> THERE IS PRACTICALITY IN

424
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,515
BEING HERE.

425
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,433
I WOULD SAY THE TWO MOST

426
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,059
PRACTICAL PEOPLE ARE DEBBIE AND

427
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,310
ME.

428
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,562
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE LEFT.

429
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,146
I HAVE A LOT OF SURVIVAL SKILLS

430
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,481
HAVING A MILITARY BACKGROUND,

431
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,107
AND THE REST OF THE PEOPLE, I

432
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,150
THINK THEY HAVE BOOK KNOWLEDGE,

433
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:26,991
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

434
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,159
THESE ARE WET.

435
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,160
THESE GUYS ARE SHOT.

436
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:30,911
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME?

437
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,122
>> I WAS PRETTY UPSET ABOUT THE

438
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,207
FIRE BECAUSE I WAS DYING FOR

439
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,293
SOME FRESHLY BOILED WATER, AND

440
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:42,089
JOE WASTED A LOT OF KEROSENE AND

441
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:42,631
DESTROYED MOST OF THE REST.

442
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,467
>> MAYBE IF WE DROP A SMOKING

443
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,760
EMBER INTO SOME KINDLE.

444
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,095
>> I'M TAKING CARE OF IT, LIZ,

445
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,305
OKAY.

446
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,265
LIZ IS BECOMING KIND OF A PAIN

447
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,266
IN A BUTT.

448
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,267
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT

449
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,559
EVERYTHING.

450
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,477
IT'S LIKE, COME ON ALREADY,

451
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:55,686
PLEASE.

452
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,688
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL ANY

453
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:57,980
BACTERIA.

454
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,858
>> THERE'S PATHOGENS IN IT.

455
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,317
PATHOGENS MIGHT BITE.

456
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,069
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

457
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,864
EVERYTHING LIZ KNOWS IS BOOK

458
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,781
KNOWLEDGE FROM STRINGING

459
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,116
TOGETHER A ROD TO GET COCONUTS

460
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,038
TO SPRINKLING ANT DUST TO

461
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,081
PREVENT ANT ATTACKS TO MAKING

462
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,541
WATER FILTER THINGS THAT DON'T

463
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:17,750
WORK.

464
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,001
IT'S LIKE I'M AT KINDERGARTEN

465
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:23,505
CAMP AND IT'S JUST IRRITATING.

466
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,507
>> I'M FEELING EMOTIONAL JUST

467
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,884
BECAUSE I'M PHYSICALLY VERY WEAK

468
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,176
RIGHT NOW.

469
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,554
AND JOE DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE OR

470
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,180
APPRECIATE THAT I REALLY NEED A

471
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:36,185
FIRE GOING.

472
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,103
I HATE BEING EMOTIONAL.

473
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,147
I HATE ALLOWING MYSELF TO NOT DO

474
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,982
THE LOGICAL THING AT EVERY GIVEN

475
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,109
POINT.

476
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,945
I KNOW THAT I'M CAPABLE OF BEING

477
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,197
PATIENT AND CALM UNTIL I CAN GET

478
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,406
SOME WATER IN ME.

479
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,283
SO I JUST NEED TO LIKE HIDE

480
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,993
MYSELF FOR A LITTLE BIT UNTIL

481
00:15:53,077 --> 00:16:04,088
THE FIRE IS GOING.

482
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,518
>> I'M TIRED.

483
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,353
I JUST HAVE NO ENERGY BECAUSE I

484
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,107
HAVE NO FUEL.

485
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,149
>> I'M SUCKING ALL THE WAY

486
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,275
AROUND.

487
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,319
>> EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG FOR

488
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:27,695
THE BRAWN TRIBE.

489
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,029
WE CAN'T MAKE A FIRE.

490
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,323
WE DON'T HAVE FRESH WIRE.

491
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,199
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO

492
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:32,574
EFFECT.

493
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,328
WE MIGHT LOOK BRAWNY.

494
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,831
WE ARE WEAKLINGS AT THIS POINT,

495
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,164
WEAKLINGS.

496
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,417
>> DAMN, YOU GOT BLISTERS.

497
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,167
>> BUBBLES.

498
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,253
I THOUGHT IT WAS SWEAT.

499
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:44,712
REALLY BAD.

500
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,213
>> MY SHOULDERS ARE FRIED.

501
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,381
MY SHINS ARE FRIED.

502
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,258
MY THIGHS ARE FRIED.

503
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,344
BUT I WAS IN IRAQ AND

504
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,512
AFGHANISTAN, SO I CAN LIVE WITH

505
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:53,679
IT.

506
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,932
I CAN EMBRACE THE SUCK OF.

507
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:57,975
THIS I'M USED TO THE SUCK.

508
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,184
I JUST KEEP CHALKING IT UP TO

509
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,103
ANOTHER HORRIBLE DAY.

510
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,106
LET'S MOVE ON.

511
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,357
BUT FOR NOW I NEED THE STAY IN

512
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,861
THE SHADE.

513
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,779
>> AT THIS POINT I KIND OF FEEL

514
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,614
LIKE I'M AT THE BOTTOM, BUT I

515
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,074
DON'T BELIEVE IN QUITTING.

516
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,284
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GIVING UP.

517
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,118
SO I NEED TO SHOW THEM WHY THEY

518
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,537
SHOULD KEEP ME IN THE GAME.

519
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,621
AND I'M GOING TO KEEP TRYING

520
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,208
UNTIL I SEE FLAMES.

521
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,587
>> WHY IS SHE TRYING TO DO THAT?

522
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,213
>> I THINK SHE'S JUST WORRIED.

523
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:36,680
>> DON'T DOUBT HER RIGHT NOW.

524
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,519
>> NOT ONE THING HAS GONE RIGHT.

525
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,187
WE'RE HERE IN MISERY LAUGHING

526
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:57,576
OUR ASSES OFF.

527
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:03,874
>> OH, MY GOSH.

528
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,876
>> I'VE BEEN OVER THERE BY

529
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:06,502
MYSELF TRYING TO MAKE THE FIRE

530
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,002
ALL DAY.

531
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,380
AND I LOOK OVER, AND THE HIT MAN

532
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,633
AND THE NBA PLAYER ARE HAVING

533
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,425
NAP TIME.

534
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:19,598
AND IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING.

535
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:19,848
GOT FIRE.

536
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,308
I GOT FIRE!

537
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,601
IT'S GOING OUT.

538
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,186
>> KEEP BLOWING, KEEP BLOWING,

539
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:38,659
KEEP BLOWING.

540
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,785
>> THIS IS GOING.

541
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,285
THIS IS GOING.

542
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,245
>> WE NEED BABY STICKS.

543
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,413
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED, BABY

544
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,290
STICKS.

545
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:51,171
>> GOOD GIRL.

546
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,965
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

547
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:53,966
>> THANK YOU.

548
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:54,216
THANK YOU.

549
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,342
>> ONE THING I LOVE ABOUT

550
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,553
ALICIA, SHE'S NOT A QUITTER.

551
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,095
SHE'S TOUGH.

552
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,304
THAT BOOSTED HER SELF-ESTEEM SO

553
00:18:59,388 --> 00:18:59,930
MUCH.

554
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,392
SHE JUST SO BADLY WANTED TO

555
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,852
CONTRIBUTE IN SUCH A HUGE WAY.

556
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,145
WE NEED PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

557
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,355
>> HEAT TONIGHT!

558
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,357
>> THIS FIRE HAS SAVED US.

559
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,068
SCOTT, HERE'S YOUR PIECE.

560
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:13,360
HERE YOU GO.

561
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,612
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

>> CALEB, YOU'RE GOOD.

752
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:06,880
CALEB, YOU'RE GOOD.

753
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:07,672
>> Jeff: YOU GOT TO PULL THAT

754
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,548
ROPE BACK IN.

755
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,592
>> HERE WE GO.

756
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:15,222
NO THERE GOES CALEB.

757
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:15,931

759
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,225
BEAUTY TRIBE.

760
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:18,808
ONE MORE.

761
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,519
>> WE GOT TO GET THE ROPE UP.

762
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,019
COME ON.

763
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,270
UP HERE.

764
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,023
>> COME ON!

765
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,901
>> Jeff: BRAINS TRIBE HAS MADE

766
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,653
UP A LOT OF TIME.

767
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,614
>> YES!

768
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,907
>> Jeff: CALEB LAUNCHES AND

769
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,033
HITS FOR THE BRAINS TRIBE.

770
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,953
WE ARE TIED 1-1.

771
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,745
HERE GOES SCOT FOR THE BRAWN

772
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,955
TRIBE.

773
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,623
SCOTT CONNECTS FOR THE BRAWN

774
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,457
TRIBE.

775
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,878
ONE TARGET LEFT FOR EACH TRIBE.

776
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,840
EITHER COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

777
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,300
THE BRAIN TRIBE FALLS SHORT.

778
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,218
>> OH, BABY.

779
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:53,802
>> Jeff: OPENS THE DOOR FOR

780
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,636

CALEB FOR THE WIN.

782
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,641
YES!

783
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:05,146
BEAUTY WINS IMMUNITY AND REWARD.

784
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,232
IT'S NOW DOWN TO BRAWN AND

785
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,192
BRAINS FOR SECOND PLACE.

786
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,945
IF YOU FUMBLE, IT WILL COST YOU.

787
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,947
I WILL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

788
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,614
>> GO.

789
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,282
GET IT.

790
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,241
PUT IT BACK DOWN.

791
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:16,741
IT'S TANGLED UP.

792
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,868
>> Jeff: THIS SHOT COULD WIN

793
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,036
IT RIGHT HERE FOR THE BRAWN

794
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,456

JUST MISSES.

00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,170
BRAWN IS HUSTLING TO GET ANOTHER

797
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:34,926
SHOT IN.

798
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,553

799
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,097

807
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:00,869

CONGRATULATIONS.

IMMUNITY ONCE AGAIN.

810
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,835
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

811
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,963
BRAIN TRIBE, SAME RESULT,

ULTIMATE FISHING KIT, THIS

815
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:20,847

00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,558
COME GET IT, HEAD BACK TO CAMP,

817
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,270
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

BRAIN TRIBE, GOOD WORK FOR YOU,

819
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:31,232
AS WELL.

820
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,275
COME GET IT.

821
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,194
IT'S A SMALLER FISHING KIT, BUT

822
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,195
IT WILL GET THE JOB DONE.

823
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,321
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

824
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,197
>> Jeff: GOOD EFFORT.

00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,407
NOBODY GOING HOME.

827
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,742
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

828
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,036

831
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,665
SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BE VOTED OUT

832
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,375
OF THIS GAME.

833
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:48,917
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

834
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,919
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

835
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,962
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

836
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:53,213
COUNCIL.

837
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,090
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN AS

838
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,591
THE WORST TRIBE IN HISTORY.

839
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,468
LET ME TELL YOU, OUR SHIP IS

840
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,928
SINKING AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO

841
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,013
THAT RECORD.

842
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,417
>> I MISSED.

843
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:30,708
IT HAPPENS.

844
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,835
>> I DON'T CHALK THAT UP TO YOU.

845
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,337
>> I'M IN THE SAYING I'M TAKING

846
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,006
ALL THE BLAME, BUT IF WE

847
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,298
CONNECTED...

848
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:37,715
>> AND WE DIDN'T.

849
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,426
>> AND WE DIDN'T.

850
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,427
WE LOST THE CHALLENGE.

851
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,222
WE'RE GOING TO TRIBAL... AGAIN.

852
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,599
FORTUNATELY JASON, CYDNEY, JENNY

853
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,435
AND MICE, WE'RE STRONG.

854
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,978
WE GENUINELY LIKE EACH OTHER.

855
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,604
I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF ONE OF US

856
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,355
TURNED.

857
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,022
THAT LEAVES ALECIA.

858
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,025
>> WE ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT WHAT

859
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,569
ALECIA DOES AND WHAT WE ALLOWED

860
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:02,157
HER TO DO WAS UNTIE A KNOT.

861
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,408
WE KNOW WHAT SHE BRINGS TO THE

862
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,994
TABLE.

863
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,914
>> BLONDIE, SHE'S A DITZ AND A

864
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,375
HALF, A DITZ.

865
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,335
I'M SURE SHE'S GOT A GOOD HEART,

866
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,211
BUT SHE'S JUST DUMB.

867
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,379
SHE'S ALWAYS CONFUSED.

868
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,131
SHE'S LIKE AN OSTRICH.

869
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,799
SHE'S A BIRD, BUT SHE CAN'T FLY,

870
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,301
SO SHE'S USELESS.

871
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:31,811
SO YOU GOT TO GET RID OF HER.

872
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,563
>> THERE SHEZ XI GOES.

873
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,857
SHE LOOKED BACK FIVE TIMES.

874
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,108
IT MAKES EVERYBODY ELSE GO,

875
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:37,775
OKAY.

876
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,818
WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR

877
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,736
SURE.

878
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:49,537
>> SHE'LL NEVER FIND IT.

879
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,872
>> IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR A

880
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,332
NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK.

881
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:52,874
I'M GETTING A LITTLE WORRIED

882
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,000
ABOUT TRIBAL TONIGHT BECAUSE NOT

883
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,127
ONCE DID ANY OF THEM ASK ME TO

884
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,045
BE IN AN ALLIANCE WITH THEM, SO

885
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,047
I GUESS THAT'S TELLING ME

886
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,882
SOMETHING.

887
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,843
THERE'S STILL A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

888
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,430
IDOL OUT THERE, BUT WHERE IT IS,

889
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:07,764
NOBODY KNOWS.

890
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,307
>> SHE'S STILL OUT SEARCHING?

891
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:09,557
>> YEP.

892
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,643
>> SHE'S JUST SO STUPID.

893
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,394
EVERY DAY SHE BLOWS MY MIND A

894
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,270
LITTLE BIT MORE.

895
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,273
>> OH, BOY.

896
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,317
>> I HAD AN ALLIANCE IN THE

897
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,610
BEGINNING, BUT IT'S FUNNY WHAT

898
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,237
SIX DAYS OUT HERE DOES TO YOU.

899
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,404
YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW PEOPLE

900
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:23,988
FOR WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY

901
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,865
ARE, AND TO BE HONEST, JASON IS

902
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,033
STARTING TO PISS ME OFF.

903
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,827
I DON'T LIKE HIS ATTITUDE.

904
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,496
HE JUST SITS AROUND AND DOESN'T

905
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,872
DO ANYTHING EXCEPT TALK ABOUT

906
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,499
ALECIA, AND I'M TIRED OF IT.

907
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,834
>> OKAY, BLONDIE.

908
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,420
>> BLONDIE.

909
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:39,879
>> JENNY?

910
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,672
>> UH-HUH.

911
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,883
>> LET'S DO IT.

912
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,134
>> THAT'S REALLY CLOSE.

913
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:45,969
>> IT LOOK LIKE IT LANDED IN

914
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:53,476
THERE.

915
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,647
>> BALLOONDY.

916
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,274
>> ALECIA, WHAT'S THE BEST THING

917
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,944
WE CAN DO?

918
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,113
>> THAT'S NOT THE BEST THING YOU

919
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,406
CAN DO.

920
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:06,906
WIN A CHALLENGE?

921
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,115
>> NO.

922
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,952
THAT'S NOT IT EITHER.

923
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,247
>> I WAS THINKING, YOU GUYS CAN

924
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,124
DO IT EASY AND HELP ME OUT,

925
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,125
RIGHT?

926
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,752
WE CAN VOTE OUT ONE OF THE GUYS.

927
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,420
>> YES.

928
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,630
>> US GIRLS WILL STAY STRONG.

929
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,423
WE'LL MAKE THE MERGE.

930
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,882
WHEN WE MAKE THE MERGE, THEY GO

931
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,301
AFTER GUYS LIKE THEM, AND

932
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,760
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AN

933
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,011
ALLIANCE.

934
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:28,928
SO IF YOU GO US WITH, WE HAVE A

935
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,096
BETTER CHANCE OF NOT GETTING

936
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:30,388
PICKED OFF.

937
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,557
>> VERY GOOD POINT.

938
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,434
>> IT'S FUNNY HOW QUICK THINGS

939
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,560
CHANGE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS

940
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,978
GOING HOME, AND THEN JEN'S LIKE,

941
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,273
HEY, LET'S DO AN ALL-GIRLS

942
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:40,523
ALLIANCE.

943
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,983
>> MY GUT HAS BEEN TELLING ME TO

944
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,192
DO THIS ALL ALONG.

945
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,737
I'VE BEEN IGNORING MY GUT

946
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,488
BECAUSE I GAVE MY WORD.

947
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,698
NOW JASON IS JUST PISSING ME

948
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:48,865
OFF.

949
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,158
>> HE'S ANNOYING.

950
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,409
WE THINK WE NEED THE GUYS, WHICH

951
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,243
WE DO.

952
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,953
WE CAN KNOCK OFF JASON AND WE'LL

953
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,538
HAVE SCOTT FOR THE NEXT TWO

954
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:55,830
CHALLENGES.

955
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:58,166
>> LISTEN, YOU'RE ABSENT MINDED

956
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,917
AND YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY, BUT I

957
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,293
LIKE YOU.

958
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,337
THIS GAME IS ABOUT BIG MOVES.

959
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,796
IF THIS WORKS AND JASON GOES

960
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,048
HOME TONIGHT INSTEAD OF ME, I

961
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,299
WOULD BE REALLY EXCITED.

962
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,176
I MIGHT EVEN THIS A LITTLE HAPPY

963
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:08,635
DANCE.

964
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:13,056
I'M GOING TO BE STOKED.

965
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,391
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT THEY'RE

966
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,643
TOGETHER.

967
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,269
>> THERE'S IN BREAKING UP OUR

968
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,063
FOUR.

969
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:25,276
>> I WORRY ABOUT THAT.

970
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,028
>> 100%.

971
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:27,195
100%.

972
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:34,118
>> OKAY.

973
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,370
>> WE'RE GOOD, RIGHT?

974
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:40,625
>> OF COURSE.

975
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,002
>> HE'S A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.

976
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,881
THE LAST THING I WANT IS HIM

977
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:47,215
QUESTIONING...

978
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,174
>> I HAVE THIS THING, THEY CALL

979
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,843
IT LOW-IMPULSE CONTROL.

980
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,137
I CHASE SHINY OBJECTS.

981
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,681
SOMETIMES WHEN I HEAR IDEAS, I

982
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,223
THINK, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

983
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,724
LET'S DO THAT.

984
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,394
THEN I REALIZE BLINDSIDING JASON

985
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,854
IS ALSO ME BLINDSIDING SCOT, AND

986
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,107
I ACTUALLY LIKE SCOT, AND HE

987
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:04,399
TRUSTS ME.

988
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:15,243
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

989
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,204
>> I'M CONFUSED.

990
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,456
>> I'M ASKING YOU.

991
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,333
I CAN GO EITHER WAY RIGHT NOW.

992
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,084
LET'S THINK ABOUT IT.

993
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,920
MY GUT WAS TO GO ALL GIRL, BUT

994
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:26,504
NOW I DON'T KNOW.

995
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,424
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO...

996
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,175
>> I WAS GETTING AHEAD OF

997
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:31,634
MYSELF.

998
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,093
WE CAN DO THAT LATER.

999
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,930
I'M LIKE, WHAT IS GOING ON?

1000
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,974
LIKE WHEN DID THIS TIDE TURN?

1001
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:38,933
THE GIRLS ARE ALL OVER THE

1002
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:39,100
PLACE.

1003
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,226
>> I'M SORRY.

1004
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,853
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE WISHY-WASHY.

1005
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,438
>> SHE'S GOT SOME BALLS GOING

1006
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,522
BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT.

1007
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,732
EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND

1008
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,275
SOMETHING IS GOING ON, BUT ALL I

1009
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,735
KNOW IT'S UP IN THE AIR AT THIS

1010
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,318
POINT.

1011
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,486
AND THAT'S A VERY, VERY

1012
00:33:50,570 --> 00:34:08,004
DANGEROUS WAY TO GO TO TRIBAL.

1013
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,639
>> Jeff: ALECIA, LAST TRIBAL

1014
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,932
COUNCIL IT WAS YOUR OR DARNELL.

1015
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,685
DID YOU FEEL HEAT, OH, GREAT,

1016
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:22,977
NOW IT'S ME.

1017
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,854
>> THEY DID SAY I WAS WEAK IN

1018
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,397
THE CHALLENGE, BUT SINCE THEN

1019
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,732
I'VE DONE WELL AND PULLED MY

1020
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,357
WEIGHT AROUND CAMP, SO HOPEFULLY

1021
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,818
IT WILL NOT BE ME TONIGHT.

1022
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,278
>> Jeff: JENNY, SIX DAYS IN,

1023
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,238
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TRIBAL

1024
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,114
COULD GO TONIGHT.

1025
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,282
YOU COULD BE PLAYING THE LONG

1026
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,325
GAME.

1027
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,494
>> RIGHT.

1028
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,037
>> Jeff: OR ALLIANCES TAKE

1029
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,040
OVER, OR YOU COULD EASILY SAY

1030
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,334
THREE WOMEN, PICK OFF ONE OF THE

1031
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,002
THREE GUYS, LET'S STICK

1032
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:48,294
TOGETHER.

1033
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,004
>> IT WAS DEFINITELY UP IN THE

1034
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,172
AIR AFTER YOU HEAR A COUPLE

1035
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,131
DIFFERENT STORIES, YOU HAVE TO

1036
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,216
THINK, WOW, THAT MIGHT MAKE

1037
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,051
SENSE.

1038
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,303
OH, DAMN, THIS ISN'T AS SOLID AS

1039
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:57,929
I THOUGHT.

1040
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,513
SO THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOME

1041
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:04,352
BACK AND FORTH, WHAT DO WE DO.

1042
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,562
>> Jeff: SCOTT, WHY THE BIG

1043
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:06,854
REACTION?

1044
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,940
>> TO HEAR JENNY SAY I WAS UP IN

1045
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,192
THE AIR AT CAMP, MY EYEBROWS ARE

1046
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:11,859
UP.

1047
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,152
NOW I'M WONDERING.

1048
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:13,319
EN.

1049
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:13,903
>> Jeff: WOW.

1050
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,321
JUST LIKE THAT, JASON, THE GAME

1051
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:15,655
TURNS.

1052
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,322
>> THAT'S PART OF THIS GAME IS

1053
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,658
THAT IT TURNS ON THE DROP OF A

1054
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:18,950
DIME.

1055
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:19,534
IT'S A CLASSIC WHAT HAPPENS

1056
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,702
AFTER YOU LOSE CHALLENGE, AND

1057
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,370
YOU'RE GETTING READY TO GO THE

1058
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:22,703
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1059
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,748
THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF THAT

1060
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,125
GETS OUT AND WHO FINDS OUT WHAT

1061
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,001
YOU JUST SAID AND THEN YOU COME

1062
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:29,502
TO TRIBAL AND THINGS GET

1063
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,045
CONFIRMED.

1064
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,549
>> THINGS YOU THINK GET

1065
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:34,799
CONFIRMED.

1066
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,717
BUT THE TRUTH IS, YES, IDEAS

1067
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,386
WERE THROWN AROUND, BUT YOU GUYS

1068
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,971
ALL ASSUME BECAUSE ANOTHER IDEA

1069
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,515
WAS DISCUSSED THAT THE PLAN WAS

1070
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:42,723
CHANGED.

1071
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,350
>> I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING HAD

1072
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,893
CHANGED UNTIL I JUST HEARD YOU

1073
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,395
RIGHT HERE SAY, YEAH, BACK AT

1074
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,146
CAMP EVERYTHING WAS UP IN THE

1075
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,313
AIR.

1076
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,440
AS FAR AS YOU TOLD ME AT CAMP

1077
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,401
THIS AFTERNOON, THE PLAN WAS IN.

1078
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,110
IT WAS DONE.

1079
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,405
>> AT THAT POINT IT WAS.

1080
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,197
>> WOW.

1081
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,824
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS GOING TO

1082
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,909
TURN THAT QUICKLY BECAUSE I

1083
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,743
ADMITTED IDEAS WERE DISCUSSED.

1084
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,370
>> YOU HAVE AN ALLIANCE, YOU GO

1085
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,413
SOMEPLACE TOGETHER AND YOU NEVER

1086
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,205
WAIVER.

1087
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,541
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE

1088
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:14,672
DONE UP TO THIS POINT.

1089
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,048
>> Jeff: WOW.

1090
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,133
ALECIA, WHAT DO YOU TAKE FROM

1091
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:17,466
THAT?

1092
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,344
>> THAT SOUNDED LIKE THEY HAD

1093
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,305
SOMETHING LOCKED IN AND JENNY

1094
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,931
SAID IT'S UP IN THE AIR THAT.

1095
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,432
RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

1096
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,560
>> SO WHY NOT LET THIS BE

1097
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,145
COMPLETELY HONEST.

1098
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,689
ALECIA CAME TO ME AND SAID,

1099
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:36,944
LET'S DO AN ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE.

1100
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,031
>> THAT WAS JEN'S IDEA.

1101
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,324
>> YOU SAID, JEN...

1102
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,241
>> SHE WAS THE ONE TRYING TO GET

1103
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,744
US TO HAVE AN ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE.

1104
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:45,912
>> NEW YORK I WAS NOT.

1105
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,537
NO I WAS NOT.

1106
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,247
>> WHO DID YOU SAY TO THROW ON

1107
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,165
THAT CHOPPING BLOCK.

1108
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:49,999
>> JASON.

1109
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,085
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1110
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,712
>> Jeff: THAT'S EVERYTHING

1111
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,129
BUSTED RIGHT THERE.

1112
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,381
>> AGAIN, IT WAS ALICIA'S IDEA.

1113
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,008
>> WHATEVER YOU SAY, JENNY.

1114
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,468
>> BUT WHERE IS THAT GOING TO

1115
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,177
GET ME?

1116
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,428
VOTE ME OUT AND LET'S KEEP

1117
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,346
LOSING CHALLENGES.

1118
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,972
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA.

1119
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:05,514
VOTE OUT ONE OF THE STRONGER

1120
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,477
MEMBERS OF THE TEAM.

1121
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,020
>> Jeff: CYD, WHAT DO YOU MAKE

1122
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,270
OF THIS?

1123
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,272
>> I THINK IT'S ABOUT BEING IN

1124
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:13,814
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

1125
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,941
TIME AND SAYING THE WRONG THING

1126
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,567
AT THE WRONG TIME TO THE WRONG

1127
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,151
PEOPLE.

1128
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,362
I THINK THAT'S WHERE LOYALTY

1129
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,655
COMES IN.

1130
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,322
THERE IS NO PLACE THE HIDE.

1131
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,366
YOU HAVE TO KNOW...

1132
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,034
>> IF I BROKE YOUR TRUST, THAT'S

1133
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:25,868
MY BAD.

1134
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,328
BUT WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS A

1135
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,038
TRIBE THAT WANTS TO WIN AND NOT

1136
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,666
HAVE TO COME BACK HERE.

1137
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,250
IF YOU STICK WITH HER, YOU'RE

1138
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:33,709
GOING TO BE BACK HERE.

1139
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,335
>> I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG IN

1140
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,337
THE CHALLENGE THAT MADE US LOSE,

1141
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,714
NOT ONE THING.

1142
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,465
>> LET ME ADDRESS SOMETHING.

1143
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,509
NEVER IN THIS GAME HAS SOMEONE

1144
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,260
WALKED UP TO THEIR ALLIANCE AND

1145
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,845
WENT, GUYS, JUST WANT YOU TO

1146
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,305
KNOW, I'M CONSIDERING A FLIP.

1147
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,140
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU, LET YOU

1148
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:48,683
KNOW HOW THINGS WORK OUT.

1149
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,811
IF IT DOESN'T, HEY, WE'RE STILL

1150
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,104
GOOD, RIGHT?

1151
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:53,521
ALL RIGHT.

1152
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:53,938
COOL.

1153
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,524
AND THEN GO AWAY.

1154
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,777
>> Jeff: JENNY, IS THIS AN

1155
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,069
ABSOLUTE...

1156
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,153
>> NIGHTMARE?

1157
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,613
>> Jeff: NIGHTMARE, YEAH?

1158
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,824
>> JEFF, THE PAIN IS THEM NOT

1159
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,116
TRUSTING ME.

1160
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,659
THAT'S THE PAIN.

1161
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,368
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST SIX DAYS I

1162
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,745
HAVE GIVEN THEM NO REASON NOT TO

1163
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,037
TRUST ME.

1164
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,581
ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE PERSON, WHO

1165
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:13,332
BY THE WAY IS AT THE BOTTOM, IS

1166
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,584
DOING ALL THIS SCRAMBLING AND

1167
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,252
TELLING THEM LIES.

1168
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,420
>> I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

1169
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,547
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1170
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,381
>> Jeff: HONESTLY I HAVEN'T

1171
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,842
LISTENED TO A WORD ALECIA HAS

1172
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,050
SAID.

1173
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,844
I'VE JUST BEEN LISTENING TO YOU.

1174
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,137
FIRST WORDS OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

1175
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,304
WERE, YEAH, EVERYTHING'S UP IN

1176
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,514
THE AIR, I DON'T KNOW.

1177
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,515
MAKE ME GET OVER THAT.

1178
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,349
>> OKAY.

1179
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,393
MY INTENTIONS WERE NOTHING BUT

1180
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,185
GOOD.

1181
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,312
I ACTUALLY LIKE ALECIA.

1182
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,148
IT WAS TO GIVE HER A GOOD LAST

1183
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:37,732
DAY AND NOT THINK SHE'S GOING

1184
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,693
HOME THE MAKE HER COMFORTABLE, I

1185
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,444
DIDN'T SEE...

1186
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,528
>> LYING TO ME IS NOT GIVING ME

1187
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,946
A GOOD LAST DAY.

1188
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,823
>> I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE BEST

1189
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,241
DECISION OR RIGHT DECISION.

1190
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,492
THAT'S WHO I AM AT A PERSON.

1191
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,327
I CARE ABOUT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

1192
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,370
IF THERE'S SOMETHING I COULD

1193
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,496
TAKE BACK, THAT WOULD BE IT.

1194
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,707
>> Jeff: SCOTT, WHAT'S YOUR

1195
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,416
REACTION WHEN YOU HEAR JENNY

1196
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,793
SAY, I'D DO ANYTHING TO TAKE IT

1197
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,002
BACK.

1198
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,378
I'D DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE IT.

1199
00:38:59,462 --> 00:38:59,754
I WISH I COULD.

1200
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,588
YOU SEE THAT EMOTION.

1201
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,215
DO YOU HAVE EMPATHY AT THAT

1202
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:03,549
POINT?

1203
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,259
>> YEAH, I UNDERSTAND

1204
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:05,593
MISSPEAKING.

1205
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,677
I'VE DONE IT MYSELF ONCE OR

1206
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,428
TWICE.

1207
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,513
I REALLY DO THINK THAT IN THE

1208
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,309
LONG RUN JENNY WOULD BE BETTER

1209
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:17,938
FOR US PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY,

1210
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:18,105
SO...

1211
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,190
>> GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE,

1212
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:19,815
PLEASE.

1213
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,567
I'M NOT PERFECT, SCOTT.

1214
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,568
YOU KNOW WHAT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

1215
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:29,617
OKAY.

1216
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,535
PLEASE TRUST THE ORIGINAL

1217
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:31,911
ALLIANCE WE HAD.

1218
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,080
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

1219
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,456
I THINK THE FOUR OF US CAN GO

1220
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,458
FAR, RIDICULOUSLY FAR.

1221
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:43,422
SO PLEASE BELIEVE ME.

1222
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,466
>> Jeff: I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE

1223
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,717
EVER SEEN A TRIBAL COUNCIL LIKE

1224
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,927
THIS.

1225
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,638
>> THAT'S HOW BRAWN DOES IT.

1226
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,222
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1227
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,598
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1228
00:39:52,681 --> 00:40:09,990
ALECIA, YOU'RE UP.

1229
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,709
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1230
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:25,005
VOTES.

1231
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,636
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1232
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,138
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1233
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,933
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1234
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:36,267
OKAY.

1235
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:36,851
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1236
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,352
DECISION IS FINAL.

1237
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,478
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1238
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,230
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1239
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:41,981
IMMEDIATELY.

1240
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,524
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1241
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,529
FIRST VOTE, JENNY.

1242
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,657
ALECIA.

1243
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,324
ALECIA.

1244
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,535
TWO VOTES ALECIA.

1245
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,995
JENNY.

1246
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,413
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES ALECIA,

1247
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:03,252
TWO VOTES JENNY, ONE VOTE LEFT.

1248
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,004
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1249
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:09,633
BRAINS VERSUS BRAWN VERSUS

1250
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,467
BEAUTY, JENNY.

1251
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:24,440
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1252
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:28,360
GENERALLY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1253
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,613
>> HEY, GUYS, HOPE YOU WIN LOTS

1254
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:39,622
MORE CHALLENGES.

1255
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,790
>> Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S

1256
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,334
TRIBAL COUNCIL IS A DRAMATIC

1257
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,585
EXAMPLE OF HOW QUICKLY THE GAME

1258
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:44,877
CAN CHANGE.

1259
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,129
ONE WRONG WORD AND IT GOES FROM

1260
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,506
GOOD TO BAD, WHICH MEANS IT CAN

1261
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,926
ALSO GO FROM BAD TO GOOD.

1262
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,886
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1263
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,847
CAMP, GOOD NIGHT.

1264
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,741
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1265
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,283
"SURVIVOR," DEBBIE ENLIST A

1266
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:16,867
SOLDIER AND PLANS AN ATTACK.

1267
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,409
>> WE NEED TO MOVE WITH A

1268
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,035
PURPOSE, JOE, AND WE NEED TO DO

1269
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:18,285
IT NOW.

1270
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,496
>> Jeff: WHILE AT THE BRAWN

1271
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:20,746
TRIBE...

1272
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,289
>> IDOL TIME, BABY.

1273
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,708
>> Jeff: IT'S ALL-OUT WAR FOR

1274
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,125
THE IDOL.

1275
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,044
>> I TOOK OFF LIKE A BAT OUT OF

1276
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:27,253
HELL.

1277
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:27,836
YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO KEEP UP

1278
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,758
OR GET LEFT BEHIND.

1279
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,218
>> I AM SHOCKED.

1280
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,178
I THOUGHT THE TRIBE WOULD WANT

1281
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:36,845
TO STAY STRONG.

1282
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,639
WE CAN WORK OUT OUR PERSONAL

1283
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,473
FEELINGS LATER.

1284
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,225
AS FAR AS BEING VOTED OUT OF THE

1285
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:41,892
GAME, IT HURTS.

1286
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,477
THIS ISN'T WHAT I ENVISIONED.

1287
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,144
THIS ISN'T WHAT I CAME OUT HERE

1288
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,522
TO DO, BUT I PUSHED MYSELF AND

1289
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,274
DONE THINGS I NEVER EXPERIENCED

1290
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,067
BEFORE, SO I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

1291
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,069
REGRETS.
