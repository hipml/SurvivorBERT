00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,210
Previously on <i>Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,080
<i>This Rome guy's
playing really aggressive.</i>

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,020
No. It's <i>Survivor.</i> I don't have to.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,720
<i>Really hard.</i>

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,126
That's not a threat. That's an ultimatum.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,150
<i>And you best believe Rome's causing</i>

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,180
a whole lot of ruckus.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,980
<i>We can agree
to play these amulets together,</i>

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,280
<i>and they would have the effect</i>

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,580
of a hidden immunity idol.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,720
<i>Sierra really wants to keep Anika around.</i>

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,320
I feel like a piece of crap.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,780
<i>I really want to keep Andy around.</i>

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,080
<i>So, we have to figure out what the heck</i>

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,350
we're gonna do.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,320
Fifth person voted out of <i>Survivor</i> 47:

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,450
Anika.

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,120
Who-who owned this?

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,480
- It was the three of us.
- Three votes.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,080
The tribe has spoken.

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,180
<i>Look,</i>

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,020
<i>Tribal Council sucks.</i>

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
Not.

24
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,180
That was fun as hell.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,520
That was blindside city.

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,680
<i>Anika wanted me out since day two.</i>

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,680
<i>I wanted her out at the same time.</i>

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,626
<i>It was really exciting
because it just felt like</i>

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,420
<i>this big plan that really came together</i>

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,450
<i>exactly how I wanted it to go,</i>

31
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,180
<i>which is a new feeling for me out here.</i>

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,180
<i>I have flipped the script.</i>

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
<i>Rachel was feeling</i>

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,150
so confident,

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,880
<i>and now, ostensibly,
Rachel is on the bottom.</i>

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
I first want to apologize that
you were left out of the vote

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,620
because I genuinely

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,150
feel connected to Ani,
and I know you do, too.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
So, it's like, I don't want you to be

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,086
- upset with us.
- Yeah, I mean, obviously

41
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,256
I'm not mad, guys.
We're playing <i>Survivor.</i>

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,626
- Like, I get it.
- Well, I mean...

43
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,256
But I'm confused - Well, I

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,796
- why I was left out.
- Wait, wait, wait. I know. One-one

45
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,256
- I mean...
- I'm sorry for leaving you

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,856
- out of the vote, as well.
- I'm so sorry.

47
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,426
- That's not what we wanted to do.
- Because I

48
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,996
really, really, really want
to play the game with you.

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,180
- Yeah, so...
- Just for my part, like, I feel like

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,756
Anika was sort of a wedge between us.

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,280
I knew she wanted me out.

52
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,256
Yeah. I mean, she did
want you out from the start.

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Yeah.

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,450
And I'm sorry for
putting your name down, Andy.

55
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,920
I thought that that was
the consensus vote, and I'm

56
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,950
I'm just trying to be
with the numbers and be safe,

57
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,450
and that's not a good excuse.

58
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,750
- And we can talk about it, but...
- We can talk, yeah.

59
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,420
<i>I was absolutely taken aback
by tonight's vote.</i>

60
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,280
<i>It felt like a big betrayal,
and it's not a good reality</i>

61
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,150
to be at the bottom of the tribe,

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,626
<i>especially when you consider, like...</i>

63
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,080
<i>Wow, I really thought.</i>

64
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,380
<i>Andy was at the bottom
of the tribe for the last week,</i>

65
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
and somehow I am the person
at the bottom of the tribe.

66
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,880
- This went about as good as it could have gone.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,950
It was clean, we didn't

68
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,550
break out the idol, so

69
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,050
<i>I chose</i>

70
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,150
not to play my hidden immunity idol.

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,820
<i>Tonight was the last
Tribal Council it was good for,</i>

72
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,780
<i>and I didn't play it tonight
because Andy doesn't know</i>

73
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,110
I have said idol,

74
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,650
<i>and I didn't want to lose trust.</i>

75
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,050
<i>So, I chose to see</i>

76
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,420
<i>if I can use it further down the road</i>

77
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,780
as a decoy or a fake

78
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,180
or something to just have some fun with.

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,780
Man, this game.

80
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,680
As soon as you think you have
a grasp of what's going on,

81
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,110
- it just flips you on your head.
- It just changes.

82
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
But tomorrow, maybe.

83
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,580
I know.

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,796
- Yeah.
- But it's, like, we can just start from zero.

85
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,950
Things change on a dime.

86
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,620
<i>I've hit my rock-bottom game
at this point.</i>

87
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,110
<i>I need other pathways.</i>

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
And so, I want more than anything

89
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,680
for merge to come, like, immediately.

90
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,010
I'm hoping for, like, a lifeline.

91
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,980
A boat?

92
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,280
Yeah.

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,780
- Yeah.
- He's coming?

94
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,750
- Yeah, he's coming.
- My God. - God.

95
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,350
Thank you.

96
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,126
- It's not a journey.
- It's not a journey.

97
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,820
Not a journey. Not a journey.

98
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,580
Please.

99
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,550
Yes!

100
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,420
<i>The angels were singing
to me this morning</i>

101
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,420
<i>after the disaster that was last night.</i>

102
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,850
<i>Now I get</i>

103
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,420
an entire beach
of new people waiting to help me

104
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,010
<i>further myself in this game. Like, it is</i>

105
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,080
the lifeline that I desperately need.

106
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,350
- Drop 'em.
- Drop 'em.!

107
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,380
<i>And now I hope
that I can take the lessons</i>

108
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,280
<i>of being blindsided
and use that as rocket fuel</i>

109
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,650
to get myself into this merge.

110
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,550
No.

111
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,780
"Drop your Buffs!"

112
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,280
My God!

113
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,880
Yeah!

114
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,010
- My God.
- My God.

115
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,320
- Baby.
- My God! Wow.

116
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,380
<i>Every</i> Survivor <i>player
wants to live to see the day</i>

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,580
that it says, "Drop your Buffs."

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,450
And for me in particular,
this just feels like

119
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,780
<i>a new lease on life
because I was so nervous</i>

120
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,256
<i>about my life in this game.</i>

121
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,110
<i>But at the same time,
I'm Buffless right now.</i>

122
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,110
<i>I don't have a home. I don't know</i>

123
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,880
if I'm going to have a home.

124
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,256
But I'm certainly very excited
to go and find one.

125
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,010
Hey! Hey! Hey!

126
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,320
Let's go, man. Let's get it.

127
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,280
My God!

128
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,050
My God!

129
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,620
- What the heck?!
- Come on.

130
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,050
<i>I was somebody</i>

131
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,050
who wanted to etch my legacy in stone.

132
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,880
I want to put my head on

133
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,620
<i>the new-era Mount Rushmore
of</i> Survivor.

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,420
<i>And to do that,
you got to make the merge.</i>

135
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,650
<i>We're not quite
at the merge yet, but pre-merge,</i>

136
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,480
in <i>Survivor,</i>
it's <i>Survivor</i> elementary school.

137
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,620
<i>And the actual merge
is</i> Survivor <i>high school.</i>

138
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,780
<i>That's where the big dogs come out, and</i>

139
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,780
I'm ready to graduate.

140
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,420
They're coming here?

141
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,256
- They're coming here.
- They're coming here. - What?!

142
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,150
<i>When I heard that they were all
coming over, I'm like, "Shoot.</i>

143
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,050
They're gonna look through our bags."

144
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,720
So that got me very paranoid

145
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,580
<i>because I knew I needed to clean my idol</i>

146
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,320
<i>because it's covered in freakin' red paint.</i>

147
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,950
<i>The idol, when it came crashing down,</i>

148
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,350
it was in a jar

149
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,950
<i>of red paint.</i>

150
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,780
<i>It took me so long to clean up
the mess to begin with.</i>

151
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
<i>I just took</i>

152
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,256
the idol and put it back

153
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,620
<i>in the paint-filled tube.</i>

154
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,580
<i>But while I was scurrying at the water</i>

155
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,420
<i>while trying to rinse off any evidence of</i>

156
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,780
my... crime,

157
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,110
<i>I hear a boat.</i>

158
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,680
Shoot.

159
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,550
Yeah!

160
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,380
We made it!

161
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Yeah!

162
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,010
<i>There is not enough words</i>

163
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,420
<i>to explain how excited I am.</i>

164
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,726
We're finally getting a chance to be

165
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,756
in the same vicinity as one another.

166
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,880
<i>It's amazing.</i>

167
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,480
It's wonderful to finally meet.

168
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,180
<i>And as I'm walking up the beach.</i>

169
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,080
I see a sign.

170
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,256
Excuse me.

171
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,380
We have to read this!

172
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,010
My God.

173
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,280
"Read with all tribe mates together."

174
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,420
My God. What is it, Jeff?

175
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,880
Wow. Right now?

176
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,080
What?

177
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,550
What?

178
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,380
This is nuts.

179
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,110
<i>We all kind of take off, but there's just</i>

180
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,650
endless forest. This place is massive.

181
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,580
<i>It's impossible to search every tree,</i>

182
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,110
<i>every crack in the ocean.</i>

183
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,880
<i>Like, this is a needle in a haystack.</i>

184
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,450
Look behind me.
There's 50 trees behind me

185
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,050
in just what you can see.

186
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,450
No, I-I was hoping you guys did.

187
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,950
I'm like, "Somebody needs
to have found it by now."

188
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,110
<i>I ended up losing my vote
on the journey, and.</i>

189
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,710
No-Vote Kyle feels a little
uncomfortable in the world, so,

190
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,450
<i>of course an advantage
would be nice for me.</i>

191
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,520
<i>I want this advantage</i>

192
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,680
very badly, but unfortunately,

193
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,150
<i>the clue says "somewhere,"
and I have no internal compass,</i>

194
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,480
so...

195
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,380
This is nice.
This should be a swimming spot.

196
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,350
- This water...
- What is the...

197
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,350
- This water...
- What is the buoy?

198
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,480
I have no idea.

199
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,110
I think I've seen a couple
of those floating around.

200
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,610
You are.

201
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,050
- Yeah. Yes.
- Right.

202
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,986
Of course it's so important
to have an advantage

203
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,396
in that pivotal, pivotal challenge.

204
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,910
<i>But you know what
we want to do right now?</i>

205
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,090
We want to meet each other.

206
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,826
<i>We want to get to know each other.</i>

207
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,256
We don't want to go run around and, like,

208
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,810
sow paranoia right now.

209
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,750
So I've done <i>Willy Wonka.</i>

210
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,086
Which... Who were you? I did that, too.

211
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,180
- Mike Teavee.
- Me too!

212
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,320
Hey!

213
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,010
What, are you crazy?

214
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,550
- I'm 45, so...
- Right. I'm 42.

215
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,050
- We have to...
- You're 45, I'm 42.

216
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,426
- We look good for 45 and 42.
- Yeah, we do.

217
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,850
- We do.
- Right?

218
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,810
<i>I don't want to put a target on my back</i>

219
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,480
<i>looking for this advantage, but</i>

220
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,910
I want to look for that damn thing so bad.

221
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,910
Who isn't?

222
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,910
Like, what are we doing? We're chilling

223
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,450
<i>at the camp right now?</i>

224
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,080
<i>There's an advantage out there.</i>

225
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,256
<i>What the hell, guys?</i>

226
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,680
I get it. Time to build bonds,

227
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,980
<i>but it's, like,</i>

228
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,110
we got work to do.

229
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,080
We have to find it.

230
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,710
- We have to find it.
- Right?

231
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,320
I mean, that would be...

232
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,320
There's, like, red paint up here, too.

233
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,740
Has anybody looked over here yet?

234
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,610
What the hell is up with this paint?

235
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,980
Yeah, there's a lot of red.

236
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,580
Right here, too. Look.

237
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,950
<i>We're at the water well.</i>

238
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,256
Red, splattered paint everywhere.

239
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,396
It looks like a murder scene out here.

240
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,850
It's all over this area, though.

241
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,580
Whoa.

242
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,550
<i>And then there's some, like,</i>

243
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,650
pottery pieces
that are saturated red paint.

244
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,710
Here's another one.

245
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,910
What the heck?

246
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,650
That's interesting.

247
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,750
It starts feeling like a murder mystery.

248
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,680
- Gotcha.
- Yeah, gotcha. Thank you.

249
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,280
<i>And then, Rome digs a little bit</i>

250
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,380
and sees a huge

251
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,680
<i>pot with a bunch of red paint.</i>

252
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,910
That's shattered pottery.

253
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,170
With a bunch of red in there.

254
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,280
What the heck?

255
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,350
<i>When I see that red paint,</i>

256
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,480
my mind flashes to Sue
at their water well.

257
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,850
Did you fall?

258
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,180
I was playing with the machete.
I'm good. I just...

259
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,320
It's okay.

260
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,257
<i>And I think.</i>

261
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:18,650
Sue found the idol!

262
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,280
<i>Sue is playing this game.</i>

263
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,320
<i>I am proud of Sue,
and I'm gonna keep her secret</i>

264
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,610
no matter what.

265
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,850
Hi. You missed out on a fiasco.

266
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,050
There's a weird,

267
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,080
- like, red paint thing going on.
- What?

268
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,510
<i>When I heard that</i>

269
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,280
<i>everyone found
this mysterious red paint,</i>

270
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,410
my heart sunk.

271
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,510
No way.

272
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,880
<i>Now I know I am busted.</i>

273
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,010
<i>I feel like a criminal</i>

274
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,610
that they found a little piece of evidence,

275
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,580
<i>and now the cops are coming
and I can hear the sirens</i>

276
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,950
coming closer to me.

277
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,256
It looks like a crime scene.

278
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,826
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
- It really does.

279
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,910
<i>And I had this panic inside.</i>

280
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,880
<i>But the smartest thing to do
is just keep my mouth shut</i>

281
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,150
right now and see how it plays out.

282
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,510
<i>Everyone's chilling, but I just can't let go</i>

283
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,126
<i>of this advantage concept, and I've got</i>

284
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,790
one place in my mind
that I want to check.

285
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,910
I can't stop thinking
about this stupid buoy.

286
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,586
<i>It's like this little bee in my bonnet</i>

287
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,110
<i>of, like, why is that out there?</i>

288
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,550
<i>It's probably nothing.</i>

289
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,026
All of the Tukus would have checked this

290
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,410
if it was something.

291
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,910
<i>But it stands out to me as something.</i>

292
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,110
I'm going in the water.

293
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,150
I hate it. This is not gonna be it

294
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,650
and I'm gonna get eaten
by a shark just 'cause

295
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,410
it's bothering me in my head.

296
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,010
<i>I get out there, and even
as I'm one foot away, I'm like,</i>

297
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,480
<i>"This is just a random buoy."</i>

298
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,180
But as I'm, like, one inch away.

299
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,180
I see something is attached to it.

300
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,810
<i>I'm like, "This can't be real."</i>

301
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,150
<i>My God. I never find</i>

302
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
anything.

303
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,910
<i>And now, I finally found something.</i>

304
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,550
- Guys?
- Yay!

305
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,050
You found it?

306
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,610
- It was the buoy?!
- Yes.

307
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,050
Genevieve, it was the buoy?!

308
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,450
It was the buoy, Sam.

309
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,080
No way.

310
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,480
<i>Sam was kicking himself,</i>

311
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,956
<i>'cause he's like,
"Yeah, we saw that buoy.</i>

312
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,750
<i>We said it was nothing."</i>

313
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,910
Should have gone for a swim, Sam.

314
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,710
Boo.

315
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,256
So, what was the deal with the red paint?

316
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,880
- I have no idea.
- We don't know.

317
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,686
So now we know the paint
is something different.

318
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,110
- Someone's got something else.
- Boy.

319
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,580
- Let the games begin.
- Yeah.

320
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,710
<i>A few days ago,</i>

321
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,150
Caroline and I found Sue
covered in red stuff.

322
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,110
<i>And immediately, my red flag</i>

323
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,256
was raised, because I was
kind of confused as to what

324
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,080
<i>she could have possibly done. But now</i>

325
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,280
it's kind of starting to make sense to me.

326
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,580
<i>Caroline figured it out.
I trust Caroline the most.</i>

327
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,110
<i>I feel that she'll keep my secret.</i>

328
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,110
<i>But the problem is I feel.</i>

329
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,180
<i>Tiyana knows, and</i>

330
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,550
I see how she can flip-flop.

331
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,450
So she's always gonna be
that middle person

332
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,380
that I'm not gonna always trust.

333
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,810
<i>And if I have to chop the head
of the snake off</i>

334
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,880
<i>I will, to protect myself.</i>

335
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,880
- I wouldn't get rid of him.
- Okay.

336
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,480
Wow. You see that rainbow? Yeah.

337
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,780
Where?

338
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,450
- It's so random.
- Rainbow.

339
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,050
Good.

340
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,050
<i>What I'm trying
to do right now in this game</i>

341
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,680
<i>is try and get as much
information as possible</i>

342
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,110
<i>because information is key.</i>

343
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,450
And so, if you're able to trust someone

344
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,450
with some information,

345
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,256
<i>that's massive in this game.</i>

346
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,380
<i>So last night, Kyle... me and him</i>

347
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,010
<i>while we're sitting there talking,</i>

348
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,050
<i>he'd let way too many names
fly out of his mouth.</i>

349
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
<i>He's sitting here saying
that Sam is the person</i>

350
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,450
that he feels like
could win this game easily.

351
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,756
<i>Then I asked him,
"Okay, if that's how you feel</i>

352
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,910
<i>about one of the guys"</i>

353
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,526
"which lady
are you most threatened by?"

354
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,910
And he said, "Tiyana."

355
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,810
<i>He also told me with Caroline and Sue,</i>

356
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,510
they're not really good at challenges,

357
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,550
and they're not really doing
that well socially, either, so,

358
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,880
<i>he's essentially writing them off already.</i>

359
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,880
<i>So what do I do with that information?</i>

360
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,110
That's not true.

361
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,280
<i>The more information
that I have like that,</i>

362
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,010
<i>the more I can warn the people that are</i>

363
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,110
the targets of someone that,

364
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,910
"Hey, people are coming for you."

365
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,610
I'm not surprised that he's bashing me.

366
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,610
I mean, he wrote my name down.

367
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,980
<i>And if people feel like</i>

368
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,626
<i>I'm the one
bringing them that information,</i>

369
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,256
then I'm the one that they're
gonna want to keep around.

370
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,256
- Thank you for letting me know.
- Yeah.

371
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,410
<i>After hearing that Kyle's still chirping</i>

372
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,850
<i>about me and Caroline,</i>

373
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,580
<i>my daggers are out again.</i>

374
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,010
I want Kyle to be the first target.

375
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,380
I was talking with Kyle,

376
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,800
and pretty much he was telling me

377
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,450
the scarier thing
in the game right now is Sam.

378
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,780
- Really?
- Like, to him specifically. Yeah.

379
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,580
I asked him, "Okay, well, for the ladies",

380
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,650
who's the most threatening?"
And he said you.

381
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,010
What the ..., dude?

382
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm just letting you know.

383
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,950
<i>My mind immediately
goes racing because</i>

384
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,510
Kyle is one of my closest allies.

385
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,256
Like, it wouldn't make any sense

386
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,256
for him to start throwing out my name.

387
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,110
That makes no sense to me.

388
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,150
<i>I said it a million times.</i>

389
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,580
<i>I'm gonna play with my gut.</i>

390
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,610
<i>And once he told me that, my gut feeling</i>

391
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,050
it wasn't a, "my gosh,
I'm nervous, and I am paranoid."

392
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,010
It was a, "That doesn't feel right."

393
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,580
Rome told me that
Kyle threw my name out there

394
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,980
- last night at the beach.
- Last night? That's wild.

395
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,056
Just so you guys both know,
this is what Rome does.

396
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,950
He, like...

397
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,350
Really?

398
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,956
- You think he would make that up to us?
- Yes.

399
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,350
- This is how he plays his game.
- It's good to know.

400
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,550
<i>The thing about Rome is,
Rome just talks, talks, talks,</i>

401
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,010
<i>and it's crap, crap, crap.</i>

402
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,480
<i>So I needed</i>

403
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,680
to make sure, like, "Hey,
whenever you're talking to Rome,

404
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,350
you got to fact-check this stuff."

405
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,910
True.

406
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,810
So, Rome told Tiyana that you said

407
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,880
she's the biggest threat in this game.

408
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
- My God. Really?
- Yeah.

409
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,710
Did you say anything? I mean, I'm not...

410
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,980
No. He told me that he thinks
Tiyana's the most dangerous girl

411
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,250
because she's able
to mingle with everybody.

412
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,280
<i>Rome doesn't know how
to keep his mouth shut.</i>

413
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,050
<i>And he twisted up a bunch
of words that I told him early</i>

414
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,880
this morning because I was trying

415
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,426
to have general conversation with him.

416
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,480
Damn, man. What a dick.

417
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,210
<i>I am fired up, buddy.</i>

418
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,450
I am feeling froggy as it gets at this point.

419
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,810
- You don't?
- No.

420
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,050
<i>I'm still No-vote Kyle.</i>

421
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,150
I'm a sitting duck.

422
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,050
- I'm gonna crush him.
- Yeah.

423
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,956
<i>So, at this point in time,
all I have is my social skills.</i>

424
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,210
<i>I'm fixing</i>

425
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,150
to squish him like a bug.

426
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,130
I'm just gonna throw it
out there for everybody.

427
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,850
Seriously.

428
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,910
I thought-I thought
I had a connection, and now.

429
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,580
- Wow.
- I find out that he's, like,

430
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
making it sound like I threw at you.

431
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,650
And I'm just like,

432
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,510
- "... that."
- Yeah, like,

433
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,256
- I'm chopping it immediately.
- Can I say something, Kyle?

434
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,010
He also, this morning
at the beach, told me

435
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,810
that you were bashing Caroline and I.

436
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,626
No. And see,
I didn't bash either one of you.

437
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,180
What I said was, you have, like,
a mother-daughter relationship.

438
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,380
Everybody knows I'm one of
the most honest dumb asses here.

439
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,780
- I believe you.
- Rome is now my number one hit.

440
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
<i>I ain't never working with Rome.</i>

441
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,310
He buried himself.

442
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,380
Like, the first opportunity
I get, Rome's outie.

443
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,280
Come on in!

444
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,850
Look at this. First time getting to see

445
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,780
everybody together.

446
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,410
We are in the individual portion
of this game.

447
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,350
All right, shall we get to it?

448
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,110
Yes. Let's go.

449
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,750
All right, well, typically,

450
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,150
this is the part of the game

451
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,180
where you compete
in a physically demanding,

452
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,610
emotionally challenging course
to determine

453
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,380
who will earn the merge meal,

454
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,780
who will earn the merge,

455
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,150
who will get their Buff,

456
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,410
who will be safe tonight at Tribal Council,

457
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,650
who will be vulnerable tonight
at Tribal Council.

458
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,810
Good news is we're still gonna do that.

459
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,550
But with a twist.

460
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,880
Here's how it works.

461
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,580
We're still gonna divide
into two teams of six.

462
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,480
The winning team will earn a meal,

463
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,256
but it is not a merge meal

464
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,450
because winning the first team challenge

465
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,950
does not earn you a spot in the merge.

466
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,550
For that, you will have
to work even harder.

467
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,050
The winning six will then
move on to a second challenge,

468
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,080
where you will compete
against each other.

469
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,980
- My gosh.
- For individual immunity,

470
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,980
and the winner of that challenge

471
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,050
will earn the individual
immunity necklace.

472
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,050
Wow.

473
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,910
Wow.

474
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,350
- I love it.
- That person

475
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,080
will be safe tonight at Tribal Council.

476
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,610
That person will make the merge.

477
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,810
That person will get their Buff.

478
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,650
That will be the only person...

479
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,256
- Holy.
- Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

480
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,110
Who is safe tonight at Tribal Council.

481
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,150
One will be safe.

482
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,710
- 12 will not.
- Wow.

483
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,780
- Wow.
- Wow.

484
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,180
All right, there is one more twist.

485
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,580
Yesterday, an advantage
was planted at your camp.

486
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,256
- How did that go?
- It went well for me.

487
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,150
Great. Bring it over to me.

488
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,610
Good job, Genevieve.

489
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

490
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,910
All right. So,
this advantage is a good one.

491
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,850
Tell you how it works.

492
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,980
Genevieve, you do not have to participate

493
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,310
- in this arduous team challenge.
- Yes.

494
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,150
Instead, you move directly to
the second individual challenge,

495
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,510
where you will have a one in seven shot

496
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,750
at winning this necklace.

497
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,680
You have also earned the food reward.

498
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,880
Thank you.

499
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,080
All right, let me walk you
through today's challenge.

500
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,486
<i>For today's challenge, you're gonna race</i>

501
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,350
<i>through mud and wood shavings</i>

502
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,850
<i>until you reach a cage.</i>

503
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,750
<i>You'll then use a grappling hook
to retrieve a large bag</i>

504
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,256
<i>containing a ball.</i>

505
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,610
<i>You'll then work together to get</i>

506
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,380
<i>to the top of a very steep ramp
to the platform,</i>

507
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,810
<i>where two players will use that ball</i>

508
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,280
<i>and attempt to maneuver it
through a table maze.</i>

509
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,550
The first team of six
to win earns the food

510
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,980
and the right to move on
to the next challenge.

511
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,780
The losing six... got nothing for you.

512
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,410
- Make sense?
- Yes, sir.

513
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,150
All right, we're gonna divide into teams.

514
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,450
Think we need to do something
different here, as well.

515
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,780
We've never done a schoolyard pick

516
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,256
in the new era,

517
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,310
so we're gonna do
a random draw for captains.

518
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,150
- Wow. - Boy.
- Here we go.

519
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,650
Biggest challenge of the season.
Come on, now.

520
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,550
All right, we have our two teams.

521
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,310
For Yellow, it is Sierra,

522
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,080
Rachel, Sam, Sue,

523
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,950
Kyle and Teeny.

524
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,080
For Blue, we have

525
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,080
Rome, Caroline,

526
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,280
Andy, Gabe,

527
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,910
Tiyana and Sol.

528
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,850
Genevieve with a nice, comfortable

529
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,850
spot to watch.

530
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,180
This is the first stage
of a two-stage challenge.

531
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,850
The winners of this group earn the food

532
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,710
and the right to move on
to the second stage,

533
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,350
where you will compete
for individual immunity.

534
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,180
Losers of this walk away empty-handed.

535
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,550
Here we go. Survivors ready?

536
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,910
Go! Start in pairs.
It's gonna be Sam and Kyle,

537
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,610
Andy and Tiyana.

538
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,780
You got to get through that mud
to your mat.

539
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,350
That is a low crawl.

540
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,950
You got to work on your belly
to get through and under.

541
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,950
It is tight.

542
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,150
Here goes Kyle. He's good.

543
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,510
Here comes Sam.

544
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,850
Go, Yellow!

545
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,880
Gonna be Sierra and Rachel
now in the mud.

546
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,356
Blue still working to get to the mat.

547
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,280
Andy taking a long time.

548
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,650
Go, Blue!

549
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,010
There's Sol and Rome in the mud

550
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,480
for Blue.

551
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,350
- Come on.
- You got to get to that mat.

552
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,680
You're good, Yellow!

553
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,010
Rome now taking a long time to get out.

554
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,110
You're good, Blue!

555
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,180
Let's go.

556
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,050
It is Sue and Teeny for Yellow,

557
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,850
Caroline and Gabe for Blue.

558
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,350
Come on, Gabe.

559
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,710
Once you get to that mat,
you go individually.

560
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,580
Here comes Sue. Here comes Caroline.

561
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,750
You're good, Blue, good, Yellow!

562
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,710
You go over
and then through the wood chips.

563
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,256
You got this, Sol.

564
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,680
Thataway, Kyle.

565
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,956
Kyle getting through that quickly.

566
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,480
There goes Sol for Blue.

567
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,810
- Get to the mat.
- Go, Kyle.

568
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,010
Go, Yellow!

569
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,480
Here comes Sam for Yellow.
Sol's got to get to that mat.

570
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,850
You're good. Go, Blue!

571
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,080
Here goes Andy.

572
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,680
Sam whipping through this.

573
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,180
Go, Yellow!

574
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,580
Andy working for Blue.

575
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,310
- Go, Blue!
- Yeah, Sierra!

576
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,050
Sierra moving through
that first obstacle quickly.

577
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,050
You're good, Yellow!

578
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,080
Here comes Tiyana for Blue.

579
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Teeny working quickly.
You're good, Yellow.

580
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,310
It's gonna be Sue,
the last person for Yellow,

581
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,780
- Rome for Blue.
- There you go.

582
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,110
Sue's got to get to the mat.

583
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,450
You're good, Yellow! Move on!

584
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,780
Come on. Come on, Rome.

585
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,886
You're good, Blue. Move on.

586
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,080
At this stage of the challenge,

587
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,410
now you're removing jungle debris

588
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,256
to reveal a big bag

589
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,580
containing a ball.

590
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,110
And the two people up top
are using a grappling hook

591
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,510
to retrieve it.

592
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,710
Good job, you guys!

593
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,010
Yellow has their grappling hook
on the bag.

594
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,380
Now they got to get it up.

595
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,050
You're ready. You're ready. Go, go, go.

596
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,610
Help, help.

597
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,086
Blue has their grappling hook on the bag.

598
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,256
Now they got to get it up.

599
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,880
Grab the bag! Don't drop it!

600
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,610
You got to get it up and over.

601
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,080
Y'all got it.

602
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,526
- Sol holding it.
- One, two, three.

603
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,280
- Rome trying to pull it.
- One more!

604
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,410
- Heave!
- Sam bear-hugging it now,

605
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,080
trying to do it himself.

606
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,410
And he's done it!

607
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,950
You're good, Yellow! Go!

608
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,256
Good job!

609
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,680
Blue has it! You're good! Go!

610
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,750
Got to get everybody down
into your mats.

611
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,380
Slide. You need that bag.

612
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,710
Now you got to get all six players

613
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,410
and your bag to the next mat.

614
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,050
Yellow working together.

615
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,710
- Blue working together.
- Let's go.

616
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,550
You're good. Start untying.

617
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,380
Now you got to release that ball

618
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,686
- from the bag.
- It's open, it's open, it's open.

619
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,826
Wait, I see it, I see it, I see it.

620
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,180
Yellow has the ball.

621
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,410
Blue has their ball.

622
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,080
You're good. Go!

623
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,110
Yellow gonna take on the ramp.

624
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,180
Blue now gonna take on the ramp.

625
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,120
If you weren't tired already, this will do it.

626
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,310
Gabe not messing around.

627
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,010
Immediately gets up,

628
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,880
grabs the rope,
and he can now help people up.

629
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,180
Here goes Rome.

630
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,150
He's got the rope. There goes Kyle.

631
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,950
- There goes Tiyana for Blue.
- Help her!

632
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,050
Kyle gets up now for Yellow.

633
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,150
Teeny gives it a go.
It's not gonna happen.

634
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,150
That is a very steep ramp.

635
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,610
Tiyana falls back down.

636
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,110
Another attempt by Sierra.

637
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,780
You've got sandbags if you need 'em.

638
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,510
Sol is up for Blue.

639
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,650
Most difficult part
of this challenge is getting up

640
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,310
to the table maze.! So close, Sue!

641
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,780
Sue with another huge effort.

642
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,310
- Not a bad idea.
- Yellow now gonna go get their sandbags.

643
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,410
You can build a ladder
to help you get up higher,

644
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,750
but it takes a lot of energy
to drag those bags over.

645
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,250
There goes Tiyana.

646
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,150
She's got the rope!

647
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,180
Can she hang on?

648
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,980
Andy grabbing Tiyana's arm.

649
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,110
Sierra's up for Yellow.

650
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,490
Can you pull her all the way up?

651
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,410
Tiyana is up for Blue, and we're down

652
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,010
to one person left.

653
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,150
Here goes Caroline.

654
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,450
Close.

655
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,010
Yellow stacking sandbags

656
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,580
strategically.

657
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,910
You get that high enough,

658
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,980
you just reach up and grab that rope.

659
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,510
Gabe coming down.
Gonna give Caroline a hand.

660
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,410
Andy being held by Sol and Rome.

661
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,550
You got this! All you got!

662
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,850
There goes Caroline again.

663
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,180
And she's got it. Andy has her.

664
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,950
Andy is being held by everybody else.

665
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,650
This is a test

666
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,650
of trust right now.

667
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,080
Caroline is there.

668
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,610
Now it's up to Gabe.
He's already been up there once.

669
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,010
Gonna have to pull himself up again.

670
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,750
Blue now looking very good.

671
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,970
They can move on to the
table maze. Two tribe members.

672
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,350
Yellow's still working to get up.

673
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,410
- They are building a wall of sandbags.
- Pick it up?

674
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,580
- You-you... you let go.
- It's got to go this way.

675
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,480
Gabe and Rome
for Blue on the table maze.

676
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,610
Sue is up for Yellow!

677
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,910
Yellow's got some momentum now.
Here comes Teeny.

678
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,910
That strategy of sandbags is working.

679
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,910
Tiny bit from you.

680
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,880
Yeah. You, you, you, you.

681
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,490
Rachel's up and over now for Yellow.

682
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,080
Here comes Kyle.
This should be easy for Kyle.

683
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,310
He did it once.

684
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,480
Everybody's up for Yellow. You're in this.

685
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,450
It's gonna be Sam and Kyle
on the maze for Yellow.

686
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,110
It's Gabe and Rome for Blue.

687
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,780
Okay, not too hard, not too hard.

688
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,850
Slowly and touch.

689
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,810
Now it's gonna be all about touch

690
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,480
and working together.

691
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,950
Two people is
much more difficult than one.

692
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,256
One, you just worry about yourself.

693
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,050
Two, you got to worry about that
other idiot you're playing with.

694
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,156
- Guys!
- That was me. We're good, we're good, we're good.

695
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,950
You got to be subtle.

696
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,110
Tiny movements around those obstacles.

697
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,510
Okay. Chill, chill, chill.

698
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,380
- Blue is all over the place.
- Come on, guys, take your time.

699
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,310
Moving with crazy, jerky moves.

700
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,280
Rome, you're being... touch
is way too much right now.

701
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,480
Sol, Sol, we're good, brother.
I appreciate it, man.

702
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,986
- All right.
- We're good. We got this. Don't worry.

703
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,350
Sam and Kyle very steady.

704
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,580
They have not changed their
approach the entire challenge.

705
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,780
Blue making huge moves, - Guys.

706
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,010
Playing much more carefree.

707
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,110
Blue drops, and they're back to the start.

708
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,380
It is now Yellow in the lead.

709
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,126
You need to pick up on your side a little.

710
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,680
Gabe and Rome drop.
They've got to start again.

711
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,880
- Is there a swap-outs?
- No.

712
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,780
- Bro, relax, relax.
- All right. My bad.

713
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,180
Yellow, slow and steady,

714
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,850
getting closer to the center.

715
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,880
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- There goes Blue again.

716
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,950
Aggressive out of the gate.
They've got a pattern.

717
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,010
They are quickly catching Yellow.

718
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,380
Sam and Kyle making more progress.

719
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,750
Blue trying to catch them.

720
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,256
Blue very close to catching Yellow.

721
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,380
Too close to call right now.

722
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,750
So once it goes this way,

723
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,610
- I'm-I'm pulling down.
- While Yellow is

724
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,256
taking their time talking,
Blue is now catching.

725
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,910
Now Blue in the lead.

726
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,650
This is very close. Both balls
in nearly the same spot.

727
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,880
Go!

728
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,480
Yellow's in the inner circle.

729
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,180
Blue is close to the inner circle.

730
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,350
Blue drops.

731
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,850
Yellow wins! That's it!

732
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,710
- Yeah!
- Wow, what a finish.

733
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,980
Within inches

734
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,110
of each other.

735
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,310
Defeat for Caroline, Tiyana,

736
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,780
Gabe, Rome,

737
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,010
Andy and Sol.

738
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,710
No food, no shot at immunity.

739
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,710
What a huge effort in stage one.

740
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,610
Wow.

741
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,850
All right, you six,
you're now gonna move on

742
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,310
to the second challenge.

743
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,780
Head down with me. You six,

744
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,010
take a spot on the bench,
we'll get this going.

745
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,050
<i>This challenge was grueling,</i>

746
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,750
<i>and even though we won,</i>

747
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,380
<i>we have to continue, totally exhausted,</i>

748
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,710
<i>and compete for the first
individual immunity.</i>

749
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,850
<i>Survivor</i> is tough.

750
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,680
All right.

751
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,140
You all are eating this afternoon.

752
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,180
Food is gonna be waiting
for you back at camp.

753
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,810
But all you care about right now
is winning this.

754
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,256
This is the second part
of earn-the-merge.

755
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,810
You win this,

756
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,080
you win individual immunity,

757
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,256
you are safe tonight at Tribal Council,

758
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
you will get a Buff,

759
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,150
which means you will be the first person

760
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,610
- of <i>Survivor</i> 47 to earn the merge.
- Wow.

761
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,880
The stakes are never higher.

762
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,050
Who knows what's gonna
happen this afternoon

763
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,750
with 13 people in the game?

764
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,256
All right, here's how it works.

765
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,880
<i>For today's challenge,
you're gonna stand</i>

766
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,850
<i>on a very narrow beam</i>

767
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,550
<i>while balancing a ball on a wooden bow.</i>

768
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,580
<i>At regular intervals, you will
move farther down the beam,</i>

769
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,910
<i>making it more difficult.</i>

770
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,550
<i>If at any point you drop or your ball drops</i>

771
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,980
<i>you're out.</i>

772
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,010
Last person left standing wins

773
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,256
individual immunity and
everything that comes with it.

774
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,610
Losers, you will join the other six,

775
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,810
going to Tribal Council
tonight vulnerable.

776
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,750
All right, everybody take
your spots, and we'll get it on.

777
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,910
Here we go.

778
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,850
All right.

779
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,710
Everybody's in your first position.

780
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,150
Place your ball on your bow.

781
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,510
Ooh.

782
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,980
- My gosh.
- Come on, baby.

783
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,310
Wait till everybody's good and centered,

784
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,280
and then I'm gonna call it.

785
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,410
All right, everybody is looking good,

786
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,780
and this challenge is on.

787
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,280
We'll be in this first section
for five minutes.

788
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,780
Genevieve, as fresh as you can be,

789
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,780
given it's day 12 of <i>Survivor.</i>

790
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,010
She is not covered in mud,
is not exhausted.

791
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,480
- That is the big advantage Genevieve has.
- Come on.

792
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,710
Sierra drops.

793
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,910
We are down to six.

794
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,280
Sam with a nice save.
Can he get it back?

795
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,110
One end to another.

796
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,926
No, Sam is out.
You can leave the ball, Sam.

797
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,750
Take a spot on the bench.

798
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,280
We are down to five.

799
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,826
Now it's Rachel with a little movement,

800
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,950
and a nice recovery by Rachel.

801
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,150
You cannot lose your concentration.

802
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,080
Whatever it takes
to keep your mind occupied,

803
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,450
- that's what you got to be doing.
- Back to the center.

804
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,780
If you get comfortable,

805
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,380
and you start to drift, so will that ball,

806
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,410
and before you know it,

807
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,380
you're out, you're on the bench.

808
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,410
15 seconds left.

809
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,310
Survive this, you move to the next stage

810
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,880
of this challenge.

811
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,180
Get a little more difficult.

812
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,050
Five, four, three,

813
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,380
two, one.

814
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,986
You can grab your ball. Everybody's safe.

815
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,610
Well done.

816
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,256
You will now move down.
Don't get off the beam.

817
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,450
You're gonna move now
down into the next section.

818
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,310
- So hot.
- This is more narrow.

819
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,686
- Scalding.
- It's gonna be a little more difficult.

820
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,280
Ooh. All right.

821
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,980
Everybody, place your ball.

822
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,280
Everybody looking good,
and this challenge is back on.

823
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,850
You're gonna be here for ten minutes,

824
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,850
twice as long as that first section.

825
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,380
Teeny with movement,
but a nice recovery.

826
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,950
It's tiny little moves to save that.

827
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,110
She's doing it.

828
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,450
Genevieve with a nice save.

829
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,310
Was nearly off the end,
and she pulled it back.

830
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,650
Rachel's ball on the move.

831
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,180
She cannot recover.

832
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,980
Rachel's out. We're down to four.

833
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,280
Genevieve's ball on the move
again. Can she recover again?

834
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,180
Genevieve cannot stop it this time.

835
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,610
Genevieve is out.

836
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,880
She earned the advantage
to get the shot.

837
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,550
Couldn't capitalize on it.

838
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,310
And we are down to three.

839
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,050
Kyle locked in.

840
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,550
Sue locked in.

841
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,180
Teeny locked in.

842
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,780
We got a challenge.

843
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,510
Little bit of movement by Sue.

844
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,510
Teeny, out of nowhere, drops.

845
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,510
She's out. We are down to two

846
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,410
Kyle versus Sue.

847
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,050
They're side by side,
and Sue's ball is on the move.

848
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,650
Just 30 seconds left in this round.

849
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,350
If you can survive this round,

850
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,850
you get to grab that ball,

851
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,080
and you get a fresh start.

852
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,256
Kyle's ball hasn't moved in a long time,

853
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,680
but neither had Teeny's until suddenly,

854
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,280
it dropped, and she was out.

855
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,610
That's how fast
this challenge will get you.

856
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,880
Sue with a lot of movement.

857
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,310
Can she hang on
for another ten seconds?

858
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,380
Five, four,

859
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,980
three, two, one.

860
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,280
You're both safe, you move on
to the final round. Nice job.

861
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,380
Amazing.

862
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,310
All right, Kyle and Sue,

863
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,910
move down to that final section.

864
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,980
One toe has to be touching the paint.

865
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,680
Balance your ball again.

866
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,110
Both of you look really good.

867
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,480
This challenge is back on.

868
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,150
This is it.

869
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,610
Final round, final section.

870
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,326
Sue, out of the gate, ball is on the move,

871
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,750
but a nice recovery.

872
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,910
Slow, steady moves is what it takes.

873
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,180
Nice.

874
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,780
Another nice save by Sue.

875
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,410
Wow.

876
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,650
Sue trying to get that ball
back under control.

877
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,180
She's doing a nice job
of little movements

878
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,610
to move it back toward the center.

879
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,450
Kyle with a lot of movement.

880
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,050
- Ooh.
- Sue with another nice save.

881
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,780
And another nice save.

882
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,810
Sue can't do it. Sue drops.

883
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,480
Kyle wins first individual community.

884
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,480
My moose, my baby boy.

885
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,410
Thank you.

886
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,280
Kyle safe tonight at Tribal Council,

887
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,580
first person to earn the merge Buff,

888
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
and will enjoy food this afternoon.

889
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,810
What a day.

890
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,380
- Slayer.
- Good job, Kyle!

891
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,280
Kyle, come on over.

892
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,510
Kyle!

893
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,150
Congratulations.

894
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,580
Thanks, bro.

895
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,810
First person to wear
the individual immunity necklace

896
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,910
from <i>Survivor</i> 47.

897
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,880
- It looks good on you.
- Thank you.

898
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,256
With this, you are safe tonight
at Tribal Council.

899
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,610
With this, your merge Buff...
go ahead and open it.

900
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,150
- Go, Kyle.
- This means

901
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,810
you are the first person

902
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,580
of <i>Survivor</i> 47 to earn the merge.

903
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,150
- Sick.
- Yay!

904
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,780
Look at that, man.

905
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,180
How does that feel?

906
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,580
You just went through a lot
to earn that Buff.

907
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,480
You know, Jeff, it feels really good.

908
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,650
And, anybody that

909
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,850
knows me out here understands that

910
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,510
I'm here for my family and my kids,

911
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,210
and when I give it, I give it a buck 20,

912
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,680
and I do it for my family.

913
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,310
Well done. All right, Kyle,

914
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,010
safe tonight at Tribal Council,

915
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,350
the only person

916
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,010
who will be safe tonight at Tribal Council.

917
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,310
To complicate things
a little more, though,

918
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,180
Kyle, you, along with Genevieve,
Sam, Sierra,

919
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,950
Rachel, Sue and Teeny

920
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,810
you're all going to enjoy a meal

921
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,050
at a separate part of camp.

922
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,350
So you will be fueling your body
and you will be bonding,

923
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,950
while Gabe, Sol, Caroline,

924
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,150
Tiyana, Andy and Rome are

925
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,050
at another part of camp
wondering what is going on.

926
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,110
And later in the afternoon, you'll all

927
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,350
come together and start to talk.

928
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,550
All right, grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

929
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,910
See you tonight at Tribal.

930
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,080
<i>I am the first merged member.</i>

931
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,180
Huge check mark on <i>Survivor</i>
bucket list. Thank you.

932
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,180
<i>I'm really excited now that
I have my name off the table.</i>

933
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,386
<i>So everybody's gonna have
to do some scurrying around.</i>

934
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,510
<i>They're gonna have
to paint their own pictures.</i>

935
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,710
<i>And I have a pretty good idea</i>

936
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,850
<i>of who the picture's getting painted of.</i>

937
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,686
When the pressure
of Tribal Council is looming

938
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,550
is when the great players shine.

939
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,680
Think that's you? Apply to be on <i>Survivor.</i>

940
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,380
My God!

941
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,580
<i>Walking into the feast</i>

942
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,550
<i>is like.</i>

943
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,550
<i>Thanksgiving afternoon when Mom says,</i>

944
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,950
"Food's ready,"

945
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,080
and the football game's about to kick off.

946
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,086
- Charcuterie! - Charcuterie.
- Look at. Charcuterie.

947
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,050
<i>I've been craving charcuterie.</i>

948
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,850
<i>Since, like, day three
out here, I've been asking,</i>

949
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,550
"Jeff, get me some meats and cheeses

950
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,350
to put into my belly, please."

951
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,480
<i>And so, I see this big old platter</i>

952
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,280
<i>of salami and pepperoni and prosciutto</i>

953
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,880
<i>and every cheese that</i>

954
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,550
I don't even know the name of,
but I know I want to eat it.

955
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,910
<i>I know right away,</i>

956
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,256
"You're gonna make yourself sick,

957
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,510
and you're okay with that."

958
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,056
Wait. Should I do my first pineapple?

959
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,710
- My first pineapple, Si?
-. Yes!

960
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,256
- Yes! - Let's go. Cheers.
- First pineapple ever.

961
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,960
- Cheers. Pineapple!
- Cheers to Pineapple.

962
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,180
Take a chug.

963
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,750
Breaking news. Sam's a pineapple guy.

964
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,350
<i>After a few sips of wine,</i>

965
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,910
<i>I was almost impatient in
waiting for somebody to bring up</i>

966
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,380
the fact that we have a vote tonight,

967
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,780
<i>and we are all still vulnerable.</i>

968
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,056
<i>And even though we pulled out
this big win, it doesn't mean</i>

969
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,256
that one of us might not
be going home tonight.

970
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,310
I know the big question,
million-dollar question.

971
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,426
- Are you guys saying Rome?
- I'm gonna go with the majority.

972
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,010
- I'll vote with everybody else.
- I'm voting majority. - Yeah.

973
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,850
- I want Rome to go tonight.
- I'll do Rome.

974
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,550
<i>Sitting down at this merge
feast, there's only one hombre</i>

975
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,180
with an immunity necklace,
and that he is me.

976
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,350
<i>I don't have a vote tonight,
but Rome has got to go.</i>

977
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,980
Dude's a rat, man. I...

978
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,256
You can't trust that... for nothing.

979
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,180
Okay, so are we all
in agreeance tonight?

980
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

981
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,080
I think everybody here

982
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,050
would be very happy
voting Rome tonight.

983
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,010
My concern is I would love it
if there was a second name.

984
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,910
- Yeah.
- Are you guys okay with Andy?

985
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,050
<i>Even though Rome is, like,</i>

986
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,710
everybody's, like, number one name

987
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,650
that they want to write down
at Tribal Council,

988
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,780
<i>we do need to have a backup,
whether Rome has an idol,</i>

989
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
<i>whether he plays a Shot in the Dark.</i>

990
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,610
<i>Andy's somebody I've been working with,</i>

991
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,880
<i>but he's been sloppy
throughout this whole game.</i>

992
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,280
<i>So it's like,</i>

993
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,380
"You know, sure."

994
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:39,926
Teeny, I can't have you
getting too drunk here.

995
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,450
You got to hold it together

996
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:42,850
- through Tribal for me.
- Yeah.

997
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,910
I'm gonna need, like, a buddy.

998
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,650
It's like every single crevice is

999
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,380
- covered in mud.
- A wild day.

1000
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,110
Biggest Tribal Council ev...

1001
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,010
Like, damn, that is, like,
an insane twist that he threw.

1002
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,256
<i>As opposed to years past</i>

1003
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,956
in the new era where,
you know, at this stage,

1004
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,456
you only have six
or seven people vulnerable,

1005
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,256
<i>everybody except for Kyle,</i>

1006
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,280
<i>who won individual immunity</i>

1007
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,180
<i>we're all on the chopping block tonight.</i>

1008
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,256
I'm one of those people, so,

1009
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,050
<i>that's something that is both
exciting and scary.</i>

1010
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,650
- 'Cause...
- No, stay.

1011
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,856
Every single person
on this island knows about it,

1012
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,126
and every single person will know

1013
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,426
- what we're doing tonight.
- Yeah.

1014
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,910
<i>This three-way,</i>

1015
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,950
<i>shared amulet... it's something that</i>

1016
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,480
myself, Caroline and Teeny agreed

1017
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,280
<i>to take just because we didn't
all want to lose our votes</i>

1018
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,580
<i>on that journey that we went on together.</i>

1019
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,650
<i>And so, the best option is
to get these off of our hands,</i>

1020
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,450
<i>play 'em in a public way,</i>

1021
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:42,050
and we do it tonight, and we go
into the merge with no targets

1022
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,280
<i>on our back.</i>

1023
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,450
I'm so happy with Rome.

1024
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,110
I mean, I think everybody wants Rome...

1025
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,780
- Right.
- Right.

1026
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,256
<i>Earlier, at Lavo,</i>

1027
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,780
I was struggling with Rome.

1028
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,560
<i>I don't think
anyone has meditated out here</i>

1029
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,010
<i>more than I have, and I've had
to do it because of Rome.</i>

1030
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,810
I have the biggest hermit crab
I've ever seen in my life.

1031
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,980
- My God.
- I'm ready to eat.

1032
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,710
<i>He's a pain in my ass, so,</i>

1033
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,480
to finally, like, have a chance

1034
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,280
<i>to take out the Rome show</i>

1035
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,750
<i>feels like Christmas morning.</i>

1036
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,680
What are you thinking for tonight?

1037
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
My God.

1038
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,910
I'm trying to think if it won't be Kyle...

1039
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,180
<i>The second that Kyle won
individual immunity,</i>

1040
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,256
I knew, "Okay, all the seeds
I've been planting about Kyle?"

1041
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,380
"Ooh! They got to go out
the window, and I got

1042
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,080
<i>to come up with a new plan."</i>

1043
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,550
<i>So guess who I want out the game?</i>

1044
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,680
I mean, there's only one person
that's been, like,

1045
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,256
genuinely mean to me at different times

1046
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,680
in this game, and that's Sol.

1047
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,550
Sol. So guess what I used?

1048
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,410
I used one little thing

1049
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,680
that Sol said during the challenge today.

1050
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,010
Did you hear him when, like,

1051
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,256
- we dropped the ball twice?
- We were, like...

1052
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,356
Did you hear him yell at me?

1053
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,610
He tries to be encouraging

1054
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,256
and all this stuff, but
he literally just makes me feel

1055
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,856
like such a little person,
like, and it sucks.

1056
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,310
Yeah. It's, like, such a... Yeah.

1057
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,256
'Cause, like, I already, like, have

1058
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,580
I already have, like,
self-esteem and, like,

1059
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,110
pride issues with, like, myself
and, like, not being able

1060
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,126
to do things and, like,
you know, things like that.

1061
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,680
So when someone's, like, they're
not believing in me, clearly,

1062
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,620
- it just... it sucks.
- It doesn't help. Yeah.

1063
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,910
- I don't want to deal with it anymore.
- I know.

1064
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,850
<i>I might have shed a little crocodile tear</i>

1065
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,050
here, too, talking about my pride

1066
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,256
and how...
how Sol's been demeaning me.

1067
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,600
So, it was, like... it was rough.

1068
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,310
I didn't want to deal with it.

1069
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,256
- I don't want to play with people like this.
- Yeah.

1070
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,256
<i>You could tell Caroline and Tiyana</i>

1071
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,810
<i>they were like, "man,
that's just not right."</i>

1072
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,956
And as long as I can keep
on playing on people's emotions,

1073
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,350
I feel like I'll at least
be good to go for tonight.

1074
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,256
Well, I mean, we were just trying

1075
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,256
to hear where his head was at.

1076
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,050
He said, "Well, the only person out here

1077
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,386
who's been mean to me is Sol,
so, I'd like to vote for Sol."

1078
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,480
That was it.

1079
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,010
<i>I do not like that Rome
is putting a target on my back.</i>

1080
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,550
But honestly, I expected it.

1081
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,256
I mean, he's been trying to get me out

1082
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,350
since our first Tribal Council.

1083
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,850
Hello?

1084
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,350
- Where are they?
- Yo.

1085
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,580
<i>The one thing, though,
that I have going for me</i>

1086
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,550
<i>is that Rome's ego is gigantic.</i>

1087
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,480
<i>And right now, everyone
is pumping that thing up,</i>

1088
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,710
and it's getting bigger
and bigger and bigger.

1089
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,110
Can I give you, like, a big hug?

1090
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,920
- Of course you can give me a hug.
- Good.

1091
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,410
<i>Tonight, you need seven votes</i>

1092
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,280
to get Sol out of the game. Kyle

1093
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,580
<i>does not have a vote tonight.</i>

1094
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,480
Dude, that immunity necklace is so cool.

1095
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,510
I have a damn bat tattooed on my back.

1096
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:24,280
<i>There's also three amulets.</i>

1097
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,010
<i>We don't know what those three
amulets are gonna be doing.</i>

1098
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,780
<i>The only crazy thing that I can see</i>

1099
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,056
happening tonight is those
three amulets playing it on Sol.

1100
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,280
<i>But Caroline does not like Sol
at all right now.</i>

1101
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,680
I'm feeling, like, at peace with this vote.

1102
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,480
<i>So I do not see that happening
whatsoever.</i>

1103
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,880
It's a good feeling.

1104
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,680
So, the big thing is is to get the people

1105
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,350
that have the influence
down to vote out Sol.

1106
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,950
Really?

1107
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,580
<i>Okay, sure. That's one plan.</i>

1108
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,710
Unbeknownst to Rome,

1109
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,410
Rome is the other plan.

1110
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,710
So right now, the plan is gonna be Sol.

1111
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,110
Okay.

1112
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,010
Hey, that's great, Rome.

1113
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,710
You keep throwing Sol's name around.

1114
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,180
Gonna be Sol tonight, so...

1115
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,180
Yeah.

1116
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,586
It's looking like it's gonna be Sol.

1117
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,850
Okay. Is everyone on board?

1118
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,710
<i>I think I might be a little bit</i>

1119
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,750
<i>of a mastermind right now, you know?</i>

1120
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,310
I got a plan in motion.
I've been setting the seeds.

1121
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:20,580
Did you hear about it?

1122
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,180
- What? Sol?
- Yeah.

1123
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,350
<i>The fact there's 13 people
in the game and I can</i>

1124
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:27,210
corral this many people to vote my way?

1125
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,810
That must say a lot
about how I'm playing the game.

1126
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,550
<i>You guys all heard</i>

1127
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,210
the real plan?

1128
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,080
- Yes. Okay.
- Perfect.

1129
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,280
Yeah.

1130
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,350
And I actually feel like
Rome is comfortable.

1131
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,726
Yeah, I feel like he's comfortable, too.

1132
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,886
They did a lot of work today.

1133
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,150
We did. We friggin' babied him.

1134
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,150
Thank you.

1135
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,110
- I love you. Stop it.
- Thank you.

1136
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,050
- Right.
- Thing is, does he have anything?

1137
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,380
And if he does?

1138
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,040
And if he does, we need something else.

1139
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,280
- I appreciate this.
- Yeah.

1140
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,310
Rome's coming.

1141
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,780
<i>Tonight is about</i>

1142
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,256
<i>sending a message to Sol,
letting him know</i>

1143
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,380
that I won the war.

1144
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,380
Everyone's voting Rome,

1145
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,850
and then Sol is voting Andy.

1146
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,650
<i>It's all good. I'm gonna be</i>

1147
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,310
<i>feasting on Sol's bones tonight.</i>

1148
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,680
<i>I got a big old smile
on my face because it's feeling</i>

1149
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,650
like everything's gonna be rolling my way.

1150
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:39,510
Okay. Cool.

1151
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,810
<i>Man, like, I am running this game.</i>

1152
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,810
<i>This ain't even Magic versus Larry.</i>

1153
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,256
<i>This is Michael Jordan versus.</i>

1154
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,850
Kirk Hinrich, all right? This is

1155
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,956
this is not even a competition
right now, all right?

1156
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,820
I'm playing this game
on a whole 'nother level.

1157
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,550
<i>I'm on</i> Survivor, <i>baby, and
I'm leading a mastermind vote</i>

1158
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,710
<i>at a potential historic
Tribal Council. It might be</i>

1159
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,810
<i>a Rome game or a home game,
and, Sol,</i>

1160
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,610
I'm sorry, it might be
a home game for you, buddy.

1161
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,140
Wow.

1162
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,410
There are so many torches here.

1163
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:35,450
It's reflecting parts of Tribal Council

1164
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,950
I haven't even seen until tonight.

1165
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,910
All right, so let's talk about the twists.

1166
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,280
Only one person is safe

1167
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,650
at the merge vote.

1168
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,010
Andy, what did you see this afternoon?

1169
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,040
'Cause I'm guessing everybody thought

1170
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,910
it's a lot more dangerous.

1171
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,310
Yeah. I mean, there's just this insecurity,

1172
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,040
a little bit. There's just, like...

1173
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,750
You just want to be safe. You want

1174
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,350
that pretty, pretty purple Buff.
Everyone wants that.

1175
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,850
And so, we're all trying

1176
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,380
to portray that we are trustworthy,

1177
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,350
we're a good number.

1178
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,550
And so, everyone's
playing this little tango,

1179
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:08,980
and it's fun to be a part of,

1180
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,450
- but it's scary.
- And Rome,

1181
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,350
you got this big group of people, so,

1182
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,310
you're trying to get to know each other,

1183
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,890
but you're also watching other people

1184
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,790
watching you, trying
to get to know each other.

1185
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:20,280
Well, it's only been,
you know, a little over

1186
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,910
24 hours that everyone's
been on the same beach

1187
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,850
and been able to get used to each other.

1188
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:28,256
So, right here, you got to
really build trust very quickly.

1189
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,110
And I think the big thing today is just

1190
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,960
don't ruffle feathers. If you hear a plan,

1191
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,140
"All right, I guess that's the plan."

1192
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,280
Kyle, what did you notice in terms of

1193
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,910
the scrambling, given that
you're the only one

1194
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,080
with the purple Buff,
so you had no stress today?

1195
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,140
I wouldn't say "no stress."

1196
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,850
Just sitting back, I can see

1197
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,850
that many individuals
walk off off together,

1198
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,310
and it happened so frequently, I think

1199
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,380
a lot of people are trying to fact-check

1200
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,040
to make sure that there wasn't a bunch

1201
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,810
of phony baloney getting tossed around

1202
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,256
of this twisted-up conundrum that

1203
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,810
we've created on a beach.

1204
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,610
Sol, what kind of conversations
did you have today?

1205
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,110
Well, even going back to yesterday,

1206
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,586
like, there was an advantage out there,

1207
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,180
and we all looked for, like,
one minute, and then

1208
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,580
- we all came back, and it was, like...
- For one minute?!

1209
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,040
I mean, it was... it was surprising, like...

1210
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,880
- Pretty much.
- There's a few people

1211
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,550
that were concerned we were
gonna let you down, Jeff.

1212
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:20,040
Taking notes, but not let down.

1213
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,580
So, Rome, is it possible

1214
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,380
advantages are starting
to be seen as disadvantages?

1215
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,180
Well, the amulet is for sure

1216
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,480
seemed like a disadvantage.

1217
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,886
That's why the people with the amulets

1218
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,256
tonight are gonna be

1219
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,486
getting rid of it
and getting it out of the game,

1220
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,180
- because...
- My heart is breaking.

1221
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,180
So, you don't think
that's a good advantage?

1222
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,940
- No, they... I'm...
- School me.

1223
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,256
Maybe you should be sitting here.

1224
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,626
If you want to trade for tonight, I

1225
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,550
Rome, come over and sit here.

1226
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,650
Tell the group... and I will listen

1227
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,480
why the Amulet Advantage is not good.

1228
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,256
All right, so,

1229
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,750
we've got an Amulet Advantage
out there right now.

1230
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,550
We know that three people

1231
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:01,080
have the amulet. They all went

1232
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,340
on a journey together.
Usually when you go on journeys,

1233
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,916
when you come back, you tell
your whole tribe

1234
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,280
what happened. So everyone knows who

1235
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,880
has the amulets right now.

1236
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,110
And everyone knows that the
amulet by itself has no power.

1237
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,610
You have to use it together

1238
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,610
- with the other two people.
- I mean...

1239
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,380
So, the only options is,

1240
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,880
target the other two people

1241
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,280
so that you have all the power
with the amulet,

1242
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,850
or say, "I don't want
to be one of the two targets."

1243
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,380
"Let me just go ahead and
get rid of this thing right now.

1244
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,010
"We'll use it together.

1245
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,556
- "That way we don't have a target on our back."
- Wow.

1246
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,140
And I think that, as a group,

1247
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,680
sums up the Amulet Advantage
right now in the game.

1248
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,450
Well done. Well done.
Get back over there.

1249
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:38,650
Get back over there.

1250
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,140
- Wow.
- That was great.

1251
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,750
- That was better said than...
- Duly noted.

1252
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:44,856
Thank you. That was awesome,
being able to sit there.

1253
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,280
You know, like, I love hosting,

1254
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,710
I love commentating, and

1255
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,610
you literally have my dream job,
so the fact

1256
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:52,110
I even got to do that for 30
seconds right there, that just

1257
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,986
made the...
That meant the world to me, man.

1258
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,386
Seriously, I'm about to cry.
Like, that was...

1259
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,650
- Really?
- Yeah, seriously.

1260
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,280
Like, that was... that was a lot.

1261
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,880
I appreciate it. Thank you, man.

1262
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,156
Well, I don't want to make light of it

1263
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,580
because I know this is a great job.

1264
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:06,040
I have the best job
I'll ever have in my life.

1265
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,840
Rome, I know. And I hope

1266
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,486
you're not coming for it, even though

1267
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,610
I'd love to be your protégé
one day, man. I'd love it.

1268
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,040
- All right, for now, we'll stick to playing.
- Yeah.

1269
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,710
And I'm-I'm glad we had that.

1270
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,710
We'll talk later. Yeah.

1271
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,650
All right. Gabe, let's talk about

1272
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,040
the deliciousness of a blindside,

1273
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,180
because everybody here

1274
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,140
has been involved
in a blindside this season,

1275
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,410
either as one of the architects

1276
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,310
or as somebody who was
on the wrong side of it

1277
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,550
- and survived it.
- Well,

1278
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,980
an interesting word that you used

1279
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,080
in that question was "architect," right?

1280
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,180
When it comes to blindsides,
it's not important

1281
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,810
for me to be the architect
of a blindside, necessarily.

1282
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,140
What's important to me is

1283
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,800
that I know where the votes are going.

1284
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,110
Rome, where do you stand
on blindsides?

1285
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,110
I think blindsides are really only fun

1286
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,510
when you're in on the vote.

1287
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,710
When you witness it and you weren't

1288
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,450
part of the blindside, you can
feel blindsided yourself.

1289
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,840
Andy, how about for you?

1290
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,280
Blindsiding Anika was fun as hell, dude.

1291
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,386
It was super fun.
It was the most fun I've had

1292
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:08,680
out here because, you know,
my name's been in her mouth

1293
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,980
since day one, since day two.

1294
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,810
And so, to see her shock, it just shows

1295
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,450
it was a job well done.

1296
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,580
All right. So, Caroline,

1297
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,680
tonight's vote is big

1298
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,480
because you want to make the merge.

1299
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,256
Why is that significant?

1300
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,710
When I am watching the show,
and you hear

1301
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,626
the confessionals of people
talking about the merge,

1302
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,256
everyone says,
"This is where the game starts.

1303
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,880
"This is where you separate okay players

1304
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,350
from great players."

1305
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,280
And the stakes are so high
'cause we're all

1306
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,350
itching and craving
and wanting that experience.

1307
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,310
Andy, you were nodding.

1308
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,380
Every single day out here is a lesson,

1309
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,550
is a gift, is its own adventure.

1310
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,410
I don't want to minimize that experience

1311
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,940
if I lose out tonight.

1312
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,350
But when you think about
the legacy of <i>Survivor,</i>

1313
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,780
you're like, "I'm a pre-merger."

1314
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,040
Like, that's your identity.

1315
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,310
And so, you want
to be known as someone who

1316
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:00,080
made an impact in this game,
and it starts tonight.

1317
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,280
And if you just miss out,
you're going to feel the FOMO.

1318
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,840
All right, well,

1319
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,040
one thing seems very clear to me.

1320
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,280
Tonight's vote is gonna be
great news for 12 people

1321
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:14,910
devastating for one person.

1322
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:16,256
Hot take.

1323
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,810
It is time to vote. Andy, you're up.

1324
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,880
Come on, now. Don't ever
put my name out like that.

1325
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:50,410
They say Rome wasn't built in a day,

1326
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,940
but your game
sure was destroyed in one.

1327
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,380
I think everybody has finally caughten up

1328
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,040
to the way that I feel about you.

1329
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,140
Man.

1330
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,810
I just don't want Sol on the jury,

1331
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,356
'cause I know he'd never vote for me.

1332
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,780
Dude can't stand me, so,

1333
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,940
Sol, I know it's already
gonna be you tonight,

1334
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,110
so I'm gonna shake things up a bit.

1335
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,810
I'll go tally the votes.

1336
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:41,450
If anybody has an advantage or an idol

1337
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,550
and you want to play it,
now would be the time

1338
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,380
to do so.

1339
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,980
Jeff?

1340
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,280
I have one I'd like to play.

1341
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,410
Other people as well?

1342
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,710
- Yes.
- Wonderful.

1343
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,510
Would you like to be

1344
00:59:58,610 --> 00:59:59,980
our spokesperson?

1345
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,640
Sure. All right.

1346
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,910
Assuming everyone
who has an amulet agrees,

1347
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:06,380
I would love to play my amulet for Teeny.

1348
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,010
- Agreed.
- Yes.

1349
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,350
All right.

1350
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:10,710
Yeah, I can't say "no" to that.

1351
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:11,910
Plot twist.

1352
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,380
Thank you.

1353
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:20,580
These are the three amulets

1354
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,040
that, when played together

1355
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,840
for the same person, do form an idol.

1356
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,680
Any votes cast for Teeny will not count.

1357
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,010
I'll read the votes.

1358
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,350
Sam.

1359
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,610
Andy. One vote Sam, one vote Andy.

1360
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,410
Andy. That's two votes Andy,
one vote Sam.

1361
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,740
Rome.

1362
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,780
That's two votes Andy,
one vote Sam, one vote Rome.

1363
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,480
Rome. We're tied. Two votes Andy,

1364
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,040
two votes Rome, one vote Sam.

1365
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,610
Rome. That's three votes Rome,
two votes Andy,

1366
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,640
one vote Sam.

1367
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:21,110
Rome. That's four votes Rome,

1368
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,940
two votes Andy, one vote Sam.

1369
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,110
Rome. That's five votes Rome,

1370
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,280
two votes Andy, one vote Sam.

1371
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,350
Sixth person voted out
of <i>Survivor</i> 47: Rome.

1372
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,140
That's six, that's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

1373
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,380
- Good game, you guys.
- Sorry, Rome.

1374
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,880
- Good game, man. - Good game, Rome.
- Sorry. Good game.

1375
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,040
Just want to say thank you guys
all for the experience.

1376
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,856
It was awesome getting
to play with you all.

1377
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,140
Got to live out a dream.

1378
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,680
I got to sit in your seat.

1379
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,256
It's all love for all you guys.
You guys don't got

1380
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,156
to worry about nothing.
I appreciate you all, man.

1381
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,980
Thank you.

1382
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,280
Rome, the tribe has spoken.

1383
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,010
Time for you to go.

1384
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,840
- Can I get a hug?
- Course.

1385
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,310
Aw.

1386
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,610
You got it.

1387
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,010
All right, you guys, all love,
man. I appreciate you all.

Congratulations.

You have made the merge.

1391
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,040
Pass it around,
pass it around. Take a Buff

1392
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,480
and put it on.

1393
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,480
Guys, let's go.

1394
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,380
It's gorgeous.

1395
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,256
It smells really good.

01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,780
The game continues.

1401
