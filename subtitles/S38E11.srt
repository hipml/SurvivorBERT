1
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,301
>> WARDOG, LIKE, I JUST FELT
LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF LIES AND

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,303
SCHEMES GOING ON FROM HIM THAT I
WASN'T--

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,889
>> KEEP BEING HONEST WITH THIS
GUY.

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:15,765
>> THAT I DIDN'T RESPECT.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,437
>>
>> KEEP BEING HONEST WITH THIS

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,438
GUY.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,273
TRIBAL COUNCIL DID NOT GO
ACCORDING TO MY PLAN.

8
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,441
WARDOG GETS VOTED OUT.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,818
I FELT LIKE I HAD A GREAT
RELATIONSHIP WITH RON, BUT THIS

10
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,113
IS THE SECOND TIME HE'S LIED TO
ME AND GOTTEN RID OF SOMEONE I

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:30,989
WORK WITH.

12
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,116
SO I'M IN A DESPERATE SITUATION
RIGHT NOW.

13
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,535
>> WOULD YOU TALK TO ME FOR A
MINUTE?

14
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,745
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, MAN.

15
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,164
>> AFTER WE VOTE OUT WARDOG,
EVERYONE IS HAPPY WITH ME EXCEPT

16
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,959
FOR DEVONS BECAUSE I'VE LIED TO
HIM EVERY TRIBAL.

17
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,628
SO I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO
BRING HIM BACK CLOSER.

18
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,173
MY GOAL HAS BEEN TO MAKE
EVERYONE THINK I'M WORKING WITH

19
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,633
THEM, BECAUSE WHEN EVERYONE
THINKS YOU'RE ON THEIR SIDE,

20
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,551
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE YOU
OUT.

21
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,012
THE FIVE OF THEM ARE VOTING YOU
OUT NEXT.

22
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:54,846
>> YEAH.

23
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,307
>> THEY, THEY ARE, BUT I HAVE AN
IDOL.

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,602
I FOUND THIS SECRET ADVANTAGE ON
THE VERY FIRST DAY ON THE BOAT

25
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,770
THAT WE ARRIVED IN.

26
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,520
IT'S EXPIRED.

27
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,814
BUT HE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW
THAT.

28
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,150
I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE TO YOU TO
SHOW YOU I'M LOYAL AND YOU CAN

29
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:07,734
TRUST ME.

30
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,318
>> OH, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

31
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,322
>> IT MEANT A LOT TO HIM.

32
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,324
AND NOW HE MAY RELAX THINKING
THAT HE'S SAFE.

33
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,203
THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF HIM AND SEND HIM

34
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,997
HOME.

35
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,375
>> SO RON GIVES ME THIS LITTLE
MENU, WHICH PLAYS JUST LEAK A

36
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,211
REGULAR HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

37
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,295
NOT TOO SHABBY.

38
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:31,674
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHY RON
WOULD GIVE THIS TO ME.

39
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,176
LIKE, TOTALLY CONFUSED.

40
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:33,593
THANKS, MAN.

41
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,761
>> NO PROBLEM.

42
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,347
>> I HOPE THAT I DON'T HAVE TO
RELY ON THIS ADVANTAGE, SO I

43
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,183
NEED TO KEEP TRYING TO PLAY AS
HARDAISE CAN.

44
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,518
BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC.

45
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:55,198
I'M THE PHOENIX, AND I KEEP
RISING FROM THE ASHES.

46
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:07,669
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

47
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,172
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE.

48
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:17,512
LAST TIME WE RAN THIS CHALLENGE
WAS NEARLY A DECADE AGO.

49
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,056
"SURVIVOR: HEROES VERSUS
VILLAINS."

50
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,392
PLAYERS AND THEIR LOVED ONES.

51
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,351
CHALLENGE IS GOOD TO GO.

52
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,436
ALL WE'RE MISSING IS IS THE
LOVED ONES.

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,897
CUE THE MUSIC.

54
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,066
DEVENS, HERE'S YOUR WIFE, BECCA.

55
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:30,525
COME ON OUT.

56
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,401
>> SHE'S GORGEOUS.

57
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,112
>> SHE IS GORGEOUS, ISN'T SHE.

58
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:34,487
>> OH, MY GOD!

59
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,072
YOUR BEARD!

60
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,908
YOU LOOK GREAT!

61
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:44,414
>> YOU LOOK GREAT.

62
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,958
>> JEFF PUT THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE ON ME YESTERDAY?

63
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,084
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS!

64
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,419
>> YEAH.

65
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,088
>> Jeff: SO, BECCA, WHAT'S IT
LIKE FOR YOU BACK HOME?

66
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:56,885
>> OUR SON, JACK, HE DOESN'T
KNOW WHERE RICK IS.

67
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,554
HE ASKS ABOUT HIM, BUT HE'S NOT,
LIKE, FREAKING OUT.

68
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,097
NOBODY IS FREAKING OUT.

69
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,601
>> Jeff: DOES THAT TRIGGER YOU
AT ALL WHEN SHE BRINGS UP YOUR

70
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,102
SON AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE
YOU ARE.

71
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,772
>> HALFWAY INTO THE GAME THAT
WAS A DEVASTATING THING TO THINK

72
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,401
ABOUT, BUT NOW, DOWN THE HOME
STRETCH, JACK IS GOING TO SEE

73
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,570
JEFF PUT THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE
ON ME.

74
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,613
IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME.

75
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,907
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY SPECIAL.

76
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,741
THEY ONLY GIVE ME STRENGTH NOW.

77
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,659
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GIVE HIM A
BIG HUG.

78
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,619
>> I LOVE YOU.

79
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,162
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

80
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,289
>> Jeff: JULIE, ARE YOU READY
FOR SOME LOVE?

81
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,916
GET YOUR HUSBAND OUT HERE.

82
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:35,423
MARK, COME ON OUT.

83
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,093
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

84
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,262
>> I'M GOOD.

85
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,138
HOW ABOUT YOU?

86
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,641
>> Jeff: SHE ASKS IF HE'S
OKAY.

87
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,683
>> OH, MY GOD.

88
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,100
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

89
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,310
>> THANK YOU.

90
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,021
>> Jeff: JULIE, IS A BIG PART
OF THE REASON YOU'RE OUT HERE IS

91
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:50,980
JUST A TEST FOR YOURSELF?

92
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,607
>> ABSOLUTELY.

93
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,484
I'VE BEEN SAYING IT SINCE DAY
ONE, I WANT TO PUSH MYSELF TO

94
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,780
THE LIMITS AND PROVE TO MYSELF,
LIKE, I KNOW I HAVE THIS ININNER

95
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,116
STRENGTH THEY DON'T ALWAYS SHOW
BACK AT HOME TO THE PEOPLE I'M

96
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,326
WITH.

97
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,828
BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS
THAT I UNDERESTIMATE MYSELF.

98
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,371
>> Jeff: DO YOU THINK THAT'S
CHANGING?

99
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,330
>> FOR SURE.

100
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,583
YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE HOW MUCH
I'VE CHANGED.

101
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,628
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO
BE A DIFFERENT PERSON WHEN I GET

102
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,879
BACK.

103
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:19,342
LIKE, I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M GOING
TO BE A BETTER WIFE AND MOTHER.

104
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:19,968
>> YOU'RE PRETTY GREAT.

105
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,886
YOU DON'T TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

106
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,513
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, MARK, GIVE
HER A BIG HUG.

107
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,307
LAWREB, ARE YOU READY FOR SOME
LOVE?

108
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:35,358
HERE'S YOUR DAD, JOEY.

109
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:42,824
HERE'S YOUR DAD, JOEY.

110
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,539
>> Jeff: LAUREN, I DON'T WANT
TO DOES WHAT YOU WHISPERED IN

111
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:54,210
YOUR DAD'S EERK BUT WHAT'S THE
ESSENCE OF THE COMMUNICATION

112
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,378
COMOOUKS?

113
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,671
IS THAT YOU NEED HIM TO KNOW
YOU'RE OKAY OR YOU NEED HIM TO

114
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,422
MAKE YOU OKAY?

115
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,381
>> I THINK IT'S A LITTLE OF
BOTH.

116
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,550
MY DAD IS MY ROCK.

117
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,095
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN THROUGH
EVERYTHING WITH ME.

118
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:08,933
AND IT'S JUST BEEN THE HARDEST
THING EVER NOT HAVING HIM HERE.

119
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,686
>> Jeff: LAUREN, IF I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING, HOW LONG WOULD YOU

120
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,604
STAND THERE HUGGING YOUR DAD
LIKE THAT?

121
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,106
>> FOREVER.

122
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,274
>> Jeff: FOREVER.

123
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,484
ALL RIGHT, GIVE HER ONE LAST
HUG.

124
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,318
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

125
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,195
>> I LOVE YOU, BABY.

126
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,905
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

127
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,406
>> THANKS.

128
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,907
>> LET'S HAVE FUN.

129
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,243
>> Jeff: RON, LET'S GET YOUR
HUSBAND OUT HERE.

130
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:27,744
>> OH, MY GOD.

131
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,412
LLOYD, COME ON OUT!

132
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:34,792
LET'S SEE WHO MARRIED YOU.

133
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,880
>> OH, MAN!

134
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,089
>> I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

135
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,427
>> I MISSED YOU, TOO.

136
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,136
HOW'S MOM AND DAD?

137
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,596
>> THEY'RE GOOD.

138
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,805
EVERYBODY'S GOOD.

139
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,767
>> Jeff: RON, DESCRIBE THE
COMFORT, WHEN YOU CAN FALL INTO

140
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,811
THE ARMS OF YOUR PARTNER,
KNOWING IT'S SAFE?

141
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,105
>> I MEAN, HE'S MY PROTECTOR.

142
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,400
IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM THAT I CAN
DO STUFF LIKE THIS BECAUSE HE

143
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,610
MAKES ME FEEL SO SAFE.

144
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,697
IT'S JUST AN AMAZING FEELING TO
HAVE SOMEONE IN YOUR LIFE, NO

145
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,783
MATTER WHAT YOU WANT TO DO THEY
SAY, GFOR IT."

146
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,617
THEY'RE CHEERING FOR YOU 100%.

147
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,160
>> Jeff: THAT'S HUGE.

148
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,661
>> YOU HAVE FACIAL HAIR?

149
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,413
>> YOU LIKE IT.

150
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,623
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

151
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,250
THESE ARE MY NEW FRIENDS.

152
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,669
>> HE'S EVEN BETTER LOOKING THAN
YOU SAID HE WAS.

153
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,962
THIS IS GREAT.

154
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,838
>> I LOVE OUR LIFE.

155
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,467
AND I'M NEVER GOING TO TAKE IT
FOR GRANTED.

156
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,636
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LLOYD,
GIVE HIM A BIG HUG.

157
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,638
>> OF COURSE.

158
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,308

00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,603

>> I MISS YOU SO MUCH.

164
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,326
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

165
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,494
>> DON'T I LOOK CRAZY?

166
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,286
>> NO.

167
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,622
YOU LOOK LIKE A FRECKLE.

168
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,792
>> YOU SMELL GOOD.

169
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,627
>> "YOU SMELL GOOD."

170
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,795
>> BUG SPRAY.

171
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:07,051
<i>( LAUGHTER )</i>
>> Jeff: VICTORIA, WALK ME

172
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,178
THROUGH YOUR "SURVIVOR"
EXPERIENCE.

173
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,471
WHEN DID YOU FIRST START
WATCHING?

174
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:15,518
>> I STARTED WATCHING WHEN I WAS
LIKE SIX YEARS OLD WITH MY WHOLE

175
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,563
FAMILY, AND MY DAD IS JUST AS
BIG A FAN AS I AM SO I WAS JUST

176
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,024
DYING TO GET TO THIS MOMENT SO
WE COULD HAVE IT TOGETHER.

177
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,154
EVERY OTHER TIME I'VE CRIED IN
THIS GAME IS THINKING ABOUT THIS

178
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,029
MOMENT.

179
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,197
AND IT JUST MAKES ME A DIFFERENT
PERSON.

180
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:33,995
I CAN'T PRETEND THAT I'M, LIKE,
COLD ANYMORE.

181
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:34,537
>> SHE'S TOUGH.

182
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:34,912
SHE'S BEST.

183
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,830
>> Jeff: OH!

184
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,041
CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING BETTER FROM
YOUR DAD.

185
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,042
>> NO.

186
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,752
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GIVE HER A
LAST HUG, ROCK.

187
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,129
>> OH, BABY.

188
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:43,629
I LOVE YOU.

189
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,300
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

190
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,218
>> Jeff: AURORA, SOMEBODY HERE
FOR YOU.

191
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:54,682
LET'S GET YOUR BROTHER OUT HERE,
SHANE.

192
00:07:54,765 --> 00:08:10,072
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: THAT'S A HUG.

193
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,074
>> Jeff: TELL ME ABOUT YOUR
BROTHER, AURORA.

194
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,577
>> LIKE, I WOULDN'T BE THE
PERSON I AM TODAY WITHOUT HIM.

195
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,369
I WOULDN'T HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITIES I HAVE.

196
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,121
I WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING WITHOUT
HIM.

197
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,958
HE HAS BEEN MY BROTHER, MY
FATHER, MY PROTECTOR.

198
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,168
>> Jeff: WOW.

199
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,588
>> EVERYTHING I DO, I THINK OF
WHAT-- MAKING SURE I MAKE HIM

200
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,133
PROUD, AND THAT EVERY DAY I'M
THE PERSON HE THOUGHT I COULD

201
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,051
BE.

202
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,594
>> AND BEYOND WHAT I THOUGHT YOU
COULD BE.

203
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:36,057
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GIVE HIM A
BIG HUG.

204
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,391
>> STAY STRONG.

205
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:44,607
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
>> Jeff: GAVIN, YOU READY FOR

206
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,485
SOME LOVE?

207
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,571
WOW!

208
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,781
GAVIN DOESN'T CRY.

209
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:56,244
>> NO ONE ELSE KNOWS, BUT I WAS
SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED A WEEK

210
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,622
AFTER "SURVIVOR" STARTED, AND
CARLY MOVED UP THE WEDDING SO I

211
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:05,253
COULD COME OUT HERE, SO WE GOT
MARRIED TWO DAYS BEFORE.

212
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:10,091
>> Jeff: SO IT SEEMS ONLY
FITTING THAT SHE GETS TO SHARE

213
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:10,841
IN THIS WITH YOU.

214
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,760
CARLY, COME ON OUT.

215
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,262
>> OH, MY GOD!

216
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,764
>> I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

217
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,182
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

218
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,934
>> I LOVE YOU.

219
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,519
>> I LOVE YOU.

220
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,896
>> OH, MY GOD.

221
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,607
I LOOK AWFUL, DON'T I?

222
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,483
I'M SORRY.

223
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,484
I'M SORRY I LEFT.

224
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,695
>> OH, MY GOSH, TWO DAYS BEFORE.

225
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,906
>> Jeff: CARROLL, WHAT'S IT
LIKE FOR TO YOU HAVE A NEW

226
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,117
HUSBAND, AND THEN HE LEAVES?

227
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,662
>> IT'S SO OVERWHELMING TO HAVE
HIM LEAVE, YOU KNOW, RIGHT

228
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,121
AFTER.

229
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,164
IT WAS SO HARD.

230
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,791
BUT--
>> SO THIS IS OUR HONEYMOON.

231
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,711
<i>( LAUGHTER )</i>
EVER SINCE WE STARTED DATING,

232
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,339
SHE KNOWS I'VE BEEN A FAN OF
"SURVIVOR," AND, LIKE, THAT'S

233
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,591
BEEN MY DREAM.

234
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,844
BUT NOW THAT I'M OUT HERE ALL I
CAN THINK ABOUT IS GETTING BACK

235
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,678
HOME TO HER.

236
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,680
>> HE TALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE
TIME.

237
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,180
>> EVERY DAY.

238
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,016
>> THIS IS MY DREAM.

239
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,854
THIS IS-- "SURVIVOR" IS GREAT,
BUT, LIKE, THIS IS IT.

240
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:09,233
I COULDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING
MORE.

241
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:09,942
>> Jeff: WELL SAID.

242
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,029
ALL RIGHT, GIVE HER A LAST HUG.

243
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,533
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
>> CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

244

>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
TO THE CHALLENGE.

00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,709
BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T
FIGURED IT OUT, YOU ARE

SO PAY ATTENTION.

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,212
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,436
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR EYES YOU.

350
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,107
PICK ONE PLAYER AND THEIR LOVED
ONE TO JOIN YOU.

351
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,986
>> I LOVE EVERYBODY OVER THERE.

352
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,113
BUT I'M GOING TO PICK JULIE.

353
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:33,122
>> Jeff: OKAY, JULIE, COME ON
OVER.

354
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,126
ALL RIGHT, YOU GET TO PICK ONE
MORE PAIR.

355
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,128
BIG POLITICAL DECISION.

356
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,964
GAMES HAVE BEEN WON AND LOSTA
THIS POINT IN THE GAME.

357
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,257
>> I KNOW.

358
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,383
THEY REALLY BROKE MY HEART WHAT
I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND I

359
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,137
THINK THEY NEED A PROPER
HONEYMOON, SO I'M GOING TO PICK

360
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,140
GAVIN.

361
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,142
>> Jeff: GAVIN AND CARLY, COME
ON OVER.

362
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,229
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
ALL RIGHT, SURVIVORS, SAY

363
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,230
GOODBYE TO YOUR LOVED ONES.

364
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,191
TIME FOR THEM TO GO.

365
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,318
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

366
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,944
>> BYE.

367
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,320
>> I LOVE YOU, BABE.

368
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:11,035
>> I LOVE YOU.

369
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,955
>> Jeff: DEVENS, LAUREN,
VICTORIA, AURORA, GOT NOTHING

370
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,664
FOR YOU.

371
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,206
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

372
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,833
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

373
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,043
ENJOY.

374
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,128
>> SEEING SOMEONE AS IMPORTANT
AS MY DAD AND TO HAVE IT TAKEN

375
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,379
AWAY, IT JUST SUCKS.

376
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,675
AND IT ABSOLUTELY MAKES ME THINK
TWICE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND

377
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,011
OF RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH RON,
WHAT KIND OF STRATEGY HE'S

378
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,347
REALLY PLAYING.

379
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,016
IF THERE'S EVER AN AWARD WHERE
PICKING SOMEONE IS CRUCIAL IT'S

380
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,017
THE LOVED ONE'S VISIT.

381
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,144
YOU WHO PICK CAN MAKE OUR BREAK
YOUR GAME.

382
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,363
>> RON, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU.

383
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,364
>> THANK YOU, RON.

384
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,406
>> YEAH, THANK YOU, RON.

385
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,242
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
HONEYMOON.

386
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,202
>> THIS IS LOVELY!

387
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,164
>> WAIT, FIRST OF ALL, HOW WAS
THE TALENT SHOW?

388
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,165
>> AMAZING.

389
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,541
THEY ROCKED IT.

390
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,335
THEY DID GREAT.

391
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,503
>> I'M EATING EVERYTHING.

392
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,754
I'M EATING EVERYTHING.

393
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,216
>> I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK
AND EXPERIENCE THE MARRIED LIFE.

394
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,385
I'M SO EXCITED.

395
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,053
>> YOU ARE SO CLOSE.

396
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,722
LIKE, YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO BE
PROUD OF.

397
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,266
>> RON CAME THROUGH IN THE
CLUTCH, AND HE PICKED ME FOR

398
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,059
THIS FAMILY VISIT.

399
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,521
I MEAN, I AM SUPER GRATEFUL TO
HIM.

400
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,065
>> GAVIN HAS TALKED ABOUT YOU
EVERY DAY ALL DAY.

401
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:23,857
>> OH!

402
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,318
>> LUCKILY, CARLY SUPPORTS MY
DREAM.

403
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:31,782
BUT DEEP DOWN, I STILL FEEL LIKE
WHO DOESN'T GO ON THEIR

404
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,577
HONEYMOON BECAUSE OF "SURVIVOR."

405
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,289
CARLY WROTE IN OUR VOW BOOKS,
"PART OF ME IS LEAVING"...

406
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,290
SORRY.

407
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,712
"A PART OF ME IS LEAVING WITH
YOU ON THE PLANE."

408
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:49,258
IT'S LIKE, "YEAH, LIKE, I-- I
HAVE SO MUCH TO PLAY FOR.

409
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,801
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

410
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,429
>> I HAVE PLAYED DOUBLE AGENT
AND DOUBLE-DOUBLE AGENT.

411
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,263
I HAVE LIED.

412
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:54,722
>> I BET.

413
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,682
>> I HAVE CHEATED.

414
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,766
>> IT'S A PART OF THE GAME.

415
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,060
>> I'VE MANIPULATED SO MANY
PEOPLE.

416
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:00,728
>> YOU'RE STILL HERE, RIGHT?

417
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:05,816
>> I'M IN CHARGE OF THIS GAME.

418
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,400
>> RIGHT.

419
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,360
>> BUT THEY'RE SO LOYAL.

420
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,114
I MEAN, PART OF THE GAME IS
PICKING PEOPLE SO THAT THEY

421
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,157
THINK YOU TRUST THEM.

422
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,118
I WANTED TO GET THE MAXIMUM
IMPACT OUT OF MY PICKS.

423
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,078
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE JEWEL
NEMY POCKET.

424
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,663
AND THEN I PICKED GAVIN.

425
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,623
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
HONEYMOON.

426
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,292
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE SUEDE MY
DECISION.

427
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,795
I NEED GAVIN TO BE LOCKED IN,
AND NOW TO GIVE HIM THAT

428
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,172
EXPERIENCE WITH HIS NEW BRIDE,
IT'S A POWERFUL GIFT.

429
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,799
WHAT ARE THE THREE OF US DOING?

430
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,301
>> IF RICK DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY
ATTORNEY GENERAL IT'S RICK.

431
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,928
>> THERE YOU GO.

432
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,847
>> HIS BUTT'S GOT TO GO.

433
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,142
IN THE BEST IN MY LIFE TELLING
LLOYD, "I DID THIS.

434
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,143
I DID THAT."

435
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,228
AND HE KEPT SAYING TO ME, "DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

436
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,646
WIN THIS GAME."

437
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,148
SO IT'S MADE ME FOCUS EVEN MORE.

438
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,983
>> BYE, GUYS!

439
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,484
BYE!

440
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,651
>> WE'RE A GREAT TEAM.

441
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,990
HE BALANCES ME AND HE SUPPORTS
ME AND IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY

442
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:58,994
TOGETHER.

443
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:04,833
>> HE IS TRYING TO MAKE EVERYONE
PARANOID RIGHT NOW.

444
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,960
>> MAYBE SOMEBODY SENT HIM A
CLUE.

445
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,840
>> BUT IF YOU HAD A CLUE, IF YOU
ALREADY HAD IT -- GO THROUGH IT.

446
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,216
GO THROUGH IT.

447
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:22,226
>> ALL RIGHT.

448
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,648
>> ALL RIGHT.

449
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,399
>> WHY ARE YOU LOOKING IN MY
BAG?

450
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,402
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE WALK AROUND
LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

451
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,362
IT'S ALLOWED IN THE GAME.

452
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,322
I JUST CAN'T LOOK--
>> I KNOW IT'S ALLOWED.

453
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:40,702
>> WHAT WAS I JUST SAYING.

454
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,703
>> AUGUST WARD!

455
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,704
>> NOT REALLY.

456
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,207
I'M GOOD.

457
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,585
>> I FEEL LIKE I WOULD FEEL
AWKWARD IF I GOT CAUGHT LOOKING

458
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,419
THROUGH SOMEONE'S BAG.

459
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:55,676
>> NO.

460
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,344
>> THAT'S OKAY.

461
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,723
>> SO I'M OUT SEARCHING FOR THE
IDOL AGAIN, AND I GO BACK TO

462
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:06,562
CAMP, AND I SEE AURORA CLOSING
THE FLAP OF MY BAG, AND SHE'S

463
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,187
BUSTED.

464
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,730
BUT SHE DIDN'T EVEN HIDE IT.

465
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,567
SHE DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT
NOTHING.

466
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,193
>> IT'S NOTHING AGAINST YOU,
RICK.

467
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:13,902
I'M JUST LOOKING.

468
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,238
>> OH, I KNOW.

469
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,197
YOU JUST GOT CAUGHT.

470
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,740
>> I KNOW, AND I'M TOTALLY FINE
WITH IT, DUDE.

471
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,075
>> I KNOW.

472
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:20,659
>> YEAH.

473
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,243
>> I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

474
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,578
FIND ANYTHING GOOD?

475
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:22,953
>> NO.

476
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:23,620
NOT REALLY.

477
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,747
>> YOU DIDN'T LOOK VERY HARD.

478
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,750
THANK GOD AURORA DIDN'T FIND THE
ADVANTAGE RON GAVE ME.

479
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,295
BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT
AWKWARD IN CAMP.

480
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,298
I WANT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW
AURORA'S GOING THROUGH BAGS.

481
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,967
CAN WE TRUST AURORA?

482
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,928
>> YEAH, THEY'RE LOOK THROUGH
BAGS.

483
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,387
WATCH YOUR BAGS.

484
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,762
>> OH, GOD.

485
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,639
>> WHATEVER.

486
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,434
>> MAYBE DON'T KEEP THE ONE I
GAVE YOU IN YOUR BAG.

487
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,937
>> I'M NOT LEAVING MY BAG
ANYMORE.

488
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,771
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

489
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,939
I'M TAKING IT EVERYWHERE.

490
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,984
NOW THAT EVERYONE THINKS I'M
SEARCHING FOR AN IDOL, I'M GOING

491
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,610
TO SEARCH FOR AN IDOL.

492
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,987
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING ALL DAY.

493
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,780
IT'S A PAIN, MAN.

494
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,325
I LOOKED ALL OVER THE PLACE AND
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.

495
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,662
BUT IF THERE'S AN IDOL OUT HERE
FOR ME TO FIND, I'M GOING TO PUT

496
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,788
IN THE WORK.

497
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,292
THIS IS MY SECOND CHANCE,
BECAUSE I CAME BACK FROM "THE

498
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,251
EDGE."

499
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,003
IF I GO FOR IT, THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN'T DO.

500
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,504
OH, MY GOD!

501
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,342
YOU MUST BE KIDDING ME.

502
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,301
"CONGRATULATIONS.

503
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,469
YOU FOUND THE CLUE TO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

504
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,513
IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO BE
DARING.

505
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,600
IT RESTS IN THE TREES ABOVE YOUR
SHELTER.

506
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,936
GOOD LUCK."

507
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:29,728
OH!

508
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,979
I DON'T EVEN NEED IT TO BE A
SECRET.

509
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,066
I'M GOING TO GO GET IT RIGHT
NOW.

510
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,358
NO.

511
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,776
I WON'T.

512
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,320
OH, I WANT IT IN MY POSSESSION
SO BAD.

513
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,863
BUT I DON'T WANT THEM TON I HAVE
IT.

514
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,990
I WANT TO HAVE OPTIONS WITH THIS
BABY.

515
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,368
I MEAN, THIS COULD BE A
MILLION-DOLLAR FIND.

516
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,327
I MIGHT HAVE JUST STUMBLED
ACROSS A MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT

517
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,329
TREE.

518
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,872
I JUST HAVE TO SCOPE IT OUT.

519
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,165
WHERE I THINK IT IS.

520
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,250
HOLY CRAP!

521
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,418
THIS THING IS, LIKE, 15 FEET IN
THE AIR ABOVE CAMP.

00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,625
YOU'RE NOT JUST MESSING WITH ME.

697
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,751
>> YEP.

698
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,628
>> WELL, IT WOULD BE THE SECOND
TIME YOU GUYS SAVED ME.

699
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,130
SO I'D BE TOTALLY ON BOARD.

700
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:35,588
>> OKAY.

701
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,341
>> OKAY, BUDDY.

702
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,968
>> OKAY, YOU GUYS GO THIS WAY.

703
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,594
I'LL GO THAT WAY.

704
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,470
>> YEAH, YEAH.

705
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,513
>> RON!

706
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,973
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

707
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:49,519
>> THERE'S A REASON WHY THE GAME
IS CALLED "SURVIVOR."

708
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:53,022
>> THE PLAN TONIGHT IS TO PUT
ALL THE VOTES ON DEVENS, BUT IF

709
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,902
DEVENS DOES HAVE A REAL IMMUNITY
IDOL, HIS ONE VOTE WOULD CHOOSE

710
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,695
WHO GOES HOME.

711
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,698
SO I TOLD DEVENS TO VOTE FOR
AURORA.

712
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,282
>> WE'RE CLEAR.

713
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,950
WE ARE ALL VOTING RICK.

714
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,995
SHOOS ALL WE NEED TO DO.

715
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,832
>> HERE'S THE DEAL-- AURORA,
SHE'S POSITIONED THOARS WIN THIS

716
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,458
GAME.

717
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,667
>> AURORA'S BURNED NOBODY.

718
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,003
THE THREE OF US HAVE ALL BURNED
PEOPLE IN OUR ORIGINAL TRIBE.

719
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,964
>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE ALL GOOD BEFORE--

720
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,757
>> I'M GOOD.

721
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,967
>> I LOVE YOU TWO.

722
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,012
>> AND I'M SO GLAD US THREE ARE
TOGETHER.

723
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:29,809
>> IT WILL BE A LIVELY TRIBAL
READING OF THE VOTES.

724
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,729
>> THERE'S RICK, AND THEN
THERE'S THE BACKUP PLAN IF RICK

725
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,354
HAS AN IDOL.

726
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,189
>> EXACTLY.

727
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,524
>> TONIGHT'S VOTE SHOULD BE
SIMPLE.

728
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,692
EVEN RICK KNOWS IT'S RICK.

729
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:41,196
THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T KNOW IF
HE HAS SOME KIND OF IDOL OR

730
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,197
ADVANTAGE.

731
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,740
AND AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE TO
ASSUME HE DOES.

732
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,368
IF WE DIDN'T SPLIT THE VOTES,
THEN JUST WHOEVER RICK VOTES FOR

733
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,369
GOES HOME.

734
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,038
BUT I WANT TO BE THE ONE TO
DECIDE WHO GOES HOME.

735
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,708
>> IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS WE
HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE SAME SIDE

736
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:54,542
MOST OF THIS GAME.

737
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,084
I'D RATHER BE ON THE SAME SIDE.

738
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,338
>> I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

739
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,049
IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT NOW
WHERE I NEED SOMEONE THAT I CAN

740
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:01,966
TRUST.

741
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,844
IN MY HEAD, "THIS IS WHAT MAKES
MOST SENSE.

742
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,678
AND YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

743
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,095
>> YEAH.

744
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:06,387
>> DEVENS FIRST.

745
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,472
>> YEAH.

746
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:12,060
>> OR IF DEVENS PLAYS AN IDOL,
WE COULD GET OUT RON.

747
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,521
>> I WANT RON OUT SO BADLY.

748
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,898
>> IF GAVIN KNOWS ME AND YOU ARE
ON BOARD, I THINK HE'LL BE MORE

749
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,692
THAN DOWN.

750
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:24,155
RON PICKING GAVIN AND JULIE FOR
THE LOVED ONES MADE IT VERY

751
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,574
CLEAR HE'S NOT WORKING WITH ME.

752
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,910
SO HE'S GOING TO GET STUCK ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE NUMBERS

753
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,078
WHICH I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH.

754
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:34,707
>> THERE'S SIX OF US VOTING
DEVENS, BUT WE'RE SAYING JUST IN

755
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:39,921
CASE DEVENS PLAYS SOMETHING,
LAUREN AND GAVIN ARE PICK RON.

756
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,465
>> I HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE.

757
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,425
THIS IS THE LAST TIME I CAN USE
IT.

758
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:50,932
BUT IF YOU 100%, I WOULD GIVE
GAVIN THE EXTRA VOTE.

759
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,602
IF THERE'S A TIE AND I'M THE ONE
THEY VOTE AFTER, I LOSE MY

760
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,853
ABILITY TO VOTE.

761
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,065
IF THERE'S A TIE WHERE I AM ONE
OF THE NAMES BEING WRITTEN DOWN,

762
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,441
I CAN'T REVOTE.

763
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,653
SO THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT
MY ADDITIONAL VOTE WILL COUNT IS

764
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,240
TO GIVE IT TO GAVIN BECAUSE WITH
GAVIN HAVING IMMUNITY, HE'S THE

765
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:11,953
ONE PERSON WHO IS GUARANTEED TO
BE ABLE TO VOTE IN A REVOTE.

766
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,997
WHICH ALLOWS US TO STAY IN
CONTROL.

767
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,624
BUT I'M PUTTING A LOT OF FAITH
IN GAVIN.

768
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:22,088
I JUST HOPE I DON'T GO DOWN IN
HISTORY AS ONE OF THE "SURVIVOR"

769
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,842
IDIOTS.

770
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,137
>> I HAD A VERY, VERY LONG TALK
WITH VICTORIA AND AURORA TODAY.

771
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,267
THEY WANT TO SPLIT THE VOTE
BETWEEN RICK AND RON.

772
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,936
IN CASE, LIKE, RICK PLAYS
SOMETHING.

773
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,854
>> YEAH.

774
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,773
>> WHICH, HONESTLY, GAVIN, IS
FINE WITH ME.

775
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,649
>> YEAH.

776
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,818
>> BECAUSE WE NEED RON OUT,
ANYWAY.

777
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:47,405
>> THE PLAN FOR TONIGHT IS
THERE'S GOING TO BE A MAJORITY

778
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,325
VOTING FOR RICK DEVENS, AND THEN
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO

779
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:55,163
BE THE NEXT BIGGEST THREAT, JUST
IN CASE DEVENS PULLS OUT AN

780
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,414
IDOL.

781
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,541
AND THEY'RE SAYING IT'S GOT TO
BE RON, BUT RON JUST GAVE ME ONE

782
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,168
OF THE GREATEST DAYS OF MY LIFE
YESTERDAY, AND NOW I'M SUPPOSED

783
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:07,508
TO TURN AROUND AND BLINDSIDE
HIM.

784
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,804
>> OKAY, SO HERE'S WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

785
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,014
I'M GIVING YOU MY EXTRA VOTE.

786
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,017
>> AURORA HAS AN EXTRA VOTE, AND
SHE IS GIVING IT TO ME.

787
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,936
SINCE I HAVE IMMUNITY, THEN IF
THERE'S A TIE VOTE, I'M

788
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,396
GUARANTEED TO VOTE AGAIN.

789
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,691
I'M NOT SURE IF I WANT TO VOTE
FOR RON AND BURN BRIDGES BEFORE

790
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,859
I HAVE TO.

791
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,862
I KNOW THAT RON AND JULIE WANT
AURORA TO BE THE BACKUP PLAN,

792
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,865
BUT THAT COULD POSSIBLY DAMAGE
THE RELATIONSHIPS I'VE MADE WITH

793
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:31,449
LAUREN AND VICTORIA.

794
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,408
IT'S A TRICKY SITUATION.

795
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:40,083
I MEAN, IT'S ALMOST LIKE A
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

796
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:44,212
>> FOR ME, TONIGHT'S TRIBAL IS
ABOUT FIGURING OUT IF RON IS

797
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,380
REALLY WITH ME.

798
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,050
SO THE PLAN IS TO USE WHAT RON
GAVE ME, WHICH HE SAYS IS A

799
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:55,264
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AND VOTE
AURORA OUT.

800
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,224
DUN-DUN-DUN-DUH.

801
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,768
REDEMPTION FOR RON OR A VILLAIN
IN OUR MIDST?

802
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,727
TRIBAL WILL TELL.

803
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,230
AND AN IDOL READY TO BE PLAYED.

804
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,233
WHO WILL BENEFIT, AND WHO WILL
GO HOME?

805
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,526
STAY TUNED FOR THE DETAILS.

806
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,902
I'M RICK DEVENS.

807
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:11,030
AND THAT'S OUR TOP STORY AT VATA
BEACH.

>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

810
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:38,099
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

811
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,936
SO, DEVENS, TODAY AT THE
CHALLENGE, YOU WERE OUT EARLY,

812
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,271
YOU SAT DOWN AND SAID, "IT'S ME
TONIGHT."

813
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,355
DO YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY?

814
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,606
>> ABSOLUTELY.

815
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,026
NEVER A GOOD SIGN WHEN THERE'S A
SHELTER FULL OF PEOPLE AND ONE

816
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,154
OF THEM IS GOING THROUGH YOUR
BAG.

817
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,280
NOT A GREAT FEELING, JEFF.

818
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,239
>> Jeff: WHO GOT CAUGHT?

819
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,116
>> AURORA, RED HANDED.

820
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,200
>> WOW.

821
00:33:56,284 --> 00:34:00,163
>> DEVENS MADE VERY CLEAR HE WAS
LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

822
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,165
SO, HE LEFT HIS BAG.

823
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,082
I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH IT.

824
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,168
>> AND I CAN END THE SPECULATION
RIGHT NOW.

825
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,294
BUT I WON'T.

826
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,797
I'M ENJOYING MYSELF.

827
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,506
<i>( LAUGHTER ).</i>

828
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,674
>> JEFF, TO ME IT'S JUST WORDS.

829
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,802
AND WORDS IS NOT VIABLE IN THIS
GAME.

830
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,848
THAT'S WHY EVERYONE HAS MULTIPLE
OPTIONS, BACKUPS, AND BACKUPS

831
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,016
FOR THEIR BACKUP.

832
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,309
>> Jeff: VICTORIA, WHAT'S YOUR
TAKE ON THIS?

833
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,270
>> IF ANYONE HAD AN IDOL, IT
WOULD BE DEVENS.

834
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,314
HE'S PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT
ADVANTAGES IN THIS GAME, AND YOU

835
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,317
JUST ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN
"B" AT THE VERY LEAST.

836
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,361
>> Jeff: RON, ARE THERE SO
MANY PLANS IN PLACE THAT IT'S A

837
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,197
LITTLE LIKE SPINNING THE
ROULETTE WHEEL?

838
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,283
>> NO, IT'S NOT THAT RANDOM.

839
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,328
NO LONGER ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
WHO YOU VOTE FOR TODAY, THEN

840
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,664
WHEN YOU GO BACK TO CAMP, YOU
WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHO

841
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,335
WILL I BE WORKING WITH AND
WHAT'S NIGH NEXT VOTE?

842
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,212
>> Jeff: SO, ARE YOU WORRIED
TONIGHT LEGITIMATELY.

843
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,006
>> I DIDN'T HEAR MY NAME TODAY.

844
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:54,717
NOBODY SAID IT TO MY FACE.

845
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,635
MAYBE BEHIND MY BACK.

846
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,178
I HOPE I HAVE A HANDLE ON WHAT'S
HAPPENING?

847
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,723
>> Jeff: RON, WALK ME THROUGH
THE LOVED ONE CHALLENGE.

848
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,016
YOU WIN THE CHALLENGE.

849
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,560
YOU CHOOSE GAFFE AND I KNOW
JULIE TO BRING ALONG.

850
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,021
WHAT IT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU
AFTER THE LOVE WAS OVER, AND YOU

851
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,607
HAVE OTHER PEOPLE BACK AT CAMP
THAT YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE?

852
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,359
>> I WAS HEARTBROKEN FOR
VICTORIA AND LAUREN BECAUSE IT

853
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:15,655
WAS THEIR DADS, AND THERE'S A
SPECIAL BOND BETWEEN A FATHER

854
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,864
AND A DAUGHTER.

855
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,325
AND TO HAVE THEM NOT GET TO HAVE
MORE TIME TO EXPERIENCE THIS

856
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,577
WITH THEM, IT WAS VERY HARD FOR
ME.

857
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,081
>> Jeff: LAUREN, THAT REWARD
IS VALUED BY EVERYBODY.

858
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,167
BUT ONLY SOME GET IT AND OTHERS
DON'T.

859
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:32,004
HUE BIG OF AN IMPACT DOES THAT
HAVE IN THIS GAME?

860
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,215
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT HE
CHOSE WERE VERY TELLING.

861
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,261
THE PEOPLE THAT HE LEFT BEHIND
WAS VERY CONTINGENT.

862
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,470
IT TOTALLY HAD AN IMPACT ON THE
GAME.

863
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,223
>> Jeff: GAVIN, IS THERE ANY
PART OF YOU ON THE RECEIVING END

864
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,225
THAT THINKS THIS COULD BE A
DISADVANTAGE TO ME, AND ALL I

865
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,476
DID WAS GET SELECTED.

866
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,730
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IT COULD BE A
DISADVANTAGE, BUT I WAS THANKFUL

867
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,608
THAT RON CHOSE ME, AND HOPEFULLY
NO ONE HELD THAT AGAINST ME.

868
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,069
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK
IN THIS GAME.

869
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,613
>> Jeff: JULIE, I'M ALWAYS
TRYING TO FIND WHERE THE RHYTHM

870
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,865
IS.

871
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,367
AND THIS SEASON, TO ME, HAS FELT
LIKE A PIN BALL MACHINE WHERE

872
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,078
THE FLIPPERS ARE GOING, THE
BALL'S GOING EVERYWHERE, AND YOU

873
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,873
NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO
COME BACK DOWN OR POP BACK UP.

874
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,584
>> I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A REALLY
GOOD ANALOGY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

875
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,711
IN MULTIPLE ALLIANCES AT THIS
POINT.

876
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,714
I FEEL LIKE WE'VE ALL BUILT
RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVERY SINGLE

877
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,923
PERSON THAT IS SITTING UP HERE.

878
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,218
AND THINGS COULD STILL PIN BALL
BACK AND FORTH ANY TIME IN THE

879
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,344
GAME.

880
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,598
>> Jeff: DEVENS, THAT IS
HOPEFUL WHEN YOU HEAR JULIE SAY,

881
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,390
"I'VE HAD MULTIPLE ALLIANCES."

882
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,600
>> YEAH.

883
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,393
>> Jeff: THAT MEANS THERE ARE
RELATIONSHIPS SCATTERED AMONGST

884
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,936
THE SEVEN YOU.

885
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,979
>> ABSOLUTELY.

886
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,899
AND I'M TRYING TO FIND THE
CRACKS IN THERE, BUT,

887
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,358
APPARENTLY, EVERYONE KNOWS
SOMETHING I DON'T.

888
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,736
PEOPLE ARE NOT HAVING STRATEGIC
TALKS WITH ME.

889
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,446
MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE
DIFFERENT.

890
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,282
>> Jeff: YOU CAN COMPARE THIS
TO ANYTHING YOU DO BACK HOME?

891
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,285
>> WELL, THIS PART OF THE GAME
BACK HOME, IF I WAS LIVE OUT IN

892
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,414
THE FIELD AND THEY SAID, "WE'RE
GOING TO GO TO RICK DEVENS RIGHT

893
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,081
NOW."

894
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,291
AND I SAID, "I'M RIGHT HERE."

895
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,585
"OKAY, THANKS, RICK.

896
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,294
WE'RE GOOD WITH YOU.

897
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,296
NOW ON TO THE REST OF PROGRAM."

898
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,798
>> I WAS WILLING TO TALK TO
DEVENS.

899
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,382
I HEARD HIM OUT.

900
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,467
IT WASN'T A CLOSED DOOR.

901
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,177
I'M SORRY IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

902
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,553
>> NO, YOU HEARD ME, YEAH.

903
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,473
>> I THINK DEVENS HIT THE NAIL
ON THE HEAD WHEN HE SAID THAT

904
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,975
PEOPLE MUST KNOW SOMETHING HE
DOESN'T.

905
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,311
I'M SURE OTHER PEOPLE KNOW
THINGS I DON'T AS WELL.

906
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,522
BUT FOR ME, MAKING IT TO THE
FINAL THREE, I PERSONALLY DON'T

907
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,441
WANT TO SIT NEXT TO DEVENS.

908
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,360
>> Jeff: DEVENS, HARD TO HEAR
THAT?

909
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,527
>> NO.

910
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,906
I MEAN, EVENTUALLY, THEY'RE
GOING TO REALIZE, OH, MY FINAL

911
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:22,782
THREE DIDN'T PAN OUT.

912
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,659
I WISH I HAD AN EXTRA VOTE RIGHT
NOW.

913
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,079
AND THAT'S AG WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO AT LEAST THREE OF

914
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,163
THESE PEOPLE.

915
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:32,875
>> Jeff: GAVIN, WHAT DEVENS
SAID IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

916
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,001
SOME OF ARE YOU WRONG.

917
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,712
>> I MEAN, I AGREE WITH HIM
100%, BUT YOU HAVE TO FEEL

918
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,880
CONFIDENT IN YOURSELF.

919
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,883
I'M SURE THE OTHER SIX OF US
THINK WE HAVE THE RIGHT PLAN.

920
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,594
IT'S A MATTER OF WHO IS TRUSTING
THEIR GUT, AND WHO HAS REALLY

921
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,055
BUILT THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET
THEM TO THE NEXT STAGE OF THE

922
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,057
GAME.

923
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,518
>> Jeff: OKAY, IT IS TIME TO
VOTE.

924
00:37:50,601 --> 00:38:00,611
JULIE, YOU'RE UP.

925
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:07,076
JULIE, YOU'RE UP.

926
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,374

AT LEAST THERE'S BEEN A LINE

927
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:23,467
DRAWN IN THE SAND.

928
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:30,141

YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE ME LOOK
