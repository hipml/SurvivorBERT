174
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,206
but if I'm trying
to get closer to Jake,

175
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,827
and he's a lawyer, then
I'm gonna, you know, pretend

176
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,689
to be, you know,
interested in that stuff.

177
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:15,206
I hope you know people
appreciate that kind of work.

178
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,758
JAKE:
Thanks.

179
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:18,551
-Can I join y'all?
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

180
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,241
But there's
a lot of people, like,

181
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:23,310
who, like, really remind me of
you, Katurah, that I work with.

182
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:24,586
-Really?
-Yes.

183
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,103
KATURAH:
I thought about being a lawyer,

184
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,931
kind of helping
in that way, but...

185
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,689
I'm really kind of
playing it up, but I am

186
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:33,586
genuinely enjoying the moment,

187
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,689
because it's allowing us
all to bond.

188
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:37,034
You hear so many people
who are like,

189
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:38,448
"Oh, I don't think I can do it,"

190
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,482
when it's, like, dude,
like, I did it. Like...

191
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:44,344
I graduated high school
with, like, a 2.6, I think.

192
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:46,000
-KATURAH: Really?
-Yeah.

193
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:48,241
KATURAH:
But also, talking
to Jake and Julie,

194
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,931
it really got me thinking.
And I'm like,

195
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:52,137
okay, I'm at day 20,

196
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:54,275
and I don't
want to leave this game--

197
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,206
'cause you never know when
you might have to leave it--

198
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,034
without having told my story.

199
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:00,206
I actually had a little bit

200
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,517
of the opposite
experience, 'cause

201
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,413
my family took me out of school

202
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:08,000
after my fifth grade graduation.

203
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,068
-And so...
-Why did they do that?

204
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:11,689
Religion.

205
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:13,827
-JAKE: What? Religion?
-Religion.

206
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,689
They-they joined
a religion that said

207
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:18,482
kids should be homeschooled
and not in public school.

208
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:21,689
But, you know,
a few weeks in, it was,

209
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:26,103
"Mom's going back to work
and figure it out," you know?

210
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:29,655
When I was a child,
my family joined

211
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:32,517
a quite extreme religious cult.

212
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,344
And it just, like, instantly,

213
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,931
my childhood
got taken away from me.

214
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:39,275
And so, you know,
they started putting me to work.

215
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,965
And I worked, like,
three, four jobs.

216
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,655
[crying]: You know, nobody said,
"Let me think about Katurah.

217
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:46,862
"Like, what does
it mean that this child

218
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:49,689
is not in school for years?"
Years.

219
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,310
And then when I was 13,

220
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:55,724
they told me
the leader decided that,

221
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:59,172
you know, you're gonna
be his next wife. And

222
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:02,862
that's when my mom-- I think
something in her clicked,

223
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:06,724
and we put all of our belongings
in, like, two trash bags.

224
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,655
[breathes sharply]

225
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:11,724
[crying]: And just ran away
in the middle of the night.

00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:13,482
[sniffles]

227
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:16,379
When we finally
left that religion and, like,

228
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:18,586
-joined the real world again,
you know, it was, like...
-Yeah.

229
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,517
KATURAH:
I was 14.

230
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,482
So they just put me in
high school because of my age.

231
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:27,620
-And so I was just so afraid
that I would be the dumb one.
-JULIE: Yeah.

232
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,517
I'm gonna be the stupid one.
I don't have...

233
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,931
-Never having
been to school in years.
-Yeah.

234
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:35,931
KATURAH:
I just got, you know, shuffled
back into the world again.

235
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:40,620
[exhales] And then I realized
I was Black and I was poor

236
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:43,000
and I was a woman
and I was gay.

237
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,931
And that is when,

238
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:47,241
at, like, 14, I said,

239
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:49,586
"I'm gonna become a lawyer

240
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,620
who advocates for Black people."

241
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:55,241

that I literally can say here,

00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:58,655

00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,172
But now she thinks
it's her idol.

342
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:15,689
She's hanging on to it greedily,
like Gollum to the Ring.

343
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:17,862
And that's a scary thought.

344
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:19,275
Well, whatever you decide,

345
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,931
I mean, it's your...
you got the idol.

346
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:22,172
Y'all got one, too.

347
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:25,172
-Austin's got another one.
-Yeah.

348
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,034
My gut right now is that
all four Reba members

349
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:30,241
want to go final four together.

350
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,758
But if one of them
wants to distinguish themselves

351
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,068
and make a big move,

352
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:37,793
it's Drew.

353
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,310
He's acting so suspicious.

354
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,862
I'm thinking, "Boy,

355
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,586
is now the time that people
are gonna start taking shots?"

356
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:47,206
He asked me if I need... wanted

357
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,620
to make any big moves
with my idol.

358
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:55,448
If I'm planning
on doing something?

359
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,758
-Yeah.
-I know.

360
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:58,724
If they did want
to pull a move on us,

361
00:16:58,827 --> 00:16:59,931
like, we have the idol,

362
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,586
and then we know
so much information, too.

363
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,827
Yep.

364
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,205
DEE:
After Tribal Council,

365
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,241
we got together, the four of us,
and we made a pact

366
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:08,205
that it's gonna be
the four of us strong.

367
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,034
Drew, Austin, Julie and I--
we still need each other

368
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:12,896
because there's still
six days left in the game,

369
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,827
and we don't know
what Jeff is gonna throw at us.

370
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,103
The thing is that
it's important to stay four,

371
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:18,758
because we still
have the numbers.

372
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:19,896
I know.

373
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,448
And once this four is done,

374
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,964
-they're coming for us,
one by one.
-Yep.

375
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:26,448
DEE:
But I feel like
there's a crack in Drew,

376
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,792
and that kind of scares me,

377
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:29,482
because I know
how close he is to Emily.

378
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:32,931
Look, I really think
that when she gets back,

379
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,379
-she's gonna lie to everybody.
-I know.

380
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:38,586
We can all put it in people's
head that she can be dangerous.

381
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,103
-Right.
-Yeah, we can.

382
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:43,344
So, right now,
I'm looking at Emily next.

383
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,379
However, on these journeys,

384
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,000
there's usually opportunities
for an advantage, an idol.

385
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,482
Anything can happen.

386
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:52,137
Yeah, I'm very curious
to see what she comes back with.

387
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,862
♪ ♪

388
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:02,137
EMILY:
If somebody is gonna go on
a journey and get an advantage,

389
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,034
I would rather be the person
making that decision.

390
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:07,965
But it's still really scary
because if I thought I already

391
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,482
had a target on my back
after the Bruce blindside,

392
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:13,068
then going off and
taking part in this adventure--

393
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:15,034
that just puts more
of a target on my back.

394
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:19,896
"Trek down the coast to
make your decision. Good luck."

395
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,551
But we're coming into

396
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:23,482
the fourth quarter of Survivor,
which means that

397
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:25,034
this is when the decision

398
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,724
for the winner
ofSurvivor will be made.

399
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:29,206
And I like being
in a position where I have

400
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,344
the opportunity to make
a decision, but I'm conscious

401
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:33,724
of the fact that I could
put what position I've built

402
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:35,275
in a very precarious spot

403
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,034
by making the wrong choice.

404
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:43,586
For the first time
in my Survivor journey,

405
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,344
I have a moment to reflect.

406
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:47,551
And it's funny. I came
into the game ofSurvivor,

407
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:49,620
and I said, "I don't need
to change as a person."

408
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:51,517
I'm usually a very direct
and aggressive person,

409
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,379
and I still, to an extent, am.

410
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:56,103
But at the very first
Tribal Council...

411
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:58,172
I know one of them
was going home

412
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,206
who wanted to be here
more than me.

413
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,344
EMILY:
...it was obvious that my name
was on the chopping block.

414
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,206
You have kind of
isolated yourself.

415
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,724
EMILY:
I was told I'm aggressive
and confrontational.

416
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:09,310
This is an emotional game.
I'm discovering that.

417
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:13,758
So I've changed.
My game has changed in terms of

418
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,000
softness, right,
that I bring to conversations.

419
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:18,275
Now I'm able to have deeper

420
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:19,965
emotional connections
with people,

421
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:22,275
hear about what's important
in their life, and that is

422
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,827
going to extend far outside
the game of Survivor.

423
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,482
Oh, no. Another puzzle.
I like puzzles

424
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,413
when it's a Sunday morning
and I'm drinking a coffee.

425
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:34,689
When I don't like puzzles
is when I'm playing a game

426
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:36,965
for a million dollars
and my vote's on the line

427
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:38,172
and I feel like
I could be going home.

428
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,241
Suddenly, puzzles
are a lot less fun, then.

429
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,586
Wow. That's huge.

430
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,931
There's no guarantee in
Survivor,except for immunity.

431
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:19,000
What is immunity worth? Mm.

432
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:20,724
If you could choose
between having a vote

433
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:22,344
and having immunity,
you pick immunity every time.

434
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:26,310
So having immunity
is extremely appealing to me.

435
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:27,758
But the flip side of that is

436
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:29,655
you'll be safe,
but if you can't do it,

437
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:30,793
you'll lose your vote.

438
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:36,103
I'm imagining that there's
probably conversations

439
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:37,310
back at camp, talking about,

440
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:39,275
"Hey, maybe
we should target Emily."

441
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:41,965
At this stage in the game,
my vote is my life.

442
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:44,965
If I have no vote,
then I'm easy pickings.

443
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:47,482
I'm scared that, while
I might be able to solve this,

444
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:50,965
if I try and fail,
I could be guaranteeing

445
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:52,448
my return home.

446
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,931
And I don't think
it's a trade-off worth it, so...

447
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,137
I can't... I can't participate.

448
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,275
I will be getting on the boat
and returning to camp.

449
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,862
I can't risk my vote.

450
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:04,793
I'm playing the best game
that I know how to play.

451
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,724
I really hope
the decision that I made

452
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:08,862
is the right one and that

453
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:10,034

as probably
the three biggest threats,

481

like Dee's threat level

486
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:44,241
has been going
down a little bit, though.

487
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:47,000
I'd rather go
with whoever the biggest is.

-Okay. Yeah.
-KATURAH: Yeah. Yeah.

489

There's a lot in my mind
right now about my game,

490
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:57,724
and I do feel like this
is the moment that I plan

491
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:00,620
to start picking up steam,
coming out of the shadows,

492
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:04,379
making the bigger moves,
being a little bit bolder.

493
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:07,551
So I think I have options.
But for me,

494
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:08,689
I know that I'd like

495
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:10,137
to blindside Julie first.

496
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,310
How are you feeling
about everything?

497
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:14,413
I mean, have you been
thinking about your final three?

498
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,344
Honestly, I don't have
a thought of, like, who I,

499
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:18,241
-for sure, want to sit by,
-Mm-hmm.

500
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:21,931
-but I have thoughts of,
like, who I don't.
-Who probably don't want to.

501
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,827
-I-I agree. Yeah.
-Like, who would kill the game.

502
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:27,724
So initially,
I was thinking Dee and Mama J.

503
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:28,862
Mm-hmm.

504
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:34,344
-But I think
Mama J. is climbing. Yeah.
-She has excelled. I think...

505
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:36,172
So, basically,
Katurah says to me

506
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:38,931
kind of what I've already
been thinking, which is

507
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,137
"We should not
go to the end with Julie."

508
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:42,862
And I agree with her.

509
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:45,137
-Mama J.'s just been
friends with everybody.
-Yeah.

510
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:46,620
-AUSTIN: Everybody loves her.
-Yeah. Yeah.

511
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,310
AUSTIN:
Everybody trusts her.

512
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:51,551
-Everybody loves her deeply,
and she's sharp.
-Yeah.

513
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:53,103
How do you not love Mama J.?

514
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:55,689
She will be a tough person
to beat at the end.

515
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:56,724
She is someone that,

516
00:23:56,827 --> 00:23:58,000
even if she backstabs you,

517
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,517
she can still win your heart.

518
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,689
So we might have to consider
cutting her off

519
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:04,862
before the final four,
even though that's

520
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:08,068
what we agreed to do-- to bring
the Reba four to the four.

521
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:09,517
I'm definitely open to it.

522
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,310
It is gonna be weird
writing her after all this,

523
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:13,793
-I know. I know.
-but, like, I do understand

524
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,655
that if she's in the end,
we all lose.

525
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,482
-Yeah.
-And, like, that is, at the end
of the day, we need to win.

526
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:22,517
Yeah. I would like
to do Julie and then Emily.

527
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,551
I think Drew

528
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:26,827
might be on board
for either of them, too.

529
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,103
KATURAH:
I honestly think

530
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:29,620
everybody would
be on board with Julie

531
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:30,896
-for this vote, except Dee.
-Okay.

532
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,137
I think

533
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:34,931
if anyone
were to pull the trigger early

534
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:38,482
on this Reba four to the end,
it would most likely be Drew.

535
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:40,551
So I just had a, uh,

536
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:42,241
chat with Katurah.

537
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:44,344
-She wants Julie gone next.
-DREW: What do you think?

538
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:47,827
I just think that would, uh,
absolutely crush Dee.

539
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:51,310
Dee really wants
to do the four to the end.

540
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:53,517
And that puts us
in a difficult spot,

541
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,724
because we don't have
the guaranteed numbers anymore.

542
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:59,241
I would almost rather Emily
and then Julie go.

543
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:01,620
DREW:
Emily and I have
a great working relationship.

544
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:03,103
She's a close ally of mine.

545
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:05,000
So it's got to be Julie.

546
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,068
In my talk with Austin,
I need to

547
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,448
walk him through how
few opportunities we might have

548
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,034
to vote out Julie.

549
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:12,275
I agree.

550
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,344
My concern is that
I think that Emily

551
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:16,551
really is willing to work
with us and genuinely is willing

552
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:19,241
to go final three with us. She's
a much more tractable number

553
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:20,586
and reliable number
than Julie is.

554
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:22,482
-You think she is at this point?
-I do.

555
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:23,896
I want Julie gone next.

556
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,206
AUSTIN:
I'm on board, I think.

557
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,034
I'm just worried about Dee.

558
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:29,482
'Cause then she would...

559
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,344
I don't know if
she'll believe our final three.

560
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,137
I truly think
the best move for me

561
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,068
right now
is to get rid of Julie.

562
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:38,551
The scary thing is, though,
blindsiding Julie

563
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:40,551
would likely
require blindsiding Dee.

564
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:42,448
And that is a thought that

565
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:44,275
really hurts me
and I don't really know

566
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:45,931
how I'll be able to do that.

567
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:48,206
-And then the idol's gone.
-And then the idol's out.

568
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,448
-Um...
-Man, flushing my idol.

569
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,931
-Can't believe I gave her that.
-I know. It's a bummer.

570
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:56,448
-Oh!
-Hey.

571
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:59,551
AUSTIN:
Emily is certainly becoming
a bigger threat, but

572
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:01,413
I have to take out Julie
because

573
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:02,793
she has my idol.

574
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,344
And my idol that I gave to her

575
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:06,689
is stronger
than the amulet I have.

576
00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:08,517
My amulet
has the power of an idol,

577
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,275
but it only lasts

578
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:11,275
until the final six.

579
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:13,551
Julie's idol, which I gave her,

580
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,068
lasts to the final five.

581
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:16,655
-EMILY: So,
the boat picks me up
-DREW: Okay.

582
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,793
and takes me to an island.

583
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:20,379
AUSTIN:
I don't want to ask for it back.

584
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:22,896
That could set the alarm bells
ringing in her head.

585
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,103
So I need to vote her out

586
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:27,965
and flush my own friggin' idol
out of this game.

587
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:31,172
The sign says, "You can choose
to participate in this puzzle.

588
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:32,551
"If you solve the puzzle,

589
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:33,965
"you win safety
at the next Tribal Council.

590
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:36,206
"And if you don't
solve the puzzle,

591
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,655
-then you lose your vote
at the next Tribal Council."

592

-Oh, my God.
-JULIE: Wow.

593
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:42,758
And I chose not to complete it,

594
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:45,310
because I was not confident
in my ability to solve it...

595
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,241
DREW:
I think it's the right call.

596
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,137
DEE: I don't buy that
Emily just played it safe

597
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,517
and came back with nothing.

598
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,896
I don't buy it.
It's just the easy story to say.

599
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,034
We were all worried
the decision would involve us.

600
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:58,034
So this not, uh, not bad news.

601
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:00,482
Yeah.

602
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,689
EMILY: So I come back
and I decide to be

603
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:04,275
the best part about myself,
which is open,

604
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:06,413
honest and transparent.
I tell them

605
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:07,482
exactly what happened.

606
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,000
By being genuine in my story,

607
00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:10,413
telling them the complete
and honest truth,

608
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:11,793
I'm hoping that it will

609
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,413
remove some of the target

610
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:15,793
that was put on me by the fact
that I went on this journey.

611
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:17,068
AUSTIN:
Well, thanks for telling us.

612
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:18,103
-DREW: Yeah. Appreciate it.
-JAKE: Yeah.

613
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:19,413
-DREW: No, no, no, yeah.
-Really.

614
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:20,655
But I need

615
00:27:20,758 --> 00:27:22,000
to circle around
with my closer alliance

616
00:27:22,103 --> 00:27:23,517
and Drew and Austin

617
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,931
and find out what happened
while I was gone.

618
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:27,758
Okay. Well...

619
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:31,275
-Yeah.
-But we want Julie out.

620
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:34,000
-Okay. Okay.
-Austin and I talked about it.

621
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,896
I-I think I want Julie,
but it has to be a blindside.

622
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,034
I agree.

623
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:38,241
EMILY: It's no fun

624
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:39,517
to go away
and then find out that,

625
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,310
in the few hours you were gone,

626
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:42,689
that you're in trouble.

627
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:44,310
But that's
the game ofSurvivor.

628
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,137
And with that in mind,
I need to target the person

629
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:48,551
who is reportedly targeting me,
which is Julie.

630
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:53,827
I think we're headed into
a Julie and Emily showdown.

631
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:55,413
We're both gonna
have smiles on our faces,

632
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,310
but we're both
rallying the troops right now.

633
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:06,517
[quietly]: Stop.

634
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,655
Uh, yeah.

635
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:10,758
My hope is that the alliances

636
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:12,689
that I've built up
will defend me enough

637
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:13,931
that she's the one
who goes home instead.

638
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,034
KATURAH:
So...

639
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:18,241

640
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,137
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I have.

641
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,724
EMILY:
I feel like I've grown a lot

642
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,275
as a player and as a strategist
in the game of Survivor,

643
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,103
but it's scary.
It might be my last

644
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,206
Tribal Council
and I might discover,

645
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,310
in that moment,
that the alliance I had built

646
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:33,586
and had been
making my game decisions on

647
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,965
never really had my back.
It was a fake alliance.

648
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:38,586
Dee has said
she'll never write Julie's name.

649

-I don't think we can tell Dee.

to the very bitter end.

00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:41,344
-It is right on the other side!
Drew wins
-Yes!

850
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:43,206
-Yes! Let's go!
-individual immunity.

851
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,275
-Whew.
-EMILY: Good job, Drew.
-KATURAH: Congrats, Drew.

852
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:46,379
Way to go, Drew.

853
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:48,310
-[grunts]
-PROBST: Nice finish.

854
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,586
Drew is safe. Guaranteed a spot
in the final six.

855
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:52,241
JULIE:
Good job, Drew!

856
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:56,000
PROBST:
Huge victory on day 21.

857
00:37:56,103 --> 00:37:58,586
Oh, my gosh.

858
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:04,551
Drew, come on over.

859
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:06,103
-Great job.
-Nice.

860
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:08,379
Yeah, Drew!

861
00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:10,724
DEE:
Tallest one, even.

862
00:38:10,827 --> 00:38:12,724
JAKE:
Yeah, it was.
Yeah, it was. Yeah.

863
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:16,206
Individual immunity is yours,
safe tonight at Tribal Council.

864
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,206
-Guaranteed a spot in the final.
-Yeah!

865
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,862
-JAKE: Way to go, buddy.
-[whooping]

866
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,241
PROBST:
You're getting a lot of love

867
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,068
-from your competitors.
-I am. I am.

868
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:27,000
What is that about? Because this
is a game for a million dollars.

869
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:29,034
Listen, I mean, I'll say it.
No one else will.

870
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:32,275
I-I... I'm kind of a goober
around camp, and so, the idea

871
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:33,862
that I could be winning an
immunity necklace is unheard of.

872
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:35,758
Probably to them,
but certainly to me.

873
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:37,793
Austin, you had a shot at it.

874
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:40,275
Did you not hear me
saying "both sides"?

875
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:41,965
I heard you.
I just couldn't register.

876
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:43,862
You're in the heat
of the moment. You're like,

877
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:45,758
"Oh, my gosh, I must have
spelled something wrong."

878
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,206
You know, I missed it,
so I'm-I'm with everyone else.

879
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,827
All right, Drew, you are safe.

880
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,241
You are also the recipient
of a nice reward.

881
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:53,758
-Yeah.
-KATURAH: Yeah.

882
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:57,379
Back at camp,
do-it-yourself barbecue.

883
00:38:57,482 --> 00:39:01,551
Invite one person
to join you and tell us why.

884
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:03,758
So, uh, coming out here,
Jake and I had been the longest

885
00:39:03,862 --> 00:39:06,586
since we had a reward.
Uh, I'm gonna choose Jake.

886
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:08,068
-Thanks, man.
-PROBST: Come on over, Jake.
-[applause]

887
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:10,034
Thanks, man.

888
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:11,586
Dude, I appreciate it.
Can I give you a hug, brother?

889
00:39:11,689 --> 00:39:13,241
-Yeah, of course.
-Thank you. Thanks.
That's huge, man.

890
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:15,655
-Aw.
-[Dee laughs]

891
00:39:15,758 --> 00:39:18,000
-[Jake laughs]
-All right,
pick one more person.

892
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,241
-[cheering]
-Yeah.
-Guys Night 2.0.

893
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,275
Beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep.

894
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:24,827
-Don't knock me over.
-[laughing]: Yeah.

895
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:26,586
Ah!

896
00:39:26,689 --> 00:39:28,379
PROBST:
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

897
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:31,310
Everybody's going back to camp,
but Drew, Jake, Austin--

898
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,034
you're gonna have your own
barbecue.

899
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,137
Burgers, hot dogs,
all the fixings.
-Ooh.

900
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:39,206
PROBST:
Katurah, Dee, Emily, Julie,
got nothing for you.

901
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,758
Grab your stuff, head back
to camp. Enjoy the afternoon.

902
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:42,206
-Thank you.
-Good job, boys.
-AUSTIN: Thank you all.

903
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,206
-Good job, guys.
-Congrats.
-Hey, thanks, man.

904
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:47,827
DEE:
What I'm nervous about
is the fact

905
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:50,862
that pre-challenge,
we all had a pact

906
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:53,862
that it would be Emily who would
be the next person to go home.

907
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:57,827
But is that changing up
after the boys getting together?

908
00:39:57,931 --> 00:40:00,172
Because I know that
they're gonna talk strategy.

909
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,551
You know, all of our names
are gonna be in their mouths.

910
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:11,896
♪ ♪

911
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:15,965
JULIE:
So Drew wins today's challenge,

912
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:18,551
and he picks the boys--
Jake and Austin.

913
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:21,310
It feels like the right choice.

914
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,344
The boys are all starving

915
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:26,758
and the last reward,
Emily took all women.

916
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:28,862
So the boys get to peel off

917
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:32,655
to go do their barbecue
and the girls have a spa day.

918
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:35,620
KATURAH:
I mean, where is our sun?!

919
00:40:36,655 --> 00:40:37,931
-EMILY: Oh.
-KATURAH: It was just blazing

920
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:39,689
-a second ago.
-EMILY: I know.

921
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:42,000
DEE:
It's kind of nice that
there's not a lot of waves.

922
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:45,137
Yeah, and it's not crazy.

923
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,758
EMILY:
This tide's low right now,
so it's kind of hard to wash,

924
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,724
but easier than if there were
waves smashing at us.

925
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:49,965
Yeah.

926
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:51,379
It's awkward

927
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,379
to go back to camp
with just the women because

928
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:57,413
we don't have anything to really
talk about, strategy-wise.

929
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,482
Half of us are plotting
against Emily,

930
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:00,965
the other half are plotting
against Julie.

931
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:04,413
And so, the four of us together
are kind of, like,

932
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:06,275
"I guess
we'll talk about our Buffs."

933
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:09,655
"Buffs is a registered trademark
proper of Original Buff."

934
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,103
[laughing]

935
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:13,655
-Oh, like, a Buff is just...
-Made in Spain.

936
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:15,448
-KATURAH: Oh.
-Whoa.
-JULIE: Mm.

937
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,862
Made in Spain.

938
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:20,137
KATURAH:
So, you know, we play along,

939
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:21,655
and somebody throws out
Jake's name,

940
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:23,965
because that's just the easy,
safe route.

941
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:26,551
So who are we taking on next,
then? Which boy is...

942
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:29,000
DEE:
Yeah, he is an easy target.

943
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:30,241
-KATURAH: Yeah.
-DEE: I know.

944
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:32,103
EMILY:
Julie is smiling at me.

945
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:33,931
I'm smiling at her, and

946
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,793
we're pretending like
everything's perfectly fine.

947
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:37,206
But the fact is,

948
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,137
I'm pretty sure
every single person at camp

949
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:41,413
has been approached
by either Julie or myself

950
00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:43,448
to vote the other one out.

951
00:41:45,551 --> 00:41:47,206
JULIE: I know.

952
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,241
AUSTIN:
This is incredible.

953
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:53,000
This is an amazing reward.

954
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:54,620
AUSTIN:
This is absolutely incredible.

955
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,517
DREW: I win the challenge,
and so, obviously,

956
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,344
the immunity's great--
I-I'm not complaining--

957
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:03,379
but I get the chance
to go on a reward.

958
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:05,896
And that reward
is so key because

959
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,103
I do need to have an important
strategy talk with Jake.

960
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:10,172
No, man. This is unreal.

961
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:12,275
This should keep you all
for the rest of the game.

962
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,275
Up to this point,
I've been critical of Jake.

963
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:15,896
I've dished on Jake.

964
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,517
I... We even got in an argument
the other day.

965
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,137
But at the same time,

966
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,758
he's a free agent,
he's got nobody in the game.

967
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:24,068
And so it really is important
to take the leap of faith

968
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,206
and to bestow some kind
of strategic trust

969
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,448
in Jake, just to get
on the same page,

970
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:30,448
and to build a relationship

971
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:32,448
which could be valuable
come a final six.

972
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,896
-So, let's talk strategy.
-Absolutely.

973
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,517
DREW:
Where's your head at, Jake?
'Cause I feel like

974
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,103
seven is a big time
to make a move.

975
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:40,241
Yeah.

976
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:41,758
I hear Emily, Dee, and Julie
as the targets.

977
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:43,965
-Yeah. I'd rather not do Emily.
-DREW: Okay.

978
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:47,275
-AUSTIN:
Yeah, me, too, actually.
-JAKE: Okay.

979
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:48,724
What do we think's
the smartest thing to do?

980
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:51,517
Like, who do we think is
more likely to win immunity?

981
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,137
Julie has a better chance

982
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,620
-DREW: I agree.
-at the end.

983
00:42:54,724 --> 00:42:56,241
Yeah, I'm just concerned
about final four fire-making,

984
00:42:56,344 --> 00:42:57,724
and I think
Julie's more likely to win it.

985
00:42:57,827 --> 00:42:59,413
I agree.

986
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:01,896
JAKE: Prior to this reward,
I have been a backup plan

987
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,344
to Drew and Austin, but

988
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,034
numbers are dwindling,

989
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:08,896
so I do think they need my vote
now more than before.

990
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,413
I don't trust 'em for long,

991
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:12,413
but I do believe
they need me for this round.

992
00:43:12,517 --> 00:43:14,482
Okay, who are we gonna pull in
for this one?

993
00:43:14,586 --> 00:43:16,689
Emily or Katurah?

994
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:19,724
-I think, uh,
both would be game.
-Yeah.

995
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:21,551
I do my job as an attorney,

996
00:43:21,655 --> 00:43:24,827
but I also teach theater
to kids, and,

997
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:26,896
as an actor, I felt like

998
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,137
the past couple votes,
I've been kind of an extra.

999
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:30,689
I've been playing the tree.

1000
00:43:30,793 --> 00:43:33,103
I've been doing a very good job
at playing a tree,

1001
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:34,517
but, to be honest with you,

1002
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,413
I'm sick of playing
a ... damn tree.

1003
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:38,689
So, now,
I think with this vote,

1004
00:43:38,793 --> 00:43:40,758
I'm more, you know,
more of a supporting role,

1005
00:43:40,862 --> 00:43:42,896
and as long as I'm moving up,

1006
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,310
I'm going in the
right direction, I'll take it.

1007
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:48,103
I am.

1008
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:51,655
AUSTIN: I think...

1009
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:53,896
DREW:
Right now, everyone is committed
to vote Julie out.

1010
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,344
The tough one in
this blindside is Dee, because

1011
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:59,000
Dee and Julie are really close.

1012
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,000
So, we have to keep Dee
out of the loop.

1013
00:44:02,103 --> 00:44:03,724
Who's ready
to play some Survivor?

1014
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:05,931
AUSTIN:
I mean, it's time
to do this, man.

1015
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,931
DREW:
If Julie found out
about this plan,

1016
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:09,689
the fear is that
she could wig out.

1017
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:11,172
She would play her idol

1018
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:12,793
and she could take a shot
at anyone.

1019
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:14,379
And that would be a disaster.

1020
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:16,448
You know, 'cause who knows
where the vote could come down?

1021
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:18,586
Look who it is.

1022
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,000
-Hi, guys.
-Hello.

1023
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,862
-Hello.
-How was it?
-[overlapping chatter]

1024
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:25,758
-It was-it was...
-Yeah, Drew, right there, buddy.

1025
00:44:25,862 --> 00:44:28,137
-Take that.
-Yeah!

1026
00:44:28,241 --> 00:44:30,655
-JAKE: Fetal position commence.
-[overlapping chatter]

1027
00:44:30,758 --> 00:44:32,206
[laughter]

1028
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,689
AUSTIN:
Getting back to camp,

1029
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:36,068
I'm feeling a little bit uneasy.

1030
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:37,862
Every time I think
about this vote,

1031
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:39,724
there's one thing
that holds me back, really,

1032
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:41,862
and the one thing
that makes it really hard

1033
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:44,586
for me to ultimately decide.
"Let's get Julie out."

1034
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:46,620
And that is telling Dee.

1035
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:49,000
We're at the stage
in this game where

1036
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,379
every move we make
is gonna hurt a lot.

1037
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:55,931
And that's the cost of getting
close with people in Survivor.

1038
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:58,034
It's been a big, big battle,

1039
00:44:58,137 --> 00:45:01,172
trying to figure out what
the best move to make will be.

1040
00:45:04,758 --> 00:45:06,517
AUSTIN:
On one end,
I could blindside Dee

1041
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,034
and potentially ruin one of my
greatest relationships out here.

1042
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:11,655
Or I can tell Dee

1043
00:45:11,758 --> 00:45:13,827
and potentially have
that information leaked back

1044
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:16,034
to Julie
and ruin the entire plan.

1045
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:18,172
So I've been doing the numbers,
crunching everything,

1046
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:20,103
thinking it through for days.

1047
00:45:20,206 --> 00:45:23,206
Do I tell Dee, and if so, how?

1048
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:26,241
Well, first off, like...

1049
00:45:26,344 --> 00:45:27,931
DEE:
Well, I can tell you
what we talked about

1050
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:29,310
-and then, or if you want to...
-Okay. Sounds good.

1051
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:30,655
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1052
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:32,068
Well, we're thinking Emily,

1053
00:45:32,172 --> 00:45:34,827
and then we're telling Emily
Jake, but, um,

1054
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:36,379
-I don't know. I just feel
-Yeah. No.

1055
00:45:36,482 --> 00:45:38,206
that that's not the plan
for you guys.

1056
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,482
-[soft, rolling thunder]
-It's a weird spot right now.

1057
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:43,068
-Yeah.
-Um...

1058
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:45,137
I guess, first off...

1059
00:45:46,172 --> 00:45:49,103
I definitely, like...
[clicks tongue]

1060
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:51,448
I think this is gonna be
the hardest vote right now.

1061
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:54,000
I think there's a strong...
Well...

1062
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:56,034
[sighs]
I mean,

1063
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:59,448
if we think about
potential ways to the end...

1064
00:46:09,379 --> 00:46:11,310
No.

1065
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:21,000
-[soft, rolling thunder]
-AUSTIN: Um,

1066
00:46:21,103 --> 00:46:23,793
-it's a weird spot right now.
-DEE: Yeah.

1067
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:25,275
There's a strong movement
against Julie.

1068
00:46:25,379 --> 00:46:27,931
-...
-I know.

1069
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:29,965
And my heart, still, like,

1070
00:46:30,068 --> 00:46:32,241
it hurts thinking
of voting for her.

1071
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:34,310
And I-I don't know. That part
of me is still telling me

1072
00:46:34,413 --> 00:46:35,827
that that's not gonna happen.

1073
00:46:35,931 --> 00:46:37,482
But I just think,

1074
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,896
everyone wants it
really badly now.

1075
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
What do you want?

1076
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,620
[sighs]

1077
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:47,758
I would not
write her name down, just like

1078
00:46:47,862 --> 00:46:49,172
I won't write your name down.

1079
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:50,655
I don't want
to write hers down, either,

1080
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:52,000
but I think even if we don't,

1081
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,034
even if neither of us
write her name down,

1082
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:55,896
-She's still gone?
-I think she still goes home.

1083
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,034
DEE:
For sure, I'm gonna cry.

1084
00:46:58,137 --> 00:46:59,758
Like, I don't even want
to think about it,

1085
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:01,896
because I love Julie,

1086
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,689
but I can't show
what I'm feeling

1087
00:47:03,793 --> 00:47:05,793
because my emotions right now
don't matter.

1088
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:07,724
I knew that this day would come.

1089
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:09,689
Like, I knew
that we would have to...

1090
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,724
break apart from each other.

1091
00:47:11,827 --> 00:47:14,241
But I never...

1092
00:47:14,344 --> 00:47:16,896
thought that it would be me
making a decision

1093
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,413
with Julie involved.

1094
00:47:18,517 --> 00:47:20,379
It feels like
it's still too soon.

1095
00:47:20,482 --> 00:47:23,206
Why is Emily not an option
right now?

1096
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,689
-She is.
-Mm-hmm.

1097
00:47:25,793 --> 00:47:29,172
But there's Drew, Emily,

1098
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:32,000
Jake, Katurah wanting Julie,

1099
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:33,517
and on the other side,

1100
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,965
there's you, Julie,
and in a way, me.

1101
00:47:36,068 --> 00:47:38,551
So the only way
to save her would be

1102
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,034
to get her to play the idol,
and then

1103
00:47:41,137 --> 00:47:42,931
-that could come back
and bite us.
-Yeah.

1104
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:44,689
Oh, a thousand percent,
it would bite us.

1105
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:46,896
-Yeah?
-Everybody would be against us.

1106
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,379
-Exactly.
-Well, me, for sure.

1107
00:47:49,482 --> 00:47:51,034
My mind is going crazy right now

1108
00:47:51,137 --> 00:47:53,137
because Julie's
my other number one.

1109
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:55,758
If I choose to vote Julie out,
it's just me and Austin.

1110
00:47:55,862 --> 00:47:57,344
There's still seven people

1111
00:47:57,448 --> 00:47:59,034
left in the game.

1112
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:01,034
Like, there's still more game to
be played, more twists to come.

1113
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:03,310
And if I don't have
my two number ones,

1114
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,413
then I'm in the chopping block.

1115
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:07,689
Nice. Gosh, you're great, Julie.

1116
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:09,034
DEE:
And then if I tell Julie

1117
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,620
about her potentially
going home,

1118
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:12,241
then my game is blown.

1119
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:13,724
-EMILY: Nice.
-JULIE: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1120
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:15,034
DEE:
This is the biggest decision

1121
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:16,586
I've had to make in the game.

1122
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:18,344
Austin is trusting me
by telling me this information.

1123
00:48:18,448 --> 00:48:21,241
And so far, I've played
this game with heart.

1124
00:48:21,344 --> 00:48:23,931
I'm gonna follow my intuition,
and I'm gonna

1125
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,448
continue playing this game
with heart.

1126
00:48:29,137 --> 00:48:33,241
But you need to put on
your biggest acting face

1127
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,551
you've ever put on in your life.

1128
00:48:35,655 --> 00:48:37,241
Not me again.

1129
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:39,241
You have to
play your idol tonight,

1130
00:48:39,344 --> 00:48:41,517
and we're gonna vote Emily out.

1131
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,034
But you have to put on your
biggest acting face, okay?

1132
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:46,000
Okay. So, you think
I'm another option?

1133
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,344
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

1134
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,034
But you're not gonna go home.
You're gonna play your idol

1135
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:54,275
-and we're both gonna
put it on Emily.
-Wow.

1136
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:55,827
They're actually gonna
try and blindside me.

1137
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:59,689
Drew, Austin-- my alliance
from the beginning--

1138
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:02,172
they all want to vote me out?

1139
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:03,724
I'm mad.

1140
00:49:03,827 --> 00:49:07,482
I have done nothing
but protect you people,

1141
00:49:07,586 --> 00:49:10,103
and you're turning on me now

1142
00:49:10,206 --> 00:49:13,068
when we've got easy votes to do?

1143
00:49:13,172 --> 00:49:15,758
Come on.
Man up and face me

1144
00:49:15,862 --> 00:49:17,344
when there's three left.

1145
00:49:17,448 --> 00:49:19,000
That was the plan.

1146
00:49:22,517 --> 00:49:24,172
[soft, rolling thunder]

1147
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:26,172
Y'all feel comfortable
about tonight?

1148
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:27,689
-Not a bit.
-No.

1149
00:49:30,172 --> 00:49:32,172
-EMILY: Mm-hmm.
-...it's one of you guys.

1150
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,724
Who?

1151
00:49:56,517 --> 00:49:58,172
[crackling thunder]

1152
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:05,344
If y'all feel good about it,
I'll write Austin.

1153
00:50:05,448 --> 00:50:07,103
If I don't hear from y'all...

1154
00:50:07,206 --> 00:50:09,586
-EMILY: Mm-hmm.
-I'm going rogue, people.

1155
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:12,034
They're not gonna make a move.

1156
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:14,448
They're gonna go
with the numbers.

1157
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:16,137
They don't know
that I have an idol.

1158
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:19,517
Austin gave me an idol, and

1159
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,310
I'm playing it, so,

1160
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:25,172
if every single person is
writing down my name, whoever

1161
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:26,827
I name goes home.

1162
00:50:26,931 --> 00:50:28,965
Okay.

1163
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:32,896
So everyone here
is on the same page?

1164
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,241
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1165
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:35,758
Um...

1166
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:38,620
-...to flip it on Austin.
-Austin.

1167
00:50:38,724 --> 00:50:40,448
So she's like,

1168
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:42,000
"Maybe we can get Katurah
to write down Austin."

1169
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:44,000
-So she knows?
-She's scrambling

1170
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:45,517
for what's supposed
to be an easy vote.

1171
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,758
-She's trying
to flip it on Austin?
-Yeah.

1172
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:50,379
DREW:
I think someone
spilled the beans to Julie.

1173
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:51,896
That's exactly
what I don't want.

1174
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I want a cool and calm,
complacent camp.

1175
00:50:57,103 --> 00:50:59,551
If Julie found out about this
plan, she would play her idol,

1176
00:50:59,655 --> 00:51:02,172
and then anyone could go home
in this vote.

1177
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:03,448
That is the real danger.

1178
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,758
AUSTIN:
Anything while I was gone?

1179
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:06,344
DREW:
Yes.

1180
00:51:06,448 --> 00:51:08,896
When it was Jake,
Emily and Julie alone here,

1181
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,241
Julie got paranoid
and pitched you to them.

1182
00:51:11,344 --> 00:51:13,137
-Me?
-Yeah.

1183
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,344
So basically, Julie was just
like, "I can maybe get Katurah

1184
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:16,758
to write down Austin's name."

1185
00:51:16,862 --> 00:51:17,965
-For real?
-EMILY: Yeah.

1186
00:51:19,103 --> 00:51:20,137
AUSTIN:
I had to tell Dee.

1187
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:22,310
If I were to blindside Julie

1188
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,655
without telling Dee,

1189
00:51:24,758 --> 00:51:26,689
then, our trust
is completely broken.

1190
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,344
JULIE:
Dee, can I talk
to you for a second?

1191
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:29,586
-Yes. Okay.
-Very quick second?

1192
00:51:29,689 --> 00:51:31,344
AUSTIN:
It is crucial

1193
00:51:31,448 --> 00:51:33,206
that Dee does not tell Julie.

1194
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:36,620
And in Dee's shoes,
that's so hard.

1195
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,206
Hmm.

1196
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,103
I don't think so.

1197
00:51:42,206 --> 00:51:44,413
But now that
my name's out there...

1198
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:47,068
Yeah, if she plays something,
I'll play something.

1199
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:48,517
-Okay.
-Right.

1200
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,413
Right now, there are two
potential targets--

1201
00:51:50,517 --> 00:51:52,448
Emily and Julie.

1202
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:55,896
If worst comes to worst, we can
easily vote out Emily tonight.

1203
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,413
But logically,

1204
00:51:57,517 --> 00:51:59,896
I can't bring Julie
because she will win.

1205
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,310
Tonight,
I'll be bringing my amulet,

1206
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:05,310
which is an idol that's active
until the final six.

1207
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:09,068
If things get crazy, I might
have to it play tonight, but

1208
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:11,241
I'm planning on playing it
at next Tribal.

1209
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:17,827
Why don't I just write Austin?

1210
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:19,482
No, you're getting
too personal about it.

1211
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,793
No. Emily is more of a threat.

1212
00:52:21,896 --> 00:52:23,482
Austin's about
to write my name down.

1213
00:52:23,586 --> 00:52:25,068
But he doesn't want to.

1214
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:27,137
Like, I don't think
he's the mastermind behind this.

1215
00:52:27,241 --> 00:52:29,000
-It's Drew.
-It's Drew.

1216
00:52:29,103 --> 00:52:30,344
-I know.
-We have to separate them.

1217
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:31,586
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1218
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:33,275
If I take out Austin,
Drew's weak.

1219
00:52:33,379 --> 00:52:35,724
-Hmm.
-I mean, I don't want
to take out Austin, but...

1220
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:37,482
Yeah, but Austin's also
my number one, though.

1221
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:38,965
-I know he is.
-You know what I mean?

1222
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:41,517
-I know that. No.
-Please don't do that.

1223

She's paranoid, and that's
what scares me. Literally,

my world is in Julie's hands.

1225
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:48,000
My family's lives
are in Julie's hands.

-They're gonna write you, okay?
-Yup.

1230
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,931
-I'm gonna write you, too.
-Yup.

1231
00:52:58,034 --> 00:53:00,344
-Because then we're gonna
hate each other after this.
-Okay.

1232
00:53:00,448 --> 00:53:02,137
And you're gonna play your idol
and you're writing Emily.

-Got you. Got you.
-Okay?

JULIE:
She just told me
that Austin's her number one.

1235
00:53:06,655 --> 00:53:08,137
Will she pick him over me?

1236
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:10,275
Maybe it's better
that I take her number one out.

but I want to vote for Austin.

1240
00:53:17,034 --> 00:53:20,275

what to do.

21 days in, does it get

1251
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:16,655
easier or more difficult

but these are real people?

1254
00:54:21,379 --> 00:54:23,275
You know, I think it gets harder

1255
00:54:23,379 --> 00:54:25,517
because you get
to know people better.

1256

You get to learn more

where they come from in life.

1259

I think.

-DREW: Yeah, Jeff. I do think

1261

that, paradoxically,
as the game goes along,

1262
00:54:38,206 --> 00:54:39,689
it does get actually easier.

1263
00:54:39,793 --> 00:54:42,517
Like, we are so close
to the end, and

1264
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,206
that gives you a lot
of perspective

1265
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,827
about why you're out here and
who you're playing for at home.

1269
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:53,137
with Drew that it gets easier?

1270
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:54,655
Yes.

1271
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,137
Actually, I do, because,
like, the first ones that

1272
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:02,172
made the jury--
those hurt so much.

1273
00:55:02,275 --> 00:55:04,172
But at some point you just got

1274
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:06,586
to give yourself permission
to play the game.

1275
00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:10,413
So, Katurah,
how do you separate it?

1276

to get to the end
and I want to win."

1280
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:19,758
So, how does that play out?

1281
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:22,379
I think it plays out differently
for each player,

1282
00:55:22,482 --> 00:55:25,241
and I think some people
can acknowledge the closeness

1283
00:55:25,344 --> 00:55:27,551
of a relationship
but still understand,

1284
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:28,965
"I have to remove emotion

1285
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:31,620
from this decision
if I want to get far."

1286
00:55:31,724 --> 00:55:34,758
Otherwise, we've seen people
say, "I'd rather you win.

1287
00:55:34,862 --> 00:55:36,862
I don't want to vote you out."

1288
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:39,172
Things like that happen,
and you can only imagine

1289
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:41,068
it's due to the closeness
of those relationships.

00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,655
PROBST:
Emily, how about for you?

1291
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:44,655
You know, to sum it up, I think

1292
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,241
there's a lot
of very full bags tonight.

1293
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,931
I'm not sure
if anybody came here--

1294
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:49,275
with the exception
of maybe Drew--

1295
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,310
without everything packed.

1296
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:53,000
And so I think a lot of people

1297
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:55,413
are planning on possibly
not going back to camp.

1298
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:59,137
So, Drew, it was
an interesting afternoon, then?

1299
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:01,482
Yeah, absolutely it was,
and I'll tell you,

1300
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:02,896

to have this bad boy on,

00:56:04,931 --> 00:56:07,344

-All right then.
-Oh, boy.

for a sense of

-what was happening
back at camp.
-DREW: All right.

1309
00:56:27,103 --> 00:56:29,655
But first, an historical
reference, a callback.

00:56:29,758 --> 00:56:31,275
Please.

1311
00:56:31,379 --> 00:56:34,827
DREW:
When the philosopher
Hegel first met Napoleon,

1312
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:37,068
he wrote that it was
as if a new era of history

1313
00:56:37,172 --> 00:56:39,275
had stood before him
right there.

1314
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:40,896
And I think when Bruce left,

1315
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,827
there was a real sense that
here was a hinge in the game,

1316
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:45,896
and that now, more than ever,
you needed to start

1317
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,034
to prepare yourself
for a final three.

1318
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:51,172
And I think that a lot
of people are wondering, like,

1319
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:54,896
on this new page of history,
uh, where they stand.

1320
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,172
So, Julie, it sounds like
anything can happen.

1321
00:56:57,275 --> 00:56:58,862

staying alive anymore.

00:57:01,482 --> 00:57:03,896
It's who you're gonna be with
at the end.

1324

love one another so much,

1325
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:09,793

1326
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:12,551
to write
someone's name down that

1327
00:57:12,655 --> 00:57:14,896
I love just as much
as the next person.

00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,655

Is that what it was
for you, Emily?

1329
00:57:16,758 --> 00:57:18,896
EMILY:
Yeah, I think that's
definitely accurate.

1330
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,310
Just, there's an element of this
game that you don't prepare for,

1331
00:57:22,413 --> 00:57:25,241
which is, you know,
getting really, really close

1332
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:29,000
to somebody, and we all
like each other so much.

1333
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:32,310
Like, look, I-I put
on a stone face a lot of times,

1334
00:57:32,413 --> 00:57:34,172
but, like, you know,
you have to have a heart,

1335
00:57:34,275 --> 00:57:35,551
and this... this is...

1336
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:37,689
This game rips your heart out
sometimes.

1337
00:57:37,793 --> 00:57:40,275
AUSTIN:
You know, Jeff, we're all
huge fans of the game.

1338
00:57:40,379 --> 00:57:42,413
We've been dreaming of this
for so long, and knowing that

1339
00:57:42,517 --> 00:57:44,413
you're playing a part
in potentially, you know,

1340
00:57:44,517 --> 00:57:46,758
ending someone's dream--
it takes a toll.

1341
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:50,241
And we've been
walking this line between

1342
00:57:50,344 --> 00:57:52,068
playing really hard and ruthless

1343
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:54,482
but also really connecting
as a family.

1344
00:57:54,586 --> 00:57:58,551
And so, now it's trying to
figure out whose paths align.

1345
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:00,862
Do you have any paths that align
with other people's paths,

1346
00:58:00,965 --> 00:58:03,862
and can you work together
to get to the end?

1347
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:08,310
Katurah, how much talk is there

1348
00:58:08,413 --> 00:58:11,206
of idols being in the game
or advantages being in the game?

1349
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:12,862
And does the fact
that there hasn't been

1350
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:17,724
a lot of advantages or idols
played this season make you

1351
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,793
more comfortable
or more unnerved?

1352
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,344
KATURAH:
I'm extremely worried.

1353
00:58:21,448 --> 00:58:23,344
I actually think that means

1354
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:25,379
people have been holding their
cards close to their chest,

1355
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:29,482
and that's a higher risk of
things to start coming out now

1356
00:58:29,586 --> 00:58:32,896
when the numbers are tight,
when people are more at risk.

1357
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And so, all it takes is one
person to say, "You know what?

1358
00:58:36,103 --> 00:58:38,068
I'm feeling too worried.
Let me play something,"

1359
00:58:38,172 --> 00:58:40,241
and your plan
completely goes away.

1360
00:58:40,344 --> 00:58:43,310
