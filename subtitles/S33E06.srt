1
00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:02,930
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:07,541
In the Ikabula tribe, 
Sunday and Bret were in the minority.

3
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:09,581
I went from a quartet to a duo.

4
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:11,256
In the Takali tribe,

5
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:14,011
Figgy and Taylor 
were trying to hide their romance.

6
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:15,559
Don't hug me!

7
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:18,051
And Adam found himself 
in a position of strength

8
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,595
between two Gen X

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,130
and Gen Y lovers.

10
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,118
It is with me 
that they must work.

11
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:24,491
In the Vanua tribe,

12
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:26,126
Gen X had control,

13
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,161
but there were cracks 
between them.

14
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,338
So it's Cece.

15
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,039
- I mean... 
- I will.

16
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,735
And Chris used his ties to Zeke 
to enlist Gen Y.

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,303
I'm ready to take a hit.

18
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,338
Finally, I have an opening 
in this game.

19
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:41,550
At the council,

20
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,119
the Gen X gave 
up their numerical advantage

21
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,244
and to Cece.

22
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,014
Cece, the tribe has spoken.

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,349
Good luck to everyone.

24
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:51,823
There are 15 left.

25
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:53,748
Who will be eliminated tonight?

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:03,997
The fight goes on!

27
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:05,612
It was really good.

28
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:09,669
The return of the council 
was a complete relief.

29
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:12,899
Chris and I said goodbye 
to Cece with these two Gen Ys.

30
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:14,738
Let's rekindle the fire!

31
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:16,542
Good boy! Good boy!

32
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:20,322
It was clearly the right thing to do 
for the future.

33
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:24,106
It's no longer Gen Y against Gen X,

34
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:26,620
it's my trusted 
people against your trusted people.

35
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,755
It was great 
voting with you today.

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,091
It was a pleasure 
voting with you and Michelle.

37
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,080
- It had to be done. 
- And you kept your word.

38
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,738
The advice was a delight,

39
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,032
car ces idiots by Gen X

40
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:41,506
fired one of their own

41
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:44,413
in the only tribe 
where they were in the majority!

42
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:48,608
Suddenly, I seem to be 
in a strong position with Chris.

43
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,152
I'm so happy.

44
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,679
I'm a new man 
in this game of Survivor.

45
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,372
I am really hungry.

46
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,272
It's horrible.

47
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:14,968
Everyone is hungry 
and grumpy.

48
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:19,039
But I have to stay focused, 
because I have this passion,

49
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:20,869
in me, who says,

50
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:23,919
"You have to watch over your family."

51
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,912
Do you want to go get 
some dead buds?

52
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:27,055
Downright.

53
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,414
I have my mother, and my sister,

54
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:31,711
and I never had a father.

55
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:35,586
For me, it was, "I have to watch 
over these two beautiful ladies."

56
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,691
Gen Ys are said to be selfish, 
want to do everything their way

57
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,088
and do whatever they want.

58
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:42,662
But this is not true.

59
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:44,623
It's for my family.

60
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,924
I will win Survivor.

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,504
Do you see something?

62
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,340
Jeez, where are they hiding these idols?

63
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,775
I do not know.

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,142
The immunity idol 
is the only comfort.

65
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,288
I have to find her.

66
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,215
And I look for her everywhere.

67
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,220
Here, that's weird.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,495
It's the symbol of the tribe, huh?

69
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,194
There is a small green symbol

70
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,406
and I'm like, 
"What the hell is this?"

71
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,163
Seeing the acronym, 
I know she's around.

72
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,905
But I go, 
"No, fuck, she's not here!"

73
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,067
I look in the tree and around,

74
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:28,215
and boom! I break the bamboo...

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,520
Hell, I knew it!

76
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,722
So what...

77
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,393
I hear the Survivor theme playing 
in the background!

78
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,423
And I'm like, 
"This is so awesome, this is awesome!"

79
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,531
Dude, open your eyes.

80
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:45,767
Brothel!

81
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:49,404
- I have an idol! 
- Dude!

82
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:50,797
Oh my God!

83
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,472
- Dude! 
- Lord!

84
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,844
This idol means,

85
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,880
"Mom, this is one step closer 
to your house."

86
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:02,417
This is probably 
my best day in Survivor.

87
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,785
I'm so happy.

88
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,223
- Man, it stays between us. 
- Yeah.

89
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:11,251
What is that?

90
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,928
"Hey! What do you have there?"

91
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:16,180
- Where did you find her? 
- On the ground.

92
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:20,102
I come across these two, 
huddled together like Eskimos,

93
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,104
and appears this idol.

94
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,494
Now 
we know they don't.

95
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,073
- So it's all good? 
- Yeah.

96
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:28,702
Jay is one of my allies,

97
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:30,337
but do I think he would play

98
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:31,995
this idol for me?

99
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,140
Surely not!

100
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,571
- Bad timing. 
- Horrible.

101
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,087
Damn Michaela!

102
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,590
For now, I won't tell anyone 
that Jay has the idol.

103
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,850
But if I get wind 
of something going on,

104
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:45,325
I will swing it.

105
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,983
Over here, everyone!

106
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,504
Discover the new Vanua tribe.

107
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,429
Cece was eliminated

108
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,331
at the last tip.

109
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,534
And lots of reactions.

110
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,914
Figgy, you were the first.

111
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,716
You cheered 
as soon as it was Cece.

112
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,667
I love Michelle, so...

113
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,046
I love Zeke too, 
but I was very, very worried.

114
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,233
Said like that, 
it's horrible, sorry.

115
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:51,059
Michelle and I 
are very close, I adore her.

116
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,776
Michelle. Does it concern you 
that in such a game,

117
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:56,563
Figgy be so open?

118
00:05:56,688 --> 00:06:00,202
No. I think 
the truth actually works well in this game.

119
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,661
You must be

120
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,666
the first person to say that, 
"Truth works well in this game."

121
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,202
Ready for 
today's reward event?

122
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,005
Today,

123
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,599
one person will be your voice.

124
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,587
The others will be blindfolded.

125
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:17,399
By oral commands alone,

126
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,549
the voice will lead 
his blindfolded comrades

127
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:21,648
to collect puzzle pieces.

128
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,516
When you have them all,

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,097
the voice will direct 
a comrade always blindfolded

130
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,523
to solve the puzzle.

131
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,145
- Oh my God! 
- My God!

132
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,434
The first two tribes to finish 
win a reward.

133
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,106
- Want to know what's at stake? 
- Please!

134
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,506
For the first tribe to finish...

135
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:44,112
Apple pie,

136
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:47,107
iced tea,

137
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,275
cold milk.

138
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,216
- Milk! 
- Apple pie!

139
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:53,647
For the 2nd tribe to finish, not bad, 
chocolate chip cookies.

140
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,752
Good. Takali, you are one more.

141
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,509
- Who will not participate? 
- I ss.

142
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,522
Jessica will not participate 
for Takali.

143
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:04,833
Ikabula, you are two more.

144
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,226
Who will it be?

145
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:07,592
Bret and me.

146
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,871
Bret and Hannah 
will not participate for Ikabula.

147
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,717
All three on the bench. 
The others, a minute of organization

148
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:13,967
and here we go.

149
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:23,218
Here we go, for a nice reward.

150
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,420
Survivors, ready? 
Go!

151
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,490
- To the right. 
- Ahead. To the right!

152
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,949
Carry on, forward!

153
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,027
A little to the left! Carry on!

154
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,787
It's all about communication.

155
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,942
Ken, left! 
Straight! To the left!

156
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,855
Are your instructions clear?

157
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,127
- All right, keep going! 
- On your right, there you are!

158
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,302
Carry on!

159
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:46,833
Advance! Stop! 
You are at this pole where we turn!

160
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,211
- Sunday is at an obstacle. 
- Turn right!

161
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,913
Go to your left! 
Keep it up, Zeke!

162
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,624
Attention! So!

163
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:55,855
Adam tries to reach 
for puzzle pieces.

164
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,243
Undo it, Adam!

165
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,989
Sunday continues, his head is spinning!

166
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:01,818
She freed them!

167
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,892
She falls, that's what happens!

168
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,652
Sunday is confused.

169
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,896
Adam has puzzle pieces.

170
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,147
That's it, Zeke!

171
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,024
Zeke reached for coins.

172
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:14,685
There are four coin packs 
per tribe.

173
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,431
Michaela, pull the rope! 
Right in front of you! Here, shoot!

174
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:20,108
Michaela unwinds the rope

175
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,501
for Ikabula.

176
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,547
Adam brought the 1st pieces 
to the table for Takali.

177
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,226
Turn to your left!

178
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:28,783
Turn... Yes!

179
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,270
Advance!

180
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:31,908
David, move on!

181
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,084
Taylor! Pull the rope!

182
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,899
Second package of coins 
for Takali.

183
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,673
They are widening the gap!

184
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,381
Stop! Go to the touch, 
on the thing!

185
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,676
Sunday, right. 
The table is right there.

186
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:47,682
Sunday has the first package of coins 
for Ikabula.

187
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:50,305
Yes, that's it, Chris! 
Turn it!

188
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:54,342
To your right, David, to your right!

189
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,102
David, go right!

190
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,237
Stopped!

191
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,975
Taylor untied a bundle of parts.

192
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,959
Go to your left, Taylor, to the left!

193
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,945
Zeke brings back 
the first parts of Vanua.

194
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,071
That's it?

195
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:10,417
Chris has the second package, 
can he bring it back?

196
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:15,497
Will has the second pack of parts 
for Ikabula.

197
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:18,892
This is the third for Takali.

198
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,095
More than a bundle of coins 
for Takali.

199
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,181
Michaela, can you smell the table? 
Put that on it.

200
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:27,203
Michaela has the third 
pack of coins for Ikabula.

201
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:29,944
Ken and Taylor,

202
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,448
at the fourth station, 
look for their last package.

203
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,974
To the right!

204
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:37,125
Faster, Ken!

205
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:41,034
- Where is it? 
- Right in front of you.

206
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,050
Chris has the 2nd coin pack 
for Vanua.

207
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:45,273
- David... 
- Go through me, it'll go faster.

208
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,095
OK. "Go to your right."

209
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,870
David, go to your right!

210
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,774
David, right again! 
Tell him!

211
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,904
- On your right! 
- David, right!

212
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,986
David does not know where to go.

213
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,171
Right left,

214
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,339
North South?

215
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,874
No, David, no! 
These are not the good ones!

216
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:01,611
Don't, David, don't!

217
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,446
God's goodness!

218
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:10,195
Ken takes a big fall!

219
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,176
The key, the key!

220
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:13,412
Who has the key?

221
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,123
Michaela, turn right!

222
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,517
Grab the rope! Untie it!

223
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,352
Open it and grab the coins!

224
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:20,960
Good!

225
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,990
Yes it's good! Straight!

226
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:25,425
David, come back!

227
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,635
- David, over here! 
- Move!

228
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,162
David, over here!

229
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,823
Ken and Taylor return 
with the final bundle of parts.

230
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:34,142
Its good!

231
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,844
They can attack the puzzle!

232
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,096
Distribute them well!

233
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,515
Figgy and Ken 
will try to solve the puzzle,

234
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,975
Ken, blindfolded.

235
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,643
Yes! Follow the rope!

236
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,183
Here, turn left!

237
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,414
David finally has something to do!

238
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:50,158
David unrolls.

239
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,415
Here are my parts.

240
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,896
Michaela has the fourth 
and final coin pack.

241
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,065
- Straight! 
- Zeke, to your right!

242
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,310
Zeke, to your right!

243
00:10:58,435 --> 00:11:01,618
David and Zeke attempt to retrieve 
the final two for Vanua.

244
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,571
David has a pack of parts.

245
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,839
David, come back!

246
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,821
The table is there. Put them down.

247
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:09,202
Michaela has the fourth 
and final package.

248
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:11,513
- Untie them! 
- Attack the puzzle!

249
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,639
Yes that's it!

250
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:16,151
Big advantage for Takali, 
they have a huge lead

251
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,653
for a huge reward.

252
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,723
David returns 
with the third package for Vanua.

253
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,058
- I feel very weak. 
- Really?

254
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,363
Hurry up, Zeke, 
it's good, it's the last!

255
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,721
Zeke brought back 
the fourth and final package.

256
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,732
They have plenty of time 
to catch up.

257
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,983
Zeke will solve the puzzle.

258
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:35,069
The only problem,

259
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,173
it's that the jigsaw attendants 
are blindfolded.

260
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,500
She feels weak.

261
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,743
So come over here.

262
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,136
Get in the shade.

263
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,859
- Tell me if you need the doctor. 
- OK. Its good.

264
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,333
Do not hesitate to ask!

265
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,546
Take the one on the right. No, sorry, 
leave it, but exchange them.

266
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:54,789
Michelle started long after, 
that would be an impressive comeback.

267
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,392
Replace that. 
Yeah, honey.

268
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,686
Figgy and Ken 
had a huge lead.

269
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,096
Can they make it work?

270
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,356
We try, Jeff!

271
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:06,167
Michaela and Jay 
are making some progress.

272
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,369
- Now lift that. 
- Push that one!

273
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,497
The Vanua were dead last.

274
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:14,537
Michelle and Zeke 
do their best to come back up.

275
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:16,536
Turn that one. 
the one you have in hand,

276
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,411
put it on the top left.

277
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:22,275
Figgy tries to figure out 
what's wrong.

278
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,510
- My whole face is tingling. 
- Stay cool.

279
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:28,223
Michelle and Zeke 
collaborate very well.

280
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,081
It could be an amazing comeback

281
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:31,793
if they are right.

282
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,399
Zeke tentacle of pleasure...

283
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,355
- Yes! That's it! 
- And they are right!

284
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,434
What a comeback! 
Vanua wins a huge reward!

285
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:41,769
He remains in second place.

286
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,297
- I can't feel my hands anymore. 
- I'm here.

287
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,466
It's Jay and Michaela,

288
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,797
Figgy and Ken, 
in search of chocolate cookies.

289
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:51,104
Return those two.

290
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,714
Another piece for Jay!

291
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,182
Ken moves another piece.

292
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,842
Michaela slips another coin.

293
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,926
- Jeff, I'm done. 
- Jay thinks he found it.

294
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,654
Return this one!

295
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,427
Ikabula wins the reward!

296
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:05,218
Chocolate chip cookies.

297
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:08,897
They send Takali back to camp 
empty-handed.

298
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:12,130
after having had 
a gigantic lead.

299
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,436
Everything is fine. I'm here.

300
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:16,938
Are you doing well?

301
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,098
I don't know if I'm panicking 
or dehydrated.

302
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:20,736
Doctor! Doctor Joe!

303
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,911
Could you review Hannah?

304
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:26,577
I have cramps in my arms.

305
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:28,950
Because you're breathing 
a little fast, aren't you?

306
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,219
- What's wrong with Hannah? 
- I do not know.

307
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,888
- Don't let me die! 
- But no, everything will be fine.

308
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,477
It's just because 
you're breathing a little fast, okay?

309
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,052
Breathe with me, okay?

310
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:41,415
Slow down. Exhale.

311
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,482
Slowly. That's it.

312
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:45,324
Well, it's getting better.

313
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,461
- Really? 
- Yes everything is fine.

314
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,842
What's going on, Joe?

315
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,373
Hannah must have gotten a little excited 
during the ordeal

316
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,842
and begin to breathe 
a little too quickly.

317
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,637
And if we do this for no good reason, 
physically,

318
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:00,481
it can reduce the acidity of the blood 
and one of the symptoms,

319
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,017
it's spasms 
in the wrist and hand.

320
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,986
But Hannah was able to calm down

321
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,946
and it already seems to be going away.

322
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:10,741
You seem to know it, 
to be aware of what is going on.

323
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,930
I knew coming here 
that panic attacks,

324
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:17,235
this is something that happens to me. 
But I would have preferred without an audience.

325
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:22,604
If anything should reveal 
your weaknesses, it's Survivor.

326
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:26,319
It's brave 
to have come here despite that.

327
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,324
We'll take you back to your tribe 
and give you more water.

328
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:30,939
Thanks. Thank you.

329
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,238
Good. How are you.

330
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:35,798
No need to applaud!

331
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:41,748
How are you, Hannah?

332
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,109
- Much better, thank you. 
- It shows.

333
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,127
Thank you, Dr. Joe. 
Yes, I feel better.

334
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,620
Good. Let's go to the result.

335
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:51,003
A spectacular comeback 
led by Michelle.

336
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:52,951
Huge reward. 
Come get her!

337
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:55,495
- Pie, cookies, brownies! 
- Take the pie, man!

338
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,837
- Iced tea, milk! 
- I'll take the cupcakes!

339
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:59,932
- Enjoy! 
- Look at this pie!

340
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:04,612
Ikabula, it's not a feast, 
but, Michaela...

341
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,738
I take!

342
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,815
You take? 
Well, come and get them!

343
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,989
- I accept! 
- Enjoy!

344
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:11,043
Thanks, Jeff!

345
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,646
So Figgy...

346
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:17,759
It's a "hero or zero" role, 
when you say, "I'll be the voice."

347
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:19,227
What happened?

348
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,687
It's frustrating when you're so close,

349
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:24,061
that we are the voice, the leader,

350
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,697
we have a puzzle, 
but guiding a blind man is hard.

351
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,404
We think we can get there

352
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,984
and we fail, it sucks.

353
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:32,113
It's hard.

354
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:35,710
Takali, I have nothing for you. 
Pack your things, head back to camp.

355
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,283
Thank you all!

356
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,653
I'm so happy there!

357
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:57,156
It's funny.

358
00:15:57,281 --> 00:15:58,831
Before, I thought to myself,

359
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:01,094
"You're all blocking my 
way to the million."

360
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:03,496
You see? We think about it!

361
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:06,307
And now it's, 
"Oh, my God, pie!"

362
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,389
We probably wouldn't have won 
with Cece.

363
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:11,103
Michelle did everything, 
solve the puzzle, lead us...

364
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:13,545
And of course, 
Figgy seems to really like me!

365
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:16,963
- He missed it, I think. 
- I say.

366
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:19,391
Michelle is a 
very dangerous player.

367
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:22,423
For Figgy announced to the world, 
to the test,

368
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:26,228
"I'm so happy 
to see Michelle."

369
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,750
Then, after a moment,

370
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,364
"Oh, and Zeke too!"

371
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,767
It was, "Hi, Michelle! 
Hey, Zeke!"

372
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:36,621
No, it was, "I love Michelle. 
Oh, and Zeke!"

373
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,166
"Hi, good to see you too!"

374
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,391
I'm clearly 
at the bottom of Gen Y.

375
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,707
My instinct therefore tells me that 
eliminating Michelle

376
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,220
is not bad for me.

377
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:53,179
Because she plotted against me 
and has ties to Taylor and Figgy.

378
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,823
Honestly, 
Figgy owes me his life in this game.

379
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,408
I never thought I would say that.

380
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,608
But I believe that to progress,

381
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,530
I might have to give up 
the Gen Y tribe.

382
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,208
Today 
was a fascinating experience.

383
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,527
A panic attack is not 
necessarily a lot of panic.

384
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,546
It's suppressed panic.

385
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,390
And in this game

386
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,561
one constantly puts one 
's feelings aside.

387
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,130
Today I already know

388
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:38,057
some will laugh at me.

389
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,155
I can't help it 
if I'm anxious.

390
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,037
Of course, it's embarrassing,

391
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,463
to collapse 
without even being in the test.

392
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:48,422
I said to myself, in relation to the game, 
"I must not seem weak."

393
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:52,063
That's the worst, "I mustn't 
be so weak in front of my tribe."

394
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:55,442
Let's give up. I think 
we've proven to ourselves that we can do it.

395
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:58,371
My brain is exhausted.

396
00:17:58,496 --> 00:17:59,754
Not a moment ago

397
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,629
where you can breathe and...

398
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,285
I'm taking a break from Survivor 
for five minutes."

399
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,593
And so, I must continue.

400
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:11,435
Perception is reality. 
I have to repeat that I'm fine,

401
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,526
to let people 
know that I'm fine,

402
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,202
so that it doesn't handicap my game.

403
00:18:24,157 --> 00:18:25,404
I'm too co-happy

404
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:26,738
to have my coco!

405
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:28,107
I'm too co-happy

406
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,676
to have my coco!

407
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,391
- Thanks! 
- Go on!

408
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,123
- It was on the cheek, not the lips. 
- Too cute.

409
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:42,414
How about we make out in 
front of you, Adam?

410
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,540
Disgusting!

411
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:47,034
My Survivor romance is 
growing every day.

412
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,404
But Figgy tells me, 
"Don't talk to Jess and Ken

413
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,845
of our history!"

414
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,266
Of this little romance we have.

415
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,078
But Gen Y are in the majority,

416
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,913
so we are well placed.

417
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,905
We are the dominant couple.

418
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,752
At this point, there 
is no reason to hide.

419
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,811
Everyone knows except Ken and Jess.

420
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,788
It can't harm us.

421
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,425
- Adam is with us, so... 
- I know, honey.

422
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,752
Should I tell Jess?

423
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,947
I would train with me, 
quickly.

424
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,698
Are you going to do Jess?

425
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:20,835
Health!

426
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,497
So, Taylor and I,

427
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,942
there's something between us.

428
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:29,168
Oh, I knew it!

429
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,044
I knew it, darling!

430
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,349
There, we have the majority, with Adam.

431
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:35,668
But coming out 
worries me.

432
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,474
God, isn't it gonna be weird?

433
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,445
Yes, it will be weird. 
But will do it.

434
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,057
I don't know 
what reaction to expect.

435
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,390
- Hey, my little lady! 
- Hi!

436
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:47,795
I want to talk to you about something.

437
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,223
It's the scariest. Will the reaction 
be good or bad?

438
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:54,001
I didn't tell you

439
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,671
nor to Ken, because I was nervous,

440
00:19:57,143 --> 00:20:00,570
but there is something 
between Taylor and me.

441
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,682
Serious?!

442
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:10,014
You are to die for!

443
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:11,701
Wait, really, did you know?

444
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:14,946
You're not very good 
at keeping secrets.

445
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:17,116
Ken, I was telling Jessica...

446
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,504
There's some kind of thing 
between me and Taylor.

447
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,841
No kidding?!

448
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:24,457
- I never would have guessed. 
- Really?

449
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:27,568
Well, when I wake up in the morning 
and see you

450
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,233
entwined, holding your hand...

451
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:33,332
Or when you're always 
looking at yourself and looking for yourself...

452
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:34,860
You laugh?

453
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,861
I wasn't born yesterday, kid!

454
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,443
I 
rolled my bump a lot more than you and...

455
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,974
It's obvious!

456
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:45,043
And she was shocked, convinced she was 
hiding it wonderfully.

457
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:48,456
I who thought 
I would reveal a secret to you!

458
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,358
I appreciate you bringing it up, but...

459
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,617
Not surprised.

460
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:54,028
These kids think they're in charge.

461
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,986
They think, "It's the holidays, 
we're having fun, I'm in Survivor,

462
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:58,274
It's awesome!"

463
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:01,670
But this little couple, 
they're less cool than they think.

464
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,750
I'm not going to sit idle 
and hope everything goes well.

465
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,589
I will act to make sure.

466
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,679
Over here, everyone!

467
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,394
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

468
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,108
First, 
I have to take back the idols.

469
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:41,275
See you soon, Junior!

470
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,131
We'll trade it for the big one.

471
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:50,748
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

472
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:51,874
Today,

473
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,321
you will cross 
a series of floating beams,

474
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,724
collect bags of coconuts,

475
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,952
bring them back to the beach.

476
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:03,414
When you have them all, 
open them to find three balls.

477
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,302
Two players 
will then maneuver these balls

478
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,828
on a table-maze.

479
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,775
The first two tribes 
to bring their three balls to the end

480
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,788
gain immunity, 
are shielded from the vote.

481
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:18,412
The losers will go to the board

482
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:22,616
where someone will be the sixth person 
eliminated from this game.

483
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,375
Takali, you are one more. 
Who will not participate?

484
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,488
- Me. 
- Adam won't participate.

485
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,381
Ikabula, you are two more.

486
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:31,166
- Who will it be? 
- We.

487
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,421
All three on the bench. 
The others, a minute of organization

488
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:36,689
and we start.

489
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,161
Good.

490
00:22:42,286 --> 00:22:44,630
Let's go. For immunity. 
Survivors, ready?

491
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:50,744
Ken is in the water,

492
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,071
Jay is in the water

493
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:53,647
and David is in the water.

494
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:57,007
Ken moves fast,

495
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:58,152
but he falls.

496
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,471
Ken has to start over.

497
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,146
Jay quickly crossed.

498
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:10,064
Now you have to climb 
and land three bags.

499
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:11,724
Jay unties.

500
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:14,769
David and Ken try to catch up with him.

501
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,906
Jay has his second.

502
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:22,309
Ken unties.

503
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:27,273
Ken has his third, 
and a big fall!

504
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:29,950
David has his third.

505
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,318
Well done, David!

506
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,710
David, the big surprise 
of this event!

507
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:36,023
It's Ken who's having trouble.

508
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,377
Jay brings the three bags at once.

509
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,227
David can only bring one,

510
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,688
but he retains the advantage over Ken.

511
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:44,899
Third bag for Ken.

512
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,315
Lord, what a fall!

513
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:48,344
Jay brought the three bags.

514
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:51,205
Bret is in the water for Ikabula.

515
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,331
Come on, Breth!

516
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:56,310
Ken brings the three bags at once, 
catching up on time.

517
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:03,506
David is dragging two bags now.

518
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:05,986
Combined, they weigh more than him!

519
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:09,706
Go!

520
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:11,950
Chris is in the water for Vanua.

521
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,306
Taylor quickly crosses 
the beams.

522
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:16,030
Takali now leads.

523
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,556
Give it your all, baby!

524
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:19,967
Chris arrives, 
he tries to catch up with time

525
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,402
lost by David.

526
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,595
Taylor escalates fast

527
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,548
and fetch 
the last three bags.

528
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,274
Bret is right behind.

529
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,203
Taylor quickly lands 
all three sacks, in one fell swoop.

530
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,473
Bret has his third bag.

531
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,275
Give it your all, you're almost there!

532
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,271
Once Taylor arrives, it's good.

533
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:39,403
Hang them!

534
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,262
Takali has a huge lead.

535
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:45,922
Bret arrives 
with the last three bags.

536
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:48,887
Third bag for Chris.

537
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:52,266
Chris is going to have to be quick 
to stay in the game.

538
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:55,736
Ken and Taylor are fast, 
here is the sixth and final bag.

539
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,365
Its good! 
Over to you, ladies!

540
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,431
It's now Figgy

541
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:00,908
and Jessica.

542
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,309
You have to take out all the coconuts.

543
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:06,680
You are looking for three balls.

544
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,307
Sixth bag for Jay.

545
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,252
Go to the mat! 
Over to you, ladies!

546
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:13,754
Chris is there with his three bags.

547
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:16,523
Michaela and Hannah 
are doing a great job.

548
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:18,450
Go, Vanua!

549
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,653
Michelle and Zeke 
are going to open the bags.

550
00:25:22,716 --> 00:25:25,766
Takali pulled it all out. 
You have to find three balls.

551
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:26,925
There in front.

552
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:32,731
have their three balls. 
Attack the maze!

553
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,302
You have to maneuver 
a very difficult table

554
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:41,448
while having the feet 
on a very small perch.

555
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,574
We manage.

556
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:45,864
Jessica and Figgy 
have a huge lead.

557
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,798
Michaela and Hannah 
opened the last bag.

558
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,380
They have their three balls. 
Ahead!

559
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:56,830
Zeke is on the last sack 
trying to make up time.

560
00:25:58,096 --> 00:25:59,163
And There you go!

561
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:00,793
Find the ball and come here!

562
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:04,663
- It's Figgy and Jessica... 
- We have to go through this though.

563
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:07,766
- ...Michaela and Hannah... 
- Stop making such moves!

564
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,367
...and Zeke and Michelle, 
for immunity.

565
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:18,485
Michelle and Zeke know 
they have some catching up to do.

566
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:20,212
From the outset, they go all out.

567
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:22,381
- Not as much, not as much! 
- Sorry.

568
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:24,657
You hold on too much. 
Just hold it.

569
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:27,088
Michaela continues 
to bark orders at Hannah.

570
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:29,848
Don't move it, 
I'm telling you to just hold it!

571
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:32,024
She makes sure Hannah 
knows who's ordering.

572
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,620
Each duo tries to understand 
the rhythm of the others.

573
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:38,726
Michaela and Hannah 
at a difficult place.

574
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:41,840
You have to go through 
a very narrow passage.

575
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,365
Michaela and Hannah, 
closer than ever.

576
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,770
- Don't move at all! 
- No, I'm just keeping it.

577
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:48,182
Can they do it?

578
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,951
Yes! Hannah and Michaela 
took the lead!

579
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:54,621
Jessica and Figgy are nearby.

580
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,747
Oh my God!

581
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,895
Rushing will only get you 
a date with me at the council.

582
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:03,130
- Don't be frustrated. 
- I'm not.

583
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,857
I'm just trying to make you win.

584
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:06,900
To keep us all here.

585
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,311
Lowers and to the side!

586
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,672
Hannah and Michaela are two up, 
huge lead!

587
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:13,765
Gently, Figg.

588
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,270
Figgy and Jessica are nearby.

589
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:18,345
- Yeah! 
- Yes! Quick, the next one!

590
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,315
Figgy and Jessica 
placed their first ball.

591
00:27:22,197 --> 00:27:24,318
Michelle and Zeke get nowhere.

592
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,121
- Tell me if I should move. 
- The farm!

593
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,438
Hannah and Michaela

594
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,816
may never go 
on vacation together...

595
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,794
I love it! I just need 
people to shut it up sometimes.

596
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,132
Stay fixed!

597
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:37,978
They are inches away 
from immunity.

598
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,224
Lift slightly.

599
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:40,425
Oh my God!

600
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,562
And they succeed!

601
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:45,460
Hannah and Michaela 
win immunity,

602
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:47,042
Ikabula is safe!

603
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,279
You can do anything!

604
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,218
He remains in second place.

605
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:54,363
It's Jessica and Figgy

606
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,408
against Michelle and Zeke

607
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,986
who know they have to 
start something.

608
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:04,158
Zeke, Michelle, only one has to move 
to pass the bar.

609
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:10,046
Now 
Michaela helps Michelle and Zeke.

610
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:12,065
- Stop the ball! 
- Michelle and Zeke...

611
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,659
...are close. Well saved!

612
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:15,027
Can they place it?

613
00:28:15,418 --> 00:28:17,337
A few centimeters away... 
There you go!

614
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,942
Tied, 1 - 1.

615
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,277
Now there is a game!

616
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:23,877
Jessica and Figgy, well saved!

617
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,370
And they place their 2nd!

618
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,647
Well, well!

619
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:29,541
One more bullet 
and Jessica and Figgy win immunity.

620
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,610
The pressure is on Michelle and Zeke.

621
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,687
Nice touch. 
Will she go down the hole?

622
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,047
Let her slide!

623
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,325
One centimeter, and voila! 
Another tie, 2 - 2!

624
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,720
It's the race to the finish.

625
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,330
It all happens there.

626
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,856
Go! Go! Go!

627
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:48,822
If Vanua succeeds, 
it would be a gigantic comeback.

628
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:50,838
Nobody wants to go to the council.

629
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:53,140
Jessica and Figgy arrive.

630
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,319
One more, baby.

631
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:57,869
All around.

632
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,934
Nice recovery 
from Michelle and Zeke.

633
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:04,543
Jessica and Figgy, 
can they save her?

634
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,454
Michelle and Zeke are well placed.

635
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,518
And it is successful, for immunity!

636
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,595
Vanua is safe 
and sends Takali to the council!

637
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:20,202
Someone there will be eliminated from the game.

638
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:24,338
Ikabula.

639
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:25,939
Congratulation.

640
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,076
Immunity. 
No one will leave your tribe.

641
00:29:30,527 --> 00:29:31,528
Vanua.

642
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,904
Congratulation.

643
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,840
No one will leave your tribe.

644
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,143
I have to ask.

645
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:42,370
There was encouragement 
from you, Michaela, for Vanua.

646
00:29:42,495 --> 00:29:43,807
What's there behind?

647
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,220
We would like Gen Y to stay

648
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:49,755
and at 2 - 2, someone has to leave.

649
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:51,390
There are Gen Y here!

650
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:53,153
Yeah, but you are three.

651
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:55,727
If you can't cooperate, 
you deserve to leave.

652
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,497
Ikabula, no one will leave, 
no advice tonight.

653
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:01,433
Take your things, 
return to camp.

654
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:04,302
Vanua. No advice tonight 
for you either.

655
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,804
No one will leave.

656
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,429
Take your things, 
return to camp.

657
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:10,517
Takali, tonight, advice.

658
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,086
Someone will be the sixth person 
eliminated from the game.

659
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,089
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

660
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,350
Takali tribe go to council tonight

661
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,319
It's really too dumb.

662
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,640
But if Gen Y's smart, 
we'll stay together

663
00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:26,841
and we will release the Gen X.

664
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:45,700
Well done, everyone.

665
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:48,058
You worked well.

666
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:50,457
We tried. 
We were so close...

667
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:53,668
That we lost 
is very annoying for me,

668
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:57,731
because since we've been here, 
I've been playing the double agent

669
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,769
and it looks like if I wanted 
to go with Jessica and Ken,

670
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:03,163
I could do it.

671
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:06,198
And if I wanted to go 
with Figgy and Taylor, I could.

672
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,522
But whatever I vote tonight,

673
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:10,807
someone will come back unhappy.

674
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:12,982
My position is very difficult.

675
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:15,707
I am with you.

676
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,652
- Taylor is with you. 
- I say. I know it well.

677
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,521
- So it's Ken or Jessica. 
- Sure.

678
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,647
Most...

679
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,984
- Who would you rather date? 
- Ken, I guess.

680
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:31,423
I do not know. 
It's hard, very hard.

681
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:33,527
I think we should vote Ken.

682
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:35,485
I think so too.

683
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:38,772
So the plan is to take Ken out.

684
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,765
He is a dangerous player

685
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,411
and at the merger, he will be a threat 
in the trials.

686
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,872
I believe we are 
on the same wavelength.

687
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:48,907
- We're taking Ken out. 
- Yes.

688
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:51,243
Tonight, at the council,

689
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,818
we're going to eliminate Ken.

690
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:56,016
Damn, why did we lose? 
I hate that.

691
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:58,455
But who knows? 
Maybe Adam will double cross us,

692
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,084
He's a lot smarter 
than you think.

693
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,165
But maybe!

694
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:06,958
What do you say?

695
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,828
- Do we really trust Adam? 
- I only trust you.

696
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:11,429
I say.

697
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,436
It sucks!

698
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:22,315
Well, if you wanna 
work with me, I got Ken.

699
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,809
It is 100% reliable.

700
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:27,330
One of the two is eliminated

701
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:29,923
and then it's you, me and Ken.

702
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,636
You see? Where does your heart take you 
now?

703
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,304
I do not know.

704
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:37,324
Do you know if they're considering Ken?

705
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:38,450
Sure.

706
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:41,660
Figgy and Taylor vont vote Ken.

707
00:32:41,947 --> 00:32:43,970
But that 
clearly doesn't have to happen.

708
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,231
I need Ken to progress.

709
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:48,567
He covers me and I cover him.

710
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:52,179
And if Ken leaves, 
I'll be next.

711
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:55,549
what you must do,

712
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,921
it is talking to Adam.

713
00:32:57,046 --> 00:33:00,253
You have to convince 
him that you are with him 150%.

714
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,486
Otherwise, he will vote for you.

715
00:33:02,611 --> 00:33:05,350
You have to convince 
him that you will never vote for him.

716
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:08,430
That's what we need to tell him, 
that the three of us will control the game.

717
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,725
I could leave

718
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,138
but I never bow 
without a fight.

719
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,175
So from here the advice,

720
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:17,429
I am going to fight.

721
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:19,531
I respect you. Jess too.

722
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:22,442
We don't want to move forward 
with two sneaky people

723
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,838
and arrogant kids.

724
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,530
So Jess and I are voting Figgy.

725
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:27,305
Do you want to sit there with me,

726
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,078
David and Jess?

727
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,610
Or with Taylor, Figg

728
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:34,279
and popular kids, 
knowing you're at the bottom of the ladder?

729
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:36,870
Basically, what you ask me,

730
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:40,527
it's trusting 
people I don't know.

731
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:44,280
I'll cover you all the way 
and never vote for you.

732
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:45,790
And I will fight for you.

733
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:47,394
So...

734
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,374
All you have to do is decide 
who you want to ride with.

735
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,635
My mind is spinning.

736
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,587
Ken has a strong case.

737
00:34:00,712 --> 00:34:01,955
The question is,

738
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,380
which side will be the best 
for my future in the game?

739
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,600
The whole world is probably screaming, 
"Get out the dominant couple!

740
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:11,111
What are you thinking about?!"

741
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:12,417
But at this point,

742
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:14,780
I don't know 
if that makes sense to me.

743
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,445
Ken, give me a rundown.

744
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,814
' Cause on the surface 
it's easy to say,

745
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,950
"Three Gen Y, two Gen X,

746
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,443
one of you is going."

747
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:41,121
Yes, it is obvious 
that there are only two Gen X.

748
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,731
It clearly sets us apart.

749
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:45,270
Taylor, are you okay?

750
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:47,636
The Gen Ys will stay together.

751
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,554
Yes, that's what I would say.

752
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:52,590
If you can have such a link,

753
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,431
so many things are possible.

754
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,945
even if you started 
with Taylor and Adam,

755
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,166
it doesn't imply 
that you get along.

756
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,867
Yes, not everything is rosy 
between Gen Y.

757
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:07,505
Friends of this guy 
voted for me on the 1st tip!

758
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,248
But I don't blame them.

759
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:11,673
I passed that.

760
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:15,408
Adam, Figgy says she's forgiven you 
for voting for her.

761
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:17,615
Let her look at you 
like she looks at Taylor,

762
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,182
"We are in the same boat."

763
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:22,876
She clearly doesn't look at me 
exactly like Taylor!

764
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:24,814
Let this be very clear!

765
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,459
Whether you call it 
a "showmance" or a romance,

766
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,694
there is "mance" in the air.

767
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:31,371
So Taylor.

768
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,650
Are you in love?

769
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,324
I wouldn't say that.

770
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:36,595
This is going a bit far.

771
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,412
But we love each other very much.

772
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,005
The budding loves!

773
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,651
Ken. Did you notice 
this relationship?

774
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,711
It was hilarious, 
when they came,

775
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:48,788
"Surely you didn't notice it,

776
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,148
but know it,

777
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,826
- Actually, there's something between us." 
- Did you say that?

778
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,719
It was obvious from the start.

779
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:57,127
Being an honorary pastor,

780
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:02,005
if I said to you, 
"To hell with caution!

781
00:36:02,654 --> 00:36:04,573
Let's get married immediately!"

782
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:07,096
Gen Ys do that kind of stuff.

783
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:09,509
We'll get you married right away, 
I'll take care of the papers!

784
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,569
- Lord! 
- A first! Let's go!

785
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:14,769
You are serious? 
I can't tell.

786
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:17,819
I was just saying 
it would be a first.

787
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,894
Taylor. When Figgy says, 
"Let's do it!",

788
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,814
and you say, 
"Are you serious?",

789
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:25,325
she's waiting for you... 
Am I right, Ken?

790
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,019
...that you come forward and confirm 
what she just said,

791
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,823
thus validating his feelings

792
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:31,803
and giving him 
a sense of security

793
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:33,500
in this very deep relationship

794
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,959
born two weeks ago.

795
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:37,194
Oh my God!

796
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,405
So, Figgy.

797
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,206
You don't seem worried

798
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,133
- let it be public. 
- Nope.

799
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:43,982
Me and Taylor, we got our thing,

800
00:36:44,107 --> 00:36:48,014
but we're just two people 
voting together.

801
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,383
As they both vote together.

802
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,518
Jessica and Ken.

803
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:52,644
Exactly.

804
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:54,387
But, Adam, there seems to be

805
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,915
a slight difference 
between Ken and Jessica

806
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,559
voting together by strategy

807
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,283
and Figgy and Taylor 
doing it because they like each other.

808
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:03,455
Sure.

809
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,328
Figgy, you act 
like this is totally insane.

810
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:08,645
Yeah, man! 
We didn't come here for that.

811
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,103
It just happened.

812
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,364
We remain very strategic, 
at each stage.

813
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,166
Taylor. Is it easier

814
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,811
to be honest about your relationship

815
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,702
with the luxury 
of a power play?

816
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:20,916
Yes, clearly.

817
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,583
With that edge, you can just say, 
"You know what?

818
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,117
It's like that.

819
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,153
If you don't like it,

820
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,078
I can write your name."

821
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:33,367
But the majority can change sides 
at any time.

822
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:35,386
It may not be 
all black or white,

823
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:36,946
Gen X or Gen Y.

824
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,265
So Adam.

825
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,426
We have Taylor and Figgy 
who are a couple,

826
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,903
Jessica and Ken, 
who are a strategic duo,

827
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,830
which leaves you in the middle.

828
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:50,151
I think that's okay, Jeff.

829
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:53,404
So Taylor. 
Either Adam remains among you three,

830
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,717
or he joins Jessica and Ken.

831
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:58,476
Yes, he could totally 
turn his jacket around.

832
00:37:58,601 --> 00:37:59,973
But at the merger,

833
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:02,311
Gen Y are already in the majority.

834
00:38:02,436 --> 00:38:05,717
They might be like, 
"Oh, what are you doing, man?",

835
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:07,986
and release it immediately.

836
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:10,397
So you're pretty clear,

837
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,201
if Adam betrays Gen Y, 
you will untap him.

838
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,028
I think Gen Y 
would, all together.

839
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:19,806
- Adam, you must have thought of that. 
- Sure.

840
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,860
The issue goes beyond tonight.

841
00:38:22,985 --> 00:38:25,069
I consider the future

842
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:26,297
and I hope

843
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:29,040
that whoever the four 
who leave tonight,

844
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:30,842
they can be a quartet.

845
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:33,344
Jessica. If these three

846
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:35,021
remain faithful,

847
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,884
you can't do much.

848
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:39,350
I was surprised to notice

849
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:41,055
quarrels in the tribe.

850
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,730
And if you achieve fusion, 
they will still be there.

851
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,723
- Figgy, it makes you react. 
- Yes.

852
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:47,836
I feel like I'm 
having an arm wrestling match.

853
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:49,060
To win Adam?

854
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:50,937
Yes almost. Finally...

855
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,331
You have to remember 
where the majority is.

856
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,401
Jeff, I have one more thing to say.

857
00:38:56,526 --> 00:38:58,570
The person I'm voting for tonight,

858
00:38:58,695 --> 00:39:00,338
I really appreciate it.

859
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,048
It is going to be difficult.

860
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,718
Someone will leave angry

861
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,157
and someone 
will return to camp angry.

862
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,619
Good. It's time to vote.

863
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:16,157
Taylor, over to you.

864
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,487
I will count the votes.

865
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,674
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

866
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,401
now is the time to do it.

867
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,650
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

868
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,177
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

869
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:14,946
I will read the votes.

870
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,160
Ken. 
Two votes Ken.

871
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:33,364
Figgy. Equality. 
Two votes Ken,

872
00:40:33,656 --> 00:40:34,932
two votes Figgy.

873
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,407
One vote remains.

874
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:45,590
Sixth person eliminated 
from Survivor Gen Y against Gen X...

875
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:48,037
Figgy.

876
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,538
Bring me your torch.

877
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,193
I will explain myself, if I can.

878
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:09,277
Figgy, the tribe has spoken.

879
00:41:14,697 --> 00:41:16,140
It's time to go.

880
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:18,443
Good luck, Taylor.

881
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,293
It was said tonight,

882
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,820
"Someone will be eliminated

883
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,729
and someone 
will return to the camp dissatisfied."

884
00:41:31,854 --> 00:41:33,057
The question becomes,

885
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:35,126
how are you going to handle it?

886
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:37,795
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

887
00:41:50,662 --> 00:41:53,226
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

888
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:55,991
Next time in Survivor...

889
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,224
Taylor, the disappointed lover...

890
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,891
I lied to you and I screwed you.

891
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,196
...seeks revenge.

892
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:02,766
I will destroy you!

893
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:04,397
But a powerful new duo...

894
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,231
Zeke, I trust you a lot.

895
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:07,634
...begins to form.

896
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:08,768
We are made of the same wood.

897
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,595
- Do you have the idol? 
- I found it.

898
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,730
God's goodness!

899
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:13,473
He put his life in my hands!

900
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:16,087
I arrived fully launched, 
ready to fight,

901
00:42:16,212 --> 00:42:18,425
and I was clearly 
a force to be reckoned with,

902
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,014
so I take my elimination 
as a compliment,

903
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,804
because otherwise, I would 
probably have taken them all out.

904
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:25,819
I am not at all 
disappointed with my game.

905
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:28,583
But I'm upset that I'm 
not with Taylor anymore.

906
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,922
We will probably be 
reunited one day.

907
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,459
But not for a while.
