be you that goes home tonight?

413
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:45,522

414
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,140

you know,

Let me compete. Let me do it."

417
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:53,718
But, like, once you
get further down the road,

418
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:56,757
the-the deterioration
starts to take a toll on you.

419
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:58,302
Like, we're all deteriorated.
We're beat up.

420

We're all just a little hungry.

421
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:01,095
And if it is us tonight,
it's us tonight,

422
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,657
but we're ready
to give up our spots

bit more food in our stomachs.

a big blindside tonight.

669
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:37,026
- They're down on numbers.
- Uh-huh.

670
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:38,277
SAMI:
We're good.

671
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:39,379
I'm telling you...

672
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:42,143
<i>You also have to be careful,</i>

673
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:44,171
<i>because you got
to move more in silence</i>

674
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:47,065
<i>to make these bigger-scale
moves. But I think</i>

675
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:50,312
getting out Ryan
would make the damage control,

676
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,413
<i>with that group that
I just ditched, a lot easier.</i>

677
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:55,167
<i>He's not really
making tight bonds</i>

678
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,205
<i>with anybody,
except for the fish.</i>

679
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,280
<i>Ryan loves the fish,
and the fish love Ryan.</i>

680
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:02,755
How do you feel about that?

681
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,233
I need to ask you
a serious question.

682
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,615
Okay.

683
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:09,624
What would you think
if we flipped it on to Ryan?

684
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:13,338
Because I know that
that's-that's in that seven,

685
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:14,928
and I don't want
to make it seem like

686
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,854
- I'm trying to
break off that already, right?
- Mm-hmm.

687
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:19,166
You know, at this point,
it's an individual game.

688
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:20,825
Ryan is a big threat.

689
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:23,026
Even though he's Coco, that
doesn't matter to me, you know?

690
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:24,348
You're serious
about that, right?

691
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:26,820
<i>KARLA: I'm excited about
possibly blindsiding Ryan</i>

692
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:28,412
<i>because it's a great move,</i>

693
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,097
it's a big move. We get a guy
out, we get a strong guy out,

694
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:34,066
<i>but that might be questionable
for some of the people</i>

695
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,552
<i>in my alliance, in the seven.</i>

696
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:36,995
We need to get Ryan out.

697
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:42,302
- I know you are.
- I'm-I'm rocking out
whatever you want to do.

698
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:43,682
<i>KARLA:
I love the kid,
but he doesn't...</i>

699
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:46,174
Where's he at right now?
He's fishing.

700
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:48,395
He's been gone for a few hours,
bro. Like, strategize,

701
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:50,788
<i>right?
Like, we finally have rice.</i>

702
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:53,236
<i>I don't care about your fish.</i>

703
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:55,034
Aah! Freaking spines.

704
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:56,407
They're in my pockets.

705
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:58,097
[groans]

706
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,371
- I'm with you. Yes.
- I'm with you.
I'm with you, too.

707
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:00,413
All right.

708
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:01,837
- All right, sounds good.
- Jesse!

709
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,336
Would we be down
to go with Ryan?

710
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:04,898
I-I mean, I'd be down.

711
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,690
I'd be down, bro.
I mean, he's...

712
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:08,863
I don't think
Cass likes him very much.

713
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:12,904
Like, I feel
like we could do damage.

714
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,210
- Yeah.
- And I know
Ryan has it out for me.

715
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,970
I mean, I don't want you to go.

716
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:19,338
- Yeah.
- So for my game,
I would say Ryan goes.

717
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:21,788
- I-I've wanted to get Ryan out
for a long time.
- Yeah.

718
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,820
- Well, he's been out
to get you for a long time.
- Yes.

719
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:25,762
<i>JEANINE:
I know that
I'm on the chopping block,</i>

720
00:30:25,862 --> 00:30:27,142
<i>but I'm not willing to bargain.</i>

721
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:29,481
I'm not willing
to succumb to the majority.

722
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:32,715
Okay. Yeah. Done.

723
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:35,617
Hopefully he can catch
some nice, beautiful fish.

724
00:30:35,724 --> 00:30:37,284
- Before he goes?
- JAMES: Yes.

725
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:40,279
<i>JEANINE:
I need to secure
some sort of shift in the game.</i>

726
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:44,169
There are enough people here
and enough voices that we could

727
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,615
<i>work together and
we'll all just vote Ryan out.</i>

728
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:49,454
If it's Jeanine, you can tell
me, and I won't say anymore.

729
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,440
- JAMES: We're voting Ryan,
and it is what it is.
- Okay. Cool.

730
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,889
- Just got to, you know...
- OWEN: Yeah.

731
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,591
JAMES:
This is a great time.

732
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,209
<i>OWEN:
It seems like
everyone's on board.</i>

733
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,140
So, were you still
thinking Ryan?

734
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:02,691
SAMI:
I think that could work.

735
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,383
I think it could be pulled off.

736
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,242
CODY:
To me, this is
a very obvious one.

737
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:14,371
JAMES:
But right now, it's like,
you take the numbers,

738
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:16,033
you use the numbers
that you have.

739
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:18,897
The only question, does Jeanine
have anything up her sleeve?

740
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,970
I'm just saying we made a plan.

741
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:23,199
- JAMES: Let's stick to it.
- I think she's scary.
I really think she's scary.

742
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:24,451
I agree with Cody.

743
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,481
<i>So the more
I think about the vote,</i>

744
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,906
the devil you know is better
than the devil you don't know.

745
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,546
<i>And the thing about
sacrificing Ryan tonight,</i>

746
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,785
Ryan's a vote with me,
as of right now,

747
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:36,716
<i>and he has trusted me,
as of right now.</i>

748
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,793
I don't know.

749
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:40,820
I want to make everybody
in our seven feel comfortable.

750
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:42,482
She's not a big threat.

751
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:44,785
I just feel like that's a vote
we could always do later.

752
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:47,897
I think we need to get out more
immediate threats right now.

753
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
Who are you wanting? You want
to take these, like, big...

754
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,785
- Just because you want them
to be, like, competitors?
- I don't.

755
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:54,857
I just don't...

756
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:00,509
Does it not frustrate you to see
the girls picked off one by one?

757
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,661
Mm-hmm.

758
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:06,544
There are people here that are
strong, yes, but also athletic.

759
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:09,026
- Like...
- But J-Jeanine may be athletic.

760
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,067
Just never mind.
It doesn't, it doesn't matter.

761
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:13,026
- I feel like this conversation
isn't getting anywhere.
- JAMES: No, it's cool.

762
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:14,718
<i>CASSIDY:
I want to get
my revenge on Ryan.</i>

763
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:16,927
<i>He's burned me in the past
and tried to vote for me,</i>

764
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:20,074
so he's proven that
I can't fully trust him. He also

765
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,592
<i>is a threat in challenges.</i>

766
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,789
21!

767
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,026
CODY:
All right, dude.

768
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:25,757
Wow.

769
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,371
<i>CASSIDY:
And voting out a guy right now</i>

770
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:30,103
would allow the women to gain
a little bit of momentum

771
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,966
<i>and have a little bit stronger
of numbers going forward.</i>

772
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:34,337
<i>I'm tired
of seeing women go home.</i>

773
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,719
<i>I know that's
nobody's intention,</i>

774
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:37,137
<i>but it's frustrating to me.</i>

775
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:39,481
We need to...
take control of this.

776
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:40,786
I know.

777
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,268
<i>CASSIDY:
It seems like Ryan and Jeanine,</i>

778
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,682
<i>everyone could agree
on one or the other,</i>

779
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:45,764
<i>but I don't think
Ryan would have my back</i>

780
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:47,172
<i>more than Jeanine.</i>

781
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:49,785
I am truly a ship
looking for safe harbor.

782
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:51,509
I just want to know what's
going on with the majority,

783
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,992
- so that I write
the right stuff.
- We-we still don't know, even.

784
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,414
<i>CASSIDY:
Everyone seems scared</i>

785
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,137
<i>of being on
the wrong side of the votes.</i>

786
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,820
<i>If there's, like,
a unanimous decision on</i>

787
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:01,482
one or the other, it's like,
maybe we should just go with it

788
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:02,716
<i>instead of
trying to rock the boat.</i>

789
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:04,208
They told me Ryan, too.

790
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,900
Is this actually... Is...

791
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,100
I don't know, Jeanine.

792
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:09,096
No, no, no, no, no, no.

793
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,066
I might actually
have to trust James.

794

<i>CASSIDY:
But I'm ready
to fight for my game,</i>

795
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:14,968
<i>so sometimes

796
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:16,898
Like, this is a cutthroat game.

♪ ♪

798
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,310
♪ ♪

799
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:47,413
PROBST:
All right, let's start
with a big topic.

800
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:51,787
Every season of <i>Survivor</i>
has a unique social contract

801
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,166
that is established,

802
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,615
designed, built
and executed by the players.

803
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:58,834
You all decide,
"Okay, here are the rules."

804
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:01,451
So, Gabler,
does this group have a sense

805
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:04,141
of what the established
social contract is?

806
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,311
GABLER:
I think so, Jeff.

807
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:08,103
It's been a relationship game,

808
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:10,446
and when you step
outside of that, especially

809
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,544
if you're starting to get
too aggressive with gameplay,

810
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:13,906
you kind of
get cracked into line.

811
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,380
So it has to be subtle.

812
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:17,972
And with every Tribal Council,
we learn a lot more

813
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:19,758
about those social constructs

814
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:22,622
and those borders and
where they're gonna be crossed.

815
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:25,384
Karla, do you agree
with Gabler's assessment?

816
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,762
I do agree that
there is some subtlety,

817
00:34:27,862 --> 00:34:30,552
but at the same time, you can't
be subtle the entire time.

818
00:34:30,655 --> 00:34:31,925
You know? Like,

819
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,337
how will people know
what moves you're making?

820
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:35,929
How will the jury
know who to vote for?

821
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,904
Ryan, does this
line up with the way

822
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,380
you're seeing the gameplay?

823
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:41,832
I think, this season,
we're comfortable enough to say,

824
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:44,521
"Hey, let's slow down, and
we'll get to playing the game."

825
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,240
But right now, a lot of people

826
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,524
are trying to step back
and enjoy what's around them

827
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
and enjoy the experience
they're having.

828
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,624
So, Owen,
that begs the question,

829
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,624
are people staying in line
because you all

830
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,414
actually share
the same philosophy?

831
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:59,517
Or is the player saying,

832
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,830
"I'm reading the room.
I need to just lay low"?

833
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,931
I think, truthfully,
it's more of the latter.

834
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:07,284
I don't think all of us are
out swimming for three hours

835
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:09,519
the way Ryan is, necessarily.
- [laughter]

836
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,240
But foolishly,
last Tribal Council,

837
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,664
I tried jumping
in front of Dwight

838
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:14,958
from getting run over
by the bus.

839
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,310
So now, at this point, I just,

840
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:19,593
I don't care if I'm in
the wayback seat of the bus.

841
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:21,659
I don't care
if I'm sitting anywhere.

842
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:24,028
Terrible seat,
gum under the seat, whatever,

843
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:26,207
I just want
to be on the bus this time.

844
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,860
SAMI:
But at the same time, the last
two people that went home

845
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:30,475
had no idea
they were going home.

846
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,376
And so, there's a lot of game

847
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:34,322
being played, a lot
of conversations being had.

848
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:36,413
Everybody that's sitting here
is playing this game.

849
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,717
Everybody's just playing
it a little bit differently.

850
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:41,167
Cassidy, do you like
the way this game is playing?

851
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:43,095
CASSIDY:
Yeah, I mean, for me,

852
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,889
my gameplay is
maybe a little bit more subtle,

853
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:47,233
but that doesn't mean that I'm
not making big moves, you know?

854
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:49,335
It's just about
keeping trust with the people

855
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:50,718
that I want to work with.

856
00:35:50,827 --> 00:35:51,947
PROBST:
How about you, James?

857
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:54,004
Last Tribal,
there were a lot of lines

858
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:55,413
that may have been drawn,

859
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,687
but each day
a new line can be drawn,

860
00:35:57,793 --> 00:35:59,453
and you're trying to make sure

861
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,691
that you're drawing the proper
line for you to move forward.

862
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,483
PROBST:
Jeanine, James just said it.

863
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:07,516
The thing that
really complicates

864
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,690
these <i>Survivor</i> societies
is that they're fluid.

865
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,453
So how do you play this game
knowing that what was

866
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,001
true yesterday,
or even this morning,

867
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:19,593
may not be true
right now, this evening?

868
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:22,139
JEANINE:
Yeah. Like we've all
been talking about,

869
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:23,901
there has been
a culture established,

870
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,410
but just as much as
it was easy for us to all

871
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,897
kind of opt into that culture,
it could change and shift.

872
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,030
And you have to understand
when that's happening

873
00:36:32,137 --> 00:36:33,377
and go with the momentum there.

874
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,902
PROBST:
Gabler, what do you do

875
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,450
when you talk to two people,
and they say, "Plan A,"

876
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:38,958
and you talk to two more people,
and they go,

877
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,340
"No, no, we're doing plan B."

878
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,828
Oh, well, that's...
that was my day.

879
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:45,031
I mean, it's been
plan A, plan B,

880
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:47,337
plan A for sure, back to B.

881
00:36:47,448 --> 00:36:49,208
It's bounced around
a little bit.

882
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,682
So, yeah, tonight's
gonna be interesting.

883
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:52,664
I think it's gonna
put a little bit more

884
00:36:52,758 --> 00:36:54,378
into focus for tomorrow.

885
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,722
PROBST:
Cody, when you feel comfortable,

886
00:36:56,827 --> 00:37:00,407
does that make you more nervous
that you're feeling comfortable?

887
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:02,077
I get more nervous
when I'm comfortable.

888
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:03,902
And, for example,
when we got back today,

889
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm thinking,
we're starting the rice.

890
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:07,137
Get the pot on there, let's eat.

891
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,141
And I'm sitting by the firepit,

892
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:10,889
and I look around,
and there's nobody around.

893
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:12,992
I'm going, "What, do I have
to go herd cats out here?"

894
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:14,864
I thought we were
gonna smash some rice

895
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:16,578
- and then
go have our conversations.
- [chuckles]

896
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,240
I was trying to talk to people
quick, so I can go out and fish.

897
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:22,794
- So, we...
- He caught 22 fish today.

898
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:24,516
- 22 fish. 21 fish today.
- 21.

899
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,860
21?

900
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:27,995
That's a lot of fish.

901
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:29,973
RYAN:
I'm still not 100% comfortable.

902
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:31,898
I felt, you know,
I'm gonna try my luck

903
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,380
with the waters,
and if I bring back a bounty,

904
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,312
then they'll
keep me in the game.

905
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:38,313
Jeanine, were you
comfortable today?

906
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:39,793
No, I think it's pretty obvious.

907
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:42,026
There were lines
drawn at last Tribal,

908
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:44,447
and I was not
in the majority vote.

909
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:47,901
And so I'm-I'm definitely
not comfortable tonight.

910
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,550
So what did you do today?
Ryan went fishing.

911
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:52,755
JEANINE:
For me, it was really just about

912
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,002
trying to connect
with as many people as possible

913
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:57,371
and lean on the relationships
that I think I can out here.

914
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:59,073
But there's never any way

915
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:01,172
to tell if someone's
telling you the truth.

916
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:03,715
You really just
have to trust your gut.

917
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:06,587
CODY:
You know, this game,
I learned today, Jeff,

918
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,659
it's a game of centimeters,
or even less.

919
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:10,408
And those same centimeters

920
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:12,407
don't only carry over
into the challenges,

921
00:38:12,517 --> 00:38:15,547
but they also carry into
the conversations that we have.

922
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:18,205
And just
misinterpreting one word,

923
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,900
- Wow.
- one body posture, can change
the whole outcome as well.

924
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,970
So I-I don't know
where I'm going with this,

925
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,618
at the end of the day,
but it's...

926
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:29,144
Well, I was tracking every
bit of it, and it scares me.

927
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:33,281
So, Sami, the vibe of the tribe
is pretty clear.

928
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,589
The group is saying, "Listen,

929
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:36,999
"we have agreed
to play a certain way.

930
00:38:37,103 --> 00:38:40,103
"Make your moves quietly.
Be respectful of time.

931
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:41,756
He wants to fish,
let him do it."

932
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,578
And what I would be thinking
as a player is,

933
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,210
"What do I do
other than just trust?"

934
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,280
SAMI:
I feel like we're
all talking about trust,

935
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:50,339
and it's, like,
such a fishy word.

936
00:38:50,448 --> 00:38:52,098
Like, it's
a whole bunch of nonsense.

937
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,546
It's a crock of crap at this
point, you know what I mean?

938
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:57,615
Like, these rules
are being curved.

939
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:00,174
They're being amended
all the time.

940
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:02,405
And I think it's gonna
continue to be that way.

941
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:04,587
I think that
it's gonna be a damn civil war.

942
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:07,239
The rules are gonna
be outright broken all around,

943
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,284
and it's gonna
be crazy chaos around here.
