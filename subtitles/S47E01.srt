every season of<i> Survivor</i>
starts the same way,

70
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,909
with the forming
of a new community.

71
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,377
That's what's happening
right now. Take a look around.

72
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,113
This is gonna be your community

73
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,616
for the next 26 days.

74
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,152
And the reason community has

75
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,120
always been the foundation

76
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,590
of this social experiment
we've been doing

77
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,726
for 24 years is because humans
have always

78
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,028
craved community.

79
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,698
And I get it. If you're at home
watching<i> Survivor,</i>

80
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,000
you could say
"Ah, it doesn't fully jibe.

81
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,135
"I mean, they're not
really abandoned.

82

That's true.

83
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,407
There are cameras
shooting you right now.

84
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,343
But what you all
are going to experience

85
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,378
because you're here is that

86
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,280
when you're tired
and you're hungry

87
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,451
or you feel left out,
it's gonna feel very real

88
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,354
because you're gonna
have those same cravings

89
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,122
for community.

90
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,557
And what truly
sets<i> Survivor</i> apart

91
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:21,327
from any other social experiment
like this

92
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,263
is the game
that sits on top of it,

93
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,433
a game that's
played with humans.

94
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,937
The same humans you are
forming your community with

95
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,738
are your adversaries.

96
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,208
So you have to build a community

97
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,944
with people you can rely on
while you vote them out

98
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,445
and then
after you vote them out,

99
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,047
you go back to them
and try to persuade them

100
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,583
to give you the vote
for the million dollars.

101
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,420
How do you pull off
that magic trick?

102
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,323
So let's see if we can solidify
your community a little bit

103
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,358
by giving you an identity
with a tribe name.

104
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,461

138
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,271
So unpopular because
I did not have an identity,

139
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,107
and I kept trying
different things.

140
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,843

Grateful Dead T-shirts

141
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,311

that I just have to be myself,

146
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,021

every episode you say,
"Apply to be on<i> Survivor."</i>

162
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,586
And you have this idea

00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,522
of what you would play like

164
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,890

170
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,271

171
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,806
(laughing)

172
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,142
Well, shall we get

-(all voicing assent)
-PROBST: All right.

174
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,550
Your first test as new tribes

175
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,885
is waiting for you
in the jungle.

Oh, my God.

180
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,828
<i>ANDY: Jeff</i>

<i>turns a corner</i>
<i>and takes us to...</i>

183
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,701
<i>It could only be described</i>

184
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,503
as, like, a gladiator's arena.

185
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,606
<i>Look, I've seen a lot</i>
<i>of</i> Survivor.

186
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,842
<i>There are opening challenges,</i>

187
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,510
<i>but this one</i>
<i>really takes the cake</i>

188
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,212
<i>in terms of the grandness.</i>

189
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,582
<i>And the pressure is on.</i>
<i>Like, you have to perform</i>

190
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,684
or you're gonna
be in trouble immediately.

191
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,921
All right. Let's get to your
first challenge as new tribes.

192
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,957
Here's how it works.

193
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,125
<i>Two players from each tribe</i>

194
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,062
<i>are gonna crawl</i>
<i>under a muddy net.</i>

195
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,232
<i>You're gonna race</i>
<i>into the jungle...</i>

196
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,604
<i>...and retrieve</i>
<i>two puzzle pieces</i>

197
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,039
<i>from one of three</i>
<i>different obstacles.</i>

198
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,376
<i>Then you race back,</i>
<i>the next pair goes.</i>

199
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,410
<i>Once you have all six pieces,</i>

200
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,580
<i>two tribe members</i>
<i>will use those pieces</i>

201
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,381
<i>to solve a rectangular puzzle.</i>

202
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,217
<i>The first tribe to finish</i>

203
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,919
earns their camp supplies.

204
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,386
You know the drill.

205
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,390
It's not much--
a pot, a machete and a flint--

206
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,125
but out here, it's everything,

207
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,094
and will provide
a massive head start.

208
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,065
The two losing tribes will have
to try to earn it another way.

209
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,903
-Make sense? All right,
-Yup.

210
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,271
give everybody a minute
to strategize,

211
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,839
we'll get started.

212
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,809
-All right.
-SUE: Let's go.

213

00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,753
<i>Survivor</i> is really
my mom's and I thing.

507
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,622
Now, see, it's me and Chelsea's.
Same thing, so you get it.

508
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,392
<i>She's so excited,</i>
<i>and that's like my daughter,</i>

509
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,627
so, it's cool.
Like, there's something there.

510
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,132
Yeah.

511
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,467
Uh, what do you mean?

512
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,568
You're the main person
that I feel, like,

513
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,670
-I've got, like...
-Oh, good.

514
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,806
-Oh, no, no, no. Exact opposite.
-Okay.

515
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,379
<i>At my age, I thought for sure</i>

516
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,981
<i>I would be the very bottom.</i>

517
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,717
<i>But now I feel</i>
<i>like Caroline and Gabe--</i>

518
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,886
<i>they're-they're my number ones,</i>

519
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,622
<i>and so I'm feeling good with it.</i>
<i>Now we're gonna</i>

520
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,090
be a force
to be reckoned with.

521
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,463
<i>KISHAN:</i>
<i>All right. We're just</i>
<i>organizing them from, like,</i>

522
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,798
-Biggest to smallest.
-biggest to smallest so that

523
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,566
it's, like, a nice incline.

524
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,767
-I think this one over here...
-This one's got some girth.

525
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,269
Yeah.
So, let's move this one.

526
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:19,538
-Yep.
<i>-KISHAN: Losing that</i>
<i>first challenge--</i>

527
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,740
<i>it sucks.</i>
<i>We're not the tallest tribe.</i>

528
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,342
<i>We didn't look to be</i>
<i>the strongest, but Lava--</i>

529
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,609
<i>we're-we're resourceful.</i>

530
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,579
We just have to trust
our instincts and kind of

531
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,915
fall back onto our training
and our, like, gut.

532
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,349
<i>So, that's what we're doing.</i>

533
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,320
Yeah! Like...

534
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,823
<i>KISHAN:</i>
<i>I'm an emergency room doctor.</i>

535
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:39,023
I love the chaos.

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,792
TEENY:
I think it's a dead hermit crab.

537
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,060
We could eat it.

538
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,663
Oh... Doctor.

539
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,398

<i>by the unknown,</i>

541
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,102
and I'm so ready for that,
'cause that's what I do

542
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,904
every single day for a living,
and I'm really good at it,

543
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,407

on<i> Survivor,</i> too.

544
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,609
TEENY:
Can you guys tell me,
on a scale of one to ten,

545
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,712
how dweeby
my first buff look was?

546
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,547
It was some variation of this

547
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,450
for all of the opening events
of the day.

548
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,520
Where are you gonna place it?
Give it to me straight.

549

-SOL: You want it straight?
-TEENY: Yeah.

550
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,323
SOL:
It's at, like,
a four and a half.

-(all laughing)
-(indistinct chatter)

552
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,328
<i>TEENY:</i>
<i>Playing</i> Survivor<i> is about</i>

553
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,096
the social relationships
you make.

554
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,832
<i>In school, the one thing</i>
<i>that I really excelled at</i>

555
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,568
<i>was being able to make friends</i>
<i>and talk to people.</i>

556
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,838
<i>And so I'm gonna</i>
<i>play this game by being</i>

557

<i>every single person's</i>
<i>number one.</i>

558
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,981
(laughing): Exac...

559
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,950
<i>Keyshawn and I bonded</i>
<i>almost immediately.</i>

560
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,218
<i>So, I mean, he's an ER doctor.</i>

561
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,888
<i>He has an ability</i>
<i>to work under pressure.</i>

562
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,824
And I feel like he's a bit more
introverted to my extrovert,

563
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,960
so I felt like he was
a cool yin to my yang.

564
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,665
I think she's
got the perfect vibe.

565

-Yes.
-I think it's gonna be great.

What am I looking for?

599
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,992
<i>So, when I uncovered the clue</i>

600
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,761
<i>and saw that it was a picture,</i>
<i>I realized</i>

601
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,262
<i>this is my guide.</i>

602
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,897

<i>to find the key.</i>
<i>It's gonna look</i>

604

identical.

00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,071
Okay.<i> Agua.</i>

606
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:15,907
<i>I look at this map.</i>
<i>I see the first X,</i>

607
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,609
<i>and it's this huge rock face</i>
<i>that is near.</i>

608
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,611
<i>So I'm thinking,</i>
<i>"Just look for a big rock face.</i>

609
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,845
<i>I'll find the X."</i>

610
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,013
I look around-- there's, like,
eight rock faces.

611
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,317
So, everything looks
exactly the same.

612
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,619
This is this rock.

613
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,722
It's saying "between two rocks."

614
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,258
Ah, there it is.
That's what I'm looking for.

615
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,459
That's it.

616
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,963
(quietly): Yes!

617
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,532
<i>So, when I got my first key,</i>
<i>that gives me the clue</i>

618
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,034
<i>to be able</i>
<i>to find that second key.</i>

619
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,036
A mountain of rocks.

620
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,474
Okay.
This a mountain of rocks?

621
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,209
Oh.

622
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,112
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes. Let's...

623
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,914
<i>I get that first key</i>
<i>and I'm hyped.</i>

624
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,116

628
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,463
<i>Perfect. I found my second key</i>
<i>and I feel like</i>

629
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,031
I'm cooking, we're going,

630
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,799
<i>I have it.</i>

Come on, bro.

633
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,744
It has to be over here.

634
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,247
Let's see if it's right here.

635
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,849
Here it is.

636
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:40,325
<i>I never would have thought that</i>

637
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,727
<i>the final key was in the ocean.</i>

638
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,162
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>Whoever finds</i>

639
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,997
the fourth key wins.

640
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,101
See, thi-this is the tree.

641
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,771
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

642
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,806
<i>Okay, that's two keys.</i>
<i>I'm hyping</i>

643
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,474
<i>myself up like, "They don't</i>
<i>know who they messing with."</i>

644
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,476
All right.
Three trees by theirselves.

645
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,844
Come on, T.

646
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,814
I don't even know
how to get back down.

647
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,482
I don't even remember
where the path was.

648
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,018
How am I--
I'm lost. I'm lost.

649
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,320
Let's go. Let's go.
Now I'm getting my rhythm.

650
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,321
Give me my money.

651
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,123
Uh-oh.
Hold up.

652
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,792
In the ... ocean is insane.

653
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,061
Well, got to go back down, then.

654
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,328
(grunts)

655
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,696
Oh, my God, dude,
where is the exit?

656
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:20,965
<i>The forest is so dense.</i>

657
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,267
<i>And I'm like, "You know what,</i>

658
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,335
"forget that path.
Make your own path,

659
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,869

your entire life."

660
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:28,006
I am about
to muscle through this.

661
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,340
Oh! (whoops)

662
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,276
<i>I don't care what I hit.</i>
<i>I'm making my own path</i>

<i>through this brush</i>
<i>and I'm figuring it out.</i>

664
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,820
Where is this thing?

665
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,257
This is the path?
No, this is just where I was.

666
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,659
<i>I can't believe being lost</i>

667
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,227
is what's setting me back.

668
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,229
It's to where
I can't get out of here

669
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,064
because I'm lost?

670
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,232
Where?

01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,284
safe tonight at Tribal Council,

1499
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,753
sending Gata to Tribal,

1500
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,189
where somebody
will be the first person

1501
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,792
voted out of<i> Survivor</i> 47.

1502
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:24,093
SIERRA:
Don't be sorry.

1503
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,294
(indistinct chatter)

1504
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,070
-Oh, you're in good hands.
-I was...

1505
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,306
PROBST: No.

1506
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,541
Dude, you're in the game, still.

1507
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,177
-Okay. Okay.
-Stop. Okay, I'm with you, okay?

1508
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,578
-SIERRA: You're good, Andy.
-I didn't...

1509
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,080
-Your tribe lost.
-Yeah.

1510
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,681
-So you are going to Tribal.
-Yeah.

1511
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:47,883
But you're still in the game.
There's still a lot of game.

1512
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,285
You're overheated.

1513
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,087
-And we're in no rush. Okay?
-ANDY: Yeah.

1514
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:52,355
You don't have
to worry about anything.

1515
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,357
-This is part of<i> Survivor.</i>
-ANDY: Yeah.

1516
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,092
-PROBST: We got you.
-ANDY: Okay, okay.

1517
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,493
-ANDY: Thank you.
-PROBST: Yeah. Just sit here

1518
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,928
until you're good.

1519
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:01,998
Okay, but they
haven't voted you out.

1520
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,466
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yup.
-Right?

1521
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,901
Yup. I get it.

1522
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:11,207
-Okay. I'm gonna
let you cool down.
-Okay.

1523
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,341
-Not talk.
-Yeah.

1524
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,776
We'll go when
you're ready, okay?

1525
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,478
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay. All right.

1526
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,114
-All right, love you, Jeff.
-Hey, I love you, Andy.

1527
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,683
He's good.
We're just giving him space.

1528
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,084
-It's just... He's good.
-(applause)

1529
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,520
-RACHEL: All right, Andy.
-SIERRA: Come on, Andy.

1530
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,092
MAN:
All right, good. Good timing.

1531
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,528
No. He's up, he's up, he's up,
he's up, he's up, he's up.

1532
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:41,470
All right.
Andy is okay.

1533
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,105
(whooping, cheering)

1534
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,507
Head back to Gata.

1535
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:45,908
GABE:
Attaboy.

1536
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,611
-(whooping)
-KISHAN: Yes, Andy.

1537
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,014
So, Andy, give
everybody else the update.

1538
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:54,016
I was overheated.
I'm okay now.

1539
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,351
-PROBST: Okay.
-I'm okay now.

1540
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,585
-I'm cooled down.
-PROBST: All right. All right.

1541
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:57,820
-You feel all right?
-Yeah.

1542
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,522
Okay.
You seem emotional.

1543
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:01,824
-Yeah.
-What's the emotion?

1544
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,359
I was fighting for my life.

1545
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:05,828
I'm on the bottom.

1546
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,131
I see it in their eyes
when

1547
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,833
they don't...
I crack open a coconut

1548
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,201
and they didn't cheer for me.

1549
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:15,604
They cheered for Jon,
and they... And then I-I...

1550
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,773
They don't like me.
I don't think.

1551
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,308
-That's not true.
-That's not true.
-Okay. Okay.

1552
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,943
-ANIKA: Andy, Andy.
-ANDY: Okay.

1553
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,112
-I know it's the game.
I'm not...
-It's in your head.

1554
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:24,480
PROBST:
So, Andy, you haven't even

1555
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,482
-gone back to camp
to strategize,
-ANDY: No.

1556
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,616
much less get to Tribal,

1557
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,819
-where all kinds
of things happen.
-No.

1558
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,455
PROBST:
And it sounds like
you're conceding defeat.

1559
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,091
No, no, no, no.
I'm a strategist.

1560
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,226
I was gonna try everything.

1561
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:40,463
My best friend out here is Jon.

1562
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:44,600
And as they were
finishing the puzzle,

1563
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,068
I was...

1564
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:48,704
...thinking I was gonna

1565
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,006
throw him under the bus
to try to stay.

1566
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:53,042
Just, I just want
to play the game.

1567
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,910
-(quiet murmuring)
-Um...

1568
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:58,347
-(quietly): Wow.
-ANDY: And then, I, like, uh,

1569
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,349
stopped seeing straight.
(chuckles)

1570
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,186
And I just want to,
you know, be in the game.

1571
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,889
PROBST:
So, Andy, what's great
about<i> Survivor--</i>

1572
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,190
you might be right.

1573
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,759
It might be
a five-O vote tonight.

1574
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,494
-Yeah.
-PROBST: You might be wrong.

1575
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,295
-Yeah.
-PROBST: You don't know.

1576
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,864
You fight until
I snuff your torch.

1577
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,298
That goes for everybody.

1578
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,435
You're all gonna feel down.
He's just the first.

1579
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,203
This is why you're out here.

1580
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,972
You want something soft,
pick another show,

1581
01:07:23,038 --> 01:07:26,075
'cause you are on<i> Survivor.</i>

1582
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:27,243
That's a badge of honor,

1583
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,045
-Andy.
-(Sue whoops) Yeah.

1584
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,247
Go, Andy.

1585
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:34,817
PROBST:
All right,
let's get to the results,

1586
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,186
'cause there is some
positivity out here,

1587
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:39,688
starting with Lavo
in the middle. Congratulations.

1588
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,791
-Yes.
-(whooping)

1589
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,893
CAROLINE:
Good job, guys.

1590
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,762
PROBST:
You are safe tonight.

1591
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,999
Waiting for you back at camp--
that nice<i> Survivor</i> tool kit,

1592
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:51,934
which will improve
your living conditions.

1593
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,235
-Yes, sir.
-CAROLINE: Good job, guys.

1594
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:56,839
Tuku, it took some work,
but you got it.

1595
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,941
That's all that matters.

1596
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:00,342
-You're safe.
-That's all of us.
This is all of us.

1597
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,944
This is all of us.

1598
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,613
Waiting for you back at camp--
a smaller tool kit.

1599
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,449
Tuka, Lavo, grab your stuff.

1600
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,384
Head out.
Enjoy the night off.

1601
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:09,718
Congratulations.

1602
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,187
-There he is.
-PROBST: Lavo,

1603
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,388
before you leave,

1604
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,557
-you get your flint.
-(cheering)

1605
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,226
We got fire tonight, baby!
Let's go.

1606
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,761
Come on.

1607
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,729
PROBST:
All right, so, Gata.

1608
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,564
What is happening right now?

1609
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:25,301
Jon, can you give
any perspective?

1610
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,970
How does Andy's confession

1611
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,805
impact anything?

1612
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,474
JON:
Uh, what I take from Andy--

1613
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,443
uh, previewing a trip for me

1614
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,445
under a bus--

1615
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,014
is... is that he is wrestling

1616
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,784
with the fact
that he wants to stay

1617
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,819
and he values
the relationships he's building.

1618
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,255
But he knows that
in a situation like this,

1619
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,424
you may have to turn
on people you care about.

1620
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:52,027
PROBST:
All right, Gata,
Tribal Council tonight.

1621
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:53,696
Somebody from Gata
will be the first person

1622
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:55,798
voted out of<i> Survivor</i> 47.

1623
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,701
And as a penalty for losing--
sorry for you--

1624
01:08:58,767 --> 01:08:59,902
I'm gonna take your flint.

1625
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,671
Thank you, Rachel.

1626
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,974
You'll have a chance to win
it back in the next challenge.

1627
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,842
Grab your stuff, head out. See
you tonight at Tribal Council.

1628

But I've fully
gathered my thoughts now.

1654
01:10:27,622 --> 01:10:30,993
<i>Survivor</i> is a game of paranoia.

It's extremely possible that
I was just susceptible to it.

01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,215
Which makes me nervous.

1663
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,851
All of us aren't
gonna be 100% out here.

1664
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,320
<i>That's the whole entire point</i>
<i>of the game.</i>

1665
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:01,090
<i>If you're gonna have outbursts</i>
<i>like this on day three--</i>

1666
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,359
like, that is a huge concern.

1667
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,593
I like all of you a lot.

1668
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,894
And so...

1669
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,162
-I appreciate that.
-RACHEL (laughs): Yes.

1670
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:09,497
SIERRA:
And, Andy, know how much

1671
01:11:09,564 --> 01:11:11,133
you contributed to this tribe.

1672
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,402
You've done beyond
the coconut cutting.

1673
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:16,171
-The bamboo, our shelter
where we're sleeping,
-And challenges.

1674
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,207
challenges, your strength.
You provided...

1675
01:11:18,273 --> 01:11:19,908
-ANIKA: Such an asset.
-such an asset.

1676
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,845
<i>JON:</i>
<i>Andy is messy. That was messy.</i>

1677
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:25,014
I don't know that I've seen
something like that before.

1678
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,549
<i>And because of how</i>
<i>it all went down, like,</i>

1679
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,619
<i>you would think that</i>
<i>they're going for Andy, but</i>

1680
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,688
<i>I'm a little bit paranoid</i>
<i>because</i>

1681
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,256
<i>I feel like I have been</i>
<i>struggling to fit in,</i>

1682
01:11:35,323 --> 01:11:37,226
<i>and that makes me nervous.</i>

1683
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:38,627
<i>So I'm gonna go feel it out.</i>

1684
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:40,863
ANIKA:
Do you want to talk about Andy?

1685
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,598
JON:
Yeah. I'm a little frustrated

1686
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:43,999
because, like...

1687
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,768
-He called you out.
-I know.
-He called me out.

1688
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,536
And it's like, "Hey, man,

1689
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:50,439
"like, we've-we've been
talking for two days.

1690
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,174
I genuinely, really like you."

1691
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,842
This is somebody that I was,
like, beginning to think, like,

1692
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,544
"Oh, this is a person
that could play with.

1693
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,745
-I could play with them." Right?
-SIERRA: Mm-hmm.
-Right.

1694
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,981
You know, like...
And then instead, it's like,

1695
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,050
-how do I go to bat
for you right now?
-Mm-hmm.

1696
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,285
-SIERRA: I know. I understand.
-How do you
play a game with him?

1697
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:04,353
It stinks.

1698
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,654
-RACHEL: This stinks.
-It just stinks.

1699
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,755
It... So, like,
I think we need to,

1700
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,122
like, tell him it's you.

1701
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:09,258
Is that okay?
Cause I just don't know

1702
01:12:09,323 --> 01:12:10,492
that he's gonna believe

1703
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:11,827
anything else
because he already is the one

1704
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,462
that's pitted himself
against you.

1705
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:14,697
Okay.

1706
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,698
-I mean, right?
-I know, that's true.

1707
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,401
<i>JON:</i>
<i>Anika, Rachel and Sierra</i>

1708
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,236
<i>are all saying it's Andy,</i>

1709
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:22,805
but they all immediately
are like, "And we're gonna

1710
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:25,674
tell Andy it's me," which sucks.

1711
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:28,510
Uh...

1712
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,481
<i>SIERRA:</i>
<i>Bring it in.</i>

1713
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,782
We got to get to the end here.

1714
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,651
<i>What I'm hearing</i>
<i>doesn't totally make sense,</i>

1715
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,619
<i>so I'd much rather</i>
<i>try to figure out my best</i>

1716
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,388
strategic option with the votes.

1717
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,760
<i>JON: I...</i>

1718
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:47,729
-know that, like,
you had, like, a moment.
-ANDY: Yeah.

1719
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:49,564
-I want you to stay.
-I want to stay.
I want to stay, too.

1720
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,067
-I want you to stay.
-And I never was gonna
throw you under the bus.

1721
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,136
-Okay.
-And that's my...

1722
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,771
But what do you want to do?

1723
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:56,872
Anika.

1724
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,375
Anika is the person I want gone.

1725
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,210
-Okay.
-How do you feel about that?

1726
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,078
I...

1727
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,813
I would like to do it.

1728
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,814
<i>ANDY:</i>
<i>I'm patching things up with Jon,</i>

1729
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:10,452
<i>and he gives me sort of, like,</i>
<i>a lifeline for me in this game</i>

1730
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,354
<i>to get out a person</i>
<i>I actually want out,</i>

1731
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:13,689
<i>which is Anika.</i>

1732
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,157
<i>At this point, my main,</i>

1733
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,093
core priority
over everything is just

1734
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,595
fighting to stay in the game.

1735
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,997
JON: If we can turn this into
a move, I think we can turn...

1736
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,800
-Yeah. Yeah.
-like, you having that moment
on the mat

1737
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:25,901
-Yeah.
-into something.

1738
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,571
I think that Sam has

1739
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,640
a working line of communication
with Sierra.

1740
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,041
All right, let's go talk to Sam.

1741
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,744
<i>Right now, it's either</i>
<i>me or Andy.</i>

1742
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:38,981
<i>Or I can try to vote Anika.</i>

1743
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:41,116
If I'm gonna be on this show
for one episode--

1744
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,452
one glorious
and perfect episode--

1745
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,720
I'd rather go out swinging
and ha--

1746
01:13:45,787 --> 01:13:48,223
and-and making
some kind of a move

1747
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,025
rather than just
hoping for the best.

1748
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,260
I don't want
to hope for the best.

1749
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,128
I want to try
to figure something out.

1750
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:56,430
-Here's where we're at.
It's you, it's me or it's
-ANDY: Yeah.

1751
01:13:56,497 --> 01:13:58,133
-Okay.
-Anika. For tribe strength,

1752
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,334
what is Anika offering, right?

1753
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:02,571
I think you, me and Andy
vote Anika

1754
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,372
<i>-and pull someone</i>
<i>into the group.</i>
<i>-SAM: Yeah. Yes.</i>

1755
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:05,908
<i>Well, I mean, that</i>
<i>would be our option there.</i>

1756
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,476
<i>JON:</i>
<i>I think Sierra</i>
<i>will listen to you,</i>

1757
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:10,345
and I think we have to just sort
of not talk to Rachel about it.

1758
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:12,381
-Right?
-N-- Yes.

1759
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:13,881
JON:
I just also, like...

1760
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,752
Hi. Don't worry,
just going to the water well.

1761
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:17,920
You guys can keep going.

1762
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:19,121
<i>SAM:</i>
<i>Jon and Andy expect me to throw</i>

1763
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:20,389
<i>a vote on Anika tonight.</i>

1764
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:22,224
<i>Love you, Jon,</i>
<i>but I'm not doing that.</i>

1765
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,525
<i>I'm starting to think</i>

1766
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:26,295
Jon is playing hard.

1767
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:27,529
-JON: We can make this work.
-SAM: Yes.

1768
01:14:27,595 --> 01:14:29,264
-I got it, right?
-Okay. Okay, I'm-I'm gonna go.

1769
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,732
<i>He's a strategist.</i>

1770
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:34,403
<i>He's very, very smart,</i>
<i>which is dangerous for me.</i>

1771
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:36,071
<i>And Andy is strong.</i>

1772
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,872
<i>He might be able to help us win</i>

1773
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:39,174
a challenge or two.

1774
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,281
ANIKA:
I know we're at a point in the
game where we need strength, but

1775
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:47,883
will we actually
win more with Andy?

1776
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:51,019
Because he is messy and not only
in his words, but, like,

1777
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,654
-all he is is brute force,
and it's not even
-SIERRA: That's so true.

1778
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,723
-that strong a force.
<i>-SIERRA: Having somebody</i>

1779
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,258
<i>like Andy can be a liability,</i>

1780
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,594
<i>and it's somebody we definitely</i>
<i>need to worry about.</i>

1781
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,896
<i>However, I think</i>
<i>right now we need strength.</i>

1782
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:03,398
<i>I don't think these challenges</i>
<i>are going to get any easier.</i>

1783
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,734
We need some strength
and, honestly,

1784
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,236
we're not getting that from Jon.

1785
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,071
I think we need to touch base
and get on the same page.

1786
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:11,273
-Yep.
-Yeah.
-SIERRA: We have to be quick.

1787
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,708
We need strength right now.

1788
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:14,843
I think that makes sense.
Right now,

1789
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,011
I would vote Jon.

1790
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:17,679
RACHEL:
I still really worry about Andy

1791
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,982
imploding again.
Like, yesterday was a bad day,

1792
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,150
today's a bad day. He's given up
halfway through the challenge

1793
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,019
-before we even lost.
-ANIKA: Mm-hmm.

1794
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,388
I just think there's legitimate
pros and cons to both.

1795
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:27,555
If we keep Andy,

1796
01:15:27,622 --> 01:15:28,857
<i>I think he's more loyal</i>
<i>to me than he is</i>

1797
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:30,826
<i>to anybody else on our tribe.</i>

1798
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,728
<i>But I don't know that</i>
<i>that's actually a good thing</i>

1799
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:35,930
<i>because Andy is a ticking</i>
<i>time bomb and you don't know</i>

1800
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:36,932
when it's gonna explode.

1801
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,600
<i>On the other hand,</i>

1802
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,670
<i>if we keep Jon, who is</i>
<i>more even keel and levelheaded,</i>

1803
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:44,773
<i>we might lose the next</i>
<i>few immunity challenges</i>

1804
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,073
<i>without Andy's strengths.</i>

1805
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:47,910
I am genuinely torn.

1806
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:49,945
<i>Our ability as a tribe</i>

1807
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,580
<i>to make the right choice</i>
<i>is gonna</i>

1808
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:54,650
<i>decide the fate of Gata,</i>
<i>and that</i>

1809
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,218
is so scary.

1810
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,653
♪ ♪

1811
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:07,062
♪ ♪

1812
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,527
Behind each of you is a torch.
Go ahead

1813
01:16:38,593 --> 01:16:40,128
and grab a torch,

1814
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,697
dip it in and get fire.

1815
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:53,976
This is part of the ritual

1816
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,078
at Tribal Council
because in this game,

1817
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,612
fire represents your life.

1818
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,349
Fire's gone, so are you.

1819
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:02,784
And that will be the case
for one of you tonight.

1820
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:05,153
But before we get to the vote,

1821
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,455
we got a lot to talk about.

1822
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,490
It has been a roller coaster

1823
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,425
for the Gata tribe.

1824
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:11,727
Sierra, give me an idea

1825
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,295
-of camp life.
-Oh, my God, Jeff.

1826
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,497
I mean, my back
feels broken, my legs

1827
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,299
feel broken, I have bruises,
and it's been

1828
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,867
three days.
I mean, Jeff,

1829
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,003
I have the<i> Survivor 101</i> book

1830
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:22,904
at home.
I have

1831
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,973
25 coconuts in my backyard,
machetes.

1832
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,476
My neighbors definitely
have a lot of questions about

1833
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,311
who's living next door to them.

1834
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,979
But I do have to give props
to Anika. I mean,

1835
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:32,881
she definitely led the tribe
for a good bit.

1836
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,316
She had the basics

1837
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:35,851
and got us, like,
a good base start.

1838
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,753
PROBST:
Anika, walk me through that.

1839
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,588
How did you step up
to be the leader?

1840
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:42,991
So, I'm flattered
that you think that. Um,

1841
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:46,495
I had general consensus
and a general idea of

1842
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:49,965
what we should be doing,
realistically.

1843
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:54,069
-How would you
describe camp, Jon?
-JON: I think we spent

1844
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:56,171
the first three days

1845
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,539
finding commonality.

1846
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:59,573
You're doing that
because you genuinely want to.

1847
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:00,976
There are genuine connections,

1848
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,444
those are real,
you can't fake it.

1849
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,780
And even if you wanted to,
I don't think you ultimately

1850
01:18:04,845 --> 01:18:06,381
could succeed unless you were,
like, a sociopath.

1851
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:09,317
And so, yes, we're a community,
but we're also competitors.

1852
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:12,054
And I think a little bit
out of fear and trepidation,

1853
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,256
people really were reluctant
to break out

1854
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:18,126
into groups and start
having strategic conversations.

1855
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:21,363
So, a bit of a delayed start
to the strategy part?

1856
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,865
Uh... yes.

1857
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:27,269
PROBST:
All right, let's get
into the emotional part

1858
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:29,304
of the first three days, Andy,

1859
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,706
-all circling around you.
-Yeah.

1860
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:34,309
Today at the immunity challenge,

1861
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:35,944
what stood out to me

1862
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,746
were the comments you made
about your tribe.

1863
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:40,881
-Yeah.
-"Nobody noticed me
open a coconut.

1864
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:43,385
Nobody likes me.
Everybody wants me gone."

1865
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:45,620
Walk me through that
a little more.

1866
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,990
Well, I feel like

1867
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:52,294
I grew up on the outside, 100%.

1868
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,929
I never felt like I belonged,

1869
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:56,665
but coming into this experience,

1870
01:18:56,731 --> 01:18:58,233
I felt like I changed

1871
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,068
just by getting rid of all this,

1872
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,737
like, need to please people.

1873
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:04,439
PROBST:
So, you're saying,
in your recent life,

1874
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,174
-Yeah.
-just back home,

1875
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,743
you felt like you've broken out
of that feeling left out.

1876
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,146
-Yeah.
-And do you feel like
you have a community?

1877
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:14,182
An unbelievable community
has formed around me,

1878
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,951
and it did not happen overnight.

1879
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,853
It was because
I challenged myself.

1880
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,854
I kept saying yes to things.

1881
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,523
I kept putting myself
out of my comfort zone,

1882
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:25,127
and succeed or fail
based off of that.

1883
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:26,495
PROBST:
So, it's fascinating

1884
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:28,363
-that you would work so hard
-ANDY: Yeah.

1885
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:32,000
and then sign up
to take on the biggest test

1886
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:34,269
-Yeah.
-of social resiliency

1887
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:35,970
anybody could
ever volunteer for.

1888
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,974
ANDY:
But I've made myself
ready to conquer that.

1889
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,110
And now I can go show,
you know, the world, any--

1890
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:44,746
everyone in my life,
you know, how far I've come

1891
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:47,916
and how, you know,
easy it will be for me now,

1892
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,385
which is not the case,
as we can see.

1893
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:54,289
PROBST:
So, Jon, regardless
how it played out today,

1894
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:56,558
do you respect the fact
that Andy's intention

1895
01:19:56,625 --> 01:20:00,162
of coming out here was to try
to take on this social test?

1896
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:02,229
Um, did Andy have a moment?

1897
01:20:02,296 --> 01:20:03,665
People have moments.

1898
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,634
Sometimes they happen
on a beach in Fiji.

1899
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,503
People shouldn't be judged
by their worst moments,

1900
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:11,406
even if you are frustrated
that they're saying it

1901
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,609
-in front of everyone,
including Jeff.
-(laughs): Yeah.

1902
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:16,578
-Yeah, yeah.
-JON: So I don't think
any of us came away

1903
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,613
from that not being frustrated.

1904
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,081
PROBST:
So, let's talk about that.

1905
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,317
Andy, you shared
a lot of information.

1906
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:23,985
-Yeah.
-It'd be very easy to say,

1907
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:26,354
-"He's a loose cannon.
You got to get rid of him."
-Yeah.

1908
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:27,889
PROBST:
So, when you get back to camp,

1909
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,325
-what did you do?
-I want to be very, very clear,

1910
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,127
and I was clear to everyone.

1911
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,461
I think it was pretty obvious

1912
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:35,863
that there was absolutely
zero premeditation.

1913
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:39,467
That old part of me just set in
and that paranoia,

1914
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,069
and now look
at these five people

1915
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:44,773
who Andy threw under the bus.

1916
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:47,075
-You only threw one person
under of the bus.
-Well, yeah.

1917
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,176
With my words.
Yeah.

1918
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:49,978
But despite all this,

1919
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:51,979
the one thing
I absolutely cannot do

1920
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:53,881
is say that it's okay
to vote me out.

1921
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:56,551
Let's just play<i> Survivor.</i>
I will accept the result.

1922
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,154
So, Sam, what was the fallout

1923
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,189
from a strategic point of view?

1924
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,258
Because you don't want to come
back to Tribal Council again,

1925
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:07,262
and a lot of that is gonna
be harmony and tribe strength.

1926
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,264
I never had a perception of Andy

1927
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:12,834
that he was out here to do
anything other than give 100%.

1928
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,502
He fought so hard
in the challenge

1929
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:17,104
that he's passed out
on the side.

1930
01:21:17,171 --> 01:21:19,541
But then he's willing
to turn on his best friend.

1931
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:23,044
Well, that's hard for somebody
to jump into bed with.

1932
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:26,247
Rachel, can Andy
recover from today?

1933
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:28,116
I-I...

1934
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,785
I empathize with
Andy completely,

1935
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,154
but what if he goes
on a journey and says

1936
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,823
whatever he's thinking,
which-- who knows--

1937
01:21:34,889 --> 01:21:37,492
you know, what plans
he has that I don't know about.

1938
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,927
But<i> Survivor</i> does that to you.

1939
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:41,496
Like, everyone has
those moments of like,

1940
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,299
"Is everybody just
lying to me right now?"

1941
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:45,867
PROBST:
Jon, it's interesting that

1942
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,269
playing out right now
is everything

1943
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:48,637
we talked about
at the marooning.

1944
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,104
The idea of building
a new community

1945
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:52,140
where you can feel safe in it,

1946
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,576
but then you put on top of it
the game.

1947
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:57,646
So, how confident are you
about the vote?

1948
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:59,648
I don't know
what kind of conversations

1949
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,517
would have taken place
if Andy hadn't

1950
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,220
drawn the... the evil eye.
I-I really don't know.

1951
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,755
But when you know

1952
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,291
that there's all these different
conversations going on

1953
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:12,527
and that there is
a natural target,

1954
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,396
it really starts
to make you wonder,

1955
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:16,197
who's the unnatural target?

1956
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,900
Could I be trying
to find that person?

1957
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,268

01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:09,103
-That looks...
<i>-SOL: Rome is...</i>

1991
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,305
Ah.

1992
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:11,439
<i>SOL:</i>
<i>He's a lot.</i>

1993
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:15,510
<i>SUE: The rage on her face--</i>
<i>that put the nail in the coffin.</i>

1994
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,479
<i>SAM: I was not ready</i>

1995
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:18,912
for the bomb that Andy
was about to drop.

1996
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:25,019
Nobody imagines that
they'll be the first to go.

1997
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:26,754
<i>But when you take a risk,</i>

1998
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,090
<i>sometimes it doesn't</i>
<i>go the way you want.</i>

1999
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:31,259
<i>But that's why</i>
<i>they call it a risk.</i>

2000
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,261
<i>This will bring so much joy</i>

2001
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:36,264
<i>to my friends and family</i>
<i>making fun of me for years</i>

2002
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,299
<i>that maybe in the end,</i>
<i>it'll be worth it.</i>

2003
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:39,601
<i>First out.</i>

2004
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:41,870
Let me have it, people.
Let me have it.

2005
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,671
