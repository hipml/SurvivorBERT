1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:07,374
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE VIBA TRIBE,

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,875
THE MEN FORMED A BOND.

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,611
THEYRE PART OF THE
BROCHACOS.

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,213
Jeff: AND SO DID THE WOMEN.

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,816
HEART AND HEADS.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,419
Jeff: AT THE VUKU TRIBE, AN
ALLIANCE FELL APART.

7
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,154
I TRUST MY GUT.

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,356
ALEC BLINDSIDED ME.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,291
THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,459
Jeff: AND TENSIONS WERE
HIGH.

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:30,296
WE AINT GOT BUT TWO HOURS OF
DAYLIGHT LEFT.

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,831
I DONT LIKE STUPID PEOPLE.

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,668
THE JABENI TRIBE WAS FACING
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND THE ROCK

14
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,804
STAR ALLIANCE HELD ALL THE
POWER.

15
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,673
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEST FOR
US?

16
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,410
MY GUT SAYS LYRSA ONE MINUTE
AND ANGELINA THE NEXT MINUTE.

17
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,378
WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

18
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:51,251
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
NICK AND MIKE SENT LYRSA HOME.

19
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,685
LYRSA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,020
BYE, GUYS.

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:01:04,097
Jeff: 13 ARE LEFT WHOM WILL
BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

22
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:10,737
Jeff: 13 ARE LEFT WHOM WILL
BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,273
ITS A DELIGHTFUL MORNING,
GUYS.

24
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:17,911
LIFE IS BETTER WHEN YOU DONT
HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL.

25
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:23,917
WHATS GOING ON?

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,785
SOMEBODY IS WAVING AT US.

27
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,453
WHAT?

28
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,687
OH, MY GOD.

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,191
SO WE ARE HAVING AN EXTREMELY
LAZY MORNING WHEN WE HEAR THE

30
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,993
ROARING OF A LITTLE BIT OF
MOTOR.

31
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,296
THEYRE COMING TO VIBA BEACH.

32
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,768
WE SPRINT OUT TO THE BEACH
AND I IMMEDIATELY CAN DETECT THE

33
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:42,635
VUKU TRIBE PULLING UP.

34
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:46,106
NEXT THING I KNOW THERE IS
ANOTHER BOAT.

35
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,308
AND ITS THE JABENI TRIBE.

36
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,977
IM THINKING, THIS IS THE MERGE.

37
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:56,282
THE GAME STARTS NOW.

38
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,085
TO ME I THINK THE MERGE
SIGNIFIES THAT YOU REALLY START

39
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,019
PLAYING STRICTLY FOR YOURSELF.

40
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,055
HELLO, EVERYONE.

41
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,523
OH, MY GOD.

42
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,860
SO IM GOING TO HAVE TO TRY
TO BUILD SOME DIFFERENT

43
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,062
RELATIONSHIP, BECAUSE I DONT
THINK THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO

44
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,298
TRUST JUST SIMPLY THE DAVIDS,
ESPECIALLY ELIZABETH.

45
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,635
SHE GETS UNDER MY SKIN, AND AT
THIS POINT, I WOULD BE WILLING

46
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:20,173
TO GET RID OF HER, BUT AS OF
RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT TO TASTE A

47
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,042
BEER, YOU KNOW?

48
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:27,780
OH, MY GOD.

49
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,151
CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYTHING
YOU NEED FOR A PERFECT MERGE IS

50
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,919
RIGHT HERE.

51
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,187
OH, MY DWUD.

52
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,088
LOOK AT ALL THIS.

53
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:39,359
THIS WHOLE TIME I HAVE BEEN
CONCERNED.

54
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,560
IVE BEEN LOSING MY GAME.

55
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:44,664
I LOOK AT THE TABLE AND THERE
HAS TO BE 100,000 CALORIES AT

56
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,899
LEAST.

57
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,368
I SEE EVERYTHING THAT I COULD
HOPE TO PUT IN MY FACE, AND I AM

58
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,104
ABOUT TO GO TO TOWN ON ALL THIS
DELICIOUS FOOD.

59
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:56,843
CONGRATULATION, EVERYONE.

60
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,878
ARE THOSE SWEET POTATOES?

61
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,881
OH, MY GOD.

62
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,485
SO EVERYONE IS ENJOYING THE
FEAST, BUT EVERYBODY IS ALSO

63
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,853
HERE TO PLAY THE GAME.

64
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,656
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD GOING INTO
THE MERGE WITH THE IDEA THAT

65
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,892
WERE GOING THE THEY TRUE TO OUR
OWN TRIBAL ALLIANCE, EVEN THOUGH

66
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:18,464
I REALLY GOT THE LIKE CHRISTIAN
A LOT WHEN WE WERE ON TRIBE VIBA

67
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,632
TOGETHER.

68
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,202
THE NUMBERS ARE 7-6, SO WE START
WHITTLING AWAY ALL THE OLD

69
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:27,006
DAVIDS AND THEN DO BATTLE LIKE
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES AT THE END.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,543
GABBY, WILL YOU DATE ME IN.

71
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,779
ILL DOUBLE DATE YOU.

72
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,449
I KNOW TYPICALLY WITH THE MERGE
THERE IS SOME KIND OF IDOL

73
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,717
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE.

74
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,285
SOMETIMES YOU CAN FIND A CLUE AT
FEAST.

75
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,690
I NOTICE WE ALL HAVE INDIVIDUAL
NAPKIN HOLDERS, AND I WAS SUPER

76
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,559
CONSCIOUS OF WHAT IF THERE IS
SOMETHING IN IT, AND I ALSO

77
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,162
NOTICED THE SIGN THAT CAME WITH
THE TABLE THAT SAID, EVERYTHING

78
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,864
YOU NEED FOR THE MERGE IS RIGHT
HERE.

79
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,367
WELL, DOES THAT ALSO MEAN SOME
KIND OF ADVANTAGE?

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,635
I DONT KNOW.

81
00:03:55,668 --> 00:04:00,240
BUT I DIDNT SEE ANYTHING HIDDEN
AT THE TABLE.

82
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,743
THIS COULD BE "SURVIVOR"
PARANOIA WHERE YOU LOOK FOR A

83
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:13,886
SIGN IN EVERYTHING WHERE THERES
NOT ONE.

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,256
THATS WHAT THEY TOLD ME
ABOUT NATALIA.

85
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,758
OF COURSE, I NEVER MET HER.

86
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,294
IVE SEEN HER IN TRIBAL.

87
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,862
I LOOK AT ALEC.

88
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:30,670
ALEC LOOKS AT DAVID, AND HE
GOES... LIKE THAT.

89
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:35,842
IT COMES TO LIGHT THAT ALEC
ORCHESTRATED A BLINDSIDE AGAINST

90
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,245
NATALIA, AND MY FIRST REACTION
IS SHOCK.

91
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,049
IM LIKE, DUDE, YOURE ON A
TRIBE WITH THE MAJORITY, AND IT

92
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,352
SEEMS LIKE A CARELESS AND
EMOTIONAL MOVE.

93
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,020
YOU.

94
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:47,987
WHAT HAPPENED?

95
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,656
ALEC DID THAT.

96
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,224
WAS SHE GOING NUTS?

97
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,293
I DONT KNOW, BECAUSE I NEVER
MET HER.

98
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,227
I WAS AT EXILE.

99
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,161
WOW.

100
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,263
THIS MEANS I MEAD TO TREAD
LIGHTLY WITH ALEC.

101
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:03,036
HES ALREADY SHOWN HOW QUICKLY
HELL FLIP.

102
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,039
AND SO ITS A DANGEROUS
SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE ARE SIX

103
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,275
DAVIDS AND THERE ARE SEVEN
GOLIATHS, IF ONE PERSON WANTS TO

104
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:15,581
FLIP, THEY CAN COMPLETELY CHANGE
THE GAME.

105
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,349
ALL RIGHT, YALL.

106
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,617
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

107
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,351
TRIBE NAME.

108
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,520
OKAY, OKAY.

109
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,690
SO I STARTED DOODLING WORDS.

110
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:28,561
AND I LIKE KALO KALO, WHICH
MEANT STARS.

111
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:37,303
IM DOWN FOR THE GOOD VIBES.

112
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,038
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

113
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:51,017
IF YOU SAY SOMETHING... SHES SO
ANNOYING.

114
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,420
CARL IS DRUNK, AND HES
TELLING ME THAT HES ANNOYED

115
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,022
WITH ELIZABETH.

116
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,425
SHE DOESNT NECESSARILY FIT IN,
AND IM ALL ON BOARD.

117
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,527
I THINK SHES NUMBER-ONE OUT.

118
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,796
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE IS TO
TAKE OUT A DAVID.

119
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,465
SHE HAS TO GO.

120
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,767
I CANT TAKE HER MUCH LONGER.

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,003
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS, SO WE
NEED TO TAKE THE DAVID TRIBE OUT

122
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:18,378
WHILE WE STILL CAN AND KEEP US
GOLIATH STRONG.

123
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,580
ALL RIGHT.

124
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,149
SO FIRST OFF, MASON.

125
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,519
IVE BEEN WAITING.

126
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,588
I WANT THE TALK AND THEN GET
BACK.

127
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,791
IM SO DPLD YOU SURVIVED ALL
THOSE VOTES.

128
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,025
CONGRATULATIONS.

129
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:39,499
I AM SO GLAD THAT MY PAL, THE
MASON TO MY DIXON, KENTUCKY NICK

130
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,833
IS STILL IN THE GAME.

131
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,235
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

132
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,704
YOU PROMISE YOU WONT TELL
NOBODY?

133
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,671
I THINK DAN HAS ONE.

134
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,442
HE GAVE ME ACTUAL ACTIONABLE
INTELLIGENCE.

135
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:54,781
HE THINKS THAT DAN HAS AN IDOL.

136
00:06:54,814 --> 00:07:00,219
THAT IS A PIECE OF WOOD.

137
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,422
THATS A HUGE PIECE OF
INFORMATION.

138
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,656
YEAH, WERE NUMBER ONE.

139
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,491
OKAY.

140
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,793
YEAH, DUDE.

141
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,627
HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE.

142
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:17,236
THATS AWESOME.

143
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,571
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

144
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,474
I WAS LIKE, I NEED MY COMFORT
BLANKET.

145
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:25,378
I NEED MY PERSON WHO MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER.

146
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,779
REUNITING WITH KARA WAS AWESOME.

147
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,147
IT WAS SO NICE TO SEE HER.

148
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,616
WE JUMP RIGHT BACK IN THE SWING
OF THINGS.

149
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,251
I FOUND ANOTHER IDOL.

150
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,853
NO, YOU DIDNT?

151
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,788
YOURE THE ONLY PERSON IVE
TOLD.

152
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,656
REALLY?

153
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,058
I TOLD HER THAT I FOUND A
SECOND IDOL.

154
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,829
I PLANNED ON KEEPING THAT ONE
ALL TO MYSELF, BUT I WAS JUST SO

155
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,864
EXCITED TO SEE HER, I CANT HELP
IT.

156
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,200
AND IM THE ONLY ONE WHO
KNOWS?

157
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,470
DAN SHARES WITH ME ON THE
BEACH THAT HE NOW HAS FOUND

158
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,338
ANOTHER IMMUNITY IDOL, SO IM
FEELING GOOD.

159
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,740
WEVE GOT TWO FREAKING IDOLS.

160
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,877
THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE, WEVE GOT
THE GOLDEN TICKET.

161
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,111
JUST KEEP IT GOING.

162
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,614
JUST DONT MESS THIS UP.

163
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,817
LETS GET EVERYONE ELSE OUT
EXCEPT FOR US.

164
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,321
WE REALLY HAVE EACH OTHERS
BACKS IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, IF

165
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,021
ANYTHING POPS UP.

166
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,656
WERE THE MOST UNIFIED GROUP.

167
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,492
I THINK WE KEEP GETTING
DAVIDS OUT.

168
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,126
SO WHO IS FIRST?

169
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,964
ELIZABETH.

170
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,965
IM WITH YOU 100%.

171
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,166
LETS GET HER OUT OF HERE.

172
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,235
GOLIATH HAS A MAJORITY RIGHT.

173
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:27,507
NOWLY RIDE THAT WAVE AS LONG AS
THAT WAVE IS STABLE.

174
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,275
I LIKE CHRISTIAN.

175
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,644
YOU CANT LET HIM LURE YOU
IN.

176
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,879
HE HAS TO GO EARLY.

177
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,882
I THINK WE HAVE TO BLINDSIDE
HIM WHEN WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

178
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,452
I WOULD LOVE TO USE THE
NUMBERS TO TAKE OUT THE BIGGEST

179
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:39,952
DAVID THREAT.

180
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,120
WE HAVE OUR FIVE.

181
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,690
THIS IS LIKE REWARD, IMMUNITY,
REWARD, IMMUNITY.

182
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,092
THE OLD GOLIATH TRIBE.

183
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,395
IM WITH YOU GUYS FOR SURE, BUT
YOURE NOW EVE TO THINK GOING

184
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,566
ENTER A MERGE THAT THINGS ARE
GOING TO STAY DAVID AND GOLIATH,

185
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,969
SO ITS LIKE KEEP DOING YOUR
THING AND THINK YOURE GOLIATH

186
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,372
STRONG AND ILL JUMP ON BOARD
WITH THE DAVIDS.

187
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,306
ILL FORM THOSE CONNECTIONS.

188
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,842
BRO, I WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU.

189
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,110
IM CLOSE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE.

190
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,680
THE THING IS I DONT KNOW WHO
IS GOING TO GO HOME, BUT WHAT I

191
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,783
DO KNOW IF WE CAN TRUST EACH
OTHER NOW, AND IF WE CAN LIKE

192
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,820
FORM THIS UNLIKELY RELATIONSHIP,
LIKE YOU AND ME, RIGHT, AND

193
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,658
WHOEVER ELSE, LIKE DUDE, IF I
HAVE YOUR BACK, LIKE PEOPLE

194
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,393
ARENT GOING TO SUSPECT IT.

195
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,729
SO WHAT YOURE SAYING IS THIS
SHOULD BE A LINE OF

196
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,198
COMMUNICATION THAT WE SHOULD
NURTURE BUT ON THE DOWN LOW.

197
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,000
100%, 100%.

198
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,368
IM TOTALLY ON BOARD WITH
THAT.

199
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,169
ITS THE MERGE.

200
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,805
I THINK WE WILL SEE ALLIANCES
BREAK.

201
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:33,773
THERE WILL BE TEARS SHED.

202
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,841
THERE WILL BE BLINDSIDES.

203
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,410
THERE WILL BE IDOLS FLUSHED.

204
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,112
ITS MY TIME TO SHINE RIGHT NOW.

205
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:11,010
I HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS
ABOUT DAN AND KARA, BECAUSE I

206
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,879
WAS SLEEPING TWO PEOPLE AWAY,
AND HER AND DAN WERE WHISPERING

207
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:18,050
FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS.

208
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,721
THAT SEEMS LIKE A POTENTIAL
TWOSOME.

209
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,191
WHETHER OR NOT THERES ANYTHING
ROMANTIC OR NOT, THATS PRETTY

210
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,727
MUCH IRRELEVANT, THEYRE TWO
CLOSE PEOPLE.

211
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:35,768
THATS A THREAT TO ME.

212
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,076
I WANT SOME COFFEE.

213
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,379
I NEED A SOY LATTE STAT.

214
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,315
GETTING TO THE MERGE, MY
STRATEGY FROM THE BEGINNING IS

215
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,585
TO FIGURE OUT WHO I CAN WORK
WITH AMONGST THE DAVIDS AND WHO

216
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,621
PUNKS THE GOLIATHS I STILL FEEL
LIKE I CONNECT WITH.

217
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,995
ALISON, I STILL THINK SHES
COOL.

218
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:03,896
I LIKE ALEC.

219
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:09,135
THE THREE OF US COULD WORK WELL
TOGETHER.

220
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,204
I CAME OVER FROM JABENI WITH
NICK.

221
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,941
MY HOPE WAS TO BE ABLE TO WORK
WITH ALEC AND ALISON AND BRING

222
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,176
NICK INTO THE FOLD.

223
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,979
WE KNOW THAT LIKE THE GOLIATHS
ARE GOING TO FALL APART AT SOME

224
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,315
POINT, AND I WANT TO HAVE A
SOLID SIX SO WE CAN MAKE SURE TO

225
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,483
MONOPOLIZE THE GAME.

226
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,887
WE GET DOWN TO 11, WE NEED
LIKE SIX.

227
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,389
US THREE, BUT WE NEED
NUMBERS.

228
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,491
THAT WAY --
 WHO DO YOU THINK?

229
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:37,730
I DIG NICK AND CHRISTIAN AND
GABBY.

230
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,266
YOUVE COME TO PLAY
"SURVIVOR," AND THE GAME IN MY

231
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,636
OPINION DOESNT REALLY START
UNTIL THE MERGE HAPPENS.

232
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,871
PREMERGE YOURE AT LIKE THE
PREGAME, THE PREPARTY.

233
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,107
EVERYONE THE STILL GETTING
READY, DOING THEIR HAIR.

234
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,343
THEN YOU COME HERE, AND ITS 13
OF US, AND THIS IS LIKE THE

235
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,144
PARTY.

236
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,680
THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE
R.S.V.P.s FOR.

237
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,250
NOW YOU CAN PICK UP THE GIRLS,
THIS IS IT.

238
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,952
SO IM TIGHT WITH ALISON.

239
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:00,453
YEAH.

240
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,487
I DIG CHRISTIAN.

241
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,390
IM SO GLAD YOU LIKE
CHRISTIAN.

242
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,725
CHRISTIAN HAS BEEN MY PERSON
THROUGHOUT THIS.

243
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,894
I WAS TELLING CHRISTIAN, I
THINK DAVID AND GOLIATH IS SO

244
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,462
OVER.

245
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,296
I WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU.

246
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,565
I WANT TO PLAY WITH NICK,
ALISON.

247
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,666
I DIG MIKE.

248
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,534
YES, I LIKE MIKE A LOT, TOO.

249
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,638
THIS GAME ISNT ABOUT, YOU
KNOW, JUST NUMBERS, YOU HAVE TO

250
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,706
EARN THIS TITLE.

251
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,275
YOU HAVE TO FORM CONNECTIONS AND
BUILD RELATIONSHIPS.

252
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,644
THATS HOW YOURE GOING TO GET
FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THE GAME.

253
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,180
RIGHT NOW I NEED TO FOCUS ON WHO
DO I NEED TO TALK TO.

254
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,083
WE WANT TO WORK ACROSS
TRIBAL, WHICH MAKES SENSE

255
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,251
OBVIOUSLY.

256
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,154
I HAVE.

257
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,123
I DIG CHRISTIAN.

258
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,791
ALISON AND CHRISTIAN?

259
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,959
YEAH.

260
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,763
IT FEELS LIKE IT MIGHT MAKE
SENSE TO TAKE TWO DAVIDS OUT

261
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,630
EARLY ON.

262
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,200
I WAS GOING TO SAY,
ELIZABETH, RIGHT?

263
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,871
KEEP THOSE LIVES THAT ARE
LEFT TOTALLY IN THE DARK.

264
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,240
YEAH, YEAH.

265
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,375
I JUST WATCHED OUT ON THE
BEACH AND GOT INVITED INTO AN

266
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:00,513
ALLIANCE OF SIX, THATS GOOD
NEWS FOR ME.

267
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:04,517
THIS GETS ME FURTHER IN THE GAME
AND SO WITH MORE ALLIES, WHEN

268
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,788
THE GOLIATHS ARE READY TO TURN
ON EACH OTHER, IM GOING TO GET

269
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,889
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

270
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,592
I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS
EXCITED ABOUT THIS GROUP IM

271
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,161
WITH.

272
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:19,031
AT A TOP SUPERFICIAL VIEW,
THERE ARE SEVEN GOLIATH, SIX

273
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:23,736
DAVID, WHICH WOULD ORDINARILY
LOOK QUITE BAD FOR THE DAVIDS,

274
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,572
BUT RIGHT NOW THERE IS A
COUNTER-GOLIATH INSURGENCY

275
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:32,311
THATS FORMING, SIX PEOPLE,
THREE FORMER DAVID, THREE FORMER

276
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,647
GOLIATH, MYSELF, GABBY AND NICK
ON ONE SIDE.

277
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,850
AND ALISON, MIKE AND ALEC ON THE
OTHER SIDE.

278
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:43,355
ID CALL IT A STRIKE FORCE,
BECAUSE ALEC, HE IS READY TO

279
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,523
MOVE.

280
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,526
HES... A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK
ABOUT DAVID AND GOLIATH BEING

281
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,829
OVER, BUT ALEC WALKS THE WALK.

282
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,032
HE APPARENTLY FLIPPED THE
SCRIPTED AT THAT INFAMOUS VUKU

283
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,402
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHEN NATALIA WENT
HOME, SO ALEC IS SPEARHEADING

284
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:01,473
THIS STRIKE FORCE OF SIX, WHICH
AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED WILL BE

285
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,976
PARACHUTED IN TO SOME
BATTLEFIELD SOMEWHERE TO DEPLOY

286
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:16,589
A VOTE AND TAKE OUT A TARGET
WHEN WE SEE FIT.

287
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,724
THEY WERE TALKING FOR TWO
HOURS.

288
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:24,129
THEYRE A THREAT.

289
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,401
IF WE COULD KEEP THE DAVIDS
TOGETHER, THAT WOULD DEFINITELY

290
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,939
BE MY FIRST CHOICE, BUT WE ARE
OUTNUMBERED RIGHT NOW.

291
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:38,043
SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PULL
ONE TO MAKE THAT INITIAL VOTE

292
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:43,682
OFF.

293
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,485
ALEC VOTED OUT A GOLIATH WHEN WE
WERE AT THE VUKU BEACH.

294
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:50,589
SO I KNOW FOR SURE THAT HES HAD
MY BACK ONCE, MAYBE HELL HAVE

295
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,525
IT AGAIN.

296
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,729
IF WE CAN GET ALL THE DAVIDS TO
VOTE DAN, WOULD YOU VOTE DAN,

297
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,329
TOO?

298
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,430
LIKE FOR THE FIRST ONE?

299
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,634
YEAH.

300
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,069
THATS A GOOD IDEA.

301
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:10,175
HES A STRATEGIC PLAYER AND HES
GOT KARA IN HIS BACK POCKET.

302
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,344
ALEC WOULD BE THE ODD BALL
OUT.

303
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,980
I WOULD BE WITH A BUNCH OF
DAVIDS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

304
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:15,481
RIGHT.

305
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,115
I UNDERSTAND.

306
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,283
ITS HARD.

307
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,285
LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.

308
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,154
THINK ABOUT IT AND LET ME
KNOW.

309
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:26,158
ELIZABETH WANTS TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE, AND WITH MY NEW ALLIANCE,

310
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,994
THE IDEA IN THE FUTURE IS, YEAH,
WERE GOING TO TURN ON THE

311
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,298
GOLIATHS AND START PICKING THEM
OFF, BUT I NEED TO PLAY DOUBLE

312
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:32,798
AGENT AS LONG AS I CAN.

313
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,733
THERE YOU ARE.

314
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,935
JUST THE MAN I WAS LOOKING FOR.

315
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,471
I DONT WANT THE RUIN THAT
RIGHT NOW AND HAVE TO SHOW MY

316
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,172
CARDS THIS EARLY.

317
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,074
ELIZABETH GAVE ME HER PITCH.

318
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,777
SHE SAID, OH, YEAH, SHE WAS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU TWO.

319
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,378
SHES LIKE, DOES IT CONCERN YOU?

320
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,113
I WAS LIKE, DOES IT CONCERN YOU?

321
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,148
SHES LIKE, YEAH.

322
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,785
THEN SHE GOES, YEAH, I WANT TO
VOTE OUT DAN.

323
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,254
I DONT KNOW WHY MY NAME KEEPS
COMING UP.

324
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,221
I TOLD YOU.

325
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,525
WHY ME AND NOT JOHN?

326
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,995
I AM FURIOUS WHEN I HEAR THAT
ELIZABETH IS THROWING MY NAME

327
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,930
OUT THERE.

328
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,001
I DONT REALLY UNDERSTAND IT,
BECAUSE I AINT DONE ANYTHING

329
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,603
ASTRONOMICAL, SO WHY MY NAME IS
BEING THROWN OUT IS BEYOND ME.

330
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,604
DONT FREAK OUT.

331
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,406
YEAH, YOURE FINE.

332
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,941
IF I GO HOME, I GO HOME.

333
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,210
DAN SITTING PRETTY.

334
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,746
TWO IMMUNITY IDOL, THE MAJORITY
ALLIANCE TELLING HIM WHATS

335
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,613
GOING ON.

336
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,082
HE SHOULD FEEL LIKE KING OF THE
CASTLE.

337
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,485
SO INTERNALLY IM THINKING LIKE,
GET YOURSELF TOGETHER, SLAP

338
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,353
YOURSELF INTO SCHAAP.

339
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,822
IT COULD BE SO MUCH WORSE.

340
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,090
ITS JUST WHATEVER.

341
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,559
SCREW IT.

342
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,563
YOU WANT TO PUT MY NAME OUT,
THERE ILL SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN

343
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:37,997

SHES GOT TO GO.

345

00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,678
ALL RIGHT, GIRL.

453
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,781
I NEEDED A NEW PIECE OF
JEWELRY.

454
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,784
Jeff: WHAT ARE YOU FEELING
RIGHT NOW IN BECAUSE I CAN FEEL

455
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,652
YOUR ENTIRE BODY IS JUST
PULSING.

456
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,622
IM LITERALLY IN ECSTASY.

457
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:47,058
ALL IM THINKING ABOUT IS WHEN

00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,113
CONGRATS.

467
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,381
THATS RIGHT.

468
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,916
Jeff: ELIZABETH NOT WINNING
WAS A BIG FACTOR.

469
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,250
ELIZABETH WAS THROWING OUT MY
NAME.

470
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,418
THAT MOUNTAIN HAWKS ME WANT --
THAT MAKES ME WANT TO GET HER

471
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,553
OUT OF HERE.

472
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:18,857
ON TOP OF US, IT WOULD BE STUPID
NOT TO GET A DAVID OUT.

473
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,659
ITS NOT HARD, NOT HARD AT ALL.

474
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,684
TO ME ELIZABETH IS NOT
NECESSARILY A THREAT.

475
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,618
LIKE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.

476
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,619
SHES A MEDIUM THREAT.

477
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,920
SHE WAS ONE TODAY.

478
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,755
SHES A MEDIUM THREAT.

479
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,556
LET ME FINISH.

480
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,657
LET ME FINISH.

481
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:53,825
SO SHES A MEDIUM THREAT.

482
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,627
SHE DOESNT HAVE ANY ALLIES.

483
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,730
SHE DOESNT HAVE ANY SOCIAL
GRACES, SO WHY NOT USE THIS

484
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,066
OPPORTUNITY TO BLIND SIDE THE
DAVIDS WHEN THEY THINK ITS

485
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,034
GOING TO BE ELIZABETH.

486
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,370
CHRISTIAN THE OTHER NIGHT, HES
THE BIGGEST THREAT ON THE

487
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,505
DAVIDS.

488
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,540
HES THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT
US PROBABLY ON THAT SIDE.

489
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,508
IT BREAKS MY HEART.

490
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,843
I LOVE THE GUY, BUT HE COULD
BEAT US ALL.

491
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,946
I DONT WANT TO SIT AROUND AND
WAIT FOR THE GAME TO COME TO ME.

492
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,382
I WANT TO TAKE OUT THE BIGGEST
THREAT RIGHT NOW.

493
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,251
AND THAT IS CHRISTIAN.

494
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,319
HES A GOLIATH IN HIS OWN RIGHT.

495
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,890
AND IM HOPING TO SWAY HIM AT
TONIGHTS TRIBAL.

496
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,894
IN MILITARY WARFARE, YOU
NEVER WANT YOUR ENEMY TO KNOW

497
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,028
WHEN YOURE GOING TO HIT.

498
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,162
ITS ALWAYS A BAD CALL.

499
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,664
THEY KNOW ITS ELIZABETH.

500
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,268
GIVEN THAT MY HUSBAND SERVED IN
THE MARINE CORPS, THE WAY THAT

501
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,304
IM ANGLING THE CONVERSATION TO
THE GOLIATH TRIBE IS REALLY

502
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,906
BASED OFF OF MILITARY TACK TUX.

503
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:45,377
IT KIND OF GETS THEM FIRED UP,
LUKE WERE GOING INTO BATTLE.

504
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,647
SO ITS INTENTIONAL LANGUAGE IM
USING TO GET MY TRIBE IN THE

505
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,081
GAME.

506
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:57,556
SO TONIGHT IM RALLY
DEPENDING ON OTHER GOLIATHS TO

507
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,892
EXECUTE MY VISION, OUR VISION,
AND TAKE OUT

508
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,892
<i>THE</i>

509
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,892
BIGGEST DAVID

510
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,496
IN THIS GAME.

511
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,166
IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS GAME
IT MAKES SENSE.

512
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,603
ANGELINA HAS THIS BRIGHT IDEA
THAT ELIZABETH ISNT THE BIGGEST

513
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:15,040
THREAT, THEREFORE SHE DOESNT
NEED TO GO, WELL, ME, IM TORN,

514
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,710
BECAUSE CHRISTIAN IS A
BROCHOCHO.

515
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,913
I LOVE THAT KID TO DEATH.

516
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,783
THE REAL THING THAT BUGS ME IS
SHES TALKING ALL THESE MILITARY

517
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,550
TERMS.

518
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,285
SORRY, YOURE NOT IN THE
MILITARY.

519
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,955
THAT MEANS YOU DONT KNOW JACK
SQUAT.

520
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,657
ITS EASY WHEN YOUR NAME IS NOT
BEING THROWN OUT, THERE BUT IF

521
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,994
WERE IN AN ALLIANCE AND WERE
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF EACH

522
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,228
OTHER.

523
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,798
CHRISTIAN AINT GOING TO WIN THE
NEXT NINE IMMOONITIES, WE CAN

524
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,498
TAKE HIM OUT.

525
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,367
HOW HARD IS THAT TO UNDERSTAND?

526
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,870
ITS BASIC.

527
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:53,578
THE STORY WERE SELLING THEM
IS THAT WERE SO PA -- THETIC

528
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,882
THAT WED RATHER TURN ON
OURSELVES, ANYONE BUT ME.

529
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,317
ACT LUCK WE DONT HAVE POWER.

530
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,854
ORIGINALLY I WAS FINE WITH
VOTING OFF ELIZABETH AS SORT OF

531
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:07,058
A SACRIFICIAL LAMB KNOWING THAT
AFTER THIS VOTE I HAVE PEOPLE

532
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,694
THAT WANT TO WORK WITH ME.

533
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,963
WHAT ARE THEY DOING DOWN
THERE?

534
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,164
TALKING.

535
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,533
BUT TO BE A DAVID AND FEEL
LIKE AN UNDERDOG AND TO SEE IT

536
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,004
PLAY OUT IN REAL TIME WHERE THE
GOLIATHS WALK UP AND DOWN THE

537
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,140
BEACH AND FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE
THEIR PICK OF THE LITTER OF WHO

538
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:29,314
THEY WANT TO TAKE OUT, ITS JUST
SO -- I WOULDNT EXPECT ANYTHING

539
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,548
LESS OF THE GOLIATHS.

540
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,986
ITS HARD TO FEEL LIKE YOUR
FATE IS IN SOMEBODY ELSES HAND.

541
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,523
ITS SO INFURIATING TO FEEL
LIKE AN UNDERDOG THIS WHOLE GAME

542
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,726
AND HAVE TO SIT THERE IN THE
SHELTER AND HOPE THAT ITS NOT

543
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,662
YOU.

544
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:49,267
THEY JUST GET SO SET IN THEIR
WAYS.

545
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,302
SHES NOT EVEN CONVINCING
EITHER.

546
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,071
THE THING IS KNOW ABOUT YOU
STRIKE FORCE.

547
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:57,442
YOU HAVE NO WHAT IDEA RIGHT NOW.

548
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,445
ANGELINA, THE MASTER
MANIPULATOR, SHE WANTS TO GET

549
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,613
OUT CHRISTIAN.

550
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,916
BUT I HAVE BUILT THIS LITTLE
SMALL ARMY OF THREE DAVIDS AND

551
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:09,487
THREE GOLIATHS, AND IF I WERE TO
VOTE OUT CHRISTIAN, I LOSE TRUST

552
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,292
NOW WITH NOT ONLY GABBY, NICK,
AND CHRISTIAN, BUT I LOSE TRUST

553
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,062
WITH ALL THE DAVIDS, BECAUSE IN
THEIR EYES IM JUST STICKING

554
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:24,235
WITH THE GOLIATHS AND THEN ITS
US AGAINST THEM.

555
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:28,640
WE CANT FLIP ON GABBY AND
CHRISTIAN.

556
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:29,641
WE STILL SOLID?

557
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,709
YES.

558
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,112
RIGHT NOW VOTING OUT
CHRISTIAN IS NOT BEST FOR MY

559
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:34,679
GAME.

560
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,415
HEAR ME OUT, IM SOLID.

561
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:42,253
JUST... IT MAKES ME NERVOUS THE
UNPREDICTABILITY, THEN

562
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:42,954
PREDICTABLE NATURE OF ELIZABETH.

563
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,224
WE SHOULD HAVE GOT ELIZABETH.

564
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,726
THEN WE DECIDED CHRISTIAN.

565
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,096
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD GET
ELIZABETH.

566
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,697
WE ALL FOUR WANT ELIZABETH.

567
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,200
I WANT ELIZABETH.

568
00:28:55,233 --> 00:29:00,004
WE NEED TO CONVINCE WHO?

569
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:00,638
ANGELINA.

570
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,274
WHAT IF ANGELINA SAYS NO?

571
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:09,013
THEN ITS GOING TO BE --
 I THINK WE NEED TO TALK TO

572
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:09,614
ANGELINA.

573
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:22,794
ILL TALK TO ANGELINA.

574
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:45,784
RIGHT NOW ITS BETTER TO GET
RID OF THE CHAOS.

575
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:49,220
I DISAGREE, BUT ILL GO WITH
THE GROUP.

576
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:56,661
ILL DO IT, BUT I DISAGREE.

577
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:03,268
ITS LIKE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATE
TOOK OBAMA RUSHED BY COMPLETELY

578
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,704
DIFFERENT PLAN TO, HAVE DAN BE
SUPER CONTINUE SENDING.

579
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,807
I DONT APPRECIATE THAT.

580
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,809
SHES OVER THERE WHISPERING.

581
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:16,481
ITS NOT HER DECISION.

582
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,550
HE MAKES ME SUPER NERVOUS NOW.

583
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,187
NOW I DONT EVEN FEEL SAFE IN MY
OWN HOME, IN MY OWN LAND.

584
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,356
AND ITS SECOND DAY, THIRD DAY
OF THE MERGE.

585
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,827
AND HE SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED
THAT THIS IS PART OF THE

586
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,129
INHERENT RISK IN FLIP-FLOPPING
AGAIN WHEN YOUR GROUP ALREADY

587
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:31,896
MADE A DECISION.

588
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,997
RIGHT.

589
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,000
AND I WASNT EVEN THERE TO BE
PART OF THAT DECISION.

590
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,437
LIKE AT LEAST THE FIRST TIME WE
WERE ALL THERE AND SAID 100%.

591
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,705
I WAS TOLD WHAT THE DO.

592
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:50,782
THATS WHAT WERE TRYING TO
AVOID.

593
00:30:50,782 --> 00:31:01,759
THATS WHAT WERE TRYING TO
AVOID.

594
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,163
HEY.

595
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,865
WE SHOULD NOT BE TALKING.

596
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,033
ILL PROBABLY GET IN TROUBLE.

597
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,768
THEYRE THROWING YOUR NAME OUT
THERE.

598
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:15,673
BUT IM THE ONLY PERSON, I WANT
TO BE UP FRONT WITH YOU, BECAUSE

599
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,576
IVE GOT NOTHING BUT AMAZINGNESS
FROM YOU, AND I HAVE TRIED.

600
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,047
I THOUGHT I HAD A DIFFERENT
PLAN.

601
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:27,752
THEN THEY FLIPPED AGAIN.

602
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,721
I APPRECIATE THAT.

603
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,892
YOU HAVE A BIG HEART, AND I
JUST RESPECT YOU AS A PERSON.

604
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:34,993
I JUST DIDNT WANT THIS.

605
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,494
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

606
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,229
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS
TO ME.

607
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:41,432
I JUST FIGURED THE MORE
INFORMATION.

608
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,735
I WOULD RATHER SEE YOU HERE
TOMORROW THAN SOME OF THESE

609
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,302
PEOPLE.

610
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:44,969
ALL RIGHT.

611
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,573
IM GOING TO GO BACK.

612
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,608
NO, ITS OKAY.

613
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:59,284
IM GOOD.

614
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:08,226
ANGELINA CAME TO ME, SORRY IF I
START CRYING, BUT I CAME HERE TO

615
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,194
WIN "SURVIVOR."

616
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,430
I DIDNT COME HERE TO GET VOTED
OUT.

617
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,399
AND IM WILLING TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES, AND THAT INCLUDES

618
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:19,270
BETRAYING SOMEBODY.

619
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,972
THATS WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?

620
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:21,839
YEAH.

621
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,708
SHES IN THE LYING TO ME.

622
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:24,575
IS IT TRUE?

623
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,179
YES.

624
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,048
I AINT GOING TO GET MY
FEELINGS HURT BECAUSE ITS A

625
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,083
GAME.

626
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,586
TELL THE GOLIATHS THAT
ANGELINA IS TELLING THEIR PLAN

627
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,857
AND WE GET ANGELINA OUT.

628
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,192
YOU THINK THAT HIGH WORK?

629
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,895
I NEW THERE WOULD BE A
DAYLIGHT RIGHT NOW.

630
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,965
SO LETS DO IT TONIGHT,
RIGHT?

631
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:50,134
AND IM NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN,
BECAUSE I AM HERE TO WIN.

632
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,203
I AM HERE TO WIN "SURVIVOR."

633
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:57,342
I DID NOT COME HERE TO LEAVE
TONIGHT.

634
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:57,742
RIGHT?

635
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:58,776
RIGHT?

636
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,181
SO ITS GOING TO BE AN
INTERESTING TRIBAL COUNCIL.

637
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:45,323
Jeff: WOW.

638
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,624
HERE WE ARE.

639
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:52,130
ALISON, THE MERGE VOTE OFTEN
SETS THE TONE FOR THE BACK HALF

640
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,264
OF THE SEASON.

641
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,033
DO YOU SENSE THAT MIGHT BE THE
CASE WITH TONIGHTS VOTE?

642
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:58,036
I THANK GOD I HAVE THIS
AROUND MY NECK, BECAUSE BEFORE I

643
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,205
WAS ONLY HAVING TO MANAGE FOUR
OF MY OWN RELATIONSHIPS.

644
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:05,309
NOW IM MANAGING 12
RELATIONSHIPS AND IM HAVING THE

645
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:14,118
TAKE THE EXPOANT OF THAT AND IM
MANAGING A TON OF RELATIONSHIPS.

646
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:18,723
HOW MANY COMBINATIONS OF
RELATIONSHIPS DO YOU HAVE TO

647
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,758
WORRY ABOUT?

648
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,961
144 IS THE NUMBER.

649
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,464
Jeff: THERE ARE SO MANY
POSSIBLE CONFIGURATIONS OF

650
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,532
PEOPLE.

651
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,267
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO
NAVIGATE ALL THE TIME?

652
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,168
YEAH.

653
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,070
THERES SO MANY CONVERSATIONS
GOING ON.

654
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,138
YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP
EVERYTHING IN LINE AND WERE

655
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,175
GOING TO SEE WHETHER AND NOT
ITS STILL DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH.

656
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:42,613
BUT EVERYTHING IS SHIFTED AND,
YEAH.

657
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,248
Jeff: INTERESTING PAUSE.

658
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:49,954
ANGELINA, DO YOU BELIEVE ITS
STILL DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH?

659
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,255
SORRY.

660
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,157
THAT WAS WAY TOO LONG OF A
PAUSE.

661
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,661
I THINK GOLIATHS WANT TO TAKE A
MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH

662
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:57,261
TODAY.

663
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,863
THEY WANT TO STAY UNITED.

664
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,999
ITS ONE THAT IM STANDING
BEHIND TODAY.

665
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,268
I DISAGREE.

666
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,772
THE GOLIATHS ARE CONVINCING
THEMSELVES OF THIS MIRAGE THAT

667
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,274
EVERYTHING IS FINE, WHEN ITS
NOT THE REALITY.

668
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,210
THE REALITY IS THAT THERES
FRACTURES.

669
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:17,281
I KNOW THAT THE GOLIATHS ARE
GOING TO BE VOTING FOR ME

670
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,449
TONIGHT.

671
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,985
ANGELINA TOLD ME TODAY ON THE
WATERFALL TRAIL THAT SHE WAS

672
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,054
GOING TO BE VOTING FOR ME.

673
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,723
I THINK GOLIATHS KNOW THAT THERE
IS A FRACTURE IN YOUR GROUP.

674
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:31,796
JUST TO JUMP IN HERE SINCE
THIS IS KIND OF -- LIKE THIS IS

675
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,397
JUST BAD STRATEGY.

676
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:38,703
WE HAD A CONVERSATION, AND I
JUST SAID SOME THINGS THAT WE

677
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,771
TALKED ABOUT --
 YOU PROBABLY SHOULD ELABORATE

678
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,442
ON THAT IF YOU DONT WANT YOUR
TRIBE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT "THESE

679
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,710
THINGS" ARE.

680
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,346
I WAS NON-COMMITTAL BECAUSE SHE
WAS HEARING LIES AND I COULDNT

681
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:48,946
LIE AT THAT POINT.

682
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,114
IT WAS A ROUGH AFTERNOON.

683
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,817
I THINK SHE WAS ALREADY
STARTING TO MANAGE THE JURY FOR

684
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,185
HER FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

685
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:54,919
I AGREE.

686
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,220
THATS WHAT IT IS.

687
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,522
THATS WHAT SHE CAME TO ME.

688
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,624
SHE WANTED MY VOTE.

689
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,591
NOBODY ELSE TOLD ELIZABETH.

690
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,828
BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU TO
FLIP.

691
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,063
IM ASK YOU FOR AN ANSWER.

692
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:10,401
ALL I SAID WAS ITS STILL UP
IN THE AIR, AND SHE LOOKED AT ME

693
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,736
AND I SAID, I CANT ANSWER THAT.

694
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:16,407
ELIZABETH CAME TO US, THE
DAVIDS, AND SAID, "I JUST HEARD

695
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,775
IT WAS MY NAME."

696
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:21,012
SHE WAS TRYING TO GET MY JURY
VOTE AND I FELL LIKE YALL

697
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:21,579
DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT.

698
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,314
WERE AT 13 PEOPLE.

699
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,016
IM NOT THINKING THAT FAR AHEAD.

700
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,717
IM FOCUSING RIGHT NOW.

701
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:27,385
IM WITH GOLIATH.

702
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,387
I WAS NOT BACKSTABBING ANYONE.

703
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,891
THEYRE TRYING TO FRACTURE US.

704
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:34,892
GUYS...

705
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,628
ALISON, WALK ME THROUGH THE
MANAGING THE JURY.

706
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,297
THE JURY DOES BEGIN TONIGHT.

707
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,867
THE POWER IS GOING TO SHIFT,
AND THE PERSON THAT WE WRITE

708
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,671
DOWN TONIGHT IS GOING TO
DETERMINE IF WERE WORTHY OF $1

709
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,872
MILLION.

710
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,774
SO YOU CAN HAVE A HUMAN MOMENT
WITH SOMEONE AND SAY, I DIDNT

711
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:54,579
WANT IT TO BE THIS WAY, BUT ITS
GOING TO BE YOU, AND THEN YOUVE

712
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,513
POCKETED A VOTE.

713
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,182
BUT GABBY, THATS HOW GOOD
PLAYERS PLAY.

714
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,819
IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT, IT
COULD BE A $1 MILLION VOTE AT

715
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,087
THE END.

716
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,324
I THINK ANGELINA DID PROBABLY
WANT TO HAVE A HUMAN MOMENT WITH

717
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,558
ELIZABETH.

718
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:11,162
WHAT HURTS ME IS HOW THEY CAN
EXPECT IF SHE HEARS HER NAME TO

719
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,330
NOT WANT TO PLAY.

720
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,999
I FEEL LIKE ELIZABETH IS
BASICALLY TRYING TO THROW US A

721
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,635
LIFELINE AND TRYING TO POINT OUT
WHERE THERE MAY BE A FRACTURE.

722
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,738
IM SORRY THAT ITS YOU,
ANGELINA, BUT YOU CANT BE

723
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,506
INSULTED THAT ELIZABETH WANTS TO
PLAY.

724
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,875
IM NOT INSULTED WITH THE
PLAY, GABBY.

725
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,012
SHE WANTS TO HELP HER FORMER
TRIBE, BECAUSE THE FACT OF THE

726
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,347
MATTER IS WERE AT THE BOTTOM.

727
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,584
I CANT IMAGINE WHAT THAT
FEELS LIKE, WELL, I KIND OF CAN

728
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,220
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT BE
RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.

729
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,722
BUT THEYRE TRYING TO FRACTURE
US.

730
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,590
THEYRE USING ME TO TRY TO GET
THE NUMBERS BACK.

731
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,660
OBVIOUSLY YOU THINK WERE
GOING TO SIT HERE AND GET PICKED

732
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:43,461
OFF ONE BY ONE.

733
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,562
OBVIOUSLY!

734
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,830
OBVIOUSLY!

735
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:50,301
I DONT FAULT YOU FOR IT, BUT
I AM CHECKING IN WITH MY TRIBE.

736
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,270
YOUR NAME IS NOT OUT THERE,
GABBY.

737
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,504
YOUR NAME IS NOT OUT THERE.

738
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,207
I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WEVE
BEEN AT THE BOTTOM THIS WHOLE

739
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,441
TIME SO WERE USED TO IT.

740
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,877
OKAY, THE STRUGGLE WAS REAL.

741
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,013
JABENI WAS AT THE BOTTOM, TOO, I
FEEL YOU GIRL.

742
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,216
I SHOULD HAVE JUST LIED, JEFF,
BECAUSE NOW ALL OF THIS IS

743
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:09,120
HAPPENING, BUT WHAT PEOPLE KNOW
ABOUT ME IS I AM AN AUTHENTIC

744
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,857
PERSON, AND THIS GAME IS HARD
FOR SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO BE

745
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,825
A LOVING PERSON BECAUSE YOU HAVE
TO CUT PEOPLE.

746
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:19,430
Jeff: BUT ANGELINA, WHETHER
YOU MEANT IT OR NOT IS A LITTLE

747
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,531
IRRELEVANT.

748
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,466
PEOPLE HAVE A PERCEPTION, SO HOW
DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT?

749
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,769
AGAIN, IT WAS NOT JURY
MANAGE.

750
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,938
IT WAS A RAW HUMAN MOMENT WHERE
I COULDNT LIE.

751
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,073
I APOLOGIZE TO MY TRIBE.

752
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,441
I WASNT TRYING TO BE SNEAKY.

753
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,610
YEAH, YOU WERE TRYING TO BE
SNEAKY.

754
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,914
I THINK THAT ITS IMPORTANT THAT
THE GOLIATHS KNOW THAT THERE ARE

755
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:37,948
FRACTURES.

756
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,650
Jeff: WHAT IS YOUR HOPE FOR
TONIGHT, ELIZABETH?

757
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:44,422
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE
DAVIDS STICK TOGETHER WITH ONE

758
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,324
OR TWO GOLIATHS.

759
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,627
GOLIATH GOT HIS HEAD CHOPPED OFF
BECAUSE HE WAS AR GAPTD AND HE

760
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,828
THOUGHT HE HAD IT.

761
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,197
I FEEL LIKE THAT SAME ATTITUDE
IS GOING ON WITH THE GOLIATHS.

762
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,168
ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH THE
FRACTURES NOW OR LATER?

763
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:00,071
IM HOPING ONE WERE TO PEOPLE
WILL JOIN THE DAVID SIDE.

764
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,541
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE DAVID
SIDE DOES WANT TO BE STRONG.

765
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:07,044
Jeff: ANGELINA, ARE YOU
CONCERNED THAT ELIZABETHS BIG

766
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,212
SWING MIGHT END UP HITTING YOU.

767
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:11,482
I SURE HOPE NOT, JEFF,
BECAUSE I FEEL REALLY STRONGLY

768
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,451
ABOUT THE ALLIANCE THAT IM IN.

769
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:17,788
IF I HAD ANY HESITATION TODAY TO
WRITE DOWN ELIZABETHS NAME, IT

770
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,923
IS ALL GONE NOW.

771
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,058
IM EXCITED TO GO VOTE FOR
ELIZABETH AND I HOPE THAT OUR

772
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:27,431
TEAM STAYS STRONG IN THAT
DECISION TO DO SO.

773
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:27,932
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

774
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,934
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

775
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:34,972
CARL, YOURE UP.

776
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:54,458
SERIOUSLY.

777
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,127
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT.

778
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,166
I HOPE YOU GO HOME.

779
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:23,220
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

780
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,157
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

781
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:32,763
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

782
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:33,731
OKAY.

783
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,965
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

784
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,169
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

785
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,437
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

786
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,839
ILL READ THE VOTES.

787
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:46,277
FIRST VOTE, ANGELINA.

788
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,948
ELIZABETH.

789
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:56,887
ELIZABETH.

790
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:57,888
ELIZABETH.

791
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,358
THATS THREE VOTES ELIZABETH,
ONE VOTE ANGELINA.

792
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:01,992
ELIZABETH.

793
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:05,296
THATS FOUR VOTES ELIZABETH.

794
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:05,930
ELIZABETH.

795
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,097
THATS FIVE VOTES ELIZABETH.

796
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,701
ONE VOTE ANGELINA.

797
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:11,669
ELIZABETH.

798
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,438
SIX VOTES ELIZABETH.

799
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,542
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

800
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,643
ELIZABETH.

801
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:26,383
SEVEN, THATS ENOUGH, YOU NEED
TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

802
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,786
WELL, JEFF, MIGUEL WAS TO
COME IN AND HAVE AND BE MYSELF,

803
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,687
AND I DID.

804
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,454
Jeff: WELL DONE.

805
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:35,159
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

806
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:35,893
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

807
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:36,894
GOOD LUCK YOU GUYS.

808
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,129
I LOVE YOU ALL.

809
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:39,663
I REALLY DO.

810
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,332
SEE YOU, ELIZABETH.

811
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,734
FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING IT.

812
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:47,171
Jeff: WELL, DESPITE A
UNANIMOUS VOTE, ITS CLEAR FROM

813
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:51,375
TONIGHTS TRIBAL COUNCIL THAT
THIS GROUP OF 12 IS ANYTHING BUT

814
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,209
UNITED.

815
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:52,877
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

816
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,911
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

817
00:41:53,944 --> 00:42:03,554
GOOD NIGHT.

 Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

821
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,658
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

822
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,866
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," WHEN TRUST DISSOLVE

823
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,700
DISSOLVES.

824
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:17,401
I FEEL MANIPULATED.

825
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,570
ANGELINA, YOU SLIMEBAL.

826
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,838
Jeff: AND BONDS CRUMBLE.

827
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,375
GABBY IS NOT TAKING THIS
ALLIANCE SERIOUSLY.

828
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,809
THATS A WEIRD THING TO SAY.

829
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,511
Jeff: NO ONE IS SAFE.

830
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,746
SO WE TAKE HIM OUT NEXT?

831
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,949
IT COULD BE A
#BROCHACHOBLINDSIDE.

832
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:35,152
WELL, I GOT VOTED OUT.

833
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,421
I DID WHAT I COULD.

834
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:42,126
IT FELL ON DEAF EARS, BUT I
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT SOME CRACKS

835
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,828
ARE BUILT IN THE GOLIATH TRIBE,
BECAUSE I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO

836
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,031
SEE A DAVID WIN THIS GAME.

837
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,668
I STILL LOVE "SURVIVOR" MORE
THAN I EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE AND

838
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,703
I STILL HAD A GREAT TIME
