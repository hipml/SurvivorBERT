112
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:47,769
NOT LIKING BRAD.

IT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE SITTING

PISSED OFF.

129
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:21,344
>> YEAH.

130
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,471
IT'S BEST BEING ON THE FRONT

131
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,307
HERE.

132
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,226
>> IT'S BEST BEING THE CABOOSE.

133
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:28,768
THE GIFT IS IN THE GIVING.

134
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,770
>> IT'S HARD TO CONCENTRATE.

135
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,354
>> AS SOON AS RUPERT WAS TAKEN

136
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,439
AWAY, AND I WAS BY MYSELF, MY

137
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,567

AS FAR AS CONSIDERATION FOR

142
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:47,620
OTHERS, IT'S BEEN A BLESSING.

143
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,871
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A PART

144
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,580
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

145
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,457
>> I THOUGHT, LIKE, THIS WHOLE

146
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,502
ZEN, CALM, YOGA MENTALITY WOULD

00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,545
BE APPEALING TO ME.

148
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,673
WELL, IT WAS FOR, LIKE, THREE

149
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:58,881
DAYS.

150
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,465
NOW I'M OVER IT.

151
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,843
I CAME TO PLAY "SURVIVOR."

152
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,761
I DIDN'T COME TO PLAY RED ROVER.

153
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,305
>> "SURVIVOR" IS PATIENCE.

154
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,348
IT'S 39 DAYS.

155
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,267
AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE PATIENT.

156
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,851
>> I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH

157
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,394
THESE PEOPLE.

158
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,354
I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE THE

159
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,273
FINAL NINE.

160
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,567
LIKE, I LOVE CALEB WITH EVERY

161
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,111
FIBER OF MY BEING, AND I-- I

JUST NEED TO GET TO HIM.

163
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,531
HIM.

164
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,867
HONESTLY, SHE CAME UP TO ME AND

165
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,994
TRIED TO THROW YOU UNDER THE

166
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:28,286
BUS.

167
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,412
SHE'S GETTING ALL CAUGHT UP IN

168
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,038
HER STORIES.

169
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,707
>> I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THAT

170
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,915
TALK.

171
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,750
LET'S FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW.

172
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,044
IF WE PLAY THE GAME EIGHT STEPS

173
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,712
IN ADVANCE, WE'RE GOING TO BE IN

174
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,797
TROUBLE.

175
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:39,922
>>

176
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,758
>> SHUT IT DOWN.

177
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,217
NOBODY TALK STRATEGY AGAIN UNTIL

178
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:43,760
WE LOSE OUR FIRST CHALLENGE.

179
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,553
THEN WE CAN TALK AFTER THAT.

180
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,390
>> I HAD REALLY HOPED COLTON HAD

181
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,685
SEEN THE WAY HE PLAYED AND WHICH

182
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,561
CHANGED BUT YOU CAN ONLY FAKE IT

183
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,104
FOR SO LONG.

184
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,315
YOU CAN COME OUT HERE AND FAKE

185
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,192
IT FOR FOUR DAYS, FIVE DAYS BUT

186
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,694
THE ELEMENTS GET TO YOU AND YOUR

187
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,071
TRUE PERSONALITY EMERGES.

188
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,906
>> I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

189
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,573
ANYTHING BUT "SURVIVOR."

190
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,200
>> STRATEGY?

191
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:07,617
WHAT IS STRATEGY?

192
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,618
WE ARE A UNIT.

193
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,452
WE ARE UNITY.

194
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,329
WE ARE PEACE.

195
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,623
WE ARE ZEN.

196
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:52,245
WE ARE STUPID!

197
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,579
>> WE FEEL GREAT THIS MORNING.

198
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,456
WE GOT FLINT LAST NIGHT.

199
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:55,998
IT WAS UNFORTUNATE WE HAD TO

200
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,583
LOSE A TRIBE MEMBER TO GET A

201
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,002
FLINT, BUT WE GOT THE FLINT.

202
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,879
KIND OF SHOWED SOME OF THE GUYS

203
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,673
HOW TO USE THE HAWAIIAN SLING.

204
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,216
WE GOT SOME FISH.

205
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,761
GIVE A MAN A FISH HE EATS FOR

206
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:08,970
DAYS.

207
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,931
TEACH A MAN TO FISH AND THE

208
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,349
WHOLE TRIBE EATS, SOMETHING LIKE

209
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:13,516
THAT.

210
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,643
>> I HAVE A FEELING I'M MORE AT

211
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,562
RISK IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW THAN

212
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,104
TYSON IS.

213
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,230
I THINK ALLIANCES ARE JUST

214
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,189
STARTING TO FORM.

215
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:20,815
I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE GOING

216
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,775
ON THAN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE JUST

217
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,526
AT CAMP.

218
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,236
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL IS SUCH A

219
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,779
BUMMER.

220
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,238
BUMMER.

221
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,616
>> YOU DIDN'T BOND WITH MARISSA?

222
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,993
>> NO, NO, NO.

223
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,661
>> WHO ALL WROAPT THE SAD FACES

224
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,871
LAST NIGHT?

225
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,580
>> I DID.

226
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:35,872
>> I DID.

227
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,332
>> THOSE ARE ALL GIRL VOTES, I

228
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:38,541
THINK.

229
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,625
>> I'M A GIRL IN THIS TRIBE.

230
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,001
I'M A MINORITY.

231
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,253
AND I AM LIVING IN A MAN'S WORLD

232
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,880
RIGHT NOW.

233
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,299
WHICH IS WHY MY STRATEGY IS TO

234
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,509
REALLY PLAY IT COOL WITH THE

235
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,761
GUYS, BEING WITH THE GUYS AND

236
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,556
TRY TO JUST WORK WITH THEM.

237
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,724
I'M ON BOARD WITH YOU.

238
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,475
I TRUST YOU.

239
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:56,893
>> YUP.

240
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,354
I LIKE YOU.

241
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,898
>> WE WORK WELL TOGETHER.

242
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,315
>> YEAH.

243
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,483
>> THE FACT THAT RACHEL IS NOT

244
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,526
STRATEGIZING WITH THE GIRLS AT

245
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,944
THIS POINT, WHO YOU KIND OF

246
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,738
ASSUME SHE WOULD BE CLOSEST

247
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,781
WITH, IS REALLY FISHY TO ME, AND

248
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,951
I AM 75% CONFIDENT THAT RACHEL

249
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,412
AND JOHN HAVE AN ALLIANCE.

250
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,080
>> I THINK THAT THERE IS AN

251
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,875
ALLIANCE BETWEEN JOHN AND

252
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,083
RACHEL.

253
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:21,584
BE CAUTIOUS OF IT.

254
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,753
I'VE DEFINITELY TAKEN IT IT UPON

255
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,380
MYSELF TO LET PEOPLE KNOW-- JOHN

256
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,715
HAS AN ALLIANCE IN THE TRIBE.

257
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,467
IT PUTS A BIG RED FLAG ON JOHN

258
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,092
WHICH IS GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE

259
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,553
THE RED FLAG IS NOT ON ME.

260
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,179
>> WHAT.

261
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,222
>> TREE MAIL!

262
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:34,847
>> OH!

263
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,515
>> YEAH!

264
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,809
>> GATHER AROUND.

265
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,102
"SO IT IS TIME FOR THE ENTIRE

266
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,104

IN THIS GAME AND WHO GOES HOME

FOR GOOD."

271
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,653
>> WE'RE ALL GOING.

272
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,528
>> YEAH!

273
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:49,987

274
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,365
THE WHOLE TRIBE IS GOING TO

REDEMPTION ISLAND.

276
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,036
>> GO, CANDICE.

277
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,829
>> IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR ME

278
00:08:58,913 --> 00:08:59,121
EMOTIONALLY.

279
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,332
I'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH A LOT

280
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:01,958
OF DIFFICULT FEELINGS OF GUILT.

281
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,252
IF CANDICE LOOKS AT ME AND

282
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:04,835
SMILES AND SAYS SHE LOVES ME,

283
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,504
HONESTLY, THAT WOULD TAKE THIS

284
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,630
WEIGHT THAT'S JUST CRUSHING MY

285
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,674
HEART RIGHT NOW, IT WOULD JUST

286
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:14,845
THROW IT OFF.

287
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:27,525
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

288
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,776
GALANG GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK

WE HAVEN'T EVEN BROUGHT IN THE

00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,081
COMPETITORS, AND ALREADY, FOUR

294
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,374
OF YOU ARE CRYING.

295
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,750
IS IT JUST SEEING THEM?

296
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,793
>> NO, IT'S THE HEARTACHE.

297
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,628
I WANTED TO RUN THE WHOLE WAY.

298
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,589
>> IT'S SEEING THEM SAFE.

299
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,092
>> Jeff: SUDDENLY KNOWING WHO

300
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,386
IT IS IS WHO WAS VOTED OUT IS

301
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,596
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER.

302
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,388

RUPERT.

307
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,980

311
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,577
MARISSA, YOU GAVE A BIG, LONG

312
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,911
STARE TO YOUR TRIBE THAT JUST

313
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,412
VOTED YOU OUT.

314
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,538
>> I DID.

315
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,080
BECAUSE I DON'T, I SHOULD BE

316
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,498
HERE AT ALL.

317
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,000
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PERSON

318
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,543
WHO SHOULD GO TO REDEMPTION

319
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,503
SHOULD BE BASED OFF OF THEIR

320
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:29,795
PERFORMANCE.

321
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,380
MY PERFORMANCE DOES DNOT LOSE

322
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,715
OUR CHALLENGE.

323
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,967
GERVAIS, THE REASONING I GOT

324
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:35,885
FROM MY TRIBE WAS THAT YOU

325
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,429
BURNED THE TRIBE WITH YOUR

326
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:38,721
CELEBRATION.

327
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,222
YOU RUBBED SALT IN THEIR OPEN

328
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,807
WOUND, AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

329
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,602
>> I'M GOING TO RUB SOME MORE.

330
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,063
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

331
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,273
>> Jeff: DURING THE SEASON OF

332
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,691
"BLOOD VERSUS WATER" YOU HAVE

333
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,985
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SWAP SPOTS

334
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,861
WITH YOUR LOVED ONE.

335
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,446
IF YOU DON'T SWAP, THIS COULD BE

336
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:05,831
IT FOR MARISSA RIGHT HERE.

337
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,749
GERVASE IS GOING TO KEEP IT

338
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,583
WHERE IT IS.

339
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,043
FOR TODAY'S DUEL, YOU WILL USE A

340
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,088
LONG POLE TO MANEUVER A WOODEN

341
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:12,838
SPOOL THROUGH A CHANNEL.

342
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,923
ONCE YOU GET TO THE TOP, YOU'LL

343
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,924
PLACE YOUR SPOOL, HEAD BACK TO

344
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,634
THE NEXT ONE.

345
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,636
TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT, THE

346
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,512
ENTIRE STRUCTURE SITS ON A

347
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,554
SPRING, WHICH MEANS IF YOU TOUCH

348
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,098
IT, IT WILL WOBBLE.

349
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,766
AND YOUR SPOOLS MAY FALL.

350
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,184
AND YOU HAVE TO START OVER.

351
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,521
THE FIRST TWO TO GET ALL 10 OF

352
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,357

IN ADDITION, THERE IS ONE ADDED

356
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,030
ELEMENT.

357
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,824
THE FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WILL

358
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,202
GET TO DECIDE WHAT GETS A CLUE

359
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,163
TO THE LOCATION OF A HIDDEN

360
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:46,497
IMMUNITY IDOL.

361
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,541
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FAIR LITTLE

362
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:48,749
POWER.

363
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,000
YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ANYONE YOU

364
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,670
WANT ON ANY TRIBE FOR WHATEVER

365
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:52,920
REASON.

366
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:53,963
A LOT GOING ON.

367
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,464
LET'S GET STARTED.

GO.

377
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,488
IT REQUIRES A DELICATE

378
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,658
COMBINATION OF SPEED, DEXTERITY,

379
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,868
TO WHICH RUPERT IS THROWING

380
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,412
CAUTION TO THE WIND AND BLOWING

381
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:26,787
THROUGH THIS.

382
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,831
AND HE'S TALL ENOUGH HE DOESN'T

383
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,459
EVEN NEED THE STEPS BUT IT FALLS

384
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:31,625
OFF.

385
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,835
PICK THEM UP AND GO BACK TO THE

386
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,002
START.

387
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,004
IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD TO RUSH

388
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,924
IF IT'S GOING TO FALL.

389
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,677
CANDICE HAS HER FIRST ONE.

390
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,136
MARISSA HAS HER FIRST.

391
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,138
THERE ARE 10 TOTAL.

392
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,516
YOU HAVE TO STACK ALL OF THEM.

393
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,560
RUPERT HAS HIS FIRST.

394
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,353
CANDICE IS ON HER SECOND.

395
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,022
OUT TO AN EARLY LEAD.

396
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:53,939
MARISSA TAKING HER TIME,

397
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,316
STARTING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

398
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:55,858
IT'S ONE THING TO GET THERE.

399
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,027
THEN YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR STACK

400
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,321
NICE AND STRAIGHT BECAUSE THE

401
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,739
TALLER IT GETS THE MORE LIKELY

402
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:15,002
IT IS TO FALL.

403
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,505
CANDICE PLACES HER SEVENTH.

404
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,672
RUPERT PLACES HIS SEVENTH.

405
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,882
IT IS NOW CAPPEDIS AND RUPERT.

406
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,926
MARISSA IS TRYING TO PLACE THAT

407
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,802
SIXTH ONE.

408
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,970
CANDICE WORKING ON HER EIGHTH.

409
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,889
RUPERT NOW WORKING ON HIS

410
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,097
EIGHTH.

411
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,058
THE WIND IS STARTING TO PICK UP.

412
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,850
CANDICE HAS HER EIGHTH.

413
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,312
RUPERT TRYING TO PLACE HIS

414
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:38,734
EIGHTH.

415
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,779
RUPERT PLACES HIS EIGHTH, BUT

416
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,947
THAT STACK IS LEANING.

417
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,325
CANDICE PLACING HER NINTH.

418
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,953
>> SLOW AND STEADY, BABE.

419
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:55,251
>> Jeff: MARISSA PLACING HER

420
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,044
SEVENTH.

421
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,214
JUST LIKE THAT, RUPERT LOSING

422
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,715
HIS HEN TIRE STACK.

423
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,509
RUPERT LOST EVERYTHING BUT HIS

424
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,635
FIRST SPOOL.

425
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,053
CANDICE VERY CLOSE TO WINNING

426
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,888
THIS AND STAYING ALIVE.

427
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,641
SHE'LL NUMBER CHARGE OF WHO GETS

428
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,978
THAT CLUE IF SHE CAN JUST PLACE

429
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:14,186
THIS.

430
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,772
VERY TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE AT THE

431
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:16,939
TOP.

432
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,691
IT'S EASY TO KNOCK THE ENTIRE

433
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:25,906
STACK OVER.

434
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,490
>> JEFF.

435
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,950
>> Jeff: ONE, TWO, THREE, CAND

436
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,617
SIS GOOD.

437
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,994
TAKE A SPOT BEHIND YOUR DECK.

438
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,162
WE ARE NOW DOWN TO TWO.

439
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,080
ONE PERSON IS GOING TO STAY

440
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:33,289
ALIVE.

441
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,624
ONE WILL BE OUT OF THIS GAME.

442
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,083
>> TAKE YOUR TIME NOW!

443
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,420
TAKE YOUR TIME!

444
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,797
>> Jeff: MARISSA PLACES HER

445
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,006
NINTH.

446
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,923
SHE HAS ONE LEFT.

447
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,760
RUPERT NOW WORKING ON HIS FIFTH.

448
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,387
MARISSA ON HER TENTH, AND COULD

449
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,098
BE FINAL SPOOL.

450
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,517
TO STAY ALIVE ALL SHE HAS TO DO

451
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,768
IS GET IT ON TOP OF THAT STACK

452
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,021
AND HOLD IT FOR THREE SECONDS.

453
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,897
>> GET YOUR ELBOWS UP!

454
00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,898
MAKE IT LEVEL.

455
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:05,112
GET YOUR ELBOWS UP IN THE BACK.

456
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,948
GEEZ.

457
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,784
>> Jeff: THREE, TWO, ONE.

458
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,829
MARISSA STAYS ALIVE.

459
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:14,121
>> NICE JOB!

460
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,165
>> Jeff: SHE JOINS CAND TOIS

461
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,335
CONTINUE ON IN HER QUEST FOR A

462
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,378
MILLION DOLLARS.

463
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,421
>> I'M SORRY.

464
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,298
>> GOOD JOB, BABE.

465
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:24,965
>> YOU'LL BE FINE.

466
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,592
I'M FINE.

467
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,010
YOU'LL BE FINE.

468
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,137
YOU'LL BE FINE.

00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:33,766
CONGRATULATIONS.

471
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,516
YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU NEEDED TO

472
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,562
DO TO STAY ALIVE IN THIS GAME.

473
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:38,812
RUPERT.

474
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,065
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

475
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,816
FIRST ONE OUT.

476
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,275
NEVER WENT TO TRIBAL.

477
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,694
NEVER GOT A VOTE.

478
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,236
>> Jeff: REGRET THE MOVE YOU

479
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,445
MADE?

480
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,946
>> NOT AT ALL.

481
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,364
I HAVE NO REGRETS.

482
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,159
THIS IS A GREAT GAME, AND I LOVE

483
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:52,451
"SURVIVOR."

484
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,037
BUT I LOVE MY WIFE MORE.

485
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,497

FOR THIS JOURNEY ON "SURVIVOR,"

487
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,167
YOUR TIME HAS COME TO AN END.

488
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,126
>> YES, SIR.

489
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,253
>> Jeff: RUPERT, GRAB YOUR

490
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:03,462
STUFF.

491
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,047
THROW YOUR BUFF IN THE URN ON

492
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,756
THE WAY OUT.

493
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,007
IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

494
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,634
>> I LOVE YOU.

495
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:15,933

>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, CANDICE,

498
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,365
AS REWARD FOR WINNING THIS DUEL,

00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,534
YOU GET TO DECIDE WHO GETS A

500
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,577
CLUE TO THE LOCATION OF A HIDDEN

501
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,161
IMMUNITY IDOL.

502
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,371
YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ANYBODY YOU

503
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,080
WANT FOR ANY REASON.

504
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,164
A LOT OF STRATEGY.

505
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,499
WHO DO YOU WANT TO GIVE IT TO?

506
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,959
>> NOT A LOT TO THINK ABOUT

507
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:42,251
HERE, JEFF.

508
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,294
YOU KNOW WHO IT'S GOING TO.

00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,088
HUSBAND

511
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,174
>> MY BABY.

512
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,134
>> Jeff: JOHN, THIS IS THE

513
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,136
CLUE TO A LOCATION OF A HIDDEN

514
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,554
IMMUNITY IDOL.

515
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,263
WHAT YOU DO WITH IT IS UP TO

516
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:54,430
YOU.

517
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,599
>> I LOVE YOU, BABE.

518
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,143

00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,477
>> Jeff: CANDICE AND MARISSA.

GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK TO

522
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,233
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

523
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,652
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

524
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,445
HEAD ON BACK TO CAMP.

525
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,448
>> I AM SO PUMPED THAT CANDICE

526
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,991
KICKED SO MUCH ASS.

527
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,367
I HAD ALL THESE GUILTY FEELINGS

528
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,704
AND SHE JUST TOOK THEM OFF THE

529
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,747
TABLE.

530
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,623
NOW I HAVE A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN

531
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:21,957
IMMUNITY IDOL.

532
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:39,266
THIS IS, LIKE, INCREDIBLE.

533
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,851
>> JOHN, CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

534
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:41,310
<i>( APPLAUSE ).</i>

535
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:41,852
>> AND SHE LOOKED FANTASTIC.

536
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,854
>> I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN THE

537
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,272
AMOUNT OF PRIDE AND HOPENESS I

538
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,315
HAD IN SEEING CANDICE JUST,

539
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,860
LIKE, DOMINATE.

540
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,779
I DIDN'T LOVE THE FACT THAT

541
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,154
MARISSA WON.

542
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,366
SHE IS SO PISSED.

543
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,534
>> SHE'S ANGRY.

544
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,578
>> I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE RUPERT

545
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,330
OUT THERE THAN MARISSA.

546
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,123
I WANT TO HAVE AS MANY WEEK

547
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,459
PEOPLE AROUND CANDICE AS HUMANLY

548
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:05,709
POSSIBLE.

549
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,378
IF BOTH PEOPLE OUT THERE SUCK

550
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,047
AND ARE WEAK IN CHALLENGES, I'M

551
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,255
HAPPY.

552
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,423
>> HERE'S THE INTERESTING THING.

553
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,510
OUR NEW TWIST IT'S PERSON WE

554
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,928
VOTE OUT HAS THE CHANCE TO SWAP.

555
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,971
WHO HAS THE MOST LIKELY CHANCE

556
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,808
TO SWAP ARE PLAYERS WHO PLAYED

557
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,183
THE GAME.

558
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,185
WHO DO WE WANT OUT OF THE TRIBE?

559
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,561
>> TYSON.

560
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,522
>> FOR EXAMPLE, RACHEL WOULD BE

561
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,940
THE NEXT TO GO AND TYSON WOULD

562
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,608
HAVE A REALLY TOUGH TIME NOT

563
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,484
SWITCHING AND THAT WOULD MAKE

564
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,819
THEIR TRIBE A LOT WEAKER.

565
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,695
>> I DO AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE

566
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:33,904
SAYING.

567
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,364
WE'RE KIND OF GOING ON

568
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,240
SUPPOSITION ON THAT ONE.

569
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,700
>> THAT IS A NO-BRAINER.

570
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,953
FOR A SELFISH REASON I HAVE NOT

571
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,664
WANTING TO VOTE RACHEL OUT IS IF

572
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,207
IN FACT TYSON SWITCHES PLACES

573
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,459
WITH HER HE'S GOING AGAINST

574
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,794
CANDICE AT REDEMPTION ISLAND,

575
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,046
AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT

576
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:51,380
NOT HAPPEN.

577
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,340
>> IF YOU CAN FIND THAT IDOL, WE

578
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,258
KNOW WHO DOESN'T HAVE IT.

579
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,801
THAT'S SO KEY.

580
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,553
>> WE HAVE OUR FIVE GUYS STRONG.

581
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,097
IF WE STAY SOLID, WE GO PAST THE

582
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,139
MERGE AND EVERYTHING.

583
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:01,723
>> RIGHT.

584
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,267
>> THEN WE USE IT TO HELP US.

585
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,184
>> JOHN IS WITH US.

586
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,435
AND I LIKE THE KID.

587
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,812
I I THINK HE IS SOLID.

588
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,021
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR HIM TO

589
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:08,605
HAVE THE CLUE BECAUSE GET, THE

590
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,440
CLUE IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY IS A

591
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,483
CURSE AND A BLESSING.

592
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,276
I MEAN, IT'S A BLESSING IN THE

593
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,695
SENSE YOU'VE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY

594
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,363
TO FIND THE IDOL.

595
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,240
IT'S A CURSE IN THE SENSE YOU

596
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,157
HAVE A TARGET.

597
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,325
>> WE HAVE SUCH A GOOD THING

598
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:20,534
GOING.

599
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,620
>> LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

600
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,414
>> BETWEEN YOUR CAMP AND FRESH

601
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,206
WATER ARE YOU GOING TO SEE A

602
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,415
TREE.

603
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,251
PAY ATTENTION WHERE YOU WALK OR

604
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,377
YOU MAY STUMBLE OVER IMMUNITY.

605
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,088
I HAVE OI DECISION POINT TO

606
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:33,297
MAKE.

607
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,881
THERE'S A FORK IN THE ROAD.

608
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,133
DO I GO THIS WAY AND TELL THE

609
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,426
GUYS IN MY ALLIANCE OR FIND A

610
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,844
WAY TO RUN OFF IN SECRET AND

611
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,387
FIND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

612
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,596
MYSELF?

613
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,931
I THINK I'M KIND OF BE PRIVATE

614
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,515
ABOUT IT AND MAKE SURE I'M THE

615
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,312
ONLY ONE WHO CAN FIND IT.

616
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,943
>> THAT WAS BRUTAL.

617
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,069
>> THAT WAS ROUGH.

618
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,489
>> I AM SURPRISINGLY OKAY WITH

619
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,032
THIS.

620
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,283
>> ARE YOU DOING REMARKABLE.

621
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,326
>> LOOK AT THAT.

622
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,202
>> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE

623
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,370
OF RELIEF THAT I DON'T HAVE TO

624
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:05,746
WORRY ABOUT HIM.

625
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,456
I DON'T HAVE MY DREAM OF PLAYING

626
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,957
WITH MY HUSBAND, BUT WE'RE-- I'M

627
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,626
NOT A TARGET ANYMORE.

628
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,543
I'M NOT TWO.

629
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,337
I'M ONE.

630
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,006
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M IN MIDDLE

631
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,132
SCHOOL AGAIN.

632
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,468
I DON'T MIND CAMPFIRE-SIDE CHATS

633
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,261
OR WHATEVER, BUT THAT'S ALL THEY

634
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,638
WANT TO DO.

635
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,305
>> I'M GOING TO BE OKAY, YOU

636
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:23,472
GUYS.

637
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,432
>> I WAS IMPRESSED.

638
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,143
>> IT WILL EMPOWER ME AND MAKE

639
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,145
ME WANT TO BEAT THE OTHER TEAM.

640
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,856
>> DO WE THINK THIS IS A

641
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,274
Y.M.C.A. CAMPING TRIP WHERE WE

642
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,818
TALK ABOUT IMPROVING OURSELVES.

643
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,861
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT?

644
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,280
I WANT TO IMPROVE MYSELF BY WIN

645
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,282
$1 MILLION.

646
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,325
>> TYSON TOLD ME THAT THEY WANT

647
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,994
TO GET RID OF YOU.

648
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,620
>> WOW.

649
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,412
>> IT'S NOT HARD FOR ME TO,

650
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,456
LIKE, TWIST THE STORY AND LIE TO

651
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,999
SOMEONE TO BENEFIT ME IN THIS

652
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,921
GAME.

653
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,129
GAME.

654
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,465
>> IF I CAN GET ALL OF THIS ZEN

655
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,510
AND ZAHN OUT OF HERE, I CAN RUN

656
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,512
THIS SHOW.

657
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,473
>> WAS HE STRATEGIZING AGAINST

658
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,724
ME.

659
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:07,849
>>

660
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,393
>> NO IT'S THINKING WHAT IF THAT

661
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,021
TEAM LOSES, THEN WHAT DO WE DO?

662
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,773
I'M LIKE I DON'T KNOW.

663
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,401
YOU KNOW?

664
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,112
>> I DO WANT TO PLAY AGAINST

665
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:20,362
COLTON.

666
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:20,904
I CAN'T HAVE HIM AGAINST ME

667
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,781
BECAUSE HE WILL TOWRN ME.

668
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,700
HE LOST THAT STUFF.

669
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,493
LIKE, HE THRIVES ON, THAT AND

670
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:30,789
IT'S SICK.

671
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,331
>> TINA SAID THAT SHE WAS

672
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,959
ACTUALLY FREAKED OUT BECAUSE

673
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,669
YOU'RE OVER-STRATEGIZING WITH

674
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,169
HER.

675
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,754
>> WHAT DID SHE SAY?

676
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,256
>> YOU'RE SO INTERESTED IN WHAT

677
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:39,798
SHE SAID BECAUSE YOU KNOW

678
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,009
SOMETHING SHE SAID YOU TOLD HER

679
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:42,718
TO NOT TELL ME.

680
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,344
>> I'M JUST GOING TO GET HER.

681
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,140
>> WAIT NO, STOP, STOP.

682
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,808
>> EITHER YOU'RE GOING TO TELL

683
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,227
ME WHAT SHE SAID OR I'M GOING TO

684
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,228
GO GET HER.

685
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,814
>> DON'T MAKE A HUGE SCENE, SIT

686
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,023
DOWN.

687
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:56,565
>> TELL ME WHAT SHE SAID.

688
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,108
>> DON'T KNOW.

689
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,652
>> WHEN I'M INGERY I TURN INTO A

690
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,779
RAGING BITCH, AND HOPEFULLY THE

691
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,823
CAMP WILL ERUPT INTO CHAOS

692
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,866
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING I

693
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,743
KNOW I CAN RULE IN CHAOS.

694
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,452
WHAT DID TINA SAY TO YOU.

695
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,578
>> I TOLD YOU.

696
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,372
>> YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

697
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,665
WHAT DOES DSHE SAY?

698
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,375
>> THAT WE WERE

699
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:15,917
OVERSTRATEGIZING.

700
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,337
>> NO, YOUR EXACT WORDS WERE

701
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,714
TINA CAME UP TO YOU OUT OF THE

702
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,967
WATER AND SAID COLTON IS TOTALLY

703
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:24,384
OVERSTRATEGIZING.

704
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,927
>> ALL DIWAS PULL YOU ASIDE TO

705
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,056
TALK US ABOUT US, THAT'S IT.

706
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,807
>> YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN BECAUSE

707
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,392
IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE GOING TO BE

708
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,561
COMPETING IN THAT DUEL NEXT

709
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:34,770
TIME.

710
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,564
>> SO THIS IS WHAT "SURVIVOR 27"

711
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,649
LOOKS LIKE? THERE IS SO MUCH

712
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:39,858
DRAMA.

713
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,443
YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH

714
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,486
DRAMA FOR 39 DAYS.

715
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,403
>> I CAN JUST SAY-- CAN I PLEASE

716
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,572
JUST SAY-- I JUST WANT TO

717
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,531
ADDRESS THE ENTIRE TRIBE AND

718
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,617
THIS IS ALL I'M GOING TO SAY.

719
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,619
IM ALL FOR BURYING THE HATCHET.

720
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,953
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE A

721
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,204
( BLEEP ).

722
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,080
I DON'T WANT TO BE A ( BLEEP ).

723
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,123
BUT I CANNOT FORGE FORWARD IN A

724
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:55,540
RELATIONSHIP WITH--

725
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,042
>> THIS DOESN'T MATTER TO MOST

726
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,168
OF US.

727
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,628
I KNOW AT LEAST FOR ME, I KNOW

728
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,756
FOR GERVASE, I KNOW FOR LAURA,

729
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,131
MONICA.

730
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,050
>> I WANT TO HAVE A PEACEFUL

731
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:05,258
CAMP.

732
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:05,717
AND I WANT TO WIN.

733
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,469
>> I HAD A FIGHT WITH AUSTIN.

734
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,263
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING WITH

735
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:10,472
COLTON.

736
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,765
I THINK HE CAME OUT HERE WANTING

737
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,141
TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE PERSON

738
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,476
HE WAS AND HE PRETENDED TO BE

739
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,269
FOR, LIKE, A DAY AND A HALF OR

740
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:16,812
SOMETHING.

741
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,563
BUT NOW YOU LOOK AT HIM AND

742
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,857
YOU'RE LIKE HE'S GOING TO END UP

743
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,650
OVER THINKING HIMSELF OUT OF THE

744
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:21,858
GAME.

745
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,569
>> RIGHT NOW LET'S JUST RELAX.

746
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,238
>> I TRIED TO GET TO THE TRUTH,

747
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,032
AND NOW IT'S LIKE LET'S ALL JUST

748
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:29,574
BE KUMBAYA-- WHATEVER.

749
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:34,538
I HOPE WE GO TO IMMUNITY

CHALLENGE TOMORROW AND GET

751
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,124
LEGISLATURED.

752
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,458
THESE PEOPLE NEED TO EXPERIENCE

753
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,626
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND REALIZE THIS

754
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,378
IS A GAME.

755
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,672
THIS ISN'T "NATIONAL LAMPOON'S

756
00:23:43,755 --> 00:24:05,861
HORRIBLE VACATION."

757
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,156
>> I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, AND

758
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:09,906
EVERYONE'S BEING SUPER SKETCHY

759
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,950
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

760
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,994
I DON'T KNOW IF THE VIBE-- IF

761
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:14,661
THE VIBE HAS GOTTEN THROWN OFF

762
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,622
OR WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON.

763
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:17,789
ON.

764
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,790
DO YOU THINK I'M IN TROUBLE?

765
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,374
>> NO.

766
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,417
>> REALLY.

767
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,711
>> I'LL KEEP MY EARS OPEN BUT

768
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,504
YOU NEED TO DECOMPRESS A LITTLE

769
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:24,671
BIT.

770
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,672
I LIKE COLTON, BUT FOR THE FIRST

771
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,091
TIME IN MY LIFE, I CAME TO PLAY

772
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,092
FOR ME.

773
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,635
AND THAT MONICA THAT'S JUST

774
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,637
GOING TO SIT IN MEDIOCRITY, SHE

775
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:40,020
DIED IN SAMOA.

776
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,356
>> UH-HUH.

777
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,025
>> IF HE SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT ANY

778
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,736
OF US TARGETING ONE OF YOU,

779
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,361
APPROACH US.

780
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:52,032
>> I SAW HIM THIS MORNING AND HE

781
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,992
SAID, "IS IT EVERYONE STILL ON

782
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,286
KAT OR ARE THEY ALL ON ME?"

783
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,704
SO HE KNOWS PEOPLE ARE ON HIM.

784
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,955
>> THIS GAME DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

785
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,456
A GAME.

786
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,624
FEAR AT ALL.

787
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,958
>> BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AFRAID.

788
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:02,626
>> I KNOW.

789
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,877
>> I'VE BEEN VERY AFRAID.

790
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,794
>> HE'S A BULLY.

791
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,796
THAT'S THE WAY HE PLAYS.

792
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,631
HE IS A GAY RUSSELL HANTZ.

793
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,549
I HAVE SEEN A SIDE OF COLTON

794
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,843
THAT IS NASTY.

795
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,761
WHAT HE DID TO KAT LAST NIGHT AT

796
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,138
OUR CAMP WAS BULLYING, AND IF HE

797
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,557
DID IT TO KAT, HE CAN DO IT TO

798
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:17,766
TYSON.

799
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,767
HE CAN DO IT TO ARAS.

800
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,980
HE CAN DO IT TO GERVASE.

801
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,482
AND AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU HAVE

802
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,150
TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH

803
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:27,442
THAT PERSON.

804
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,236
>> THIS IS THE FIVE TO THE END.

805
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,070
>> A NEW ALLIANCE HAS FORMED AND

806
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,739
IT IS TYSON ARAS, GERVASE, TINA,

807
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,615

808
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,659
AND I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT

809
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:40,455
THIS ALLIANCE.

810
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,290
WISDOM IS EXPERIENCE.

811
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:42,874
AND EVERYBODY IN THIS ALLIANCE

812
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,460

813
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,878
LOT OF LIFE EXPERIENCE.

814
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,796

LET'S-- DON'T SAY ANYTHING ON

816
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:50,423

00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,841
ONE, TWO, THREE, DON'T SAY

818
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:57,889

SWEAR I AM.

1054
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,225
>> WE WERE REALLY IN NEED OF

1055
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,976
THIS CHALLENGE NOT BECAUSE OF

1056
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,145
THE FISHING GEAR BUT WE NEED THE

1057
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:01,479
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1058
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,356
WE DON'T WANT TO SEND ANYONE

1059
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:03,564
HOME.

1060
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,732
THERE ARE THREE GIRLS LEFT.

1061
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,776
WE HAVE LOT OF GUYS, LOTS OF

1062
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,194
BRAWN, BUT THERE ARE ONLY THREE

1063
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:08,403
GIRLS.

1064
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,029
THE CHIS COULD PICK US OFF IF

1065
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,447
THEY WANTED TO.

1066
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,949
HOPEFULLY THEY WANT TO KEEP ME

1067
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:13,199
AROUND.

1068
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,826
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE OTHER

1069
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,119
GIRLS GO BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE

1070
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,162
PERSON WHO WINS THE GAME AND I

1071
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,248
HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO TO

1072
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,332
WIN.

1073
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,501
>> WE BOTH THINK RACHEL ONLY

1074
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,377
BECAUSE OF THE NEW TWIST.

1075
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,920
>> ALL THINGS BEING CONSIDERED

1076
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,213
THE THREE GIRLS ARE RELATIVELY

1077
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,715
EVEN, SO THE TYSON POSSIBILITY

1078
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,383
TO WEAKEN THEIR TRIBE KIND OF

1079
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,385
PUTS IT OVER THE EDGE.

1080
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,846
>> I WAS JUST, LIKE, IF TYSON

1081
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,515
DOESN'T TAKE HER PLACE, THEN

1082
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,099
LOSING RACHEL MAKES US WEAKER

1083
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,101
THAN LOSING ONE OF THE OTHER

1084
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,728
TWO.

1085
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,148
>> EVEN HE DOESN'T TWILL WEAKEN

1086
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,191
HIM TO A POINT.

1087
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,485
>> SHE IS THE ONLY GIRL WHO HAS

1088
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,279
SHOWN HE DOESN'T, LIKE, WANT TO

1089
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,029
BE PHYSICAL.

1090
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,281
>> NOT MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

1091
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,033
>> THE CONSENSUS IS RACHEL

1092
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:56,659
BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

1093
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,953
TYSON AND MAYBE TYSON WILL TAKE

1094
00:33:59,036 --> 00:33:59,537
RACHEL'S SPOT AT REDEMPTION

1095
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,122
ISLAND, AND THEREBY WEAKEN THEIR

1096
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:01,289
TRIBE.

1097
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,793
BUT FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT.

1098
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,794
>> DON'T REALLY WANT TO HAVE

1099
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,587
RACHEL GO TO REDEMPTION ISLAND,

1100
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,005
AND THEN HAVE TYSON SWITCH

1101
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,131
PLACES WITH HER BECAUSE THEN

1102
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,550
TYSON'S COMPETING AGAINST

1103
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:12,800
CANDICE.

1104
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,345
>> WE'RE GOING TO SAY-- DOES

00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,182
JOHN HAVE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FIVE

1106
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,350
GUYS OR TO RACHEL?

1107
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,101
DOUBTS HAVE ARISEN BECAUSE OF

1108
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,145
HIS EXTREME HESITANCY TO VOTE

1109
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,438
HER OUT.

1110
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,939
THIS EARLY IN THE GAME TO HAVE

1111
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,149
DOUBTS ARISE IS NOT A GOOD

1112
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:28,316
THING.

1113
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,318
>> WHAT WE CAME UP WITH IT IS

1114
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,862
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE RACHEL ARE

1115
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,154
PROBABLY.

1116
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:33,780
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

1117
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,115
>> YOU TALKED TO JOHN ABOUT

1118
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:36,866
THAT?

1119
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,450
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET RID OF

1120
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:37,617
HER.

1121
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,660
>> HE HAD A TOUGH TIME WITH IT.

1122
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,286
HE'S VERY--

1123
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,830
>> I HAVE A TOUGH TIME BELIEVE,

1124
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,123
THAT HE'S GOING TO WRITE HER

1125
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:44,582
NAME DOWN.

1126
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,166
>> EVEN IF HE DOESN'T PUT HER

1127
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,043
NAME DOWN--

1128
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,544
>> IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

1129
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,171
>> WAIT, HE HAS THE IDOL.

1130
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,048
WHAT IF HE SAVES HER?

1131
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,342
>> WE DON'T THINK HE HAS IT YET.

1132
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,052
>> WE JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

1133
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,261
OUR MARK FOR RACHEL IS GOING TO

1134
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,180
BE CIERA.

1135
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,307
>> IT'S GONNA BE RACHEL.

1136
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:01,516
OKAY?

1137
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,185
>> OKAY.

1138
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,772
>> WE'RE GONNA-- WE'RE PROBABLY

1139
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,440
GONNA TELL RACHEL THAT IT'S YOU,

1140
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:09,649
OKAY?

1141
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,359
>> I AM FREAKED OUT.

1142
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,861
JOHN TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GOING

1143
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,988
TO TELL RACHEL TO VOTE ME, AND

1144
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,073
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE

1145
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,324
WE'RE ALL VOTING RACHEL.

1146
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,662
WELL, THAT'S TOO SKETCHY FOR ME.

1147
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,287
>> THEY TOLD ME ALL THE GUYS ARE

1148
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,748
ON THE SAME PAGE WITH VOTING

1149
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,290
RACHEL OUT.

1150
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,792
>> HERE'S MY CONCERN.

1151
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,209
WE ALL VOTE RACHEL.

1152
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,879
IF HE HAS THE IDOL AND HE-- JOHN

1153
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,714
TOLD ME THEY'RE GOING TO TELL

1154
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,049
RACHEL TO VOTE ME.

1155
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,968
SO SHE'LL WRITE MY NAME DOWN.

1156
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,262
WE ALL VOTE RACHEL.

1157
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,347
HE SAVES RACHEL I GO HOME.

1158
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,183
>> THAT IS THE EXACT CERTAIN.

1159
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:48,563
I SAID WHY DON'T ME AND CIERA

1160
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,564
VOTE SOMEONE ELSE, JOHN.

1161
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,690
>> AM I IN TROUBLE.

1162
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,400
>> NO, IT'S CIERA.

1163
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,944
>> THIS IS NOT THE VOTE THEY

1164
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:55,736
REALLY WANT TO MAKE.

1165
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,405
I DIDN'T WANT RACHEL TO GO AND

1166
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,281
I'M DISAGREEING WITH THE OTHER

1167
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,407
GUYS IN MY ALLIANCE ABOUT THAT.

1168
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,492
I DON'T WANT MY ALLIANCE NOT TO

1169
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,494
TRUST ME BECAUSE I WANT VERY

1170
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,746
PUBLICLY GIVEN A CLUE TO THE

1171
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,664
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1172
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,165
I HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET BUT I

1173
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,876
DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THEM

1174
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,127
HAVING FEELINGS OF DOUBT WHEN IT

1175
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,840
COMES TO MY FAITH IN THE

1176
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,591
ALLIANCE.

1177
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,301
>> FEDERALLY IF I SAW ALL THIS

1178
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,720
CRAP IN MY RICE I WOULD NOT PAY

1179
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,972
THE BILL AND GO HOME.

1180
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,265
OH, THERE'S COCONUT HERE AND

1181
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:24,432
SAND.

1182
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:29,979
>> IT'S GOOD.

1183
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,234
>> WHERE IS JOHN GOING?

1184
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,862
>> JOHN'S KIND OF HIDING THE

1185
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,655
IDOL CREW, NOT REALLY FIG

1186
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,823
EVERYBODY IN.

1187
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,491
WE ALL KNOW HE'S LOOKING FOR IT.

1188
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,620
IT MAKES YOU A LITTLE WEARY.

1189
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,205
RIGHT NOW, JOHN IS WITH THE FIVE

1190
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:48,414
GUYS.

1191
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,874
WE'LL SEE HOW LONG HE STAYS THAT

1192
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,250
WAY.

1193
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,877
>> THIS IS GREAT.

1194
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,587
AS SOON AS I MENTION RACHEL,

1195
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,588
IT'S LIKE NO.

1196
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,424
NOW, HE'S GOT A CLUE TO THE

1197
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:58,799
IDOL.

1198
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,467
>> I WONDER IF HE'S-- IF HE'S

1199
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,846
GOING TO SHARE IT OR IF HE'S--

1200
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,264
>> YOING YOENG HE'LL SHARE IT.

1201
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,182
>> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

1202
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,934
>> HE'S NOT SHARING.

1203
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,727
>> ONE THING, MAYBE, TWO THINGS

1204
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,811
MAYBE MORE.

1205
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,605
FOR EVERYTHING TO ADD UP, IT'S

1206
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,648
LIKE I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE

1207
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,566
THAT SAYS BREAK UP THE FIVE GUYS

1208
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:15,775
FIRST.

1209
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,861
BUT TO BE HONEST, WE SHOULD VOTE

1210
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,070
JOHN.

1211
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:19,695
BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE FOUND THE

1212
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,406
IDOL, JUST HIS ENERGY AND HIS

1213
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,532
RESOURCEFULNESS I TOTALLY THINK

1214
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,825
HE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE THE THE

1215
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,369
IDOL, AND IF SOMEBODY STARTS TO

1216
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,120
SHOW SIGNS THEY'RE WILLING TO DO

1217
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,163
THEIR OWN THING AND GO AGAINST

1218
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:31,332
THE GROUP, GET HIM OUT NOW.

1219
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:48,057
BLINDSIDE HIM NOW.

1220
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,488
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK A LITTLE

1221
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,198
BIT ABOUT THE MEN VERSUS WOMEN

1222
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:04,365
RATIO.

1223
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,950
OUT OF THE GATE YOU VOTE OUT

1224
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:06,158
LAURA.

1225
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:06,701
THEN YOU VOTE OUT MARISSA.

1226
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,369
SO NOW IT'S FIVE GUYS, THREE

1227
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,412
WOMEN.

1228
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,663
ARE THE WOMEN TALKING ABOUT

1229
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:10,871
THIS?

1230
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,957
>> I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE WHEN

1231
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,208
YOU'RE SEEING ALL OF THE MEN GO

1232
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,501
OFF INTO THE BOAT, AND THERE ARE

1233
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,419
THREE WOMEN SITTING, THERE'S A

1234
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,545
SENSE THAT WE'RE ALL VULNERABLE

1235
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,337
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WE ARE

1236
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,715
DOWN IN THE NUMBERS.

1237
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,133
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, YOU'RE

1238
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:22,383
SMILING.

1239
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:22,883
ARE YOU RELATING TO THIS?

1240
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,343
>> LIKE, I UNDERSTAND WHERE

1241
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,344
THEY'RE COMING FROM WHEN THEY

1242
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,595
SAY, THIS BUT THE GUYS HAVE

1243
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,306
BONDED TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT'S

1244
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,600
JUST KIND OF HOW IT WRKD OUT SO

1245
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:31,767
FAR.

1246
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,102
NOT TO SAY THERE'S NOT ANYTHING

1247
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,603
GOING ON, OR WHATNOT.

1248
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,439
>> Jeff: KATIE, HAYDEN JUST

1249
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,859
WAS CLEAR TO POINT OUT SAYING

1250
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,986
I'M NOT SAYING THERE IS NOT

1251
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:42,570
SOMETHING GOING ON.

1252
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,280
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU DO?

1253
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,906
>> WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

1254
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,073
OUT.

1255
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,367
>> Jeff: JOHN, CANDICE IS THE

1256
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,201
AT REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1257
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:49,410
>> YES.

1258
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,369
>> Jeff: SHE GIVES THE CLUE TO

1259
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:50,745
THE IDOL TO YOU.

1260
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,746
>> OF COURSE.

1261
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,914
>> Jeff: CALEB, WOULD IT BE

1262
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,582
FAIR TO ASSUME IF YOU'RE JOHN

1263
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,209
THAT YOU NOW HAVE AT LEAST A

1264
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:57,752
LITTLE "X" ON THE SHOULDER?

1265
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,461
>> BASED ON THE HISTORY OF

1266
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:02,256
"SURVIVOR" THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1267
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:02,631
IDOL IS A TARGET.

1268
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,383
>> ANOTHER THING, JEFF, THERE'S

1269
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,426
PROBABLY AN ASSUMPTION HE HAS

1270
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,260
ALREADY FOUND IT.

1271
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,470
HE HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER

1272
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,637
IT'S BEST TO TELL THE WHOLE

1273
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:08,971
TRIBE OR NOT.

1274
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,473
>> Jeff: SO, JOHN, WITH

1275
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,475
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON,

1276
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,976
WHOEVER THIS TRIBE VOTES OUT

1277
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,603
WILL TRY TO TAKE YOUR WIFE OUT.

1278
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,437
>> YEAH, ANDOP OF THAT, WHOEVER

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,481
WE VOTE OUT TONIGHT, THEIR LOVED

1280
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,691
ONE COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE THEIR

00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,319
PLACE, AND THEN TRY AND BEAT

1282
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:23,569
CANDICE.

1283
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,237
>> Jeff: SO, HAYDEN, YOU VOTE

1284
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,655
SOMEBODY OUT, THEY GO TO

00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,948
REDEMPTION, THEIR LOVED ONE

TAKES THEIR SPOT.

1287
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,450
>> IT'S TWISTED, JEFF.

1288
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,618
I MEAN, IT IS.

1289
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,410
POTENTIALLY, WE COULD WEAKEN

1290
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,412
THEIR TRIBE.

1291
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,955
BY VOTING SOMEBODY OUT HERE

1292
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,416

>> Jeff: THERE ARE PROBABLY

1294
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:39,960
MORE LAYERS TO VOTES THIS SEASON

1295
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,463

1296
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,632
AND IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1297
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:51,180
RACHEL, YOU'RE UP.

I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1299
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,596
ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY TNOW

1301
