1
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:04,166
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,049
Approaching the board,

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,566
Kellyn saw an opportunity 
to strike.

4
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:11,987
This is our chance to take out Wendell.

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,642
But Wendell and Domenick 
had their own goal...

6
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,492
We take out Chelsea and then... 
It's piece of cake.

7
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,542
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,667
...leaving Donathan and Laurel 
in the middle.

9
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:21,886
What do you want to do?

10
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:24,375
Donathan and I 
both control this board

11
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,615
and the direction of the rest of the game.

12
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:29,204
At the council,

13
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:30,862
Donathan and Laurel

14
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:33,245
stayed with Domenick and Wendell...

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,136
Chelsea, the tribe has spoken.

16
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:39,867
...leaving Kellyn without allies.

17
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,569
There are seven left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

18
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,041
A rough evening for me.

19
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,234
A very close ally is gone

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,666
and my new alliance 
clearly didn't work.

21
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:05,344
Finding myself at the bottom of the ladder,

22
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,346
I am open to discussion

23
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:09,978
and I wait 
to see who will approach me.

24
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:12,642
I'm next 
I don't believe.

25
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,367
That's why 
I had to target Wendell.

26
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,821
When I see that going out next 
is the goal of the two bosses,

27
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,657
it's very hard to get around that.

28
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:27,142
But after my divorce, I was 
n't sure where I wanted to go,

29
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,953
but I had the idea that maybe,

30
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,242
if I followed my gut, 
things would turn out well.

31
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,690
That's the impression 
I have now.

32
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:38,273
So we'll see what I can 
stir up tomorrow.

33
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:52,213
Any ideas this morning? 
As for what's next?

34
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,041
No. I do not know.

35
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,811
On the one hand, I say to myself...

36
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,742
...that there's a game to be played 
against the guys,

37
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:03,025
if we worked with Ang and Kellyn 
for a vote.

38
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,595
But on the other hand, 
I don't trust them.

39
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,151
If we keep 
playing it too safe,

40
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:10,841
we will be even worse off 
at the end...

41
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:11,841
I say.

42
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,341
...with no chance 
of winning immunities.

43
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,420
I say. 
This is probably the last chance

44
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:19,154
to release one 
without them playing an idol.

45
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,184
Dom and Wendell 
believe us 100% with them,

46
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:26,441
because last night I could have 
attacked Wendell and didn't.

47
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:29,341
But I know I 
can't beat them in the final.

48
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:32,142
And at seven, it's kind 
of the last chance

49
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,910
to take out some of the guys, 
blow up the idols

50
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:37,106
and position myself for the end.

51
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,441
If we act, 
we need to target one of the forts.

52
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:44,042
That's... That would be my plan.

53
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,239
They are 
two of my best friends here.

54
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:49,444
Dom and Wendell protected me.

55
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:52,441
They could have fired me 
a long time ago and didn't.

56
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:54,043
So it's risky.

57
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:57,623
We have an opportunity 
to take control.

58
00:02:57,748 --> 00:03:01,042
To give it a try. 
I would be sorry not to try.

59
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,705
Laurel and I have been together 
since the beginning

60
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,392
and it hasn't changed.

61
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:08,242
We had chances 
to take out Wendell and Dom,

62
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:11,666
but Laurel always changes her mind, 
it's frustrating.

63
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:15,441
These guys dominated the whole game. 
It's hard to watch.

64
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:18,841
So I would love 
to take control of the game.

65
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,799
Well, I've reached the middle...

66
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:24,042
But that won't get me through.

67
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,351
And if Laurel keeps 
changing her mind all the time,

68
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:29,841
I may have to 
take matters into my own hands.

69
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,966
I am ready to take up the challenge.

70
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:37,359
So you and Laurel were 
thinking of a plan

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,042
to fire these boys.

72
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,866
If we can be the four

73
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:43,466
and that they are only three,

74
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,940
we would have a better chance 
of succeeding.

75
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:48,770
Donathan approaches me with an idea:

76
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:52,683
that he, Ang, 
Laurel and I vote together

77
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,441
to take Wendell out by surprise.

78
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:58,841
You don't have to let anything slip, 
if you want it to work.

79
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,742
No, I know, it's either... 
I know, I know.

80
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:06,441
Tried to rally troops 
to take action against Wendell before

81
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:09,031
and Laurel and Donathan screwed up

82
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:11,642
which seemed like 
the best shot to me.

83
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:15,267
Nevertheless, that Donathan 
wants to work with me delights me.

84
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:18,967
I'm telling you, 
we're holding out an olive branch to you.

85
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,941
I felt 
like I was underrated from the start

86
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:25,141
because Wendell and Domenick 
were the dominant

87
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,542
and that they always 
decided for me.

88
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,433
But I don't want to 
let that happen anymore.

89
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,398
Over here, everyone!

90
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,346
What the fuck is that?!

91
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:55,363
...And then there were seven!

92
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,953
Ready for 
today's reward event?

93
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,624
Today you will be separated 
into three teams of two.

94
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:07,742
On my signal, you will drop 
a wooden spool onto a track.

95
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,441
It will roll down.

96
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:13,042
You'll grab it there, pull it up, 
and put it back on the trail.

97
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,257
Regularly, 
you will add reels,

98
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:18,007
increasing the difficulty.

99
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,165
If a reel falls,

100
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,496
it's lost.

101
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,284
The last duo in play 
wins the reward.

102
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:26,081
Want to know what's at stake?

103
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,949
The winners will serve

104
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:30,819
Survivor Goodwill Ambassadors .

105
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:35,542
They will deliver 
much needed materials to a local school,

106
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,242
making students and teachers very happy .

107
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,896
Then you'll celebrate 
with roast chicken...

108
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,271
Lord! 
...and chocolate cake.

109
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,742
We will do so.

110
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:47,042
We will 
draw lots for captains,

111
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,141
who will choose their partners.

112
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,460
So a person 
will not be chosen,

113
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:56,342
who will not be able to go to the 
reward, nor to the Ghost Island.

114
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:57,542
Big stakes.

115
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,950
We draw the captains 
and we start.

116
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:09,266
We have our three duos.

117
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,542
Kellyn was captain, 
she chose Sebastian.

118
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,443
Wendell was captain, 
he picked Domenick.

119
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:18,119
Donathan was captain, 
he chose Laurel.

120
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:19,941
Angela was not chosen.

121
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:23,167
No chance to go to the reward 
or Ghost Island.

122
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:25,566
Let's go. 
Survivors, ready?

123
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:31,367
We start with two.

124
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:37,266
Drop the first, and before it 
gets to the bottom, drop the second.

125
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,641
Right off the bat, it's 
all about spacing.

126
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,369
Tell me when. 
Go ahead!

127
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,766
Sebastian drops his second.

128
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,120
Donathan drops his.

129
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:52,066
Domenick drops his second. 
Let's go.

130
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,511
Perfect, Kelly.

131
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:55,949
Great!

132
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:58,242
If the reel drops, it's lost.

133
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,242
So if you drop her going 
up the stairs,

134
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,667
or if the reels touch, 
it is lost.

135
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,555
Take your time.

136
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:08,742
And... Coward!

137
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,539
We are two reels.

138
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,338
It gives you time 
to take the hit.

139
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:16,224
After 33 days,

140
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:19,542
those simple stairs will wear you out.

141
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:20,758
It arrives quickly!

142
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:22,633
And that's just the beginning.

143
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:24,058
Go on!

144
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:28,294
You now have 15 seconds 
to release a third reel.

145
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,190
Quick!

146
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:32,167
The person on top 
can drop the news.

147
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,766
Wendell lets go.

148
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,422
Sebastian lets go.

149
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:36,867
Laurel lets go.

150
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:40,042
All now have three coils.

151
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,542
We have to speed up.

152
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,620
You have to run faster 
and space out better.

153
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:49,167
Try to give 
your partner time to get off

154
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,242
before coming back up to release it!

155
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,720
Come on, Laurel! 
Always moving!

156
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,441
It's a big reward 
after 33 days of adventure.

157
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,359
If you want it, 
you have to earn it, now!

158
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,467
Hurry, she's coming.

159
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:04,526
Course!

160
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,053
I let her go, huh?

161
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:11,955
This test is not easy.

162
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,778
You go-y!

163
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:15,378
We go up and down these stairs.

164
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,570
Let her go!

165
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:18,873
Its good!

166
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,619
I can hear your breaths from here.

167
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:26,211
Fatigue 
is really starting to set in.

168
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,935
You now have 15 seconds

169
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,066
to add a fourth coil.

170
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,423
Communication is essential.

171
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:37,937
Strive to space out those coils

172
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:40,261
as much as you can!

173
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:41,271
You do it?

174
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:42,297
Five...

175
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:43,459
...four...

176
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:44,501
...three...

177
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:45,641
...of them...

178
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:48,342
Let's all drop the fourth reel!

179
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,975
The race is gaining in intensity!

180
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,389
Dark! 
Come on!

181
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:54,205
Quick!

182
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,744
The better you space out, the more time you have 
on the stairs.

183
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:01,266
Kellyn, these two 
are too close!

184
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:04,367
If you lose the rhythm, 
you have to go for it to get back!

185
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,209
It goes down fast, Laurel!

186
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,992
One mistake and it's over, 
no reward!

187
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,525
Don, you go-y!

188
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:13,551
Donathan is going to have to hurry. 
Quick!

189
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:15,067
He has it!

190
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:17,067
There is no respite.

191
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,733
It's consistent.

192
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:20,954
This is coming fast!

193
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,528
It was right!

194
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:26,845
Everyone go for it, 
everyone wants this reward.

195
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:29,666
It arrives quickly!

196
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,641
Only 15 seconds left 
in this round.

197
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,783
Then we will add a fifth

198
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:38,651
and last reel, 
and will continue until the end.

199
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,931
Come on, Laurel! 
Come on, Don!

200
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:45,067
It's time to drop 
a fifth reel.

201
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,342
Stay up there!

202
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,346
Five...

203
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:49,978
...four...

204
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,323
...three...

205
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:52,500
...of them...

206
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,476
...and...

207
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:55,367
Come down immediately!

208
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,205
Go on!

209
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:58,786
Don! 
We have to replace them!

210
00:09:58,923 --> 00:10:00,220
Everyone talks!

211
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:02,421
I let go when you catch. 
Run, Dom!

212
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:05,590
Here we are, that's where it all happens!

213
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:09,117
Kellyn, they're too close! 
So go for it!

214
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:14,641
Sebastian fails!

215
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,689
Sebastian and Kellyn are eliminated! 
Only two duets left!

216
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:18,899
Course! Course!

217
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,195
Come on, Laurel!

218
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,403
Laurel can't! 
This test is over!

219
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:32,640
Domenick and Wendell 
win the reward!

220
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,777
It's difficult.

221
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:37,567
Lord!

222
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:42,918
Domenick, Wendell, come here!

223
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:46,020
Big win, big reward,

224
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,442
big decision.

225
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,917
You will be 
Survivor's ambassadors,

226
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:53,742
bringing much-needed supplies to a local school,

227
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:57,041
a lovely afternoon with fried chicken 
and chocolate cake.

228
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,967
Choose a person 
to accompany you.

229
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,567
The others, if you want to 
plead your case, now is the time.

230
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:04,865
No, we chose.

231
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,172
Yes? 
Yes.

232
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:07,742
So? 
Laurel.

233
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,467
Laurel, come here.

234
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,187
Now the other big decision.

235
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,319
Who goes to Ghost Island?

236
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,067
You two decide.

237
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:26,404
You have to agree, 
otherwise they shoot the stones.

238
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,942
Easy. 
Wow, it's simple!

239
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,641
So? 
The pirate.

240
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,865
Sebastian goes to Ghost Island.

241
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,006
You applaud. Excited?

242
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,842
I love being called "pirate"!

243
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:42,041
Take your things, 
the boat is waiting for you.

244
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,271
Take care of yourself!

245
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,742
Good. Wendell, Domenick, Laurel: 
great afternoon,

246
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:48,942
be good ambassadors. 
On the way!

247
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,708
Enjoy. 
Thanks.

248
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,041
Kellyn, Donathan, Angela: 
nothing for you.

249
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,842
Take your things, leave.

250
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:57,283
When Wendell and Domenick 
chose Laurel,

251
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:58,641
I was pissed.

252
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:00,122
It becomes their game

253
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:03,467
and I no longer see myself 
in this quartet.

254
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:06,041
It's time to rally people

255
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,244
and go after the big guys.

256
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:12,116
I want to prove to Domenick and Wendell 
not to come looking for me.

257
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,538
Wendell and Domenick 
sent me to Ghost Island

258
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:35,310
because they think 
that I am their remora.

259
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:37,209
It's a sucker fish,

260
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:40,510
and one of the most abundant 
in the ocean.

261
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:44,734
And they attach themselves 
to the belly of these monsters,

262
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,709
great whites, mako sharks.

263
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,010
But this game is almost over.

264
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,412
And Ghost Island, so late in the game, 
is decisive.

265
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,510
The benefits seem to 
be ever more powerful.

266
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:59,413
So the remora might 
just turn into a shark.

267
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,820
"Break the urn."

268
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:11,072
"Let the game begin! 
Follow the fire."

269
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:20,280
“The odds have increased.

270
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:22,896
Three hold power.

271
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:25,346
Risk your vote to play."

272
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,035
There are four...

273
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:29,637
Three out of four 
is a hell of a chance.

274
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,310
And that's Survivor. 
You have to try everything.

275
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:33,612
I will play.

276
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:37,281
I choose this one.

277
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:38,535
Go on!

278
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,435
A key. It seems positive.

279
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:57,135
“Congratulations! 
You have gained an advantage.

280
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:00,003
This is a genuine 
"vote theft"..."

281
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,135
Owl!

282
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:05,310
"...which causes the elimination 
of Michaela in season 34

283
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:08,163
and was poorly played by Kellyn 
in this season.

284
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,469
He no longer has the power 
to steal a vote,

285
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:15,510
but can be used 
as an additional secret ballot."

286
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:16,964
Damn, yeah!

287
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:20,310
"But, agonizing question: 
is this vote cursed forever

288
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:23,006
or will you finally reverse 
the curse?"

289
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:27,035
Nothing could have happened to me better.

290
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:30,681
This is the authentic "vote theft" 
of Game Changers.

291
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:34,748
Kellyn received it, this season, 
as an extra vote

292
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:36,410
but misused it.

293
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:39,526
Now it is transmitted to me.

294
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:43,635
And having two votes 
is great.

295
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,693
It's a chance 
to show everyone here

296
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,135
that I can play Survivor 
and win the game.

297
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:12,734
For the reward, Laurel, 
Wendell and I were in a boat

298
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:16,462
loaded with school 
and sports equipment as well as toys.

299
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:18,634
Balloons! Go on!

300
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:20,562
Their simple faces

301
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,397
reminded us 
that it doesn't matter where we are.

302
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:27,890
I live in New York, 
16 hours by plane from here.

303
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,910
My name is Domenick.

304
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,986
And to see that my kids, 
when I give them a present,

305
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:38,958
react exactly like 
those on the other side of the world...

306
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,858
It's just universal happiness.

307
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,015
I have two!

308
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,627
We all caught kids

309
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,046
Laurel played volleyball 
with some,

310
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,884
Wendell you basket...

311
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,442
Everyone brought 
their own particular scent.

312
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:54,086
We couldn't have had a 
better trio for this award.

313
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,500
The people of Vanuya 
welcome you.

314
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,954
Thanks! 
Let's go!

315
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,139
Dom and I 
have been collaborating since the beginning.

316
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:02,341
Most...

317
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:05,972
At times, Laurel still seems to 
have a lot of doubts.

318
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:08,862
So we chose her 
to accompany us

319
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:11,341
to show our alliance,

320
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:14,698
to reward her for her loyalty...

321
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:16,052
God's goodness!

322
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:18,675
...to show her 
how much we care about her

323
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:20,948
and offer him this special moment.

324
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:23,210
That's the team. You see?

325
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,126
One, two, three, we're going all the way.

326
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,993
Who will win, in your opinion?

327
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:30,794
Who?

328
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:32,568
She's looking at me!

329
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:35,001
We've come a long way together.

330
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:37,304
We bonded on the 9th or 10th day

331
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:39,579
and we've been loyal to each other ever since.

332
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:42,791
My best hope is that in the final, 
you split the votes.

333
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,177
So. 
Clearly my best hope.

334
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:46,453
This is my argument.

335
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:48,942
"I am with you!

336
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,006
Going to the final with you makes sense.

337
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:54,613
You'll split the votes 
and I'll get the rest."

338
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:57,524
And I think 
they're counting on it, but...

339
00:16:57,873 --> 00:16:59,528
I'm here to knock them out.

340
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,578
Top three, friends!

341
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:02,623
Three...

342
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,924
I love them, but the game first.

343
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:27,568
You understand that... We are solid.

344
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:29,851
100 %.

345
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,934
After Domenick, Wendell and Laurel 
went to the reward,

346
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,369
I see what will undoubtedly be 
the demarcations for me.

347
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:41,535
So my only option is to 
destabilize them a bit.

348
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,795
Dom will be tough to beat in the end.

349
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:48,691
If you're both in the final, 
I'm voting for him, not you.

350
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,644
Thank you, Donathan.

351
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:53,922
I'm trying to save you, so...

352
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:56,730
Since I think I'll end up on the jury anyway ...

353
00:17:56,855 --> 00:17:57,622
Wow!

354
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,920
Strong statement, my friend.

355
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,487
Dom already knows 
that I will vote for him.

356
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:06,391
Then I guess that'll inspire 
him to put you on the jury.

357
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:09,679
I don't know what you're doing here.

358
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,505
I think my truth bombs 
are paying off.

359
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,653
I hope I terrified Wendell.

360
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,267
It's my goal, 
that they are afraid of each other.

361
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:19,789
It's good for me.

362
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:22,253
It's time 
to pit them against each other.

363
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:23,891
What are you doing beautiful?

364
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,151
Routine.

365
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:26,608
Useful info?

366
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,276
He says you have his vote

367
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,460
and that it will encourage you 
to send him to the jury.

368
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,975
Can I ask you a question?

369
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,861
If you've completely given up 
on the final trio,

370
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:40,618
so what motivates you 
to continue with us, as a quartet?

371
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:42,133
That is what I am saying.

372
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:44,698
No more motivation, then.

373
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:47,160
I don't know what my place is 
in the game.

374
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,453
Good then.

375
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,079
I thought we worked together.

376
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:55,375
Donathan told us bluntly:

377
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,399
"I can't beat 
either of you, so..."

378
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:01,047
Looks like he fired a suicide bomber.

379
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:03,691
And I know he's ready 
for a big hit.

380
00:19:03,816 --> 00:19:06,822
I know it's coming, 
I can feel it.

381
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:09,392
He went from being a "good low-key guy,

382
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:12,112
I support you and hope 
your story is good"...

383
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:13,936
...to "yo brother".

384
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,002
...To "I'm going to cut your throat 
with a credit card".

385
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,761
I don't know what he will do.

386
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:23,103
He's going to ruin his game, mine, 
everyone's game.

387
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:27,047
He scares me. He is 
blowing up the game.

388
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:50,086
Over here, everyone!

389
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:04,764
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

390
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:07,242
First of all, Domenick, 
I'll take it back.

391
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:15,579
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

392
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:19,154
Today, you will collect 
two piles of planks.

393
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,609
With it, you will build a bridge...

394
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,925
...which you will cross, 
arriving at a tower.

395
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:29,491
There you will build a ladder 
and climb it.

396
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:32,415
Once at the top,

397
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:35,585
you will solve 
a Survivor sliding puzzle.

398
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,926
The first to finish wins immunity,

399
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:42,648
ensures a one in six chance 
of reaching the final.

400
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:46,592
At the council, 
someone will become the seventh juror.

401
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:50,393
Survivor is full of make 
or break moments.

402
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,787
For one of you, that moment is here.

403
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:56,082
Who? 
And can you rise to the challenge?

404
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:58,331
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

405
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:05,672
Alright, here we go. 
For immunity.

406
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,272
Survivors, ready?

407
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:15,140
Donathan.

408
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:18,372
Full of energy, 
he rushes towards the boards.

409
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,490
With, you have to assemble a bridge.

410
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:26,730
You have to lay one plank at a time, 
in order.

411
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:29,527
Wendell attempts a first play.

412
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:31,922
It's the right one.

413
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,846
Laurel attempts a coin. Not the good one.

414
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:36,513
Sebastian's turn.

415
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:37,836
Not the good one.

416
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:41,130
First piece for Kellyn.

417
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:44,806
Sebastian has one now.

418
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:48,708
And one for Domenick.

419
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,491
And two for Wendell.

420
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:54,490
Everyone is exhausted. 35 days...

421
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:56,021
And now this!

422
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:58,380
Donathan is wrong again.

423
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:01,162
Angela and Donathan 
are dead last.

424
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:06,072
Big fall for Kellyn!

425
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:11,258
We have Wendell and Sebastian, 
side by side.

426
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,739
Sebastian cheated.

427
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,588
Both take turns leading.

428
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:18,344
New piece for Wendell.

429
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,859
New room for Sebastian.

430
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:24,826
New room for Laurel.

431
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:27,219
New room for Domenick.

432
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:30,124
We are starting 
to move up a gear.

433
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,055
Last piece for Wendell, 
it's good! He can chain.

434
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,674
And he leads.

435
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,856
Sebastian is finished, he can go.

436
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:48,085
Wendell and Sebastian 
have a huge lead.

437
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,403
Wendell places 
his first rung on the ladder.

438
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:55,685
You have to build from the bottom up. 
Each piece must fit together.

439
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:01,149
It's good for Domenick and Laurel.

440
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,281
Laurel and Dom attempt to return.

441
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,312
Wendell has two bars 
and is looking for the third.

442
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,032
I have three, Jeff! 
And he has it!

443
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,358
First rung for Sebastian.

444
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:21,888
Wendell sets up another, 
only three short.

445
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:26,373
This is Kellyn. 
She can attack her ladder.

446
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:32,349
Wendell can climb to the top.

447
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:35,413
He moves on to the third 
and final section.

448
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:37,404
Unbelievable!

449
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,132
Angela and Donathan...

450
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:42,725
This bridge doesn't have that 
many pieces!

451
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:46,657
They try again and again 
the same parts without finding!

452
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,998
Sebastian is done, he can go up.

453
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:53,854
Start at the top, Sea Wolf!

454
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:56,497
Wendell and Sebastian 
are on the sliding puzzle.

455
00:23:56,622 --> 00:23:58,655
Laurel tries to join them.

456
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:02,952
Donathan...

457
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:04,930
...finally finished the bridge!

458
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,219
It can go ladder.

459
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:10,610
Remain Angela, 
all alone, dead last.

460
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:15,836
Laurel finishes her ladder, 
she can climb.

461
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:20,149
She'll be happy to see 
it's the same sliding puzzle

462
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:22,961
than that of the very first 
moments of the first day.

463
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,131
She hadn't finished it, 
but she was able to try.

464
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,704
Will she remember 
anything useful?

465
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:33,437
Dom completed his ladder.

466
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:42,456
It quickly moves pieces.

467
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,424
Wendell progresses 
to the top of the puzzle.

468
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:49,117
Sebastian slows down.

469
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:52,702
This is the 
35 day effect of Survivor.

470
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:55,559
An otherwise rather simple puzzle

471
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:59,393
becomes literally 
impossible to finish for some.

472
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,404
Dom moves more pieces.

473
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:04,321
It is launched.

474
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:07,493
Wendell quietly continues 
his work

475
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:09,028
and made progress.

476
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,602
Laurel is doing well.

477
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:15,854
Donathan is coming, he's still fighting!

478
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,912
Kelly's Termine son échelle.

479
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:24,265
Angela 
is still working on her bridge.

480
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,113
She's out of it.

481
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,478
Laurel, very methodical, 
quietly moves pieces.

482
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,552
Dom, much more frenetic.

483
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:34,306
Wendell, dans sa bulle.

484
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:37,532
Wendell 
still has the cards in hand.

485
00:25:37,657 --> 00:25:39,668
He's been leading from the start.

486
00:25:39,793 --> 00:25:42,118
He seems to have forgotten the others.

487
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:45,279
Who will finish first 
and win immunity?

488
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:52,429
Jeff! 
Laurel thinks she has it.

489
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,218
Laurel wins 
individual immunity!

490
00:25:57,635 --> 00:26:01,810
Safe at tonight's council, 
she can't be eliminated.

491
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:04,602
I should have called your name, 
I guess.

492
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:10,296
Did you call me? 
No.

493
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,051
You must call.

494
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:13,936
You understand, right?

495
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:16,305
It's only over 
when you say so.

496
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,966
I finished and did...

497
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:19,408
And I didn't say anything.

498
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:21,576
I could have called earlier too.

499
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:23,842
I heard Laurel calling but...

500
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:26,855
I clearly had it before, 
but you called first.

501
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,547
So you won.

502
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,281
So you agree 
that if you don't call,

503
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,680
I don't know if you still have 
any doubts.

504
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:34,801
I agree.

505
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,322
So that suits you.

506
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:39,651
Well, it's maintained. 
Laurel wins immunity.

507
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:41,425
This is how. 
I appreciate.

508
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,180
Cheer. Sorry. 
Well done, Laurel.

509
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,582
Laurel, come here!

510
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:54,681
Immunity is yours, 
you cannot be eliminated tonight.

511
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:56,065
As for you others,

512
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,441
Angela, Kellyn, Domenick, 
Donathan, Sebastian, Wendell,

513
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:02,566
after 35 days, 
someone is going to leave tonight.

514
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:04,739
Take your things. 
See you tonight at the council.

515
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:06,036
Cheer. 
Thanks.

516
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:09,110
It's hard to lose, 
I needed to win.

517
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:12,123
But Donathan approached me 
to take out Wendell.

518
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:14,968
So I want to see words 
translated into actions,

519
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,364
and I want it to happen tonight.

520
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,460
Laurel! You did it!

521
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:34,257
I've been considering taking Wendell out 
tonight.

522
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,308
But I want to do it right.

523
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,700
He finished first today, 
he could have won immunity.

524
00:27:39,988 --> 00:27:42,504
It seems almost unfair 
to eliminate it.

525
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,800
I don't like 
the way it happened.

526
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:46,718
Yeah. Not serious.

527
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:49,451
I may win one 
in the future.

528
00:27:50,194 --> 00:27:51,686
If I'm still here.

529
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:54,777
I think the good move 
is to stay with my allies

530
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:56,264
et de sortir Kellyn.

531
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:59,427
Tonight, I prefer 
the good shot to the big shot.

532
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:02,997
It's tricky now.

533
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:04,040
Donathan...

534
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:06,346
We should 
take out Kellyn first, right?

535
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:09,961
Yes, but... He's going to talk to her.

536
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:10,901
Yeah.

537
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:12,840
But we still have to 
get Kellyn out.

538
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,654
Kellyn is super dangerous.

539
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:18,121
For trials as for the end, 
where no one wants to take him.

540
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:20,949
She is super popular 
and has lots of friends on the jury.

541
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,251
I think I know 
the obvious answer, but...

542
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,001
Always Kellyn, for me.

543
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:27,607
Is that the obvious? 
Yes.

544
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:31,023
The consensus is 
that we'll do our best to get Kellyn out.

545
00:28:31,148 --> 00:28:33,135
What is your suggestion?

546
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,952
We discussed ours, 
we want to hear yours.

547
00:28:36,077 --> 00:28:37,771
which one are yours?

548
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:40,652
For me, 
you have to get Kellyn out. This is...

549
00:28:40,912 --> 00:28:44,041
But if you're going to take me out 
by surprise, let me know!

550
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:49,678
I'm nervous, I can't help it.

551
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,558
Without warning,

552
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:54,267
Donathan decides to freak out.

553
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:57,422
It seems 
that as the end of the game approaches,

554
00:28:58,022 --> 00:28:59,724
it implodes.

555
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:01,323
It baffles me.

556
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,819
Nobody's gonna take you out of the game. 
Good.

557
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:08,055
Kellyn is more dangerous 
because appreciated and all that,

558
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,021
but it is at least reasonable.

559
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:13,559
"If you're going to kill me..."

560
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:17,172
Laurel and I looked at each other, 
"What the fuck are you talking about?!"

561
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:20,504
We're afraid 
Donathan is trying something.

562
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,162
And suddenly,

563
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:25,411
I wish I could flex 
my muscles tonight at council.

564
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:27,028
I have a real idol,

565
00:29:27,153 --> 00:29:30,324
but moreover, i worked 
on a good fake idol.

566
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,120
I just miss the paper.

567
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:34,687
Do you have the packaging? 
So you want...

568
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,126
...the packaging and the message. 
Yeah.

569
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:40,297
I have to look, but I have this.

570
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:44,081
Now, if asked, 
I'm ready.

571
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,526
That, I keep!

572
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:07,157
So. Do whatever you want with it.

573
00:30:07,282 --> 00:30:08,609
What was that?

574
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,899
What? 
What?

575
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:15,845
I gave him something. 
OK.

576
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:18,554
Uh... Do you want...?

577
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:22,990
It has nothing to do 
with tonight, I promise.

578
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:26,107
Do you believe me?

579
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:28,547
Look in my bags, go ahead.

580
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:30,335
No it's OK. 
Will see.

581
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,539
I didn't know what was going on, 
that's all.

582
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,697
I was saving something for him. 
OK.

583
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,512
But if you have any doubts, go see!

584
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,157
You can 
search my two bags thoroughly.

585
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:44,810
It's okay, 
I'm not worried.

586
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:47,104
It's just... 
You asked.

587
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:48,394
It was weird.

588
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:51,766
Wendell et Domenick, en gros,

589
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,083
were doing shady things, 
near me, without my knowledge.

590
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:59,087
We're supposed to be super close, 
we have to share information.

591
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:00,949
It made me uncomfortable.

592
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:04,481
Seriously, if you're playing an idol 
on Kellyn tonight...

593
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:05,992
...I'm changing sides.

594
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:08,662
No one will protect Kellyn tonight.

595
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:11,071
She leaves, the plan has not changed.

596
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:14,086
I have to pull out all the stops 
now.

597
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:19,371
Basically, that's my only option.

598
00:31:19,496 --> 00:31:22,763
So I'm going to try to shake 
the coconut tree before the board.

599
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:24,802
Donathan est parti voir Kellyn.

600
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:28,165
How do you feel? 
Not very well.

601
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,564
Why? 
I'm afraid that tonight

602
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,339
they try to take me out.

603
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:36,596
I gave Wendell something 
in his bag.

604
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:39,881
Not an idol or anything, 
just the wrapping of a necklace.

605
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,982
"What was that?!"

606
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,567
Donathan?

607
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,528
Apparently, Wendell 
plans to play an idol tonight.

608
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:48,926
I saw Domenick 
bring him something.

609
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:51,468
He wants to intimidate people tonight.

610
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:54,996
Donathan 
is completely unpredictable, and...

611
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,541
He ends up doing 
what he wants.

612
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,773
Like throwing a pinned grenade 
to see who will catch it.

613
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:05,531
If Donathan wants to blow it all up,

614
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,772
maybe that's my ray of hope.

615
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:09,778
We can target Domenick.

616
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,796
We freaked him out.

617
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,318
He plotted for five minutes 
then ran off to get water.

618
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:18,070
We take it out?

619
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,480
Boom. We did it?

620
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,854
We don't know 
what he is capable of.

621
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,560
You never know, 
with such a volatile guy,

622
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:28,358
able to rush to talk 
to someone we are targeting,

623
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:29,978
what he could do.

624
00:32:30,103 --> 00:32:31,536
But there is also Kellyn.

625
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:34,725
A super strong competitor, 
a super threat,

626
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,537
and if we can blast 
another threat at seven,

627
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,198
our chances increase.

628
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:43,991
Every move, every decision has to 
be super strategic at this point.

629
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:47,849
That's what I try to do. 
The end is coming. The sprint begins.

630
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,706
Now here are the members of the jury.

631
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:23,455
and Chelsea, 
eliminated at the last council.

632
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,339
I would like to start

633
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:28,736
by talking about the test of the day,

634
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,905
compared to where we are 
in the game.

635
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,819
You are on the 35th day of the adventure.

636
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,699
And it will always be

637
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:39,643
one of the most intense, 
physically and emotionally exhausting,

638
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,753
experiences you will have.

639
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:45,398
What you feel is real. 
You are on the kneecaps.

640
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,910
It's hard. And we saw it 
in today's race.

641
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:50,541
Domenick, do you feel it?

642
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:54,317
Yes. I was completely shocked

643
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:56,454
by my mental abilities 
today.

644
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:59,858
I couldn't, 
I couldn't find it.

645
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:02,483
I can do a sliding puzzle 
in 40 seconds.

646
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:05,723
I couldn't find the first piece, 
the one in the upper left corner.

647
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:07,657
Surely we all agree

648
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:10,453
that blood, 
sweat and tears are left here

649
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:14,135
and you start to crumble, 
mentally and physically.

650
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:16,561
Wendell. To be honest, 
I don't remember

651
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,939
have already seen 
what happened today,

652
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:21,070
when you had that moment of...

653
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:24,197
"It's good, right? I think so." 
...And Laurel double crosses you.

654
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,954
Yes. 'Cause we've been here 
so long

655
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:30,311
the impact it had on us 
physically

656
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:33,830
also affected our mental game.

657
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:36,689
I am far from being as lively 
as on the first day.

658
00:34:36,814 --> 00:34:38,859
You really feel it. 
Absolutely.

659
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:41,598
It's good that I manage to smile about it,

660
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:44,065
but... everyone 
wants to wear this necklace.

661
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,083
I'm very proud of Laurel, 
but I'd rather have the necklace.

662
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:51,498
Domenick. What was the atmosphere 
on the camp?

663
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,626
Well... 
As the council approaches,

664
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:56,688
it's gone a bit of a spin.

665
00:34:56,813 --> 00:35:00,464
At one time, Wendell and I 
had this item of his,

666
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:04,001
I'll let him decide 
if he wants to talk about it,

667
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:07,082
but Donathan saw it. I think 
that freaked him out a bit.

668
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:10,990
And it may have made him 
rise in the towers.

669
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,893
Wendell. It's very enigmatic.

670
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,145
Domenick transferred something 
from his bag to mine.

671
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,143
"Oh! What's going on there?"

672
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:21,740
He puts something in my bag, 
big deal!

673
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:25,924
But it was just the three of us. If we 
're together, why the secrecy?

674
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:29,712
Why does 
everything everyone says or does

675
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,522
should be public?

676
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:34,923
Because you depend on me 
to get ahead in the game.

677
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:38,122
If you hide things from me, 
I become skeptical.

678
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,044
We're not hiding anything from you.

679
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:42,070
You were sorry 
for hiding your idol from me.

680
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:45,109
Because you absolutely want to 
know everything and repeat and...

681
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:49,372
From those I work with, I expect 
information, let's be clear.

682
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:51,898
Hence my frustration tonight.

683
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:55,399
Donathan. 
Can I say something?

684
00:36:02,105 --> 00:36:04,742
Kellyn. Your eyes are bulging!

685
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:08,837
I don't know what's going on, 
what people have in mind.

686
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:11,721
I just know that after 
the elimination of Chelsea, ...

687
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:13,884
...some were whispering... 
Same.

688
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:16,371
...that after Chelsea, it would be me.

689
00:36:16,496 --> 00:36:17,846
So... 
Jeff.

690
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:20,902
It probably won't be Kellyn 
tonight, but me.

691
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,449
You?! 
Mmh.

692
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,270
I see the whispers.

693
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:26,516
They have full pockets.

694
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:29,275
They could play one 
for Kellyn and get me out.

695
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,740
So I remain on my guard. 
We don't change anything.

696
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:33,959
We don't change anything.

697
00:36:34,783 --> 00:36:36,677
Ang, do you remember the hammock?

698
00:36:37,215 --> 00:36:39,180
Stay on the hammock plane.

699
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,449
I don't know what the hammock is.

700
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,653
' Cause we don't talk anymore, 
remember?

701
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:52,105
Laurel. This great sentence. 
"We're sticking to the plan."

702
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,345
If only you were sure you 
knew the plan!

703
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,034
Kellyn thinks it's her. 
Donathan is sure it's him.

704
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:02,990
Yes. I believe I arrived tonight 
with a solid plan A.

705
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:07,141
But I have a plan B and a plan C, 
because you always have to have them.

706
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:11,712
And when something like that happens, 
every word, every look has meaning.

707
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:16,261
And there, I try to be sure 
that what I am going to do suits me.

708
00:37:16,386 --> 00:37:18,519
And, Kellyn, 
if you think you're threatened,

709
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:23,010
that's what you want to hear, 
that there are disturbances.

710
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:26,846
Plans B and C? 
Great news for me!

711
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:29,350
Here there are outsiders

712
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:31,184
and dominants.

713
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:33,332
Dominants can, through fear,

714
00:37:33,457 --> 00:37:35,629
encourage others 
not to attack them.

715
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,168
Nevertheless, I was approached 
with plans today.

716
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:42,225
So, you never know, 
in Survivor.

717
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,719
Domenick. Is it a little disconcerting 
to say to yourself:

718
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:48,671
"Yes, of course, everyone has 
plans B and C, it's Survivor!"?

719
00:37:48,796 --> 00:37:51,788
Yes, because I'm campaigning 
for "We stick to the plan", there.

720
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:54,473
And if a person is considering 
switching to plan B, ...

721
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:57,135
...you don't know if the others... 
We divide, 3 2.

722
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,475
...are considering it too.

723
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,297
So it's important... 
Yeah.

724
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:02,124
...that a plan is followed.

725
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:06,033
Whether it is A, B or C, 
everyone must follow the same.

726
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:10,816
Well, it's time to vote.

727
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,555
Donathan, over to you.

728
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:49,885
I will count the votes.

729
00:38:58,608 --> 00:39:01,312
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

730
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:03,284
now is the time to do it.

731
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,978
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

732
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:12,549
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

733
00:39:12,674 --> 00:39:14,060
I will read the votes.

734
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,618
Donathan.

735
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:26,340
Kelly's. 
Un vote Kellyn,

736
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:28,390
one Donathan vote, one Domenick vote.

737
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,653
Kelly's. 
Deux votes for Kelly.

738
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:37,621
Donathan. 
Two votes Donathan,

739
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:39,710
Deux votes Kellyn, un vote Domenick.

740
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:43,947
Donathan. 
Three votes Donathan,

741
00:39:44,072 --> 00:39:46,300
Deux votes Kellyn, un vote Domenick.

742
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,794
One vote remains.

743
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,034
Kellyn. Equality.

744
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,617
Three Kellyn votes, 
three Donathan votes.

745
00:39:57,304 --> 00:39:59,723
This is what will happen. 
We will vote again.

746
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,351
You can only vote 
for Kellyn and Donathan.

747
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:04,173
Kellyn, Donathan, 
you're not voting.

748
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:06,620
Domenick, over to you. 
Come get the urn.

749
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:33,851
I will count the votes.

750
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:42,704
I will read the votes.

751
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,217
Donathan.

752
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:53,470
Kelly's. 
Un vote Donathan, un vote Kelly.

753
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:01,208
Kelly's. 
Deux votes for Kelly, un vote for Donathan.

754
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,531
Fourteenth Person Eliminated 
and Seventh Jury Member:

755
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:10,180
Kellyn. Three is enough. 
Bring me your torch.

756
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:15,856
I will fight until the end! 
I made you vote twice!

757
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,791
Hello. 
Well done Kelly.

758
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,468
Kellyn, the tribe has spoken.

759
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:31,446
It's time to go.

760
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:34,156
It was really a pleasure,

761
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:35,731
from the bottom of the heart,

762
00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:37,745
I wish you all good luck.

763
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,080
Health!

764
00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:50,289
We're on day 35 
and you're down to six.

765
00:41:50,414 --> 00:41:52,816
And yet this game is still

766
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:54,211
far from over.

767
00:41:54,336 --> 00:41:55,861
Take your torches. Good night.

768
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:08,675
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

769
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:15,261
Next time, 
in the Survivor finale...

770
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:16,791
They are only six.

771
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:19,391
If I'm wrong, it's over.

772
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:20,701
It would be epic.

773
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:23,074
I would love to reverse the curse.

774
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:25,353
With one last visit 
to Ghost Island...

775
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:27,044
My chest is...

776
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,780
...and one final 
million dollar decision.

777
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:32,121
Join us for the final!

778
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:36,139
This adventure came at exactly 
the right time in my life,

779
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:38,656
when I needed to pass

780
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:41,066
of the person 
I thought I should be

781
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,099
to whoever 
I can dream of wanting to be.

782
00:42:44,224 --> 00:42:46,162
I am very grateful

783
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:49,393
to have been able to 
live this unique experience

784
00:42:49,518 --> 00:42:52,008
that I will never forget.
