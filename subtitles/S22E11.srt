1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,877
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,255
MATT, YOU ARE BACK
IN THIS GAME.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,256
WE ARE MERGED.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,257
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,134
AT THE MERGE, MATT QUICKLY

6
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,594
REKINDLED HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH ANDREA.

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,263
>> I'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT WITH

8
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,098
ANDREA BECAUSE I CONSIDER HER
MY CLOSEST ALLY.

9
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,727
>> Jeff: BUT ANDREA ANSWERED
TO A HIGHER POWER.

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,436
>> HERE'S WHAT'S GOING DOWN.

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,146
MATTY'S GOT TO GO HOME TONIGHT.

12
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,774
>> I REALLY LIKE MATT BUT ROB IS

13
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,316
KIND OF THE KING AROUND HERE.

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,318
I MEAN, HE'S VERY SMART.

15
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,445
>> Jeff: AND SHE JOINED HIM

16
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,447
IN HIS SECOND BLINDSIDE OF MATT.

17
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,281
MATT.

18
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,201
ONCE AGAIN,
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

19
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,246
AT REDEMPTION ISLAND, IN THE

20
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,709
FIRST THREE-WAY DUEL,
MATT FACED DAVE AND MIKE.

21
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,294
MIKE AND MATT STAY ALIVE.

22
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,797
AND DAVE BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER
OF THE JURY.

23
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,798
BACK AT CAMP.

24
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,175
>> WE'RE GUARANTEED TO GO
TO THE FINAL SIX.

25
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,510
>> Jeff: THE FORMER
OMETEPE TRIBE

26
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,637
CELEBRATED THEIR NUMBERS
ADVANTAGE.

27
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,972
>> OMETEPE!

28
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,807
>> Jeff: BUT PHILLIP
BROKE UP THE PARTY

29
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,310
WHEN HE GOT INTO A
HEATED ARGUMENT WITH STEVE.

30
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,978
>> EVERY TIME I MAKE AN ARGUMENT

31
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:05,648
WITH ONE OF THOSE GUYS IT'S
I'M ( BLEEP ) CRAZY.

32
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,777
>> Jeff: AND STEVE'S ALLY
JULIE RETALIATED BY HIDING

33
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,486
PHILLIP'S SHORTS.

34
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,821
>> PHILLIP IS GOING TO HAVE TO

35
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,865
HANG OUT IN HIS UNDERWEAR
FROM NOW ON.

36
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,950
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, IT

37
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,162
WAS CLEAR THE FORMER ZAPATERA
TRIBE WAS IN TROUBLE.

38
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,830
UNTIL PHILLIP DIRECTED

39
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,874
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION TO HIMSELF.

40
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,501
>> HE RESORTS
TO CALLING ME CRAZY

41
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,294
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO SAY THE "N" WORD.

42
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,505
HE WANTS TO SAY CRAZY,
CRAZY, CRAZY.

43
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,215
>> Jeff: AND JULIE SURPRISED
EVERYONE WHEN SHE CAME CLEAN.

44
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,842
>> I TOOK THE SHORTS.

45
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,344
NO ONE WILL EVER FIND THEM.

46
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,388
DUG A HOLE AND BURIED THEM
AND A ROCK WAS ON TOP OF THEM.

47
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,849
>> Jeff: BUT SHE GOT AN EVEN
BIGGER SURPRISE WHEN SHE WAS

48
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,767
SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

49
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,230
NOW RALPH AND STEVE
ARE ALL THAT REMAIN

50
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:49,317
OF THE FORMER ZAPATERA TRIBE,
AND THEIR ONLY HOPE,

51
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,444
A CRACK IN THE OMETEPE ALLIANCE.

52
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,341
>> YEAH.

53
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,343
>> I'D LIKE TO REACH OUT AN
OLIVE BRANCH HANDSHAKE TO YOU.

54
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,680
THERE ARE NO APOLOGIZES NEEDED
FROM EITHER ONE OF US.

55
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,348
YOU'RE A MAN. YOU HAD TO SAY
WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY.

56
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,934
>> AS SOON AS WE GOT
BACK TO CAMP

57
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,394
I WAS APPROACHED BY STEVE,
AND HE SAID,

58
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,771
"HEY, MAN,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

59
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,647
I WANT TO BURY THE HATCHET.

60
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,567
I'M NOT A RACIST, MAN.
I'M REALLY NOT.

61
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,652
AND I HOPE WE CAN
GET TOGETHER ON IT,"

62
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,487
AND HE SHOOK MY HAND.

63
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,115
I DON'T FEEL IT WAS
TOTALLY GENUINE.

64
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,409
>> THERE WAS NO PREJUDICE
IN MY CRAZY COMMENT.

65
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,244
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE CRAZY.

66
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,287
>> OKAY, I HEAR YOU.

67
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,289
>> ALL RIGHT?

68
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,082
>> I FELT IT WAS A LITTLE
SELF-SERVING

69
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,919
BECAUSE HE MOCKED ME
A NUMBER OF TIMES,

70
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,422
AND SO PROBABLY STEVE
WILL GO NEXT.

71
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,424
PERFECT, I'M GLAD YOU CAME
AND SPOKE TO ME.

72
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,758
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, MAN.

73
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,093
>> YEAH.

74
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,430
I WOULD REALLY THINK
A MATURE GUY WITH ANY WISDOM

75
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,558
AND ANY EMPATHY
OR HEART OR WHATEVER

76
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,896
WOULD HAVE REACHED OUT AFTER
GOING OFF THE WAY HE DID,

77
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,732
BECAUSE HE HAD TO HAVE KNOWN,
YOU KNOW,

78
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,774
WHAT AN ASS HE MADE OF HIMSELF

79
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,652
BUT I WAS THE ONE WHO
REACHED OUT AND I THINK IT

80
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,486
HAD QUITE A BIT TO DO
WITH SETTLING

81
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,698
THE WHOLE RACE THING
HE BROUGHT UP

82
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,658
AND HOPEFULLY WE BURIED THAT.

83
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,911
>> GOOD BLINDSIDE TONIGHT, TOO.

84
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,412
>> OH, TONIGHT.

85
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,747
YOU GUYS DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING?

86
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,748
>> YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING?

87
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,749
>> YEAH.

88
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,833
>> NO.

89
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,126
>> WE LIKE TO KEEP THINGS
INTERESTING.

90
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,129
>> YEAH, IT WILL MAKE OUR
REMAINING DAYS HERE

91
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,423
EASIER FOR EVERYBODY.

92
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,468
SO I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP
PLUGGING AWAY AND WORKING

93
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,471
THE RELATIONSHIPS
AND BEING OPEN

94
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,473
AND FRIENDLY AND WHO KNOWS?

95
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,852
BOSTON ROB MAY WANT TO JUST KEEP
MYSELF OR RALPH AROUND

96
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,312
AND MAYBE THEY'LL CUT
PHIL LOOSE.

97
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,356
>> I WAS NERVOUS.

98
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,982
I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND
THAT MUCH TIME--

99
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,277
ON RACE AND I WAS LIKE,
OH, MY GOD!

100
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,862
>> PHILLIP IS NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

101
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,821
PHILLIP IS UNDER MY PROTECTION.

102
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,531
AS LONG AS HE KEEPS UP
HIS STUPID ANTICS,

103
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,494
THEY'LL BE COMING TO ME
ALL THE WAY TO THE FINALS.

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,728
>> THE LAST OF ZAPATERA MEN.

105
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,480
>> YUP.

106
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,858
>> WHERE'S NUMBNUTS?

107
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,986
>> HE WENT OUT THERE
TO THE BIG ROCK.

108
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,573
>> MAYBE HE'LL JUMP OFF.

109
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,536
>> YESTERDAY, MY TRUNKS
WERE HIDDEN BY JULIE

110
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,371
BEFORE SHE GOT VOTED OUT.

111
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,374
SO I GOT UP THIS MORNING,
AND I HAD A PREMONITION

112
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,209
THAT I WAS
GOING TO FIND MY SHORTS.

113
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,086
MY GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER,
FULL-BLOODED CHEROKEE INDIAN

114
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,672
CAME TO ME IN A VISION.

115
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,392
AND HE SAID,
"LOOK NEAR THE WATER HOLE."

116
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,269
I KNEW IT WASN'T THE OCEAN
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT,

117
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,562
IT WAS THE DRINKING WATER.

118
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,689
I WENT THERE, FOUND THE FIRST
ROCK, AND TURNED IT OVER.

119
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,233
NO, NOT THERE.

120
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,535
WENT TO THE SECOND ROCK,
THERE MY SHORTS WERE.

121
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,246
AM I GOOD OR WHAT?

122
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,915
AM I GOOD OR WHAT, BABY!

123
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,209
HE BE THE MAN!

124
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,128
HERE'S TO YOU, JULIE.

125
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,880
DON'T MESS WITH
THE UNDERCOVER SPECIALIST

126
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,590
BECAUSE HE MAKES HIS LIVING
UNCOVERING TRUTH,

127
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,427
AND MOST PEOPLE, LIKE YOU,
CAN'T STAND THE TRUTH.

128
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,721
WHAT DID JACK NICHOLSON SAY
TO TOM CRUISE?

129
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,931
"SON, YOU CAN'T STAND THE TRUTH.

130
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,391
YOU CAN'T TAKE THE TRUTH."

131
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,434
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING TO HER.

132
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,394
YOU CANNOT MESS
WITH THE SPECIALIST.

133
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,522
LET THIS BE WARNING TO ALL WHO

134
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,608
WOULD ATTEMPT TO HIDE
SOME SHORTS FROM ME.

135
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,442
IT'S FUTILE.

136
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,862
IT'S FRIVOLOUS.

137
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,781
BECAUSE WITHOUT A CLUE.

138
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,990
>> WHAT?

139
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,241
HOW DID YOU FIND THAT?

140
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,951
>> BABY, YOU KNOW,
I'M THE SPECIALIST.

141
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,286
ALL RIGHT?

142
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,246
YEAH, BABY.

143
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,791
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

144
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,293
WE'RE AT PEACE NOW.

145
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,421
>> YOU BAD!

146
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,798
YOU BAD, BABY!

147
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,841
>> PHILLIP,
HE'S A DIFFERENT BREED.

148
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,426
AGAIN, THERE'S NO PREJUDICE

149
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,303
BEHIND IT, BUT HE'S
A LITTLE CRAZY.

150
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,933
IT'S-- IT'S CRAZY.

151
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,185
HEY!

152
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,312
>> HE'S A FREAKING LUNATIC.

153
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,647
I THINK THEY'RE GETTING
TIRED OF HIM, TOO.

154
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,149
>> I GOT SHORTS, BABY.

155
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,526
WOOO!

156
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,485
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
FIND THEM SHORTS,

157
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,529
AS SHE PARTED LAST NIGHT.

158
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,658
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW UP
WITH THEM TODAY.

159
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,660
>> WITH YOUR SHORTS ON.

160
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,661
>> YOU GOT IT.

161
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,662
NO CLUE, NOTHING.

162
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,663
>> SWEET.

163
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,664
>> YEAH.

164
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,165
I NEED TO GO GET THAT ROCK.

165
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,667
THAT BIG OLD ROCK
SHE TALKED ABOUT.

166
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,835
I AM SO EXCITED

167
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,795
ABOUT SEEING JULIE
AT THE DUEL TODAY

168
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,381
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SHOW UP
IN THESE SHORTS.

169
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,341
MY NEW FOOTREST.

170
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,010
AND SHE'S GOING TO KNOW THAT YOU

171
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,139
CAN'T PULL THE WOOL OVER
THE UNDERCOVER SPECIALIST.

172
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,224
I AM TRULY BLESSED.

173
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,614
>> WERE YOU ABLE TO GET
SOME WINKS LAST NIGHT, JULIE?

174
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,909
>> OH, MY GOSH.
I SLEPT SO GOOD.

175
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,203
DAY WHAT, 28?

176
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,705
27 NIGHTS.

177
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,123
THAT WAS THE BEST NIGHT
I'VE EVER SLEPT.

178
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,833
>> ALL RIGHT.

179
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,419
>> IT GETS HARDER AND HARD
TO GET UP EVERY MORNING.

180
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,838
MATT HAD INCREDIBLE STRENGTH

181
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,424
GOING THROUGH REDEMPTION ISLAND
THE FIRST TIME.

182
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,760
AFTER HE WAS BLINDSIDED
THE SECOND TIME

183
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,805
BY THE FOLKS HE THOUGHT
WERE TRULY HIS FRIENDS,

184
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,518
HE'S KIND OF BEEN ON
A LITTLE DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

185
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,314
>> I'M GONNA GO SIT ON THE BEACH
FOR LITTLE WHILE.

186
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:01,898
>> OKAY.

187
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,401
MATT HAS GREAT FAITH,

188
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,737
AND HE'S ABLE TO ENDURE
A LOT OF HARDSHIP

189
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,739
BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH IN GOD.

190
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,741
>> POOR MATT.
HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S DONE.

191
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,535
>> YEAH, HE'S PRETTY DOWN.

192
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,745
BUT YOU CAN TELL HE'S KIND OF
AT HIS BREAKING POINT.

193
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,456
YOU KNOW IT'S ALL THOSE
SUBCONSCIOUS THINGS.

194
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,416
HE'S ALREADY THINKING ABOUT
GOING HOME,

195
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,294
AND THAT CAN AFFECT
THE OUTCOME OF A CHALLENGE.

196
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,254
>> I THINK COMING BACK HERE WAS

197
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,048
REALLY, REALLY ROUGH ON HIM.

198
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,258
IT TOOK A LOT OF THE WIND
OUT OF HIS SAILS

199
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,636
AND AFTER BEING HERE
FOR THREE WEEKS AND COMPETING

200
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,722
IN, LIKE, SIX DUELS.

201
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,726
>> THIS IS UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE

202
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,603
EVER REALLY EXPERIENCED.

203
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,565
I'M OUT HERE WASTING AWAY.

204
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,152
I'M MISSING MY FAMILY.

205
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,655
I CAN'T-- I CAN ONLY FEEL THEM

206
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,781
WHEN I REALLY, REALLY TRY.

207
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,784
>> I GUESS HE WAS REALLY CLOSE
TO ANDREA, TOO,

208
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,911
AND I GUESS SHE
WAS JUST SHARING EVERYTHING

209
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:57,912
THAT HE WAS TELLING HER.

210
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,913
>> I FIGURED.

211
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,914
>> WITH THE TRIBE.

212
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,332
>> I NEVER DID TRUST HER.

213
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,667
>> NO, SHE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

214
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,753
>> I NEVER DID TRUST HER.

215
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,630
>> GOD HAS ME HERE FOR A REASON.

216
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:12,134
I SAID THIS FROM THE BEGINNING
THAT GOD WANTED ME HERE.

217
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,720
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE REASON IS FOR.

218
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,639
I CAN'T SEE THAT YET.

219
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,808
BUT I KNOW HE WANTS ME
TO BE HERE.

220
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,270
HE'S LITERALLY BEEN...

221
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,946
GOD HAS LITERALLY
BEEN CARRYING ME

222
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,990
FOR THE PAST FOUR DAYS.

223
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,659
I KNOW I'M STILL IN THE GAME BUT

224
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,412
I'M SO OVER THIS GAME.

225
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,800
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE COMPETITORS

226
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,012
FOR TODAY'S DUEL.

227
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,890
MATT, MIKE, AND JULIE.

228
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,150
MATT, 21 DAYS.

229
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,401
>> OH!

230
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,527
>> Jeff: ON REDEMPTION.

231
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,364
ONLY SEVEN DAYS IN THE REGULAR
GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

232
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,699
WHERE ARE YOU AT WITH THIS?

233
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,869
YOU'VE HAD AN INCREDIBLE
ROLLER COASTER

234
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,537
OF EMOTIONS OUT HERE.

235
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,206
>> JUST OVERWHELMING PEACE
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

236
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,875
I FELT THIS NEED
THAT IF I KEPT WINNING,

237
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,836
I COULD HONOR MY GOD
MORE AND MORE.

238
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,213
BUT HE JUST KIND OF HIT ME
WITH A LOT OF PEACE,

239
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,214
AND HE WAS JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW,

240
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,593
YOU'VE HONORED ME ENOUGH,
AND IF I GO BACK,

241
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,596
I GO BACK, AND IF I GO HOME,
THEN I GO HOME.

242
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,181
AND I'M AT PEACE WITH THAT.

243
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,891
>> Jeff: THIS IS A VERY
DIFFERENT MATT

244
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,726
THAN I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST.

245
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,228
IT SOUND TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE READY TO GO HOME.

246
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,938
>> UH, I'M GOING TO DO
THE BEST

247
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,565
I CAN IN TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

248
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,400
BUT, YEAH, I THINK
I'M READY TO GO HOME.

249
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,694
THE ONLY REASON I WAS STAYING
IN THIS GAME

250
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,447
IS BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THERE WAS MORE OF GOD'S WILL

251
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,907
TO ACCOMPLISH, AND I FEEL
LIKE I'VE ACCOMPLISHED

252
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,242
WHAT I CAME HERE TO DO.

253
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,120
SO WHATEVER HAPPENS,
I'M READY FOR IT.

254
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,414
>> Jeff: LET'S GET
TO TODAY'S DUEL.

255
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,875
IT IS "SURVIVOR" SHUFFLEBOARD.

256
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,752
YOU WILL EACH HAVE ONE

257
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,921
SHUFFLEBOARD AND THREE PUCKS.

258
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,964
YOUR GOAL-- SLIDE YOUR PUCK

259
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,925
ACROSS YOUR BOARD THROUGH THE

260
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,094
OBSTACLE, INTO THE END ZONE.

261
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,262
IF ANY PART OF YOUR PUCK TOUCHES

262
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:20,971
THE END ZONE, IT COUNTS.

263
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,225
THE FIRST TWO TO LAND ALL THREE

264
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,768
OF THEIR PUCKS IN THE END ZONE

265
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,936
STAY ALIVE ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

266
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,772
LOSER IS OUT OF THIS GAME
FOR GOOD

267
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,109
AND WILL BECOME THE NEXT
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

268
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,443
CLEAR?

269
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,444
>> CLEAR.

270
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,570
>> CLEAR.

271
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,822
>> Jeff: THIS IS MOST
DEFINITELY IT.

272
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,823
ONE SHOT.

273
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,033
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

274
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,288
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

275
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,458
MATT, YOU'RE UP
WITH THE FIRST SHOT.

276
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,420
THAT FIRST OBSTACLE, NO GOOD.

277
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,464
MIKE IS UP.

278
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,801
MIKE LANDS HIS FIRST PUCK
IN THE END ZONE.

279
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,637
JULIE'S UP.

280
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,973
JULIE SHORT.

281
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,392
WE'LL CLEAR THE PUCKS
EACH ROUND,

282
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,102
EXCEPT THE ONES
IN THE END ZONE.

283
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:08,978
THOSE WILL STAY.

284
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,273
KEEP YOUR BOARD CLEAN FOR YOU.

285
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,818
MIKE HAS ONE PUCK
IN THE END ZONE.

286
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,820
MATT AND JULIE ZERO.

287
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,823
MATT IS UP.

288
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,992
MATT SHORT AGAIN.

289
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,661
MIKE WITH ANOTHER NICE TOSS.

290
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,037
THAT IS IN THE END ZONE.

291
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,664
MIKE MAKING IT LOOK EASY.

292
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,332
HE HAS TWO OF HIS PUCKS
IN THE END ZONE.

293
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,460
JULIE, YOU'RE UP.

294
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,589
JULIE LANDS ONE IN THE END ZONE.

295
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,007
JULIE WITH HER FIRST PUCK.

296
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,843
MATT, YOU'VE GOT TO GET
ON THE BOARD.

297
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,928
>> I'M WORKING ON IT.

298
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,766
>> Jeff: MATT LANDS ONE
IN THE END ZONE,

299
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,977
JUST BARELY,
BUT THAT WILL COUNT.

300
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,024
>> MATT'S KIND OF PISSED AT ME.

301
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,984
I MADE EYE CONTACT KIND OF, AND

302
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,153
IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE HE GAVE ME
A REALLY DIRTY LOOK.

303
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,863
I COULD HAVE BEEN READING
INTO IT,

304
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,031
BUT IT WAS JUST, LIKE,
A WEIRD FEELING.

305
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,867
>> Jeff: MIKE COULD STAY ALIVE

306
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,536
ON REDEMPTION WITH THIS SHOT
RIGHT HERE.

307
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,163
NOPE.

308
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,374
JULIE SHORT.

309
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,543
MATT LOOKING
FOR THAT SECOND PUCK.

310
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,046
AND HE'S GOT IT.

311
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,215
MATT NOW WITH TWO PUCKS.

312
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,884
ALL IT TAKES IS THREE
TO STAY ALIVE.

313
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,094
MIKE IS SHORT.

314
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:28,349
JULIE LOOKING TO LAND
THAT SECOND PUCK AND STAY EVEN.

315
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,726
SHORT AGAIN.

316
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,853
MATT, YOU'RE UP.

317
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,734
GOD IS NOT DONE TALKING TO MATT.

318
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,861
MATT HAS THREE PUCKS
IN THE END ZONE.

319
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,863
YOU ARE STAYING ALIVE
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

320
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,407
WHETHER YOU WANT
TO BE HERE OR NOT.

321
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,535
HERE'S WHERE WE STAND--

322
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,579
TWO PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO STAY ALIVE ON REDEMPTION.

323
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,748
ONE IS OUT OF THIS GAME
FOR GOOD.

324
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,792
MIKE HAS TWO PUCKS
IN THE END ZONE.

325
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,752
JULIE HAS ONLY ONE.

326
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,256
MIKE COULD DO IT RIGHT HERE
WITH THIS SHOT.

327
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,590
CAN HE DO IT?

328
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,591
OH!

329
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,592
>> OH!

330
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,593
>> Jeff: JUST SHORT.

331
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,094
LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH.

332
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,137
JULIE STAYS ALIVE.

333
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,180
>> COME ON, JULIE.

334
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,266
>> Jeff: JULIE, GOTTA LAND THIS.

335
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,935
JULIE LANDS ONE IN THE END ZONE

336
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,770
BUT KNOCKS ANOTHER ONE OUT.

337
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,105
JULIE STAYS RIGHT WHERE SHE WAS

338
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,440
WITH ONLY ONE PUCK
IN THE END ZONE.

339
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,776
MIKE COULD DO IT RIGHT HERE.

340
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,240
AND HE DOES!

341
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,118
MIKE AND MATT STAY ALIVE
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

342
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,036
>> IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

343
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,998
GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

344
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,549
>> Jeff: SO, MATT,
ARE YOU FRUSTRATED

345
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,135
WITH YOUR GOD RIGHT NOW?

346
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,512
>> I MEAN, YOU JUST GOTTA
BE ACCEPTING.

347
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,181
I GUESS HE STILL WANTS ME HERE
FOR SOME REASON.

348
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,142
I TOLD HIM I'D STAY HERE
AS LONG AS HE WANTED TO.

349
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,477
>> Jeff: HOW MANY DAYS
DID JESUS FAST?

350
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,520
>> 40.

351
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:01,442
>> Jeff: IT'S INTERESTING
OUR GAME IS 39 DAYS.

352
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,027
DOING WELL SO FAR.

353
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,405
JULIE, AFTER 28 DAYS.

354
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,699
>> 28 DAYS, YEAH,
OF NOT BRUSHING YOUR TEETH.

355
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,326
HOLY MOLY.

356
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,285
>> Jeff: WHY WERE YOU OUT HERE?

357
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,996
>> I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE
TO MAKE FRIENDS.

358
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,000
LIKE MANY AMERICANS,
MY HOUSE IS IN FORECLOSURE,

359
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:23,213
AND THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME TO MAKE

360
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,340
A BETTER LIFE FOR MY GIRLS.

361
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,010
AND MY KIDS ARE PROUD OF ME
EITHER WAY, YOU KNOW.

362
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,805
AND I CAME SHORT OF THE MONEY,

363
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,725
BUT I'M WALKING AWAY
WITH SOMETHING BIGGER.

364
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,185
MY LIFE IS-- IS CHANGED.

365
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,521
I SEE MATT'S STORY WITH GOD,

366
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,523
AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD
TO GOING BACK HOME,

367
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,485
FINDING A CHURCH,
AND JUST GETTING INVOLVED.

368
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,695
>> Jeff: JULIE, YOUR SHOT
AT THE MONEY IS OVER.

369
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,989
YOU ARE OUT OF THIS GAME.

370
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,201
YOU CAN TOSS YOUR BUFF
IN THE URN ON THE WAY OUT.

371
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,203
BUT YOU'RE NOT LEAVING US.

372
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,705
YOU'RE GOING TO RETURN AND BE
A SECOND MEMBER OF THE JURY.

373
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,915
>> WAY TO GO, JULEZ.

374
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,916
>> I LOVE YOU GUYS.

375
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,958
( APPLAUSE )

376
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,210
GOOD LUCK.

377
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,088
>> PEANUT BUTTER AND OATMEAL!

378
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,225
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
YOU BOTH STAY ALIVE

379
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,061
TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY
ON REDEMPTION.

380
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,104
NICE WORK.

381
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,563
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK.

382
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,231
>> THANKS, JEFF.

383
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,068
>> HANG IN THERE, MATT.

384
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,739
>> I HOPE THAT MATT STAYS,
AND MAYBE HE CAN COME BACK.

385
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,408
AND, LIKE, IF HE CAME BACK
IN THE GAME,

386
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,826
I'D, LIKE, WANT TO TALK TO HIM

387
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,786
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE CAN REALLY TRUST ME,

388
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,413
LIKE, IN THIS GAME EVER AGAIN.

389
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,832
WHY WOULD HE?

390
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,147
>> IT FELT WEIRD.
LIKE, I FELT, LIKE, REALLY BAD

391
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,315
ABOUT MYSELF FOR, LIKE,
PLAYING HIM.

392
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,151
YOU KNOW, FOR ALL OF US
PLAYING HIM.

393
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,193
>> NO--

394
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,153
>> I DID.

395
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,321
>> THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED.

396
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,282
LIKE, HE DIDN'T WANT
TO PLAY THE GAME.

397
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,617
>> LIKE HIS SPIRIT
SEEMED BROKEN.

398
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,452
I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS WEIRD.

399
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,871
IT WAS JUST, LIKE
A WEIRD FEELING.

400
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,331
MATT WAS LIKE, I DON'T CARE
IF I GO OUT.

401
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,126
I FEEL BAD BECAUSE I PLAYED HIM
THE HARDEST.

402
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,463
I HAD CLOSE CONVERSATIONS
WITH HIM

403
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,173
AND HE SAID HE FORGIVES US
ALL AND STUFF

404
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,468
BUT I THINK HE'S
KIND OF PISSED AT ME.

405
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,845
>> WE ALL PUT HIM THERE,
YOU KNOW.

406
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:35,971
>> UH-HUH.

407
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:36,972
>> IT WASN'T JUST YOU.

408
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,182
>> NO, I KNOW.

409
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,224
I JUST--

410
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,309
>> YEAH--

411
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,310
>> I DEFINITELY PLAYED HIM
THE HARDEST.

412
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,979
I FEEL LIKE I WAS A BIG PART OF,

413
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,272
LIKE, BREAKING HIS SPIRIT.

414
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,107
SO IN A WAY I KIND OF, LIKE,

415
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,985
FELT A LITTLE GUILTY
ON A HUMAN LEVEL,

416
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,529
NOT ON A GAME LEVEL.

417
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,415
>> I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

418
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,501
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

419
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,795
BECAUSE, ONE, SHE IS PRETTY GOOD
IN CHALLENGES,

420
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,671
AS FAR AS PUZZLES AND STUFF GO.

421
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,340
BUT WE DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT--

422
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,674
>> AND SHE'S, LIKE, FRIENDS

423
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,551
WITH WITH ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE
OVER THERE,

424
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,637
AND SHE'S HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS.

425
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,847
>> I THINK, DUDE,
THE FIRST CHANCE WE GET,

426
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,974
GET HER OUT OF THERE.

427
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,184
I'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT ANDREA

428
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,020
AND MATT'S RELATIONSHIP.

429
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,814
IF HE COMES BACK
FROM REDEMPTION ISLAND,

430
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,689
WE GOT BACK FROM THE CHALLENGE,

431
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,234
AND SHE SAID SHE FELT
SORRY FOR HIM.

432
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,361
IT'S THINGS LIKE THAT JUST--

433
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,404
YOU'RE KIND OF SHAKING
YOUR HEAD GOING,

434
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,532
AH, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE LEARNED.

435
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,201
IF WE PLAY THIS RIGHT,
IT SHOULD BE SMOOTH SAILING.

436
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,202
>> WE'RE GOOD.

437
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,245
>> WE'RE GOOD.

438
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,540
>> WE DECIDE WHO GOES WHEN,
AND THAT'S IT.

439
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,542
>> THE UPSIDE
TO GETTING RID OF ANDREA

440
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,543
BEFORE GETTING RID OF STEVE
AND RALPH

441
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,087
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE
LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT.

442
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,464
THEN AGAIN, TIMING
IS EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME.

443
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,716
WHEN TO PULL THE TRIGGER
AS FAR AS WHEN

444
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,343
TO VOTE PEOPLE OFF IS HUGE.

445
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,887
AND IT MIGHT COME DOWN TO JUST

446
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,347
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, YOU KNOW.

447
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,981
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

448
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,867
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

449
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,868
>> YES.

450
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,202
>> YES.

451
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,495
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
BOSTON ROB, GIVE IT UP.

452
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,752
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

453
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,047
IN TODAY'S CHALLENGE,
YOU WILL COMPETE IN A LOG ROLL.

454
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,633
YOU WILL MATCH UP AGAINST
ANOTHER TRIBEMEMBER.

455
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,509
YOUR GOAL-- STAY ON THE LOG

456
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,262
LONGER THAN THE OTHER PERSON.

457
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,390
FIRST PERSON TO HIT THE WATER
IS OUT, WINNERS MOVE ON.

458
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,436
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING
WINS IMMUNITY, IS SAFE.

459
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,438
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE

460
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,982
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT AND

461
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,734
SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

462
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,111
IN ADDITION TODAY,
YOU ARE PLAYING FOR REWARD.

463
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,114
AFTER 30 DAYS, I CAN'T IMAGINE

464
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,617
ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE
A SWEET TOOTH.

465
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,618
>> OH!

466
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,619
>> MY GOD!

467
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,995
>> OH, MY GOSH!

468
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,622
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I ASKED FOR.

469
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,582
>> Jeff: CHOCOLATE CAKE.

470
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,876
AND, OF COURSE, ICE COLD MILK.

471
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,835
>> OH!

472
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,836
>> OH, MAN!

473
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,962
>> Jeff: IN ADDITION TODAY,

474
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,464
ONE OTHER TWIST, WHICH I WILL
TELL YOU ABOUT LATER.

475
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,008
I KNOW IT'S WORTH PLAYING FOR.

476
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,508
WE'LL DRAW FOR MATCH-UPS.

477
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,303
WE'LL GET STARTED.

478
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,141
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,569
>> YEAH, I'M IN A LEAGUE,
A LEAGUE EVERY SATURDAY.

00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,624
THIS IS IT.

526
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,626
GRANT AND RALPH.

527
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,503
>> LET'S GO, BIG COUNTRY.

528
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,925
>> GOOD JOB, GRANT.

529
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,968
>> Jeff: GOT A GOOD MATCH GOING.

530
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,845
NICE RECOVERY.

531
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,640
ANOTHER NICE RECOVERY.

532
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,315
>> LET'S GO, RALPH.

533
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,609
>> Jeff: BOTH GUYS LOOKING
PRETTY COMFORTABLE.

534
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,531
WHO'S GOING IN FIRST?

535
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,662
RALPH IS IN, GRANT WINS IMMUNITY

536
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,580
AND CHOCOLATE CAKE!

537
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,790
>> YEAH, GRANT!

538
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,500
>> GRANT!

539
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,670
>> Jeff: GRANT, NICE WORK.

540
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,510
GRANT SAFE TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

541
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,178
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT
OF THIS GAME.

542
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,973
IN ADDITION, YOU'VE WON
A HUGE CHOCOLATE CAKE.

543
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,391
>> IT IS PRETTY BIG.

544
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,809
>> Jeff: IT IS PRETTY BIG,
AND I KNOW

545
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,894
EVEN AFTER A MONTH
AND A MOUTH FULL OF SWEET TEETH

546
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,645
YOU COULDN'T EAT
THAT CAKE ALONE.

547
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,647
>> I COULDN'T.

548
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,733
>> Jeff: CHOOSE ONE PERSON
TO JOIN YOU.

549
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,819
>> GUYS, I'M SORRY, I GOTTA--

550
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,488
ROB, COME ON DOWN.

551
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,365
( APPLAUSE )

552
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,742
>> I WISH EVERYBODY
COULD HAVE SOME.

553
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,785
I'M SORRY.

554
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,744
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

555
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,621
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GRANT,

556
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,583
CHOOSE ONE MORE PERSON
TO EAT WITH YOU.

557
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,585
>> MAN, I'D HUG YOUR NECK

558
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,711
IF YOU'D LET ME
EAT SOME OF THAT.

559
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,047
>> Jeff: THAT MAY JUST PUT YOU
OUT OF THE RUNNING.

560
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,716
>> I'M NOT A GAY PERSON,

561
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,135
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

562
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,389
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GRANT,
ONE MORE CHOICE.

563
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,224
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?

564
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,976
>> AH...

565
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,063
ANDREA, COME ON DOWN.

566
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,231
I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS.

567
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:43,690
I'M SORRY!

568
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,276
>> THANK YOU.

569
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,862
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

570
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,407
AND THE TWIST THAT I
REFERRED TO EARLIER.

571
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,034
DO NOT OPEN THAT.

572
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,577
IT IS FOR THE TRIBE.

573
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,953
BRING IT WITH YOU TONIGHT
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

574
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,038
>> OKAY.

575
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,289
>> ALL RIGHT.

576
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,749
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO ROB,
ANDREA, AND GRANT

577
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,751
ARE GOING TO FEAST
ON CHOCOLATE CAKE.

578
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,421
YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES
TO EAT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

579
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,424
THE TWO MINUTES START NOW.

580
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,593
>> JUST EAT IT LIKE A PIG.

581
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,677
>> I DON'T WANT TO CHOKE.

582
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,762
>> THERE IS SO MUCH
RICH FUDGE IN THERE.

583
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,057
>> THANK YOU.

584
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,809
>> I WISH EVERYBODY
COULD HAVE SOME.

585
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,602
>> DON'T TALK.

586
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,188
JUST EAT.

587
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,774
>> I CHOSE ANDREA
AS A STRATEGIC MOVE

588
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,318
OF WANTING TO MAKE HER FEEL
COMFORTABLE IN OUR ALLIANCE,

589
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,028
BECAUSE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL,

590
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,780
IF CERTAIN SCENARIOS COME UP,

591
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,491
WHERE WE NEED TO GET RID
OF ONE OF OUR OWN,

592
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,285
ANDREA IS GOING TO BE
THAT MEMBER.

593
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,315
>> YOU GUYS ARE GOOD!

594
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,655
>> WE GOT A MYSTERY PACKAGE.

595
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,115
JEFF GAVE IT TO US AND SAID WE

596
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,158
HAD TO OPEN IT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

597
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,036
IT COULD BE SOMETHING WHERE WE--

598
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,788
YOU KNOW, WE GO, WE VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

599
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,499
AND THE TWIST IS WE VOTE
ANOTHER PERSON OUT,

600
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,002
OR SOMETHING LIKE
CRAZY OUTLANDISH.

601
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,045
>> WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
THE TWIST IS?

602
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:29,921
>> I DON'T KNOW.

603
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,049
>> IT FEELS LIKE A DECK
OF CARDS, HUH?

604
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,759
>> LIKE IF YOU PICK THE WRONG
CARD YOU'RE GOING HOME?

605
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,012
>> MAYBE.

606
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,971
>> THE WHOLE CARD THING
KIND OF THREW ME OFF

607
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,473
BUT RIGHT NOW
EVERYBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE

608
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,018
BECAUSE THERE ARE THE TWO EASY
VOTES, RALPH AND STEVE.

609
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,061
>> I'M BEAT, MAN.

610
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,691
>> I THINK THAT US SIX HAVING
SO MUCH FAITH IN EACH OTHER,

611
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,736
I THINK IT WOULD BE SILLY
TO GET RID

612
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,697
OF ONE OF OUR OWN
BEFORE THE ZAPATERA PEOPLE.

613
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,159
>> PARDON ME?

614
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,746
>> ONE MORE TIME.

615
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,585
>> CAN'T PULL ANOTHER WIN.

616
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,713
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.

617
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,675
I THOUGHT I COULD DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

618
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,719
GAVE IT ALL I HAD.

619
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,220
ONE OF US IS ON
THE CHOPPING BLOCK,

620
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,181
AND IT'S PROBABLY ME.

621
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,185
ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE
WHATEVER IS IN THAT LITTLE BOX

622
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:25,852
THAT JEFF SAID
TO DEFINITELY BRING

623
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,854
IS GOOD NEWS FOR ME.

624
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,273
IT MIGHT NOT BE.

625
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:30,940
CHANCES IT BEING FOR ME, NO,

626
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,526
BUT ALL I'M DOING IS HOPING.

627
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,736
ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE.

628
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,489
>> THOSE CARDS WILL STIR UP
SOMETHING TONIGHT.

629
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,991
ME, I'M READY TO DROP.

630
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,162
MY STRENGTH IS-- IS--

631
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,334
MY STOMACH IS JUST SUCKED IN.

632
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,216
>> THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON
RIGHT NOW--

633
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,884
STEVE'S THINKING, I'VE HAD IT.

634
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,885
I'M DONE.

635
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,887
SO STEVE'S NOT
GOING TO DO ANYTHING

636
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,765
TO CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS
WITH ANYBODY.

637
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,266
RALPH, ON THE OTHER HAND,

638
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,102
POSES A THREAT
BECAUSE PHYSICALLY,

639
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,771
HE'S CAPABLE AND HIS HEAD
IS STILL IN THE GAME

640
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,399
SO RALPH'S GOT TO GO NEXT.

641
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,943
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE
HAS TO BE A TWIST.

642
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,320
ALWAYS A TWIST.

643
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,321
>> I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THE TWIST.

644
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,449
>> I AM, TOO, BECAUSE
THE BALL'S IN OUR COURT.

645
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,285
>> WHO KNOWS WHAT THIS TWIST
IS ALL ABOUT.

646
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,122
MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE HAS
A CHANCE TO WIN IMMUNITY.

647
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,124
MAYBE IT'S A SITUATION
WHERE TWO PEOPLE

648
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,000
ARE GOING TO GO HOME
BUT WE ONLY GET TO VOTE ONCE.

649
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,419
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

650
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,295
SO WE'VE GOT TO HEDGE OUR BETS

651
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,589
AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE
BACKUP PLANS

652
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,508
AND KNOW WHO WE'RE VOTING FOR.

653
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,469
GRANT AND I, WE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT GETTING RID OF ANDREA

654
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:46,349
BEFORE ZAPATERA,
SO IT LEAVES US OTHER OPTIONS.

655
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,119
>> TONIGHT,
IT'S OBVIOUSLY RALPH.

656
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,997
IF IT'S A TWIST AND WE HAVE
TO GET RID OF TWO PEOPLE--

657
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,540
>> IF WE HAVE TO VOTE
SOMEBODY ELSE OFF.

658
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,249
>> THEN IT'S HER.

659
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,294
>> ROB'S VERY SMART, AND HE'S

660
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,671
PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE, AND SO

661
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,047
WE'RE KIND OF TAKING
OUR LEAD FROM HIM.

662
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,008
WE'RE VOTING FOR RALPH TONIGHT.

663
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,552
THERE'S ALSO A TWIST, THOUGH,

664
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,138
AND WE MAY HAVE TO VOTE OUT
TWO PEOPLE TONIGHT,

665
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,974
IN WHICH CASE,
ANDREA WILL GO HOME.

666
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,310
IF MATT COMES BACK
FROM REDEMPTION ISLAND,

667
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,187
SHE'S STILL GOT
A SOFT SPOT FOR MATT,

668
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,814
SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE
TO GET HER OUT.

669
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,203
YOU THREE GIRLS COULD TURN THIS

670
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,829
WHOLE THING UPSIDE DOWN.

671
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,706
I WOULD GUARANTEE YOU THAT ROB'S

672
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,041
PRETTY MUCH MAKING THE DECISIONS

673
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,376
WHO COMES AND WHO GOES.

674
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,836
HE'LL START PICKING
YOU GUYS OFF,

675
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,005
AND TAKE NIMROD WITH HIM
TO THE FINALS.

676
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,131
NOBODY WILL VOTE FOR NIMROD.

677
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,551
SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE
VOTING FOR ROB TONIGHT.

678
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,929
IF YOU THREE JUMP IN,
IT'S YOUR GAME.

679
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,223
>> WE'LL CONSIDER.

680
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,974
THANK YOU.

681
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,072
>> STEVE CAME UP TO US
AND WAS BASICALLY LIKE

682
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,367
OUR TWO VOTES ARE GOING FOR ROB,

683
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,953
SO IF YOU THREE GIRLS
WANT TO MAKE A BIG MOVE,

684
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,914
LIKE, NOW'S THE TIME,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

685
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,166
WHICH, OBVIOUSLY,
WE DIDN'T ENTERTAIN.

686
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,126
>> I KNEW THEY WERE
GOING TO DO THIS.

687
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,045
IT'S THEIR LAST ATTEMPT,
AND THAT'S WHY

688
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,755
THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO GET ANYTHING THEY CAN

689
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,757
AND DO WHATEVER THEY CAN.

690
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,051
SO LET'S JUST HANG IN THERE.

691
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,678
>> YEAH.

692
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,222
>> IT SEEMED LIKE STEVE MAY HAVE
GOTTEN HIS SECOND WIND.

693
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,558
HE'S GOING TO MEMBERS OF MY
ALLIANCE BEHIND MY BACK

694
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,227
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN
TO GET ME OUT OF HERE,

695
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,730
WHICH MAKES ME THINK I SHOULD
MAYBE GET RID OF HIM FIRST.

696
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,941
WHAT I WAS ORIGINALLY
THINKING ABOUT

697
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,025
I'M THINKING ABOUT NOT DOING NOW

698
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:05,905
BECAUSE I MAY HAVE TO WAIT
TO GET RID OF ANDREA.

699
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,251
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

700
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,716
DAVID AND JULIE.

701
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,806
ROB, THE LAST THREE
TRIBAL COUNCILS,

702
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,641
ZAPATERA, ZAPATERA, ZAPATERA.

703
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,143
IS THAT WHERE WE ARE AGAIN?

704
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,978
IS IT GOING TO BE STEVE
OR RALPH?

705
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,730
>> MOST LIKELY.

706
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,607
UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

707
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,984
>> Jeff: STEVE,
YOU KIND OF SENSE THAT,

708
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,778
THAT THIS OMETEPE GROUP
IS UNBREAKABLE?

709
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,447
>> SURE, YEAH,
THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL.

710
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,325
WE'VE TRIED TO STIR IT UP
AND RAISE A LITTLE HAVOC.

711
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,954
WE'VE TOLD VARIOUS GROUPS
WHO RALPH AND I ARE VOTING FOR,

712
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,997
AND IF THEY WANT
TO JUMP ON BOARD,

713
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,458
IT COULD BE HUGE TONIGHT.

714
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,169
>> Jeff: ANDREA, STEVE DOES
MAKE A GOOD POINT.

715
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,297
AT MOST, THE OMETEPE SIX
HAVE TWO MORE VOTES.

716
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,673
STEVE AND RALPH.

717
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,258
THERE IS A CERTAIN TIME WHEN IT

718
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,677
MIGHT MAKE SENSE
TO SAY I'M MAKING A MOVE.

719
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,220
>> I MEAN, IT DOES MAKE SENSE
STRATEGICALLY,

720
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,182
BUT I FEEL COMPLETELY SAFE
THAT WE'RE ALL ROCK SOLID

721
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,225
BECAUSE WE REALLY DO
FEEL LIKE WE'VE WORKED HARD

722
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,562
TO GET TO THE PLACE
THAT WE'RE AT.

723
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,189
>> Jeff: RALPH, ODDS ARE,
TONIGHT'S VOTE,

724
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,775
ONE OF YOU TWO ARE GOING HOME.

725
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,860
>> WELL, I WENT A LITTLE FURTHER
IN THE GAME TONIGHT.

726
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:28,029
I'D SAY IT'S GOING TO BE ME.

727
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,365
>> Jeff: STEVE, HOW ABOUT YOU?

728
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,242
>> I'M THINKING IT MOST LIKELY
WOULD BE RALPH.

729
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,204
RALPH'S BEEN REALLY TOUGH
IN THE CHALLENGES.

730
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,331
BETTER PERFORMING THAN MYSELF.

731
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,582
SO...

732
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,543
>> Jeff: ROB, THAT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO SAY IF YOU'RE STEVE.

733
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,212
"I DON'T HAVE MUCH ENERGY.

734
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,047
I'M KIND OF WORTHLESS
IN CHALLENGES.

735
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,674
VOTE HIM OUT."

736
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,217
>> IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO SAY
IF HE WANTS TO STAY.

737
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,552
>> UH-HUH.

738
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,680
>> BUT, JEFF,
YOU CAN'T TAKE STEVE'S

739
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,099
LACKADAISICAL ANSWER
AS "I'M QUITTING."

740
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,393
THE DUDE PLAYED IN THE NFL.

741
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,394
HE'S NOT QUITTING.

742
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,395
>> Jeff: NOT A QUITTER.

743
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,562
>> HE'S NOT A QUITTER.

744
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,398
>> I WOULD SECOND
WHAT GRANT JUST SAID

745
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,192
BECAUSE I'M RECOGNIZING
THAT HE'S NOT AS FEEBLE

746
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,236
AS BEING PUT OUT THERE.

747
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,614
I THINK HE COULD STEP UP
AT THE RIGHT CHALLENGE.

748
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,242
GOTCHA.

749
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,077
>> Jeff: STEVE,
BEFORE WE GO TO THE VOTE,

750
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,746
THIS COULD BE
YOUR LAST CHANCE TO SPEAK UP.

751
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,791
>> I REMIND THE GIRLS
OF THE SEASONS PAST,

752
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,919
BOSTON ROB ASKED A GUY
TO SAVE HIS GIRLFRIEND,

753
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,506
AMBER, THEN CUT HIM LOOSE
THE FIRST CHANCE HE HAD.

754
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,259
SO IT WILL GET BRUTAL
AFTER RALPH AND I ARE GONE.

755
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,138
SO IT'S NOW OR NEVER
TO DO SOMETHING LARGE.

756
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,141
>> Jeff: STEVE IS BRINGING UP
"SURVIVOR: ALL-STARS"

757
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,935
IN WHICH IF YOU'RE
A "SURVIVOR" FAN YOU KNOW

758
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,270
ROB MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH AMBER

759
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,106
ALL THE WAY TO THE END
AND SHE BEAT HIM.

760
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,108
THERE WAS ONE CRITICAL MOMENT
WHERE HE NEEDED HELP

761
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,902
FROM SOMEBODY
AND AFTER HE GOT HIS HELP,

762
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,612
HE CUT HIS THROAT.

763
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:55,116
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN
IS HE DIDN'T BETRAY AMBER.

764
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,119
IN FACT, HE HASN'T
BETRAYED HER SINCE.

765
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,078
>> THAT'S TRUE.

766
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,288
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FLIP SIDE
IF YOU HAVE

767
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,624
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH ROB
AND HE GIVES YOU HIS WORD,

768
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,877
HE COULD TAKE YOU ALL THE WAY.

769
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,005
>> Jeff: HARD TO DENY HISTORY.

770
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,424
YOU BETRAYED LEX,
BUT YOU STAYED TRUE

771
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,135
TO THE TRUE ALLIANCE WITH AMBER.

772
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,637
>> THE ONE I STILL HAVE
TO THIS DAY.

773
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,685
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

774
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,187
GRANT HAS THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

775
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,480
CANNOT VOTE FOR GRANT.

776
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,106
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

777
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,858
GRANT, YOU'RE UP.

778
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,654
>> LET'S DO IT!

779
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,782
LET'S DO IT.

780
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,731
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

781
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,033
IF ANYBODY HAS
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

782
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,410
AND YOU'D LIKE TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

783
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,208
ALL RIGHT.

784
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,918
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

785
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:29,752
PERSON VOTED OUT
WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE

786
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,546
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

787
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,463
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

788
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,426
FIRST VOTE, ROB.

789
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,847
ROB.

790
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,431
TWO VOTES ROB.

791
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,645
RALPH.

792
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,273
RALPH.

793
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,776
RALPH.

794
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,195
THAT'S THREE VOTES RALPH.

795
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,738
FOUR VOTE RALPH.

796
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,240
TWO VOTES ROB.

797
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,285
12th PERSON VOTED OUT.

798
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,079
RALPH. THAT'S FIVE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

799
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,039
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

800
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,467
RALPH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

801
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,306
>> SEE YOU, JEFF.

802
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,933
>> Jeff: NOT SO FAST.

803
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,935
GRAB YOUR TORCH.
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

804
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,312
YOU'RE STILL IN THIS GAME.

805
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,613
OKAY, NOW LET'S GET TO THE TWIST

806
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,615
I MENTIONED
AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

807
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,283
WHO HAS IT?

808
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,118
OPEN IT UP.

809
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:53,461
FLIP OVER THAT TOP CARD
AND READ THE BACK OF IT.

810
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,838
>> THIS COULD BE INTERESTING.

811
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,090
>> "YOU WILL NOW COMPETE IN YOUR

812
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,092
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

813
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,427
YOU WILL THEN
IMMEDIATELY VOTE OUT

814
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,680
ONE MORE TRIBE MEMBER."

815
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,822
>> "YOU WILL NOW COMPETE IN YOUR

816
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,616
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

817
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,993
YOU WILL THEN
IMMEDIATELY VOTE OUT

818
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,245
ONE MORE TRIBE MEMBER."

819
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,874
>> Jeff: STEVE, YOU CAN HOLD
ON TO THOSE CARS.

820
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,668
I'M GOING TO GIVE A STACK
OF CARDS TO EVERYBODY ELSE,

821
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,336
AND GRAB THE NECKLACE FROM YOU,
GRANT.

822
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,630
>> STEVE'S GOTTA WIN.

823
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,464
>> Jeff: TAKE A LOOK
THROUGH THOSE CARDS,

824
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,675
GET FAMILIAR WITH THEM.

825
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,550
>> THANK YOU.

826
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,725
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

827
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,310
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.

828
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,145
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU GUYS
A SERIES OF SYMBOLS.

829
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,855
YOU'RE GOING TO REPEAT THEM
BACK TO ME

830
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,815
USING THE SYMBOLS ON YOUR CARD.

831
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,567
EVERY TIME YOU GET IT RIGHT,
YOU STAY ALIVE.

832
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,403
IF YOU MISS ONE, YOU ARE OUT.

833
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,989
LAST PERSON LEFT
IN THIS CHALLENGE

834
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,865
WINS IMMUNITY,
IS SAFE AT THE VOTE

835
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,494
THAT WILL HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWING THIS CHALLENGE.

836
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,372
ALL RIGHT.

837
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,040
HERE WE GO.

838
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,396
ALL RIGHT.

839
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,858
SHOW ME THE FIRST SYMBOL
I SHOWED YOU.

840
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:42,570
EVERYBODY HAS THE CANTEEN.

841
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,571
THE CANTEEN IS RIGHT.

842
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,116
SHOW ME THE SECOND SYMBOL
I SHOWED YOU.

843
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,536
HOOK WAS THE SECOND SYMBOL.

844
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,871
EVERYBODY IS STILL ALIVE.

845
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,081
SHOW ME THE THIRD SYMBOL.

846
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,292
WHAT WAS THE THIRD SYMBOL
THAT I SHOWED YOU?

847
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,752
NATALIE IS NOT SURE.

848
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,544
EVERYBODY REVEAL.

849
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,546
EVERYBODY HAS THE POT.

850
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,424
EVERYBODY'S RIGHT.

851
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,634
NATALIE, YOU'RE STILL
NOT SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

852
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,887
THE FOURTH SYMBOL I SHOWED YOU.

853
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,723
STEVE, ROB, ANDREA, GRANT,

854
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,267
AND ASHLEY ALL HAVE FIRE.

855
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,769
PHILLIP HAS THE KNIFE.

856
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,270
NATALIE HAS THE MACHETE.

857
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:16,562
CORRECT ANSWER--

858
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,605
>> AAH!

859
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,647
>> Jeff: FIRE.

860
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,233
NATALIE IS OUT
AND PHILLIP IS OUT.

861
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,069
WE ARE DOWN TO FIVE.

862
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,779
WHAT'S THE NEXT SYMBOL
I SHOWED YOU?

863
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,448
STEVE SHOWS CANTEEN.

864
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,949
ASHLEY SHOWS CANTEEN.

865
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,618
ROB SHOWS CANTEEN.

866
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,620
GRANT AND ANDREA SHOW POT.

867
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,455
THE CORRECT SYMBOL WAS CANTEEN.

868
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,749
>> OH!

869
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,918
>> Jeff: GRANT AND ANDREA
ARE OUT OF IT.

870
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,796
WE ARE DOWN TO ASHLEY,

00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,134
HAVE DOMINATED THE GAME.

915
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,179
>> OMETEPE!

916
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,932

FORCED TO TURN ON EACH OTHER.

917
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,934
>> ONE OF US HAS TO GO
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
