1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:09,134
PREVIOUSLY ON "SURVIVOR," AT THE
HEALER TRIBE, JOE INTERROGATED

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,221
>> I PERSONALLY THINK YOU HAVE
THE IDOL.

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,264
>> I WISH I DID.

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,141
>> MIKE IS PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER
ONE.

5
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:20,478
>> AT THE HUSTLER TRIBE, PATRICK
FOUND HIS PARTNER IN CRIME.

6
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,479
>> I GOT YOUR BACK.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,231
>> I GOT YOU BACK IF YOU GOT
MINE.

8
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,818
>> Jeff: AND RYAN CONFESSED TO
HAVING THE SUPER IDOL.

9
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,947
>> IF WE DON'T GO TO TRIAL, I
HAVE TO GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,117
>> Jeff: THE HERO TRIBAL WAS
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND A

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,951
CORE FOUR CAME TOGETHER.

12
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,953
>> I WANTED US FOUR FROM THE
BEGINNING.

13
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,122
>> Jeff: WHICH PUT THE TWO
MOMS ON THE OUTS?

14
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,123
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S YOU BECAUSE
I THINK IT'S ME?

15
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,793
>> Jeff: BUT CHRISSY RECEIVED
RYAN'S SUPER IDOL.

16
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,629
>> IT CAN ONLY BE USED AT
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:51,593
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
ALAN ACCUSED J.P. AND ASHLEY OF

18
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,719
BEING A POWER COUPLE.

19
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,514
>> TO HAVE THE TERM "POWER
COUPLE" EVEN THROWN AROUND IS

20
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,474
RIDICULOUS.

21
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,476
>> I KNOW WHAT I KNOW, AND I'M
IN THE CRAZY.

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,810
I'M CONFIDENT.

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:08,651
>> Jeff: IN THE END, THE
ALLIANCE OF FOUR STUCK TOGETHER.

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,820
KATRINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

25
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:16,618
AND CHRISSY DECIDED NOT TO SAVE
KATRINA, HOLDING ON TO HER

26
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,161
SECRET BUT NOW POWERLESS IDOL.

27
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,204
17 ARE LEFT.

28
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:26,628
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

29
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:31,341
>> I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A WALK TO
THE WATERING HOLE.

30
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:35,178
>> I'LL GET WATER AT NIGHT
BEFORE I GO TO TRIBAL AGAIN.

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,013
LET'S NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.

32
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:37,639
>> THAT WAS BRUTAL.

33
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,766
>> I NEVER WANT TO GO AGAIN.

34
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,852
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS REALLY
HEATED AND ANGRY.

35
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,896
GREAT FOR ME, RIGHT?

36
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,398
I STARTED OUT ON THE BOTTOM.

37
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,652
NOW I THINK THAT I'M NO LONGER
ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE ALL THESE

38
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,321
OTHER CRACKS COME UP BECAUSE
PEOPLE DO IT TO THEMSELVES.

39
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,364
>> WOW.

40
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,698
GOOD JOB.

41
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,950
>> YEAH.

42
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:04,207
>> I WAS ALSO GLAD THAT I DID
NOT USE THE SUPER IMMUNITY ID.L.

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,876
-- IDOL, BECAUSE IN THE
FUTURE I CAN USE IT AS A DECOY.

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,962
IT HAS NO POWER, BUT IT STILL
HAS POWER.

45
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:15,760
>> I DON'T PLAN ON GOING BACK TO
THAT.

46
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
>> NOT AT ALL.

47
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,013
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS INTENSE.

48
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,393
I MEAN, I WAS NOT EXPECTING
FISTS TO START FLYING LIKE THAT.

49
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,312
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I
THINK I GOT WHAT I WANTED IN

50
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,775
TERMS OF PEOPLE REALLY THINKING
THAT ASHLEY AND J.P. ARE A POWER

51
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,444
COUPLE, SO MY PLAN WORKED
ESSENTIALLY, LIKE WHETHER I'M

52
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,866
RIGHT OR WHETHER I'M WRONG, I
THINK I CREATED SOME KIND OF

53
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,992
SUSPICION.

54
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:43,538
A LOT OF TIMES SUSPICION GETS
YOU THE RESULTS YOU WANT.

55
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,416
>> FIRST OF ALL, HOW DO YOU
CONVINCE PEOPLE OF SOMETHING

56
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,251
WHEN YOU HAVE IN PROOF?

57
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,878
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

58
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,589
I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU I
DON'T HAVE SOMETHING AND THAT ME

59
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,926
AND J.P. ARE NOT... AS SOON AS
THE WORD "POWER COUPLE" GOT

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,304
THROWN INTO IT, OH, MY GOSH,
THAT'S CRAZY.

61
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:03,099
THE WHOLE SPECTACLE THAT ALAN
CREATED TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

62
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,769
COUNCIL JUST KIND OF SHOWED
EVERYONE HOW OFF THE HINGES HE

63
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,021
REALLY IS.

64
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,273
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT BECOME AND
TELL MY WHOLE TRIBE THAT I'M IN

65
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,318
A POWER DUO WITH J.P. AND WE'RE
HIDING IDOLS.

66
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,447
I THINK HE WENT FROM A REALLY
SAFE PLACE WITH THE CORE FOUR TO

67
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,074
NOW PUTTING A HUGE TARGET ON HIS
BACK.

68
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,911
>>
DO YOU GUYS BELIEVE ME?

69
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,662
>> I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE YOU
MORE.

70
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,955
>> THANK YOU.

71
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,625
>> ALAN HAS TO KEEP IT UNDER
WRAPS PERIOD.

72
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,251
>> HE HAS.

73
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,630
TO I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
HE'S DOING.

74
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,464
>> THE GROUP IS LIKE OLD PAINT.

75
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,133
IT'S CRACKED AND FRACTURED
EVERYWHERE.

76
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,468
I'M NOT SURE WHO I CAN TRUST.

77
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,636
THE CORE FOUR IS GONE.

78
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,513
THE PERCEPTION MIGHT BE THERE IN
SOME PEOPLE'S HEADS, NOT

79
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,973
ACTUALLY, NO, IT'S NOT.

80
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,557
IT'S DONE.

81
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,475
THE WHOLE THING IS SHOT.

82
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,560
NOW IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:36,693
>> LOOK AT THAT, BABY.

84
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,404
>> OKAY.

85
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:43,241
>> WE HAVE DEFINITELY AS THE
DAYS HAVE GONE ON REALLY OWNED

86
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:43,700
THE HUSTLER MANTRA.

87
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784
I COBUST MY BUM.

88
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,246
THE HUSTLER TRIBE IS FEELING
REALLY GOOD ABOUT ITSELF.

89
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,539
WE HAVE SOME MOMENTUM NOW.

90
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,375
I THINK I'M IN A PRETTY GOOD
SPOT SOCIALLY.

91
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,377
I FEEL LIKE ME AND YOU ARE DOING
OKAY.

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,211
>> WE'RE DOING GOOD.

93
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,547
>> WE'RE DOING OKAY.

94
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,508
>> I THINK WE'RE THE BEST
PLAYERS IN OUR TRIBE.

95
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,718
>> FOR SURE.

96
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,554
>> EVERYONE ELSE, WHEN I TALK TO
THEM, I'M NOT SMILING WHEN I

97
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,057
I'M LIKE, OH, OKAY, I'M ALL
SERIOUS.

98
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,519
BUT WITH YOU I'M ABLE TO TALK
STRATEGY AND HAVE A SMILE ON MY

99
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,061
FACE.

100
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,896
>> I THINK WE'RE TIGHT.

101
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,897
WE'RE LOCK-STEP.

102
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,899
WE'VE GOTTEN ALONG SO WELL.

103
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,902
HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE I'VE
CONNECTED WITH EVERYBODY ON MY

104
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,406
TRIBE, MAYBE NAZI MOAN, BUT I
DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS A

105
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,074
CONNECTION WITH SIMONE.

106
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,995
SHE'S WEIRD, AND WEIRDNESS, YOU
WANT TO BLEND IN ON THESE FIRST

107
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:33,041
COUPLE DAYS, AND THE PEOPLE WHO
BLEND IN THE BEST ARE THE ONES

108
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:33,416
THAT ESCAPE.

109
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,127
>> I DID IT!

110
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:36,919
YES.

111
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,587
OH, MY GOD.

112
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,629
BUT IT WAS TERRIFYING.

113
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,257
I'M NOT AN OUTSIDE PERSON.

114
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,302
THE FACT THAT I WAS LEAVING
MYSELF IN THE WATER WAS THE

115
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,136
BIGGEST MILESTONE.

116
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,763
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT.

117
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,306
I FEEL LIKE A SUPER HERO.

118
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,098
>> AWESOME.

119
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,641
>> AND THAT'S YOUR SUPERPOWER.

120
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,476
>> YEAH.

121
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,895
I KNOW PEOPLE THINK THIS IS
PARADISE.

122
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,773
BUT IT'S TOUGH OUT HERE AND IT'S
HOT ALL THE TIME AND THERE IS NO

123
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,565
AIR CONDITIONING.

124
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,150
I HATE THE OUTSIDE.

125
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,278
>> YOU HATE THE OUTSIDE IN WE'RE
OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

126
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,446
>> WE'RE IN THE OUTSIDE.

127
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,989
>> I'M CHALLENGING MYSELF.

128
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,116
I'M HAVING AN ADVENTURE.

129
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,744
I'M TRYING TO TRY NEW THINGS.

130
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,288
I THINK PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AND
THINK HERE IS THIS PERSON WHO

131
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:16,125
HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN THE
OUTDOORS, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M A

132
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,752
HUSTLER BECAUSE I'M GOOD UNDER
PRESSURE.

133
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,629
>> SO WHO IS GOING TO GUT THE
FISH?

134
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,297
>> I'LL CLEAN THE FISH.

135
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,256
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.

136
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,924
>> YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE?

137
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,426
>> I READ UP ON HOW TO DO IT.

138
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,303
>> JUST DON'T CUT YOUR FINGER.

139
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:27,845
YOU GOT IT.

140
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,137
>> ALL RIGHT.

141
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,388
GET IT.

142
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,934
>> "SURVIVOR" MIGHT PUSH ME TO
MY LIMITS, BUT I'VE BEEN PLAYING

143
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,060
"SURVIVOR" MY ENTIRE LIFE.

144
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,311
I LIVE ON A TRIBE.

145
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,689
I HAVE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
SO I WAS FIGHTING CONSTANTLY TO

146
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,315
OUTPERFORM EVERYBODY.

147
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:39,690
>> NICE.

148
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,316
>> ALL RIGHT.

149
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,567
>> HEY, YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

150
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,446
>> I PLAN ON GAINING EVERYBODY'S
RESPECT BY JUST WORKING HARD,

151
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,114
BECAUSE THIS IS THE HUSTLER
TRIBE.

152
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:51,619
THIS IS THE WORK ETHIC TRIBE.

153
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,997
>> HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING,
SIMONE?

154
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,165
>> I'VE BEEN ADJUSTING.

155
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,834
>> GUTTING THAT FISH, THAT'S A
BIG DEAL.

156
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,502
I CAN TELL YOU'RE PUTTING
YOURSELF OUT THERE, YOU'RE

157
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,671
PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE TO DO
THINGS YOU NORMALLY WOULDN'T DO.

158
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,967
>>
THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT HANDLING

159
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,218
DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES.

160
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,720
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING I'M GOOD
AT, AND I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE

161
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,891
IS THINKING, OH, SIMONE IS THE
DIVA, I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH,

162
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,560
THAT BUT I SEE SIMONE'S VALUE AT
THIS TIME.

163
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:20,022
BEING HERE WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF
RANDOM PEOPLE IS A BIG STEP FOR

164
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,190
HER.

165
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,817
I DEFINITELY COULD USE THAT TO
MY ADVANTAGE AND KIND OF PULL

166
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,444
SIMONE ON TO MY SIDE.

167
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,655
YOU KEEP DOUBTING YOURSELF.

168
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,909
I THINK YOU NEED TO BE MORE
OPTIMISTIC IN HOW YOU THINK.

169
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,620
IF YOU THINK LESS OF YOU, OTHER
PEOPLE WILL THINK LESS.

170
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,373
YOU HAVE TO HYPE YOURSELF UP,
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, WHO ELSE

171
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,291
WILL?

172
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,209
I COULD SEE HER BEING LOYAL FOR
A LONG TIME.

173
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,836
I COULD DEFINITELY MOLD HER.

174
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,962
I'M HERE TO WIN.

175
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:48,050
SO I FEEL LIKE SIMONE, I COULD
USE AS PUTTY IN MY HANDS.

176
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,742
>> THIS IS THE WORST GAME OF CAT
AND MOUSE EVER.

177
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,576
>> YES.

178
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,245
>> IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING.

179
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,622
I KEEP SHOOTING AT THE SAME ONE.

180
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,581
>> IT WILL HAPPEN.

181
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,292
>> I FEEL SO DISAPPOINTED.

182
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:21,876
>> DON'T.

183
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,836
>> I WANT THE TRY AGAIN.

184
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,004
>> YEAH.

185
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,590
>> I THINK JESSICA IS SUPER
CUTE, ALTHOUGH SHE JUST TURNED

186
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:32,094
30, SO SHE PROBABLY SEES ME AS
SOME LITTLE KID AND DOESN'T EVEN

187
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,804
GIVE ME A SIDEWAYS LOOK, BUT
SHE'S A GREAT PERSON TO BE

188
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,472
AROUND.

189
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,099
I'M DIGGING THE ENERGY A LOT.

190
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,851
I THINK I MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE.

191
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,727
SOMETIMES I TALK TO THEM.

192
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,106
>> THAT'S SUPER CUTE.

193
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,149
WE DO FLIRT A LOT.

194
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,652
MAYBE IF I KEEP CATCHING HER
FISH, SHE'LL COME OVER.

195
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,819
SHE'S A COOL GIRL.

196
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,948
LIKE I COULD SEE MYSELF WITH
HER.

197
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,616
>> YOU WERE MISS VIRGINIA TWICE.

198
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,910
>> WHEN WERE YOU MISS VIRGINIA?

199
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,119
WHAT YEAR?

200
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:02,291
>> I WAS MISS VIRGINIA 2013 IN
THE AMERICAN SYSTEM AND 2014 IN

201
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,417
THE U.S.A. SYSTEM.

202
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,462
>> WE'RE ON THE WRONG TRIBE, AND
THERE'S A BEAUTY TRIBE.

203
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,713
WE THE UGLY ONES.

204
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,881
>> EVERYONE ON THIS TRIBE EXCEPT
ME IS HOT AND SMART.

205
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:13,594
>> YOU DEFINITELY HAVE THE
SMARTS, BRO, THE BEAUTY, YOU IS

206
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,971
ONE UGLY DUDE, BUT YOU'RE STILL
SMART.

207
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,763
>> THANKS.

208
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,681
>> I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

209
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,142
>> WE'RE DEFINITELY IN THE WRONG
TRIBE, MIKE.

210
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,020
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MIKE IS
HE'S STILL MY PUBLIC ENEMY

211
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,523
NUMBER ONE, BUT HE'S DEFINITELY
GROWING ON ME.

212
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,651
HE'S A LIKABLE GUY AND I KIND OF
LIKE HIM, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP

213
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,777
HIM AROUND.

214
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,321
SO I'M STILL FEEDING EVERYONE
THAT MIKE HAS THE IDOL.

215
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,992
I TRULY DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS THE
IDOL OR NOT, SO NOW IT'S KIND OF

216
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,703
ALMOST LIKE BACKFIRED ON ME
BECAUSE NOW I CAN'T LOOK FOR THE

217
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,455
IDOL AS MUCH AS I WANT THE LOOK
FOR THE IDOL.

218
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,499
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE WAYS TO
LEAVE CAMP.

219
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,834
>> ALL RIGHT.

220
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,419
ARE WE WELL,?

221
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,837
>> SEE YOU IN TEN, JOE.

222
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,754
>> COOL.

223
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,508
>> THE WINDOW IS A VERY, VERY
SMALL WINDOW.

224
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,719
BUT, YOU KNOW, I COULD
ACCOMPLISH A LOT OF THINGS IN A

225
00:09:54,802 --> 00:10:06,355
SMALL TIME.

226
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,066
>> I WONDER HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN
GONE.

227
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,193
>> A COUPLE HOURS.

228
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,498
>> WOW.

229
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,333
THERE IT IS.

230
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,876
IT'S A CLUE.

231
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:33,549
OCEAN, LOOKS LIKE A RAFT, FIVE
FEET, I FOUND A CLUE.

232
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,884
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A MAP TO THE
IDOL.

233
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,761
I THINK IT'S A RAFT.

234
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,762
IT LOOKS LIKE A RAFT.

235
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:42,391
WHEN I SEE IT, AUTOMATICALLY I
THINK OF COLE.

236
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,684
COLE HAS BEEN OUT THERE FISHING.

237
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,894
SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT
WITH HIM.

238
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,020
HOPEFULLY HE OPENS UP TO ME.

239
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,940
IF NOT HE'LL DEFINITELY TRUST ME
THAT I'M GIVING HIM SOME

240
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,692
INFORMATION.

241
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,902
>> I HAVEN'T REALLY EXPLORED.

242
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,652
>> RIGHT.

243
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,406
>> BUT I FOUND AN IDOL CLUE
TODAY.

244
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,032
>> REALLY?

245
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,700
>> IT'S MARKED ON A TREE.

246
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,285
SO IT'S IN THE A PHYSICAL CLUE.

247
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,915
IT'S A SQUARE, LIKE A RAFT, AND
IT SAID, OCEAN, FIVE FEET.

248
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,541
YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE SWIMMING
ALL DAY.

249
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,378
I JUST ASSUMED YOU HAD IT AND
DIDN'T TELL NOBODY, WHICH IS

250
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,003
COOL.

251
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,381
>> I HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT YET.

252
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,298
>> IT'S THERE.

253
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,925
>> WHERE IS THE CLUE?

254
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,886
>> IT'S ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK
WHERE THE ROCKS ARE.

255
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,932
>> JOE BROUGHT ME IN ON THE FACT
THERE'S A CLUE I CAN'T SEE.

256
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,141
I AM BESIDE MYSELF.

257
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,103
THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY EVER SO
FAR, AND THIS IS WHY I'M HERE

258
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,940
THE PLAY SURVIVOR IS TO FIND THE
ID.L. AND HAVE THE POWER, BUT

259
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,442
I'M SUSPICIOUS THAT THE IDOL IS
ON THE RAFT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

260
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,152
OUT FISHING ALL DAY.

261
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,657
SO I'M LIKE, DUDE, I NEED TO SEE
THIS CLUE.

262
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,909
>> THAT'S THE CLUE.

263
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,953
FIVE FEET, OCEAN, RAFT.

264
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,288
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,.

265
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,960
THAT'S THE SYMBOL FOR THE WELL
ON THE MAP.

266
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,671
THAT'S THE SYMBOL FOR THE WELL.

267
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,924
SO FIVE FEET FROM THE WELL, X
MARKS THE SPOT.

268
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,845
THAT'S THE SYMBOL FOR THE WELL.

269
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:05,516
DUDE, IT'S SECOND NATURE FOR ME
TO ENABLE PEOPLE AND HELP THEM

270
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,725
ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS.

271
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,977
THAT SKILL SET I FEEL LIKE IS
GIVING ME POWER IN THIS GAME.

272
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,440
SINCE JOE WOULD HAVE NEVER FOUND
THAT OUT BY HIMSELF, HE PROBABLY

273
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:21,699
SEES ME AS A REALLY GOOD
RESOURCE NOW.

274
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:27,163
>> SHOWING COLE THE CLUE WAS A
MAJOR RISK, BUT I NEEDED HELP.

275
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,541
LIKE I DON'T HONESTLY THINK I
WOULD HAVE FIGURED IT OUT ON MY

276
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,292
OWN.

277
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:37,214
>> IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

278
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,342
>> IN MY MIND IF ANYTHING POPS
OUT OF THAT GROUND, I'M

279
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:40,968
SNATCHING IT.

280
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,136
I WANT IT.

281
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,472
AND I'M GOING TO FIND IT TODAY.

282
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,181
>> GOT IT.

283
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:55,191
>> YEAH.

284
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,358
I GOT THE IDOL.

285
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,067
IT FEELS GOOD.

286
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,527
I FEEL GOOD.

287
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:04,158
>> THAT'S THE IDOL.

288
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,036
>> NOW I KNOW NO ONE ELSE HAS
IT, BUT I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE

289
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,998
THE FACT THAT COLE KNOWS I HAVE
THE IDOL CAN ABSOLUTELY

290
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,749
BACKFIRE.

291
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,833
IT'S ALL ABOUT POWER AND
KNOWLEDGE.

292
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,043
HE HAS TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE.

293
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,837
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO USE
IT AGAINST ME, BUT AT THE SAME

294
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,922
TIME, IF HE DOES, I MIGHT HAVE
TO PUT TARGET ON HIS BACK.

295
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,075
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING THINGS
DONE AND TAKING CARE OF

296
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,243
BUSINESS.

297
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,246
SO I'M OUT FISHING, TRYING TO
GET SOME BOARD, AND JUST ONE

298
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,372
STEP AT A TIME AND GO FROM
THERE.

299
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,249
>> HE'S WALKING UP WITH
SOMETHING.

300
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,084
I THINK THAT'S A LOBSTER.

301
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,752
>> NO WAY.

302
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,628
>> IT'S SOMETHING.

303
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,088
HE GOT SOMETHING.

304
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,425
>> I HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN
SUPER BIG ENTER DRAMA OR THE

305
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,094
CONFRONTATIONAL TYPE OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT, SO IF I CAN GET SOME

306
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,931
FISH, SOME LOBSTER, THINGS LIKE,
THAT MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAS A

307
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,810
FULL BELLY, I THINK EVERYONE
WILL BE HAPPY AND TAKEN CARE OF.

308
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,727
>> OH, MY GOSH.

309
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,603
>> NICELY DONE.

310
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,604
>> THAT IS MEAT.

311
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,064
>> THAT IS DELICIOUS.

312
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,901
>> THE OTHER NIGHT AT TRIBAL,
ASH AND I GOT CALLED OUT AS THE

313
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:21,610
POWER COUPLE.

314
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,820
THAT LABEL SUCKS.

315
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,447
I DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS A POWER
COUPLE AT ALL.

316
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,490
WE'RE NOT DATING.

317
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,408
WE'RE NOT HOOKING UP.

318
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,118
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT TYPE
OF STUFF.

319
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,122
IF WE'RE A POWER COUPLE, WE
MIGHT AS WELL HOOK UP AND BE A

320
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,081
COUPLE.

321
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,250
MIGHT AS WELL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
EVERYTHING.

322
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,462
SO ASH AND MY CONNECTION IS MORE
ON THE BACKBURNER NOW, BUT IN

323
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,924
THE FIRE HOUSE, THAT'S WHAT MY
PROFESSION IS, STAYING CALM IN

324
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,134
AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.

325
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,469
I MIGHT NOT BE THE GUY OUT THERE
TALKING STRATEGY TO EVERYBODY,

326
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:52,474
BUT I KNOW THAT I NEED TO CLEAN
MY REP UP A LITTLE WITH BIT AND

327
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,642
STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT.

328
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,145
>> OBVIOUSLY ASH AND I DON'T
HAVE AN IDOL AND OBVIOUSLY ASH

329
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,146
ANDRY NOT A COUPLE.

330
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,439
HOW IS EVERYTHING ELSE GOING?

331
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,148
>> GOOD.

332
00:14:59,231 --> 00:14:59,940
I'M FEELING GOOD.

333
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,150
>> GOOD.

334
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,695
>> I NEEDED TO GET THROUGH THAT
FIRST TRIBAL SO I COULD GET A

335
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,821
FOOTHOLD AND I GOT THROUGH IT.

336
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,532
NOW I REALLY THIS BELIEVE THAT I
CAN GO FAR IN THIS GAME.

337
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,994
I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO I
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH,

338
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,997
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU
NEED A STRONG PARTNER TO GET TO

339
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,956
THE END OF THE GAME.

340
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
>> WHAT ABOUT GAME?

341
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,168
>> LET'S PRETEND ME AND YOU.

342
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,377
>> YEAH.

343
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,506
>> PEOPLE WOULD NEVER SAY HE
WOULD GO WITH HER AND SHE WOULD

344
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,424
GO WITH HIM.

345
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,175
>> WE WOULDN'T GET LABELED A
POWER COUPLE.

346
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,344
>> THAT'S TRUE.

347
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,637
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

348
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,308
>> SO WHAT I DO AS AN ACTUARY IS
ANALYZE DATA AND FIGURE OUT WHAT

349
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,144
IS MY NEXT BEST MOVING GIVING
EVERYTHING I KNOW SOME HERE'S

350
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:42,066
WHAT I KNOW -- J.P. CAN BE
HELPFUL IN CHALLENGE, BUT

351
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,193
TRUTHFULLY I DON'T THINK HE'S
THAT SMART.

352
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,155
I THINK J.P. AND ALAN BOTH WANT
EACH OTHER OUT ALMOST.

353
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,990
>> YEAH, YEAH.

354
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,867
>> I'M WORRIED ALAN WANTS ME
OUT.

355
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,330
>> ASHLEY IS A VERY GOOD PLAYER,
BUT I DON'T ENTIRE TRUST ASHLEY.

356
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,416
I AM NOT CONVINCED THERE IS NOT
A POWER COUPLE.

357
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,542
>> WE'RE SOLID?

358
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,211
>> YEAH, WE'RE SOLID.

359
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,881
>> THEN AFTER ALAN HAD HIS
BLOW-UP, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

360
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,258
HAVING A TWOSOME WITH ALAN.

361
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,095
AT THIS POINT THE DATA SHOWS
THAT BEN IS A BETTER OPTION FOR

362
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,138
ME.

363
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:18,268
BEN HAS A LOT OF SOCIAL CHARM,
AND I CAN THINK SEVERAL STEPS

364
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:23,524
AHEAD STRATEGICALLY, SO TOGETHER
WE COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER VERY

365
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,901
WELL.

366
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:29,863
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS,
YOU, ME, AND ASHLEY, OR YOU,

367
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,073
MEN, AND ALAN.

368
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,408
LET ALAN THINK HE'S WITH US.

369
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,951
LET ASHLEY THINK SHE'S WITH US.

370
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:34,743
J.P. DOESN'T TALK TO ANYBODY.

371
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,203
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HECK HIS GAME
IS.

372
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,080
>> AS WE STAY TOGETHER.

373
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,248
>> YOU AND ME, YES.

374
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,459
>> THIS IS CRAZY HOW THIS IS
GOING.

375
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,419
>> TOTALLY CRAZY.

376
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,588
>> ALAN AND I WERE ALIGNED FROM
THE GET-GO.

377
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,132
BUT AFTER HE BLEW UP AT TRIBAL
THE OTHER NIGHT, I DON'T KNOW IF

378
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,467
I CAN WORK WITH HIM.

379
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,096
CHRISSY IS A SMART WOMAN, AND
SHE HAS A GOOD HEAD ON HER

380
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,097
SHOULDERS.

381
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,433
THAT'S GOING TO HELP ME GET
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

382
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,225
I'M IN.

383
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,435
LIKE THIS IS CRAZY.

384
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,103
WE'RE GOOD.

385
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,104
WE'RE SAFE.

386
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,731
>> WE CAN TOTALLY RIDE THIS OUT
THE ENTIRE WAY.

387
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,857
WE CAN RIDE IT OUT THE ENTIRE
WAY.

388
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,944
>> AT THIS POINT CHRISSY ANDRY
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, AND

389
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,406
WHATEVER WE DECIDE TO DO IS
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

390
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:12,823
SO LET'S DO THIS.

391
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,324
>> LET'S DO IT.

392
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,200
LET'S TOTALLY DO IT.

393
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,411
>> BUT NO MORE TALKING BETWEEN
YOU AND I.

394
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,455
>> NO, WE ARE NOT A POWER
COUPLE.

395
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:32,217
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

396
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,267
>> HUGE CRAB.

397
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,435
LOOK AT THAT!

398
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,646
THIS THING HAS CLAWS LIKE
ENORMOUS.

399
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,314
I GOT US A MEAL.

400
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,108
>> GEEZ, LOOK AT THOSE CLAWS.

401
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,985
GRAB IT, DUDE.

402
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:50,944
>> OW!

403
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:51,361
>> HAS HE GOT YOU?

404
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,113
>> ARE YOU HURT.

405
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,281
>> NO.

406
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,825
>> WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

407
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,329
>> WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

408
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,958
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ALIN
MY FACE.

409
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,335
>> THEY'RE SO SCARY.

410
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,503
I'M SCARED OF CRABS.

411
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,339
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY
CONTINUINGER MY FEAR BECAUSE I'M

412
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:15,219
A LOT BIGGER THAN THAT CRAB.

413
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:15,844
>> HE'S MOVING.

414
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,347
>> WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO.

415
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,348
>> HOLY GEEZ.

416
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,851
>> I'M A WILD BANSHEE.

417
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,269
I'M SOMEONE WHAT WANTS TO HAVE A
GOOD TIME ALL THE TIME.

418
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,689
MY STRATEGY IS TO KEEP EVERYONE
HAVING FUN.

419
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,651
WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT BEING THE

420
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:35,405
BULL'S-EYE.

421
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,242
>> DANCING SKILLS, WHAT WOULD
YOU SAY YOUR DANCING SKILLS ARE

422
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:38,534
LIKE?

423
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,744
>> ZERO.

424
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,246
>> YOU DO ANY PERFORMING AT
NIGHT?

425
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,206
WHAT ABOUT IN THE SHOWER?

426
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,417
>> NO, I MIGHT FALL AND BREAK MY
NECK.

427
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,505
>>
PATRICK IS STARTING TO GET

428
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,214
ON MY NERVES.

429
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,758
HE WANTS TO BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

430
00:18:54,842 --> 00:19:00,180
>> I'LL DO MY AUSTRALIAN ACCENT.

431
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,933
WANT TO PUT SOME SHRIMP ON THE
BARBIE.

432
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:03,350
WE'LL MINGLE.

433
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,268
>> SIT STILL.

434
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,894
HE'S TOO LOUD FOR ME.

435
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,645
HIS VOLUME IS AT A TEN.

436
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,940
HE NEEDS TO BE ABOUT A VOLUME
TWO.

437
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:10,899
HE IS A BIG KID.

438
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:16,572
HE'S A 25-YEAR-OLD BOY.

439
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,866
[FARTS]
YOU CAN LOOK HIM DEAD IN THE

440
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,869
FACE AND SAY, PATRICK, DO NOT
TOUCH, THAT AN HE WILL LOOK AT

441
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,413
YOU AND TOUCH IT.

442
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,915
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE REALLY?

443
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,501
I CAN'T JUST COME OUT AND SAY,
SHUT THE HELL UP, JUST BECAUSE I

444
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,421
AM OLDER, I THINK THEY WOULD
WANT TO STICK TOGETHER.

445
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,590
IT'S VERY TOUGH FOR ME.

446
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,258
I'M IN THE A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY.

447
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:41,388
TO BE A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN,
YOU WORK ALONE.

448
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,267
I DON'T WANT TO BE EXPLOITED, SO
I'M TRYING TO BUILD A

449
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,437
RELATIONSHIP WITH ALI, TRYING TO
GET ON THE SAME PAGE WITH HER.

450
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,481
I JUST WANT TO SEE THAT YOU
ANDRY ON THE SAME PAGE, YOU KNOW

451
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,691
WHAT I MEAN?

452
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:58,488
THE MORE YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
PATRICK'S GOING TO START WEARING

453
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,574
ON US AFTER A WHILE.

454
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,408
IT'S HARD TO NOT GET SHORT WITH
HIM.

455
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,452
>> YEAH, IT DEFINITELY IS.

456
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,328
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

457
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,456
>> PATRICK'S NAME IS STARTING TO
COME UP.

458
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,707
IT'S SO EARLY.

459
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,085
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO COME UP IF
PATRICK IS GETTING ON PEOPLE'S

460
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,003
NERVES AND HE'S NUTS.

461
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,464
>> HE'S JUST SO ADAMANT ON
EVERYTHING.

462
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,634
>> YEAH.

463
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,345
WITH PATRICK, I FEEL LIKE I'M
BABYSITTING A LOT.

464
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,472
I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE MY JOB.

465
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,307
I'M HERE TO PLAY FOR ME, NOT
ANYBODY ELSE.

466
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,517
I THINK I HAVE TO DEFINITELY
THINK ABOUT WHERE WE STAND AND

467
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,480
HOW IMPORTANT THIS RELATIONSHIP
IS, BECAUSE IF PEOPLE DECIDE TO

468
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,358
VOTE PATRICK OUT, I DON'T THINK
I NEED HIM IN THIS GAME ANYMORE.

469
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,676
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

470
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,511
HEALERS AND HUSTLERS GETTING
YOUR FIRST LOOK AT THE HERO

471
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,428
TRIBE.

472
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,014
KATRINA VOTED OUT AT FIRST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

473
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,142
>> CHRISSY DOES NOT KNOW I'M THE
ONE THAT GAVE THAT TO HER.

474
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,852
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT FIRST
TRIBAL WENT.

475
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,397
MAYBE SHE USED IT AND THAT'S WHY
SHE'S STILL THERE, BUT I HOPE

476
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,817
SHE STICKS AROUND SO I CAN GET
AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THAT

477
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,736
CONNECTION DOWN THE ROAD.

478
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,821
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

479
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,824
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

480
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,992
>> YEAH.

481
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:32,708
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST, I
NEED TO TAKE BACK THE IDOLS.

482
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,542
THANK YOU.

483
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,546
THANKS, MIKE.

484
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,258
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

485
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,551
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, THREE
MEMBERS OF EACH TRIBE ARE GOING

486
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,387

ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTEDDED ALL

FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

493
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,576
IN ADDITION, YOU'RE PLAYING FOR
REWARD.

494
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,536
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

495
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,871
>> YES.

496
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,416
>> Jeff: FIRST TRIBE THE
FINISH, THE ULTIMATE "SURVIVOR"

497

FISHING KIT.

498

>> ALL RIGHT.

499
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,586
>> Jeff: YOU'VE BEEN CATCHING
FISH, THIS WILL TAKE IT TO THE

500
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,588
NEXT LEVEL.

00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:29,890
LURES.

LAST TRIBE TO FINISH, NOTHING
BUT A DATE WITH ME AT TRIBAL

505
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,063
COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE
THE SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF

506
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,522
THIS GAME.

507
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,107
HEALERS, YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA
MEMBER.

508
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,275
GOING TO SIT SOMEBODY OUT?

509
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:40,609
WHO IS IT GOING TO BE?

510
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,611
>> JOE.

511

00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,468
EVERYONE NOW WORKING ON THEIR
SIGNPOST PUZZLE.

578
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,472
THE GOAL IS YOU WANT TO SPIN
THAT SO IT DOESN'T HIT ANY OF

579
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,307
THE OBSTACLES.

580
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,974

YOU'RE GOOD.

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,861
>> OKAY, WHICH IS THE
SHORTEDDEST?

587
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,988
>> Jeff: HEALERS, THAT WON'T
WORK.

588
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,864
YOU WILL HAVE TO SWAP OUT.

589
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,199
THERE'S A LOT OF TRIAL AND
ERROR.

590
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,743
IF IT WERE EASY, IT WOULD NOT BE
"SURVIVOR."

591
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,537
>> OKAY.

592
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,371

HEROES STILL TRYING NEW
COMBINATIONS.

00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:09,878
THEY THINK THEY'RE CLOSE.

597
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,381
HEALERS WITH ONE PIECE LEFT.

598
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,383
HUSTLERS WITH ONE PIECE LEFT.

599
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,763
THE QUESTION IS WHERE DOES IT GO
>> RIGHT THERE, PUT THAT THERE.

600
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,766
>> Jeff: SIMONE AND ALI HOPE
THEY HAVE IT.

601
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,475
NO, SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT.

602
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,852
>> NOT THERE, NOT THERE, SIMONE.

603
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,062
>> OKAY.

604
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,813
>> Jeff: SIMONE AND ALI HAVE
HAD A HUGE HEAD START, BUT IT'S

605
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,273
EVAPORATED NOW.

606
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,191
WE'RE DEAD EVEN.

607
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,736
ANYBODY CAN STILL PULL THIS OUT.

608
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,404
>> DESI, DESI.

609
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,989
BEHIND YOU!

610
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,076
>> Jeff: HUSTLERS STILL
WORKING WITH THEIR LAST PIECE.

611
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,994
NO, ANOTHER BLOCK.

612
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:43,953
SOMETHING STILL NOT RIGHT.

613
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,374
>> FIND WHICH PIECES NEED TO GO
WHERE, SIMONE.

614
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,459
>> CAMBODIA.

615
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,460
CAMBODIA.

616
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:50,960
>> Jeff: HEALERS NOW GETTING
SOME MOMENTUM AGAIN.

617
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,961
IF THEY'RE RIGHT...

00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,922
>> KEEP SPINNING.

619
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,924
>> Jeff: HEALERS THINK THEY
HAVE IT.

620
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,593
>> JEFF!

621
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,636
>> Jeff: THEY DO.

622
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:04,766
HEALERS WIN IMMUNITY FOR THE
SECOND TIME IN A ROW.

623
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,767
>> LET'S GO, BABY.

624
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,311
>> Jeff: WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE
MORE.

625
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,938
>> GO TO GO BACK.

626
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,607
IT IS NOW THE HEROES VERSUS THE
HUSTLERS.

627
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,775
>> OKAY.

628
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,317
ANYONE?

629
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,276
WHICH ONE, WHICH ONE?

630
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,779
>> Jeff: ALL THE PRESSURE ON
ALI AND SIMONE.

631
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,905
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT IF YOU'RE ON
THE PUZZLE.

632
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,282
>> PUT THAT PIECE BACK.

633
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:21,991
YEAH.

634
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,618
>> NO, IT'S WAY TOO SMALL, GUYS.

635
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,536
>> TRY IT.

636
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,997
>> Jeff: PATRICK YELLING OUT
ORDERS TO ALI.

637
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:28,957
>> TOO LONG.

638
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,833
>> Jeff: IT'S WRONG.

639
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,126
ANOTHER BLOCK.

640
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,961
>> GET DOWN, SIMONE.

641
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,964
>> YOU JUST OBSERVE, SIMONE.

642
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:42,178
>> Jeff: HEROES TRYING A NEW
SERIES OF PIECES.

643
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:42,804
>> YEAH!

644
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,639
>> Jeff: AND THEY'VE GOT IT.

645
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:46,975
HEROES WIN IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SENDING THE HUSTLERS TO TRIBAL

646
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:57,026
COUNCIL.

647
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,320
HEALER TRIBE, WHO WANTS TO COME
GET IT?

648
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,991
>> THERE WE GO, COLE.

649
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,451
>> Jeff: NICE JOB.

650
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,328
NOBODY GOING HOME ONCE AGAIN
FROM THE HEALER TRIBE.

651
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,166
AND A BIG FISHING REWARD WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

652
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,793
>> YAY!

653
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,753
>> Jeff: HERO TRIBE, SOMEBODY
COME GET IT.

654
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,087
>> YEAH.

655
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,630
I'M ON IT.

656
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,843
I'M ON IT.

657
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,179
>> Jeff: NICE JOB, HERO TRIBE.

658
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,430
NOBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

659
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,808
AND A SMALLER BUT STILL USEFUL
FISHING KIT WILL BE WAITING FOR

660
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,853
YOU BACK AT CAMP.

661
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,104
HUSTLERS, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

662
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,565
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY
WILL BE THE SECOND PERSON VOTED

663
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,983
OUT OF "SURVIVOR."

664
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,860
HEAD BACK TO CAMP, SWIM ON OUT.

665
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:45,366
>> IN MY MIND, SIMONE IS OUR
LEAST-VALUABLE MEMBER.

666
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,285
SHE DOESN'T FIT IN WITH ALL OF
US.

667
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,496
WE SAW TODAY SHE CAN'T DO
PUZZLES.

668
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,581
IT'S A BUMMER, BY SIMONE'S GOT
TO GO.

669
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,400
>> WE PLAYED HARD.

670
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,610
>> OH, MAN.

671
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,905
>> I CAN JUST SAY, I'M REALLY
SORRY, LIKE WE HAD A LEAD AND I

672
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,199
WISH I HAD BEEN MORE DOMINANT IN
THE PUZZLE.

673
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,077
WE ALL WANTED IT SO MUCH, LIKE
IT'S THE WORST THING THAT COULD

674
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,081
HAVE HAPPENED.

675
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,917
AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
CONNECTING WITH EVERYBODY,

676
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,754
BONDING WITH EVERYBODY, AND TO
HAVE TO REMOVE ONE OF US, IT

677
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,422
JUST MAKES ME FEEL SICK.

678
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,467
>> AS FAR AS CHALLENGES, IT
OBVIOUSLY STANDS OUT THAT I'M

679
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,095
NOT ONE OF THE STRONGEST PEOPLE
HERE, SO I THINK I WOULD BE AN

680
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:51,099
SO WHAT I NEED TO DO IS START
SHAPING THE NARRATIVE OF THE

681
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,267
TRIBE.

682
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,186
CLEARLY PATRICK IS GETTING ON
LAUREN'S NERVES, AND THAT'S

683
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,523
GOING TO PLAY TO MY ADVANTAGE.

684
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,942
IT IS VERY EASY FOR PEOPLE TO
HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT PATRICK,

685
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:08,283
WHICH MAKES IT VERY EASY TO
SHAPE THE NARRATIVE AROUND HIM.

686
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,452
HONESTLY I DON'T WANT TO OUT
PAT, BUT I NOTICE YOU AND

687
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,121
PATRICK ARE BUTTING HEADS.

688
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,248
I KNOW IT SUCKS TO TALK ABOUT...

689
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,125
>> PATRICK IS EARNING MY NERVES.

690
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,753
HE'S ONLY ENERGETIC WHEN IT'S
SOMETHING CONCERNING HIM.

691
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,921
>> I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

692
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,631
>> SO YOU MUST WORRY ABOUT HIM.

693
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,799
>> RIGHT.

694
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:27,969
WE COULD PROBABLY CONVINCE MAYBE
EITHER RYAN OR DEVON TO VOTE

695
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:28,636
WITH US.

696
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,471
>> PATRICK IS UNPREDICTABLE.

697
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,600
I DON'T TRUST HIM, AND HE
DOESN'T FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.

698
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,851
SO HE COULD HURT US.

699
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,186
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH HE'S
STRONG, STRONG ISN'T ALWAYS WHAT

700
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,354
YOU NEED.

701
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:42,650
SIMONE'S NOT THAT GREAT AT
CHALLENGES, BUT SIMONE AT LEAST

702
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,943
LISTENS.

703
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,530
WE GOT TO GET BACK OVER THERE SO
THEY DON'T TRIP OUT.

704
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:47,947
SO PATRICK.

705
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,698
>> ALL RIGHT.

706
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,617
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE OF
US.

707
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:50,992
>> I HOPE NOT.

708
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,994
>> IT'S NOT.

709
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:53,328
IT'S SIMONE.

710
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,038
>> YEAH.

711
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,247
EXACTLY.

712
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,333
>> TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
SIMONE IS GOING TO BE THE ONE

713
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,375
GOING HOME.

714
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,795
I HAVE NOT SEEN HER IN ANY WAY
HELPING US AS A TRIBE.

715
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,506
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IS
ON THE SAME PAGE WITH ME.

716
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,676
THE BOYS ARE ALREADY TOGETHER,
AND ALI'S ON MY SIDE, SO I'VE

717
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,719
GOT A MAJORITY HERE.

718
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,138
I THINK THIS TRIBE WILL BE
DEFINITELY BETTER WITHOUT

719
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,182
SIMONE.

720
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,059
>> SIMONE'S THE FIRST ONE.

721
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:16,684
>> YEAH.

722
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,852
>> I HOPE THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

723
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,020
>> NO, YEAH.

724
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,146
OF COURSE.

725
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,106
I'D RATHER BE ON THE MAJORITY,
RIGHT?

726
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,733
>> YEAH.

727
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,734
WE'RE ON THE MAJORITY.

728
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,320
>> GOING INTO TONIGHT, I
DEFINITELY HAVE OPTIONS.

729
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,657
YOU KNOW, I KNOW SIMONE WILL
LISTEN TO ME AND I KNOW SHE

730
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,159
WOULD FOLLOW ME, BUT ME AND PAT
HAVE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE DAY

731
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,327
ONE.

732
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,704
HE LOOKS AT ME AND I CAN TELL
THAT HE TRUSTS ME MORE THAN

733
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,830
ANYONE ELSE IN THIS GAME.

734
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,999
>> I'M EXCITED GOING FOR IT.

735
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,167
>> ME TOO.

736
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,544
>> MY ONLY CONCERN IS PEOPLE
AREN'T SURE ABOUT PATRICK FOR

737
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,545
THE LONG HAUL.

738
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,048
I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS HE'S WAY
TOO UNPREDICTABLE.

739
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,466
THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING
TO DO.

740
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,178
>> SO GUN TO MY HEAD RIGHT NOW
I'D PROBABLY SAY SIMONE.

741
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,390
>> YEAH, BUT SHE SAID PAT'S
NAME.

742
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,724
>> OH, MY GOD.

743
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,310
IF WE VOTE OUT PAT, WE'LL
PROBABLY LOSE EVERY SINGLE TIME.

744
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:05,733
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE
WE HAVE SIMONE EATING OUT OF OUR

745
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,359
HANDS.

746
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,443
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

747
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,696
>> DO WE KEEP HER AROUND BECAUSE
SHE'S SOMEONE THAT...

748
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,739
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

749
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,074
>> IS EASY TO CONTROL?

750
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,201
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.

751
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,911
BECAUSE PAT IS UNPREDICTABLE.

752
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,162
>> I KNOW.

753
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,332
SO IF WE HAVE THE THREE, WITH
ME, YOU AND DEVON, WE'RE GOLDEN.

754
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,211
>> WE COULD EASILY SURVIVE.

755
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,046
IF WE HAVE US THREE, THAT'S ALL
WE NEED.

756
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:27,755
>> YEAH.

757
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,382
>> BECAUSE THREE IS A MAJORITY.

758
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:34,721
>> INITIALLY I KIND OF WANTED
SIMONE OUT, BUT IT'S A LOT OF

759
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,723
UNCERTAINTY WITH PATRICK.

760
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,726
IT'S LIKE YOU GOT A NEWBORN
BABY, LIKE YOU REALLY WANT THE

761
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,396
LIKE IT, TAKE CARE OF IT, BUT
IT'S REALLY, REALLY ANNOYING

762
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,566
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT
EVERY SINGLE SECOND.

763
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,736
HE'S REALLY GOOD AROUND CAMP AND
HE'S GREAT IN CHALLENGE, AS

764
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,155
WELL, BUT HE'S UNPREDICTABILITY,
AND PREDICTABILITY IS THE BEST

765
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,282
THING I CAN HAVE IN AN ALLIANCE
MEMBER.

766
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,076
THAT'S WHY I LIKE DEVON SO MUCH.

767
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,456
>> AS LONG AS WE GET OUT OF THIS
HELLHOLE, PERFECT.

768
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,540
>> YEAH.

769
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,251
>> BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
DRAGGING ALONG A ELEMENTING IN

770
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,586
SIMONE.

771
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,754
SHE SCARES ME.

772
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,129
SHE'S REALLY SMART.

773
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,130
>> WE'RE GOOD?

774
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,341
>> WE'RE GOOD.

775
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,468
>> FOR SURE.

776
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,929
>> I WANT TO BE ALIGNED WITH
PREDICTABLE PEOPLE WHO ARE

777
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,306
SOCIALLY GOOD AND WANT TO LISTEN
TO ME.

778
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,100
TONIGHT IS ABOUT WHO CAN WE
TRUST MORE GOING FORWARD, AND

779
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,644
WHO IS GOING TO BE THE MOST
LOYAL?

780
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,314
IT'S REALLY SCARY, BUT YOU GOT
TO PUT YOUR TRUST IN PEOPLE IN

781
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,941
THIS GAME BECAUSE IN A
SIX-PERSON TRIBE, THERE IS NO

782
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:34,739
PLACE TO HIDE.

783
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,221
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
A TORCH.

784
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:03,309
GO AHEAD, GRAB A TORCH, APPROACH
A FLAME, DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

785
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,354
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS

786
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,524
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

787
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,193
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

788
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,361
ALL RIGHT.

789
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,989
RYAN, SIX DAYS IN, WHAT'S THE
VIBE OF THE HUSTLER TRIBE?

790
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,200
>> OBVIOUSLY WE'RE SAD THAT WE
LOST TODAY.

791
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,368
IT WAS A TOUGH CHALLENGE.

792
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,163
BUT WE'VE BEEN IN IT A LOT OF
THE TIME, AND WE'VE BONDED SO

793
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,373
WELL TOGETHER.

794
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,583
I FEEL LIKE IT'S A BIRTHDAY
PARTY THAT YOUR MOM MAKES YOU GO

795
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,920
TO, AND YOU DON'T LIKE THE KID
WHOSE BIRTHDAY PARTY IT, IS AND

796
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,547
WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO IT.

797
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,549
WE ALL LOVE EACH OTHER.

798
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,384
>> Jeff: OH, TRIBAL IS THE
BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR THE KID YOU

799
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,677
DON'T LIKE.

800
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,472
>> BUT I WANT THE KEEP EVERYBODY
THAT'S GOING TO THE PARTY, BUT I

801
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,558
DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.

802
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,392
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jeff: LAUREN, THAT'S A

803
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,519
REALLY INTERESTING OBSERVATION.

804
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,896
>> FOR ME IT'S NOT A BIRTHDAY
PARTY.

805
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,523
IT'S MORE LIKE A FUNERAL.

806
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,399
HUSTLERS USUALLY WORK ALONE.

807
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,568
WE'RE THE ODDEST GROUP OF
PEOPLE.

808
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,071
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A
PROBLEM COMING IN AND HANGING

809
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,574
OUT, BUT WE ARE CAPABLE OF
WORKING TOGETHER IF THERE IS

810
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,618
ENOUGH COMMUNICATION, SO I HOPE
IT CONTINUES TO WORK AND I HOPE

811
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,913
WE DON'T GET SEEN FOR A LONG
TIME AFTER TONIGHT.

812
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,583
>> Jeff: ALI, I'M GETTING A
SENSE FROM THIS GROUP THAT

813
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,877
HARMONY IS WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE
YOU REALLY GEL.

814
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,587
SO DOES THAT MAKE TONIGHT'S VOTE
DIFFICULT?

815
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,838
>> YEAH.

816
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,298
NOT ONLY THINKING AS A TRIBE,
BUT THINKING PERSONALLY, I HAVE

817
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:19,260
THE THINK, HOW IS THIS PERSON
THAT EITHER GOES OR STAYS GOING

818
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,722
TO BENEFIT ME AND MY TRIBE.

819
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,432
THIS GAME CHANGES SO RAPIDLY,
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE YOU

820
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,060
CAN TRUST AND PEOPLE THAT ARE ON
YOUR SIDE THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN

821
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,062
GO TO THEM, YOU KNOW, WHEN
NECESSARY.

822
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,441
>> Jeff: PATRICK, ALI MAKES A
REALLY GOOD POINT.

823
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,402
EVERY PERSON YOU VOTE OUT
IMPACTS THE TRIBE, BUT THEY ALSO

824
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,486
IMPACT YOUR GAME.

825
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,783
>> YES, WE'VE COME TO THIS SAD
BIRTHDAY PARTY, AND IT'S

826
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,452
DEFINITELY IMPACTING THE WAY I
WANT TO VOTE AND WHO I AM GOING

827
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,578
TO VOTE OUT.

828
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,290
I WANT TO KEEP OUR TRIBE THE
STRONGEST AND KEEP OUR TRIBE

829
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,416
MOVING FORWARD AT ITS BEST PACE.

830
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,295
>> Jeff: RYAN, EVERY VOTE
MATTERS, NOT ONLY IN HARMONY,

831
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,672
BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF STRATEGY.

832
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,759
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HERE IS
ALREADY LOOKING DOWN THE LINE.

833
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,803
>> FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE A LOT
OF FACETS.

834
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,140
YOU CAN FOCUS ON PHYSICALITY,
SHORT TERM WIN THE CHALLENGES.

835
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,435
YOU CAN SAY, WE NEED TO FOCUS ON
SOCIAL DYNAMICS AND TRY THE

836
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,978
BUILD TRUST INTO SOMETHING
STRATEGIC.

837
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,814
THERE ARE SICK DIFFERENT AGENDAS
UP HERE, BUT EVERYBODY THINKS

838
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,982
THERE IS JUST ONE PLAN.

839
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,486
>> Jeff: SIMONE, WHAT WILL THE
VOTE BE BASED ON FOR YOU?

840
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,865
>> IF WE WERE PLAYING OLE-SCHOOL
SURVIVOR, IT IS ALWAYS HOW DID

841
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,826
THE CHALLENGE GO, BUT I THINK IT
HAS MORE TO GO WITH BUILDING UP

842
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,621
A BODY OF PEOPLE YOU TRUST AND
UNDERSTANDING YOUR RELATIONSHIP

843
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,708
WITH THEM AND BUILDING A SOLID
FOUNDATION SO YOU CAN MOVE

844
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,876
TOGETHER.

845
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,379
>> Jeff: ALI, THOSE ARE THE
KIND OF WORDS SAID BY SOMEBODY

846
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,382
THAT IF THEY'RE TRUE COULD BE AN
ALLIANCE PARTNER THAT GOES DEEP.

847
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,841
>> YEAH, I THINK SO.

848
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,844
I MEAN, ONCE WE VOTE, WE'RE
GOING TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHERE

849
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,096
WE STAND.

850
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,515
SO STRATEGICALLY SOMEONE LIKE
THIS THAT WANTS TO STAY TIGHT IS

851
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,142
GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL, OF
COURSE.

852
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,853
>> Jeff: PATRICK, HOW
IMPORTANT IS TRUST TO YOU RIGHT

853
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,854
NOW IN THIS GROUP?

854
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,898
>> HAVING TRUST IS HUGE.

855
00:37:55,982 --> 00:38:04,865
AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN TRUST MOST
OF THE PEOPLE HERE.

856
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,366
>> Jeff: MOST.

857
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,534
HE DIDN'T SAY ALL.

858
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,702
>> HE DID NOT.

859
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,121
>> SORRY, JEFF, I MEANT TO SAY
ALL.

860
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:10,871
>> Jeff: WOW.

861
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,999
THAT GOT A BIG REACTION,
PATRICK.

862
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,208
>> IT DID.

863
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,543
IT WAS A SLIP OF WORDS.

864
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,503
I'M TALKING TOO FAST.

865
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,504
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE COME OUT.

866
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:23,467
I'M GOING TO SAY I TRUST ALL OF
OUR MEMBERS.

867
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,844
>> I'M SOLD.

868
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,388
>> YEAH, ME TOO.

869
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,349
>> THAT'S IT.

870
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,561
>> Jeff: LAUREN, WHILE PATRICK
JOKES, THE TRUTH IS WHAT COMES

871
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,563
OUT OUT HERE IS USUALLY A LOT
MORE AUTHENTIC.

872
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,565
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.

873
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,441
THIS IS VERY REAL.

874
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,526
I MEAN, IF YOU MEAN ALL, SAY
ALL.

875
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,111
IF YOU MEAN MOST, SAY MOST.

876
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,362
THIS IS A GAME.

877
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,573
>> Jeff: PATRICK, IF I CAN PUT
A HEART MONITOR ON YOU, HOW MANY

878
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,407
BEATS PER MINUTE RIGHT NOW?

879
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,367
>> A LOT.

880
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,953
I WOULD GUESS ABOUT 180.

881
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:55,041
I THINK THAT'S WAY FASTER THAN
NORMAL.

882
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,251
JEFF, YOU KNOW, I AM NERVOUS
RIGHT NOW.

883
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,004
IT MAKES MY STOMACH
UNCOMFORTABLE THINKING THAT

884
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,757
ANYBODY COULD WANT TO VOTE HOME
THE ONLY REDHEAD ON THE TIME.

885
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,425
>> Jeff: AND YET, IT'S
POSSIBLE.

886
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:09,305
>> JEFF, I WOULD SAY I'M ONE OF
THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE YOU

887
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,181
CAN KNOW.

888
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,098
THE LAST THING I WANT IS ME
GOING HOME.

889
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,309
I WANT TO BE HERE ON THE LAST
DAY WITH YOU.

890
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,436
>> Jeff: HOW MANY OF YOU WERE
LISTENING TO THAT ANSWER

891
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,064
THINKING, OH, GOD, I HOPE IT'S
NOT ME TONIGHT, BECAUSE THAT'S

892
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:18,439
HOW I FEEL?

893
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:18,939
>> YEAH.

894
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,899
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY.

895
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:20,941
>> BIG TIME.

896
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,277
>> DREW: RYAN, IF IT'S YOU
TONIGHT, SIX DAY, IS THAT

897
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,028
ENOUGH?

898
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,614
>> EVERYBODY LEAVES SO MUCH
HERE.

899
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,951
I'D BE GUTTED IF I WENT HOME
EARLY, BECAUSE YOUR STORY IS

900
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:35,623
JUST CHOPPED, AND YOU ONLY HAVE
SUCH A SHORT TIME PERIOD TO LOOK

901
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,627
BACK FONDLY UPON WHEN YOU KNOW
THAT THE GAME CONTINUED WITHOUT

902
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,628
YOU.

903
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,296
>> Jeff: SIMONE, IF IT'S YOU,
NOT WHAT YOU WANT?

904
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:45,174
>> I AGREE.

905
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,926
THIS IS 100% REAL.

906
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,177
THIS STRUGGLE IS SO DIFFERENT.

907
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,886
I COME FROM A CITY.

908
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,930
I'VE NEVER BEEN CAMPING BEFORE.

909
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,641
I'M TERRIFIED 100% OF THE TIME.

910
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,311
BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT BEING A
HUSTLER IS YOU CHALLENGE

911
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:58,145
YOURSELF.

912
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:58,687
SO SEND ME BACK TO THE BUGS.

913
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:04,527
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

914
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,861
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

915
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,029
TIME TO VOTE.

916
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,156
SIMONE, YOU'RE UP.

917
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:43,691
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

918
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,820
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

919
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,740
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

920
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,700
OKAY.

921
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,951
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

922
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,705
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

923
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,205
IMMEDIATELY.

924
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:58,706
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

925
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:04,003
FIRST VOTE PATRICK.

926
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,214
SIMONE.

927
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:07,673
SIMONE.

928
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,510
TWO VOTES SIMONE.

929
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,011
SIMONE.

930
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:12,845
THREE VOTES SIMONE.

931
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:17,016
ONE VOTE PATRICK.

932
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,684
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR," SIMONE.

933
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,396
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

934
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,857
>> OKAY.

935
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,149
I KNOW.

936
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:34,200
I KNOW.

937
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,703
>> Jeff: SIMONE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

938
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,413
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

939
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:47,004
>> BYE.

940
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,424
>> Jeff: WELL, THE BAD NEWS IS
YOU LOST A TRIBE MEMBER.

941
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,593
THE GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'RE THE
HUSTLER TRIBE.

942
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,595
WHEN YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, YOU
GET BACK UP.

943
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,054
THE GAME IS EARLY.

944
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,847
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

945
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,098
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

946
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,392
GOOD NIGHT.

947
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,900
