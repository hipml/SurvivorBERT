00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,085
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:02,377
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,003
>> We need to talk.

4
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,005
>> PROBST: At La Mina...

5
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,298
...Dan brought Ruth Marie into

6
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,301
the men's alliance, and Sally

7
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,886
knew she was in trouble.

8
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,012
>> All I can do right now is

9
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,639
keep working hard and prove

10
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,640
myself valuable.

11
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,307
>> PROBST: At the Reward

12
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,392
Challenge...

13
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,226
Want to know what you're playing

14
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:18,393
for?

15
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,978
>> Yeah.

16
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:20,645
>> PROBST: ...the tribes played

17
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,563
for a fully stocked bathroom.

18
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,814
>> Oh, yeah!

19
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,857
>> PROBST: Go!

20
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,983
Reward at stake.

21
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,234
Losers sending somebody to Exile

22
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,361
Island.

23
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,195
Casaya wins rewards.

24
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,321
(cheering and whooping)

25
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,531
Shane, who's it going to be?

26
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,490
>> Terry.

27
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,491
>> PROBST: And Terry was

28
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,828
banished to Exile Island.

29
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,454
When Casaya returned to camp...

30
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,497
>> Beautiful!

31
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,331
>> PROBST: ...there was some

32
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,249
conflict over how to use their

33
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,167
reward.

34
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,126
>> My vote is to use the

35
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:43,668
bathroom for firewood, just

36
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,127
keeping things dry.

37
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,463
>> Anyone mind if I break in

38
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,422
the Dumpster?

39
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,590
>> Use the bathroom to keep the

40
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,549
wood dry.

41
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,216
Bobby just frustrates me.

42
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,217
I can't stand the fact that he's

43
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,218
not a gentleman.

44
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,136
>> I feel about ten pounds

45
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,971
lighter.

46
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:55,889
(groan)

47
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,599
>> PROBST: On Exile Island,

48
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,225
Terry deciphered the clues...

49
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,351
>><i> Why</i> they chose you to be the

50
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,269
first one out here.

51
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,104
>> PROBST: ...and found the

52
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,898
hidden immunity idol.

53
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,316
(whooping)

54
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,234
>> Beautiful.

55
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,444
"This talisman can be used to

56
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,737
keep you safe from the vote

57
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,279
at Tribal Council."

58
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,490
All right!

59
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,450
>> PROBST: Back at Casaya, the

60
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,868
alliance of four continued to

61
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,952
crumble.

62
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:18,953
>> For you to say it like that,

63
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,954
that's messed up.

64
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,789
>> And everybody here won't tell

65
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,873
you because they're afraid to

66
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,625
tell you the truth!

67
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,084
>> What are you talking about?

68
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:25,668
>> This foursome is like some

69
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:30,715
psychotic joke.

70
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,883
>> PROBST: Terry rejoined La

71
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,301
Mina at the immunity challenge.

72
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,053
Survivors ready? Go!

73
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:35,678
And Sally made a strong showing.

74
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,305
>> Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

75
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:37,931
>> PROBST: Sally running across

76
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,140
the beam.

77
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,767
But it was Casaya who took home

78
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,851
their second straight immunity.

79
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,354
Casaya wins immunity!

80
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,522
>> Yeah, buddy.

81
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,148
>> Yes!

82
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,483
>> PROBST: Though Sally was next

83
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,527
in line to be voted off...

84
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,569
>> It's a shame to pack up my

85
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,570
stuff and leave here with so

86
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,571
much left to offer this tribe.

87
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,572
>> PROBST: ...Austin made a bid

88
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,241
to keep her.

89
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,242
>> We got to have our strongest

90
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,954
team.

91
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,704
>> PROBST: Dan reminded his

92
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,872
tribe of their pact with Ruth

93
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,957
Marie.

94
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,958
>> We had an understanding to go

95
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,000
to the final five, and to change

96
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,377
horses midstream is a big

97
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,379
mistake.

98
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,090
It's crazy.

99
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:12,590
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

100
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,801
Council, the men chose strength

101
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,385
over their alliance as Ruth

102
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,514
Marie was voted out.

103
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,224
12 are left.

104
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:30,775
Who will be voted out tonight?

105
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,861
(theme song playing)

106
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,747
(birds singing)

107
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,260
>> Pretty proud moment for me to

108
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,595
be the last girl standing on

109
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,096
this tribe.

110
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,723
It's a very... how many women

111
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,726
have left.

112
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,603
>> At Tribal Council last night,

113
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,729
Ruth Marie went home.

114
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,230
I was a little disappointed in

115
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,440
that decision, but Nick, Austin

116
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,735
and Terry said that Ruth Marie

117
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,278
just couldn't hold her weight in

118
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,237
the challenges and that they

119
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,741
wanted to switch over to Sally.

120
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,910
>> I miss Ruthy already.

121
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,911
>> I do...

122
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,037
I was just going to say that.

123
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,996
>> Every day that I spent with

124
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,622
her, I was more and more amazed.

125
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,289
>> Yeah, I'm really going to

126
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,166
miss her.

127
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,125
>> Ruth Marie ended up getting

128
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,210
the votes and was sent home, and

129
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,837
I am telling you, I have never

130
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,298
felt so good in my whole life.

131
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,299
>> That water is disgusting.

132
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,467
>> Coming in here and feeling

133
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,677
kind of like the underdog and

134
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,386
the outsider right off the bat,

135
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,472
and the fact that the four men,

136
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,891
who have a very tight alliance,

137
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,475
made a decision that I was

138
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,226
valuable enough to keep around

139
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,313
felt pretty darn good.

140
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,113
>> The game plan this morning is

141
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,114
to get some water boiled so we

142
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,115
have water to drink, stay

143
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,285
hydrated.

144
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,669
>> I'm going to be designing a

145
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,670
Zen rock garden.

146
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,339
Um, just kind of bring kind of a

147
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,257
Zen beauty to this place, 'cause

148
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,217
it lacks it inside the

149
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,259
campground and inside some of

150
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:24,430
the people's souls.

151
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,598
>> It's like we never have an

152
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,475
easy fire day.

153
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,476
>> It's just hard to understand.

154
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,477
I mean, doing all the principles

155
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,646
and making a fire perfectly.

156
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,522
>> I know.

157
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,484
It's just wet wood.

158
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,111
>> I don't know what Bruce is

159
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,614
doing over there.

160
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,116
>> He's doing his rock garden

161
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,577
thing.

162
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,370
>> While we were making the

163
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,497
fire, Bruce built a rock garden.

164
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,498
It was just a question of

165
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,499
whether it was the appropriate

166
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:55,586
thing to build at the time.

167
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,509
>> It's dire straits right now

168
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,429
with the fire.

169
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,435
>> Bruce, I've gotten firewood.

170
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,477
You got to understand, this is

171
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,645
a really tough fire right now,

172
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,479
okay?

173
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,480
You made your rock garden.

174
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,606
No one went complaining.

175
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,566
I'm-I'm working on this.

176
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,734
I'm doing...

177
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:22,280
I'm working as a team, okay?

178
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,489
I definitely shouldn't have

179
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,574
yelled at Bruce, and I felt bad

180
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,783
about that.

181
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,576
It was just a matter of whether

182
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,162
or not the tribe needed a rock

183
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,705
garden or a fire.

184
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,497
When we're in the situation,

185
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,583
there's got to be priorities.

186
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,500
>> You attacked my character.

187
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,835
When you do that...

188
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,669
>> How did I attack your

189
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,712
character?

190
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,504
>> When you... when you just say

191
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,088
that was nothing over there.

192
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:39,672
You don't have no idea why I'm

193
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,299
building my rock garden.

194
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,175
>> When I said that was nothing?

195
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,051
>> The rock garden.

196
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:43,926
>> I didn't say anything was

197
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,761
nothing.

198
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,553
>> You come back with a

199
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:45,845
childish...

200
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,346
That was childish to come back

201
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,097
with.

202
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,765
>> So, you're...

203
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,557
Hold on, hold on.

204
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,433
You're calling me childish?

205
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:50,933
>> No, that remark was.

206
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,852
I said, "The childish remark."

207
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,187
>> Okay.

208
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,147
There was no disrespecting.

209
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,148
>> Okay.

210
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,107
>> If you can see...

211
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,067
I see where you're coming from.

212
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,068
Just try to see where I'm

213
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:00,985
coming from.

214
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,986
I wasn't trying to disrespect

215
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,820
you.

216
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,863
>> I know you're-you're the

217
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,781
master of the fire.

218
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,740
>> No, no, no, no. Hold on.

219
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:05,948
Hey...

220
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,366
>> That's why we...

221
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,159
>> It's all about communication,

222
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:08,951
Bruce.

223
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,744
>> Well, it is.

224
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,536
>> We're in a tough situation.

225
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,454
>> But don't come back... you

226
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:11,704
know...

227
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,497
>> So, Bruce, if you could get

228
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,456
some of that good wood...

229
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,249
>> Okay.

230
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,084
>> ...that's what we need right

231
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:16,876
now.

232
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,710
>> Okay, give me my machete.

233
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,586
>> There it is.

234
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,420
I'm the youngest person in this

235
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,046
tribe, and sometimes I feel like

236
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,339
I'm the oldest one in this

237
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,215
tribe.

238
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,174
Maybe I need kind of a little

239
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,175
bit of a break, a little bit of

240
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,551
calmness, so, to be perfectly

241
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,552
honest, I kind of<i> want</i> to go to

242
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,556
Exile Island.

243
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,142
>> PROBST: Casaya, La Mina,

244
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,229
come on in!

245
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,404
>> PROBST: Casaya, getting your

246
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:45,988
first look at the new La Mina

247
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,406
tribe.

248
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,491
Ruth Marie voted out at the last

249
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,536
Tribal Council.

250
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,620
You guys ready to get to today's

251
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,497
challenge?

252
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,790
>> Yeah!

253
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,250
>> PROBST: Okay, you are going

254
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,459
to transport rice, beans and

255
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,587
fish from a boat to the shore.

256
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,381
You will designate one tribe

257
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,715
member to be your retriever.

258
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,342
On my go, they'll race out,

259
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,218
retrieve one item, bring it

260
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,302
back to shore.

261
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,387
The rest of you will be lined up

262
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,721
like an assembly line.

263
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,973
You'll toss the item from one

264
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,057
person to the next.

265
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:13,683
When you reach the last person,

266
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,600
they'll toss it in the

267
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,476
appropriate bin.

268
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,603
The retriever goes back out,

269
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,521
gets another item.

270
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,730
First, you'll collect a bag of

271
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,982
rice, then you'll collect a bag

272
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,400
of beans, then you get to the

273
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,152
fish.

274
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:24,694
The fish are big.

275
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,570
And when you get to the end of

276
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,030
the line, the last person has to

277
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,699
chop the head and the tail off

278
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,659
the fish, throw the body in the

279
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:31,826
bin.

280
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,328
Two rules: if you throw an item

281
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,580
and the other person drops it,

282
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,622
you're responsible to get the

283
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,249
item, come back to your mat and

284
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,375
throw it again.

285
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,751
Second rule-- swapping positions

286
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,711
is fine.

287
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,587
You just need to tag out.

288
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,046
First tribe to get all their

289
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,630
items in the appropriate bins

290
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,258
wins reward.

291
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,259
Winning tribe gets it all.

292
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,427
>> Oh, my God.

293
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,219
>> PROBST: You get all of your

294
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,053
rice.

295
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,763
You get all of your beans.

296
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,681
You get all of your very large

297
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,683
fish, and to go along with it,

298
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,768
some spices for the fish, some

299
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,478
wine...

300
00:07:59,562 --> 00:07:59,729
(gasping)

301
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,480
>> PROBST: ...and some cooking

302
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,315
oil.

303
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,191
>> Oh, my God!

304
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,066
>> PROBST: For the losers, not

305
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,234
all bad news.

306
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,152
You will not go home

307
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,445
empty-handed.

308
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,779
The losing tribe will take back

309
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,406
with them either their rice or

310
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:10,698
their beans.

311
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,618
In addition, one member from the

312
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,203
losing tribe will be sent

313
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,287
to Exile Island.

314
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,288
Big enough stakes?

315
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,289
>> Yeah.

316
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,290
>> PROBST: Casaya, you have two

317
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,208
extra members.

318
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,167
Sitting two people out.

319
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,168
Who is it going to be?

320
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,127
>> It's going to be the two

321
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:23,878
young girls.

322
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,629
>> PROBST: Courtney and Danielle

323
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,004
will sit it out.

324
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,467
Take a spot, we'll get started.

325
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,093
Here we go, for reward.

326
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,720
Survivors, ready?

327
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:37,850
Go!

328
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,809

Go, Casaya!

353

These are going to be harder to

handle.

363
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,887

>> Let's go! Let's go!

Come on, take your time.

>> PROBST: If you throw it and

372
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,439
they drop it, you have to go

get it.

374
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,776
Look at La Mina moving!

tail and get it in the bin.

381

Both guys whacking at it.

383

Go!

398
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,572
You can switch out!

Shane in the water.

400
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:18,909
Go, La Mina!

>> PROBST: Got to get eight

403
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,829

00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,547
Cirie.

(overlapping shouting)

411
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,549
Bruce can't handle it.

412

>> Go, go, get it, get it!

413
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,720
>> Bruce, easy.

414
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,056

>> PROBST: Sally can't handle

430
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,126

Got to get eight total.

466
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,270
There you go.

>> PROBST: Bobby's been

470
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,112
fantastic with the knife.

471
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,155
Go, Casaya!

472
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:19,780
>> Switch!

473

We're tied, seven-seven.

478
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,248
This is the last fish.

479
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,750

>> PROBST: Bruce to Bobby.

485
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,720
This could be it!

486

>> You got this, Bobby.

487
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,014
>> PROBST: Get it in the bin.

Casaya! Wins reward!

491
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,606
>> That was awesome.

492
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,815
>> Bobby! Yo, baby!

493
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,903
Tonight we eat!

494
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,654
>> PROBST: Once again, another

495
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,823
very close challenge, but Casaya

496
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,409
continues their winning streak--

497
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,827
four challenges in a row.

498
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,828
La Mina, first you have a choice

499
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,746
to make.

500
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,580
Do you want the rice or do you

501
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,414
want the beans?

502
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,457
>> Beans.

503
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,500
Now, Casaya, you have a choice

504
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,667
to make.

505
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,293
Because La Mina lost, one person

506
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,462
is going to Exile Island; you as

507
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,046
the winning tribe are going to

508
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,048
decide who that will be.

509
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:19,882
>> Just out of respect, it's

510
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,883
going to be Terry.

511
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,718
>> PROBST: Terry.

512
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,053
Terry, you'll return to the next

513
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,012
immunity challenge.

514
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,764
You will compete with your

515
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,681
tribe in that.

516
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,977
Head on out.

517
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,939
Casaya, congratulations.

518
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:35,481
You got some eating to do

519
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,398
tonight.

520
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,858
>> Yay!

521
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,734
>> PROBST: Grab your stuff.

522
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,110
Head on back.

523
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,863
>> Oh, my God.

524
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,079
(thunder crashes)

525
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:13,477
>> Damn!

526
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,603
>> When we returned from reward

527
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,190
challenge-- ta-da!-- and

528
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,984
there's a lake.

529
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,197
>> This is a nightmare.

530
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,657
>> This is the biggest joke.

531
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,866
>> Total nightmare.

532
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,993
>> Our best reward today by far,

533
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,996
and we come home to a swamp.

534
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,373
No fire.

535
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,916
>> We have rice, we have beans,

536
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,543
we have wine and we have a ton

537
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,004
of fish, but we can't cook it.

538
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,797
Everything is wet.

539
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,381
We don't have any dry wood for

540
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,173
fire.

541
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,146
>> Straight raw, like sushi.

542
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,355
>> Of course.

543
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,440
>> It has to be almost a hundred

544
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,441
pounds of fish that we have

545
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,817
here, and we're just cutting

546
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,776
it up and eating it as

547
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,614
sashimi, raw fish, sushi.

548
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,159
>> This is cool for us to eat

549
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,118
this like this, right?

550
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:15,039
Ooh! I've never eaten raw fish.

551
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,373
I hope I don't wake up in the

552
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:16,957
morning with some kind of

553
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,169
sickness or something.

554
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,838
But they say it's okay to eat.

555
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:23,505
>> You never had sushi?

556
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,173
>> No.

557
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,382
>> What?

558
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,300
>> Excuse me.

559
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,134
>> Kill me.

560
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,427
>> No, no. I'm just shocked and

561
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,762
awed 'cause I eat it all the

562
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,513
time.

563
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,056
>> Cheers, salut.

564
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,849
Even though we've lost our home,

565
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:37,019
we've won a great little prize.

566
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,937
>> This is a tough situation.

567
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,105
It's two steps forward, three

568
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,231
steps back.

569
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,900
But I'm happy that we won.

570
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,026
We're bonding in our weird

571
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,404
Casaya strange-fish way.

572
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,957
>> Cheers, guys.

573
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,584
>> Yeah.

574
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,420
>> We made way too much, I

575
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,172
think.

576
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,256
>> Mmm.

577
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,716
>> We had a reward challenge and

578
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,095
the winner took all the spoils.

579
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,179
And guess who won?

580
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,264
Casaya, yet again.

581
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,224
They walked away with fish,

582
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,434
beans, rice.

583
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,894
We walked away with beans.

584
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:19,645
>> You guys gonna go in for

585
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,396
seconds?

586
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,021
>> Go for it.

587
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:21,939
>> You sure?

588
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,815
>> Yeah, take all you want.

589
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,400
There's more than enough.

590
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,734
>> But we're, of course,

591
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,236
absolutely jubilant to be

592
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,904
able to have food.

593
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,031
>> I feel nausea setting in.

594
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,574
>> I felt it as soon as I

595
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,826
stopped eating.

596
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,868
I'm just thinking it'll pass

597
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,328
within 20, 30 minutes.

598
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,122
(exhales)

599
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,081
>> How you feeling?

600
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,583
>> Not so hot.

601
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,251
It's already working it's way

602
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,086
through me.

603
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,003
My body's not responding too

604
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:45,921
well to putting the beans in the

605
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,632
system.

606
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,591
Nick and I are experiencing

607
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,136
a little bit of nausea.

608
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,303
Guess my system just wasn't

609
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,597
quite ready for some food.

610
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,557
>> I guess, you know, your

611
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,725
digestive system probably takes

612
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:02,604
a break when you're not eating.

613
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,981
I want this feeling in my

614
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,275
stomach to go away, Dan.

615
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,660
>> How are you doing?

616
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,039
>> Well, I was feeling better...

617
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,207
but I feel my stomach rumbling

618
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,001
again.

619
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,544
>> I have to go, too, dude.

620
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,253
Do you?

621
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,296
>> Yeah.

622
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,131
>> Oh, God, I got to go again.

623
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,509
God. This sucks.

624
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,343
>> You know what? We probably

625
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,345
didn't cook them enough.

626
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,263
>> Hey, Nick.

627
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:36,472
>> Hey.

628
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,098
>> How you doing, bud.

629
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:38,724
>> You guys do not want to know

630
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,434
the details of that excursion.

631
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,769
>> You have both ends going?

632
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,728
>> Yeah.

633
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,063
>> That stuff just wrecked me.

634
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,648
That was just gross.

635
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,275
>> How you doing, brother?

636
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,778
>> No doubt I'm going to have

637
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,695
to go again in about five

638
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,821
minutes.

639
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,739
>> I threw up, too.

640
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,032
>> Oh, you threw up, too?

641
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,074
>> Yeah.

642
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,785
>> I wish I could do that.

643
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,368
>> The beans we ate got myself

644
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,913
as well as Austin really sick.

645
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,456
Gastrointestinal details that

646
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,374
probably shouldn't be discussed

647
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,710
at this time.

648
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,795
>> Well, I got to go again.

649
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:12,800
>> I got to go right now, dude.

650
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,177
(thunder crashes)

651
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,286
>> Yeah.

652
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,290
>> They just do whatever they

653
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,793
want to do.

654
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,418
They always, they don't think of

655
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,294
other people first.

656
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,843
>> I hear ya... (hiccups)

657
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,994
>> There's so much to do, I

658
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,370
don't know where to begin.

659
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,455
That's gross.

660
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,248
I just feel like everything's

661
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,751
trashed.

662
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,878
Luckily, last night, the

663
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,046
rained stopped, so the lake

664
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,548
didn't go into our shelter.

665
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,299
And I don't know what happened

666
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,968
to Bruce and Bobby.

667
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,177
Apparently they slept in the

668
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,888
bathroom or something.

669
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,556
I can't wait to hear that story.

670
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,893
>> I didn't see it.

671
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,894
If they did that, that is so

672
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,604
wrong.

673
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,355
Like seriously... that's so not

674
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,901
right.

675
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,951
(laughs)

676
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,453
>> I'll get it.

677
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,955
I got to Casa de Charmin to get

678
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,497
some soap, and there's Bruce

679
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,291
folded over, I mean literally

680
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,378
folded in half, and there at his

681
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,379
feet-- hmm?-- the empty bottle

682
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,133
of wine.

683
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,260
>> I just threw it away.

684
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,471
>> I would have to be dead and

685
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,263
someone would have to pour it

686
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,349
down my throat for me to drink

687
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,391
the last bottle of wine that we

688
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,644
as a tribe won.

689
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:37,986
>> What happened to that last

690
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,864
bottle of wine?

691
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,531
>> You drank it?

692
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:41,782
>> Yeah.

693
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,617
>> You and Bruce, or just you?

694
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,201
>> I ended up sharing it with

695
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,953
him, but I thought...

696
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:46,787
I didn't think I had any place

697
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,663
to sleep...

698
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,664
>> You drank it yourself?

699
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,790
>> Yeah, that's what my plan

700
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,707
was, and then I went in there...

701
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,583
gave him some.

702
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,168
>> How do you feel about that?

703
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,419
>> You feel good about it?

704
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,712
>> Yeah.

705
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,672
>> Bobby said there was no room

706
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,673
in the shelter, but there was

707
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,465
plenty of room.

708
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,259
It was really bad judgment of

709
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,928
Bobby to open the bottle of

710
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,012
wine and drink it.

711
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:04,596
We all worked really hard for

712
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,223
that.

713
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:06,807
Wine out here is like super

714
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,684
special.

715
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,977
Now none of us really trust

716
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,185
Bobby.

717
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:10,686
We were all supposed to

718
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,436
celebrate and drink that wine

719
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,646
together.

720
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,939
>> Right, and I brought it in

721
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,232
there, we were supposed to drink

722
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:15,774
it last night...

723
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,067
>> Yeah, but why would you ever

724
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,110
do that on your own?

725
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:18,652
>> 'Cause, you guys...

726
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,945
I didn't have a place to

727
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:20,195
sleep...

728
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:20,654
>> You did.

729
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,697
>> I didn't think I did.

730
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,240
Maybe I did, but when I called

731
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:23,448
out...

732
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,658
>> You really made a bad, bad

733
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,033
call.

734
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:25,534
>> I don't feel bad that I

735
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,868
stole your wine.

736
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,494
Like I feel bad that I deprived

737
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,955
them of wine, but I have no hard

738
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,164
feelings whatsoever about the

739
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,624
fact that you've been deprived

740
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,626
of wine.

741
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,420
Courtney definitely had a right

742
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,963
to be upset.

743
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,547
I just don't need to hear it.

744
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,549
I really don't care what she

745
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:40,966
thinks.

746
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,134
She's probably one of the two

747
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,176
or three most annoying people

748
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,760
probably in the history of the

749
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,594
world.

750
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:44,970
>> It's so over.

751
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,430
I don't have the energy for

752
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:46,930
this.

753
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,473
The energy I want to put on is

754
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,308
for the camp and that's it.

755
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,395
Not on this stupid stuff.

756
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,031
>> Something told me I was

757
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,449
coming back here again.

758
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,826
I am on Exile Island for the

759
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,911
second time.

760
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,330
There's one less thing I have

761
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,665
to look for right now because I

762
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,500
have the hidden immunity idol.

763
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,169
I am more independent on my own

764
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,128
here.

765
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:18,670
Everyone leaves me alone.

766
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,881
I tend to have more time for

767
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,174
the survival part of what I

768
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:22,674
need to do about getting

769
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,093
rehydrated and getting food so

770
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,636
that I'm strong for the

771
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,432
challenges.

772
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,728
Finally a fire.

773
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,562
I am really concerned about my

774
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,523
tribe mates.

775
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,275
My worst fear for La Mina right

776
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,651
now is they're not properly

777
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,402
feeding themselves and keeping

778
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,155
hydrated.

779
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:58,001
That's my worst fear.

780
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,170
>> Creepy coffin.

781
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,588
>> Guys, we got tree mail!

782
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:05,258
>> Tree mail!

783
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,593
Here we go.

784
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,886
"From the depths of the ocean

785
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:08,553
floor you'll hold your breath

786
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,472
till you can take no more.

787
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,516
"Paddle and swim as your body

788
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,184
strains.

789
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,103
An immunity depends on how you

790
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,813
use your brains."

791
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,189
>> Exactly<i> not</i> what the doctor

792
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:19,481
ordered.

793
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,775
Last night was one of the most

794
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:22,609
miserable experiences of my

795
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,027
whole life.

796
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,320
The beans threw my system into

797
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,489
a whirl, and we've got an

798
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,073
immunity challenge coming up

799
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,534
that we desperately need to win.

800
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,576
>> This is, like, the true

801
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,494
measure of what you're made of.

802
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,538
>> It couldn't come at a worse

803
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:34,746
time.

804
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,580
So going in, I definitely

805
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,208
would not give us the edge,

806
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:38,750
seeing as we've lost four

807
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,002
in a row and are going in

808
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:49,803
semi-wounded.

809
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:58,645
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

810
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,022
We'll now bring in Terry, once

811
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,315
again returning from Exile

812
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,651
Island.

813
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,695
>> Hi, Terry.

814
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,737
>> What's up, T.D.?

815
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:12,617
(applause)

816
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,535
>> What's up?

817
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,578
>> How are you doing?

818
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,829
>> PROBST: Welcome back, Terry.

819
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,830
>> Thanks, Jeff.

820
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,622
>> PROBST: First thing's first,

821
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,625
Courtney, give it up.

822
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,294
Once again, immunity is back up

823
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,545
for grabs.

824
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,504
For today's immunity challenge,

825
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,548
you're going to collect skulls

826
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,092
from coffins sitting on the

827
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,302
ocean floor.

828
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,845
On my "go," three tribe members

829
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,180
will paddle out looking for

830
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,056
four coffins.

831
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,058
Each time you find a coffin,

832
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,518
dive down, untie the coffin,

833
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,519
open it.

834
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,604
You'll find a skull puzzle

835
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,272
piece.

836
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,940
Untie that, bring it back to

837
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:44,232
the boat.

838
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,650
Once you've collected all four

839
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,944
skull puzzle pieces, paddle

840
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,654
back to shore.

841
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,697
The two remaining tribe members

842
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,532
will then take those four skull

843
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,451
puzzle pieces and build a skull

844
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,328
pyramid.

845
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,579
The pieces will only go

846
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,663
together one way.

847
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,706
First tribe to build it

848
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,917
correctly and place their gold

849
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,669
skull on top wins immunity, is

850
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,047
safe from Tribal Council.

851
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,632
Losers, somebody going home.

852
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,174
Casaya, you're sitting two

853
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,759
people out, you cannot sit the

854
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,010
same people out in back-to-back

855
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:12,719
challenges.

856
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,929
Courtney and Danielle sat out

857
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:14,763
the last challenge.

858
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,056
>> We're going to sit out Cirie

859
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:16,306
and Bruce.

860
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:16,932
>> PROBST: Cirie and Bruce will

861
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,767
take a seat on this one.

862
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,435
The only thing left to find out

863
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,895
is if Casaya will continue to

864
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,772
dominate or if La Mina has found

865
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,524
a way to back into this game.

866
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,442
Take your spots.

867
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,445
We'll get going.

868
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,822
For immunity, survivors

869
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,909
ready?

870
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:36,576
Go!

871
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,035
>> Let's go! Let's go!

872
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,788
>> Go, Casaya!

873
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,580
>> PROBST: You're looking for

874
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,748
four coffins.

875
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,582
>> Paddle, paddle, paddle,

876
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,376
paddle, paddle!

877
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,418
>> PROBST: Terry trying to scope

878

Terry, Danielle diving in.

880
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,800
Four knots to untie on each

881
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:56,888
coffin.

882
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,935
Danielle pops up, but no puzzle

883
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:06,648
piece.

884
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,149
La Mina has their first puzzle

885
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,276
piece.

00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,800
Going to have to pick it up.

>> Watch your head, Dan.

900
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,181
Watch your head.

901
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:45,270
Watch your head.

902
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:48,982

903
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,358

La Mina with a big lead.

They have four puzzle pieces.

932
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,671
Could be the end of their

933
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,923
losing streak.

Here's the gold piece that goes

948
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,028
on top.

949
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,488
That's what you're building.

>> It's a triangle, it's not

951
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,865
square.

952
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:26,454
>> PROBST: Casaya not giving up.

953
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,622
>> Got it!

954
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,415
>> Come on, Casaya!

955
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,207
>> PROBST: Casaya with their

956
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,667
fourth puzzle piece.

957
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,126
They're heading back.

958
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,420
>> Hurry, guys!

959
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,256
>> Here, try putting two...

960
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,132
Is that it?

961
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:37,799
>> PROBST: That's not it.

962
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,842
>> We're still in it, Aras!

963
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:39,884
>> They can't get the puzzle!

964
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,803
>> PROBST: La Mina giving Casaya

965
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,138
a shot.

966
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,389
>> Come on!

967
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,849
>> Oh, God, this is driving me

968
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,308
crazy.

969
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,351
>> PROBST: Casaya, drop them on

970
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,978
the mat, on the mat!

971
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,771
Go, start solving it.

972
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,149
Shane and bobby are in this now.

973
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,359
They've had a lot of time to

974
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,694
watch La Mina and learn what

975
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,738
isn't working for sure.

976
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,239
>> It might go a little

977
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:01,990
vertical.

978
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,741
>> Yeah, like that.

979
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,659
>> There you go.

980
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,827
>> PROBST: Sally and Austin,

981
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,495
trying a different strategy.

982
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,955
One combination will work.

983
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,916
Nothing else will.

984
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,667
>> We're close.

985
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,710
>> PROBST: Shane and Bobby think

986
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,836
they're close.

987
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,340
>> That fits.

988
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,091
>> The gold skull!

989
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:20,758
>> Gold skull.

990
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,551
>> Gold skull, gold skull!

991
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:21,843
Gold skull!

992
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,510
>> That's it!

993
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,137
>> PROBST: La Mina has it!

994
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,889
La Mina wins immunity!

995
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:31,728
(cheers)

996
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,563
La Mina, back in the game.

997
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,106
Congratulations.

998
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,649
Nobody going home tonight.

999
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,359
Casaya, winning streak comes to

1000
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,569
an end.

1001
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,069
Tribal Council tonight.

1002
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:40,862
Somebody is going home from

1003
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,155
your tribe.

1004
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,698
Get your stuff, head on back to

1005
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:48,328
camp.

1006
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,421
>> Ow!

1007
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:03,176
Son of a...

1008
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,594
>> Guys?

1009
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:04,928
Bobby, okay?

1010
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,388
No other discussion.

1011
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,891
Bobby goes down on the card.

1012
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,059
>> We lost the immunity

1013
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,769
challenge today, which forces

1014
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,020
us to talk about voting someone

1015
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,021
off.

1016
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,022
The group wants Bob out.

1017
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,775
I don't want Bob to go.

1018
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,318
I think he's proved himself in

1019
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,986
challenges.

1020
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,616
>> It's got to be Bob, dude.

1021
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,869
>> Here's the thing.

1022
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,080
We cannot control Bruce.

1023
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,748
We can't.

1024
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,333
What does Bruce bring to the

1025
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,709
table that Bob-dog doesn't

1026
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,544
bring?

1027
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,044
>> Nothing really.

1028
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:38,336
>> Nothing.

1029
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,045
Are we good at Bruce?

1030
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,839
>> This is really stupid but

1031
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,549
all right.

1032
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,591
It's stupid, I'm telling you

1033
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,175
it's going to end up costing

1034
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,426
people.

1035
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,178
>> It's not.

1036
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,346
>> Bobby came from young guys

1037
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,598
camp to begin with.

1038
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,058
If we get to the merge, and

1039
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,101
Austin and Nick are still

1040
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,227
around, I've always been worried

1041
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,270
about Bobby joining back up

1042
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,020
with them.

1043
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,564
So that was the reason why I

1044
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,856
didn't want Bobby to make the

1045
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,649
merge.

1046
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,191
>> He's not going to flip.

1047
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,235
>> I don't care.

1048
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,236
Whatever you guys want.

1049
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,279
>> What, you're not going to

1050
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,154
write his name down?

1051
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,281
>> Who?

1052
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,949
>> Bruce.

1053
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,117
>> I didn't say that.

1054
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,284
>> Oh.

1055
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,244
>> What are you babbling about?

1056
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,287
Like, what are you talking

1057
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,162
about?

1058
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,080
>> Oh, I just...

1059
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,373
I didn't hear what you said.

1060
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,416
>> Okay, so right now you're

1061
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:16,958
writing down Bruce.

1062
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,501
The four of us are all writing

1063
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,085
down Bruce.

1064
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,004
Done deal, no problem?

1065
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,757
That's not a problem?

1066
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,634
>> Oh, my God!

1067
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,218
I'm walking on eggshells as it

1068
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,845
is.

1069
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,138
Because initially way back, I

1070
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,600
was told I'd be the next to go.

1071
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,351
I'm just trying to lay low, fly

1072
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,270
under the radar, let them kill

1073
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,022
each other, and don't think

1074
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,648
about me for...

1075
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:40,940
(laughs)

1076
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:45,028
for the vote tonight.

1077
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,070
>> I don't know what anybody

1078
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,197
else tells you, but you were

1079
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,699
going tonight.

1080
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,116
Straight up.

1081
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,701
You were gone.

1082
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,327
>> Mm-hmm.

1083
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,995
>> But Bruce is now gone.

1084
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,288
>> I know one of the things

1085
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,331
that people are worried about

1086
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,123
is that if we do make a merge

1087
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,542
and we're 5-5 that I'll jump.

1088
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,378
I'm not jumping.

1089
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,921
>> Okay, so when we get to the

1090
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:04,964
merge, you're not going to flop?

1091
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:05,965
>> Yeah.

1092
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,841
>> You won't?

1093
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:07,300
>> Yeah.

1094
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,635
>> Swear on my kid?

1095
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,177
>> Yeah.

1096
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,136
>> Swear on my kid.

1097
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,429
>> Yeah, I won't swear on your

1098
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,138
kid, but yeah.

1099
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,097
>> Swear on my kid.

1100
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,182
>> I'll swear on your kid.

1101
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:14,557
>> You won't flop?

1102
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,933
>> Right.

1103
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,644
And you're promising me what?

1104
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,686
>> I promise you I'm getting

1105
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,270
you the sixth.

1106
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,021
>> Yep.

1107
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:20,605
I'm good?

1108
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,147
>> On my kid?

1109
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,190
>> Mm-hmm, on your kid, on

1110
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:22,398
Boston.

1111
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,691
>> Awesome.

1112
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:31,074
>> All right.

1113
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,368
>> This is my first Tribal

1114
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,702
Council, so I'm trying to calm

1115
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,954
myself down, and I want to keep

1116
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,751
it low-key.

1117
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,378
I get frustrated with Courtney

1118
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,212
doing yoga on the Zen rock

1119
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,173
garden.

1120
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:51,636
To me, it's disgusting.

1121
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,220
She has no respect for me or

1122
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,598
anybody.

1123
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,767
We've got the whole beach here

1124
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,854
and she picks the spot I'm at.

1125
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,022
I'd rather be on Exile Island

1126
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,025
than be around Courtney.

1127
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,151
>> What do you think about

1128
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:07,777
Bruce?

1129
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,736
>> I trust him.

1130
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,404
>> 100%?

1131
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,613
>> Yeah.

1132
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,991
I do trust him.

1133
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,034
I don't trust Bobby.

1134
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,035
I don't.

1135
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,412
Courtney, why don't we switch

1136
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,705
this game up right now and

1137
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:18,913
vote...

1138
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:19,580
>> I was just thinking about-- I

1139
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,123
was like, "At least I got my

1140
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,290
girls."

1141
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,709
>> ...vote off Bobby?

1142
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,751
>> You know what I mean?

1143
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,627
>> Let's vote off Bobby.

1144
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,545
>> Dude, I'm just scared of--

1145
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:25,920
I'm just trying...

1146
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:26,421
>> I'm scared of that.

1147
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,046
I don't like that.

1148
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,090
Aras is putting himself, setting

1149
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,091
himself up.

1150
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,467
>> Aras is setting himself up so

1151
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,468
hard-core...

1152
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:32,927
>> Mm-hmm.

1153
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,845
>> ...and he's going to be so

1154
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,012
impossible to beat.

1155
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,055
>> How about we just get Shane,

1156
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,182
me, you-- us four vote for

1157
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,560
Bobby.

1158
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,145
Aras wanted Bruce gone.

1159
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,187
I just-- I didn't feel

1160
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,189
comfortable with that.

1161
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,816
I wanted Bruce to stay and I

1162
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,109
wanted Bobby to go, so I took

1163
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,652
control and I said this is not

1164
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,654
what I want.

1165
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,739
Keep Bruce.

1166
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,949
I'm telling you it's a better

1167
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:56,868
decision for all of us.

1168
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,243
It's less risky.

1169
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,370
>> Bobby's not going to flop.

1170
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,455
>> I just don't trust him.

1171
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,497
>> I don't trust him either.

1172
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,498
>> Okay, here's the deal.

1173
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,541
I can't vote him off.

1174
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,834
I swore on my kid that he was

1175
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,752
the sixth.

1176
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,044
I can't.

1177
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,087
>> Of course he's going to swear

1178
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,088
on your kid.

1179
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:09,464
Why wouldn't he?

1180
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,090
He knows he's getting voted off.

1181
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,925
He's going to say anything.

1182
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:13,926
>> That's-- here's the deal.

1183
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,552
>> Bruce would stay with us more

1184
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,012
than Bobby would.

1185
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:16,763
>> I agree.

1186
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,388
>> Well, why didn't you tell me

1187
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,224
that an hour ago, Courtney?

1188
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,392
You said an hour ago...

1189
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,393
>> Don't yell at me.

1190
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,520
>> I'm just yelling in general.

1191
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,063
And stop with the "don't yell at

1192
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:26,898
me."

1193
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:27,940
I'm just-- we're talking.

1194
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,233
You wouldn't listen to me when I

1195
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,151
was telling you all this stuff

1196
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:30,651
about Bobby.

1197
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,194
>> Well, you were right.

1198
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,487
>> I don't want Bobby making it

1199
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:32,820
to the merge.

1200
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,738
>> You were right.

1201
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,363
>> You were right.

1202
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:34,781
>> You were right.

1203
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,157
>> You were right, you were

1204
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,450
right.

1205
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,911
>> You were right and now you've

1206
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,412
been talked to and changed your

1207
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,413
mind.

1208
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,164
You were right from the

1209
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:43,623
beginning.

1210
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,166
>> I mean, honestly.

1211
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,209
>> Everyone's out of their mind.

1212
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,211
There's nothing I can do.

1213
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,253
I told everybody initially that

1214
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,546
Bobby should go and then they

1215
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,589
all freaked out and said

1216
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:51,839
nothing.

1217
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,381
They're like women, you know

1218
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,091
what I mean, and now they're

1219
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,094
going back to Bobby.

1220
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,845
So it's like, you know, who

1221
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,931
knows?

1222
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,238
>> PROBST: Everybody has a torch

1223
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,239
except Bruce.

1224
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,240
There's one on the end.

1225
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,491
Go ahead and grab it.

1226
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:22,787
Approach a flame and get fire.

1227
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,999
Fire's gone, so are you.

1228
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,296
Shane, last time you guys were

1229
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,840
here, I kind of felt as though

1230
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,383
this was a tribe that was in a

1231
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,759
bit of disarray.

1232
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,885
Has that changed?

1233
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,178
>> I would say that we are the

1234
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,597
dysfunctional functional tribe.

1235
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,890
I think when it comes to

1236
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,308
challenges, we step up and we

1237
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,810
know how to work together, but

1238
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,186
this tribe can be really, really

1239
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,187
tiring.

1240
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,105
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1241
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,731
what's going on at camp life.

1242
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,817
You've had some heavy downpours.

1243
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,193
How's the shelter holding up?

1244
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,486
>> I ended up sleeping in the

1245
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,821
outhouse that night.

1246
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,822
>> PROBST: In the rain?

1247
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,364
>> Yeah, in the outhouse.

1248
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,283
>> With the bottle of wine.

1249
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,826
>> I went in there just kind of

1250
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,535
trying to get comfortable for

1251
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,619
about an hour and all of a

1252
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,704
sudden I hear a knock on the

1253
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,581
door, and Bobby shows up with a

1254
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,124
bottle of wine-- and at 2:00,

1255
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:08,666
3:00 in the morning in the

1256
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,251
freezing rain with my butt

1257
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,461
sore-- and I said "I could use a

1258
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,462
drink."

1259
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,380
>> PROBST: Did anyone know,

1260
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,673
Bobby, that you took the bottle

1261
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,090
of wine?

1262
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:17,258
Was that okay with them?

1263
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,551
>> No, they didn't know and I

1264
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,802
found out later that it wasn't

1265
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,595
okay.

1266
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,096
But the reason why Bruce and I

1267
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,181
ended up in the outhouse is that

1268
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,557
the spots that we had reserved

1269
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,349
were taken and I was left to

1270
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,392
sleep exposed to the rain.

1271
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,227
So I was like, "All right, well,

1272
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,312
now I got this bottle of wine

1273
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,229
and everybody I was supposed to

1274
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,731
share it with is asleep and my

1275
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,440
spot's been taken, so, all

1276
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,524
right, let me go over here and

1277
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,609
get my drink on with my boy

1278
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,610
Bruce."

1279
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,444
>> PROBST: I've got to say if

1280
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,529
I'm the other five people, I'm

1281
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,822
looking at you and Bruce and

1282
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,823
thinking, "You guys don't want

1283
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,283
to be a part of this tribe?

1284
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,284
Tribal Council is easy."

1285
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:43,618
>> Oh, I agree.

1286
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,995
It was very-- I gave them plenty

1287
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:46,996
of ammunition.

1288
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,288
You know?

1289
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,289
I didn't think it was wrong, but

1290
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:48,831
I understood people could be

1291
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,790
disappointed.

1292
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,083
What I apologized for wasn't the

1293
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:51,667
act, but it was for the way it

1294
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,419
made people feel if it made

1295
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,212
people feel a certain way.

1296
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,714
>> PROBST: Cirie, did Bobby make

1297
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,090
a mistake?

1298
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:58,633
What did Bobby do from your

1299
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,344
point of view?

1300
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,596
>> I think it was a huge, huge

1301
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,307
mistake only because we all as a

1302
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,102
group fought for the reward

1303
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,188
challenge, and the reasoning

1304
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,564
that he's coming up with just

1305
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,566
doesn't sound good to me.

1306
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,859
>> But I also feel like we're

1307
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,485
all getting on Bob.

1308
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,488
Bruce knew very well as well

1309
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,530
that there was three other

1310
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,448
people that wanted that wine.

1311
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,533
>> I'm just as guilty and I

1312
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,535
apologize to the group now, but

1313
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,496
even then nobody came up to me

1314
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,789
and said, "Bruce, you ass, you

1315
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,665
drank that."

1316
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,208
I'm just going with the group,

1317
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,459
and if they made it clear it was

1318
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,294
just horribly wrong, you could

1319
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,295
have talked to me.

1320
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,756
>> But, Bruce, the onus is not

1321
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,340
on them to ask for you to

1322
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,341
explain yourself.

1323
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,384
I think that you're responsible

1324
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,469
to go up to the people in the

1325
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,512
group and to say, "Look, I made

1326
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,514
a selfish decision and I

1327
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,515
apologize."

1328
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,225
I mean, to Bob's credit, he

1329
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,768
lived up to it, said, "Yo, I did

1330
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,352
this," but to just kind of

1331
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,395
pretend like it didn't happen,

1332
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,105
to shuck it off your

1333
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:54,397
shoulders...

1334
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,314
>> It wasn't even on my mind

1335
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:55,690
today.

1336
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,482
There was so much that we had to

1337
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,566
do.

1338
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,526
That probably was the furthest

1339
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,362
thing from my mind, honestly.

1340
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,405
>> PROBST: Bruce, do you feel

1341
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:02,738
unappreciated?

1342
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,032
>> Oh, yeah, at times, because

1343
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,993
they ask for my suggestion, then

1344
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,703
they challenge it.

1345
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,329
I've never been challenged more

1346
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,414
times in my life on advice that

1347
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,166
was asked for me in over a whole

1348
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:14,792
year combined with thousands of

1349
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,334
students.

1350
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,836
It's unbelievable.

1351
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,129
>> But Bruce, we are not your

1352
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,005
pupils.

1353
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,131
All right, we're your

1354
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:20,715
tribesmen, and so when you do

1355
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,340
get challenged, you can't look

1356
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,718
at it as some sort of ego blow,

1357
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,760
but, no, this is a tribe

1358
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,386
learning to work together.

1359
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,303
>> You're completely wrong

1360
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:26,512
there.

1361
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,221
I don't think that.

1362
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,139
I was just throwing that out.

1363
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:28,723
>> I just think he just feels

1364
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,557
like he's not getting the

1365
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,892
respect that he deserves.

1366
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,853
He's an older man, he's a wiser

1367
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:34,478
man, he has more experience than

1368
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,438
everybody, and I just think

1369
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,356
sometimes he doesn't get the

1370
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,317
respect that he deserves.

1371
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,360
>> You know, I apologize to you

1372
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,653
guys, and I'll tell you I'm

1373
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,946
gonna take everything you say to

1374
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,530
heart.

1375
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,448
You know, if something is going

1376
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,158
to bother me, I'll clear it up

1377
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,159
right on the spot.

1378
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,368
Then you guys are in for it

1379
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,661
because you'll hear more of me

1380
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:50,870
then.

1381
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,371
You guys, I appreciate you guys.

1382
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,000
Come on.

1383
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:56,500
I will, I will.

1384
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,086
That's, that's a promise.

1385
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,463
>> PROBST: Before we get to the

1386
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,840
vote, Bruce is the only one of

1387
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,133
this tribe that's been to Exile

1388
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:04,675
Island.

1389
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,593
He could have found the hidden

1390
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,719
immunity idol.

1391
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,346
Whether he did, it would not

1392
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,388
come into play until after the

1393
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:09,597
vote.

1394
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,600
Cirie, you're up.

1395
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,574
>> Bobby, you're just too

1396
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,494
egotistical and you're selfish.

1397
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,046
>> Bruce, I just didn't think I

1398
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,131
could trust you.

1399
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,472
>> This is a throwaway vote.

1400
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,849
It doesn't mean anything.

1401
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,393
I'm trying to make my vote go

1402
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,230
away.

1403
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,315
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1404
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,400
votes.

1405
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,077
Once the votes are read, the

1406
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,078
decision is final.

1407
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,121
The person voted out will be

1408
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:15,913
asked to leave the Tribal

1409
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,289
Council area immediately.

1410
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,500
I'll read the votes.

1411
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:25,506
First vote: Courtney.

1412
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,884
Bruce.

1413
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,595
Bobby.

1414
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,517
One vote Bobby.

1415
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,518
Aras.

1416
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,353
That's one vote each for Aras,

1417
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,564
Courtney, Bruce and Bobby.

1418
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,526
Bruce.

1419
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,530
Two votes Bruce.

1420
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,531
Bobby.

1421
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,700
Here's where we stand-- two

1422
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,077
votes Bobby, two votes Bruce,

1423
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:55,661
one vote Courtney, one vote

1424
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,538
Aras.

1425
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:02,501
One vote left.

1426
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,669
Bobby.

1427
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,879
Fifth person voted out of

1428
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,756
<i>Survivor: Exile Island.</i>

1429
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:16,390
Bobby, the tribe has spoken.

1430
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:18,475
It's time for you to go.

1431
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,689
Well, no doubt in my mind you

1432
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,733
were in disarray when you walked

1433
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,110
in here tonight, but maybe the

1434
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,237
honesty shared here tonight

1435
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,572
could be the answer to bringing

1436
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,573
this group together.

1437
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,866
Grab your torches, head back to

1438
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,867
camp.

1439
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,953
Good night.

1440
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:43,959
Captioned by

1444
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:49,840
from our next episode.

1445

>> PROBST: Next time on

1446
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,136
<i>Survivor,</i> the women want

1447
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,137
Shane out.

1448
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,889
>> It's going to be a stealth

1449
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,183
chop of the head, guillotine-

1450
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,184
style.

1451
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,227
>> PROBST: La Mina hits rock

1452
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:01,435
bottom.

1453
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:03,354
>> Down the hatch.

1454
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,355
>> Ugh!

1455
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,023
>> PROBST: A big twist could

1456
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,233
mean salvation for one...

1457
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,234
>> Oh!

1458
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:08,817
>> PROBST: ...and a Tribal

1459
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,487
Council like never before.

1460
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,451
>> I don't really know what to

1461
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:17,618
say.

1462
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,202
I wasn't expecting to be here

1463
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:18,953
this early.

1464
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,037
I feel like I never really got

1465
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,746
my game off the ground.

1466
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,205
I could have played it

1467
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:21,830
differently, but the truth was I

1468
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,582
just couldn't stomach a lot of

1469
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,333
these jokers.

1470
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:24,917
People in Casaya were bonded

1471
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,710
together out of weakness, out of

1472
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,002
desperation.

1473
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,505
Courtney, Danielle and Shane

1474
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,547
are spineless little twerps, all

1475
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,507
of them, and just being around

1476
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,132
them made me want to throw up.

1477
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:32,758
You know, at least I don't have

1478
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,009
to be them.

1479
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,095
I get to be Mr. Bob Dog.
