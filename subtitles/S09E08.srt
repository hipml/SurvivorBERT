At Lopevi, the tribe had enough

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,135
of John's lazy attitude.

5
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,511
>> He's the kind of person that

6
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,512
coasts through the game.

7
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,054

the fact that the women had this

37
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,426
walked away with victory.

gonna shaft us whenever they

70

get a chance, but little do they

come through, and he did,

sparing himself and his tribe

76
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,678

won, but at the same time, I

looked over at Lopevi, and it

87
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,025
hurt to know that either Julie

88
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,527
or Twila are going home tonight.

00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,166
vote, and if it ever came down

102
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,793
to him and one of us in the

103
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,335

the vote when the guys trusted

the women's loyalty and voted

109
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,719
out John.

home.

00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,528
Temporarily, I'm still here, so

don't want any manioc?

cold.

But then, once the fire started

147
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,600
and kind of snuggled in closer,

148
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,810
and Sarge was just kind of

149
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,938
letting it happen.

her sex appeal and her young age

00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:07,515
There's no doubt about it.

Not much I can do about it.

170
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,810
She's 22 years younger than I

She's a model.

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,152
And hell, yeah, them guys'd be

572
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,279
stupid if they didn't read

573
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:47,988
something into that last night.

574
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,407
>> I don't think we've

575
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,784
got much to worry about.

576
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,369
Julie's security is right here.

577
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,828
She proved that in Tribal

578
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,120
Council.

579
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,997
>> And with Twila, she's too

580
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,249
stubborn to go with those women.

581
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,793
>> She's not going.

582
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,543
>> Nah.

583
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,711
This morning, I had a

584
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,338
conversation with Chris about

585
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,590
this sort of, you know, unity in

586
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,634
our pact, and we decided to go

587
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,885
one step further.

588
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,178
>> Do you want to do the

589
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,471
one I want or do you have

590
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,055
something with Sarge already?

591
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,808
>> Sarge has never said

592
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,601
"let's go to the end together."

593
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,728
>> Sarge would be a hell of a

594
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,689
choice to take to the final

595
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,482
two because he would win.

596
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,066
>> I'm going to be honest

597
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,276
with you, I think both of you

598
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,152
got a leg up on me.

599
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,112
Dude, I didn't mean to say that.

600
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,071
>> No, I...

601
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,281
>> Totally, dude.

602
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,324
>> Listen, no.

603
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,826
There's so many puns, dude.

604
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,785
There's a million.

605
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,203
>> God, I didn't just say that.

606
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm pretty much covering all

607
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,038
my bases.

608
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,124
Covering all my bases means I'll

609
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,792
be good any way it goes.

610
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,209
And the final two.

611
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,253
>> All right, man.

612
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:44,503
>> Hey.

613
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,213
I threw my hand out.

614
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,881
It's just me reassuring my

615
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,508
position in the game because

616
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,134
basically I have the same

617
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,928
agreement with Sarge, and I've

618
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:53,971
pretty much made the same

619
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:54,847
agreement with Julie.

620
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,056
So, okay, let's say we merge, do

621
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,391
you want to stick together and

622
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,851
watch out for each other or not?

623
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,601
>> Yeah.

624
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,311
>> I mean, if you're not

625
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,563
comfortable doing it...

626
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,188
If you don't trust me, all

627
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,607
you've got to do is tell me.

628
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,525
I understand that.

629
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,151
>> No.

630
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,986
>> Maybe I'm going places

631
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,571
I shouldn't be going, but if we

632
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,406
merge, Julie could go, Sarge

633
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,198
could go, Chad could go.

634
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,743
I'm always going to have two

635
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,369
others I can rely on to watch

636
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,037
my back.

637
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,584
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

638
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:29,631
All right.

639
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,300
Shall we get to the challenge?

640
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,427
Take back immunity.

641
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,220
What happened to the immunity

642
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:35,637
idol?

643
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,305
>> They broke its neck.

644
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,098
>> I went to stick it in

645
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,601
the ground and he snapped.

646
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,436
>> PROBST: So the immunity idol

647
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,270
is broken, which is just as

648
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,814
well, because we don't need

649
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,440
it anymore.

650
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,691
>> Uh-oh.

651
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,610
>> PROBST: Drop your buffs.

652
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,652
Buffs, drop 'em.

653
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,403
>> God.

654
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,946
>> PROBST: Take 'em off.

655
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,364
Drop them at your feet.

656
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,699
You're now one tribe.

657
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,036
>> Whoo!

658
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,290
>> Hi, Sarge.

659
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,503
>> PROBST: All right, guys, one

660
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,378
big decision to make right now.

661
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,880
Which beach are you going to

662
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,130
live on?

663
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,882
>> The guys, they've got

664
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,841
an excellent place.

665
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,425
The beach is a lot closer and

666
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,385
it's better and there's a big

667
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,303
fire up on the hill.

668
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,346
>> Let's go to the guys.

669
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,472
>> Let's go to the guys.

670
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,515
>> PROBST: Lopevi is the beach?

671
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:19,765
>> Lopevi.

672
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,225
>> PROBST: So all of Yasur's

673
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,559
personal items, all your reward

674
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,894
items, everything you have will

675
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,895
be waiting for you at Lopevi's

676
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,270
beach.

677
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,021
>> How exciting.

678
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:26,563
>> PROBST: When you guys get

679
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,189
back to camp, you'll figure

680
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,357
out a tribe name and paint up

681
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,775
a tribe flag.

682
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:30,359
>> Okay.

683
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,777
>> PROBST: Okay, shall we get to

684
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,528
today's challenge?

685
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:32,820
>> ALL: Yes.

686
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,738
>> PROBST: This is what you

687
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,532
covet now, individual immunity

688
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,616
from here on out.

689
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,242
Here's the challenge.

690
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,494
It is a water race.

691
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,162
You'll start on the beach, swim

692
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,081
out to a water tower, climb up

693
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,958
the ladder, walk over a balance

694
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,835
beam, grab a flag, jump off and

695
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,795
swim back to shore and put it in

696
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,796
the flag holder.

697
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,589
The first two tribe members to

698
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,216
get all three flags back in

699
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,759
their flag holder move on to the

700
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,176
final round.

701
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,511
Because there are ten of you

702
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,387
we will run two heats, five

703
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,347
each, two people from the first

704
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,766
heat, two people from the second

705
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,226
heat will move into the final.

706
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,144
One person will win immunity.

707
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,813
The other nine, vulnerable at

708
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,355
the next Tribal Council.

709
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,565
Clear?

710
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,107
>> Clear.

711
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:10,566
>> PROBST: All right.

712
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,692
We'll draw numbers to figure out

713
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,442
your position.

714
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,403
Let's go.

715
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,404
Here we go.

716
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,198
The first heat is Julie, Eliza,

717
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,325
Leann, Chris and Sarge.

718
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,286
The first two to finish move on

719
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,579
to the final round.

720
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,621
Survivors ready.

721
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,040
Go!

722
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,423
Sarge first to the ladder.

723
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,467
Chris right behind, then

724
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,720
Leann, Eliza and Julie.

725
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,390
Sarge is in the water, Eliza

726
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:43,724
in the water.

727
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,349
Chris in the water.

728
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,643
Julie and Leann bringing up the

729
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,604
rear.

730
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,232
Sarge back with one.

731
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,735
Eliza right behind.

732
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,278
Chris right behind.

733
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,072
Julie and Leann struggling.

734
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,741
Sarge back on the beam.

735
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,659
He's got his second flag.

736
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,453
Eliza, she has her second flag.

737
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,497
Chris making up some time.

738
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,291
Leann wearing down.

739
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,419
Sarge back with two flags, going

740
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,879
for his third.

741
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,591
Chris catching on Eliza and

742
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,467
passing her.

743
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,261
Julie back with her second.

744
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,513
Sarge first in the water with

745
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,432
his third and final flag.

746
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,308
Remember, first two to finish

747
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,810
make it to the final round.

748
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,270
Going to be between Eliza and

749
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,772
Chris for the third flag.

750
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,273
Sarge moving on to the final

751
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:33,899
round.

752
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:34,441
Eliza has taken Chris over

753
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,401
again.

754
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,028
She's in the lead.

755
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:38,612
It's going to be a race for

756
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,614
second place between Eliza and

757
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,240
Chris.

758
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,282
Who will get back first?

782
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,089

00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:39,673
great effort.

784
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,426
Rory has a big lead.

785
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,352
Chad hanging on.

786
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,063
He's not fallen off yet.

787
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,649
Fighting to stay in this.

788
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,901

791
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,535
Can Chad make up enough time?

792
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,705
Rory and Ami, both winded.

793
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,166
Looking to get into that last

794
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:14,458
round.

795
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,172
Rory and Ami are neck and neck.

796
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,257
Rory wants to win this thing.

797
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,510
Rory, Ami, moving on to the

798
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,179

799
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,513
All right, here we go.

Final round.

Rory, Sarge, Ami, Eliza.

802
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,602
First person back with all three

803
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,270
flags wins immunity.

804
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,521
Survivors ready.

805
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,148

Ami places her jump.

814
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:58,794
Eliza in the water.

815
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,129
Rory's going to have to hustle

816
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,881
if he wants a shot at immunity.

817
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:03,590
Sarge back with one.

818
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,343
Anything could happen.

Eliza back with one.

822
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,516
>> Come on, Sarge!

823
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,852
>> PROBST: Sarge has his second

824
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,938
flag, Rory right behind.

825
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:18,647
Keep moving, Rory.

826
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,690
Let's go, Ami.

827
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,984
Sarge wants that immunity.

828
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,612
He's back with his second flag.

829
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,446
Everybody worn out.

830
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,990
Running this back-to-back,

831
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,826
taking its toll.

832
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,369
Ami pushing.

833
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,287
>> Come on, Ami!

834
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,580
You got one more!

835
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,665
>> PROBST: Sarge in the water

836
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,834
with his third flag.

837
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,627
Rory and Ami falling behind.

838
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,587
Eliza out of it.

839
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,677
Sarge wins first individual

840
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:48,927
immunity.

841
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,972
>> Good job, Sarge.

842
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,641
>> You did a good job.

843
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,434
>> You animal.

844
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,562
>> PROBST: Sarge, come on up

845
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,938
here.

846
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,522
See if this will fit over that

847
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,982
big noggin.

848
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,984
Congratulations.

849
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,945
Safe at the next vote.

850
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:07,571
Everybody else on this new tribe

851
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,989
vulnerable.

852
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:09,573
You'll head back to the former

853
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,867
Lopevi beach, figure out a new

854
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,410
tribe name and figure out who

855
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,870
is going home at the next Tribal

856
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,370
Council.

857
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:15,871
Good effort.

858
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,622
Head on back.

859
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,739
(<i> whooping</i> )

860
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,532
>> Lopevi and Yasur were

861
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,491
merged today.

862
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,285
We picked the Lopevi camp, kind

863
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,037
of mutually, and for the first

864
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,914
time since day one I'm putting

865
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,207
the game behind me, and I'm

866
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,625
going to just have some fun with

867
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,918
these people that I've never

868
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:03,585
met.

869
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,464
(<i> talking and laughing</i> )

870
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,382
>> I am thrilled.

871
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,426
I just missed Twila deep down in

872
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,011
places I can't talk about.

873
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,095
It's just a happy moment, you

874
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:14,888
know.

875
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:15,555
Coming together, reunions

876
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,933
are always a happy moment.

877
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,352
>> Oh, my God!

878
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,353
(<i> talking excitedly</i> )

879
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,022
Food!

880
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,734
>> We come back to Lopevi

881
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,027
beach, and there was a big

882
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,528
celebration feast waiting for

883
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,739
us.

884
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,450
(<i> talking excitedly</i> )

885
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,077
We had cheese and crackers and

886
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,744
dried fruit, and they had a

887
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,163
bunch of leftover chocolate

888
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,831
cake.

889
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,792
>> Oh, my gosh.

890
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,379
>> Wine.

891
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:47,796
>> That's awesome.

892
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,799
>> I want a nut.

893
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,591
>> Salute.

894
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,842
>> Yeah, salute.

895
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:57,097
(<i> whooping, laughing</i> )

896
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,806
>> This place is off the

897
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,640
chain right now.

898
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,101
We got wine in the outrigger

899
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:01,559
here.

900
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,436
We've got two tribes come

901
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,647
together and I mean, everybody

902
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,564
is just so happy.

903
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,649
It's a festival right now, and

904
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,651
I'm enjoying it.

905
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,569
Yeah!

906
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,487
>> Look at Sarge.

907
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:12,862
>> There's coffee.

908
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,031
>> Sarge, you're going to

909
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,701
take off like a rocket.

910
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,619
>> I will really enjoy the

911
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,870
coffee, believe me.

912
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,872
>> I am just so completely

913
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,791
ecstatic to be back among men.

914
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,585
I mean, I never thought I would

915
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,254
make it out of Yasur.

916
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,255
>> It was different when y'all

917
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:30,630
left.

918
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,631
Real different when y'all left.

919
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,799
>> Man, I'm so tired of

920
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:37,387
having female conversation.

921
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,888
Ami is...

922
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,098
>> Yeah.

923
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:40,807
>> Chad is a total blast

924
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,392
to be around.

925
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,853
It's great listening to him.

926
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,605
We've had a good time.

927
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,652
>> Oh, my God.

928
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,738
Oh, man.

929
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,655
We've only been together, like,

930
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,199
ten minutes and right off the

931
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,951
bat, Rory let me know that Bubba

932
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,995
got caught by Ami trying to

933
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,164
throw a signal back to us, and

934
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,458
he got crushed like a doggone

935
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,462
bug.

936
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,796
>> You know, you just got

937
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,548
to talk to Chad, I guess, and...

938
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,383
and see what's up.

939
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,634
>> I want some coffee.

940
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,635
>> Twila, you got a cup

941
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,428
right here for yourself.

942
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,471
>> Oh, thank you.

943
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,013
>> Yeah, I'm going to the

944
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,222
water hole.

945
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,016
>> Sarge, we're out of water.

946
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,683
>> I'm fine, man.

947
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,727
>> I'm cool.

948
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,936
>> We'll just chill here

949
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,021

1136
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,360
all to look at all sides of it.

1137
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,653
We can't be playing back and

1138
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,028
forth.

1139
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,071
>> Maybe you need to talk

1140
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:10,321
to Sarge.

1141
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,197
>> It's kind of hard with

1142
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,157
ten people around here to talk

1143
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:13,741
to anybody.

1144
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,953
>> I know.

1145
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,163
>> This is so much fun.

1146
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,124
>> Ami has control of all

1147
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,709
the women.

1148
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,335
She gets them in her aura and

1149
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,211
pulls them in and then tells

1150
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,088
them what to do, and they run

1151
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,256
out like little chickens, you

1152
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,424
know, with their head cut off

1153
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,758
doing what she says, and she

1154
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,176
sits back being the innocent

1155
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,845
little girl that doesn't do

1156
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:34,303
anything wrong, and...

1157
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,222
and it's dangerous.

1158
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:40,184
It's real dangerous.

1159
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,228
Bottom line is I want her away

1160
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,271
from Julie, 'cause Julie is

1161
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,898
like laying under her arm and

1162
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,608
being kissed on the top of the

1163
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,276
head by her and stuff, and

1164
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,070
telling how hot she is and,

1165
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,364
you know, it's just like what

1166
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:53,781
the hell, you know.

1167
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,282
I just want her...

1168
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,409
>> Out of here.

1169
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,285
>> ...out of here before she

1170
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,912
infects Julie, and she turns

1171
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,997
her charm on you.

1172
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,497
>> No.

1173
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,081
>> And she says come on,

1174
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,125
Twila, let's go lay down.

1175
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,543
>> Sarge.

1176
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,253
(<i> both laughing</i> )

1177
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,090
(<i> speaking indistinctly</i> )

1178
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,383
>> No, Twila, lower.

1179
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,134
>> Each to their own, but

1180
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,719
no thank you.

1181
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,345
>> Lower, Twila, there it is.

1182
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,723
Right now, with Twila and Julie,

1183
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,017
I feel confident about the way

1184
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,476
they talk.

1185
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,144
They talk with a lot of faith,

1186
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,312
a lot of character.

1187
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,688
She's a little confused on who

1188
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,065
was going home tonight and she

1189
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,191
made me a little uneasy for a

1190
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:28,441
second.

1191
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,610
But, you know, we have a

1192
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,028
pact, and we're sticking

1193
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:32,820
to the pact.

1194
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,613
>> All right.

1195
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,864
That's all I needed to know.

1196
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,823
We can't be playing back

1197
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,407
and forth.

1198
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,617
>> We're not going to...

1199
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,076
>> Because I don't like that.

1200
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,703
>> Okay, okay.

1201
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,996
>> I just told Chris, I

1202
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:42,580
said, you all make the choice.

1203
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,248
If you want to vote for Ami,

1204
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:44,665
just let me know.

1205
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,167
Just let me know what you all

1206
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,960
want to do, and I'll follow it.

1207
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,295
>> I feel confident about Twila.

1208
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,131
I feel confident about Julie and

1209
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,133
obviously Rory has come back to

1210
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:54,926
Lopevi.

1211
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,094
We've got the numbers.

1212
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:56,511
We'll be good to go.

1213
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,346
Picking them girls off one by

1214
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,430
one is what it's going to be.

1215
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,640
>> I got bloody knife on

1216
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,766
this one and a spider on this

1217
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,600
one.

1218
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,559
>> Evil.

1219
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,060
>> Evil.

1220
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,436
>> I don't know, like, what's

1221
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,896
been going on throughout

1222
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,481
the day, but I don't think that

1223
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,275
Twila and Julie ever left the

1224
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,276
women's alliance.

1225
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,361
They had to do what they had to

1226
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,531
do to survive with all men, but

1227
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,741
I don't see Twila ever, ever

1228
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,367
leaving the women's alliance.

1229
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,828
>> Stick five tight, and

1230
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,745
we've got it made.

1231
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,162
>> Okay.

1232
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,288
>> We're going to be in

1233
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:24,664
trouble tonight.

1234
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,998
>> We are.

1235
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,333
What are we going to do?

1236
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:31,754
>> Play the game.

1237
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,966
The guys think we're with them.

1238
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,509
The girls automatically think

1239
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,177
we're with them, so who knows?

1240
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,012
After tonight, somebody is going

1241
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,556
to be pissed, but we've got to

1242
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,932
do what we've got to do.

1243
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,642
I feel bad because I care about

1244
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,226
every one of them, but I'm

1245
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,603
beating them to the punch.

1246
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,354
I'm cutting their throat before

1247
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,232
they cut mine.

1248
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,291
>> PROBST: Welcome.

1249
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,250
First things first.

1250
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,751
I got to know what the new

1251
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,752
tribe name is. Ami?

1252
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,545
>> Alinta.

1253
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,504
>> PROBST: Alinta.

1254
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,672
Sarge, how'd you come up with

1255
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,256
that?

1256
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,632
>> The name came from

1257
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,301
Scout, who knew the word for

1258
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,343
fire-maker, so we figured it's

1259
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,054
appropriate, Islands of Fire,

1260
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,181
fire-maker.

1261
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,974
>> PROBST: Julie, what happened

1262
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,267
in terms of workload and

1263
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,852
leadership and all that?

1264
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,145
>> Well, gosh, half the

1265
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,688
tribe worked on the flag and a

1266
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,398
lot of people went for wood, and

1267
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,192
oh, yeah, a lot of the day was

1268
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:34,609
spent on body paint.

1269
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,652
>> PROBST: Who does the best

1270
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,028
work?

1271
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,487
>> Oh, this one right here.

1272
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,238
That one's by far is the best.

1273
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,406
>> Yes.

1274
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,450
(<i> all laughing</i> )

1275
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,619
>> PROBST: Well, don't waste

1276
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,536
your flirting on me.

1277
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,579
I can't help you any.

1278
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,164
>> I know.

1279
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,457
>> PROBST: Leann.

1280
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,292
Would you have preferred to stay

1281
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,960
as the Yasur tribe and let

1282
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,837
Lopevi stay as the Lopevi tribe?

1283
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,797
>> No. I mean, I think a merge

1284
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,341
signifies getting further

1285
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:58,633
in the game.

1286
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,635
I mean, having us all come

1287
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,427
together feels like, "God, we

1288
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,013
really made it this far," and

1289
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,598
this is where it should get fun

1290
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,349
and interesting and screwy.

1291
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,476
>> PROBST: Rory, you've got to

1292
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,019
feel like you were just given a

1293
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,603
second chance.

1294
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,230
>> I know for a fact that I've

1295
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,439
been given a second chance,

1296
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,273
because Vegas wouldn't have

1297
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,109
given me odds on making it out

1298
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,486
of the Yasur camp, quite

1299
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,153
frankly.

1300
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,821
I struggled and I scratched and

1301
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,447
I clawed and I prayed and I

1302
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,116
hoped that I'd hit a merger for

1303
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,618
an opportunity for a shot at

1304
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,285
the second half of the game, and

1305
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,829
that's what I've been able to

1306
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,497
pull through.

1307
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,581
>> PROBST: Ami, did you think

1308
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,540
you'd make it this far?

1309
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,250
>> Yeah.

1310
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,543
>> PROBST: Based on what?

1311
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,295
What skills do you bring to

1312
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,171
this game?

1313
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,006
>> What skills do I bring...?

1314
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,507
A da... a good attitude.

1315
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,842
A good attitude, no matter what.

1316
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,510
Even when things are getting

1317
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,971
rough, I usually have a good

1318
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:45,388
attitude.

1319
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,889
It's gotten me this far in

1320
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,390
life, so...

1321
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,141
Play with a smile and good

1322
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:49,600
attitude.

1323
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,268
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1324
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,144
tonight's vote.

1325
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:52,728
It's always tough when you get

1326
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,438
to the merge, because you never

1327
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,606
know what's going to happen.

1328
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,024
You don't know who you can trust

1329
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,067
and who you can't trust.

1330
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,651
Twila, do you feel a little

1331
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,736
stuck in the middle because

1332
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,238
you've been on both tribes?

1333
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,572
>> Most definitely.

1334
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,615
Oh, most definitely.

1335
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,533
I feel real stuck in the middle.

1336
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,868
I've enjoyed both tribes.

1337
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,412
I felt more at ease around the

1338
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,413
guys-- there's no doubt about

1339
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:10,621
that.

1340
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,540
But, you know, you form

1341
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,457
alliances with one side and then

1342
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,876
another side and you're kind of

1343
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,253
stuck in the middle, but

1344
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,879
tonight, no matter which way it

1345
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,422
goes, it's gonna be tough.

1346
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,340
>> PROBST: Sarge, you have the

1347
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,508
immunity necklace, if you want

1348
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,676
to assign it to somebody else,

1349
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,093
you can.

1350
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,845
>> Nope. It's mine tonight.

1351
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,721
>> PROBST: All right.

1352
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,972
Sarge is the only person you

1353
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,514
can't vote for.

1354
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,807
Everybody else is fair game.

1355
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,474
With that, it's time to vote.

1356
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,269
Chris, you're up.

1357
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,991
>> You're just the, um,

1358
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,576
unfortunate victim of the

1359
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,619
master plan.

1360
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,603
>> RORY: Ami, this is the first

1361
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,438
time that I've made a completely

1362
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,231
personal vote.

1363
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,941
Your treatment of me over the

1364
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,484
last nine days has been

1365
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,943
horrible.

1366
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,695
I have little or no respect for

1367
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,529
you, and I really hope that,

1368
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,740
like a bad rash, you're

1369
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,449
finally gone.

1370
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,035
Thank you.

1371
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,017
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1372
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,061
votes.

1373
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,741
Once the votes are read, the

1374
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,158
decision is final.

1375
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,535
The person voted out will be

1376
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,536
asked to leave the Tribal

1377
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,578
Council area immediately.

1378
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,455
I'll read the votes.

1379
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,042
First vote...

1380
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,585
Ami.

1381
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,841
Ami.

1382
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,843
That's two votes Ami.

1383
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:36,809
Ami. Three votes Ami.

1384
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,102
Ami.

1385
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,856
That's four votes Ami.

1386
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,482
Rory.

1387
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,862
Four votes Ami, one vote Rory.

1388
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:53,409
Two votes Rory, four votes Ami.

1389
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,535
Rory.

1390
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,537
That's four votes Ami, three

1391
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,873
votes Rory.

1392
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,710
We're tied.

1393
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,796
Four votes Rory, four votes Ami.

1394
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,261
Rory. That's five votes Rory,

1395
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,554
four votes Ami.

1396
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,517
Ninth person voted out of

1397
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,562
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu,</i> Rory.

1398
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,148
Bring me your torch.

1399
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,990
Rory, the tribe has spoken.

1400
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,624
It's time for you to go.

1401
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,136
Well, you are the final nine.

1402
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,638
Seven of you will make up the

1403
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,389
jury, two will make it to the

1404
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,224
final Tribal Council.

1405
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,434
One will win a million dollars.

1406
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,894
Grab your torches, head back

1407
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:02,478
to camp.

1408
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,105
Good night.

1409
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,664
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1410
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,290
from our next episode.

1411
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,668
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1412
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,378
>> Camp sucks, kissing and

1413
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,587
I want to cuddle with you.

1414
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,256
I'm tired of hearing "I love

1415
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,257
you, you love me."

1416
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,757
>> I'm pro love, man.

1417
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,884
>> It makes me sick.

1418
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,094
>> PROBST: And Alinta gets a new

1419
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,011
pet.

1420
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,012
>> Help! Come here!

1421
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:37,972
>> It's a pig.

1422
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,265
>> I can taste his fatback

1423
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,349
cooked up with my cabbage.

1424
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,394
>> No, no, you can't eat him.

1425
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,401
>> I think that I am the victim

1426
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,361
of a gender war right now.

1427
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,196
The women, they have got the men

1428
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,823
bamboozled into thinking that

1429
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,366
they had an opportunity.

1430
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,242
I may not be a million dollars

1431
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,411
richer, but I will never forget

1432
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,662
the Islands of Fire.

1433
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,539
No one has enjoyed the

1434
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,164
experience of being on this land

1435
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,125
more than I have.
