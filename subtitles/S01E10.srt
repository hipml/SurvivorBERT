00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,588
ANNOUNCER:
<i>16 Americans marooned</i>
<i>for 39 days</i>

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,508
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,594
<i>Separated into two tribes,</i>
<i>Tagi and Pagong</i>

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>they competed against each</i>
<i>other to remain on the island.</i>

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,058
<i>But now the tribes</i>
<i>have merged into one.</i>

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,062
<i>Rattana is the name, and it is</i>
<i>everyone for themselves.</i>

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,439
<i>Every third night</i>

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,107
<i>the entire tribe will hike</i>
<i>deep into the jungle</i>

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,110
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the tribal council</i>

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,613
<i>where they must vote one</i>
<i>of their own off the island.</i>

11
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>In the end, one will remain</i>

12
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,327
<i>and will leave the island</i>
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

13
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,459
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor...

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,920
<i>Kelly began to have doubts</i>
<i>about her role in the alliance.</i>

15
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,630
KELLY:
<i>If we stick with it</i>

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,674
<i>it's just like lining lambs</i>
<i>to the slaughter.</i>

17
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,301
Who goes next? Who goes...
that's no fun.

18
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,137
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And tension mounted</i>
<i>when Rudy burned the food.</i>

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,264
Pathetic, burnt

20
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,599
overdone, wasteful, again.

21
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,018
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Colleen won</i>
<i>the reward challenge...</i>

22
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>and invited Jenna</i>
<i>to a barbecue meal</i>

23
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,815
<i>where a plan was hatched</i>
<i>to vote Rich off the island.</i>

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,399
You, me and Gervase
could definitely

25
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,193
do something.

26
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,527
So let's do it.

27
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,489
ANNOUNCER:
<i>But it wasn't a picnic</i>
<i>back at Rattana</i>

28
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,824
<i>where Rich let it all hang out</i>
<i>on his birthday.</i>

29
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,578
RUDY:
<i>When I go home, my wife asks me</i>
<i>about, well, who was with you</i>

30
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,831
I'll say a queer that ran around
bare-assed half of the time.

31
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,126
ANNOUNCER:
<i>At tribal council, the three</i>
<i>former members of Pagong</i>

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,336
<i>tried to vote Rich</i>
<i>off the island.</i>

33
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,546
Happy birthday, Rich.

34
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,256
<i>And Kelly broke</i>
<i>the voting alliance</i>

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>leaving them only three strong.</i>

36
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,845
<i>But it was Sean who became</i>
<i>the unknowing swing vote</i>

37
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>his alphabetical voting</i>
<i>strategy,</i>

38
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,141
<i>casting the death vote</i>
<i>for Jenna.</i>

39
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,810
Last vote...

40
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,812
"J" for "Jenna."

41
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:45,939
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Seven people left...</i>

42
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,316
<i>who will be voted off tonight?</i>

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,236
Captioning sponsored by CBS
and SURVIVOR PRODUCTIONS

44
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,398
KELLY:
<i>It's weird the day</i>
<i>after anybody leaves</i>

45
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,443
<i>there's just,</i>
<i>there's just this void of,</i>

46
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,613
"Oh, wait," you know,
"someone's...

47
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,323
someone's not here."

48
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,491
RUDY:
<i>Gervase was going to get</i>
<i>voted off the last time</i>

49
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,579
<i>but at the last minute</i>
<i>they changed it to Jenna.</i>

50
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,582
And I think that
that was the women's idea.

51
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,919
SUSAN:
<i>The sun is out, it's going</i>
<i>to be a nice hot day.</i>

52
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,794
<i>And it's quieter.</i>

53
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,339
Sorry, Jenna,
but, man, you talk a lot.

54
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,303
Do you guys
agree with me?

55
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,096
I mean she is very
hard to live with.

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,182
You guys lived with
her longer than me

57
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,809
and I don't know how
she stayed on your team
till you got over here.

58
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,312
I thought she would have went
a lot sooner than she did.

59
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,813
Everybody did.

60
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,522
We've been here for
what, 28, 29 days now

61
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,483
and I don't think people realize

62
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,570
that it's 28 days
with people 24/7.

63
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,696
You know what I mean?

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,697
There's no break.

65
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,823
It really is
up in the air

66
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,368
you never know who's going next.
And that why I love it.

67
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,994
You can think
you're going

68
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,371
but then
the surprise comes

69
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,789
'cause I thought I was going.

70
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,667
GERVASE:
<i>It's like 11 days left.</i>

71
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,670
<i>I'm totally shocked that</i>
<i>I'm still here right now.</i>

72
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,004
If you look at it
since the merger

73
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,839
it's only been Pagong people
being voted off.

74
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,551
<i>You know, so it's like...</i>
<i>something's fishy going on.</i>

75
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,137
You know, they can deny
an alliance all they want

76
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,639
but there's got to be
an alliance.

77
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,142
SEAN:
<i>No, I'm not 100% sure.</i>

78
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,812
<i>If there is an alliance,</i>
<i>they are just voting in block</i>

79
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,355
but I don't know
if there is one.

80
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,524
I haven't been asked to partake
in one or anything yet.

81
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,358
<i>Dirk got four votes.</i>

82
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,860
<i>Gretchen got four votes.</i>

83
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,487
<i>Greg got four votes.</i>

84
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,531
Sean, come on, open your eyes.

85
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,243
<i>Sean is interesting because</i>

86
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,245
I'm debating right now
if I want to vote him off

87
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:47,870
at the next council.

88
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,872
<i>Because he's so scared</i>

89
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,333
<i>of hurting somebody's feelings</i>
<i>by voting for them</i>

90
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,876
<i>that he's voting</i>
<i>alphabetical order.</i>

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,211
I mean, he led the way

92
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,671
for Jenna to be
kicked off yesterday.

93
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,881
"J" for "Jenna."

94
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,883
RICHARD:
<i>And last night at the council</i>

95
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,888
<i>Sean realized that his vote</i>
<i>impacted who gets voted off</i>

96
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,516
because we only needed
to use three

97
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,601
of our four allied
people's votes

98
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,104
to get Jenna ejected.

99
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,398
Whatever vote I was going
to go they were going to copy.

100
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,691
If I knew that

101
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,235
I would certainly have
abandoned this strategy earlier.

102
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,570
Everybody yelled at me
for doing this alphabet...

103
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,364
I thought I was being fair,
but actually

104
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,866
I think I was targeting people

105
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,243
and also if they weren't
being targeted

106
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,745
I was going to be targeted.

107
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,080
Because who the hell wants me
voting for them, you know?

108
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,582
Either I was going
to be out

109
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,293
or, or I would keep getting
other people's feelings hurt.

110
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,086
COLLEEN:
<i>It's like Sean walked into this</i>

111
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,422
<i>and somebody forgot to tell him</i>
<i>it was a game.</i>

112
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,424
<i>And he's very concerned</i>
<i>about people's emotions</i>

113
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,092
and feelings,
which is wonderful

114
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,220
<i>you know, if you're</i>
<i>taking care of a pet.</i>

115
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,597
<i>You know, not if you're playing</i>
<i>a game called</i> Survivor

116
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,769
and the point of the game is to
strategize and eliminate people.

117
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,937
It just felt a little scummy
to me at the time

118
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,940
but after last night where
the remaining tribe members

119
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,776
of both parties said
we really don't care,

120
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,444
<i>it's just a game,</i>

121
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,820
every single one of them

122
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,406
has tried to form a strategy
with me personally.

123
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,329
RICHARD:
<i>Now people are talking</i>
<i>about planning</i>

124
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,497
<i>and plotting and strategy.</i>

125
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,124
And it's just so funny.

126
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,501
So utterly, utterly,
utterly naive

127
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:22,632
that there would be any room
left to plot or strategize now.

128
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,052
Rich is very arrogant,
very cocky

129
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,513
<i>and very, very overconfident.</i>

130
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,098
<i>And I thought, you know what</i>

131
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,974
<i>let's take Rich down</i>
<i>a couple pegs.</i>

132
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,809
RICHARD:
<i>I got bombarded</i>

133
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,644
at the council,
at the immunity council.

134
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,686
Little alliance

135
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,817
tried to attack Richie
on my birthday.

136
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,027
Now he's going to
not fish no more.

137
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,029
How freaking funny
would it have been if he got

138
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,738
sent home on his birthday,
though?

139
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,907
I wasn't even
expecting that.

140
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,451
Rich was this close
to leaving last week.

141
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,661
That was a good feeling.

142
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,454
For me, it was just
a great feeling.

143
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,456
<i>And you could see</i>
<i>it's affected Rich.</i>

144
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,667
<i>After those three votes,</i>
<i>Rich was...</i>

145
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,460
<i>he couldn't believe it.</i>

146
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,712
Rich even thinks I, uh...

147
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,465
formed an alliance
against him last night.

148
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,508
Which I didn't.

149
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,885
That's okay,
no hard feelings.

150
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,972
I'll just catch
less fish.

151
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,515
We like the fish, Rich.

152
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,892
Yeah, I thought you
liked the fish, Gerv.

153
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,894
Not as much as I thought
you did, though.

154
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,320
RICHARD:
<i>When I fish</i>
<i>is somewhat strategic.</i>

155
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,530
<i>So I'm thinking to myself</i>

156
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,199
<i>it would be a heck</i>
<i>of a lot more valuable</i>

157
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,994
<i>I guess to me, if I got fish</i>

158
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,912
<i>after a couple more folks</i>
<i>were gone.</i>

159
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,873
And I'll limit the fish
that I'm getting

160
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,500
so that I'm not out here
working my ass off

161
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,837
and people just expect that
there will be lots of fish.

162
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,714
When we get down
to the last four
or five of us

163
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,673
I'll feed us
I can't wait.

164
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,884
I can't wait.

165
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,051
It ain't happening
faI know.gh.

166
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,052
Enjoy your day.

167
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,387
Okay, thanks,
you be careful.

168
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,430
I'll see you later.

169
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,472
All right, bye-bye.

170
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,561
SUSAN:
<i>I don't blame him one bit</i>
<i>for not worrying about fishing</i>

171
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,188
till there's five people.

172
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,815
That's a lot of mouths to feed
and they don't appreciate it.

173
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,452
RICHARD:
<i>There are analogies between</i>
<i>my going out to the reef</i>

174
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,953
<i>and hunting the fish</i>

175
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,790
<i>and my picking off the tribe</i>
<i>members one by one.</i>

176
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:24,253
<i>I've been stalking them since</i>
<i>before we got on the island.</i>

177
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,468
<i>Bye-bye, baby.</i>
<i>(Gulps</i> )

178
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,265
<i>it's a slow, more methodical</i>
<i>game here on the island</i>

179
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,060
<i>with each of the tribe members</i>
<i>than it is with the fish</i>

180
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,270
<i>but there are similarities.</i>

181
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,440
<i>That's probably the last fish</i>
<i>I'll get until there are five.</i>

182
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,400
<i>There are seven participants</i>
<i>right now</i>

183
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,402
and I probably won't bother
to get any more fish

184
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,862
until there are five people.

185
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,791
SUSAN:
<i>Colleen and Gervase</i>
<i>are just sitting over there</i>

186
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,336
<i>and I'm like,</i>
<i>"You backstabbers."</i>

187
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,754
<i>First you want him out of here,</i>

188
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,172
and then you're
all over the food.

189
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,592
I'm getting
filled up tonight
on one bowl.

190
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,094
That's sad.

191
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:13,803
(<i> burps</i> )

192
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,930
Ooh, good rice,
Rudy.

193
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,682
You're the best.

194
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,308
I got some nice belches
out here.

195
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,810
<i>My strategy all along</i>

196
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,980
has been to just play the role
as a dumb redneck.

197
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,523
(<i> belches</i> )

198
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,316
there you go,
Suzy Q.

199
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,319
SUSAN:
<i>People like think rednecks</i>
<i>are so vulnerable and dumb</i>

200
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,655
<i>they'll talk to them openly.</i>

201
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,740
Like Rich did.

202
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,158
(<i> laughs</i> )

203
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:36,826
you know, how he's going
to burn everybody.

204
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,496
Okay, so here's
the deal.

205
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,957
I want you to pick her
to be ejected, not me.

206
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,791
So you can plan that.

207
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,668
SUSAN:
<i>Hopefully in the end</i>

208
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,839
the, the old redneck will burn
the city slickers.

209
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,549
So we'll see what happens.

210
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,843
You know, I think it
would be best

211
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,678
is if we can,
me and you

212
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,763
can take care of...
take him out
at the end.

213
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,390
Yeah.Rich out?

214
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,017
Just me and you.

215
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,561
<i>I've been knowing all along</i>
<i>that I'm going to burn him</i>

216
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,022
but I didn't want to say
anything to Kelly too early.

217
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,732
Why do you think he got
so many votes against him

218
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,983
at the last council?

219
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,527
He's a snake. I got
to thank him, though

220
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,321
for getting our crap
together early.

221
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,864
If it wasn't for him,
we might not have

222
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,532
gotten together this early.

223
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,533
<i>I never trusted Rich.</i>

224
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,868
<i>Of course I don't trust him.</i>

225
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,369
<i>But am I doing a good job</i>

226
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,996
<i>making him think I trust him?</i>

227
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,873
<i>I hope it looks</i>
<i>like I trust him now.</i>

228
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,084
I knew he was working on
you to get me out anyway.

229
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,669
Oh, yeah.

230
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,546
He's not that
... smart.

231
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,881
<i>Right now I don't trust anybody</i>
<i>except for Kelly.</i>

232
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,925
<i>I trust Kelly 100%.</i>

233
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,219
100%, And she trusts me
the same.

234
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,554
We're like sisters.

235
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:40,222
I want me and you
to take him out.

236
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,265
I think so.

237
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,516
Just the three
of us.

238
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,517
But you got
to let him...

239
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,518
I really would.

240
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,728
I would feel good.

241
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,605
I would feel so good
about myself.

242
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,231
KELLY:
<i>I really like Sue a lot.</i>

243
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,526
We've bonded quite a bit
in these 30 days.

244
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,403
And it'll be 20 years
come this Easter

245
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,030
that I lost my best friend.

246
00:10:56,113 --> 00:11:00,117
<i>So, coming across Kelly,</i>
<i>somebody I can hang with...</i>

247
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,788
that's a long...
I ain't going to ... her.

248
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,166
I'm not burning her.

249
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,380
KELLY:
<i>The only person I trust</i>

250
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,092
<i>is Sue, and sometimes</i>
<i>I doubt that.</i>

251
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,593
It's getting to that point

252
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,428
where you don't know
who you can trust.

253
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,931
RICHARD:
<i>But I got to remember</i>

254
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,933
it's a game.
And I believe them.

255
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,768
I believe you,
I believe her.

256
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,104
And I believe Kelly.

257
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,106
But I don't know if Kelly
is as solid as that

258
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,273
all the way through,
I hope so.

259
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,608
I'm betting on it.

260
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,777
I was betting on it by bringing
her into this.

261
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,945
And I'm feeling
very good about Sue.

262
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,447
If they're not

263
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,949
then they're brilliant
because they've played me well.

264
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,785
They've played me beautifully.

265
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,621
SUSAN:
<i>I'd rather just me and Kelly</i>
<i>burn him.</i>

266
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,333
<i>Just because</i>
<i>it'll feel so good.</i>

267
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,961
RICHARD:
<i>If the alliance</i>
<i>were to break down</i>

268
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,339
<i>and something else happened</i>
<i>that I wasn't aware of</i>

269
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,259
<i>I would shake those people's</i>
<i>hands and say congratulations</i>

270
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:58,926
<i>you, you know, brilliant</i>

271
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,429
good job, you got it

272
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,472
because you've fooled me.

273
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,141
Me and Kelly
are taking him down.

274
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,075
Watch out for that.

275
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,161
Uh-oh.

276
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,954
A cigar!
A message!

277
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:27,997
RICHARD:
Uh-oh.

278
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,665
Oh, shut up.

279
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,666
Only one cigar?

280
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,001
Are we going
to have to roll 'em?

281
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,002
No, there's more.

282
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:37,506
Whoo!ah!

283
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,800
Roll that bad boy,
light that bad boy

Yeah!me!

286
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,180
Okay.

287
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,515
"This is an announcement
for Gervase...

288
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,683

Nah-uh.

Yay, Gervase!

291
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,149
About your son.

"Gunner Peterson was born
yesterday at 3:05..."

00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,696
Hey, everybody,
it's a boy!

294
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,156
Smoke up!

295
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,366
Smoke up.

296
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,620
RICHARD:
I didn't even know Gerv was
having another baby.

297
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,579
GERVASE:
<i>It's real simple.</i>

298
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,041
I have two kids
from a previous relationship:

299
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,251
Dawnelle's ten,
Genelle is seven.

300
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm with Carmela now

301
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,546
Kayla with her and now Gunner.

302
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,341
You know, Kayla's two
and Gunner's the new addition.

303
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,927
Four kids-- holy Moses.

304
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,888
Now are you
and, uh, Gunner

305
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,767
and Kayla's mom together
permanently?

306
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,060
GERVASE:
Nah, never
been married.

307
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,062
Yeah, we have
some rough spots

308
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,231
we need to fix that

309
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,567
so we're just smoothing
those out, you know.

310
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,070
RUDY:
<i>When I was brought up,</i>
<i>if a girl was pregnant</i>

311
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,239
<i>and wasn't married,</i>

312
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,282
<i>you'd never even know it.</i>

313
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,576
<i>I mean, they'd take her out</i>
<i>of town or somewhere.</i>

314
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,452
<i>It was that bad, you know.</i>

315
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,037
The girl could have
had an abortion.

316
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,167
I-I'll agree with an abortion.

317
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,881
But not having kids
out of wedlock.

318
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,591
It's a<i> huge</i> responsibility.

319
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,592
Huge.

320
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,387
It's hard enough
for one family,
much less two.

321
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,805
Yeah, one child's
a huge responsibility

322
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,514
<i>let alone two.</i>

323
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:13,394
<i>Four kids between two families.</i>

324
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:23,821
No way, man.

325
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,031
Oh, no way.

326
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,658
Is it empty?

327
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,076
It's empty.

328
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,411
Oh, what a...

329
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,999
Oh, man.

330
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,250
Oh, my god.

331
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,501
WOMEN:
Pizza!

332
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,629
You were talking
about pizza.

333
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,133
"An oven fresh pizza,
doesn't that sound nice?

334
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,304
"A phone call's been placed,
steady feet win a slice."

335
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,471
Some balancing crap.

336
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,973
It's going to be
some balance.

337
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,225
"Steady feet,"
could it be hot coals?

338
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,811
No.

339
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:59,523
"A phone call's been placed,"
they called Pizza Hut.

340
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,317
That's what that means.

341
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,947
Uh...

342
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,329
Day 28 on the island

343
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,372
and after almost
a month of nothing

344
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,249
rewards are everything.

345
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,169
Today's reward challenge
is very simple:

346
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,295
Simply stay on your feet
long enough

347
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,882
to make it from one end
of the course to the other.

348
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,342
For the winner--
a phone call home

349
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,845
<i>with the Ericsson world phone,</i>
<i>to the person of their choice</i>

350
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:33,515
<i>plus a slice of hot pizza,</i>
<i>delivered by helicopter.</i>

351
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,393
Hi, Jeff.

352
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,519
What's up, G?

353
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,062
Sean.

354
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,146
What's happening?

355
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,398
Congratulations on your baby.

356
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,983
Thank you, sir.

357
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:43,567
JEFF:
That's great news.

358
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,779
The game is
very simple.

359
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,488
You're moving across
bamboo poles.

360
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,531
The first one to the end wins.

361
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,533
Speed and balance are key.

362
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,370
There's going to be three legs
to the race.

363
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,539
In the first leg, the fastest
four will move on;

364
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,501
in the second leg, the fastest
two will move on.

365
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,711
The third leg is for the prize.

366
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,128
Let's go.

367
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,069
Survivors, ready?!

368
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,529
Go!

369
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,825
(<i> shrieks</i> )

370
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,203
Yeah.

371
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,913
(<i> clapping</i> )

372
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,081
JEFF:
Had to stay on.

373
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,416
Ah, come on.

374
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,834
You had to stay up.

375
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,588
We're looking for two here.

376
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,424
Survivors, ready?!

377
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,008
Go!

378
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,930
Whoa, it's Rich
and... Gervase.

379
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,266
Sue, it was Gervase by a nose.

380
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,268
You're always
in there, though.

381
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,561
Yeah? That's all right.

382
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,770
JEFF:
Richard and Gervase

383
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,564
you have to get
across here.

384
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,442
The first person
here, the other
guy's got to secede.

385
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,901
Don't push him off.

386
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
You got to land here

387
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,612
and plant it
with two feet.

388
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,072
If you fall off

389
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,991
the next guy gets
a shot, you go back.

390
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,117
For the prize,
survivors ready?!

391
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,202
Go!

392
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,380
(<i> others cheering</i> )

393
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:33,802
baby, you're getting
some pizza and
a phone call home.

394
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,928
Good effort, man.

395
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,805
Good effort.

396
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,223
All right, Gervase,
here comes your pizza.

397
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,775
Is that it?

398
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:54,031
That's it.

399
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,908
Hang tight.

400
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,336
Oh...

401
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,464
Hot slice of cheese.

402
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,174
The middle of the
South China Sea,

403
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,009
pizza delivered
by a helicopter.

404
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:16,303
It is your slice
to enjoy here.

405
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,972
So have at it.

406
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,973
Gerv, it's all yours.

407
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,558
Do not share, Gerv.

408
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,186
Gerv, eat it.

409
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,355
Nobody wants it?
Nobody wants it?

410
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,190
I want a bite.

411
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,319
I don't want
any really.

412
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,032
Oh, yeah.ite.

413
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,492
I know you're
a big pizza fan.

414
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,493
Thank you, Gerv.

415
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,078
This is plenty for me.

416
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,745
Now finish it up.

417
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,330
GERVASE:
That's a big slice.

418
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,499
All right, Gerv.

419
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,172
JEFF:
<i>Okay, Gervase, now for</i>
<i>the second part of the reward.</i>

420
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,215
We have a cell phone here.

421
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,384
If I said you could make
one phone call,

422
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,094
who would you call?

423
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,179
Don't even say it.

424
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,015
Gervase, don't
even think it.

425
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,059
I'm going to call
Carmela, see how
the baby is.

426
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,435
ALL:
Yay!

427
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,353
All right, it's 3:00 A.M.
In Jersey right now.

428
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,397
We're not going
to call right now,

429
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,107
waste it when she's asleep,
may not answer.

430
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,401
Tomorrow morning,
I'll come back
over to Rattana,

431
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,861
I'll bring the phone,

432
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,279
we'll call home, talk to mom,
see how things are going.

433
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,406
Sounds good, Jeff.
You the man.

434
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,407
Way to go.

435
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,992
All right,
enjoy your pizza.

436
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,904
Let's walk along
this way.

437
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,497
RUDY:
<i>Ten more days--</i>
<i>it'll all be over.</i>

438
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:12,336
I'll probably never see
these people again.

439
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,755
The way I want it.

440
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,304
Going to make my phone call
to my family.

441
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,975
See how everybody's doing,
make sure they're doing good.

442
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,852
I certainly don't judge him

443
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,979
for being not married
and having kids.

444
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,148
I mean, he had one relationship,

445
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,775
and then he had another
relationship,

446
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,485
and he seems to be
in a relationship now

447
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,320
with a woman where he's had
two children,

448
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,030
<i>and is working toward</i>

449
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,449
<i>a committed, long-term</i>
<i>relationship</i>

450
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,827
<i>to parent those children</i>
<i>together.</i>

451
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,330
I don't agree with babies
out of wedlock

452
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,500
that kind of garbage, you know?

453
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,169
Half of the problem they got
in this country today,

454
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,004
there's no family life.

455
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,839
And then they're blaming
the schools.

456
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,466
It starts way before
them kids go to school.

457
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,554
They need a family.

458
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,849
They need somebody beating them
in the head.

459
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,356
(<i> cell phone dialing</i> )

460
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,360
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

461
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,361
CARMELA:
Hello?

462
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,570
Hello.

463
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,363

00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,490

I'm fine.

470
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,332
How's the baby?

471
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,418
I'm sitting here with him
in my arms

472
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,544
and Kayla's just kissing him.

473
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,214
Like, all she does
is play with his hair.

474
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,800
Does he have a lot of hair?

475
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,677
Oh, yeah? Like Kayla?

476
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,970
Or more than her?

477
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,263
You want to talk
to daddy?

478
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,389
Say, "Hi, daddy."

479
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:47,806
Daddy.

480
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,225
Hey, Kayla!

481

Daddy.

483
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,022
Yeah, give him a kiss,
say, "Bye-bye."

484
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,858
Tell him, say, "Bye-bye."

(<i> laughs</i> )

486
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,111
What, she's in shock?
It's been that long?

487
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,868
COLLEEN:
<i>I mean it's better</i>
<i>that he's not married,</i>

488
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,037
'cause he has
issues right now
with Carmela

489
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,997
and it's better
that they're not married

490
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,583
than just get married
and then have problems later on.

491
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,587
From talking to him the other
day, I kind of got the scoop,

492
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,881
and I'm sure you probably heard
a little more,

493
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,591
but the first girl he was with,

494
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,551
he really tried
to stay with her and everything

495
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,928
especially for the kids,

496
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,930
and she was kind of the one
who was just, like,

497
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,766
"Look, it's not going to work."

498
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,642
So, I think he-he's very
responsible with his kids.

499
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,020
He's paying for the kids.

500
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:35,562
He's spending time
with the kids.

501
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,106
He's being a dad.

502
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,152
It wouldn't be my choice,
but that's his,

503
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,987
and he's free to make that.

504
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,619
I really am so proud of you.

505
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,453
I can't believe there's
11 days left

506
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,622
and you are still in it.

507
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,417
I'm just trying to, uh,
finish it out.

508
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,919
I've taken care
of all your bills

509
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,462
and all that other stuff.

510
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,963
Well, let everybody know
I miss them.

511
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,631
Tell your mom I even miss her.

512
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,426
Yeah, unbelievable, isn't it?

513
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,137
I love you and Kay loves you
and Gunner loves you.

514
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,848
And, uh, so... you know.

515
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,642
I love you.
Tell Gunner I love him.

516
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,976
Tell Kay I love her.

517
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,520
All right.

518
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,616
Come on, let's see
how his phone call went.

519
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,034
Oh, he's here?

520
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,536
Oh, he's right there.

521
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,496
Tell us about
the whole situation.

522
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,163
Talk to Carmela?

523
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,498
Yeah, she's
doing good.

524
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,292
He's doing good,
everybody's
just doing great.

525
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,511
We seriously,

526
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,638
seriously lucked out.

527
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,431
I have no idea
what I would have done

528
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,891
had I ended up on Pagong
in the beginning.

529
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,892
Oh, me, too.

530
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,977
Committed suicide.

531
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,395
I'd have killed
somebody.

532
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,522
I could never have built
alliances

533
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,566
such solid ones,
particularly, too.

534
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,192
They're too flaky.

535
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,694
Changes with
the wind.

536
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,072
Too immature, yeah,
is what it is.

537
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,868
Like, Kelly's even
a little flaky,
at moments.

538
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,660
She's doing well, though.

539
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,661
Yeah.

540
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,538
I mean, for 22, she's amazing.

541
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,707
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

542
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,333
I hope she's solid.

543
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,549
KELLY:
<i>This is not what I thought</i>
<i>it was going to be like.</i>

544
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,134
<i>It's not about surviving</i>
<i>the elements.</i>

545
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,511
<i>It's about surviving yourself.</i>

546
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,222
<i>I didn't want to be a part</i>
<i>of the alliance</i>

547
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,808
because I thought it was
conniving and dirty
and untrue to myself.

548
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,397
GERVASE:
<i>I don't think Kelly really</i>
<i>wanted to make an alliance</i>

549
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,232
<i>with anybody here in Tagi.</i>

550
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,276
I think they kind of
strong-armed Kelly

551
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,196
into making an alliance
and joining their team,

552
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,614
and it's really affected her
personally, like,

553
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,491
as a tug-of-war on the inside.

554
00:24:55,452 --> 00:25:00,290
KELLY:
<i>It's not worth it to feel like</i>
<i>... for the rest of your life,</i>

555
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:04,044
um, for a little bit of money,
and your 15 minutes.

556
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,217
<i>You know, I kind of feel like</i>
<i>Luke Skywalker, or something.</i>

557
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,261
<i>I crossed over to the dark side</i>
<i>for a moment.</i>

558
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,764
<i>I don't like playing the game</i>
<i>that way.</i>

559
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,308
Does that feel like
Mm-hmm. your face okay?

560
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,643
KELLY:
<i>Making a deal with Rich</i>

561
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,562
<i>is kind of like making a deal</i>
<i>with the devil.</i>

562
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,772
Then you know how to use it
to breath, or no?

563
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,274
KELLY:
<i>I decided a while ago</i>

564
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,779
not to be part
of the big alliance.

565
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,780
It's automatic.

566
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,782
I don't know if I could do that.

567
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,950
You'd be surprised.

568
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,284
Like right now,
you are.

569
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,956
KELLY:
<i>I've been pretty much</i>
<i>letting Rich think</i>

570
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,794
that I'm still part of his
little mind-game, follower thing

571
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,296
<i>the whole time, basically,</i>
<i>because I figured</i>

572
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,424
<i>if I did tell him</i>
<i>that I grew a conscience</i>

573
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,302
<i>and I didn't want to be</i>
<i>his little follower anymore</i>

574
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,305
<i>that he would turn around</i>
<i>and shut me down,</i>

575
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,974
which I'm certain he would have,

576
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,059
<i>so, I'm glad I didn't tell him.</i>

577
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:06,106
RICHARD:
You're seeming more down
and more serious to me

578
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,107
toward the end.

579
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,108
Really?

580
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,109
Mm-hmm.

581
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,861
A lot more so than...
early on.

582
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,864
KELLY:
<i>Do I just kind of roll over</i>
<i>and let Rich decide</i>

583
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,825
<i>how it's all going to play out</i>

584
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,743
or do I try and beat him
at his own damn game?

585
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,914
Done.

586
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,338
Hey!

587
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,677
Wait, start at the beginning.

588
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:35,969
Did it start?

589
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,680
Yeah.

590
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,266
"Seeking immunity is
part of the game

591
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,560
"now you'll rely on
a flickering flame.

592
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,187

00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,981
<i>wait until sunset</i>
<i>and head to the beach."</i>

594
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,364
COLLEEN:
<i>Kelly is really hard for me</i>

595
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,910
to talk with about voting
and about alliances.

596
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,872
So smart,
they duped everybody.

597
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,082
<i>I mean, because she could</i>
<i>really be in</i>

598
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,834
<i>for forming an alliance</i>
<i>because you see her now</i>

599
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,004
being kind of
pulled back and
forth, you know?

600
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,589
In one way,
I think, she feels

601
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,549
<i>that she wants to, like,</i>
<i>have fun and be young</i>

602
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,925
<i>and, like, she said it.</i>

603
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,761
<i>She was just like,</i>
<i>"I can't believe</i>

604
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,888
<i>I'm in this group</i>
<i>with these people."</i>

605
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,389
<i>She's like, "It's awful."</i>

606
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,891
RICHARD:
I'm liking this breeze.

607
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,060
SEAN:
It's going to make
the contest harder.

608
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,977
Did you see the clue?

609
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,688
Over there.ue?

610
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,857
"Seeking immunity
is part of the game

611
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,236

614
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,577
Something at
night, man.

615
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,578
Yeah.

616
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,830
Some night,
night something.

617
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,867
Day 29--
what is there to say?

618
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,912
Nobody's happy
for anybody else
when they win

619
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,414
the immunity challenge.

620
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,456
At this point

621
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:28,957
nobody's safe
on that stage.

622
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,959
Everybody knows that.

623
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,002
This is go-for-broke time.

624
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,796
This game is designed
to figure out how much

625
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,048
you've learned
since you've been on the island.

626
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,925
We've picked this beach

627
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,635
'cause it has
a lot of driftwood.

628
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:41,928
The idea is building fire.

629
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,471
You'll have
three minutes

630
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,597
to go and collect
as much driftwood

631
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,932
and stack it.

632
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:46,975
You each have your own fire pit
and a weighted flag.

633
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,603
The second leg of the race,
take your staffs

634
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,022
go out in the water,
light them, come back here

635
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,858
use your torch
to light your fire.

636
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,653
The first person
to burn through this wick

637
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:03,324
drops this and raises that--
immunity.

638
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,702
Make sense?
Let's do it.

639
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,787
Take a spot.
This is one, two, three, four.

640
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,079
Should be seven of them.

641
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:15,962
Survivors, ready?

642
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,047
Go!

643
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,009
(<i> grunts</i> )

644
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,021
JEFF:
Two minutes!

645
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,158
Your branches cannot be touching
the wick.

646
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:49,078
They can be right under it,
but they can't be touching it.

647
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,039
Five, four...

648
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,374
three, two...

649
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,084
one.

650
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,507
Hold on to your staffs;
keep that thing above water.

651
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,967
Survivors, ready?!

652
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:03,927
Go!

653
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:48,930
JEFF:
Remember to light
from the base...

654
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,642
from the fire pit.

655
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,060
That's it, Richard.

656
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,270
Okay. I got you.

657
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,106
JEFF:
You got plenty of time, Gervase.

658
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,107
It's going to take
a long time

659
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,233
for these fires to burn.

660
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,648
Yeah!

661
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,150
Oh, good job, Rich.

662
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,776
I could cook some rice

663
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,487
over here, though,
if you want me to.

664
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,031
Immune!

665
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,496
GERVASE:
<i>Rich got lucky</i>
<i>and won his challenge</i>

666
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,081
and now he's... oh, man!

667
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,541
Wait till you see him now.

668
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,669
<i>If you watch Rich</i>
<i>the rest of this day</i>

669
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,795
<i>watch the arrogance</i>

670
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,130
<i>and the swagger</i>
<i>he's walking around with</i>

671
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,590
'cause he won that immunity

672
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,509
and he knows
he can't be touched tonight.

673
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,011
What, if anything,
should be said...

674
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,846
<i>I think Rich is</i>
<i>the ringleader..</i>

675
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,058
<i>Or if he's not the ringleader,</i>
<i>then he's second in command.</i>

676
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,561
<i>If I have to say,</i>
<i>"Do I know for a fact</i>

677
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,731
there's an alliance,
and all this stuff is going on?"

678
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,360
No, I don't know for a fact,
but I'm a smart guy, you know.

679
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,529
I can see things and see
how things are happening.

680
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,575
KELLY:
<i>I-I was talking to-to Colleen</i>

681
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,744
<i>and we were just, like,</i>
<i>"This sucks!"</i>

682
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,079
<i>You know,</i>
<i>especially for her and Gerv.</i>

683
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,915
It's like they know
they're leaving next

684
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,250
so they're just going
to sit around and wait

685
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,294
you know, with a red dot
pointed to their head?

686
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,339
You have to keep
your eye out.

687
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,091
Gervase, what
are you making?

688
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,386
I'm making costumes for tonight.

689
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,263
My code name for tonight...

690
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,598
is "bull's-eye."

691
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,352
I'm otherwise known
as "sitting duck."

692
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,896
(<i> snickering</i> )

693
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,107
GERVASE:
<i>I think Rich--</i>

694
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,317
being the cocky person
that he is--

695
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:53,072
will think that they can
get rid of me with three votes.

696
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:57,744
<i>Now, Sean approached me,</i>
<i>saying he wouldn't, uh, mind</i>

697
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,288
<i>making an alliance,</i>
<i>but he said</i>

698
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,289
<i>he would only do it</i>
<i>if Kelly joined us</i>

699
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,291
<i>so it'd be a sure thing.</i>

700
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,418
...bringing, like,
a bundle of sticks

701
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,669
and every morning...

702
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,296
<i>so they really only had</i>
<i>their three core people:</i>

703
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,631
<i>Rudy, Rich and Sue</i>

704
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,675
<i>who probably definitely</i>
<i>would be with the plan.</i>

705
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,344
That leaves four other votes,
including mine

706
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,931
that can go on somebody else.

707
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,683
<i>So somehow</i>
<i>we have to work on Kelly</i>

708
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,477
<i>and figure out</i>
<i>who she's voting for</i>

709
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,147
<i>and then maybe Colleen</i>
<i>can also vote for that person.</i>

710
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,149
So, the best bet is Kelly.

711
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,317
SUSAN:
Where's Kelly at?

712
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,527
I don't know.

713
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,115
KELLY:
<i>I wish something exciting</i>
<i>would happen--</i>

714
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,911
something shocking,
something that nobody expects.

715
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,331
Well, sh...

716
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,382
Looks like we got some
thunderheads building out there.

717
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,803
Should provide
for an exciting night.

718
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,399
We're preparing to, uh,
batten down the hatches.

719
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,151
(<i> whistling</i> )

720
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,653
SEAN:
There's going to
be a storm tonight.

721
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,538
(<i> thunder rolling</i> )

722
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,669
Kelly cut her own throat tonight

723
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,712
and it was a wonderful thing.

724
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,048
She, uh, tried to align herself

725
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,383
<i>to the kids her age</i>

726
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,677
<i>and was probably trying</i>
<i>to look a little nicer</i>

727
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,345
<i>to the other group,</i>
<i>but I have a feeling</i>

728
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,848
<i>she's got more going on</i>
<i>with them</i>

729
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,140
<i>than she's letting on.</i>

730
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,726
Whoo!

731
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,396
She doesn't realize
we can see it, right through it.

732
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,564
Yeah. Yeah.

733
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,731
Not smart at all.

734
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,567
Too much playing.

735
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,985
Yeah. That's not serious.

736
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,069
No.

737
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,195
It's serious for me.

738
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,197
Oh, it is for me, too.

739
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,240
RICHARD:
<i>It'll be interesting.</i>

740
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,410
<i>She could have consequences.</i>

741
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,787
We haven't decided yet.

742
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,371
"We." Hmm...

743
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,289
(<i> sniffs</i> )

744
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:27,268
(<i> conch shell blowing</i> )

745
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,103
(<i> gong sounding</i> )

746
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,236
we're going to go ahead
and bring our jury in

747
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,196
as you guys
are sitting down.

748
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,616
Okay.

749
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,950
Sean.

750
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,077
I got to revisit

751
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,454
the alphabet voting system

752
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,331
because it had
a dramatic effect

753
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,416
on the vote

754
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,628
because it resulted
in Jenna being ejected.

755
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,379
What were your
thoughts when
you left here?

756
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,465
Uh, when we went back to camp,
I was pretty much devastated.

757
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,927
Everyone was around...
we hung around by the campfire

758
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,511
and uh, both the
remaining Pagong people

759
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,347
and the remaining
Tagi people urged me

760
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,476
implored me to, uh, vote, um,
in my own best interest--

761
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,977
to get with the program.

762
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,103
In the immortal words

763
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,023
of Sue,
"to get some balls."

764
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,524
And that's what I plan to do
from here on out.

765
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,153
Kelly, we haven't talked much
about your strategy

766
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,321
in terms of voting.

767
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,822
You got to
have one at
this point.

768
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,823
Sure. Why not?

769
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,325
I think everybody does.

770
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,660
What is it?
What's it
based on?

771
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,371
It's based on who's competition
and who's pissing me off.

772
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,331
(<i> Colleen laughs</i> )

773
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,999
How about you, Colleen?

774
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,168
Actually, tonight I'd like to be
referred to as "sitting duck."

775
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,795
Yes, thank you.?

776
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,129
You feel as though
you might be

777
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:37,964
a target tonight?

778
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,840
Definitely.
I'm just waiting.

779
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,175
And that's based on what?

780
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,220
That's based on eyes and ears

781
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,515
and alliances and nonalliances.

782
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,516
Sue.

783
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,726
Um, we're all sitting here.

784
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,019
We're adults.

785
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:58,317
This is a game, but the game
also reflects a lot on real life

786
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,361
and you always bring up
this alliance thing.

787
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,530
Well, America is run
on alliance.

788
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,742
The minute somebody gives money
to the president

789
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,246
for his campaign as a lobbyist,
that's an alliance.

790
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,706
Don't tell me
he doesn't think

791
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,957
he doesn't owe
them anything,

792
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,874
'cause he does.

793
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,418
They help put him
where he's at.

794
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,545
Same thing goes
when people join a church

795
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,714
and they're not religious,

796
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,382
but they join the church

797
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,093
because they want to make
connections for, be it

798
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,553
they're an
insurance agent

799
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,013
and want to sell more
insurance in town,

800
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,014
or they're a
real estate agent

801
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,890
and they want to sell
real estate.

802
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,351
So they want to meet up
with people.

803
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,686
So there is going
to be alliance.

804
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,521
Don't tell me
there ain't an alliance.

805
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,565
Well, Tagi, we lived together
for 20 days

806
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,567
built a house, built a camp,
comfortable

807
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,570
totally happy with each other,
like we ain't going to have

808
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,405
some kind of
bonding there.

809
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,573
Yeah, there's going
to be alliances.

810
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,908
This is just a chess game.

811
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,410
It's the way life goes.

812
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,411
JEFF:
Richard.

813
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,746
According to
Colleen and Sue

814
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,080
there is
an alliance.

815
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,957
Is there? Geez...

816
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,710
is there a way to break
the alliance right now?

817
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,545
If you were looking at
this from the outside

818
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,922
is there a way
to break it?

819
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,424
I have no idea who is

820
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,676
completely trustworthy,
who isn't.

821
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,928
I think there's
always a way

822
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,597
that things
could break down.

823
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,098
(<i> sputters lips</i> )

824
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:11,682
Who knows what's going
to happen.

825
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,935
It's all a game.

826
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,146
All right, it's time to vote.

827
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:17,563
Gervase, you're up.

828
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,623
My vote is for Sean,

829
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,583
as Sean has made a huge mistake

830
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,335
in not seeing that
Tagi had an alliance

831
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,961
from day three on this island,

832
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,963
and he couldn't even
see anything happening.

833
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,341
So, for a smart guy,
he has no common sense,

834
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,718
no brains in his head, really,
when it comes down to it.

835
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,222
So Sean really deserves
this vote.

836
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,541
Hmm. I wonder how you spell it.

837
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,376
I don't know.

838
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:24,755
Anyways, you're a nice guy,
I wish you the best of luck...

839
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,217
but I'm tired of getting beat

840
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,221
at the competitions
by you, guy, so...

841
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,990
I think Sean was, uh--

842
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,033
I hope this is how
you spell your name--

843
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,578
pretty pathetic, this week
because, uh, first he goes,

844
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,289
"I'm looking out
for everybody's best interest,"

845
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,541
and now he's looking out
for his<i> own</i> interest.

846
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,585
I think if anybody should
get voted off this time

847
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,004
it should be him
without question.

848
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,255
He's a putz.

849
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,760
I'll go tally the votes.

850
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,570
Once the votes are tallied,
the decision is final.

851
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,071
The person will be asked

852
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,574
to leave the tribal council area
immediately.

853
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,492
I'll read the votes.

854
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,747
First vote...

855
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,208
"Sean."

856
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,176
"Sean."

857
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:54,845
"Gervase."

858
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:04,939
"Gervase."

859
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,692
Two votes
for Gervase;

860
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,945
two votes for Sean.

861
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,117
"Gervase."

862
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,001
"Gervase."

863
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,461
I won't read
the last vote.

864
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,545
It's irrelevant.

865
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,380
Gervase...

866
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,132
I need you to bring
me your staff.

867
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,897
The tribe has spoken.

868
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,320
It's time for
you to go.

869
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,531
Bye.

870
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,758
JEFF:
Well, you have
survived another one.

871
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,302
We're down to six

872
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,012
getting close
to our final two.

873
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,680
You guys can head back to camp.

874
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,806
See you tomorrow.

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Next week, on</i> Survivor:

878
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,376
<i>One castaway wins</i>
<i>a night of luxury.</i>

879
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:49,877
JEFF:
<i>One night, on a yacht--</i>

880
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,962
that yacht.

881
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,549
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And as the end draws near,</i>
<i>alliances waver.</i>

00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:57,718
COLLEEN:
<i>I'm getting to see</i>
<i>the breakdown</i>

883
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,219
<i>of the Tagi alliance.</i>

884
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,721
When I turn around
and see somebody

885
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,889
starting to dig a knife
into my backside

886
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,849
it just really pisses me off.

887
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,233
First off, I'd like to say
that I don't have...

888
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,361
hold any, like...
ill feelings

889
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,112
<i>towards Rich and Sue</i>
<i>and anybody in Tagi</i>

890
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,824
<i>for making an alliance</i>
<i>and picking us off one by one.</i>

891
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,744
<i>It's just that my tribe</i>
<i>didn't want to do that.</i>

892
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,871
<i>They wanted to keep it</i>
<i>as an open game--</i>

893
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,748
<i>fair is fair, and let</i>
<i>the best person end up winning</i>

894
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,042
the million dollars.
