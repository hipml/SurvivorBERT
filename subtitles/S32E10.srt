1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:07,257
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR"... AFTER A MEETING,

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:16,099
JASON, SCOT AND TAI WERE ON THE
BOTTOM.

3
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,810
>> IT'S TIME TO COME OUT.

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:23,940
>> Meaghan: JULIA SAW IT AS A
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO GET

5
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,108
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,777
>> GETTING RID OF YOU GUYS WOULD
BE A DUMB MOVE ON MY PART.

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,280
>> Jeff: BUT EVERYONE NOTICED
JULIA WAS PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:36,119
>> JULIA WANTS TO RIDE THE
MIDDLE TO THE END.

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:40,790
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
DEBBIE EXPOSED THE PLAN IN FRONT

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,916
OF JULIA.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,337
>> DEBBIE COMPLETELY TRUSTS
JEWELA.

12
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,297
THAT SCARES ME.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,424
>> Jeff: AND IT PUT A TARGET
ON DEBBIE'S BACK.

14
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,093
>> DO I HAVE TO CUT DEBBIE
LOOSE?

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:52,761
I'M READY.

16
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,471
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL...

17
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,265
>> I'VE GOT AN IDOL.

18
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,309
THE IDOL'S GOT A BROTHER.

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,813
>> Jeff: JASON, SCOT AND TAI
SHOWED OFF THEIR IDOLS.

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,442
>> I'M GIVING MY IDOL TO TAI.

21
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:13,114
>> Jeff: AND WERE PREPARED TO
PLAY THE SUPER IDOL, WHICH GAVE

22
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,409
THE MAJORITY MORE REASON TO VOTE
OUT ONE OF THEIR OWN.

23
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,828
DEBBIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

24
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,788
EIGHT ARE LEFT.

25
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:33,384
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

26
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,347
>> THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

27
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,184
THE ONLY WAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER IF CYDNEY HAD GONE HOME,

28
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,019
BUT THEY ATE ONE OF THEIR OWN.

29
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:43,686
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,855
TRIBAL WAS EXCITING.

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,318
THE BOYS ARE HAPPY BECAUSE NONE
OF US WENT HOME, NONE OF US USED

32
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,696
OUR IDOLS, SO WE THINK TRIBAL
WENT VERY WELL.

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,198
>> I AM GIVING YOUR IDOL BACK.

34
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:00,036
>> I WILL ACCEPT IT AND I THANK
YOU SO MUCH.

35
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,746
>> PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATION.

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,914
IT WORKED.

37
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,876
AND ALL WE DID WAS HIDE A
MACHETE AND AN AX AND PUT A FIRE

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,502
OUT.

39
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,920
AND THEY COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

40
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,088
WE CAUSED CHAOS.

41
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,383
IT FRACTURED THEM, AND IT MADE
THEM GET RAID OF THEIR OWN.

42
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,344
WE MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE
PERSON HOME THAT WE WANTED, BUT

43
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,554
ALL THREE OF US STAYED.

44
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:23,434
WE GOT JULIA ON OUR SIDE, AND WE
STILL HAVE THE SUPER IDOL.

45
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:32,402
THAT'S A WIN IN MY BOOK.

46
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,572
>> I'M BEYOND GOOD.

47
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,030
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

48
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,199
THAT'S A START.

49
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,619
>> I WOULD LOVE TO GET CAMP LIFE
BACK TOGETHER.

50
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,080
IT'S ALL ABOUT MENDING
RELATIONSHIPS AGAIN.

51
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,374
I THINK WE NEED TO SAY, YOU
KNOW, OLIVE BRANCH IS THERE.

52
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,458
YOU GOT TO START SOMEWHERE.

53
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:55,592
>> WE HAVE TO TALK TO AUBRY AND
SEE WHAT HER... I WANT

54
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,092
ASSURANCES.

55
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,261
>>
I CAME INTO THIS

56
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:04,309
GAME NOT WANTING TO BE THE GRUFF
MAN KICKING OVER THE RICE AND

57
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,228
POURING WATER ON THE FIRE LIKE I
DID, BUT I HAD TO MAKE A POINT

58
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,439
THAT WE WERE THE PROVIDERS AND
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO EAT AND

59
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,276
SUCCEED WITHOUT US.

60
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,154
>> WE ENJOY GETTING WOOD,
GETTING THE WATER, GETTING ALL

61
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,281
THIS STUFF.

62
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,325
I WANT... MY REAL BEEF IS WITH
CYDNEY.

63
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,161
SHE BETRAYED US FOR NO REASON,
SO WE WANT CYDNEY GONE.

64
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:28,124
IF WE FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON BOARD
WITH THAT IDEA, EVERYTHING WILL

65
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:28,958
GO AS NORMAL.

66
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,127
>> NOW WE'RE BEING THE BIGGER
PEOPLE.

67
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,462
WE'RE SHOWING OUR MATURITY.

68
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,799
WE'RE SHOWING THAT WE CAN COME
BACK IN AND BE LIKE NOTHING

69
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,967
HAPPENED.

70
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,469
HOPEFULLY CYDNEY CONTINUES TO
SHOW EVERYBODY WHO SHE REALLY

71
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,388
IS, WHICH IS BROODING, PETTY,
SMALL.

72
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,140
>> WE WANT A HAPPY CAMP.

73
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,435
>> OKAY.

74
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,437
IT'S A LOT FIRST THING IN THE
MORNING.

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,941
SCOT WAS TELLING ME CAMP LIFE
WILL BE NORMAL IF HE GETS WHAT

76
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,650
HE WANTS.

77
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,026
IT WAS A SOFT, CONTROLLING MOVE.

78
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,821
IT WAS HIM TELLING ME WHAT HE
WANTS, AND WHAT I WILL GET IN

79
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:04,452
RETURN, BUT IT WAS SERVED UP
WITH A BIRTHDAY CAKE THAT WAS

80
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,873
VERY SUGARY TO MAKE IT SEEM A
LITTLE LESS COME NEARING.

81
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,500
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DEMAND
ANYTHING FROM YOU RIGHT NOW.

82
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,169
I DON'T NEED A PROMISE.

83
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,337
I NEED YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT.

84
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,339
>> NEW YORK IT'S DEFINITE.

85
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,884
THERE WAS IN THE A SHOT IN HELL
I'M GOING TO WORK WITH THEM, BUT

86
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,179
I'M WILLING TO LET THEM THINK
I'LL PLAY ALONG, AND WHEN IT

87
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:27,892
COMES TIME TO GET OUT SCOT, I'M
READY THE FIGHT, BUT IT'S A BIG,

88
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:33,231
SCARY MOVE.

89
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,565
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.

90
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,361
We go further, so you can.

91
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:11,894
(<i> THEME SONG PLAYING</i> )
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

92
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:17,900
(<i> THEME SONG PLAYING</i> )
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

93
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,901
ALL RIGHT.

94
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,237
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,405
>> YEAH.

96
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,906
>> Jeff: VERY SIMPLE: FOR
TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'LL PLACE

97
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,410
ONE FOOT AT THE END OF A
BALANCING BEAM.

98
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,038
AT THE OTHER END, CERAMIC POTS.

99
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,625
WHEN THE POTS DROP, YOU'RE OUT.

100
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,544
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
REWARD.

101
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,088
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

102
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,257
>> YEP.

103
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,259
>> Jeff: TODAY IT'S SOMETHING
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

104
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,385
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

105
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:49,932
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PLAY FOR FOOD
IN THE FORM OF A BACON

106
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,644
CHEESEBURGER, FRENCH FRIES, COLD
BEER AND CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES

107
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,064
FOR DESSERT.

108
00:05:56,147 --> 00:06:01,611
OR IF YOU WANT TO NOURISH YOUR
SOUL, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PLAY FOR

109
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,862
LOVE.

110
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,615
THESE ARE THE LETTERS WRITTEN BY
THE VERY PEOPLE YOU ARE OUT HERE

111
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,866
PLAYING FOR.

112
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,577
THIS COULD BE JUST WHAT YOU NEED
TO GET YOU THROUGH THESE LAST

113
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,246
FEW DAYS.

114
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,834
OR IF YOU FEEL YOU'RE IN
TROUBLE, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PLAY

115
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,795
FOR ADVANTAGE.

116
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,798
THE SPECIFICS OF THE ADVANTAGE
WILL REMAIN A MYSTERY.

117
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,633
ALL YOU KNOW IS THIS WILL HELP
YOU IN THE GAME.

118
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,470
HERE'S THE TWIST: SO YOU ARE ALL
COMPETING IN THE SAME CHALLENGE.

119
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:32,642
YOU ARE ONLY COMPETING AGAINST
THE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE THE SAME

120
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,810
REWARD.

121
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:38,481
SO IT BECOMES A CASE OF WHAT DO
I NEED VERSUS WHAT DO I WANT

122
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,860
VERSUS WHAT DO I THINK EVERYBODY
ELSE IS GOING TO CHOOSE.

123
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,863
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO CHOOSE YOUR
REWARD IN SECRET AND GET

124
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:51,619
STARTED.

125
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,871
WE HAVE OUR MATCHUPS.

126
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:58,960
GOING FOR ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME,
IT IS TAI, CYDNEY AND AUBRY.

127
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:03,506
CHOOSING FOOD, IT IS SCOT VERSUS
JASON VERSUS MICHELE.

128
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,635
AND CHOOSING LOVE, IT IS JULIA
VERSUS JOE.

129
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:11,681
SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BEAT
THE PEOPLE IN YOUR CATEGORY.

130
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,017
SO WE WILL HAVE THREE WINNERS IN
THIS CHALLENGE.

131
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,686
ALL RIGHT.

132
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:24,193
EVERYBODY PLACE YOUR FOOT ON
YOUR BEAM.

133
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:24,735
GENTLY.

134
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:29,991
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

135
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,326
YOU CAN'T TOUCH THE STRUCTURE.

136
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,916
IT'S ALL ABOUT BALANCE, STAYING
FOCUSED.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,376
JOE, A LITTLE TROUBLE OUT OF THE
GATE.

138
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,711
>> I'M SHAKY.

139
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,920
I'M SHAKY.

140
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,592
>> Jeff: ALL JULIA HAS TO DO
IS BEAT JOE TO GET THOSE LETTERS

141
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,135
FROM HOME, AND THAT'S IT.

142
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,303
JOE IS OUT.

143
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,013
JOE, TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

144
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,931
JULIA, YOU'RE DONE.

145
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,685
JULIA THE FIRST WINNER IN THIS
CHALLENGE, THE LOVE LETTER.

146
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,771
YOU MIGHT WANT THE WAIT UNTIL
YOU GET BACK TO CAMP.

147
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:08,196
NOW IT IS DOWN TO ADVANTAGE
BETWEEN TAI, CYDNEY AND AUBRY,

148
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,910
AND FOOD BETWEEN SCOT, JASON AND
MICHELE.

149
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:18,080
LOTS OF STRATEGY IN THE CHOICES
EVERYBODY MADE.

150
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,582
IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN BEAT
SOMEBODY, THEN GO FOR SOMETHING

151
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:24,754
THAT YOU THINK NOBODY ELSE WILL
CHOOSE.

152
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,048
JASON STRUGGLING BUT GETS IT
BACK UNDER CONTROL.

153
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,218
A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT IS
OKAY, AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN

154
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:35,598
CRIMINAL OF IT.

155
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,767
SCOT, A LITTLE BIT OF
HESITATION.

156
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,601
HE'S OUT.

157
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,602
NO SHOT AT FOOD.

158
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,606
IT'S NOW DOWN TO JASON VERSUS
MICHELE FOR FOOD.

159
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,108
DON'T START DAYDREAMING.

160
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,276
STAY FOCUSED.

161
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,405
IF YOU LOSE YOUR CONCENTRATION
FOR ONE MOMENT, YOU'RE OUT.

162
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:56,285
THOSE POTS WILL DROP.

163
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,121
HERE COMES THE WIND NOW.

164
00:08:59,205 --> 00:08:59,747
BIG BREEZE.

165
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,624
AUBRY WITH SOME MOVEMENT.

166
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,169
JASON ALL OVER THE PLACE NOW,
BUT HE'S STILL IN IT.

167
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,796
BUT HE CAN'T DO IT.

168
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,798
JASON IS OUT.

169
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,466
MICHELE WINS FOOD.

170
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,676
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

171
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,387
>> Jeff: HAVE A SEAT, MICHELE.

172
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,971
I'LL BRING IT TO YOU.

173
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,846
>> THANK YOU.

174
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,723
>> Jeff: WE ARE DOWN TO OUR
LAST THREE.

175
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:24,355
OUR LAST WINNER WILL BE EITHER
TAI, CYDNEY OR AUBRY GOING FOR

176
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:24,689
ADVANTAGE.

177
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,648
>> ENJOY.

178
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,608
>> I THINK I'M GOING WITH THE
COOKIE FIRST.

179
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,776
>> GOOD JOB, MICHELE.

180
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,987
>> Jeff: JULIA HAS WON LETTERS
FROM HOME.

181
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,822
MICHELE HAS WON FOOD.

182
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:43,499
BUT THIS MAY BE THE REWARD WITH
THE MOST LONG-TERM VALUE.

183
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:47,712
TAI, CYDNEY LOOKING VERY GOOD.

184
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,048
AUBRY WAVERING AGAIN.

185
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:56,846
THIS COULD BE WHAT YOU NEED TO
GET TO THE END.

186
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,972
YOU DON'T KNOW.

187
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,890
A SILLY LITTLE CHALLENGE THAT
COULD BE WORTH $1 MILLION.

188
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:04,854
CYDNEY GETTING A LITTLE HIGHER.

189
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:09,025
AUBRY WITH A LOT OF MOVEMENT.

190
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,485
OUT OF NOWHERE CYDNEY DROPS.

191
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,361
>> WOW.

192
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,363
>> Jeff: CYDNEY HAS NO SHOT AT
ADVANTAGE.

193
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,907
WE ARE NOW DOWN TO TAI AND
AUBRY.

194
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:21,203
>> GOOD JOB, CYDNEY.

195
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,913
>> Jeff: THE LAST TWO PEOPLE
IN THIS CHALLENGE GOING FOR

196
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,873
ADVANTAGE.

197
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,708
>> JEFF, I JUST WANT THE PROVE
IT TO MYSELF.

198
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,252
>> Jeff: SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT
THE ADVANTAGE?

199
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,214
>> THIS IS ABOUT PROVING MYSELF
THAT THIS IS A HARD-ASS GAME AND

200
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,719
I CAN DO IT.

201
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,263
>> Jeff: DO NOT LOSE YOUR
CONCENTRATION.

202
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,766
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING TO KEEP
CONTROL OVER YOUR BODY, KEEP

203
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:47,688
DOING IT.

204
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,567
PROBABLY SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
OUT HERE FOR A LONG TIME.

205
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,987
IT HAS ONLY BEEN TEN MINUTES.

206
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,740
TAI WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
MOVEMENT.

207
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:02,745
AUBRY WITH A LITTLE MOVEMENT.

208
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,789
THOSE THIGHS HAVE TO BE BURNING.

209
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,040
THE WHOLE IDEA OF DIG DEEP.

210
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,878
NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT.

211
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,215
TAI WITH A LITTLE MOVEMENT.

212
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,383
YOU HAVE TO STAY ALERT.

213
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,926
STAY ALERT.

214
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,553
ANOTHER NICE SAVE BY AUBRY.

215
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,224
TAI STRUGGLING MORE.

216
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,060
HERE COMES THAT BREEZE AGAIN.

217
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,897
AUBRY FIGHTING TO STAY IN IT.

218
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,942
AUBRY IS OUT.

219
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,822
TAI WINS INDIVIDUAL REWARD IN
THE FORM OF ADVANTAGE.

220
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,282
>> GOOD JOB, AUBRY.

221
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:45,955
>> Jeff: ANOTHER BIG SHOWDOWN
THIS SEASON.

222
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:46,831
TAI, YOUR ADVANTAGE.

223
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,625
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

224
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,835
>> Jeff: TAKE IT BACK TO CAMP.

225
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,962
FIND A PRIVATE SPOT, OPEN IT AND
READ IT.

226
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,799
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GRAB YOUR
STUFF.

227
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,466
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

228
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,634
>> SO TAI WINS THE ADVANTAGE.

229
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,262
THAT'S THE BEST THING THAT COULD
HAVE HAPPENED FOR OUR LITTLE

230
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,013
ALLIANCE, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
CYDNEY DIDN'T WIN ADVANTAGE.

231
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,891
CYDNEY DIDN'T EAT, AND CYDNEY
GOES HOME.

232
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:26,579
>> WOW.

233
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,623
>> THAT WAS A HUGE BURGER.

234
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,876
>> I WAS TRYING TO SHOVE THE
FOOD IN MY MOUTH, BUT I DIDN'T

235
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,881
WANT THE MAKE ANYONE WAIT, SO I
WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT.

236
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,009
IT FELT SO GOOD TO BEAT SCOT AND
JASON, BECAUSE I KNOW THEY

237
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,011
WANTED THAT BURGER MORE THAN
ANYTHING.

238
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,722
>> YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING ELSE
WHILE WE'RE OUT?

239
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,976
>> I'M DYING OF THIRST, BUT I'LL
EAT THIS FIRST.

240
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,022
>> IT'S A LITTLE NERVE-RACKING
THAT TAI WON AN ADVANTAGE,

241
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,899
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HE HAS
AN IDOL.

242
00:12:54,982 --> 00:13:01,530
AND IT'S SCARY.

243
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,283
>> THE MOAT SAY GO THE TREE
MAIL.

244
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,620
MY IDOL RIGHT NOW IS KIND OF OUT
IN THE OPEN.

245
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,873
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE AN
ADVANTAGE THAT WAS LIKE HIDDEN

246
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,251
AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW I HAVE IT.

247
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,670
JUST LIKE ANYTHING, THE MORE
PEOPLE KNOW, THE LESS POWER IT

248
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,547
HAS.

249
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,426
OH, CONGRATULATIONS, YOU WON
YOURSELF AN EXTRA VOTE.

250
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,886
WOW.

251
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,014
I OPEN UP THE BOX, AND THE BOX
SAY YOU HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE.

252
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,557
FANTASTIC.

253
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,725
AN EXTRA VOTE.

254
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,686
THAT'S A LOT OF POWER, AND I CAN
PLAY IT ANY TIME UNTIL UP TO

255
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,896
FIVE PEOPLE ARE LEFT.

256
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,189
YEAH.

257
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,190
I FOUND AN IDOL.

258
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,858
I HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE.

259
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,277
AND I'M SCARED OF WHAT'S THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.

260
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:45,241
IT'S A RICH MAN'S PROBLEM, BUT I
HAVE TO TRUST MYSELF.

261
00:13:45,324 --> 00:14:00,047
OTHERWISE I MIGHT GO HOME WITH
BOTH OF THEM IN MY POCKET.

262
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,215
>> THAT WAS FUNNY.

263
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,927
>> I'VE KIND OF GONE ON THIS
ROLLER COASTER THROUGHOUT THIS

264
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,136
GAME.

265
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,266
I'M KIND OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO
GET POWER, TO GETTING POWER TO

266
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,270
LOSING POWER WHEN I WENT TO
BRAWN BEACH, COMING BACK AND

267
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,940
HAVING A LOVE LETTER GIVES YOU
THAT BOOST THE KEEP GOING

268
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,943
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S WHO
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR.

269
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:26,073
EVERY DAY KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN
OUR HEARTS, SO HANG TIGHT AND BE

270
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,993
FIERCE BECAUSE YOU KNOW OUR LOVE
RUNS SO DEEP AND IT GROWS EVERY

271
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,286
DAY.

272
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,997
AND HAVE THE GREATEST
SOUL-SEARCHING EXPERIENCE OF A

273
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,664
LIFETIME.

274
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,458
OH, MY GOD, I'M GOING THE CRY.

275
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,543
TRY NOT THE CRY.

276
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,336
BUT IT KEEPS YOU GOING.

277
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,965
AND IT WAS KIND OF A MOMENT FOR
ME TO STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT

278
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,093
I'M HERE THE PLAY AND THE GOAL
IS TO WIN.

279
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:52,141
AND TO DO THAT, I HAVE TO MAKE
BIG MOVES.

280
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,852
COMING OUT AND SAYING THAT THEY
HAVE THE IDOLS WAS SO DUMB.

281
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,312
>> NOT THE SMARTEST THING.

282
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,772
>> THOSE IDOLS CANNOT BE AROUND.

283
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,442
AND TAI GOT AN ADVANTAGE TODAY.

284
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,484
>> THAT SCARES ME.

285
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,986
>> THAT SCARES ME, TOO.

286
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,154
>> TAI IS DEFINITELY A THREAT AT
THIS POINT.

287
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:09,825
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS FLUSH
OUT THESE IDOL, BUT ALSO STAY

288
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,577
LOYAL TO MY ALLIANCE WITH JASON
AND SCOT.

289
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,041
>> THIS IS THE THING, IF WE ALL
VOTE TAI AND TAI DOESN'T MY AN

290
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,834
IDOL, TAI IS OUT.

291
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,837
IF HE PLAYS AN IDOL, CYDNEY IS
GONE BECAUSE THE THREE OF THEM

292
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,464
ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR CYDNEY.

293
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,550
AND THEN WE HAVE AN IDOL FLUSHED
OUT.

294
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,677
>> GET THAT DAMN IDOL OUT.

295
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,137
I THINK THAT'S...

296
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,849
>> I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLAN,
BECAUSE HE'LL GET NERVOUS AND

297
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,558
PLAY IT.

298
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,352
>> THE THREE GUYS HAVE TWO
IDOLS.

299
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,519
THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM.

300
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:42,149
AND WE GOT TO FLUSH OUT THE
IDOLS AND WE GOT TO GET RID OF

301
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,234
THE GUYS, ONE OR THE OTHER.

302
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,404
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE TAI DOES
NOT WIN IMMUNITY.

303
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,866
>> THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD WAY TO
GET THEM ALL OUT OF THE GAME.

304
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,035
>> JULIA WANTS TO THROW ALL THE
VOTES AT TAI AT NEXT TRIBAL AND

305
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,871
MAKE HOUR THE IDOL GOES.

306
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:58,832
JULIA IS DUE POLICE US THE, BUT
AT THE SAME TIME, SHE'S PLAYING

307
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,501
A GOOD GAME.

308
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,046
I CAN RESPECT THAT.

309
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,048
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT HER
NEXT TO ME.

310
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,677
SHE'S SUPER SHADY, AND PEOPLE
LIKE MICHELE DON'T SEE THROUGH

311
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,012
IT.

312
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,349
I THINK JULIA IS GOING TO WAIT
UNTIL THE NUMBERS ARE PERFECT

313
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,809
AND SHE'LL TAKE OUT THE GIRLS.

314
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,896
IF I HAVE TO TURN ON HER, I'M
NOT AFRAID TO GET MY HANDS

315
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,189
DIRTY.

316
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,046
>> YEAH.

317
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,218
>> I SAT CRYING IN THE GRASS
HERE SAYING, I DON'T KNOW IF I

318
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,177
COULD STILL PLAY THIS GAME.

319
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,306
>> I THINK THAT EVERY NIGHT WHEN
I GO TO SLEEP.

320
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,225
EVERYBODY IS PLAYING BETTER THAN
ME.

321
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,435
WHAT AM I DOING.

322
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:04,648
>> OUT HERE, I REALLY STRUGGLE
WITH PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

323
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,942
OTHER PEOPLE, ALL THE LYING, ALL
THE CHEATING.

324
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,111
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF, IT'S A
GAME.

325
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,239
BUT IT SEEMS REALLY DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO DO THAT.

326
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,326
>> IT'S THE HEART AND THE BRAIN
CONSTANTLY FIGHTING, ALL DAY

327
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,619
LONG, IN THIS GAME.

328
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,289
AND SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO KNOW
WHEN TO TRUST THE BRAIN AND WHEN

329
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,291
TO TRUST THE HEART AND WHEN TO
STOP THINKING.

330
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,670
>> MY HEART SAY, I LIKE THAT
GIRL AUBRY A LOT.

331
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,173
OUT HERE, MOST PEOPLE I DON'T
HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WITH, BUT

332
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,259
SHE HAS A CERTAIN ENERGY THAT I
REALLY LIKE.

333
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:37,389
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK
AT SOME POINT BECAUSE CERTAIN

334
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,310
GIRLS WANT TO PUSH THE VOTE TO
TRY TO GET IDOLS OUT.

335
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,561
>> UH-HUH.

336
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:49,651
>> I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU, AND
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU CAN

337
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:49,985
TRUST ME.

338
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:50,819
>> OKAY.

339
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,362
>> THAT I COULD HAVE YOUR BACK
ON THIS.

340
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,241
>> I WENT OUT ON A LIMB TALKING
TO TAI.

341
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,329
BUT I WANTED TAI TO KNOW THAT
JULIA'S GUNNING FOR HIM, AND I

342
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,876
AM ABALTERNATIVE TO THE WAY
JASON AND SCOT AND JULIA ARE

343
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,045
PLAYING THIS GAME.

344
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:13,675
SO MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT WORK AND
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON.

345
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,053
>> I'M EXCITED AUBRY IS ON MY
SIDE.

346
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,765
I THINK SHE'S A GOOD
CONTRIBUTION TO THE ALLIANCE.

347
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,517
TOGETHER WE COULD BE A GREAT
PARTNERSHIP.

348
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,853
I THINK SCOT AND JASON ARE GOING
THE LIKE IT.

349
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:32,152
IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN
EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL.

350
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,364
SO THIS MORNING AUBRY SAY SOME
GIRLS WANT YOUR IDOL GONE, AND

351
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,535
SHE THINKS SHE'S OPEN IF WE WANT
TO JOIN FORCES.

352
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,037
AND SHE SAID, WELL, I AM A FREE
AGENT.

353
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,372
I'M FREE, OPEN TO ANY
SUGGESTIONS IF YOU WANT TO TALK.

354
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:51,672
>> HOW ABOUT THIS IDEA: AT NEXT
TRIBAL WE TAKE AUBRY OUT.

355
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,339
>> THIS ONE?

356
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,257
>> THE NEXT ONE.

357
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,301
>> SEEMS LIKE I HAVE NO SAY IN
OUR ALLIANCE.

358
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,013
I'M NOT PART OF THE DISCUSSION.

359
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,226
I ALWAYS PARTICIPATE, BUT SEEMS
LIKE THEY'RE SO FORCEFUL.

360
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,436
>> THE SMARTEST OPTION IS TO GET
AUBRY OUT.

361
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,604
>> I SAY WE DO IT.

362
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,398
>> BREAK HER AND JOE UP.

363
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,568
THEN WE HAVE ALL THE POWER.

364
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,444
THE DOWNSIDE IS WE HAVE TO KEEP
CYDNEY AROUND, WHICH I HATE

365
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,571
DOING.

366
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,740
AS MUCH AS I HATE IT, IT'S THE
LAST THING THEY'LL EXPECT

367
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,367
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE WANT CYDNEY
OUT SO BAD.

368
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,243
>> I LIKE IT.

369
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,453
>> THOSE TWO BOYS ARE RUNNING
THE SHOW.

370
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,373
THAT'S WHY I'M FEELING A BIT
LIKE AN OUTSIDER.

371
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,292
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO?

372
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,419
>> SHE WON'T SUSPECT IT.

373
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,256
WE BLINDSIDE HER, BAM, AUBRY
GOES HOME.

374
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,302
THIS PLAN WORKS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN JUST GOING BLINDLY AT

375
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,054
CYDNEY BECAUSE IT WAS AN
EMOTIONAL DECISION.

376
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,057
AS LONG AS TAI AND JASON AND
MYSELF REMAIN FAITHFUL, WHICH I

377
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,144
DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULDN'T, WE
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD PATH TO GET

378
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:51,064
TO THE FINAL THREE, SO WE JUST
NEED TO MAKE SURE AUBRY DOESN'T

379
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:59,323
WIN IMMUNITY.

380
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:12,085
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

381
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,128
ALL RIGHT.

382
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,172
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

383
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:15,797
>> YES, SIR.

384
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,758
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST.

385
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,344
JULIA, TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

386
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,805
THANK YOU.

387
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,683
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

388
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,645
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO STRETCH YOUR ARMS OUT

389
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:34,983
AND USE YOUR FINGERTIPS TO PRESS
AGAINST TWO WOODEN DISKS.

390
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,444
ATTACHED TO THE DISKS, CERAMIC
POTS.

391
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,781
THE POTS DROP, YOU'RE OUT.

392
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:47,162
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN

393
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,831
SEVEN SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.

394
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,962
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE
AFTER 27 DAYS SOMEBODY WILL

395
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,340
BECOME THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.

396
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,174
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

397
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:08,725
WE'LL GET STARTED.

398
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,476
ALL RIGHT.

399
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,186
EVERYBODY IS IN POSITION.

400
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:16,358
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

401
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,570
IT IS DESIGNED TO MAKE YOUR
FINGERS FEEL NUMB FAIRLY

402
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,780
QUICKLY.

403
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:25,492
YOU HAVE JUST ENOUGH THAT YOU
CAN KEEP PRESSURE ON THE DISKS

404
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:30,205
BUT NOT SO MUCH THAT YOU CAN
JUST PUT YOUR ENTIRE PALM OR

405
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,415
YOUR FIST UP AGAINST THERE.

406
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,583
WHEN YOUR SHOULDERS AND YOUR
ARMS START THE WEAR OUT, YOU'LL

407
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:41,717
DROP.

408
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,553
JOE STANDING STRAIGHT, TRYING
THE HOLD STRONG.

409
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:49,725
YOU CAN FEEL THE PAIN.

410
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,684
JOE DROPS.

411
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,394
JOE IS THE FIRST PERSON OUT OF
THIS CHALLENGE.

412
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,730
SPOT ON THE BENCH.

413
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,107
VULNERABLE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

414
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,069
WE ARE NOW DOWN TO SEVEN.

415
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:06,241
ONE OF THE GREATEST FEELINGS IN
THIS GAME IS TO WALK INTO TRIBAL

416
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:07,617
KNOWING, I CAN'T BE VOTED OUT.

417
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:20,589
THIS COULD BE THE CHALLENGE THAT
SAVES YOU OR DOOMS YOU.

418
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,052
BY NOW YOU'RE DEFINITELY FEELING
IT IN YOUR SHOULDERS.

419
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,764
YOUR FINGERTIPS ARE STARTING TO
GO NUMB IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY.

420
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,557
PEOPLE CHANGING POSITIONS,
STANDING UP STRAIGHT, BENDING

421
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,101
OVER, LEAKINGED TO RIGHT.

422
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,480
AUBRY DOING SOME SORT OF 50s
DANCE CRAZE.

423
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:40,984
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP THAT
BODY ALIVE AND THAT BLOOD

424
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:45,447
MOVING, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO
DO.

425
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,991
JULIA SLIPS BUT A NICE RECOVERY.

426
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:52,621
SHE GETS IT BACK IN PLAY.

427
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,375
SCOT DROPS.

428
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:07,427
SCOT IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE,
AND WE ARE DOWN TO SIX.

429
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,303
JULIA'S NOW OUT.

430
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:08,970
>> MY THUMBS.

431
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:13,308
>> Jeff: WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.

432
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,519
EVERYBODY STARTING TO LOOK AT
EVERYBODY ELSE NOW.

433
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,814
A SURE SIGN THAT THE PAIN IS
THERE.

434
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,774
WONDERING, IS ANYBODY ELSE
HURTING.

435
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:25,153
YEAH, THEY ARE.

436
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:30,992
TAI SLIPPING WITH HIS LEFT DISK
A LITTLE BIT.

437
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,829
NOW TAI SLIPPING ON THE OTHER
SIDE.

438
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,833
TAI DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO LOSING
ONE OR BOTH POTS.

439
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,167
HE'S ON THE EDGE RIGHT NOW.

440
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,172
CAN HE GET IT BACK.

441
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,508
TAI IS OUT.

442
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,176
TAI HAS NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

443
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,344
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

444
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,596
WE ARE DOWN TO FOUR.

445
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,517
MICHELE FIGHTING TO STAY IN
THIS.

446
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,521
MICHELE CANNOT HANG ON ANY
LONGER.

447
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,480
MICHELE IS OUT.

448
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,815
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

449
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,692
WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.

450
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:18,874
ONE BRAIN, TWO BRAWN, ONE
NECKLACE.

451
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:23,044
EVERYBODY'S FINGERTIPS ARE
SUFFICIENTLY GONE AT THIS POINT.

452
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:28,592
ANOTHER HOT, MUGGY DAY.

453
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,344
JASON CONTINUES TO FIGHT.

454
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:40,270
YOU CAN FEEL YOUR MUSCLES
STARTING TO GIVE OUT.

455
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,563
CYDNEY CAN'T HANG ON.

456
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,105
CYDNEY IS OUT.

457
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,565
AND WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

458
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:50,280
IT IS NOW AUBRY, AN ORIGINAL
BRAIN MEMBER, VERSUS JASON, AN

459
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:59,289
ORIGINAL BRAWN MEMBER.

460
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,582
>> I'M NOT BACKING DOWN.

461
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,543
>> NEITHER AM I, PAL.

462
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,587
>> Jeff: DOES THAT GET YOU A
LITTLE, AUBRY, WHEN JASON SAYS,

463
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,422
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE?

464
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,716
>> NOT AT ALL.

465
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,511
WHERE ELSE WOULD I EXPECT HIM TO
GO?

466
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,262
THIS GUY'S BEEN THROUGH
EVERYTHING.

467
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:24,648
WHY WOULD HE NOT GET THROUGH
THIS?

468
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:32,447
WHY WOULD HE NOT GET THROUGH
THIS?

469
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,782
>> Jeff:
SUPER IMPRESSED.

470
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,410
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DIGGING FOR A
LONG TIME.

471
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,456
AUBRY WITH A LITTLE SLIP.

472
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,459
AUBRY WITH A NICE RECOVERY.

473
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:50,632
BUT HER HANDS ARE NOW IN A TOUGH
SPOT.

474
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,675
CAN SHE GET IT BACK UP?

475
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,509
SHE DOES.

476
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,426
>> OH, MY GOD.

477
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,595
>> Jeff: ANOTHER NICE SAVE BY
AUBRY.

478
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,471
>> DAMN, AUBRY.

479
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,224
>> Jeff: THIS HAS BEEN A
BATTLE.

480
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,017
YOU'VE GOT TO DIG DEEP RIGHT
NOW.

481
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,687
THIS IS IT.

482
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,813
27 DAYS.

483
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,648
YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO HOME
TONIGHT BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T

484
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:12,320
KEEP YOUR ARMS UP JUST ONE MORE
SECOND.

485
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,321
AUBRY SLIPPING.

486
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,864
BOTH DISKS MOVING.

487
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:19,828
NOW IT'S JASON THAT'S MOVING.

488
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,704
KEEP FIGHTING!

489
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:26,835
YOU GOT TO DIG!

490
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:39,889
AND MORE SLIPPING.

491
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:40,765
>> YES!

492
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,810
>> Jeff: AUBRY DROPS.

493
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:47,480
JASON WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

494
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,526
WILL LIVE TO SEE DAY 28 IN A
HUGE CHALLENGE.

495
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,194
>> NICE JOB BOTH OF YOU.

496
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,655
>> GOOD JOB, JASON.

497
00:26:55,739 --> 00:27:00,160
>> NICE.

498
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:04,372
>> Jeff: JASON, COME ON OVER.

499
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,874
JASON, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

500
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,209
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

501
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,213
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER
27, AND I KNOW HOW TOUGH THESE

502
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,883
DAYS HAVE BEEN, SOMEBODY WILL BE
VOTED OUT TONIGHT AND BECOME THE

503
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,759
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

504
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,887
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.

505
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,096
CONGRATULATIONS.

506
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,890
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

507
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:26,561
>> THANKFULLY WE BEAT AUBRY, AND
WINNING IMMUNITY, IT LETS US

508
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:30,231
PLAY OUR IDOL AS A SUPER IDOL,
SO SCOT, TAI AND I, NO MATTER

509
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,900
WHAT HAPPENS, US THREE ARE SAFE.

510
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,986
AND FROM HERE ON OUT WE'RE
UNSTOPPABLE.

511
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:55,382
>> THAT WAS AMAZING.

512
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,466
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

513
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,759
>> YOU WERE SO STABLE.

514
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,593
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

515
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,095
>> IT WAS AMAZING.

516
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:00,929
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

517
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,013
I COULD NOT MOVE THAT.

518
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:02,847
>> IT'S OKAY.

519
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,808
WE GOT IT.

520
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,226
>> WE GOT IT.

521
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,771
>> THE WHOLE THING, ONE OF US
HAD TO.

522
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,898
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.

523
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,109
SHE WAS A HELL OF AN OPPONENT ON
THAT ONE.

524
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,945
>> YEAH.

525
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,614
>> SHE'S GONE.

526
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,990
>> IT WENT BETTER THAN I EVER
COULD HAVE DREAMED.

527
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:25,453
WE WENT THERE KNOWING WE
COULDN'T LET AUBRY WIN IMMUNITY.

528
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,124
FINALLY CYDNEY WENT DOWN AND IT
WAS BETWEEN AUBRY AND I, AND I

529
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:29,541
WON.

530
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,084
AND THAT'S HUGE.

531
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,838
>> YOU AND SCOT WILL NOT LEAVE
TONIGHT AND I AM NOT EITHER.

532
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,464
WE HAVE A SUPER IDOL.

533
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:36,756
WE'RE STAYING.

534
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,007
>> YEAH.

535
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,970
>> I HAVE THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE
AND WE HAVE TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY

536
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,764
IDOLS, WHICH COMBINE BECOME THE
SUPER IDOL.

537
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,808
WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THE SUPER
IDOL IS WE CAN PLAY IT AFTER THE

538
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,893
VOTE IS READ.

539
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,355
AND NO ONE BUT THE THREE OF US
KNOWS THAT.

540
00:28:52,439 --> 00:29:02,657
SO AUBRY'S GOING HOME, AND
THERE'S NOTHING SHE CAN DO.

541
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,326
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?

542
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:14,210
>> WELSH -- WELL, EVERYONE WANTS
TO GET RID OF TAI'S IDOL.

543
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,672
>> JEWELBACK OUR LITTLE DOUBLE
AGENT, IS COMING OVER AND

544
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,633
TELLING US THE GIRLS ARE VOTING
FOR TAI, AND THAT'S FINE.

545
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,178
WE'LL JUST PLAY THE SUPER ID.L.

546
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,973
AND SAVE HIM, BUT WHAT THEY
DON'T KNOW IS WE'RE GOING AFTER

547
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,183
AUBRY.

548
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,810
THAT'S A STRATEGIC MOVE, BECAUSE
SHE'S VERY SMART, SHE'S VERY

549
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,020
SAVVY, PLUS SHE'S TOUGH.

550
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,315
AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON FOR
HER TO GO, BECAUSE SHE IS SUCH A

551
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,692
THREAT IN THE CHALLENGES.

552
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:42,322
>> YOU'RE KIND OF PLAYING BOTH
SIDES, WHICH WE UNDERSTAND, BUT

553
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,700
YOU COME WITH US AND THEN WE
HAVE THE NUMBERS, WE KNOW WE

554
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:49,370
CAN'T BEAT TAI EITHER, SO WE
EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BLINDSIDE

555
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,163
HIM.

556
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,247
>> WHEN HE DOESN'T WIN AN
IMMUNITY.

557
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,376
>> AND THEN ONCE THAT HAPPEN,
WE'RE GOING FINAL THREE.

558
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,085
>> YEAH.

559
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,379
>> I'M STOKED RIGHT NOW.

560
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,258
THE GIRLS AND MYSELF ARE GOING
TO VOTE FOR TAI AND FLUSH HIS

561
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,468
IDOL.

562
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,887
AND SCOT AND JASON ARE AREN'T
REALLY TOO WORRIED ABOUT THAT

563
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,889
BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THEY WANT
TAI GONE ANYWAY.

564
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:12,685
THEY'D RATHER GO TO THE FINAL
THREE WITH ME, AND THAT WOULD BE

565
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,397
AWESOME BECAUSE THEY HAVE RUINED
RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALMOST EVERY

566
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,066
SINGLE PERSON OUT HERE, AND
THAT'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU

567
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:28,743
WANT TO STICK WITH AT THE END OF
THIS GAME.

568
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:34,123
>> WE NEED TO SPLIT UP SCOT AND
JASON, WHICH ARE THE POWER

569
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:34,624
PLAYERS RIGHT NOW.

570
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:38,419
>> I'M DOWN FOR IT.

571
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:43,424
>> I'M DEFINITELY THINKING SCOT.

572
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:48,054
>> WITH THE GIRL, THE GUYS ARE
JUST TOO DAMN POWERFUL.

573
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,265
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY THE GET
ONE OF THEM OUT.

574
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,768
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY THE BLIND
SIDE SCOT BECAUSE HE'S JUST SO

575
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:54,978
CONFIDENT IT'S RIDICULOUS.

576
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:59,315
HE'S DEFINITELY GOTTEN A LOT
COCKER SINCE HE FOUND THE IDOL

577
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,525
WITH JASON.

578
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,110
I'M LIKE, SIMMER DOWN, YOU WOULD
NOT HAVE THAT WITHOUT ME, SO

579
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:02,860
SHUT UP.

580
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:08,157
>> WE NEED TO FIND A CRACK
SOMEHOW.

581
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:14,330
>> HE AND I HAVE BEEN LIKE
PEOPLE ON CONNECTIONS IN

582
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,623
CRAIGSLIST ALL GAME.

583
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,794
>> AT THIS POINT THE GUYS ARE IN
A REALLY STRONG POSITION, BUT I

584
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:22,589
FEEL LIKE I HAVE SOME KIND OF
CONNECTION WITH TAI.

585
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:26,134
I THINK TAI IS SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF.

586
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:30,763
AND TAI'S NATURAL STATE IS NOT
WITH JASON AND SCOT.

587
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:35,810
AND I THINK HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO
KNOW THAT HE CAN'T BE THAT

588
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,478
INCONGRUENT AT THE END OF THE
DAY.

589
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,273
>> WHATEVER YOU SAY I'M DOWN
FOR.

590
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:47,280
>> OKAY.

591
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,158
>> THEY DON'T WANT ME TO TALK TO
YOU AT ALL BECAUSE THEY WANT US

592
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,703
TO VOTE FIVE AT YOU, BUT I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO.

593
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,997
I WANT TO TAKE OUT SCOT.

594
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,499
I KNOW CYDNEY IS FULLY ON BOARD.

595
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:05,465
I KNOW THAT JOE WOULD BE FULLY
ON BOARD.

596
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,215
I'M WORKING.

597
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,800
>> I'M VERY TORN ABOUT THIS
VOTE.

598
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,471
THE BIG THING IS WHERE IT'S
GOING TO PUT ME AT THE END.

599
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,890
>> CYDNEY THINKS WE SHOULD STICK
WITH OUR PEOPLE.

600
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:20,647
>> BUT SCOT AND JASON, I'M GOING
TO BREAK UP THAT DUO.

601
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,400
>> WHO DO YOU WANT IT TO BE?

602
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,693
WHAT'S BETTER FOR YOU?

603
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,530
>> MY HEART SAYS, YOU KNOW, I'D
LIKE TO WORK WITH AUBRY, AND MY

604
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,157
INSTINCT IS TO TRUST HER, BUT MY
BRAIN IS TELLING ME THE STAY

605
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,203
WITH THE BOYS BECAUSE THEY'VE
PISSED OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND

606
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,039
IF THE THREE OF US GO TO THE
FINAL THREE, MAYBE I HAVE A GOOD

607
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,082
CHANCE AT BEATING THEM.

608
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,543
>> I'M RELYING ON YOU PUTTING
YOURSELF OUT THERE.

609
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,504
I WANT YOU TO BE COMFORTABLE.

610
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,047
THIS IS YOUR GAME.

611
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,257
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MOVE.

612
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,594
AND I'M TELLING YOU, YOU HAVE
THREE PEOPLE BEHIND YOU.

613
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,679
I'M POSITIVE.

614
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,429
>> OKAY.

615
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,181
OKAY.

616
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,558
IF I FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, I
WILL LET YOU KNOW.

617
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,434
>> THIS IS A HUGE VOTE.

618
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:02,730
AND TAI HOLDS ALL OF THE KEYS IN
THIS GAME.

619
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:12,198
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE'S
GOING TO DO.

620
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,242
>> WE'RE VOTING FOR SCOT?

621
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,743
>> I'M GOOD.

622
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,452
I'M VOTING FOR SCOT.

623
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,079
>> WE KNOW WHO WE'RE VOTING FOR.

624
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,163
>> NO QUESTION.

625
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,165
AUBRY.

626
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,459
>> THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO
VOTE YOU.

627
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:28,965
WAIT UNTIL THE VOTE IS READ, AND
THEN WHOEVER IS VOTED OUT, BAM,

628
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:29,382
SUPER IDOL.

629
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,259
>> HERE WE GO.

630
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,888
>> HERE YOU GO, BUD.

631
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,308
>> IF ANYTHING HAPPENS YOU PLAY
IT, IF NOT WE GIVE IT BACK.

632
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,479
>> AT THIS POINT I TRULY DON'T
KNOW WHICH WAY I'M LEANING, BUT

633
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,356
I'M IN THE HERE THE MAKE GOOD
FRIENDS.

634
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,567
I'M HERE TO WIN THAT $1 MILLION.

635
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,154
SO I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME, AND I HAVE

636
00:33:51,237 --> 00:34:01,247
TO COMMIT TO IT, BECAUSE AFTER
THAT THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

637
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:09,380
TO COMMIT TO IT, BECAUSE AFTER
THAT THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

638
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:14,969
>> Sarah: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

639
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,763
NEAL, NICK.

640
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:23,144
AND DEBBIE VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

641
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,354
MICHELE, A LOT WENT DOWN LAST
TRIBAL.

642
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,192
IT WAS A PRETTY BIG DISPLAY OF
IDOL POWER FROM JASON, TAI AND

643
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,401
SCOT.

644
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,322
>> YEAH, THEY MADE A BIG SHOW OF
IT, AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHOSE

645
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:41,370
HAND THOSE IDOLS ARE GOING THE
LIE INCH IT'S NERVE-RACKING.

646
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,247
>> Jeff: SCOT, YOU'RE A FORMER
ATHLETE.

647
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,500
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
MAKE A STATEMENT IN THE PRESS,

648
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,336
YOU ARE ENCOURAGING YOUR
TEAMMATES, BUT YOU'RE ALSO

649
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,129
SAYING TO THE OPPONENT, BRING
IT.

650
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,215
>> IT WAS ALMOST A LITTLE BIT OF
TRASH TALKING.

651
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,676
AND WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DOING THE
SAME THING TONIGHT.

652
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,011
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

653
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:59,180
>> Jeff: JASON, YOU'RE
NODDING.

654
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,139
JUST LOVING THIS.

655
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,098
>> I LOVE IT.

656
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,851
YOU KNOW, WE PUT UP SOME
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE.

657
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,103
IT WORKED.

658
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,688
IT BROKE DEBBIE UNFORTUNATELY,
AND NEW THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

659
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,691
WHICH ONE OF THEIR TONE CUT
AGAIN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T CUT US.

660
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,070
IT'S EITHER THEY DECIDE OR WE
DECIDE.

661
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,698
>> Jeff: AUBRY, IT'S GOT TO BE
A LITTLE FRUSTRATING TO HEAR,

662
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,325
THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU HIGH
APPRECIATE IT AS FAN.

663
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:24,831
>> I MEAN, WITH THESE THREE IT'S
LIKE YOU KEEP RUNNING INTO A

664
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,042
WALL, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THE HECK IS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND

665
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:28,960
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW.

666
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,545
>> WE TRIED TO TELL YOU WHAT WAS
HAPPENING.

667
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,504
WE DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE.

668
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,381
WE ASKED YOU FOR A DEAL, AND
YOU...

669
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,218
>> EVERYONE HERE SHOULD KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING,

670
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,386
BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER HID
ANYTHING.

671
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,056
>> NO, WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING, AND WE DO IT.

672
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:46,352
>> Jeff: JILLIAN, A LITTLE
UNNERVING WHEN THE THREE OF THEM

673
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,395
SAY, I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S ONE
OF THE FIVE OF YOU.

674
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,604
>> OF COURSE.

675
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:53,609
THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS TRULY
SAFE HERE IS JASON, BUT THE FACT

676
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,403
THAT ALL THESE IDOLS WERE
BROUGHT TO EVERYONE'S ATTENTION

677
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,239
HAS MADE EVERYONE REALLY, REALLY
WANT THE PLAY.

678
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,449
>> Jeff: CYDNEY, A LITTLE
NERVOUS COULD BE YOU?

679
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,702
>> TONIGHT I'M DEFINITELY
NERVOUS.

680
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:06,414
JASON AND SCOT ARE A LITTLE
SALTY THAT I LEFT THEM AND WENT

681
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,331
TO ANOTHER SHIP.

682
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,250
>> Jeff: SO CYDNEY, WHAT DO
YOU DO TODAY?

683
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,918
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE YOU.

684
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:11,794
YOU'RE 27 DAYS.

685
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,086
YOU'RE CLOSE.

686
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,254
>> YEAH.

687
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,257
SINCE WE ARE THIS CLOSE,
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO TAKE INTO

688
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,928
ACCOUNT, WHO IS THEIR WEST --
BEST BET TO GO IN CHALLENGES.

689
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,179
I HAVEN'T MADE ANY CHALLENGES.

690
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:26,100
>> SHE MAKES A VALID POINT, BUT
SHE'S ALSO FORGOT, THE PEOPLE

691
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:28,269
THAT HAVE BEEN WOMEN IN THE
CHALLENGES AREN'T GOING HOME

692
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,186
TONIGHT.

693
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,063
>> Jeff: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
YOU AND TAI.

694
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,608
>> BING YORK AND NEITHER IS
SCOT.

695
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,736
>> Jeff: TAI, WHAT'S GOING ON
IN YOUR MIND, BECAUSE YOU SEEM

696
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,946
LESS TALKATIVE TONIGHT.

697
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,365
ARE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE
BOASTING?

698
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:47,914
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO IN MY
PERSONAL LIFE, BUT THIS IS WAR.

699
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,457
AND I'M COMMITTED TO THESE GUYS.

700
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,170
AND I GOT TO DO EVERYTHING TO
ADVANCE MY GAME.

701
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,339
>> HE HAS STEPPED UP FOR OUR
ALLIANCE TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

702
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,967
>> Jeff: AUBRY, TALK ABOUT THE
CHALLENGE TODAY.

703
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,305
YOU PUT UP A MASSIVE EFFORT
AGAINST JASON.

704
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,600
WAS THAT A WAY OF SAYING, I'M
NOT JUST A BRAIN?

705
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,144
>> I THINK IT WAS, JEFF.

706
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,981
LIKE WHEN AGAIN IN MY LIFE AM I
GOING TO HAVE AN NBA PLAYER ON

707
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:19,111
ONE SIDE, A KICK-AS VETERAN ON
THE OTHER WHO IS STARING ME DOWN

708
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,281
AND SPITTING AND I'M SPITTING
BACK AT HIM LIKE A DERANGED

709
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:22,990
LLAMA.

710
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,368
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN
AGAIN.

711
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,663
WE WERE PUT ENTER A GROUP,
BRAINS, BRAWN AND BEAUTY, BUT I

712
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,499
THINK THAT ONLY SCRATCHES THE
SURFACE OF WHO ALL OF THESE

713
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,667
PEOPLE ARE.

714
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,503
AND IT WAS JUST A MOMENT TODAY
TO BE STANDING UP THERE WITH A

715
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:40,841
BRAWN AND THEN THERE WAS JUST
THAT... IT'S OVER.

716
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,969
>> BUT TODAY WASN'T NEW.

717
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,471
SHE'S BEEN GIVING GREAT EFFORT
IN EVERY FACET OF THE GAME THUS

718
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,639
FAR.

719
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,976
>> SHE'S BEEN KICKING BUTT THE
ENTIRE TIME SHE'S BEEN HERE.

720
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,479
THIS THERE'S AS MUCH BRAWN IN
HER AS THERE IS IN ME.

721
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,564
>> Jeff: MICHELE, IT'S AMAZING
HOW MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE

722
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,483
A METAPHOR FOR THE GAME.

723
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,027
YOU HAD IT AND THEN IT'S OVER.

724
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,320
>> YEAH.

725
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,323
EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME CAN
HAPPEN IN A MOMENT, AND YOU

726
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,701
NEVER KNOW WHEN THAT MOMENT IS,
BUT YOU BETTER BE ON THE RIGHT

727
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,536
SIDE OF THE MOMENT WHEN IT
HAPPENS.

728
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:13,040
>> THEM SAYING SINCE WE WALKED
IN HERE, IF YOU CAUGHT WIND OF

729
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,043
WHAT'S GOING ON, IT'S SMARTER TO
BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS.

730
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,587
SO MIGHT AS WELL JUMP ON BOARD
THE TRAIN, OTHERWISE THE WORLD'S

731
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:23,426
GOING TO BE DICTATED FOR YOU.

732
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,927
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

733
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,846
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

734
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:37,898
MICHELE, YOU'RE UP.

735
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:49,410
>> THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE YOU ARE
SUCH A GREAT COMPETITOR.

736
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:56,792
>> THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE YOU ARE
SUCH A GREAT COMPETITOR.

737
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:06,969
>> PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

738
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:18,564
>> PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

739
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:30,159
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

740
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,412
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

741
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:42,463
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

742
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:50,387
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

743
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,182
>> OKAY.

744
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,683
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL, PERSON VOTED

745
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,479
OUT WILL BE ASKED THE LEAVE THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

746
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,523
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

747
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:05,986
FIRST VOTE, TAI.

748
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,531
AUBRY.

749
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:12,993
SCOT.

750
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:13,661
TAI.

00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,587
ONE VOTE SCOT.

755
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,672
SCOT.

756
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,384
TWO VOTES SCOT.

757
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,552
SCOT.

758
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:33,472
THAT'S THREE VOALTS SCOT, TWO
VOTES TAI, TWO VOTES AUBRY.

759
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:40,813
ONE VOTE LEFT.

760
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:50,865
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, SCOT.

761
00:40:50,948 --> 00:41:10,551
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, SCOT.

762
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:10,801
>> NO?

763
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,597
WOW.

764
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,576
SCOTT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

765
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:45,628
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

766
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,631
WELL, ONCE AGAIN, JUST WHEN YOU
THINK YOU'RE SAFE, OOP, THERE

767
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,258
GOES ANOTHER BLIND SIDE.

768
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,594
12 DAYS LEFT, SHOULD MAKE FOR A
VERY INTERESTING FINISH.

769
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,096
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

770
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,472
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

771
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,725
GOOD NIGHT.

STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR
NEXT EPISODE.

775
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,242
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," AFTER BETRAYING

776
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,245
JASON, TAI'S ON TOP OF THE
WORLD.

777
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,120
>> I HAVE POWER NOW.

778
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:25,626
>> BUT JASON AND JULIA ARE OUT
FOR BLOOD.

779
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,795
>> THIS GAME IS DESIGNED TO BE
VICIOUS.

780
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,338
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT NUMBERS.

781
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,214
>> TAI MADE ME ANGRY.

782
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,758
>> REALLY I JUST WANT REVENGE
RIGHT NOW.

783
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:36,762
>> JASON WON IMMUNITY AND HE
SAID, HERE, TAKE THIS.

784
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:37,972
I TRUST YOU.

785
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,808
OBVIOUSLY WE COULDN'T TRUST TAI
SO THE PLAN DIDN'T WORK, SO

786
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:45,479
THAT'S A BAD FEELING FOR ME
BECAUSE I'VE GOT AN IDOL IN MY

787
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:48,357
POCKET THAT BELONGS TO JASON AND
IT SHOULD BE WITH HIM, BUT IT'S

788
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,567
A GOOD PLAY BY TAI.

789
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,944
AND I GOT BLINDSIDED.

790
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:57,157
AND I'M OUT.
