1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:05,255
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON "SURVIVOR".

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,757
18 AMERICANS WERE

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,092
ABANDONED ON A REMOTE POLYNESIAN

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:09,759
ISLAND.

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:10,301
ALL WITH ONE GOAL IN MIND.

6
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,095
I JUST WANT TO BE THE

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,807
GREATEST SURVIVOR OF ALL TIME.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,225
Jeff: THEY WERE QUICKLY

9
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,768
DIVIDED INTO TWO TRIBES-- THE

10
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,019
MEN VERSUS THE WOMEN.

11
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,772
MEN, YOUR TRIBE NAME IS MANONO.

12
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,274
WOMEN, YOUR TRIBE NAME IS

13
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:24,941
SALANI.

14
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:25,817
Jeff: BUT NOT EVERYONE WAS

15
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,484
THRILLED.

16
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,237
I'M THE GIRL WITHIN THE GUY

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,821
TRIBE.

18
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,572
Jeff: AND FOR THE FIRST

19
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,322
TIME IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY, TWO

20
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,992
TRIBES FOUND THEMSELVES

21
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,577
COEXISTING ON ONE BEACH IN A

22
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,786
BATTLE OF THE SEXES.

23
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,456
SEEMS LIKE TOTAL CHAOS.

24
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,082
Jeff: ON THE SALANI TRIBE,

25
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,083
A GROUP OF YOUNG WOMEN WERE

26
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,001
RUNNING THE SHOW.

27
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:47,130
IT'S KIM, CHELSEA, KITTY KAT,

28
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,631
MYSELF AND A BRIE THAT AND IT

29
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,135
WAS DONE IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.

30
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,804
Jeff: AND AT MANONO, THE

31
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,597
MUSCLE TOOK CONTROL.

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,182
BIG MIKE, JAY-BIRD AND BILL.

33
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,602
I'M SITTING PRETTY AS FAR AS I'M

34
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,186
CONCERNED.

35
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,896
Jeff: A BRIE THAT THOUGHT

36
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,189
SHE HAD IT MADE WHEN SHE FOUND A

37
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,815
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

38
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,985
I FOUND THE IDOL!

39
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,987
Jeff: BUT ALL SHE HAD WAS A

40
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,654
TU DECISION TO MAKE.

41
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,826
IT'S FOR THE MANONO TRIBE, I

42
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,368
HAVE TO GIVE IT UP BEFORE THE

43
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,370
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

44
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,664
Jeff: SABRINA GAVE IT TO

45
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,002
THE MAN ON THE OUTS, COLTON.

46
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,462
A RACE WAS CUT SHORT WHEN

47
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,797
KOURTNEY COULDN'T CONTINUE.

48
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,506
WITH KOURTNEY'S STATUS IN THE

49
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,381
GAME UNCERTAIN, THE WOMEN HEADED

50
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,425
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

51
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,637
AND AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, THE WOMEN

52
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,054
IMPLODED.

53
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:36,888
YOU'RE WRONG!

54
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:37,514
OKAY?

55
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,682
SO SHUT UP!

56
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,892
Jeff: AND WHEN IT LOOKED

57
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,477
LIKE IT COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE,

58
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,353
IT DID.

59
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,354
LET ME GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON

60
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:44,938
KOURTNEY.

61
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,315
SHE IS OUT OF THE GAME.

62
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,399
BUT DESPITE THE BAD NEWS, THERE

63
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,400
WAS A GLIMMER OF HOPE.

64
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,694
THE GOOD NEWS: NOBODY SELLS

65
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,862
GOING HOME TONIGHT.

66
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,530
THERE ARE 36 DAYS LEFT IN THIS

67
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,865
GAME AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT

68
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,825
TOGETHER, NONE OF YOU WILL MAKE

69
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,828
IT TO THE END.

70
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,537
17 ARE LEFT.

71
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:14,217
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

72
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,426
GOOD EVENING, LADIES.

73
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:25,728
HI.

74
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,479
THE GUY SAID THAT THEY WERE

75
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,565
TAKING CARE OF OUR FIRE WHEN WE

76
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,440
WERE GONE BUT MIND YOU I AM THE

77
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,986
FIRE PERSON AND IF THEY WEREN'T

78
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,113
THERE WHEN I GOT BACK I PROBABLY

79
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,739
WOULD HAVE... I WOULDN'T HAVE

80
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,617
BEEN ABLE TO GET IT... WHOA.

81
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,577
WHOA!

82
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,286
SORRY.

83
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,912
I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT

84
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,163
MYSELF.

85
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,248
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO VOTE

86
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,207
ANYBODY OUT?

87
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,250
NO, SHE BROKE HER WRIST IN SO

88
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,252
MANY DIFFERENT PLACES SHE HAS TO

89
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:49,752
HAVE SURGERY.

90
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,212
REALLY?

91
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:51,921
TONIGHT A COUPLE OF THE GUYS

92
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,090
WENT OVER TO THE WOMEN'S CAMP TO

93
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,925
SEE WHAT WENT ON WITH TRIBAL

94
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,593
COUNCIL.

95
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,135
KOURTNEY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO

96
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:57,844
WENT HOME.

97
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:58,970
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO VOTE ANYBODY

98
00:02:59,053 --> 00:02:59,679
OFF.

99
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,222
THEY'RE ALL SAFE AND IT'S ALL

100
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:01,681
ANNOYING.

101
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,765
I'M GOING TO BED.

102
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,728
SEE YOU GUYS IN THE MORNING.

103
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,604
ALICIA?

104
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,271
YEAH.

105
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,314
IS IT OKAY THAT YOU AND I CAN

106
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,064
TALK?

107
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,900
WE CAN TALK PRIVATE IF YOU WANT

108
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,276
OR WE CAN TALK WHEREVER YOU FEEL

109
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:13,735
COMFORTABLE.

110
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,277
I DON'T CARE.

111
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,945
IT'S UP TO YOU.

112
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,487
I THINK YOU AND I SHOULD

113
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,906
CLEAR SOME STUFF.

114
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,573
SURE.

115
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,160
TRIBAL COUNCIL COULDN'T HAVE

116
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,370
GONE ANY BETTER THAN I PLANNED.

117
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,998
THANK YOU, CHRISTINA, FOR MAKING

118
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,999
YOURSELF LOOK CRAZY AND TELLING

119
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:32,545
ME TO SHUT UP AND FOR ALSO

120
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,421
LYING.

121
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,756
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE ALL RIGHT

122
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,590
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME TO

123
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,299
SHUT UP.

124
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,800
I WOULD NEVER TALK TO YOU THAT

125
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,468
WAY, EVER.

126
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,510
YOU JUST KEPT GOING ON AND ON

127
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,971
AND ON AND WEREN'T GIVING ME A

128
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,181
CHANCE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF.

129
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,766
I FELT LIKE TO ME THAT WAS RUDE.

130
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,308
OKAY.

131
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,434
IT WAS DISRESPECTFUL.

132
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,310
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL THAN

133
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,354
I'M SORRY THAT I MADE YOU FEEL

134
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,939
THAT WAY BECAUSE THAT
WAS NOT MY INTENTION.

135
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:51,606
YOU'RE RIGHT.

136
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,275
I MEAN, PLEASE, IF I SAW HER

137
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,944
SWIMMING IN AN OCEAN AND SHE WAS

138
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:56,819
DROWNING I PROBABLY WOULD LOOK

139
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,695
THE OTHER WAY.

140
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,197
(LAUGHS)

141
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,074
OKAY, LIKE, SERIOUSLY, DON'T

142
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,158
EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

143
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:02,825
ALL RIGHT, ARE WE GOOD?

144
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,161
WE'RE GOOD, GIRL, DON'T EVEN

145
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:05,828
WORRY ABOUT IT.

146
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,164
I HAVE MY FIVE.

147
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,291
KIM, KAT, CHELSEA, SABRINA AND

148
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,168
MYSELF SO IF IT WERE UP TO ME

149
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,378
AND EVERYBODY, WE WANT HER OUT.

150
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,545
BUT WE NEED TO WIN CHALLENGES

151
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,799
AND NINA LOOKS LIKE A BAG OF

152
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,508
ROCKS AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

153
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,343
THAT ANALOGY MEANS BUT SHE IS

154
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,178
NOT MOVING.

155
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,305
(LAUGHS)

156
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,658
IS EVERYONE HERE?

157
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,077
ALL RIGHT.

158
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,161
OKAY, LADIES.

159
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,038
OBVIOUSLY WE JUST CAME OFF

160
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,373
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND IT WAS A

161
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,332
LITTLE FIERY BUT WE MADE IT

162
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,041
THROUGH.

163
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,835
IT'S A WASH SO LET'S GET OVER

164
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,502
THAT.

165
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,920
LET'S SET GROUND RULES AND I

166
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,505
THINK IT CAN GO A LOT SMOOTHER.

167
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,548
EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO BE

168
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,048
HEARD.

169
00:04:59,132 --> 00:04:59,841
CAN I ADD SOMETHING?

170
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,217
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

171
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,510
WHEN YOU TALK, GET TO THE POINT,

172
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,219
BE DIRECT.

173
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:03,928
THE QUICKER WE CAN GET THROUGH

174
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,555
THIS MEETING THE QUICKER WE CAN

175
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,181
GET TO BUSINESS AND GET THINGS

176
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,433
DONE HOW THIS CAMP SHOULD BE

177
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,142
GOING, STOCK?

178
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:09,851
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD, LIKE,

179
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,894
HAVE A LEADER AND SAY ALL RIGHT,

180
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,062
LET'S LEAVE IT UP TO HER?

181
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,356
I SAY SABRINA?

182
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,232
SAB?

183
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,859
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DIRECT,

184
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,444
STRAIGHT TO THE POINT, YOU DON'T

185
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,069
B.S.

186
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,237
YOU SPEAK TO US LIKE GROWN

187
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,821
WOMEN.

188
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:22,530
WE DON'T GET OFFENDED.

189
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,073
AND YOU DON'T BARK ORDERS.

190
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,741
FINE.

191
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,369
I'LL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY.

192
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,078
MANAGING THE AIR HEADS IS GOING

193
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,413
TO BE EXHAUSTING.

194
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,290
BUT HOPEFULLY WITH THIS NEW

195
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,125
LEADERSHIP ROLE I CAN COME IN

196
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,169
THERE AND JUST BE LIKE SHH.

197
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,712
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE THREE

198
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,380
CATEGORIES, WATER, FOOD, AND

199
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,089
SHELTER.

200
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:40,506
DOES ANYONE WANT TO BE STRAIGHT

201
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,716
UP ON WATER?

202
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,383
LIKE...

203
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,593
I'M WATER ALL THE TIME AND I

204
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,428
GOT ALL THE CANTEENS AND I'D

205
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,429
LIKE TO GET THEM ALL FILLED UP

206
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,764
TO THE GRIM IN AN HOUR.

207
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,474
OKAY.

208
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:49,932
GOOD.

209
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,100
MONICA ON WATER.

210
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,769
KAT AND I WILL GO SEARCHING

211
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,770
FOR FOOD.

212
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,147
IF YOU GO, SURVEY THE LAND

213
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,856
FIRST.

214
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,774
MAKE MARKERS, KNOW EXACTLY WHERE

215
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,441
YOU WENT.

216
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,567
I DON'T WANT TO OBSERVE THE

217
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,151
LAND.

218
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,736
I WANT TO GO GET STUFF.

219
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,112
NO, OBSERVE AND GET WHAT YOU

220
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,447
CAN ON THE WAY BACK.

221
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,616
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING

222
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,283
TO DO.

223
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,785
AT THIS POINT IT'S DEFINITELY

224
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,454
THE FIVE YOUNGER GALS KIM,

225
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,165
CHELSEA, KAT, SAB AND ALICIA

226
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,583
AGAINST CHRISTINA, MONICA AND I.

227
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,294
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND MY

228
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:18,961
PLACE.

229
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,963
I'LL NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED

230
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,298
TURNING ON THE FAUCET AND

231
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,467
GETTING SOME WATER!

232
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,134
NO LUCK ON BANANAS?

233
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,470
I'M STILL GOING TO SEARCH IF

234
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,679
MY PARTNER WOULD LIKE TO GO IN

235
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,597
THE JUNGLE WITH ME.

236
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,973
SHE WAS ALL ABOUT GOING TO THE

237
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,641
JUNGLE.

238
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,017
NOW I'M GOING TO GO IN THE

239
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,352
JUNGLE AND FIND THE BANANAS SO

240
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,478
WHEN I DO FIND THE BANANAS

241
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,729
EVERYBODY WILL BE LIKE "OH, MY

242
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,647
GOD, I FOUND BANANAS."

243
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,149
THERE'S A DEFINITE IMMATURITY

244
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,192
FACTOR ON THE PART OF SOME OF

245
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:41,901
THESE WOMEN.

246
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,611
I LIKE KAT, I THINK SHE'S FUN.

247
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,279
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

248
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:45,696
I'M 51 YEARS OLD AND SHE'S

249
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,615
DRIVING ME NUTS!

250
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,783
SHE'S DRIVING ME NUTS.

251
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,660
I JUST WANT HER TO SHUT UP AND

252
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,327
WORK!

253
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,204
I DON'T WANT TO TIE ANY KNOTS

254
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,372
IF WE HAVE A CHALLENGE.

255
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,290
MY FINGERS HURT SO BAD.

256
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,458
>>S WHERE EVERYBODY?

257
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,334
ARE WE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE

258
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,627
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING

259
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,044
ANYTHING?

260
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:00,753
I DON'T KNOW.

261
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,337
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

262
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,009
I DON'T KNOW, EITHER.

263
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,344
TREEMAIL!

264
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,348
TREEMAIL!

265
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,184
HEY, IT SAYS "DO NOT OPEN THIS

268
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,356
BRING THE LETTER AND THE BOXES

271
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,193
WE WENT TO TREEMAIL AND THERE

272
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,444
WAS AN ENORMOUS BOX.

273
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,656
I WAS HOPING IT WAS FOOD.

274
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,199
ALL RIGHT, ONE... HOLD.

275
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,035
HOLD ON.

276
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,040
IT'S THIS HUGE BOX.

277
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,542
DOESN'T TARZAN LOOK NAKED

278
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,085

279
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:41,502

280
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,214
YEAH TARZAN!

281
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,216
FLEX THOSE MUSCLES!

282
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,554
TREEMAIL, Y'ALL.

283
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,056
READ IT.

288
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,525
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

289
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,235
IF SOMETHING JUMPS OUT OF

290
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,904
THERE, I'M LIKE...

291
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,615
"MANONO AND SALANI YOU HAVE

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

299
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,251
YOU EACH HAVE A BOX CONTAINING A

300
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,794
SERIES OF KNOTTED ROPES ATTACHED

301
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,712

THEIR KNOTS COMPLETELY

304

SEPARATING THE RING WINS THE

REWARD.

306
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,138

"YOU WILL BE GETTING RAIN AND

312
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,396
THIS WILL SURELY KEEP YOU DRY."

313
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,606
THAT WILL HELP!

314
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,608
LOOK AT OUR ROOF.

320
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,954
OKAY, GUYS, OKAY.

321
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,121
BECAUSE WE HAVE ONE EXTRA

HE CAN NOT PARTICIPATE

325

WHATSOEVER IN THIS CHALLENGE.

326
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,172
THE TIMING COULDN'T HAVE BEEN

327
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:08,839
BETTER.

328
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,257
WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT TARP.

329
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,341
WE NEED IT.

330
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,509
THE PRESSURE'S ON.

331
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,009
HERE'S WHERE WE CAN SHINE.

332
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,637
LET'S GET IT DONE.

333
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,139
SURVIVORS READY?

00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,476
JAZZ FINGERS!

GO!

337
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,692
OVER THERE, OVER THERE.

338
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,859
PULL IT OUT THIS WAY.

339
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,944
PULL IT OUT TO THE FRONT.

340
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,029
PULL IT OUT!

341
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:32,488
EVERYBODY.

342
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,323
ONE, TWO, THREE!

343
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,032
WHEN THE CHARGE STARTS, WE

344
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,867
WANTED TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF

345
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,952
THE BOX ON THE GROUND.

346
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,120
AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENS,

347
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,163
EVERYBODY JUST STARTED ON THE

348
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,206
OUTSIDE, WORKED THEIR WAY IN.

349
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,833
WE HAD TO JUST UNTIE

350
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,959
CONTINUOUSLY AND YOU FINALLY GET

351
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,835
TO THE MIDDLE AND THERE'S A RING

352
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,045
AND YOU HAVE TO UNTIE THE RING.

353
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,172
YOU CAN BRACE IT BETWEEN YOUR

354
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:50,715
KNEES.

355
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,549
WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT.

356
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,467
I GOT MINE OUT!

357
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,051
MINE ARE OUT!

358
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,511
MINE ARE OUT!

359
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,555
OKAY, MINE'S DONE HERE.

360
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,181
WE NEED THIS FREAKING TARP.

361
00:09:59,265 --> 00:09:59,849
GO!

362
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,558
GO!

363
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,767
EVERYBODY WAS IN A LITTLE BIT

364
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,979
OF A FRENZY BECAUSE WE HAD TO

365
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:05,896
GOVERN OURSELVES.

366
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,481
IT'S GOING TO BE RAINING HERE

367
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,858
VERY SOON SO THAT TARP IS THE

368
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,735
BIGGEST BENEFIT I THINK ANYONE

369
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,486
CAN HAVE.

370
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,906
OLD THAT ONE, HOLD THAT ONE.

371
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,241
THERE, THAT ONE'S OFF.

372
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:17,867
THAT ONE'S OFF.

373
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,701
RIGHT HERE!

374
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,870
PULL THAT, PULL THAT PART.

375
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,537
GO, GO!

376
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,873
I WAS SO INTO THE CHALLENGE.

377
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,166
THAT WAS OUR MOMENTUM AND THAT

378
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,502
WAS OUR SPEED AS A GROUP TO PULL

379
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,587
ALL THE ROPES OUT.

380
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,713
WE HAVE TO WIN THIS.

381
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,380
HOLD UP.

382
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:31,839
HOLD UP.

383
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,382
GUYS, SLOW DOWN.

384
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,550
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A BIGGER

385
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,593
KNOT IN ALL THIS, RIGHT?

386
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,218
I KNOW.

387
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,346
MAKE THIS COUNT.

388
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,722
GET THIS RIGHT HERE.

389
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,097
I'LL GET IT.

390
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,892
GO, GO, GO!

391
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,935
QUICK, QUICK!

392
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,355
COME ON, GET THIS BLUE ONE!

393
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,272
RIGHT HERE.

394
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,901
RIGHT HERE!

395
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,819
GO, GO.

396
00:10:53,903 --> 00:11:01,535
(MEN CHEERING)

397
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,411
GOOD JOB.

398
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:07,917
GOOD JOB, MAN.

399
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,877
WE LOST THE DAMN CHALLENGE

400
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,088
AND THAT HURT MY SOUL!

401
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,882
WE NEEDED A TARP LIKE A FAT KID

402
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,299
NEEDS CAKE.

403
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:15,800
WE NEEDED IT.

404
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,052
WE WANTED IT.

405
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,095
WE WERE SECONDS AWAY FROM

406
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,763
WINNING SO IT WASN'T A HORRIBLE

407
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,431
LOSS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

408
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,099
IT'S A LOSS.

409
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,101
NO ONE EVER REMEMBERS SECOND

410
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,227
PLACE.

411
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,828
TARZAN, BRO.

412
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,787
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA BE THERE

413
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,123
ALL DAY DOING THAT, DUDE.

414
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,040
THAT TARP IS CRITICAL.

415
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,126
LET'S SEE HOW BIG IT IS.

416
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:50,793
LET'S OPEN IT UP.

417
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,253
THIS IS A LONG BABY.

418
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:52,837
WOW!

419
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,131
LOOK AT THAT, MAN!

420
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,132
TODAY WE WON.

421
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,466
IT WAS LIKE IT WAS GAME ON AND

422
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,801
WE ALL FINISHED THE CHALLENGE.

423
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,594
WE WERE THE ONE THAT CAME OUT ON

424
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,303
TOP.

425
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:01,887
WE GOT THAT TARP WHICH WAS LIKE

426
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:02,972
THE ICING ON THE CAKE.

427
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,974
OUR CAMP IS GOING TO LOOK GREAT.

428
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,934
THE MANONO TRIBE, WE'LL HAVE THE

429
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,810
BEST CAMP PROBABLY IN HISTORY.

430
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,019
LET'S ROCK AND ROLL.

431
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:23,993
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

432
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,161
PRETTY PROUD OF THIS CAMP.

433
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,665
DUDE, THIS IS PERFECT.

434
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:36,672
WHO BUILT THIS?

435
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,174
COLTON TODAY HAS DONE

436
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:38,841
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

437
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,176
HE'S PROVED HE'S THE WORST

438
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,886
PERSON FOR OUR TRIBE.

439
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,679
NO FIREWOOD, NO FOOD, NOTHING

440
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,305
WITH THE SHELTER.

441
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,515
HE FEELS LIKE THIS IS A

442
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,224
VACATION.

443
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,851
COLTON IS JUST HERE TO HANG OUT.

444
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,186
IN THE GIRL'S CAMP.

445
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,480
WHAT IS HE THINKING?

446
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,023
HE'S THE ONLY ONE NOT DOING

447
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:54,690
ANYTHING.

448
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,193
HE CALLS HIMSELF THE QUEEN.

449
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,694
YEAH, YEAH.

450
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,029
HE'S GOT ALL THE GIRLS IN HIS

451
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,740
HAND LIKE PUTTY, BRO, IF WE'RE

452
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,991
DOWN NUMBERS WE'RE DONE, BRO.

453
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,036
HE'S WORKING IT, BRO.

454
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,747
HE'S MAKING RUSSELL LOOK LIKE A

455
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:18,380
FREAKING LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL.

456
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,884
SO WE'RE JUST GOING LAYER BY

457
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,552
LAYER DOING TWO AT A TIME.

458
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,054
I'M SERIOUSLY ABOUT TO WALK

459
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,681
OFF THIS ISLAND.

460
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,891
YOU'RE NOT WALKING OFF THIS

461
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,558
ISLAND.

462
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,018
YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH SPUNK TO

463
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,895
WALK OFF THE ISLAND.

464
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,438
YOU SHOULD TRY BONDING WITH THE

465
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,105
GUYS.

466
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:35,773
TRY A DIFFERENT METHOD, YOU

467
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,482
NEVER KNOW.

468
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,233
I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH

469
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,067
THE GUYS.

470
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,069
WE ALL HAVE AN EXTRA APPENDAGE,

471
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,653
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I HAVE IN

472
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,946
COMMON WITH THESE PEOPLE.

473
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,073
BUT GOING OVER TO THE GIRLS IS

474
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,074
KIND OF LIKE IT'S A RELEASE FOR

475
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,243
ME BECAUSE IT'S LIKE GOD, AT

476
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,452
LEAST I HAVE PEOPLE I CAN RELATE

477
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,246
TO AND TALK TO AND, YOU KNOW,

478
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,288
FIND COMMON GROUND WITH.

479
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,082
I LOVE THE GIRLS MORE THAN

480
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,084
ANYBODY ON THIS ISLAND.

481
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,753
ALL RIGHT, HE NEEDS A TIME

482
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,629
LIMIT OVER HERE.

483
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,422
COLTON, I'M GOING TO NEED YOU

484
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,298
TO MOVE OUT OF MY WAY.

485
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,300
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT

486
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:03,842
THAT?

487
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:04,635
DID I DO THIS WRONG?

488
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,762
NO, WE'RE JUST... I'M

489
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,556
STACKING A SECOND LAYER.

490
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,807
SO... JUST LEAVE IT.

491
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,100
WE'RE GOOD.

492
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:11,976
ARE YOU SURE?

493
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,063
YEAH.

494
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,983
COLTON IS LIKE A VIRUS.

495
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,569
LIKE THERE SEEMS TO BE NOT A

496
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,779
CURE FOR HIM JUST YET.

497
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,322
TODAY I FOUND MYSELF WITHOUT

498
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:25,990
EVEN THINKING JUST ENTERTAINING

499
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,909
HIM HALF THE MORNING.

500
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,620
AND I'M JUST LIKE WHAT AM I

501
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,246
DOING?

502
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,997
COLTON, WHY YOU OVER HERE?

503
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,915
I'M OVER HERE BECAUSE I DON'T

504
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,000
WANT TO BE OVER THERE.

505
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:36,792
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T WANT TO TALK

506
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,668
GAME AT ALL.

507
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,335
I JUST WANT TO...

508
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,628
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A

509
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,838
GIRL TALK.

510
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,505
SORRY.

511
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,339
ARE YOU GUYS READY TO START?

512
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:42,965
YES.

513
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,800
OKAY, SORRY.

514
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,176
THAT'S COOL.

515
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,346
CAN I COME HANG OUT WITH Y'ALL

516
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,888
LATER?

517
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,806
I'LL ASK THE GIRLS.

518
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,473
IT'S COOL.

519
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,641
IT'S A JOINT DECISION AROUND

520
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,309
HERE.

521
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,852
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, IT'S

522
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,144
COOL.

523
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,020
OKAY.

524
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,648
LET'S HAVE A MEETING NOW.

525
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,692
I RELATE MORE TO GIRLS.

526
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,027
AND I GO OVER THERE AND TRY TO

527
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,612
HELP THEM AND THEY'RE LIKE "YOU

528
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,863
NEED TO GO."

529
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,072
AND THEY WANT TO HAVE A GIRL

530
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,824
MEETING SO I LITERALLY FEEL LIKE

531
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,034
I NEED TO FIND SOMEWHERE ON THE

532
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,828
ISLAND AND BUILD MY OWN LITTLE

533
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,415
HUT AND LIVE THERE AND BY MY OWN

534
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:16,999
LITTLE TRIBE.

535
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,168
BASICALLY IT'S NOT A REAL

536
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,628
MEETING, JUST ENOUGH TO GET HIM

537
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,295
OUT OF HERE.

538
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,172
ALL I KNOW IS DAY FOUR, I'M

539
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,131
JUST ABOUT... I GUESS I'M GOING

540
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,383
TO HAVE KEEP DIGGING DEEP AND GO

541
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,259
OVER THERE.

542
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,385
I FEEL LIKE IN ORDER FOR ME TO

543
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,054
MAKE A MOVE I HONESTLY BELIEVE I

544
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,138
HAVE TO HAVE SOME GIRLS.

545
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:42,149
THAT'S CASE IN POINT.

546
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,485
WE HAVE MORE ROPE HERE!

547
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,152
OH, HELLO.

548
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,862
I WANT TO TALK TO ALL OF

549
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,363
Y'ALL.

550
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,072
LIKE, I REALLY DO.

551
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:48,781
WHAT?

552
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,242
LIKE, I WANT EVERYONE TO HEAR ME

553
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,994
OKAY.

554
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,537
AGAIN, COLTON HAS SNAKED HIS

555
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,039
WAY BACK TO OUR DAMN CAMP.

556
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,374
I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS MORE

557
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,542
ESTROGEN IN HIS BODY THAN

558
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,544
TESTOSTERONE BUT I SWEAR, WHAT A

559
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,337
DRAMA QUEEN.

560
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,672
WE DON'T NEED THAT ENERGY.

561
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,548
LIKE, GO TO YOUR CAMP.

562
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,009
HERE'S THE DEAL.

563
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,053
THE REAL RAW DEAL.

564
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,764
I DON'T HEAR ABOUT GAME... I

565
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,473
DON'T CARE ABOUT GAME, I DON'T

566
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,101
CARE ABOUT STRATEGY, Y'ALL CAN

00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,229
SAYING.

569
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:20,604
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NO ONE ON

570
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,230
THIS ISLAND.

571
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:21,897
NOT ONE PERSON.

572
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,775
LET THAT'S NOT TRUE, THOUGH.

573
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,734
LET HIM FINISH.

574
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,568
THIS ISN'T FAKE.

575
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,569
THIS ISN'T ARTIFICIAL.

576
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,904
I SWEAR TO GOD ON MY LIFE.

577
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,447
IF Y'ALL WOULD LET ME STAY WITH

578
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,740
Y'ALL I WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT

579
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,574
YOU, YOU, YOU.

580
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,576
I WILL NOT TALK TO THEM
ABOUT Y'ALL

581
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,577
LIKE, I SWEAR...

582
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,329
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST

00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,457
COLTON'S JUST LIKE FICKLE

00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,292
CRAZINESS DRAMATIC AND NOW HE'S

585

586
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:43,961
IT'S JUST THE MORE HE COMES

587
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,921
OVER, THE MORE HE STARTS

588
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,589
BECOMING LIKE A JERK BY THE

589
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,298
MINUTE.

590
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,466
COLTON, HERE'S THE THING FROM

591
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,217

YOU AROUND, BUT YOU CAN

595
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,264
UNDERSTAND WE ARE TWO TRIBES.

596
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,598

LIKE LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD

609
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,325
WITHOUT HAVING A GUY WHO ACTS

610
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,870

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,227
PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THIS GAME BUT

REGROUP AND USE THE IDOL TO MY

640
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,198
ADVANTAGE.

641
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,324
COME HERE.

642
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,493

645
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:47,668
I'M PLAYING THIS AT THE NEXT

646
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,920

647
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,088
AND I'M NOT GOING HOME.

648
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,173
WHO GAVE YOU THAT IDOL?

649
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,424
THE GIRLS.

650
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,717
HOLY COW.

651
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,427
I JUST FOUND OUT SOME STUFF

652
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,680
TONIGHT AND IT'S LIKE MY HEART

653
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,723
IS POUNDING AND, YOU KNOW, I

654
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,018
FOUND OUT THAT COLTON HAS AN

655
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,063
IDOL AND WE'VE GOT TO GET RID OF

656
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,356
THE MUSCLE, MEANING MIKE AND

657
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,065
MATT.

658
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,192
THERE'S NO MORE TALKING ABOUT

659
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:12,609
THIS.

660
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,694
WE'RE SET, OKAY.

661
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,945
WE'RE SET.

662
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,740
SEE?

663
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,701
COLTON REACHES INTO HIS PANTS

664
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,411
AND HE'S GOT THIS FREAKING IDOL.

665
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,371
SO COLTON WENT FROM THE FIRST

666
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:30,127
GUY TO GET VOTED OUT TO NOW THE

667
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,919
RINGLEADER.

668
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,422
AND I MEAN I KNEW THE KID WAS A

669
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,925
FREAK OF NATURE AS FAR AS, LIKE,

670
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,304
THE KID IS RIDICULOUSLY SMART.

671
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,431
I HAVE TO MAKE MATT AND MIKE

672
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,432
BELIEVE I'M STILL WITH THEM

673
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,933
BECAUSE IF THEY GET SCARED

674
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,060
THEY'RE GONNA, LIKE, PULL

675
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:47,603
SOMETHING.

676
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:52,399
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

677
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,319
I'M ON BOARD WITH THE TROY,

678
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,280

680
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,450
OF PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

681
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,410
AND UNTIL I CAN GET WITH THE

682
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,953
GIRLS I HAVE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF

683
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,455
WITH THESE MISFITS.

684
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,582

HAVE CALLED THIS "SURVIVOR:

689
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,965
COLTON'S WORLD."

690
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,758
THIS IS IT.

691
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:24,848
THIS IS IT.

692
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:34,942

OVER WATER.

706
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,513

IF YOU FALL OFF, YOU GO BACK TO

THE START.

711
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,020
IF YOU TOUCH TWO PEOPLE AT ONCE

NICE AND SLOW.

742
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,693
Jeff: REMEMBER, YOU CAN

743
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,070
ONLY TOUCH ONE PERSON AT A TIME.

744
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:02,738
LEIF, LEIF, TOUCHING TWO PEOPLE,

745
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,073
GOT TO JUMP IN AND GO BACK.

746
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,742
IF YOU TOUCH TWO PEOPLE AT ONCE

747
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,869
THE PERSON CROSSING HAS TO JUMP

748
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,078
IN AND START OVER.

749
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,704
SO BE CAREFUL.

750
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,873
DON'T GRAB ME.

751
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,291
Jeff: EVEN INCIDENTAL CAN

752
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,000
COST YOU.

753
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,377

00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,347
CHRISTINA NOW GIVING IT A GO.

946
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:39,764
ALL THE WAY AROUND!

947
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,890
YOU GOT IT.

948
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,518
Jeff: TROY IS AROUND

949
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,227
MICHAEL.

950
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:44,519
CHRISTINA TRYING TO GET AROUND

951
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:48,982
KIM NOW.

952
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,525
TROY GETS AROUND MATT WITH NO

953
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:50,942
PROBLEM.

954
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,527
THIS IS IT.

955
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,362
MIKE HAS TO GET AROUND MATT AND

956
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,322
THIS CHALLENGE IS OVER.

957
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,740
THE WOMEN TRYING TO COME BACK.

958
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,742
BUT IT WILL BE TOO LITTLE; TOO

959
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,995
LATE IN THIS CHALLENGE.

960
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:02,829
MATT LEAD HIM BACK.

961
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,582
CAN HE HOLD ON?

962
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,750
AND HE DOES.

963
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:11,546
MIKE WILL CROSS AND MATT

964
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,005
CROSSES.

965
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:12,714
MEN WIN IMMUNITY!

966
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:21,765
(SCREAMING)

967
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:27,729
MEN, COME ON OVER AND GRAB IT.

968
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,314
GOOD JOB, MONICA.

969
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:29,898
YES!

970
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,900
Jeff: CONGRATULATIONS.

971
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,776
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

972
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,735
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

973
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,110
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

974
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,154
THANK GOD!

975
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:40,033
IT'S DEFINITELY THE BOOBS ARE

976
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:40,700
HARD.

977
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,242
Jeff: HARD TO SEE THEM WALK

978
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,119
OFF WITH IMMUNITY AGAIN.

979
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,746
NINA, YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD

980
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,413
IN DISGUST.

981
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,915
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT'S BEEN

982
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,041
GOING FOR US THIS WHOLE LAST

983
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,042
FIVE DAYS.

984
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,585
NO COMMUNICATION, NO TEAM WORK.

985
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,378
SAME OLD STORY.

986
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,588
WELL, THE RESULT IS THE SAME.

987
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,589
TRIBAL COUNCIL AGAIN TONIGHT.

988
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,757
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF

989
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,424
THIS TRIBE.

990
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,050
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE

991
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,760
OUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.

992
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,928
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

993
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,970
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

994
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,348
KAT JUMPED IN WHEN SHE DIDN'T

995
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,975
EVEN NEED TO JUMP IN-- NOT ONCE,

996
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:06,267
TWICE.

997
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,769
I'M SAD.

998
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,478
I'M SAD FOR WOMEN.

999
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,772
THIS ISN'T THE WAY WOMEN ARE AND

1000
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,898
FRANKLY I'M SO EMBARRASSED.

1001
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,005
ALL RIGHT.

1002
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:41,177
UM... EVERYBODY WANTS TO SAY

1003
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:41,803
SOMETHING.

1004
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,470
WHOEVER WANTS TO START.

1005
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,722
I'M SORRY FOR HAVING HORRIBLE

1006
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,432
COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

1007
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,599
I THOUGHT I COULD DO IT BUT IT

1008
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,308
WAS SO HARD.

1009
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:47,976
IT REALLY WAS.

1010
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,644
YOU GAVE IT A GOOD SHOT AND

1011
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,270
IT WAS HARD.

1012
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,813
I REALLY WANTED TO DO IT.

1013
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,648
KAT, I ALWAYS THINK OF YOU AS

1014
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:54,816
A LITTLE CRACKER JACK, SO IT'S

1015
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,483
OKAY.

1016
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,985
I ALWAYS STEP UP IN THE THAT

1017
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,987
ROLE REGARDLESS OF IF I'M

1018
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,113
ATHLETIC OR NOT BECAUSE I FEEL

1019
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,448
LIKE I ALWAYS WANT TO BRING IT.

1020
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,991
I ALWAYS WANT TO BRING THE TRIBE

1021
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,367
TO NUMBER ONE YOU KNOW?

1022
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,076
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS WANT.

1023
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,998
YOU'RE VERY MUCH OF A RAH-RAH

1024
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,082
GIRL AND WE NEED THAT.

1025
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,293
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY LOGIC

1026
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,878
AND STRATEGY TRUMPS RAH-RAH.

1027
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,088
SO DO THAT ON THE INSIDE AND

1028
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,300
LISTEN FOR STRATEGY.

1029
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,050
KAT, I REALLY LIKE HER ENERGY,

1030
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,845
BUT IT NEEDS TO BE CHANNELED.

1031
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,388
WE WANT TO TRY TO KEEP THINGS

1032
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,015
CONTROLLED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE--

1033
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,392
AT LEAST I DO IF I'M BEING THE

1034
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,894
LEADER-- AND KAT IS VERY YOUNG

1035
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,853
AND EMOTIONAL.

1036
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,688
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING

1037
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,522
EMOTIONAL IF YOU CAN CONTROL IT

1038
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,148
BUT SHE CAN'T CONTROL IT AT ALL

1039
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,193
AND THAT'S A LIABILITY.

1040
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,861
HOWEVER, NINA IS LIKE THE

1041
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,697
WALKING DEAD AROUND HERE.

1042
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,240
SHE KNOWS HER HEAD IS ON THE

1043
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,533
CHOPPING BLOCK.

1044
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,242
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK IT

1045
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,660
WAS ONE PERSON'S FAULT TODAY AT

1046
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,036
ALL BECAUSE THAT REALLY WASN'T

1047
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,497
THE CASE.

1048
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,498
BUT TONIGHT'S GOING TO END LIKE

1049
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,249
THE OTHER NIGHTS, IN TRIBAL

1050
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,503
COUNCIL, SO THAT'S THE SUCKY

1051
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,128
PART.

1052
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,379
WE DIDN'T LOSE, WE GOT OUR

1053
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,088
ASS KICKED.

1054
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,465
IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE AND

1055
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:00,882
EVERYONE'S LIKE "OH, KAT, YOU

1056
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,009
DID SO GOOD."

1057
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,678
KAT, YOU JUMPED IN THE WATER

1058
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,805
TWICE, YOU DUMB BLOND!

1059
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,932
TWICE!

1060
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:09,891
INEXCUSABLE.

1061
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,892
COME ON!

1062
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:15,897
QUIT BEING SUCH A DUMB BROAD!

1063
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,065
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE.

1064
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:17,732
I'M SORRY...

1065
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,900
IT'S ME, YOU AND CHRISTINA.

1066
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,567
WE'RE OUT.

1067
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,151
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO

1068
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:20,860
MAKE IT OUT.

1069
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,571
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ORDER.

1070
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,113
ME, YOU AND CHRISTINA ARE OUT OF

1071
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:24,781
HERE.

1072
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,783
I'M VOTING FOR KAT BECAUSE I

1073
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,700
CAN'T STAND HER.

1074
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,078
I THINK SHE'S A COMPLETE IDIOT.

1075
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,704
NOT ONCE JUMPING IN THE WATER AT

1076
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,413
THE WRONG TIME, TWICE.

1077
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,374
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, KAT.

1078
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,083
IT'S JUST...

1079
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,460
I'M SO LOW ON THE TOTEM POLE,

1080
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,254
HOW DO I POSSIBLY GO TO SOMEBODY

1081
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,964
IN THE FIVE AND SAY "WOULD YOU

1082
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,131
GUYS BE INTERESTED IN GETTING

1083
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,717
RID OF KAT"?

1084
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,094
THAT'S A ONE-WAY TICKET HOME.

1085
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,053
SO I'M HOPING THEY'LL OPEN THEIR

1086
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,055
EYES BUT WHO KNOWS WITH THIS

1087
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:49,430
GROUP.

1088
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,141
WHO KNOWS?

1089
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,728
WE ARE IN A TRIBE OF THE IT

1090
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,438
WITH IT WITHLESS.

1091
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,940
WE ARE A WITHLESS TRIBE AND WE

1092
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,733
ARE BEING LED BY 20

1093
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,609
SOMETHING-YEAR-OLD WOMEN AND

1094
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,110
THEY ARE...

1095
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,403
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

1096
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,530
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

1097
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,281
AND I HAVE TO HEAR KAT RUN

1098
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,074
HER MOUTH ONE MORE TIME... THAT

1099
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,742
DUMBER THAN DUMB...

1100
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,410
SHE SHOULD BE GOING TONIGHT.

1101
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:20,169
SHE SHOULD BE GOING TONIGHT.

1102
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,130
IT SUCKS.

1103
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,464
IT DOES.

1104
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:28,344
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

1105
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,805
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

1106
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:31,806
OH, MY GOSH, KAT!

1107
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,099
SHE SHOULD BE GOING HOME.

1108
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:38,104
SHE'S BEEN REALLY RUINING THIS

1109
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:38,730
TRIBE.

1110
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,023
I KNOW SHE'S FUN BUT SHE'S

1111
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,150
RUINING IT.

1112
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:42,817
IGNORANT.

1113
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,152
OUT LAST, OUT WITH, BUT YOU

1114
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,323
CAN'T WHEN YOU'RE IT HAVELESS.

1115
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,991
YOU'RE TOO SMART TO LET THIS

1116
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,700
HAPPEN.

1117
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,784
WE CAN REDEEM OURSELVES BECAUSE

1118
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,328
RIGHT NOW WE LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.

1119
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,496
TRUST ME, I'VE BEEN

1120
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,831
EMBARRASSED SINCE I'VE BEEN

1121
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:57,290
HERE.

1122
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,541
LET'S FIX IT!

1123
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,001
I'M WRITING DOWN KAT'S NAME.

1124
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:06,007
I WAS GOING TO ANYWAY.

1125
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,052
I JUST TALKED TO NINA, OF

1126
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:09,761
COURSE.

1127
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,806
SHE... I MEAN... SHE'S REALLY...

1128
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,018
I MEAN, SHE'S REALLY RIGHT ABOUT

1129
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:17,644
KAT.

1130
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,187
KAT MAKES US ALL OUT TO BE

1131
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,480
FREAKING IDIOTS.

1132
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,815
AND I KNOW WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

1133
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,069
NUMBERS, BUT WHAT IF... IF WE

1134
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:26,694
VOTED KAT OUT.

1135
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,614
ALL EYES ARE ON KAT RIGHT

1136
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,323
NOW.

1137
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,532
WE'RE STARTING TO LOOK AT THE

1138
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,825
WEAKER PLAYERS EVEN IF THEY'RE

1139
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,494
IN OUR ALLIANCE.

1140
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,870
I'M ONE OF THE STRONGEST PEOPLE

1141
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,580
IN THE TRIBE SO IF WE DECIDE TO

1142
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,832
START PICKING OFF THE WEAKEST

1143
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,585
LINKS, KAT WILL BE OUR PICK.

1144
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,672
IT KILLS ME TO TALK TO NINA

1145
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,881
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING

1146
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:47,215
SHE'S SAYING.

1147
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,050
I DO, TOO.

1148
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:49,467
AND I KNOW KAT BLEW THE

1149
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,176
CHALLENGE TODAY.

1150
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,680
I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU ON THAT.

1151
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,264
I JUST FEEL NINA DESERVES TO BE

1152
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,391
HERE MORE THAN KAT.

1153
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,268
I'M WITH YOU SO I'M

1154
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,561
RESPECTING YOU IN THIS IDEA.

1155
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,270
I JUST THINK WE NEED THESE GIRLS

1156
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,106
TO TRUST US.

1157
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:13,199
I DON'T KNOW.

1158
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:33,428
I DON'T KNOW.

1159
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,470
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1160
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,889
LET'S GIVE TONIGHT'S TRIBAL SOME

1161
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,557
CONTEXT.

1162
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,641
WE'RE ONLY FIVE DAYS IN BUT

1163
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,892
YOU'RE OFF TO ONE OF THE WORST

1164
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,644
STARTS EVER IN THIS GAME BECAUSE

1165
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,897
OF THE ABSOLUTE AND TOTAL

1166
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,107
DYSFUNCTION WITHIN THIS GROUP.

1167
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,734
KIM, WHAT DO YOU BRING INTO THIS

1168
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,443
GAME?

1169
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:48,776
WHAT COULD HELP RIGHT NOW FROM

1170
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,277
YOUR LIFE?

1171
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,320
I THINK I'M A GOOD

1172
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,613
COMMUNICATOR AND I FEEL LIKE

1173
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,115
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED.

1174
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:54,741
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A

1175
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,451
PLACE FOR MY VOICE YET.

1176
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,952
Jeff: IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'M

1177
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,121
TALKING TO SIXTH GRADERS SAYING

1178
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,122
"HEY, EVERYBODY, IF YOU HAD A

1179
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,623
GROUP OF PEOPLE AND YOU HAD TO

1180
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,291
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, WHAT MIGHT

1181
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,626
BE ONE THING YOU WOULD DO?"

1182
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,919
AND SOMEBODY SAYS "WE COULD TALK

1183
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,921
ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW."

1184
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:09,464
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HASN'T

1185
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,132
HAPPENED YET, NINA.

1186
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,134
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF

1187
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,594
THAT INFORMATION ABOUT ALL OF US

1188
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,595
DOESN'T GET OUT BECAUSE WE'RE

1189
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,138
STILL A DIVIDED TRIBE.

1190
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,765
THERE'S FIVE AGAINST THREE.

1191
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,933
Jeff: WHO ARE THE FIVE.

1192
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,978
SABRINA, CHELSEA, ALICIA, KAT

1193
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,146
AND KIM.

1194
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,773
Jeff: AND THAT LEAVES YOU,

1195
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,566
NINA, WITH CHRISTINA AND MONICA?

1196
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,026
CORRECT.

1197
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:30,735
Jeff: WELL, DOES EVERYONE

1198
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,320
HERE KNOW, FOR INSTANCE, ABOUT

1199
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,154
YOUR BACKGROUND?

1200
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,239
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SHARED

1201
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,991
WITH SOME MEMBERS OF THIS TRIBE

1202
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:37,700
MY LIFE EXPERIENCE.

1203
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,452
I WAS A POLICE OFFICER FOR THE

1204
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,621
CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR 13

1205
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,330
YEARS.

1206
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,206
WITH THAT BRINGS THE ABILITY TO

1207
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,541
DEAL UNDER PRESSURE AND TO BE

1208
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,334
PHYSICAL SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

1209
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,711
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT LIFE

1210
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,213
EXPERIENCE KAT BRINGS TO THIS

1211
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,673
GROUP.

1212
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,716
Jeff: KAT?

1213
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,968
I MEAN, I'M OUT DOORS AND I

1214
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,178
DO SALES AND I WORK WITH PEOPLE

1215
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:03,476
ALL THE TIME AND, UM,...

1216
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,977
Jeff: IT WOULDN'T BE

1217
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,687
UNREASONABLE OF YOU, KAT, TO SAY

1218
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,980
"I'M YOUNG, MY LIFE EXPERIENCE

1219
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:08,773
IS LIMITED."

1220
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:09,315
OF COURSE, I'VE NEVER DONE

1221
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,316
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

1222
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,527
I'M YOUNG, THIS IS A NEW

1223
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,736
EXPERIENCE FOR ME, PERIOD.

1224
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,530
I'M THE YOUNGEST PERSON ON

1225
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:15,947
THE TRIBE.

1226
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,740
AND I'M OLD.

1227
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,991
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS, EITHER.

1228
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,743
OKAY, I'M THE YOUNGEST PERSON

1229
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,202
ON THIS TRIBE AND I'M DOING THE

1230
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:21,869
BEST I CAN.

1231
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,038
EVEN TODAY, LIKE, WITH OUR

1232
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:24,747
CHALLENGE I WAS SO EXCITED AND

1233
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,207
THE WORST FEELING IN THE WHOLE

1234
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,333
WORLD IS TO LET YOUR TRIBE DOWN.

1235
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,837
AND I DID.

1236
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,379
TODAY.

1237
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,839
Jeff: NINA YOU LOOK LIKE

1238
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,383
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BURST SO MUCH IS

1239
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,050
READY TO COME OUT.

1240
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,260
WELL, KAT IS ALWAYS TELLING

1241
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,553
US WHAT A GREAT ATHLETE SHE IS.

1242
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,679
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

1243
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,013
ATHLETE IS MADE UP OF THREE

1244
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,223
THINGS: ATHLETIC ABILITY, THE

1245
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:42,640
ABILITY TO HANDLE PRESSURE AND

1246
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,226
TO BE SMART.

1247
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,769
OKAY, SO TODAY NOT ONLY DID SHE

1248
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,771
JUMP IN THE WATER ONCE, SHE DID

1249
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,689
IT TWICE.

1250
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,233
AND THE ONLY VOICE I HEARD UP

1251
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,276
THERE, DISTRACTING VOICE, WAS

1252
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:53,985
HERS.

1253
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,361
SO SHE CAN'T HANDLE STRESS AND

1254
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,572
SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

1255
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,073
IS SHE AN ATHLETE?

1256
00:35:59,156 --> 00:35:59,782
I DON'T KNOW.

1257
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,324
BUT THERE'S THREE COMPONENTS AND

1258
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,410
SHE'S FAILED AT TWO.

1259
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,744
Jeff: KIM, IS PART OF

1260
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,163
WHAT'S GOING ON THAT THERE'S AN

1261
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:06,789
ALLIANCE FORMED?

1262
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,249
I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT.

1263
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:08,875
DOES KAT BRING LIFE EXPERIENCE

1264
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,043
TO THE TABLE IN OUR TRIBE?

1265
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:11,711
NO.

1266
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:12,879
BUT I DO THINK KAT IS A GOOD

1267
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,421
ATHLETE.

1268
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,089
DO I THINK NINA HAS LIFE

1269
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:15,506
EXPERIENCE?

1270
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,215
ABSOLUTELY.

1271
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:16,924
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S BRINGING

1272
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,467
DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE TABLE

1273
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,052
THAN KAT IS AND THAT'S THE

1274
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,429
DECISION WE'RE WEIGHING OUT HERE

1275
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,054
TONIGHT.

1276
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,097
Jeff: SO IT'S BETWEEN NINA

1277
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:23,764
AND KAT.

1278
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,725
THAT'S BEEN THE VIBE TODAY.

1279
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,059
Jeff: CHELSEA, IF YOU COULD

1280
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,561
START OVER, DO YOU THINK YOU

1281
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,146
GUYS WOULD FORM DIFFERENT

1282
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:30,771
ALLIANCES.

1283
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,108
YEAH, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE

1284
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:34,775
DIFFERENT.

1285
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,776
Jeff: SABRINA, DO YOU AGREE

1286
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,319
WITH THAT?

1287
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,403
YES, 100%.

1288
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,280
Jeff: ALICIA, THERE'S NO

1289
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,616
GIRL POWER GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

1290
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,451
NO YOUNG WOMEN AT HOME GOING "GO

1291
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,285
WOMEN'S TRIBE!"

1292
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,745
NO, THERE'S NOT.

1293
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,329
Jeff: IS THAT EMBARRASSING?

1294
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,457
IT'S VERY EMBARRASSING,

1295
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,083
ESPECIALLY THAT CHALLENGE.

1296
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:51,792
MONICA FIGURED IT OUT BUT

1297
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,586
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS TALKING WE

1298
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,296
COULDN'T HEAR MONICA'S

1299
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:55,963
SUGGESTION.

1300
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,297
AND IT WAS EMBARRASSING TO

1301
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:56,631
WATCH.

1302
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,090
MY FAULT.

1303
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,635
IT WAS MY FAULT.

1304
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,928
Jeff: YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

1305
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:02,929
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT OR ARE YOU

1306
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:03,804
JUST BEING A MARTER?

1307
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,599
I THINK I DO.

1308
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:12,313
IT SUCKS.

1309
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,776
Jeff: WHAT'S UPSETTING?

1310
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,487
MY COMMUNICATION SKILLS, I

1311
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:19,904
GUESS.

1312
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,490
AND FAILING.

1313
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,659
I NEVER FAIL.

1314
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,326
Jeff: YOU'VE NEVER FAILED

1315
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,328
AT ANYTHING IN LIFE?

1316
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,871
I USUALLY DON'T TRY ANYTHING

1317
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,373
UNLESS I KNOW I'M GOING TO

1318
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,124
SUCCEED, PUT IT THAT WAY.

1319
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,793
Jeff: SO YOU REALLY CAN'T

1320
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,544
SAY YOU'VE NEVER FAILED BECAUSE

1321
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,838
THE TRUTH IS YOU'VE NEVER PUT

1322
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,215
YOURSELF IN A POSITION TO FAIL.

1323
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:39,632
YEAH.

1324
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,842
IT HURTS.

1325
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,636
Jeff: SO, KAT, YOU SAID YOU

1326
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,804
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

1327
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,471
LOSS.

1328
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,472
WOULD IT BE FAIR TO VOTE YOU

1329
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:46,847
OUT?

1330
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,684
ABSOLUTELY.

1331
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,352
I THOUGHT I COULD DO IT.

1332
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,354
I THOUGHT I COULD BRING IT HOME.

1333
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,981
WHAT I CAN ONLY HOPE IS THAT MY

1334
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:55,815
TRIBE BELIEVES IN ME THE WAY

1335
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,650
THAT I BELIEVE IN MYSELF AND

1336
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,568
THEY'LL KEEP ME AROUND SO I CAN

1337
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,029
SHOW THEM THAT I'M LEARNING.

1338
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:02,738
YOU KNOW?

1339
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,450
I'M NOT CALLING CHRISTINA OUT

1340
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,036
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE IF THAT, IF

1341
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,704
ANYTHING, COULD BE HERE TO JUST

1342
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,165
BE HERE AS OPPOSED TO PLAY THE

1343
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:13,749
GAME.

1344
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,710
Jeff: CHRISTINA, SHE JUST

1345
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,669
THREE YOU UNDER THE BUS.

1346
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,213
YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE IT IN AND

1347
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:19,797
YOU MOVE ON.

1348
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,674
CAN I JUST JUMP IN IF?

1349
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,758
SEE, THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF

1350
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,552
HOW MEN AND WOMEN COMMUNICATE

1351
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,261
DIFFERENTLY.

1352
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:25,970
WE'RE KIND OF TIPTOEING AND TAP

1353
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,847
DANCING AROUND AND THAT CAUSES A

1354
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,182
RIFT AND IT CAUSES EMOTION.

1355
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:30,850
I MAN WOULD HAVE CALLED ANOTHER

1356
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,268
MAN OUT AND THEY WOULD HAVE

1357
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,396
DEALT WITH IT AND BE DONE WITH

1358
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,897
IT, NO MANY "B."

1359
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,232
Jeff: NINA, DOES THIS GIVE

1360
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:39,567
YOU A FEELING OF HOPE HEARING

1361
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,568
THAT WELL, NOW HERE'S CHRISTINA,

1362
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,570
SOMEBODY ELSE YOU SHOULD GET RID

1363
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,571
OF BEFORE ME.

1364
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:43,904
SHE DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO PLAY

1365
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,280
THE GAME.

1366
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,906
ABSOLUTELY.

1367
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,408
BECAUSE I DO BRING LIFE

1368
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,743
EXPERIENCE, I AM PHYSICAL AND I

1369
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,410
HAVE PLENTY OF ENERGY.

1370
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:53,914
AND THEY KNOW THAT.

1371
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,916
Jeff: WITH THAT, IT IS TIME

1372
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,209
TO VOTE.

1373
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:07,261
MONICA, YOU'RE UP.

1374
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:15,227
MONICA, YOU'RE UP.

1375
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,772
NINA, I THINK YOU'RE A STRONG

1376
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,606
COMPETITOR BUT I WOULD NEVER

1377
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,857
THROW YOU UNDER THE BUS THE WAY

1378
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:30,451
YOU DID ME.

1379
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,745
KAT, I'VE ALREADY SAID MY

1380
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,579
REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

1381
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,664
THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH SHENANIGANS

1382
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,625
AROUND CAMP AND IT'S JUST TIME

1383
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:47,718
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

1384
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:53,349
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

1385
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,475
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1386
00:39:54,558 --> 00:40:03,317
VOTES.

1387
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,111
Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A

1388
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,112
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

1389
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,279
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE

1390
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:11,325
THE TIME TO DO SO.

1391
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:11,992
OKAY.

1392
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:12,701
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1393
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,661
DECISION IS FINAL.

1394
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,954
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1395
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,539
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1396
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,081
IMMEDIATELY.

1397
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,625
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1398
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:24,547

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:31,679

SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1411

THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1412
00:40:53,242 --> 00:41:01,000
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1413
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:06,046
NINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1414
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:16,056
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1415
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,351
WELL, WE ARE ONLY FIVE DAYS IN,

00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,394
