1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,923
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
SURVIVOR, THE MAJORITY HAD PLAN

2
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:07,507
OF ATTACK.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,759
>> AURORA HAS GOOD TO GO.

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,220
>> Jeff: BUT WARDOG WANTED TO
SHAKE UP THE GAME.

5
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,388
>> VOTE KELLEY TONIGHT.

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,433
IT'S TIME TO MAKE A MOVE ON THE
LAST RETURNING PLAYER, AND

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,936
THAT'S KELLEY WENTWORTH.

8
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:24,941
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL WARDOG LEFT
LAUREN IN THE DARK AND BETRAYED

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,484
HIS CLOSEST ALLY.

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,738
>> A LOT OF LYING GOING ON.

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,447
>> Jeff: WHEN HE VOTED OUT
WENTWORTH.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,286
WENTWORTH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,330
AND SHE GRABBED THE TORCH AND
HEADED TO THE EDGE OF

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,458
EXTINCTION.

15
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,767
>> DOWN TO EIGHT.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,685
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL SUCKED.

17
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,773
IT'S REALLY SAD THE LOSE KELLEY,
NOT JUST ON LIKE A "SURVIVOR"

18
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,984
LEVEL WITH SOMEONE WHO I
GENUINELY TRUSTED, BUT ON A

19
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:12,113
PERSONAL LEVEL, SHE FELT LIKE MY
OLDER SISTER.

20
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,325
SO I'LL JUST BE FIRST TO SAY
ANYBODY WANT TO... OBVIOUSLY TWO

21
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,534
PEOPLE FLIPPED.

22
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,038
I THINK I CAN GUESS WHO IT IS,
BUT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO SAY IT?

23
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,164
>> RON AND WARDOG.

24
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,749
>> RON AND WARDOG?

25
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,835
I'M SO ANGRY AND SO MAD AT
WARDOG.

26
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,505
I ACTUALLY KIND OF FEEL LIKE I'M
OUT FOR FLOOD.

27
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,341
AT THE SAME TIME, I ALSO WANT
THE TAKE RICK OUT JUST BECAUSE

28
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:35,178
RICK POSES A THREAT TO EVERYONE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO

29
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,346
WORK WITH ME ANYMORE.

30
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,017
I THINK I CAN GET OTHERS TO
RALLY BEHIND ME, BUT IT IS THIS

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,148
WEIRD FEELING OF I DON'T KNOW
WHERE PEOPLE STAND ANYMORE.

32
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,694
>> IT WAS MICE BEING IN ON IT
INSTEAD OF BEING ON THE OUTS.

33
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,862
BUT THAT'S PART OF IT.

34
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,658
>> WHEN YOU SAY TO ME, I JUST
WISH I WAS IN ON IT, YOU ONLY

35
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,993
WISH YOU WERE IN ON IT AFTER THE
VOTES WERE DONE.

36
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,037
>> I THOUGHT WE STILL COULD HAVE
WAITED.

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,915
>> BECAUSE KELLEY HAD ALLIES.

38
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,416
IF ANYTHING I COULDN'T TAKE
KELLEY OUT.

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,210
>> YOU HAD ALLIES ALSO.

40
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,839
>> THERE WAS NO WAIT, BECAUSE I
DON'T THINK YOU WERE GOING TO

41
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,215
FLIP ON HER.

42
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,424
YOU GO WHERE THE NUMBERS GO.

43
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,386
>> I THOUGHT ME, YOU AND RON
WERE THE TIGHTEST.

44
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,388
>> I TRUSTED WARDOG 100%.

45
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,850
GOING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL, I
FELT REALLY CONFIDENT IN MY

46
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,976
GAME.

47
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,353
I WAS LEFT OUT OF THE VOTE, SO
NOW I KNOW THAT BRIDGE IS

48
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,104
BURNED.

49
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,565
WARDOG IS JUST BARKING OUT
ORDERS.

50
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,233
WARDOG TALKED TO ME LIKE A DOG.

51
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:30,900
I AIN'T HAVING THAT.

52
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,069
>> RIGHT NOW I'M UPSET, GAVIN.

53
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,363
YOU LIKE TO STAY WITH THE
NUMBERS ALL THE WAY.

54
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,573
YOU DON'T LIKE ROCKING THE BOAT.

55
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,703
>> YOU CAN'T BE BARKING OUT
ORDERS 24/7 AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO

56
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,620
WORK WITH YOU.

57
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,705
HE'S NEXT ON MY LIST.

58
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,748
I WANT WARDOG OUT NOW.

59
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:50,545
I HATE THAT WARDOG GOT AS PISSED
AS HE DID.

60
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,212
-HE GOT PISSED HERE.

61
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,090
>> HE TALKED TO ME LIKE A DOG.

62
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,258
>> OH, MY GOD.

63
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,512
>> I'D RATHER MAKE BIG MOVES
WITH YOU ALL THAN BE TALKED TO

64
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,388
LIKE A DOG.

65
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,306
I AIN'T ABOUT THAT LIFE.

66
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,266
I FEEL LIKE I'M NEXT ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.

67
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,267
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

68
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,477
>> WELL, NOT IN MY MIND, BUDDY.

69
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:11,107
>> I WAS WORKING WITH WARDOG TO
GET OUT KELLEY, BUT THEN I'M

70
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,442
THINKING, HE'S A LOOSE CANNON.

71
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,277
HE SAYS TOO MUCH.

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,740
HE TALKED TO GAVIN LIKE GAVIN
WAS TEN YEARS OLD, AND IT REALLY

73
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,949
HURT GAVIN'S FEELING.

74
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,368
IT'S PERFECT BECAUSE IT CUT
THOSE TWO IN HALF.

75
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,496
>> I'LL DO WHATEVER, MAKE A MOVE
WHEREVER YOU GUYS WANT, AND I'M

76
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,249
AN EASY VOTE FOR IT.

77
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,959
SO APPRECIATE YOU GUYS.

78
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,004
>> I FEEL LIKE MY GAME IS GOING
PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE I HAVE LOTS

79
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,298
OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND I'M
TRYING THE PLAY BOTH SIDES.

80
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,300
THE ONLY THING I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT WAS JULIE, BECAUSE SHE'S

81
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:46,434
THE ONE I NEED TO MEND FENCES
WITH.

82
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,019
>> I'M IN THE LIKE THAT.

83
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,979
I'M NOT SUPER EMOTIONAL.

84
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,356
AS EMOTIONAL AS I AM IN THIS
GAME --

85
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,649
>> I FEEL SO BAD.

86
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:58,363
>> BUT IT'S WETTER -- BETTER FOR
US NOT TO ALWAYS VOTE TOGETHER.

87
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:02,784
>> I'M WITH YOU, AND I HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU.

88
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,327
AURORA GAVE ME HER EXTRA VOTE TO
SHOW TRUST.

89
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,121
IT'S STILL HER, BUT I HAVE IT.

90
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,666
IF SHE HAD GONE HOME TONIGHT, I
WAS GOING TO USE IT.

91
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,292
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

92
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,502
>> NO.

93
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,713
>> I TOLD JULIE ABOUT THE EXTRA
VOTE, BECAUSE I NEED JULIE TO

94
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,008
FEEL CONFIDENT AND TRUST ME SO
THAT SHE'S COMPLETELY LOYAL TO

95
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,009
ME.

96
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,178
>> I'LL WATCH YOU BACK AS LONG
AS YOU WATCH MINE.

97
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,513
>> I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU UNTIL
THE END.

98
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:28,059
>> I DO WANT TO WORK WITH YOU,
TOO.

99
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,352
YOU'RE WITH ME, I'M WITH YOU.

100
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,647
>> EVEN THOUGH I CLEARLY WAS
LEFT OUT OF TONIGHT'S VOTE, I

101
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,523
DON'T BLAME RON AT ALL.

102
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,858
IT WAS A GOOD MOVE.

103
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,694
I HAVE NO HARD FEELINGS AGAINST
RON.

104
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,363
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON IN THE GAME
I FEEL LIKE I CAN TRULY TRUST.

105
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:53,376
I DO THINK HE HAS MY BACK.

106
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,213
>> NICE.

107
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,716
>> THERE'S A LOT OF LYING GOING
ON.

108
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,011
>> AT TRIBAL LAST NIGHT, RON,
MYSELF, AND WARDOG VOTED

109
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,512
TOGETHER TO GET RID OF KELLEY.

110
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,891
AND NO ONE WAS HAPPIER THAN ME
THAT KELLEY WENTWORTH WAS HEADED

111
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,226
TO THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,565
SO RON AND WARDOG AND I KIND OF
NEED EACH OTHER.

113
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:22,572
SO HERE'S A REALIZATION THAT I
HAD, OKAY, THAT WE'RE THE ONLY

114
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,906
THREATS IN PLAYERS IN THE GAME.

115
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,741
>> YEAH.

116
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,535
>> WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WITH THE
RESUME.

117
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,745
>> YEAH.

118
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,705
>> I THINK THOSE GIRLS HAVEN'T
BEEN PLAYERS, BUT THEY'RE GOING

119
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,375
TO WANT TO BUILD THEIR RESUME,
AND NONE OF THEM ARE GOING TO

120
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:34,959
TAKE US TO THE END.

121
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,669
>> I AM TOTALLY WITH THAT.

122
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,755
I DON'T WANT EITHER ONE OF YOU
ALL GONE.

123
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,758
IF WE TURN ON EACH OTHER TOO
SOON, NONE OF US GET.

124
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,593
THERE WE ALL AGREE ON THAT.

125
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,095
WE'RE EACH OTHER'S BIGGEST
THREAT AND OUR ONLY HOPE.

126
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,346
>> I HEAR YOU.

127
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,601
>> WARDOG HAS BEEN MY NEMESIS IN
THIS GAME, BUT NOW WE NEED EACH

128
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,771
OTHER GOING FORWARD AS A SHIELD,
BECAUSE AS SOON AS ONE OF US

129
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,773
GOES OUT, IT WILL BE A FEEDING
FRENZY.

130
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,068
I SEE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT
BUILT MUMP OF A RESUME STARTING

131
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,945
TO BUILD THEIR RESUME BY GETTING
RID OF ONE THREAT AFTER THE

132
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,654
OTHER.

133
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,947
>> WE GOT TO TAKE THE GIRLS OUT.

134
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,325
>> THE THREE OF US GET RID OF
AURORA.

135
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,409
>> TAKE AURORA OUT.

136
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,078
>> AND THEN JUST WORK IT FROM
THERE.

137
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:14,415
>> AURORA IS DEFINITELY ON THE
BOTTOM.

138
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,625
SHE'S AN EASY VOTE.

139
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,961
BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN NAMED EVERY
TRIBAL, EVERYONE WAS GOING FOR

140
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,504
AURORA.

141
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,088
SHE'S A BIG COMPETITOR.

142
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,924
SHE'S A CHALLENGE BEAST.

143
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,759
AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT SHE'S
GOING TO SAY AT TRIBAL.

144
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,429
>> THE ONLY WAY WE CAN PROTECT
EACH OTHER IS IF WE STAY

145
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,639
TOGETHER.

146
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,974
SO I THINK THE THREE OF US NEED
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY WE STAY.

147
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,184
>> YEAH.

148
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,978
>> THE GAME I'M PLAYING RIGHT
NOW IS RON IS EVERYONE'S ALLY,

149
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,647
AND IF I DON'T WORK WITH YOU
RIGHT NOW, MAYBE NEXT TIME.

150
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,820
>> WE HAVE TO CONVINCE THEM TO
VOTE OUT A LESSER THREAT AS

151
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,154
OPPOSED TO A BIGGER THREAT.

152
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,489
THAT COULD BE TRICKY.

153
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,201
>> WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER FOR
AT LEAST A FEW MORE VOTES.

154
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,621
>> IF WE TAKE AURORA OUT, THERE
IS NO PLOT AGAINST HER.

155
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,624
>> THE ROAD AHEAD OF ME WILL BE
DIFFICULT.

156
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,169
EITHER WAY I CAN JOIN EITHER
ALLIANCE.

157
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,380
SO I'VE GOT A TOUGH DECISION TO
MAKE.

158
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,632
I LOVE HAVING POWER AND CONTROL.

159
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,676
AND IT PUTS ME IN THE MIDDLE
AGAIN WHERE I GET TO MAKE A

160
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:15,268
DECISION.

161
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,317
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

162
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,363
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S REWARD
CHALLENGE.

163
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:30,825
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO SWIM OUT TO A PLATFORM,

164
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:35,037
RUN ACROSS IT, JUMP IN, PULL
YOURSELF UNDER THE PLATFORM,

165
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,664
RETRIEVE A RING, AND RACE TO THE
FINISH.

166
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,542
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THREE RINGS,
YOU'LL ATTEMPT TO LAND THEM ON

167
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:45,756
THREE TARGETS.

168
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,592
FIRST FOUR FINISH WIN REWARD.

169
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,385
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

170
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,553
>> YES.

171
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,891
>> Jeff: YOU'LL BE TAKEN FROM
HERE TO THE SABATO MUD BATHS

172
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,228
WHERE YOU WILL ENJOY SANDWICH,
CHICKEN, SHREDDED PORK, ROAST

173
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,899
BEEF, SALAD, WINE, JUICE, AND
BROWNIES FOR DESSERT.

174
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,192
>> OH, MY GOD.

175
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,903
>> Jeff: TREAT YOUR BODY BOTH
INSIDE AND OUT.

176
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,570
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

177
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,487
>> YES.

178
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,907
>> Jeff: WE'RE GOING TO DO A
SCHOOLYARD PICK.

179
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,742
>> LET'S DO THIS!

180
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:18,748
>> ALL RIGHT!

181
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,582
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

182
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,210
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.

183
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:27,882
FOR BLUE, IT IS LAUREN, WARDOG,
DEVENS, AND JULIE.

184
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:32,762
FOR YELLOW IT'S RON, AURORA,
GAVIN, AND VICTORIA.

185
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,931
FOR REWARD, HERE WE GO.

186
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,433
SURVIVORS READY?

187
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:43,105
GO!

188
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,107
WARDOG OFF THE A SLIPPERY START.

189
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,651
>> GOOD JOB, WARDOG.

190
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,818
>> GOOD JOB, RON.

191
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,861
>> WARDOG.

192
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,615
>> Jeff: WARDOG IS SWIMMING TO
THE WRONG PLATFORM.

193
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,908
>> WATCH OUT, WARDOG.

194
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,700
YOU'RE GOING TO WRONG WAY.

195
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,827
>> TO YOUR RIGHT.

196
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,120
TO YOUR RIGHT, WARDOG.

197
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:58,955
>> Jeff: RON GETS THERE FIRST.

198
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,123
YOU HAVE TO GET UP AND RACE
ACROSS IT.

199
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,124
>> COME ON, RON.

200
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:02,959
PUSH IT, BROTHER.

201
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,834
>> Jeff: GET ACROSS.

202
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:17,139
JUMP IN AND PULL YOURSELF UNDER.

203
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:24,981
WARDOG AND RON COME UP FOR AIR.

204
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,815
WARDOG IS THERE.

205
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,315
RON IS THERE.

206
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,650
>> GOOD JOB, WARDOG.

207
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,819
>> THAT ABOY, RON.

208
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,696
>> Jeff: NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
UNTIE ONE RING.

209
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,781
>> ONE RING.

210
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,949
>> THAT'S IT, BUDDY.

211
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,325
>> Jeff: WARDOG HAS HIS.

212
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,493
RON HAS HIS.

213
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,494
WARDOG IN THE WATER FIRST.

214
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:38,995
THERE GOES RON.

215
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,288
>> NICE, RON.

216
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,540
>> YOU GOT THIS, DOG.

217
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,501
>> Jeff: YOU GOT TO GET BACK
ON THE PLATFORM BEFORE THE NEXT

218
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,168
PERSON CAN GO.

219
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,795
>> COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

220
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,797
>> Jeff: GAVIN PULLS UP RON.

221
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,675
GO, YELLOW!

222
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,678
GO, BLUE!

223
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,349
IT'S AURORA WHIPPING THROUGH THE
WATER.

224
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,852
>> GO, AURORA.

225
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:08,357
>> Jeff: AURORA IS ON FIRE.

226
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,025
LAUREN BACK UP NOW.

227
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:14,864
>> GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB.

228
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,575
>> Jeff: LAUREN TRYING TO STAY
IN IT.

229
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,075
SHE'S BACK IN THE WATER.

230
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,368
>> GOOD JOB, LAUREN.

231
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,244
GOOD JOB.

232
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:24,665
>> Jeff: AURORA DOES NOT COME
UP FOR AIR.

233
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,500
>> DAMN.

234
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:32,256
>> Jeff: LAUREN POPS UP FOR
AIR, SLOWING DOWN A LITTLE MORE.

235
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,012
AURORA IS WHIPPING THROUGH THIS
CHALLENGE.

236
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,763
AURORA BACK IN THE WATER.

237
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,348
>> AMAZING TOSS.

238
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,601
>> Jeff: THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT
ON "SURVIVOR," RIGHT THERE.

239
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,561
>> GOOD JOB, LAUREN.

240
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,688
>> Jeff: LAUREN IS UNTYING HER
RING.

241
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,731
>> GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB.

242
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,940
>> Jeff: THERE GOES LAUREN.

243
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,942
>> GOOD JOB.

244
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,903
>> Jeff: TRYING TO GET AURORA
BACK ON THE PLATFORM.

245
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,738
YOU'RE GOOD, YELLOW.

246
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,615
GET IN THE WATER.

247
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,577
NOW YOU GOT TO LAND THOSE RINGS,
ONE ON EACH POST.

248
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,204
YELLOW WITH A BIG LEAD.

249
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,580
LAUREN IS BACK FOR BLUE.

250
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:05,039
YOU'RE GOOD.

251
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:13,798
GET IN THE WATER.

252
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,091
GAVIN CONNECTS FOR YELLOW.

253
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,092
YELLOW HAS ONE.

254
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,469
DEVENS JUST MISSES WITH HIS
SECOND.

255
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,720
DEVENS TRYING THE KEEP IT CLOSE.

256
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,097
DEVENS CONNECTS.

257
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,932
IT IS 1-1.

258
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,809
>> GOOD JOB.

259
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,311
>> Jeff: AND JUST LIKE THAT IT
IS BLUE IN THE LEAD.

260
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,939
GAVIN NOW IS THE ONE THAT'S GOT
TO PICK IT UP.

261
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,981
GAVIN HITS.

262
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,442
ON AND OFF.

263
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,112
DEVENS COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

264
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,947
JUST SHORT.

265
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,615
GAVIN TRYING THE TIE IT UP.

266
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:39,949
NO.

267
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,825
>> DANG.

268
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:46,914
>> Jeff: DEVENS ONE MORE TIME
FOR THE WIN.

269
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,792
DEVENS DOES IT!

270
00:11:49,875 --> 00:12:01,011
JULIE, LAUREN, WARDOG, AND
DEVENS WIN REWARD.

271
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,930
ALL RIGHT.

272
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:07,143
DEVENS, WARDOG, JULIE, LAUREN,
NICE AFTERNOON AWAITS.

273
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:12,148
BRING IT IN.

274
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,858
YOUR CHARIOT AWAITS.

275
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:19,488
HOP ON.

276
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,532
>> OH, MY GOD.

277
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,827
>> Jeff: AURORA, GAVIN, RON,
VICTORIA, I GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

278
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,874
SWIM OUT.

279
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,960
>> SO WE LOST THE REWARD
CHALLENGE, BUT NOW THIS IS AN

280
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,045
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO BUILD A
STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH

281
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,882
VICTORIA, RON, AND AURORA.

282
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,967
I FEEL LIKE WARDOG HAS IT OUT
FOR ME, BUT I WANT A LITTLE

283
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,053
SWEET REVENGE, AND I WANT HIS
HEAD ON A SILVER PLATTER.

284
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,034
>> HONESTLY, I HAVE NOT HAD ONE
FUN DAY HERE.

285
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,705
THAT'S WHY I'M SO MAD.

286
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,539
>> THIS GAME IS SO HARD.

287
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,041
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST GOING TO
CRY.

288
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,000
>> SORRY.

289
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,045
>> I'LL TRY NOT TO BE A HOT MESS
AROUND CAMP.

290
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,379
LY REMOVE MYSELF.

291
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,174
>> YOU'RE OKAY.

292
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,550
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

293
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,885
I KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH IT.

294
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,053
I KNOW.

295
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,764
>> GETTING VOTED OUT WITH AN
IDOL IN MY POCKET, KNOWING I

296
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,726
MADE A MISTAKE, KNOWING I'M A
PERFECTIONIST, I FEEL MAD AT

297
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,687
MYSELF BECAUSE I DIDN'T TRUST MY
GUT AND I SHOULD HAVE.

298
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,732
>> YOU ALL FEEL BETTER?

299
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,066
GIVE HER A HUG.

300
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,317
GROUP HUG.

301
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,196
>> USUALLY WHEN YOU LEAVE THE
GAME AND HEAD SOMEWHERE AND MASK

302
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,074
ALL THESE FEELINGS, BUT YOU COME
TO THE EDGE STILL DEALING WITH

303
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,242
IT.

304
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,120
AND I KNOW THAT I WILL BEAT
MYSELF UP OVER THIS FOR A LONG

305
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,123
TIME.

306
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:59,588
YESTERDAY AT CAMP WE WERE HAVING
CONVERSATIONS AND I WAS LIKE,

307
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,381
DON'T BE PARANOID.

308
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,384
YOU HAVE TO LAUGH AT IT ALL.

309
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:03,801
IT'S A GAME.

310
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,594
>> IT'S SO HARD.

311
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,097
>> FINALLY KELLEY GETS VOTED
OUT.

312
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,348
LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
TOOK THEM SO LONG.

313
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,936
I WAS TRYING TO DO THAT ON DAY
THREE WHICH ENDED UP GETTING ME

314
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,311
VOTED OUT.

315
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,481
I MEAN, BRAVO.

316
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:17,982
FINALLY.

317
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,150
KAMA IS SO STUPID.

318
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,527
I'M HAPPY THAT WENT DOWN.

319
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,987
SHE SAID, HUH, LIARS.

320
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,947
I WAS LIKE, LISTEN, DUDE, KARMA.

321
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,990
KARMA'S A BITCH.

322
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,492
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

323
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:34,081
KELLEY, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO
YOU, I'M MAD.

324
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,125
I'M SURE YOU PICKED UP ON THAT.

325
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,086
I FEEL LIKE MY "SURVIVOR"
EXPERIENCE WASN'T BECAUSE OF

326
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:39,712
YOU.

327
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,298
>> WELL, I APOLOGIZE, REEM.

328
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
I REALLY DON'T.

329
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,760
>> BUT DON'T ACT LIKE PEOPLE
DON'T COME HERE AND HAVE

330
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,596
DIARRHEA OF THE MOUTH ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

331
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,139
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU KNOW WHAT I

332
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,223
MEAN?

333
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,976
KELLEY WAS PART OF GETTING RID
OF ME, KIND OF KILLED MY

334
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,144
"SURVIVOR" DREAM, PER SE.

335
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,521
SO THAT SUCKS.

336
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,273
IT SUCKS AS A SUPER FAN.

337
00:14:59,356 --> 00:14:59,857
IT SUCKS.

338
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,983
SO I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

339
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,901
I REALLY DID.

340
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,155
BECAUSE EVERYONE HERE AT EDGE OF
EXTINCTION IS MAD AT SOMEBODY,

341
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,034
AND IF YOU DON'T LET IT OFF YOUR
CHEST, IT IS JUST GOING TO GET

342
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,162
UGLY, AND IT'S GOING TO FESTER,
SO GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.

343
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,041
EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE'S A
HEALING PROCESS ONCE YOU'RE

344
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:23,672
HERE, BUT IT TAKES TIME.

345
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,844
>> I CAME IN THIS TIME WITH THE
IDEA I WOULD HAVE TO BE MORE

346
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,138
OPEN AND VULNERABLE AND CONNECT
WITH PEOPLE, SO GETTING VOTED

347
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:37,186
OUT AND COMING TO THE EDGE DOES
MAKE ME LIKE FACE MY DEMONS IN A

348
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,978
WAY.

349
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,814
LIKE I REALIZE I'M SO
COMPETITIVE.

350
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:45,527
AND I THINK I'M A VERY TOUGH
COOKIE, TOUGH EXTERIOR, AND I'M

351
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,573
NOT SUPER VULNERABLE, AND SO I
JUST HOPE THAT THIS EXPERIENCE

352
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,242
TRANSLATES INTO REAL LIFE AND
HELPS ME GROW AS A PERSON.

353
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,204
BECAUSE WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS
WHAT'S BACK HOME.

354
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,832
LIKE I HAVE A HUSBAND WHO HAS
ALLOWED ME TO DO THIS THREE

355
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,042
TIMES.

356
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,168
I HAVE FAMILY WHO IS PROBABLY
GOING TO LAUGH AT THE FACT THEY

357
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,047
WAS AN IDIOT AND WENT HOME WITH
AN IDOL IN MY POCKET.

358
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,175
SO EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT EASY.

359
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,176
>> YOU'VE BEEN OUT HERE A WHILE.

360
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,721
I THINK YOU MAY WANT TO GET OUT
OF THE SUN.

361
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,684
>> HOPEFULLY ONCE THIS CHAPTER
IS CLOSED ON THE EDGE OF

362
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,103
EXTINCTION, I WILL LOOK BACK AND
SAY, I MADE MY MISTAKES, I'M AT

363
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:29,196
PEACE WITH IT, AND IT WAS ALSO A
GREAT EXPERIENCE IN ITS OWN WAY.

364
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:40,749
PEACE WITH IT, AND IT WAS ALSO A
GREAT EXPERIENCE IN ITS OWN WAY.

365
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,628
>> WE COME BACK THE CAMP AFTER
LOSING THE REWARD, AND IT'S

366
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,421
DISAPPOINTING.

367
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,297
I HAVEN'T EATEN REALLY IN 11
DAYS.

368
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,050
BUT LOSING TODAY IS A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY.

369
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,096
>> SO I'M THINKING WHAT IF WE
STOKE SOME COCONUT AND COFFEE.

370
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,099
>> COCONUT AND COFFEE?

371
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,268
BECAUSE I KNOW THIS AFTERNOON
I'LL HAVE TIME WITH VICTORIA,

372
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,519
AURORA, AND GAVIN.

373
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,314
SO HOPEFULLY IT BUYS ME A LITTLE
TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST

374
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,315
FOR ME.

375
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,403
>> LET'S HAVE A DAY IN PARADISE,
HOW ABOUT THAT?

376
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,904
>> THAT WAS FUN, THE CHALLENGE.

377
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,574
>> DEVENS IS VERY ATHLETIC.

378
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:19,121
HE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE LEAST
TYPICAL, BUT HE'S A BEAST.

379
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,249
>> I THINK ALL DEVENS DID AGAIN
TODAY IS PROVE HOW MUCH HE HAS

380
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,709
TO GO.

381
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,626
>> YEP.

382
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,253
>> DEVENS IS DEFINITELY THE MOST
DANGEROUS.

383
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,339
>> I THINK WE CAN ALL VOTE
DEVENS.

384
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,300
>> I'M LETTING YOU KNOW WHAT I
NEED TO DO.

385
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,679
I'M AN EASY VOTE FOR YOU.

386
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:40,684
>> THE GROUP WAS LEANING TOWARD
TAKING RICK DEVENS, WHO IS A

387
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:45,063
FAVORITE FROM THE JURY'S POINT
OF VIEW.

388
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,149
I'D RATHER FAKE OUT WARDOG
BECAUSE HE BETRAYED ME,

389
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,526
UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO BE
ADAPTABLE.

390
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,446
I HAVE TO GO WITH THE NUMBERS AT
THIS POINT BECAUSE I HAVE NO

391
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,699
TRACTION, BUT I THINK EVENTUALLY
WARDOG IS GOING TO CRUMBLE, AND

392
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,492
I'LL STILL BE HERE.

393
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,328
>> WE ALL PUT OUR VOTES ON
DEVENS.

394
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,705
>> I TRULY THINK IT'S IF BEST
MOVE.

395
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,042
>> YEP.

396
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,337
>> BEFORE TRIBAL COUNCIL AURORA
GAVE ME HER EXTRA VOTE.

397
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,339
FOR A MOMENT I'M THINKING MAYBE
I COULD KEEP THE VOTE FOR

398
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,009
MYSELF, BUT THEN I'M THINKING,
I'D RATHER GIVE IT BACK TO HER

399
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:18,013
BECAUSE THAT'S A BETTER MOVE FOR
ME.

400
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,224
I'M TRYING TO GET AURORA TO
TRUST ME COMPLETELY, AND I THINK

401
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:24,686
IF SHE FEELS, THAT SHE WILL DO
WHATEVER I NEED HER TO DO.

402
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,314
OR IF I CHOOSE, I CAN VOTE HER
OUT.

403
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:32,361
SHE WON'T SEE IT COMING.

404
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,323
>> THE TIDE IS REALLY LOW, SO
I'M GOING TO BRING BASKET DOWN

405
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,908
AND SEE IF I CAN FIND SOME
SNAILS.

406
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,369
>> I'M GOING TO KEEP EATING
UNTIL YOU COME BACK.

407
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,703
AND I HIGH STILL KEEP EATING.

408
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,081
>> I'M GOING TO COOK A LOT OF
RICE.

409
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,874
>> DO ONE CUP.

410
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,502
RON, WE'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING ON
THIS.

411
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,673
WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH LEFT.

412
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,218
>> NO, ONE CUP FOR FOUR IS GOING
TO BE PERFECTLY FINE.

413
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,387
>> AURORA, YOU'RE NOT THE RICE
NAZI.

414
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,724
>> I'D RATHER --
>> RON IS THE QUICKEST TO GET

415
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,893
SNAPPY WHEN HE DOESN'T GET HIS
WAY.

416
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:14,111
AT THIS POINT WE ARE LITERALLY
DATING EACH OTHER WHEN ALL WE

417
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,737
WANT TO DO IS BREAK UP.

418
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:20,033
IT IS THE DRAMA QUEEN IN RON
THAT COMES OUTS, BUT I'M USED TO

419
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,493
BEING AROUND DRAMA QUEENS
BECAUSE I AM ONE.

420
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,289
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN WITH
ME.

421
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,417
>> TOMORROW WE MOVE TO THREE
SCOOPS A DAY.

422
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,711
>> AURORA GETS ON MY NERVES SO
BAD.

423
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:34,715
SHE WANTS TO HAVE CONTROL OF
EVERY SITUATION EVERY MOMENT.

424
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,259
I HAVE MADE IT A MONTH WITH
AURORA.

425
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,888
IF I HAVE TO GO TO 39 DAYS WITH
HER, I NEED TO GET $2 MILLION,

426
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,055
NOT $1 MILLION.

427
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,432
>> IS THE TIDE STILL LOW?

428
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,642
>> WANT TO GO LOOK AT IT REAL
QUICK?

429
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:55,110
>> YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY.

430
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,278
>> IT FEELS GOOD.

431
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,654
>> THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

432
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,447
>> OH, WOW.

433
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,115
>> VERY NICE.

434
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,283
>> TODAY IS A GREAT DAY.

435
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,201
WE WON THE CHALLENGE.

436
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,077
I GOT CHANCE TO GET MY BODY
RIGHT.

437
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,412
I CAN FEEL RELAXED.

438
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,623
I HAVE SOME TIME AWAY FROM CAMP.

439
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,624
I'LL RECHARGE, RIGHT?

440
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,584
I GOT 11 MORE DAYS IN THIS GAME.

441
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,879
I KNOW THE END IS NEAR, AND THIS
WILL BE THE BOOST I NEED.

442
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,631
>> WANT ME TO GET YOUR BACK?

443
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,134
TESTIFY COME ON, YOU DO MY
BECOME AN I'LL DO YOURINGS.

444
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:19,968
OH YEAH,.

445
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,512
>> OH,
>> NOTHING BETTER THAN HAVING

446
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,430
DEVENS RUB MUD ON ME.

447
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,850
>> I HAVE DREAMED OF THIS SINCE
DAY ONE.

448
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,976
FINALLY, DAY 28.

449
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,397
WARDOG AND I HAVE, WHO HAVE HAD
SUCH AN UP-AND-DOWN GAME

450
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,649
STRATEGICALLY, ARE RUBBING THE
MUD ON EACH OTHER.

451
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,943
>> OH, LOOK AT THAT.

452
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,153
AND WE COVER EACH OTHER HEAD TO
TOE.

453
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:38,904
WE'RE HAVING FUN.

454
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,906
THE GIRLS ARE DOING THE SAME
THING.

455
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,658
THIS IS A BONDING EXPERIENCE.

456
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,286
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY CLOSE
AFTER THIS.

457
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,496
>> YOU WANT THE TALK ON HEAVEN.

458
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:53,335
HEAVEN IS GETTING MUD RUBBED ON
YOU BY WARDOG IN FIJI.

459
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,337
>> OH, YEAH.

460
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,673
>> IT'S LIKE A HOT TUB.

461
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,549
>> THIS FEELS AMAZING.

462
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,093
>> I LOVE HOT WATER.

463
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,388
>> GOING INTO THIS REWARD, THE
WAY THE TEAMS WORKED OUT, I'M

464
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,849
NOT LOOKING AT IT AS A STRATEGIC
OPPORTUNITY, BECAUSE LAUREN AND

465
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,518
JULIE ARE NOT PLAYING THE GAME.

466
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,478
THEY'RE JUST GOING WHERE THE
WIND BLOWS.

467
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,481
THEY'RE NOT IN THE DRIVER'S
SEAT, AND THEY SEEM OKAY WITH&4P

468
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,235
SO IT'S JUST A REALLY COOL HUMAN
OPPORTUNITY TO BOND WITH

469
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,862
EVERYBODY IN A WAY TO STEP AWAY
FROM THE GAME FOR A LITTLE

470
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,571
WHILE.

471
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,407
>> OH, MAN.

472
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,199
YEAH.

473
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:24,616
THAT WILL WAKE YOU UP IN THE
MORNING.

474
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,492
>> HOW IS IT?

475
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,661
>> IT'S NICE.

476
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,328
IT'S A LITTLE COLD.

477
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,371
>> OKAY.

478
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,041
JUST GET CLEAN.

479
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,544
WE'VE HEARD EVERY GIRL'S NAME
MENTIONED AS SOMEBODY WHO WOULD

480
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:41,049
BE BEATABLE IN THE END, LIKE A
GIRL TO TAKE TO THE END SOME

481
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,050
HERE'S THE DEAL.

482
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,510
I'M TRYING THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO
SHAPE THINGS UP.

483
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,137
I HAVE AN IDEA.

484
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,637
>> OKAY.

485
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,807
>> WE TAKE OUT RICK.

486
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,518
>> I THINK WARDOG IS WORSE THAN
RICK.

487
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,729
I COULD SEE HIM WINNING THE
GAME.

488
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,398
>> I THINK AS LONG AS WARDOG IS
IN THE GAME, WE HAVE SOMEONE

489
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,232
THAT EVERYONE CAN AGREE.

490
00:21:57,315 --> 00:22:03,238
>> I'M TELLING YOU --
>> I TRUST YOU.

491
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:03,739
>> I TRUST YOU.

492
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,906
LY NOT TURN ON YOU.

493
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,452
>> JULIE IS TALKING ABOUT HOW
SHE WANTS WARDOG GONE, BUT I

494
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,537
DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE SMARTEST
MOVE.

495
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,538
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

496
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,749
>> GOOD JOB TODAY.

497
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,878
>> I THINK DEVENS IS MUCH MORE
DANGEROUS THAN ANYONE ELSE ON

498
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:18,920
THIS BEACH.

499
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,300
SO NOW I HAVE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE
TO TAKE RICK OUT.

500
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:50,619
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

501
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,453
ALL RIGHT.

502
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,121
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

503
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,290
FIRST THINGS FIRST, DEVENS.

504
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,124
TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

505
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:01,463
>> ALL RIGHT.

506
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,508
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

507
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,512
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE WE'LL RACE
OVER AN OBSTACLE CARRYING A

508
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,638
BUOY.

509
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,516
YOU'LL THEN MANEUVER A SECOND
BUOY THREW A LONG TUNNEL.

510
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,476
FINALLY YOU'LL GAB YOUR THIRD
BUOY AND FALL UNDER A NET.

511
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,146
YOU'LL THEN USE THE KEYS

THIS FIRST OBSTACLE YOU CANNOT

523
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,976
YOU HAVE TO JUMP FROM ONE TO
ANOTHER.

524
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,018
EVERYBODY LOOKING GOOD.

525
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,061

527
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:05,485
GAVIN IS THERE.

528
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:05,777
DEVENS.

529
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,486
LAUREN.

530
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:06,987
VICTORIA.

531
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,362
WARDOG IS THROUGH.

532
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,738
JULIE IS OVER.

533
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,909
NOW YOU'RE MANEUVERING A SECOND
BUOY.

534
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,662
RON WORKING ON THAT AND HE'S GOT
IT.

535
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:22,711
RON'S GOOD NOW.

536
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,753
AURORA QUICKLY THROUGH.

537
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,714
GAVIN ON HER TAIL.

538
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,758
JULIE IS IN IT.

539
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,385
DEVENS HAS HIS.

540
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,720
HE'S THROUGH.

541
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,347
AURORA WORKING ON THAT THIRD
BUOY.

542
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,558
SHE'S GOT IT.

543
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,142
THERE GOES GAVIN.

544
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:43,565
DEVENS RIGHT ON HIS TAIL.

545
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,735
DEVENS IS WHIPPING THROUGH THIS
THIRD PART OF THE CHALLENGE.

546
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:51,281
IT'S NOW AURORA AND DEVENS THAT
ARE COMING OUT AT EXACTLY THE

547
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,532
SAME MOMENT.

548
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,744
NOW YOU GOT TO USE ONE OF THOSE
THREE KEYS TO UNLOCK THE LOCK,

549
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,079
HOLDING YOUR PUZZLE.

550
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,331
GAVIN IS THROUGH.

551
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,332
WARDOG PUSHING.

552
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,626
HERE COMES VICTORIA.

553
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,461
LAUREN TRYING TO GET THROUGH
THIS.

554
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,296
JULIE IS IN IT.

555
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,965
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT LOCK OPEN,
GET RID OF IT AND START WORKING

556
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,592
ON THE PUZZLING.

557
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,137
LAUREN IS THROUGH.

558
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,931
HERE COMES JULIE AND RON.

559
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:16,932
EVERYBODY NOW WITH THEIR PUZZLE.

THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT ON DAY 29.

561
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,270
EVERYBODY WITH A SHOT.

562
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,772
EIGHT PEOPLE LEFT IN THIS GAME.

563
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:29,778
YOU WANT THE MAKE IT TO SEVEN
AND DAY 30, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.

564
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,280
YOU ARE BUILDING A STAR PUZZLE.

565
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,449
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR SOME
CLUE.

566
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,076
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS PUZZLE?

567
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,327
IS THERE A PATTERN?

568
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:42,123
IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN FIGURE
OUT THAT WILL HELP ME SOLVE IT?

569
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:46,461
>> I HATE PUZZLES.

570
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,796
>> Jeff: DEVENS MAKING A
LITTLE PROGRESS.

571
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,841
GAVIN'S GOT SOME PROGRESS.

572
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,927
AURORA IS MOVING QUICKLY.

573
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,511
SHE'S RIGHT.

574
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,806
SHE'S GOT SOMETHING GOING.

575
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,392
GAVIN AND DEVENS HAVE A FEW
PIECES IN PLACE.

576
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,395
THE QUESTION IS, ARE THEY IN THE
RIGHT PLACE?

577
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,481
RON NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING YET.

578
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,149
JULIE NOTHING.

579
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,110
VICTORIA NOTHING.

580
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,319
LAUREN NOT MUCH.

581
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,990
WARDOG HAS A FEW PIECES IN
PLACE.

582
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,201
IT'S AURORA NOW WITH SOMETHING.

583
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,160
>> COME ON.

584
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,205
>> Jeff: DEVENS CONTINUES,
PIECE BY PIECE.

585
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,625
HE'S GOT SOMETHING GOING AND HE
KNOWS IT.

586
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,670
CAN ANYBODY CATCH HIM NOW IS THE
QUESTION?

587
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,799
IT IS AURORA AND DEVENS RIGHT
NOW IN THE LEAD.

588
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:42,934
NOBODY ELSE REALLY CLOSE.

589
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,894
DEVENS HAS HIT A ROADBLOCK NOW.

590
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:59,409
THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR AURORA.

591
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,744
AURORA WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

592
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,369
DEVENS WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

593
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,746
GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER.

594
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,747
>> I GOT IT.

595
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,706
I GOT IT.

596
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,875
>> Jeff: DEVENS HAS IT.

597
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,917
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY FOR DEVENS.

598
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,254
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

599
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,380
WOW.

600
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:25,685
THE PIECES STARTED GOING
TOGETHER FAST.

601
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,855
DEVENS, COME ON OVER.

602
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:34,027
SECOND TIME IN A ROW INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

603
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,195
COUNCIL.

604
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,197
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, TONIGHT
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE 12th

605
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,907
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

606
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,241
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

607
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:40,867
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

608
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,951
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

609
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,203
CONGRATS.

610
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,412
>> BEFORE THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
WE HAD THIS PLAN TO GET DEVENS

611
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,583
OUT, BUT AS SOON AS RICK WINS,
IT JUST SNAPS IN MY HEAD, IT'S

612
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,584
GOT TO BE WARDOG.

613
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,919
PEOPLE KNOW THE GAME WARDOG IS
PLAYING.

614
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,547
IF HE GETS TO THE END, HE WILL
WIN THIS GAME.

615
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,218
HOPEFULLY PEOPLE OPEN THEIR EYES
AND SEE WE HAVE THE GET WARDOG

616
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,386
OUT RIGHT NOW.

617
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,720
SAYONARA, WARDOG.

618
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,806
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM GO.

619
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,128
>> I WAS SO MAD WHEN RICK CON
IMMUNITY TODAY.

620
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,629
I REALLY WANTED HIM OUT OF HERE.

621
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,797
HE'S SUCH A THREAT.

622
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,800
THE MORE HE STICKS AROUND, I
THINK THE MORE DANGEROUS HE

623
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,801
BECOMES.

624
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,802
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

625
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,012
>> THANKS, GUYS.

626
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:43,972
>> YOU SAID YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT
PUZZLES.

627
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,223
>> I DIDN'T THINK I WAS.

628
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:53,148
>> OUR PLAN WAS GOING TO BE THAT
RICK GOES HOME, BUT RICK IS SAFE

629
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,983
>> WARDOG AND RICK ARE THE TWO
BIG THREATS OF GAME.

630
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:59,070
ONE OF THE THREATS WON IMMUNITY,
SO MAYBE YOU VOTE THE OTHER ONE

631
00:28:59,154 --> 00:28:59,696
OUT.

632
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,283
IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

633
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,993
>> I WAS FREAKING OUT THIS
MORNING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE

634
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:05,743
ME.

635
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,121
>> WANT TO GO TO THE FIRE WITH
ME.

636
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:08,496
>> I WOULD LOVE THAT.

637
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,915
>> LET'S GO.

638
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,877
>> SO DEVENS WON IMMUNITY.

639
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,005
>> WHAT ABOUT WARDOG?

640
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,173
>> DON'T FORGET.

641
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,177
>> WARDOG SAYS THAT IF ALL THE
THREATS IN THE GAME ARE GONE,

642
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,012
THE NEXT LARGEST THREAT WOULD
GO.

643
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,182
IF WE TAKE OUT WARDOG, THAT
LEAVES ME IN THE HOT SEAT,

644
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,683
BECAUSE I'M THE NEXT BIGGEST
THREAT.

645
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,644
>> NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS, HE'S
GOING HOME.

646
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,687
>> HERE HE COMES.

647
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,522
>> I HAVE A TOUGH DECISION TO
MAKE.

648
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,485
DO I SEND HOME WARDOG WITH MY
VOTE AND ALIGN WITH AURORA,

649
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:42,030
VICTORIA, OR GAVIN, OR IF I
CHOOSE, I CAN FLIP MY VOTE AND

650
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,366
WORK WITH DEVENS AND WARDOG TO
VOTE FOR AURORA AND SHE WOULD GO

651
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:45,867
HOME.

652
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,576
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

653
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,870
>> RON, YOU WANT ANOTHER
COCONUT?

654
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,038
>> THANK YOU.

655
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,374
>> WITH RICK WINNING IMMUNITY,
I'M THE BIGGEST THREAT YOU CAN

656
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,584
VOTE OUT RIGHT NOW.

657
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,880
IF VICTORIA, GAVIN, JULIE, AND
AURORA TEAM UP, THEY CAN TAKE ME

658
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,089
OUT.

659
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,010
SO MY STRATEGY IS TO TARGET
AURORA, BECAUSE THERE'S IN LOVE

660
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,345
LOST TAKING OUT AURORA.

661
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,723
SHE RUNS A BIG MOUTH, AND SHE'S
ON THE BOTTOM.

662
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:11,351
>> NOT GOOD FOR HIM TO WIN
IMMUNITY FOR US.

663
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,268
>> IT'S NOT.

664
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,438
IF WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER.

665
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,899
I'M OUT AND YOU'RE OUT AND
NEITHER ONE OF US GET.

666
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,692
THERE WE GO WITH AURORA NOW.

667
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,026
LET'S DO IT.

668
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:20,735
>> SOLID.

669
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:21,319
>> OKAY.

670
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,028
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

671
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,112
>> TAKE OUT AURORA.

672
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,073
>> TAKE OUT AURORA?

673
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,032
>> YES.

674
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,117
>> WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THIS WHEN
I SAID THIS?

675
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,744
>> WE CAN DO IT NOW.

676
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:30,912
I TALKED WITH RON.

677
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,956
>> I MEAN, WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE
YOU AFTER THE LAST VOTE?

678
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,126
>> WELL, THE LAST VOTE, YOU WERE
CLOSER TO KELLEY THAN I WAS.

679
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,545
YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD KELLEY.

680
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,754
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

681
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:40,380
THAT MAKES SENSE, RIGHT?

682
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,423
>> SO TAKE OUT AURORA?

683
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,591
>> YEAH.

684
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:48,054
IF PEOPLE ARE PLAYING SMART,
THEY GO AFTER WARDOG, BUT I'M

685
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,431
BANKING ON STUPIDITY TONIGHT.

686
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,101
>> I THINK MY DAD IS GOING TO BE
SO IMPRESSED WITH MY FIRE

687
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,143
SKILLS.

688
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,939
I DON'T TRUST WARDOG, BUT MAYBE
HIS PLAN WILL WORK.

689
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,984
IT MAKES SENSE FOR MY GAME.

690
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,946
I HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR AURORA
TO GET VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME

691
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,905
FOREVER.

692
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,741
MAYBE I COULD HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH LAUREN.

693
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:13,246
>> WARDOG TOLD ME I WAS RIGHT
ALL ALONG, AURORA SHOULD GO

694
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:18,167
HOME, AND YOU AND ME AND RICK
AND RON TAKE OUT AURORA.

695
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:23,131
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE SHOULDN'T
TAKE WARDOG OUT FIRST.

696
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,175
>> AT LEAST I MOW THE DEVIL
WE'RE WORKING WITH WHEN WE'RE

697
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,093
WORKING WITH WARDOG.

698
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,261
>> RIGHT.

699
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,973
>> I THINK WE STILL TAKE OUT
AURORA, THEN WE ARE LEFT WITH

700
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,976
THE TWO OF US AND WARDOG.

701
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,144
>> I DON'T KNOW.

702
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,062
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

703
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,981
>> OH, MY GOD.

704
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,190
THE GROUP WANTS THE TAKE OUT
WARDOG.

705
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:45,778
I WOULD LOVE REVENGE FOR KELLEY,
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE

706
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:50,283
BEST THING FOR ME AND MY GAME.

707
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:55,538
I'M TRYING NOT TO BE EMOTIONAL
ABOUT IT, BUT I'M REALLY

708
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,748
NERVOUS.

709
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,499
IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT NOW,
IF I DON'T LOOK TO THE FUTURE,

710
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:03,338
IF I DON'T SET UP MY ALLIANCE,
IF I DON'T GET MY DUCKS IN A

711
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,467
ROW, THEN I WON'T HAVE A FUTURE.

712
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,011
>> I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A
LOT OF PEOPLE PULLING YOU ASIDE

713
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,928
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

714
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,057
>> IT WAS WARDOG TALKING AND ME
LISTENING.

715
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,059
I'M TIRED OF WONDERING WHO I CAN
REALLY TRUST.

716
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,185
>> YOU CAN TRUST ME.

717
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:22,565
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE I TRIED TO
SHOW YOU THE TRUST.

718
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,525
THE BIGGEST THING I HAD, BY
GIVING YOU THAT.

719
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,693
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO HAND IT BACK.

720
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,403
>> I DON'T EVEN QUESTION YOUR
TRUST.

721
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,990
>> WE ARE ALL THREATS IN THIS
GAME.

722
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,494
THERE'S DEFINITELY CONCERN THAT
RON COULD BE WORKING WITH WARDOG

723
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,620
AND RICK.

724
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:40,166
RON IS THE ONE THAT IS PLAYING
BOTH SIDES, AND HE'S DONE

725
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,043
NOTHING BUT LIE TO ME IN THIS
GAME.

726
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,214
MY ADVANTAGE IS AN EXTRA VOTE.

727
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,885
AND THAT DEFINITELY COULD COME
IN HANDY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

728
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:54,389
WARDOG AND RICK ARE NOT TALKING
TO ME.

729
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,016
THE ONLY OTHER TIME THIS
HAPPENED IS WHEN MY NAME IS

730
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,850
BEING WRITTEN DOWN.

731
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,686
AND THAT NEVER FEELS GOOD.

732
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,563
AND YOU WOULD BE CRAZY TO SAY
THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE,

733
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,692
BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU'RE GOING
HOME.

734
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:27,046
♪

735
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:34,011
♪

736
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:53,948
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

737
00:33:54,031 --> 00:34:01,122
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

738
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,292
SO, WARDOG, WHAT IS THE
TEMPERATURE BECOME AT CAMP?

739
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,251
IS IT FRIENDLY?

740
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,128
HAS IT SHIFTED?

741
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,588
DO YOU SENSE PARANOIA?

742
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,299
>> YEAH, AS NUMBERS GET DOWN,
THERE'S LESS PEOPLE YOU CAN

743
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,468
POINT A FINGER AT.

744
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,636
SINCE EVERYBODY TALKS TO
EVERYBODY, IT GETS REALLY THICK

745
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,804
IN THE WEEDS OUT THERE.

746
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,724
SO I DIDN'T REALIZE IT, BUT AS
IT GETS SMALLER, THE GAME GETS

747
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,976
MUCH HARDER, EVEN THOUGH THERE
ARE LESS PIECES TO MOVE AROUND.

748
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,312
>> GAVING, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD
A REACTION.

749
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,274
>> YEAH, WARDOG IS SAYING
EVERYONE IS TALKING TO EVERYONE,

750
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:33,321
BUT WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN SINCE THE
WENTWORTH VOTE.

751
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,323
>> AFTER THE COMMENT HE MADE A
COMMENT THAT I DIDN'T LIKE TOO

752
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,491
MUCH.

753
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,951
HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY, OH,
IF I HAD KNOWN YOU HAD THE

754
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,203
NUMBERS, I WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALONG.

755
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,204
IF I HAD KNOWN.

756
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,791
>> THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS
TO APPROACH IT.

757
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,878
THERE'S TALKING TO SOMEONE, BUT
I FEEL LIKE WARDOG WAS TALKING

758
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:49,921
AT ME.

759
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,506
I THINK THAT'S THE REASON WE
HAVEN'T SPOKEN SINCE.

760
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,341
>> GO, GAVIN.

761
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,176
>> Jeff: DEVENS, YOU COULD
MAKE A CASE THAT EVERY TRIBAL

762
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,346
CAN BE A TURNING POINT IN THAT
THERE IS NO WAY TO STOP THAT

763
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,099
BALL THAT'S ROLLING DOWN THE
HILL, WHICH IS GREAT IF YOU'RE

764
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,268
THE ONE PUSHING, NOT SO GOOD IF
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S ABOUT TO

765
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:04,685
ROLL OVER.

766
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,687
>> ABSOLUTELY.

767
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,690
THE LAST RETURNING PLAYER WAS
VOTED OUT LAST TRIBAL.

768
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,527
THE LAST SEVERAL PLAYERS HAVE
BEEN REALLY BIG TARGETS.

769
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,905
YOU DO LOOK AROUND AND GO, WHICH
SIDE OF THE BALL AM I ON?

770
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,200
AM I CALL UP IN THIS, OR AM I
PUSHING?

771
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,993
EVERY STEP IS PRECARIOUS RIGHT
NOW.

772
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,539
>> Jeff: WARDOG, DO YOU AGREE
IT'S BEEN A LOT OF BIG TARGETS

773
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,289
THAT ARE NOW ON THE JURY?

774
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,415
>> ABSOLUTELY.

775
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,376
SINCE THE MERGE EVERYONE IS A
BIG TARGET.

776
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,378
>> Jeff: DOES THAT CONCERN
YOU?

777
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,504
>> ABSOLUTELY.

778
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,048
I FEEL LIKE MY TARGET HAS GROWN
A LOT.

779
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,425
FIRST I'VE HAD TO BATTLE FOR 13
DAYS WITH DAVID.

780
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,680
AND THEN WENTWORTH, I FELT LIKE
SHE WAS PREPARING AN END GAME

781
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,265
THAT DIDN'T INCLUDE ME, SO
MYSELF AND RON PUT HER OUT OF

782
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,850
THE GAME.

783
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,768
SO I GOT A BIG TARGET.

784
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:50,273
>> Jeff: WOW, RON, VERY CLEVER
MOVE LIKE WARDOG JUST PUT YOU IN

785
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,399
THAT CAGE RIGHT WITH HIM.

786
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,067
>> TRUTHFUL.

787
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,318
I WAS PARTED OF IT.

788
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,780
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE
WHO THE THREATS ARE AND DECIDE

789
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,241
WHEN TO MAKE THE MOVE TO REMOVE
THEM FROM THIS GAME.

790
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,952
>> Jeff: VICTORIA, VERY
INTERESTING WHAT'S HAPPENING

791
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,203
TONIGHT, PEOPLE ARE WORKING
JURY.

792
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,081
ONE WAY YOU WORK A JURY IS BY
SAYING, I'M THE ONE THAT PLAYED

793
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:10,418
YOU, SO REMEMBER THAT WHEN I'M
IN THE END, AS THOUGH THAT IS A

794
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,086
BADGE OF HONOR, WHICH IT CAN BE.

795
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,923
>> I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON
THE KIND OF JURY YOU HAVE IF

796
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,091
THAT WORKS OR NOT.

797
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:20,386
LIKE WARDOG SAID AND RON SAID,
THE BIG TARGETS RIGHT NOW ARE

798
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:23,264
THE THREATS IN THE GAME, SO IF
YOU START BRAGGING, HEY, I GOT

799
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,308
THIS PERSON, THIS PERSON, THIS
PERSON OUT, LOOK HOW GREAT I AM,

800
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,311
YOUR TRIBE COULD FIND YOU AS A
THREAT, BUT IF YOU DON'T START

801
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,981
TALKING ABOUT IT SOON, THE JURY
MIGHT NOT RESPECT YOU.

802
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,275
SO GAVIN, THREE PEOPLE NOW,
WARDOG, RON, AND VICTORIA ALL

803
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:39,363
SAY, YEAH, THE FAR -- TARGETS
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE THE BIGGEST

804
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,531
THREATS.

805
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,617
>> THAT'S THE REASON EVERY ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE SITTING

806
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,201
OVER.

807
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,118
THERE THEY WERE A THREAT.

808
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,411
I THINK PEOPLE SAW THEM AS
WINNING THIS GAME.

809
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,496
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE OVER THERE
AND SOME OF US ARE STILL OVER

810
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,623
HERE.

811
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,626
>> Jeff: AURORA, IF WE DID AN
ANONYMOUS SURVEY, WOULD

812
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,962
EVERYBODY AGREE WHO THE THREATS
ARE IN THIS GROUP OF EIGHT?

813
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,005
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

814
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:59,592
I THINK EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME
IS ABOUT PERCEPTION.

815
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,011
EACH DAY IT CHANGES, AND IT'S
GOING TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

816
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:06,682
THE GAME IS NOWHERE NEAR OVER,
AND THERE IS NO ONE THREAT.

817
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,351
>> Jeff: LAUREN, HOW ABOUT FOR
YOU?

818
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,270
IS THERE A CONSENSUS AMONG THIS
EIGHT WHO THE REAL THREATS ARE?

819
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,272
>> IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU WANT TO
SIT WITH AT THE END.

820
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:17,193
WHO I PERCEIVE AS A THREAT JULIE
MIGHT NOT SEE AS A THREAT.

821
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,986
IT'S REALLY GRAY.

822
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,490
>> Jeff: DEVENS, WHAT DO YOU
DO TO MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT THE

823
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,494
PEOPLE YOU THINK ARE A THREAT,
EVEN THOUGH THAT MAY NOT LINE UP

824
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,662
WITH WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE THINKS?

825
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,331
>> THAT'S WHAT'S SO PRECARIOUS
ABOUT THE GAME.

826
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,834
EVERY OPPORTUNITY A SETBACK, AND
EVERY SETBACK IS AN OPPORTUNITY.

827
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,546
THE LAST TWO TRIBALS I FELL LIKE
I NEEDED TO WIN TO STAY SAFE,

828
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,800
BUT EVERY TIME YOU WIN, YOU
THINK, OH, NO, AM I TOO MUCH OF

829
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,926
A THREAT NOW.

830
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,179
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE ALL QUEUING
AROUND CAMP LIKE JULIE IS

831
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,181
CAESAR.

832
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:50,268
EVERYWHERE WE TURN, THERE IS A
KNIFE AND WHAT'S UP, MAN?

833
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,268
WANT TO GET SOME WATER.

834
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,021
IT'S A SCARY TIME AROUND CAMP.

835
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,564
>> Jeff: RON, YOU SORT OF
RELISH THAT IDEA THAT IT COULD

836
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,484
BE EVERYBODY HAS A KNIFE AND
EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY HAS A

837
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,151
KNIFE?

838
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,697
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT ACTUALLY.

839
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,824
THAT'S WHY I TRY TO FIND PEOPLE
WHO I CAN TRUST.

840
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:09,829
I DON'T WANT TO GET THE ET TU,
BRUTE IN MY BACK.

841
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,998
I'M LOOKING FOR TRUE
RELATIONSHIPS, TRUE PEOPLE I CAN

842
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,500
GO TO THE END WITH AND THAT
WE'RE SOLID.

843
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,502
>> Jeff: LAUREN, THE IRONY OF
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP YOU CAN

844
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:21,382
TRUST IS THAT EVERYBODY IN THAT
GROUP BELIEVES THEY'RE THE ONE

845
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,550
THAT WILL WIN.

846
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,927
>> YEAH, IF YOU TELL ME, YOU
KNOW, I WANT TO GO TO THE END

847
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,763
WITH YOU, THEN THERE IS PART OF
YOU THAT THINKS YOU CAN BEAT ME.

848
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,225
AND IF YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT
ME, WHAT AM I MISSING?

849
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:34,228
I THINK THAT'S A VERY
COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP TO

850
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,354
BALANCE.
