1
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,511
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WRESTLE OVER
THIS.

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,429
>> I AM STANDING THERE WITH THE
IDOL IN MY LITTLE PINK SHORTS,

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:18,268
AND PANDEMONIUM IS ENSUING IN
FRONT OF ME.

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,145
>> Jeff: WHILE A STRONG
ALLIANCE OF SEVEN WAS CALLING

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,273
THE SHOTS.

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,734
AND MIKE WAS DESPERATE TO JOIN
THEM.

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,571
>> THIS COULD BE MY MOMENT TO
GET OFF THE BOTTOM.

8
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,781
>> Jeff: AT TRIKE, ACCUSATIONS
WERE MADE.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,243
>> THERE'S ONE PERSON RUNNING
THE GAME RIGHT NOW, AND THAT'S

10
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,369
BEN.

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,290
>> OUR ALLIANCE, WE SIT LIKE THE
KNIGHTS OF A ROUNDTABLE.

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,292
>> Jeff: ORDERS WERE FOLLOWED.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:47,422
AND LAUREN SAVED HER VOTE FOR A
FUTURE TRIBAL COUNCIL BY USING

14
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,966
HER SECRET ADVANTAGE.

15
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,303
IN THE END, DESI BECAME THE
FIRST MEMBER OF THE JURY.

16
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,141
DESI, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,350
10 ARE LEFT.

18
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:07,317
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

19
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,878
>> MY TRIBAL COUNCIL EXPERIENCE
WAS, AGAIN, ME NOT KNOWING WHO'S

20
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,046
GOING HOME.

21
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:32,842
I VOTED FOR THE PERSON I WAS
SUPPOSED TO VOTE FOR, BUT DESI

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:37,222
WENT HOME, AND I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE

23
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,349
THEY'RE TRYING TO STAY TOGETHER
AND VOTE OFF THE HEALERS.

24
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,558
>> OH, THAT'S PRETTY.

25
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:45,063
>> SO AT THIS POINT, I NEED TO
THROW THE OTHER HEALERS UNDER

26
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,983
THE BUS, AND SUDDENLY-- NOT EVEN
SO SUDDENLY-- THROWING NAMES OUT

27
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,736
THERE, IT COULD MEAN I'M HERE
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,743
THE HEALERS FELL APART WHEN WE
HAD THE YAWA, AND COLE STARTED

29
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,038
TELLING JESSE SECRETS AND THEN
STARTED STEALING PEANUT BUTTER.

30
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,039
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

31
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,541
>> WHAT A GUY, HUH?

32
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,544
>> AT THAT POINT, THE HEALERS
WERE DONE.

33
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,713
I HAVE AN IDOL BUT I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY IT SO I'M THROWING NAMES

34
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,716
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, KNOWING
THAT JOE AND COLE ARE SO HATED

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,761
ON THIS TRIBE, THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO BE ONE OF THE TWO

36
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,388
PEOPLE TO GO NEXT.

37
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:18,805
>> GOOD MORNING, CHRISSY.

38
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,347
>> GOOD MORNING.

39
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,058
>> HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

40
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:22,517
>> I'M HAPPY EVERY DAY.

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,726
IT'S A NEW DAY.

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,397
>> I HAVE THE SECRET ADVANTAGE
AND I PLAYED IT AND I THINK I

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,439
PLAYED IT VERY WELL.

44
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,358
NOBODY CAUGHT ON TO IT.

45
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,734
I GOT AWAY WITH IT.

46
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,196
MY SECRET ADVANTAGE IS IN PLAY,
WHICH IS SUPER EXCITING FOR ME

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,864
BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TWO VOTES.

48
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:41,077
>> HOW FREAKING LUCKY ARE WE?

49
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,746
>> YOU AIN'T TOLD NOBODY I HAVE
IT, HAVE YOU?

50
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,581
>> NO.

51
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,584
>> BECAUSE I PULLED THAT OFF
REALLY GOOD.

52
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,419
I'M NOT TURNING MY BACK ON YOU.

53
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,087
I HOPE YOU DON'T, EITHER.

54
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,297
>> NO.

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,427
>> WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO SEVEN IT
WILL BE A HARD DECISION ME AND

56
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,344
YOU.

57
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,554
>> WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT WHEN WE
GET THERE.

58
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,431
>> AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW THE
ONLY PERSON WHO BEES ABOUT THE

59
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,640
SECRET ADVANTAGE IS BEN.

60
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,895
AND SO FAR, HE'S NOT LET ME
DOWN, AND I'VE NOT LET HIM DOWN,

61
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,772
AND KEEPING HIM INVOLVED IN IT
KEEPS US, TWO, TOGETHER.

62
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,400
>> IT COULDN'T HAVE WORKED OUT
ANY BETTER.

63
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,444
>> WE'RE GOOD WITH THE SIEVE?

64
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,653
>> WE'RE SOLID, FINAL SEVEN.

65
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,448
THE ONLY THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT
IS WE'RE GOING TO BE SCREWED

66
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,198
ONCE WE GET THERE.

67
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,827
>> I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE
SCREWED.

68
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,495
>> YOU DON'T THINK SO?

69
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:24,913
>> NO.

70
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,955
YOU KNOW WHY?

71
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,789
>> WHY.

72
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,084
>> BECAUSE I HAVE AN IDOL IN MY
PANTS.

73
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:30,627
>> SHUT UP!

74
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,670
>> I FOUND IT BEFORE.

75
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,673
I'M REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF SO
FAR BECAUSE I FOUND THE IDOL

76
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,424
UNDERNEATH THE FLAG.

77
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:36,883
IT'S MINE.

78
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,134
IT'S IN MY POCKET.

79
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,803
IT WILL BE IN MY PANTS GOING TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

80
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,888
>> HOW DID YOU GET IT?

81
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,641
>> CHRISSY SAW THE PLATE AND
THEN I SAW THE PLATE, TOO.

82
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,352
USUALLY IF SOMEBODY HAS AN IDOL,
YOU KEEP YOUR CARDS CLOSE TO

83
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:53,483
YOUR VEST, BUT DEVIN REALLY
TRUSTS ME, SO I HAD TO TELL MY

84
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:53,816
BOY DEVON.

85
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,777
>> NO ONE.

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,319
>> I KNOW.

87
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,528
>> THAT'S NEVER LEAKING.

88
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,824
>> I KNOW THAT DEVON WILL NEVER
TELL ANYBODY THAT I HAVE AN

89
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,283
IMMUNITY IDOL.

90
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:02,992
>> THANK YOU, MAN.

91
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,035
I APPRECIATE THAT.

92
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,957
>> I'M MAKING HIM DEPENDENT ON
ME A LITTLE BIT, AND

93
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,375
THATDEPENDENCY IS CARRYING ME
INTO THE END.

94
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,462
>> I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE BEST TEAM "SURVIVOR" HAS

95
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:14,963
EVER SEEN.

96
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,174
>> WE'RE A GOOD DUO.

97
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,468
>> AND NOBODY EVEN KNOWS.

98
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,145
Captioning funded by CBS.

99
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,545
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYSREAD
CHALLENGE.

100
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:55,878
>> YEAH!

101
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,922
>> YES.

102
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,549
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE DIVIDED

103
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,800
INTO TWO TEAMS.

104
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:06,055
ON MY "GO" YOU'LL SWIM OUT TO A
TALL LADDER, CLIMB THAT LADDER,

105
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,726
LEAP OFF THE LADDER, AND
RETRIEVE A KEY UNDERWATER.

106
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,520
ONCE YOU HAVE THREE KEYS, YOU'LL
OPEN A CHEST AND USE THE BALLS

107
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:16,899
INSIDE TO SCORE FIVE BASKETS.

108
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,068
FIRST TEAM TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.

109
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,236
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR.

110
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,407
>> Jeff: THE WINNING FIVE WILL
BE TAKEN ON TO A LUXURY YACHT.

111
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,575
>> OKAY.

112
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:31,748
>> WHY YOU WILL TOUR THE FUJIIAN
ISLANDS, DINE ON SANDWICHES,

113
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,584
COLD BEER, RED WINE, AND
CHOCOLATE CAKE.

114
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,169
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

115
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,378
WHAT'S THE CATCH, JEFF?

116
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,673
>> Jeff: THE CATCH IS, LOSERS
WILL GO BACK TO CAMP FOR MORE

117
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,090
COCONUT AND RICE.

118
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:41,758
>> ALL RIGHT.

119
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,633
>> Jeff: WORTH PLAYING FOR?

120
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,385
>> YES!

121
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,929
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'LL
DIVIDE INTO TEAMS AND GET

122
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,388
STARTED.

123
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,768
LET'S DO A DRAW.

124
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,227
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

125
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,271

KEEP IT UP.

CHRISSY GOES DOWN FIRST.

151
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:54,122
THERE GOES BEN.

00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,575
BEN LOST A LOT OF TIME IN THAT
FIRST ROUND.

169

THIS IS WHAT SHE DOES FOR A
LIVING, AND YOU CAN SEE IT.

00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:48,110
HE JUMPEDAUR THE LADDER AND HAS
STAYED UNDER WATER.

197
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,446

MIKE, JOE, JP, CHRISSY, COLE--
BIG WIN.

258
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,749
WE'RE GOING TO BRING ONE OF OUR
BOATS IN.

259
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,211
THEY WILL TAKE YOU TO A LUXURY
YACHT, WHERE YOU WILL HAVE A

00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:10,753
NICE AFTERNOON.

EXTRA ENERGY AND HAVE AN EDGE
WHEN IT COMES TO INDIVIDUAL

00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,642
CHALLENGES.

267
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,144
BUT, ACTUALLY, THIS REWARD GIVES
ME A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO

268
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,813
MAKE MOVES AND COMPLETELY CHANGE
THE GAME.

00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,982
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LAUREN,
ASHLEY, DEVON, BEN, RYAN, GOT

>> TO GET A HUGE MEAL ON A
GORGEOUS YACHT WHILE CRUISING

273
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,973
THE FIJIAN ISLANDS IS ABSOLUTELY
PRICELESS.

274

>> LOOK AT THAT DOLPHIN!

275
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,143

DEE DO.

THIS REWARD WITH JUST MY

ALLIANCE, BUT EVEN THOUGH I'M
NOT WITH MY FRIENDS, I'M GLAD

279
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,989
I'M HERE AND CAN CONTROL THE
CONVERSATION.

START.

285
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,791
I WAS SO PUMPED TO WIN THIS
REWARD, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GET

286
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,335
SOME MORE FOOD, AND WITH
IMMUNITY RIGHT AROUND THE

287
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,004
CORNER, I'M GOING TO NEED AS
MUCH ENERGY AS I CAN JUST TO

288
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,213
OH, THIS IS SO GOOD.

289
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:41,010
I HAVE ONLY LOST ONE CHALLENGE
MY ENTIRE "SURVIVOR" CAREER SO

290
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,513
FAR, AND WITH A FULL BELLY, I
HAVE A BETTER CHANCE THAN MOST

291
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,223
TO WIN THE NEXT IMMUNITY.

292
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,019
>> WE'RE GOING IN, HOMEY!

293
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,856
>> IT'S DEFINITELY NIGHT NOOIS
TO BE AWAY FROM CAMP AND HAVE

294
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,024
FOOD AND HAVE THE OPTION TO JUST
KIND OF HANG OUT.

295
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,695
BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S 10 PLAYERS
AND THERE'S AN ALLIANCE OF

296
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,613
SEVEN.

297
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,198
AND YOU HAVE THREE HEALERS ON
THE BOTTOM.

298
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,034
SO I HAVE NO CONTROL IN THIS
GAME RIGHT NOW.

299
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,995
I'M DEFINITELY IN TROUBLE, BUT
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN TROUBLE, AND

300
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,997
SOMEHOW, SOME WAY, I'VE STUCK
AROUND.

301
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,916
>> GET IT, BRO.

302
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,625
>> I'M NOT GETTING IT.

303
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,668
I'M SEEING WHAT'S IN THE MIDDLE.

304
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,420
>> HE'S LOOKING FOR A CLUE.

305
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,088
>> YOU HAVE TO GIVE JOE PROPS.

306
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,423
HE NEVER STOPS.

307
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,552
>> I PLAY THE GAME 24 HOURS A
DAY.

308
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,970
THE IDOL IS UNDERNEATH THE BOAT!

309
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,182
<i>( LAUGHTER )</i>
I CAME OUT HERE TO PLAY.

310
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:28,891
I NEED TO GO.

311
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,976
I LIKE GOING 100 MILES AN HOUR.

312
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,561
I DON'T LIKE SLOWING DOWN.

313
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,521
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

314
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,941
I'VE BEEN AN AGGRESSIVE PLAYER
SINCE DAY ONE.

315
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,568
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO
THAT.

316
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,445
IT WILL PROBABLY COST ME THE
GAME, BUT THAT'S ME.

317
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,071
>> LIFE'S PRETTY GOOD, DUDE.

318
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,948
>> CAN'T COMPLAIN.

319
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,075
>> THERE'S THE FLAG RIGHT THERE.

320
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,201

>> IS THAT THEM?

325
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,669
>> OH, MY GOD!

326
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,211

MOVE ON.

336
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,280
AND I NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO TALK TO BEN BECAUSE I'M

TRYING TO BUILD AS MANY
RELATIONSHIPS AND MAXIMIZE MY

338

BEST-CASE SCENARIO IS?

OH, MY GOD, OKAY!

350
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,307
>> TRUTH IS POWER IN THIS GAME,
AND I NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW

351
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,350
I'M TELLING THEM THE TRUTH.

352
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,186
>> FREAKING RYAN HAS THE IDOL.

353
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:02,693
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE ECSTATIC
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE NOW I KNOW

354
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,944
COLE DOESN'T HAVE IT.

355
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,113
INFORMATION IS KEY IN THIS GAME
SO ALL THIS TRUST GETTING PUT

356
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,782
INTO ME IS GOING TO HELP ME
LATER ON IN THE GAME, TOO.

357
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,619
AND I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING TO ANYBODY ABOUT THIS.

358
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,331
BUT THIS PROVES THAT RYAN IS OUT
HERE TO PLAY AND WIN $1 MILLION.

359
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,209
SO I'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THIS

360
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,963
SEVEN HAS TO STICK TOGETHER
>> AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST ME

361
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:23,255
NOW.

362
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:23,631
>> YUP.

363
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,006
WE'RE GOOD.

364
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:34,099
>> YUP.

365
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:40,814
>> YUP.

366
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,024
>> RIGHT HERE.

367
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,693
>> THAT THING IS DISGUSTING,
MAN.

368
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,864
>> HE'S AFTER SOMETHING.

369
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,407
>> I'LL NEVER GIVE UP.

370
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,036
I USUALLY FIND IT WHEN I WANT WH
I WANT TO GIVE UP.

371
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:54,870
I NOTICE THAT.

372
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,206
THAT'S HOW IT WAS FOR MY SECOND
IDOL.

373
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,333
>> RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A GROUP OF
SEVEN THAT ARE JUST RUNNING THIS

374
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,212
GAME, AND I'M DEFINITELY ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.

375
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,214
NOT ONE PERSON WANTS TO MAKE A
MOVE.

376
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,217
I'VE BEEN DIGGING FOR AN IDOL
THAT PROBABLY IS NOT THERE, BUT

377
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,344
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.

378
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:15,015
ONE THING I DO HAVE IS, YOU
KNOW, PEOPLE FEEL LIKE I AM, SO

379
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,893
I'M GOING TO START PUSHING
BUTTONS MORE AND I'M GOING TO

380
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:21,730
GET ENOUGH PEOPLE SO UPSET AT ME
THAT THEY'RE LIKE, "YO, LET'S

381
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,191
JUST KEEP THIS DUDE AROUND
BECAUSE WE CAN GET RID OF HIM AT

382
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,235
ANY POINT," AND AT SOME POINT I
CAN MAKE A MOVE.

383
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,237
>> IS JOE OUT THERE DIGGING
AGAIN?

384
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,529
>> YES.

385
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:28,946
>> YES.

386
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,781
>> GOOD FOR JOE.

387
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,033
HE'S STRANGELY ENTERTAINING.

388
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:33,909
RIGHT?

389
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,078
ISN'T HE, LIKE, STRANGELY
ENTERTAINING?

390
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,746
>> NO.

391
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,874
LIKE, I THINK THERE'S GAME PLAY
AND THERE'S JUST BEING...

392
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,418
>> WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

393
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,921
THE THING IS THAT, LIKE-- WE'LL
TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

394
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,382
>> WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME
>> WE WERE.

395
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,134
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU
DIGGING DOWN THERE.

396
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,761
>> DON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT ME
BECAUSE I GOT HERE.

397
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,471
YOU HAVE TO KEEP TALKING.

398
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,473
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING,
JOE.

399
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,683
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT.

400
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,395
>> I KNOW, BUT MIKE KNOWS THE
RELATIONSHIP ME AND HIM HAVE.

401
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,604
HE CAN CONTINUE TALKING.

402
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,442
>> NEWS FLASH: EVERYONE TALKS
ABOUT PEOPLE BEHIND THEIR BACKS.

403
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,443
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

404
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,777
IT'S THE GAME, RIGHT?

405
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,945
>> ASHLEY IS GETTING FEISTY.

406
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,196
I LIKE IT.

407
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,282
>> WELL, SHE NEEDS TO BECAUSE--
>> I DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING

408
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,450
YOU SAY I NEED TO DO.

409
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,118
>> SHE'S GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE
FINAL THREE BEING A GOAT.

410
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,913
>> YOU CAN DO YOUR GAME, AND WE
ALL HAVE RESPECT FOR IT, BUT YOU

411
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,290
NEED TO HAVE THE SAME RESPECT
FOR EVERYONE ELSE.

412
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,751
>> I'M HAVING RESPECT.

413
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,335

FRONT OF YOU.

OH, MY GOD, YOU DON'T LISTEN TO
ANYONE.

417
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,343
>> I WOULD-- I WOULD USE YOU AS
A GOAT.

418
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,971
YOU'RE, LIKE, THE IDEAL
DEFINITION OF A GOAT.

419

SOMEBODY WILL BE THE NINTH

520
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,562
PERSON VOTEDLY OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

521
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,731
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

522
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,817
WE'LL GET IT ON.

523
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:14,708
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY
TAKE YOUR SPOT ON YOUR BOX.

524
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,587
YOU'LL RELEASE YOUR POLES.

525
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,588
EVERYBODY IS GOOD.

526
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,591
AND THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

527
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:30,557
ANOTHER BRAND-NEW "SURVIVOR"
TORTURE DEVICE THAT OFFERS VERY

528
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,767
LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM.

529
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,436
YOU GO TOO LOW, YOU'RE IN
TROUBLE.

530
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,565
IF YOU STAND TOO HIGH, YOU'RE IN
TROUBLE.

531
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:43,695
THIS ONE REQUIRES A LITTLE MORE
FINESSE.

532
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:50,160
THAT URN, FULL OF WATER,
HOVERING ABOVE YOUR FIRE.

533
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,790
ASHLEY IS THE FIRST TO DROP AND
SEES HOW LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM

534
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,665
THERE IS.

535
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,959
YOU CAN HAVE A SPOT OVER HERE ON
THE BENCH.

536
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,086
ASHLEY IS FIRST OUT.

537
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,298
AND WE ARE DOWN TO NINE PEOPLE
LEFT IN THIS CHALLENGE.

538
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,635
AND YOU'RE ALREADY IN A VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION, EVEN

539
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,513
SECONDS INTO THIS CHALLENGE.

540
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,809
SQUATTING IS NEVER FUN.

541
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:20,607
DR. MIKE DROPS, AND WE ARE DOWN
TO EIGHT.

542
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,862
JP MOVING AROUND A LOT, FEELS
VERY COMFORTABLE.

543
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,657
HOW FAR HE CAN PUSH IT.

544
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,703
DEVON MOVING AROUND.

545
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,664
JOE WITH A LITTLE MOVEMENT.

546
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,665
>> ALWAYS MOVING, JEFF.

547
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,836
ALWAYS MOVING.

548
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,549
>> Jeff: COLE TRYING TO FIND A
NEW SPOT.

549
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,675
AND THERE IT IS.

550
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,678
JP PUSHES TOO FAR.

551
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,804
JP IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

552
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:56,643
WE ARE DOWN TO SEVEN.

553
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,399
>> NO WAY.

554
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,610
>> Jeff: DEVON LOOKS DOWN TO
CHECK OUT CHRISSY'S FORM, AND

555
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,905
DEVON DROPS.

556
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,991
NEXT TO HIM, JOE DROPS.

557
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:11,992
JOE IS OUT.

558
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,704
DEVON IS OUT.

559
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,707
ASHLEY MADE ONE COMMENT ABOUT
CHRISSY'S FORM, AND IT TOOK OUT

560
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,378
TWO GUYS WITHIN SECONDS.

561
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:33,597
WE ARE DOWN TO FIVE.

562
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,224
JUST LIKE THAT, BEN DROPS.

563
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:36,766
BEN IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

564
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,561
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

565
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:46,735
AND WE ARE LEFT WITH FOUR--
CHRISSY, COLE, LAUREN, AND RYAN.

566
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:52,574
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S YOUR
DAY TO STEP UP WITH A MILLION

567
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,576
DOLLARS ON THE LINE AND AN URN
FULL OF WATER JUST WAITING TO

568
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,455
PUT OUT YOUR FIRE.

569
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:58,914
FIRE, SYMBOLIC OF
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT AT

570
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,582
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

571
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,584
YOU'RE NEVER CERTAIN AT TRIBAL,
EVER.

572
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:27,776
>> Jeff: CHRISSY HAS NOT
CHANGED HER APPROACH AT ALL.

573
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,946
COLE A LITTLE BIT OF BEND,
TRYING TO FIND SOME RELIEF.

574
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,947
LAUREN LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN.

575
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,951
AND RYAN ALL ALONE ON THE END,
BUT STILL IN IT.

576
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,743
HOW YOU DOING, RYAN?

577
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,746
>> I'M A SURVIVOR.

578
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,289
I'M GOOD.

579
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,916
>> THAT A BOY, RYAN.

580
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,960
>> Jeff: THAT REALLY DOES SUM
IT UP.

581
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:45,835
YOU'RE OUT HERE.

582
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:53,802
THAT'S MOST OF IT.

583
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,136
CHRISSY CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE.

584
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,805
YOU COULD SEE HER FACE GIVE OUT.

585
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,431
CHRISSY OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

586
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,268
AND WE ARE DOWN TO THREE.

587
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,144
>> OH!

588
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:07,691
>> COLE, YOU LOOK GOOD.

589
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,316
EVERYONE'S DOING GOOD.

590
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:17,325
>> YOU GUYS ARE DOING GREAT.

591
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,786
>> Jeff: RYAN CANNOT HANG
ANYMORE.

592
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,206
RYAN DROPS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE,
AND WE ARE DOWN TO TWO, AND THEY

593
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:29,170
ARE SIDE BY SIDE-- COLE AND
LAUREN IN A SHOWDOWN.

594
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,965
COLE NOW WITH SOME MOVEMENT.

595
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,176
>> YOUR THING LOOKS LIKE IT'S
LEANING A LITTLE BIT.

596
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,887
>> Jeff: COLE JUST GAVE UP
THAT NECKLACE, WANTS TO PUT IT

597
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:43,059
BACK ON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

598
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,355
COLE DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THAT
LOW LEVEL BUT DOESN'T SEEM THE

599
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,358
LEAST BIT WORRIED AS HE GOES
RIGHT BACK UP.

600
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:59,451
STRETCHING IT OUT.

601
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,455
LAUREN FOR THE FIRST TIME
SHOWING SOME REAL MOVEMENT.

602
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:12,380
>> DON'T GO TOO HIGH, LAUREN.

603
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:18,511
>> LAUREN, YOU CAN'T GO ANY
HIGHER, OKAY?

604
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,765
>> Jeff: RAWREN TRYING TO
STRETCH OUT.

605
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:31,858
ANY KIND OF RELIEF FEELS SO
GOOD!

606
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:40,742
ANY KIND OF RELIEF FEELS SO
GOOD!

607
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,576
>> OH!

608
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,786
>> Jeff: AND OUT OF NOWHERE,
COLE DROPS.

609
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,662
HE'S OUT!

610
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,540
LAUREN WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

611
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,125
>> THAT A GIRL!

612
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,877
>> Jeff: SAFE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

613
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,461
>> MY BACK'S KILLING ME.

614
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,129
>> Jeff: GREAT CHALLENGE!

615
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,256
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

616
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,970
IMPRESSIVE.

617
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,057
>> Jeff: LAUREN, COME ON OVER.

618
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,724
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

619
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,769
>> THAT ISA GIRL!

620
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,104
>> Jeff: LAUREN, INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

621
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,106
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, CANNOT BE VOTED OUT.

622
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,108
SADLY FOR THE REST OF YOU,
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE NINTH

623
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,276
PERSON VOTED OUT, SECOND MEMBER
OF OUR JURY.

624
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,569
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.

625
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,070
>> THANKS.

626
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,115
>> Jeff: CONGRATS.

627
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,159
>> IT'S DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE I
KNOW I HAD MY CHANCE TO SAVE

628
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,620
MYSELF TODAY IN EYE CHALLENGE,
AND I ALREADY HAVE A TARGET ON

629
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,788
MY BACK.

630
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,248
BUT THEY DON'T LIKE JOE, SO
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL ALL TAKE JOE

631
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,893
♪ ♪ ♪
>> LAUREN, GREAT JOB.

632
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,519
>> THANK YOU.

633
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,019
>> LAUREN, KILLING IT TODAY.

634
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,148
>> YOU DID FAB TASK!

635
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:57,777
>> LAUREN PULLED IT OUT AND BEAT
COLE, SO COULDN'T BE HAPPIER,

636
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,945
YOU KNOW.

637
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,656
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT COLE
DID NOT WIN IMMUNITY TODAY

638
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:04,492
BECAUSE COLE IS THE BIGGEST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE THREAT HERE.

639
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,076
I NEED WATER.

640
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,327
>> ALL RIGHT, I DO, TOO.

641
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,038
I'M SURE OTHER PEOPLE DO, TOO.

642
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:09,497
ANYONE NEED WATER?

643
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,874
>> ARE YOU GOING?

644
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,000
>> MIGHT AS WELL.

645
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,378
>> WE'RE GETTING THE MAIN TARGET
OUT, OUR HARD TARGET.

646
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,299
BUT THERE'S A BIG FEAR OF A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AND THAT'S

647
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:23,178
WHY WE CAN'T JUST PLACE ALL OUR
VOTES ON ONE HEALER, SO WE HAVE

648
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:28,224
TO SPLIT THE VOTES INTO A FOUR
AND THREE.

649
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,894
THE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN, RIGHT,
THE BIGGEST WORRY TONIGHT IS AN

650
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,145
IDOL.

651
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:36,357
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE THE
FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN OUT, AND DO

652
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,195
FOUR COLE, THREE MIKE-- ARE
YOU--

653
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,362
>> WHAT?

654
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,491
>> NOW WE'RE JUST COMPLETELY
TAKING JOE OFF THE CHOPPING

655
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:44,824
BLOCK?

656
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,450
>> RIGHT.

657
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,993
>> BUT WHY MIKE AND NOT JOE?

658
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:47,994
>> BECAUSE THIS IS WHY.

659
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,370
>> I'M PISSED.

660
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,538
JOE, HE'S LIKE A RAT.

661
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,416
YOU LOSE TRACK OF HIM FOR ONE
SECOND, AND HE'S OFF TRYING TO

662
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,375
FIND ANOTHER IDOL.

663
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,044
HE'S OFF LOOKING FOR ADVANTAGES.

664
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,838
HE'S VERY DANGEROUS IN MAY BE
WAYS, AND I THINK WE'RE ALL JUST

665
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,048
SICK OF HIM, AND HE NEEDS TO GO.

666
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:05,053
>> ASHLEY, ASHLEY--
>> HE'S GOING TO SPEND EVERY

667
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,930
SECOND--
>> WE GOT LUCKY TODAY.

668
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,058
FOUR FOR COLE, THREE FOR MIKE.

669
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,436
>> YOU HAVE TO GET PAST THAT
RIGHT THIS SECOND.

670
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:13,937
HE'S NOT A THREAT.

671
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,230
>> YES, HE IS.

672
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,273
HE FINDS IDOLS NONSTOP.

673
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:21,194
SOMEBODY ELSE PLAYS AN IDESOL--
IF MIKE PLAYS AN IDOL, IF MIKE

674
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,404
PLAYS AN IDOL, HE COULD BE BACK
IN PLACE.

675
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,531
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.

676
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,909
>> ASHLEY, IT'S A GROUP
DECISION, FOUR FOR COLE, THREE

677
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,369
FOR MIKE.

678
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,412
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, ONE OF
THOSE TWO IS GOING HOME.

679
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,875
>> BEN TOLD ME TO VOTE COLE
BECAUSE HE IS A HUGE PHYSICAL

680
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,584
THREAT.

681
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,585
I'M GETTING SUPER ANNOYED.

682
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,920
I DON'T NEED TO BE TOLD WHAT TO
DO RIGHT NOW.

683
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:43,132
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO VOTE JOE

684
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,636
BECAUSE I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE
WEIGHS THESE OPTIONS IN MY HEAD

685
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,470
RIGHT NOW.

686
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,972
IT'S GONNA KILL ME NOT TO VOTE
FOR JOE.

687
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,308
I'M, LIKE, PUTTING OUT OTHER
IDEAS.

688
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,811
WE'RE SPLITTING TWO VOTES, COLE,
MIKE.

689
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,271
>> IT'S A STEAM ROLLING
SITUATION.

690
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,730
>> I WANT JOE GONE.

691
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,107
>> I WANT TO DO JOE.

692
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,108
>> I DO, TOO.

693
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,276
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR BEN?

694
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,613
>> ARE WE ALL JUST GOG SAY,
"SORRY, BEN, WE'RE NOT WITH YOU

695
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,115
ON THIS ONE?"
>> YES, THIS IS NOT A

696
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,993
DICTATORSHIP.

697
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,329
>> TELL ME WHO'S EVERYBODY
VOTING FOR SO I CAN VOTE, YOU

698
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,122
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

699
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:14,747
>> YEAH.

700
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,293
>> TELL ME WHO TO VOTE FOR.

701
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,294
I'M OKAY DOING WHATEVER.

702
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,254
I DON'T CARE.

703
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,340
>> NOW--
>> HUH...

704
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,049
>> LISTEN.

705
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,261
BETWEEN YOU AND ME... IT'S COLE.

706
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:28,595
OKAY?

707
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,470
>> UH-HUH.

708
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,472
>> JUST DON'T TELL JOE.

709
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,268
>> YEAH.

710
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:39,439
>> ON FAITH FOR TONIGHT'S TRIBAL
COUNCIL, IF I COULD BELIEVE BEN.

711
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,940
BUT HOW MUCH CAN I TRUST BEN?

712
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:41,983
I CAN'T.

713
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,319
EVERY PERSON THAT I'VE TRUSTED
HAS BETRAYED MY TRUST.

714
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,195
SO I'M NOT PLAYING THEIR GAME.

715
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,075
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING TO SEND ONE
OF THESE BIG THREATS HOME.

716
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,163
>> IF THEY'RE SMART, THEY'LL DO
COLE, AND THEN ME.

717
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:55,997
AS FAR AS THE SPLIT.

718
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,165
>> UH-HUH.

719
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,208
HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH THIS
WHOLE SITUATION.

720
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:04,797
THEY'RE DOING THIS NOW WE HAVE
TO GET JOE OUT BECAUSE HE'S SO

721
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,008
ATROCIOUS, BUT THEY'RE STILL
PLANNING TO VOTE COLE OUT.

722
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,801
I THINK THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN
TURN THIS UPSIDE DOWN.

723
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,385
>> I KNOW THERE IS.

724
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,013
>> AND GET BEN OUT.

725
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,223
IT CHANGES EVERYTHING.

726
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:19,354
>> THE HUSTLERS AND HEROES'
MENTALITY ARE JUST PLAYING FOR

727
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,271
THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

728
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,606
AND IT'S STUPID.

729
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,568
SO BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GOING TO
MAKE THE WORLD IMPLODE BY

730
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:30,448
PLAYING MY IDOL.

731
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,283
EENIE-MEENIE-MINEY-MOE, WHO AM I
GOING TO GIVE IT TO?

732
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,369
IT MIGHT BE HYDRAULIC TONIGHT.

733
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,871
IT'S GOOD BIG OR GO HOME TIME.

734
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:40,083
>> WHAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IS
THE LOGIC BEHIND VOTING FOR MIKE

735
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,292
VERSUS VOTING FOR JOE.

736
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,088
>> I WAS TRYING TO FLUSH AN
IDOL, IF MIKE HAD ONE, FOR NEXT

737
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,214
ONE.

738
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,590
>> I DON'T WANT TO KEEP JOE HERE
WITH AN IDOL OUT THERE.

739
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,342
JOE IS A HUGE THREAT TO ME.

740
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,551
>> RIGHT.

741
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,261
>> I KNOW COLE IS A BIG PHYSICAL
THREAT, BUT I DON'T THINK COLE

742
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,180
IS NECESSARILY GOING TO WIN
EVERY CHALLENGE.

743
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:57,725
>> BUT THIS--
>> WHAT IF MIKE HAS THE IDOL?

744
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,228
I'VE BEEN VOTING WITH BEN SINCE
DAY ONE, BUT, APPARENTLY, WE

745
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:04,190
CANNOT ASK QUESTIONS AND SAY,
"WHAT IS THE LOGIC BEHIND VOTING

746
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:08,403
FOR DR. MIKE?"
I AM MORE NERVOUS ABOUT JOE

747
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,362
FINDING IDOLS.

748
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,198
THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED TO
VOTE FOR JOE.

749
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:16,119
>> I JUST TOLD MIKE TO VOTE FOR
COLE.

750
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,370
INSTEAD OF JOE.

751
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,957
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE A DICTATOR
HERE, BUT FOR MY GAME, I DON'T

752
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,251
WANT JOE GONE BECAUSE EVERYONE
ALREADY CAN'T STAND THE GUY.

753
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,713
UNFORTUNATELY, SOME PEOPLE,
THEY'RE PLAYING WITH THEIR HEART

754
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,589
AND THEIR MORALS.

755
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,677
IN "SURVIVOR," HEART AND MORALS
DON'T GET YOU A MILLION DOLLARS.

756
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,221
>> PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FEEL A
TINY BIT STEAM ROLLED BY YOU.

757
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,432
>> NO, NO, THEY'RE NOT.

758
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,392
YOU MIGHT AND ASHLEY MIGHT.

759
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,602
IT'S THE SAFEST BET POSSIBLE.

760
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,898
>> AT THIS POINT, IT'S SORT OF
BECOME BEN'S WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.

761
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,276
I KNOW THERE IS A GAME STRATEGY,
AND THE GAME STRATEGY SAYS GET

762
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,446
COLE OUT FIRST, GET JOE OUT
SECOND.

763
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,615
BUT, FRANKLY, THERE'S NO BIGGER
STRATEGIC THREAT THAN JOE.

764
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,953
AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT
BEN'S PLAN, BUT I BELIEVE THAT

765
00:33:59,036 --> 00:33:59,912
ASHLEY FEELS THAT WAY AS WELL.

766
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,124
THERE ARE A LOT OF THREATS LEFT
IN THIS GAME.

767
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:13,217
NOW WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO
DO.

768
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:20,641
NOW WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO
DO.

769
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:26,939
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

770
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,484
>> I NEED TO YOU FOLLOW MY LEAD
TONIGHT.

771
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:35,448
TRUST ME.

772
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:47,001
>> Jeff: DESI, VOTED OUT AT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

773
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,506
ALL RIGHT, SO, JOE, WE START
WITH THREE TRIBES, INSTANT

774
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:51,923
ANIMOSITY.

775
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:52,673
THEN WE SWAP.

776
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,801
NOW THERE'S SOME
CROSS-POLLINATION.

777
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,843
BUT NOW WE'RE 24 DAYS IN.

778
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,470
YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE THE END.

779
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,222
SO WHERE IS THE GAME RIGHT NOW?

780
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,475
>> WELL, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW,
THE GAME IS LOST.

781
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:07,230
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT PART OF THE
ROUNDTABLE, AND THE ROUNDTABLE

782
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,147
CONSISTS OF SEVEN.

783
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,858
MIKE'S NOT PART OF THE
ROUNDTABLE, NEITHER.

784
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,819
>> I'M THE COWT JESTER.

785
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,487
>> Jeff: JOE WHO ARE THE THREE
NOT IN IT?

786
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,406
>> THE HEALERS ARE THE ONLY ONES
NOT PART OF THE ROUNDTABLE AT

787
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,658
THIS MOMENT.

788
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,410
>> Jeff: DOES IT SEEM OBVIOUS
IT'S JOE, YOU, AND MIKE THAT ARE

789
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,620
IN TROUBLE?

790
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,331
>> YES, I FEEL LIKE ME AND JOE
ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THE

791
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,543
CHOPPING BLOCK, AND I'M NOT
INVOLVED IN ANY STRATEGIES OR

792
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,379
THERE'S NO GAME PLAY GOING ON
WITH ME AT ALL.

793
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,715
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, THERE'S BEEN
A LOT GOING ON AT TRIBAL LATELY

794
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,550
WITH PEOPLE HAVING IT OUT.

795
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,551
WHAT'S THE VIBE AT CAMP RIGHT
NOW?

796
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:42,348
>> THE VIBE AT CAMP AS OF
YESTERDAY WAS EXTREMELY

797
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,599
DIFFICULT.

798
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,602
JOE CAME AFTER ASHLEY AND I AND
IT WAS JUST A NONSTOP BARRAGE OF

799
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,228
INSULTS.

800
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,563
IT WENT FAR PAST GAME PLAY.

801
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:54,569
>> CAN I--
>> YES, PLEASE, MIKE.

802
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,571
>> HONESTLY, I AM DISAPPOINTED
IN MY TRIBE.

803
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,573
I BELIEVE THAT "SURVIVOR"
REPRESENTS SOCIETY.

804
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,701
WE HAVE TO PLAY WITH JUSTIFIABLE
MORAL AND ETHICAL CODES OF

805
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,911
CONDUCT HERE.

806
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,874
SO SAYING JOE IS OFFENDING US
AND PAINTING HIM AS A PARIAH BUT

807
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,294
THEN NOT VOTING HIM OUT IS NOT
PLAYING THIS GAME OF HIGH MORAL

808
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,338
CHARACTER, AND IF THAT MEANS ME
SPEAKING UP I PUT A TARGET ON MY

809
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,423
BACK, FINE.

810
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,425
BUT I TRY TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH
HIGH MORAL CHARACTER.

811
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,303
SO IF BEN IS KING ARTHUR AT THE
ROUNDTABLE, I AM HAPPY TO BE THE

812
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:26,142
STATUE OF LIBERTY IN AMERICA,
BECAUSE AMERICA IS GOING TO BEAT

813
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,268
IN THE END.

814
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,604
>> Jeff: LAUREN, IS THE
MISSING ELEMENT IN MIKE'S THESIS

815
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:35,026
THE WORD "JUSTIFIABLE?"
MEANING, YOU JUSTIFY YOUR VOTE

816
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,778
BASED ON GAME PLAY, STRATEGY,
TRUST, LACK OF TRUST?

817
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:42,116
BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY,
"OH, I HAVE MY OWN REASONS,

818
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,242
SORRY."

819
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,285
>> I TOTALLY AGREE WITH WHAT
HE'S SAYING IF WE WEREN'T

820
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,536
PLAYING "SURVIVOR."

821
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,288
>> THE FACT OF THE MATTER, IS
LAUREN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

822
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,207
JUSTIFY HOW YOU--
>> I DON'T ACT THAT WAY.

823
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:54,253
>> MAKE JOE INTO A PARIAH AND
THEN NOT VOTE FOR HIM.

824
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,757
I THINK YOU'RE SHOWING POOR
MORAL CHARACTER.

825
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,967
>> DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE
SHOVEL AND BURY YOURSELF.

826
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,470
THE HOLE IS DEEPER AND DEEPER
AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OPEN YOUR

827
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,638
MOUTH.

828
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,641
>> JEFF, I THINK THE HARDEST
PART ABOUT OUR DECISION TONIGHT

829
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:11,771
IS HOW DO WE VOTE TONIGHT SO
THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AT THE

830
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,313
NEXT TRIBAL.

831
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,524
>> WHO IS "WE" CHRISSY.

832
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,817
>> THE ALLIANCE OF SEVEN.

833
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,361
>> Jeff: COLE, WHEN CHRISSY
WAS TALKING AND SAYING, "LOOK,

834
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,363
IT'S NOT JUST TONIGHT.

835
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:23,824
IT'S THE NEXT ONE AND THE NEXT
ONE AND FROM HEREON OUT."

836
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,451
IS THAT A LITTLE CONCERNING?

837
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,955
>> YEAH, I FELT LIKE HER
STATEMENT WAS PRETTY CLEAR AT

838
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,206
ME.

839
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,375
I MEAN, I'M THE PERSON WHO COULD
BE ABLE TO SCREW IT UP NEXT TIME

840
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,376
BY WINNING THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

841
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,462
>> JEFF, THESE PEOPLE LIVE IN A
FANTASY WORLD.

842
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,631
NOBODY IS PLAYING THE GAME.

843
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:42,885
EVERYBODY IS WAITING FOR THE
MAGICAL SEVEN, AND BOOM, THEN

844
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,511
EVERYBODY STARTS PLAYING.

845
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,012
I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.

846
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,849
>> MAYBE WE'LL CHANGE THAT AT
SOME POINT IN TIME.

847
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,559
>> IT WILL BE FOUR HEROES AND
THREE HUSTLERS.

848
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,521
WHEN ARE PEOPLE GOING TO REALIZE
THREE DOES NOT BEAT FOUR?

849
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:58,067
>> JEFF, YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE
NUMBERS ON YOUR HAND AND DO ALL

850
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,362
THE COUNTING YOU WANT, BUT YOU
CANNOT CALCULATE RELATIONSHIPS,

851
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,365
EMOTION, YOU CANNOT CALCULATE
DECEPTION.

852
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,491
THE GAME HAPPENS IN EVERY
CONVERSATION YOU HAVE.

853
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,617
YOU CAN'T CALCULATE THOSE
THINGS.

854
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,037
>> Jeff: AND, BEN, WITH
ASHLEY'S COMMENT, SHE BRINGS IT

855
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,873
ALL BACK TO MIKE'S ORIGINAL
PREMISE OFFING ABOUT A SOCIETY.

856
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,208
IT'S NOT JUST NUMBERS.

857
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,668
IT'S THE RELATIONSHIPS.

858
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,755
>> THE RELATIONSHIPS WE BUILD,
TWO, THREE OF THOSE ARE GOING TO

859
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,048
GET YOU TO THE END.

860
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,593
THE THING THAT PUTS JOE OUTSIDE
OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS IS JOE'S

861
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,720
MOUTH.

862
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,015
HE TALKS ABOUT THE ROUNDTABLE,
THE KING AND HIS KNIGHTS.

863
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,600
BUT HE'S THE ONLY ONE LIVING IN
A FANTASY WORLD RIGHT NOW.

864
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,604
>> Jeff: I'M FASCINATED WITH
THIS BECAUSE COLE HAS SOMEHOW

865
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:40,526
MANAGED TO SHRINK HIS BODY AS IF
TO SAY, "MAYBE NO ONE WILL

866
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,527
REMEMBER I'M HERE."

867
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,530
>> THANKS, JEFF.

868
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:49,076
IT CAME IN PRETTY GRIM BUT WHO
KNOWS, THERE'S SO MUCH STIRRED

869
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,453
UP AND HIM OPENING HIS MOUTH AND
MAYBE THAT'S GOOD FOR ME.

870
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:54,665
>> Jeff: I SEE HEADS, JOE HAS
BEEN TALKING, MIKE'S BEEN

871
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,583
TALKING.

872
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,586
>> THAT'S PLAYING THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR"!

873
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,087
>> Jeff: BEN IS TALKING.

874
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,255
IT'S CHAOS RIGHT NOW.

875
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:01,756
>> LADIES?

876
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,424
>> YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

877
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,216
>> LET'S VOTE.

878
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,426
>> WE'RE READY.

879
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,971
>> MIKE, ARE YOU READY OR DO YOU
WANT TO KEEP GROOG I'M GOOD.

880
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:13,267
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT'S BEEN
A CRAZY TRIBAL.

881
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,936
LET'S FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S GOG
LAND.

882
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,604
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

883
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:21,567
LAUREN, YOU'RE UP.

884
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:59,480
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

885
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,649
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

886
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:08,656
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

887
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:16,831
>> I THINK AMERICA'S GOING TO
STAY ONE MORE DAY.

888
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,166
YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR, YOUR
HUNGRY.

889
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,964
I'M PLAYING IT FOR ME.

890
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,467
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

891
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,679
ANY VOTES CAST FOR MIKE WILL NOT
COUNT.

892
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,682
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

893
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:40,896
FIRST VOTE, BEN.

894
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,355
MIKE.

895
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:45,860
DOES NOT COUNT.

896
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,277
MIKE.

897
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:53,200
DOES NOT COUNT.

898
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,034
COLE.

899
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,579
THAT'S ONE VOTE BEN, ONE VOTE
COLE.

900
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,037
COLE.

901
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:02,001
TWO VOTES COLE.

902
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:02,835
COLE.

903
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:06,755
THAT'S THREE VOTES COLE, ONE
VOTE BEN.

904
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,549
COLE.

905
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:12,928
FOUR VOTES COLE.

906
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,265
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY, COLE.

907
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:16,849
IT'S FIVE.

908
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:17,558
THAT'S ENOUGH.

909
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:22,855
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

910
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,697
COLE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

911
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,532
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

912
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,158
HAVE FUN OUT THERE.

913
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,701
>> Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

914
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,745
>> GOOD GAME, BUD.

915
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,913
>> YOU, TOO.

916
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:47,379
>> Jeff: WELL, ALLIANCES ARE
THE CORNERSTONE OF "SURVIVOR."

917
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,715
BUT AS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
DWINDLE, THOSE ON THE BOTTOM GET

918
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:53,135
DESPERATE, AND IT GETS MORE
DIFFICULT TO KEEP ALLIANCES

919
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:53,594
TOGETHER.

920
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,094
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

921
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:54,887
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

922
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,724
GOOD NIGHT.

923
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:05,147
Captioning funded by CBS

924
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,316
Captioned by

925

>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

926
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,450
>> Jeff:
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

927
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,409
"SURVIVOR."

928
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,786
>> THE ALLIANCE OF SEVEN SEEMS
SET IN STONE.

929
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,288
>> JOE AND MIKE ARE DEAD MEN
WALKING.

930
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,082
>> Jeff: BUT THEY START TO
CRUMBLE FROM WITHIN.

931
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,918
>> THIS WHOLE TRUST IN THE SEVEN
ALLIANCE IS CRAP.

932
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,629
IF YOU'RE STUPID ENOUGH TO
REALLY THINK IT'S GOING TO LAST,

933
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,630
THEN SOMETHING'S WRONG.

934
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,881
>> WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS.

935
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:35,803
>> STAY TUNED, I THINK IT'S
ABOUT TO GET REALLY GOOD.

936
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,806
>> I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE JOE
INSTEAD OF ME.

937
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,976
EVERYONE IS GUNNING FOR ME
BECAUSE THEY SEE ME AS A

938
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,851
PHYSICAL THREAT.

939
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,979
I'M SO GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL TO
BE HERE.

940
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,149
I PLAYED HARD AND NO REGRETS AT
ALL.

941
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,777
THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY WAS WHEN
I GOT TO GO FISHING AND HANG OUT

942
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,987
WITH JESSICA.

943
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,697
I HOPE THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE
HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAYS IN THE

944
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,823
FUTURE.
