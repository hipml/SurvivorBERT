1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,835
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,837
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,379
DROP YOUR BUFFS, WE ARE

4
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,172
SWITCHING TRIBES.

5
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,842
AFTER A SURPRISE SWITCH, THE NEW

6
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,218
GOTA TRIBE HAD ALL THE MUSCLE

7
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,678
WHILE THE NEW BIKAL TRIBE --

8
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,097
>> I LIKE THIS PURPLE, GUYS.

9
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,181
>> Jeff: -- DIDN'T.

10
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,142
BUT ON BOTH TRIBES THE FAVORITES

11
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:23,648
OUTNUMBERED THE FANS 4-3.

12
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,942
AT GOTA, FANS TOOK TURNS

13
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:26,526
THROWING EACH OTHER UNDER THE

14
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:26,693
BUS.

15
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,069
>> SHERRI, IF YOU WANT TO VOTE

16
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,363
HER OUT, WE'RE WITH YOU.

17
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:30,655
>> REYNOLD.

18
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,240
HE'S THE BIGGEST SALESMAN.

19
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,199
>> Jeff: BUT AT BIKAL, THE

20
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,619
FANS WERE A HOT KPHAODTY.

21
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,580
PHILLIP WANT TO RECRUIT JULIA.

22
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,789
WHILE CORRINE WANTED MICHAEL.

23
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,500
>> IF I WASN'T A MORON I WOULD

24
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,168
TURN ON MY ENTIRE ALLIANCE TO

25
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,170
ALIGN WITH THE GAY.

26
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,546
THAT'S HOW MUCH I LIKE GAYS.

27
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,840
>> HELLO PHILIPPINES!

28
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,175
>> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

29
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,801
CHALLENGE -- BIKAL APPEARS TO BE

30
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,343
ON SOME SORT OF MEDICATION

31
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,597
THEY'RE MOVING SO SLOW!

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,098
BIKAL FELL APART.

33
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:03,855
GOTA WINS IMMUNITY!

34
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,064
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL THE FANS KNEW

35
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,733
THEY WERE THE OBVIOUS TARGETS.

36
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,401
IS THERE A SENSE, MICHAEL, THAT

37
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,195
IS IT YOU, JULIA, OR MATT GOING

38
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:10,528
HOME TONIGHT?

39
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,155
>> 100%.

40
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,867
>> Jeff: IN THE END THEY WERE

41
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,075
RIGHT.

42
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,286
MATT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

43
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:18,995
13 ARE LEFT.

44
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:32,091
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

45
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,551
>> I'M SO SORRY.

46
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,219
LIKE, I REALLY --

47
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,720
>> DON'T BE SORRY.

48
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,346
>> IT CRUSHED ME TO HAVE TO LET

49
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,639
HIM GO.

50
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,306
I ADORED HIM.

51
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:38,640
>> LOVE MATT.

52
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,933
>> GREAT GUY.

53
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,768
BUT WE HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE AND

54
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,811
WE DECIDED TO KEEP YOU TWO.

55
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,271
>> THANK YOU TRIBAL COUNCIL

56
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,773
SUCKED.

57
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,191
MATT'S BEEN MY BOY SINCE DAY ONE

58
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,819
AND NOW I'M TOTALLY ON MY OWN.

59
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,487
YOU HONESTLY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO,

60
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,740
LIKE, REALLY EXPLAIN YOURSELVES.

61
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,366
I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO

62
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,409
BUILD TRUST WITH THESE GUYS AND

63
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,369
TRY TO BUILD FRIENDSHIPS AS WELL

64
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,162
SO THAT THEY WANT TO WORK WITH

65
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:05,208
ME AT THE MERGE.

66
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,960
I'M GREAT.

67
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:07,210
SERIOUSLY.

68
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,545
I'M HERE AND I'M --

69
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,047
>> I'M NOT LOOKING TO LOSE YOU,

70
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,214
SO --

71
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,048
>> I LIKE THAT.

72
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,299
I LIKE THAT WE CAN PLAY

73
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:13,550
TOGETHER.

74
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,802
>> I'M DEFINITELY WILLING TO

75
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,095
SACRIFICE ONE OF MY OWN TO KEEP

76
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,263
SOMEBODY ELSE AND I'M GOING TO

77
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,098
FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL NOT TO HAVE

78
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:20,431
IT BE MICHAEL.

79
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,350
HE'S NOT GOING HOME ON MY WATCH.

80
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,477
I WOULD LIKE TO DUMP PHILLIP AS

81
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,019
SOON AS POSSIBLE.

82
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,229
THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T MAKE

83
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,397
MOVES LIKE THAT THIS EARLY SO I

84
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,732
TRY REALLY HARD TO BE PATIENT

85
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,694
AND HOPE THAT THE TIME WILL COME

86
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,487
SOME TIME SOON.

87
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,572
YOU HAVE TO SURVIVE.

88
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,907
ONCE WE'RE AT THE MERGE WE'RE

89
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,491
KICKING ASS AND TAKING PEOPLE

90
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,367
NAMES.

91
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,410
WE'RE JUST TAKING PEOPLE OUT.

92
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,495
>> CORRINE CONSISTENTLY GOES AND

93
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,538
HAS CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE

94
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,915
LIKE MICHAEL AND THEN DOESN'T

95
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,417
DISCLOSE TO US THE NATURE OF THE

96
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,750
CONVERSATIONS.

97
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,294
AND FOR ME, THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

98
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,046
>> I WANT HER GONE.

99
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,463
>> NOT NEXT, THOUGH.

100
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,801
>> MAYBE.

101
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,179
I DON'T WANT HER GOING TO THE

102
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:00,388
MERGE.

103
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,681
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TOLD

104
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:01,848
HIM.

105
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,141
I WANT HER GONE.

106
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,225
>> SEE, HERE'S MY ONLY FEAR

107
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,685
ABOUT IT, STOCK?

108
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,895
WE DO THIS BEFORE THE MERGE, WE

109
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,396
MEET UP WITH OUR OLD TRIBE MATES

110
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,231
AND THEY'RE GOING TO THINK WHAT

111
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,482
THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?

112
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,109
THEY WON'T WANT TO WORK WITH US

113
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,444
BECAUSE WE TURNED ON ONE OF OUR

114
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:14,694
CORE SIX.

115
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,738
>> I WANT CORRINE TO BE THE NEXT

116
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,363
PERSON GONE BUT IF I CAN NOT GET

117
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,240
RID OF CORRINE AND HER NEW GAY

118
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,659
FRIEND, AS SHE SAID, HE'LL BE

119
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,411
THE ONE THAT GOES HOME NEXT.

120
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,245
THIS IS ME AS A FEDERAL AGENT, I

121
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,331
DON'T TRUST THAT WOMAN.

122
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,919
>> OKAY.

123
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,322
>> OKAY.

124
00:03:59,405 --> 00:03:59,614
TREEMAIL!

125
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,493
>> OH, BOY, HERE WE GO.

126
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,410
"THE STRONG MUST BEAR THE WEAK

127
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,121
IF YOU HOPE TO COMPETE.

128
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,331
THE TASTE OF VICTORY TODAY WILL

129
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,708
BE, OH, SO SWEET."

130
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,126
>> IT MENTIONS THE WEAK SO THERE

131
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,503
IS A PLACE FOR ME IN THIS

132
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:13,753
CHALLENGE.

133
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,506
THE TREEMAIL DID SAY THE STRONG

134
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,174
WILL CARRY THE WEEK.

135
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,634
WE HAVE PLENTY OF THE LATTER

136
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,802
CATEGORY SO IF THE SUCCESS OF

137
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,262
THIS CHALLENGE DEPENDS ON THE

138
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,097
EXISTENCE OF WEAK PEOPLE WE GOT

139
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,263
IT.

140
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,807
>> ANYTHING WITH STRENGTH IS A

141
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,599
LITTLE WORRISOME.

142
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,768
>> ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE UPPER

143
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:34,565
BODY, UPPER BACK SHOULDERS--

144
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,192
WITHOUT BEING ARROGANT-- I'M

145
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,151
ALMOST CERTAIN I CAN WIN IT.

146
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,736
>> TREEMAIL SAYS YOU HAVE TO BE

147
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,862
STRONG IN THE CHALLENGE.

148
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,530
WE'RE ALL LOOKING AROUND LIKE,

149
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,615
"WELL, THAT SUCKS."

150
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,491
AND PHILLIP WITH HIS BRAVADO IS

151
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,868
"I GOT THIS, WHAT ARE YOU

152
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,452
TALKING ABOUT?

153
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,621
I'M THE STRONGEST GUY OUT HERE."

154
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,288
OH, MY GOD.

155
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,540
>> I ONLY DO WHAT YOU CALL POWER

156
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:50,748
LIFTING.

157
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:54,293
I DON'T BLOW UP LIKE MUSCLE BODY

158
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,170
BUILDERS AND IT'S DECENTIVE

159
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,213
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GRAB SOMEONE

160
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,632
YOU CAN GENERALLY PULL THEM OR

161
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,927
HOLD THEM A LOT LONGER BUT YOU

162
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,388
DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU CAN.

163
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:10,435
THIS CHALLENGE HAS SOMETHING TO

164
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,894
DO WITH STRENGTH AND I THINK FOR

165
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,021
A LOT OF THEM THEY'RE CONCERNED

166
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:13,271
ABOUT IT.

167
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:13,896
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE

168
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,481
BUT I BELIEVE AS A PERSON AND A

169
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,816
MAN NOBODY IN THE OTHER TRIBE

170
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,525
CAN BEAT ME ARM WRESTLING.

171
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,277
I BEAT MOST MEN.

172
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,698
I LOVE TO FIND A SUCKER SOME GUY

173
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,991
WITH GREAT BIG MUSCLES WHO LOOKS

174
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,993
AT ME AND THINKS HE CAN BEAT ME.

175
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,453
SO PART OF MY TECHNIQUE WHEN I

176
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,537
GO IS TO GET THE GUY COME THAT

177
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:29,704
WAY.

178
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:35,084
THEN I TURN THAT WRIST LIKE THAT

179
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:35,543
DOWN LIKE THAT.

180
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,502
>> PHILLIP CHALLENGED ME TO AN

181
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,462
ARM WRESTLING MATCH.

182
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:43,009
HE NATURALLY WAS ABLE TO BEAT ME

183
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:43,259
QUICKLY.

184
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,011
>> PUT BOTH HANDS ON IT.

185
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,219
READY?

186
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,055
PUT MY HAND DOWN.

187
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,057
PUT ALL YOUR WEIGHT ON IT, MAN!

188
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,266

00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,494
>> GUYS, THEY'RE COMING.

377
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,912
>> Jeff: BIKAL DOESN'T EVEN

378
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,537
SEEM CONCERNED.

379
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,455
>> LET'S GO!

380
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,915
>> YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!

381
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,459
>> Jeff: GOTA CAN SENSE THE

382
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:08,668
KILL.

383
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,544
COCHRAN AND JULIA ARE OUT.

384
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,088
CORRINE WITH 60 POUNDS.

385
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,048
ANDREA GOES DOWN FOR GOTA.

386
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,635
>> RUN!

387
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,637
>> Jeff: PHILLIP FALLS DOWN!

388
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,930
THIS IS IT!

389
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,016
>> GO, GET HIM.

390
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,935
>> Jeff: IT'S OVER!

391
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,937
GOTA WINS REWARD!

392
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,896
>> THAT WAS THE WORST STRATEGY

393
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:29,939
EVER!

394
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,274
>> BRILLIANT STRATEGY.

395
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:32,983
PERFECT EXECUTION.

396
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,860
ALL DAY, EVERY TIME.

397
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,196
>> COOKIES AND BROWNIES!

398
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,198
COOKIES AND BROWNIES!

399
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,493
>> Jeff: GOTA,

400
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:42,868
CONGRATULATIONS.

401
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:43,119
NICE WIN.

402
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,453
NICE REWARD.

403
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,996
YOU'LL BE TAKEN TO ANOTHER

404
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,665
ISLAND, THE COFFEE BAR WILL BE

405
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,249
SET UP.

406
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:48,874
ENJOY THE AFTERNOON.

407
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,042
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.

408
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,127
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

409
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:51,585
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

410
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,837
>> THEY'RE GOING TO GET SICK.

411
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,464
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

412
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:55,965
THAT'S DIARRHEA FEST.

413
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,800
>> Jeff: BIKAL, GOT NOTHING

414
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,384
FOR YOU.

415
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,970
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

416
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:01,178
CAMP.

417
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,430
>> PHILLIP HAS JUST PUT HIMSELF

418
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,848
IN THIS ROLE THAT HE'S THE

419
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,975
LEADER AND HE'S JUST EXTREMELY

420
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,644
-- GOSH, ARROGANT SOUNDS SO MEAN

421
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,770
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

422
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,689
HE SEES ALL OF HIS STRENGTHS AND

423
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,774
NONE OF HIS WEAKNESSES.

424
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:30,624
WELCOME!

425
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,335
(SCREAMING)

426
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,837
>> OH, MY GOD!

427
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,213
MUFFIN!

428
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:36,464
MUFFIN?

429
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,050
>> .

430
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,719
>> CAN I HAVE A BROWNIE?

431
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,305
>> THAT'S PERFECT!

432
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:44,972
>> WINNING THE REWARD WAS A

433
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,933
GREAT WAY TO BOND WITH THE FANS

434
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,935
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVEN'T WON

435
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,481
A REWARD YET.

436
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:53,689
CHEERS!

437
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,357
SO IT WAS NICE TO SEE THEM

438
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,276
ENJOYING A REWARD WITH US,

439
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:57,985
BONDING WITH THEM AS PEOPLE.

440
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:02,114
>> TO THE FIRST OF MANY REWARDS.

441
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,033
>> I WANT TO GET AS CLOSE TO

442
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,367
THEM AS POSSIBLE BEFORE, YOU

443
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:05,951
KNOW, I VOTE THEM OUT SO THEY

444
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,952
REMEMBER THE GOOD TIMES AND

445
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:17,630
STILL VOTE FOR ME IN THE END.

446
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,882
>> SPRING BREAK, NO PARENTS!

447
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,049
WHOO!

448
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:20,925
I JUST FEEL GREAT.

449
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:27,890
I MEAN, I'M A BACCAANALIAN, LIFE

450
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,143
IS MEANT TO INDULGE IN GLORIOUS

451
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:31,393
ABUNDANCE.

452
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,521
SO THIS REWARD IS RIGHT IN MY

453
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,230
SWEET SPOT.

454
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,356
NO PUN INTENDED.

455
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,190
(LAUGHS)

456
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,776
THIS ONE IS REALLY GOOD.

457
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,819
WINNING A REWARD LIKE THIS HELPS

458
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,904
TO SOLIDIFY BONDS BETWEEN PEOPLE

459
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:42,696
WITHIN A TRIBE.

460
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,572
>> I LOVE YOU.

461
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:43,989
>> I LOVE YOU!

462
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,325
>> AND I LOVE YOU.

463
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,868
>> AND ESPECIALLY MOST IMPORTANT

464
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,953
IS GETTING THESE BONDS GOING

465
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,954
WITH THE FAVORITES.

466
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,873
>> AND YOU.

467
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,999
MWAH.

468
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,376
CAFFEINE IS STARTING TO KICK IN!

469
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,460
>> CAN'T TELL.

470
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,379
>> WITH NEW GOTA EVERYONE ON THE

471
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:58,879
SURFACE IS JUST SMILING.

472
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,341
ALL WE DO IS WIN CHALLENGES AND

473
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:02,550
PARTY.

474
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,426
IT'S JUST ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY,

475
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:04,635
REALLY.

476
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,011
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A

477
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,555
GAME GOING ON AND WHEN IT COMES

478
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,557
DOWN TO IT I KNOW I'M GOING TO

479
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,308
BE IN TROUBLE WHEN IT COMES

480
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,726
MERGE TIME NO ONE WANTS TO GO TO

481
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,477
THE END WITH ME.

482
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,770
NOT THAT I BLAME THEM BUT I HAVE

483
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,438
TO MAKE MY MOVE SOON.

484
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,064
I'M KEEPING A SMILE BUT GETTING

485
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,149
MY PIECES READY TO TAKE CONTROL

486
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:19,483
OF THIS GAME.

487
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,026
>> SAEURBG ASLEEP WITH A SMILE

488
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,612
AND A COOKIE IN HIS HAND.

489
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,116
JUST HAPPY TO KNOW THAT IT'S

490
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,702
THERE.

491
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,161
(LAUGHTER)

492
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:34,915
>> ONCE THEY LINED UP IT WAS

493
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,293
CLEAR THEIR LEGS WERE GOING TO

494
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,794
OUTWALK US OR OUTRUN US.

495
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:39,253
JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

496
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,298
AND THEY HAD YOUTH SO THEY HAD

497
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,507
EVERY COMPONENT THEY NEEDED TO

498
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,633
WIN THAT CHALLENGE.

499
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,760
>> WE JUST LOST OUR REWARD

500
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,386
CHALLENGE AND I'M GOING TO BLAME

501
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,638
THE WHOLE THING ON PHILLIP AND

502
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,598
PHILLIP CAN TAKE THE FALL FOR

503
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:50,806
THIS.

504
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,933
>> THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO TRIBAL

505
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,144
TONIGHT SO -- WHAT?

506
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,605
>> OH, THIS IS A REWARD

507
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:57,855
CHALLENGE.

508
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,522
>> NO DOWN.

509
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,023
NO DOWN.

510
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,816
>> YOU TUB BILUNCHBOX!

511
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,026
I HAVE YET TO SEE AN AB ON YOU.

512
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,570
I DON'T SEE ANY PECTORAL

513
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:04,820
MUSCLES.

514
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:05,946
HE'S AN AMOEBA.

515
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,325
HE'S A LOOSE PEN POUNDS OF

516
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,327
POTATOES IN A FIVE-POUND SACK.

517
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,828
HE'S JUST A MESS.

518
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,622
BUT EVERYONE ELSE SEES HIS TRUE

519
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,664
COLORS AND HE BLOWS THE NEXT

520
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,749
CHALLENGE FOR US MAYBE WE TAKE

521
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,207
HIM OUT.

522
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,917
I COULD HAVE TAKEN EVERYBODY'S

523
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:19,501
WEIGHTS AND DONE THE ENTIRE

524
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,003
THING MYSELF AND WON IT.

525
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:26,258
HE'S THE WORST.

526
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,260
>> HE HAS THIS INFLATED SENSE OF

527
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,094
I'M THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE

528
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,180
WORLD, I'M MR. UNIVERSE

529
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,598
STKWHR-FPLT IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

530
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,265
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP PLAYING

531
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,310
THIS GAME WITH HIM.

532
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,144
>> YEAH.

533
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,145
PHILLIP AND CORRINE HATE EACH

534
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:38,646
OTHER.

535
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,897
THERE'S SO MUCH FRACTURE AND

536
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,023
DIVISION WITHIN THE FAVORITES ON

537
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,191
THIS TRIPE IT'S LIKE A DEATH

538
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:42,441
SENTENCE.

539
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,109
SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT

540
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:44,568
ONE POINT OR ANOTHER.

541
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,819
>> IT'S A JOKE.

542
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,445
>> I'M GOING TO BE PUSHING THAT

543
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:53,035
WE CERTAINLY VOTE OFF A FAN

544
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,411
WHICH IS NOT EVEN A CERTAINTY

545
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,871
BECAUSE MICHAEL HAS GOTTEN VERY,

546
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:56,914
VERY CLOSE WITH CORRINE.

547
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,998
>> IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF HOW

548
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,625
WE CAN REEL HIM IN, PLEASE LET

549
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,084
ME KNOW.

550
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,252
>> JULIA, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS

551
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,254
SUCH A NONENTITY OUT HERE.

552
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,215
I'M TEMPTED TO SAY SHE HAS A

553
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,466
VANILLA PERSONALITY BUT I FEEL

554
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,133
LIKE THAT WOULD BE DOING A GREAT

555
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,928
DISSERVICE TO THE FLAVOR

556
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,178
VANILLA.

557
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,096
PEOPLE ACTIVELY SEEK OUT

558
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,055
VANILLA-FLAVORED PRODUCTS.

559
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,140
CHILDREN CLAMOR TO GET VANILLA

560
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,892
ICE CREAM CONE.

561
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,978
NOBODY IS CLAMORING FOR ANYTHING

562
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:20,354
JULIA-FLAVORED.

563
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,105
EXCEPT FOR PHILLIP.

564
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,439
PHILLIP HAS GROWN VERY, VERY

565
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,857
CLOSE TO JULIA.

566
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,526
AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY.

567
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,070
>> IF YOU WERE TO SURVIVE AND

568
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,072
MAKE IT TO THE MERGE I'D WANT

569
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,116
YOU TO BE FRIEND WITH YOUR OTHER

570
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,242
TRIBE MATES, LEARN WHAT YOU

571
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,245
LEARN AND DON'T GO BACK.

572
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,121
MIGHT AS WELL BE A PART OF THE

573
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,415
WINNING STRATEGY AND SAY, HEY,

574
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:39,748
YOU KNOW WHAT?

575
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,207
I MADE A BIG MOVE.

576
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,168
THE PROBLEM WITH BEING A DOUBLE

577
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,254
AGENT IS-- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

578
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,256
EFFECTIVELY YOU BECOME-- I'D

579
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,675
LIKE TO MAKE YOU ONE OF THE

580
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:49,883
BEST.

581
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:50,259
>> UNDERSTOOD.

582
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,094
>> DON'T SHARE IT WITH ANYONE

583
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,178
ELSE, INCLUDING ANY MEMBER OF

584
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,140
OUR TRIBE.

585
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,850
I THINK I'VE DONE A VERY GOOD

586
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,143
JOB WITH JULIA AND I THINK I'VE

587
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,854
GOT MY FIRST DOUBLE AGENT.

588
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,312
I SHARE WITH HER SOME

589
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,064
INFORMATION AND I TOLD HER DON'T

590
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,107
SHARE IT WITH ANYONE ELSE.

591
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,234
IF SHE FEELS SHE'S IN TROUBLE

592
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,028
SHE CAN LET ME KNOW AND I'LL DO

593
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:09,611
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE

594
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,530
SURE SHE STAYS IN THE GAME.

595
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,451
I CAN'T SAY EXACTLY WHERE YOU

596
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:15,909
WOULD END.

597
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,201
>> YEAH?

598
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,286
>> BUT YOU COULD GO FAR.

599
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,746
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING WITH FILL

600
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,372
SLIP THAT I DON'T FIND HIM TO BE

601
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,124
AN INTIMIDATING CHARACTER AT

602
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:22,291
ALL.

603
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,167
BUT WHEN HE'S LIKELY TELL YOU TO

604
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,128
DO THIS AND YOU WILL DO IT.

605
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:26,754
I UNDERSTAND THAT AT THIS POINT

606
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,380
IF I HAVE ANY HOPE OF STAYING IN

607
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,507
THE GAME THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO

608
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:30,674
DO.

609
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,342
>> FULLY UNDERSTOOD.

610
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,969
BUT IT COMES A POINT WHEN HE'S

611
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,596
GOING TO REALLY DESTRUCT THE

612
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,640
UNITY OF THE TRIBE BY DRIVING

613
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,683
EVERYONE CRAZY SO WHY NOT GET

614
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,271
RID OF HIM?

615
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,829
>> SO WE HAVE SEVEN HERE, THEY

616
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,121
HAVE SIX.

617
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:06,627
>> THEY HAVE SIX.

618
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,587
IMMUNITY TOMORROW.

619
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,129
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

620
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,799
>> WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME

621
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,175
PROBLEM, IT'S EASY TO BRING THEM

622
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:13,425
TOGETHER.

623
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,594
AND THE FOUR ALPHA MALES IN THIS

624
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,304
GAME-- BEING MYSELF, REYNOLD,

625
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,223
EDDIE AND ERIC-- ARE GOING TO

626
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,682
HAVE A BIG PROBLEM COME MERGE

627
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:20,849
TIME.

628
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,309
THE ATHLETIC GUYS ARE GOING TO

629
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,977
GET TARGETED AND KNOCKED OUT OF

630
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,229
THE GAME.

631
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,397
WHAT I NEED TO DO IS SPEARHEAD

632
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,900
HAVING THESE FOUR GUYS JOIN

633
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,150
FORCES.

634
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,568
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STICK

635
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,361
TOGETHER GOING INTO THE MERGE.

636
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,987
THE FOUR OF US, THE GUYS, ARE

637
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,697
GOING TO BE THE FIRST FOUR

638
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:35,906
TARGETS.

639
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:36,490
WE KNOW THAT.

640
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,367
IT'S GOT TO BE THE FOUR GUYS.

641
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,409
I'LL BRING IN ERIC AND YOU HAVE

642
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,744
TO BRING IN EDDIE.

643
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,623
>> EDDIE AND ARE 100% FULL

644
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,208
DISCLOSURE EACH-TO-EACH OTHER

645
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:46,708
TIGHT HONEST.

646
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,252
AND I AM FULLY ON THE PAGE WITH

647
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:48,460
THAT.

648
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,045
UP TO THIS POINT, I'VE BEEN LIED

649
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,338
TO A LOT BY MY PREVIOUS TRIBE SO

650
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,674
AT THIS POINT THE ONLY PERSON I

651
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,675
BELIEVE IS EDDIE.

652
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:55,759
I BELIEVE YOU.

653
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,718
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE

654
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,636
TALKING TO ME RIGHT NOW.

655
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,764
>> WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT.

656
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,390
>> IN A GAME WHERE YOU CAN NOT

657
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,475
TRUST ANYBODY IT'S HARD TO TELL.

658
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,144
YOU STILL HAVE TO KIND OF RELY

659
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,311
ON YOUR INSTINCTS.

660
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,521
>> WE'RE THE SAME CHARACTER.

661
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,981
>> THE EXACT SAME PERSON.

662
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,440
>> AND MALCOLM JUST STRIKES ME

663
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,526
AS THE TYPE OF GUY THAT IS LIKE

664
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,360
ME AND HE SEES THAT I CAN HELP

665
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,696
HIM AND HE CAN DEFINITELY HELP

666
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:15,863
ME.

667
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,739
SO THIS ONE FEELS RIGHT AND THIS

668
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,074
WILL BE THE ONE THAT IS THE NAIL

669
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,243
IN THE COFFIN FOR ME IF I'M

670
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:21,410
WRONG.

671
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,370
WOULD THEY TELL YOU IF THEY WERE

672
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:23,704
GOING FOR ME?

673
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,330
>> YEAH, BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M

674
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,374
ON BOARD AND IF IT IS, LIKE,

675
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,000
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

676
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:28,417
>> WILL YOU TELL ME?

677
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,378
>> YEAH, I WILL.

678
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,504
IF YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF I'LL

679
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,046
TELL YOU.

680
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,463
>> I HAVE THE IDOL.

681
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,340
>> I WILL DEFINITELY TELL YOU.

682
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,842
>> DON'T MENTION ABOUT THE IDOL.

683
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,593
>> ALL RIGHT, SICK.

684
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,344
>> IF I DIDN'T COMPLETELY TRUST

685
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,220
REYNOLD AFTER SELLING HIM ON

686
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,264
THIS IDEA, I TRUST HIM NOW

687
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,433
BECAUSE HE'S GONE SO OVER THE

688
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,267
TOP UNNECESSARILY TO PROVE HIS

689
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,520
LOYAL THEY HE'S TOLD ME ABOUT

690
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,521
HIS IDOL.

691
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,273
I'VE HAD AN IDOL SINCE DAY FOUR.

692
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,150
I WOULDN'T OFFER TO DO THAT FOR

693
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:53,775
SOME STRANGER WHO JUST CAME TO

694
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,485
ME SO WITH THIS INFORMATION I'M

695
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,778
THE ONLY ONE IN THE GAME WHO

696
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,572
KNOWS WHERE BOTH IDOLS ARE AND I

697
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,073
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON

698
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:00,699
SOME PEOPLE'S FACES WHEN I TAKE

699
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,743
CONTROL OF THIS GAME.

700
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,327
GOD, I CAN'T WAIT!

701
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,204
(LAUGHS)

702
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,592
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

703
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:23,055
THINKING NEXT STAGE IN THE GAME.

704
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,306
>> OBVIOUSLY WHATEVER YOUR

705
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,933
DYNAMIC IS WITH PHIL THAT'S YOUR

706
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:26,183
BUSINESS.

707
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,392
THE THING IS THAT I TALKED WITH

708
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,519
PHIL AND HE GAVE ME THE SENSE

709
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,270
THAT MAYBE HE WOULD WANT TO TAKE

710
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,856
ME ALONG FOR NEIGHBOR A NEW

711
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,690
ALLIANCE HE WANTS TO DO AFTER

712
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,316
THE MERGE.

713
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,527
SO PART OF ME FELT A LITTLE

714
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,071
INDEBTED TO HIM BUT I FEEL LIKE

715
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,406
I'M BEING BULLIED.

716
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,200
>> I THINK HE'S TRYING TO BRING

717
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:43,450
YOU IN.

718
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,326
>> LIKE HE'S PLAYING HIS GAME --

719
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,036
>> FOR HIM.

720
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,246
>> AT THIS POINT IT'S WORKING

721
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,373
FOR ME, TOO.

722
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,583
>> JULIA APPROACHED ME AND JUST

723
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,627
SAID "PHILLIP REALLY WANTS ME TO

724
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,544
WORK WITH HIM.

725
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,671
I'M OKAY WORKING UNDER HIM IF

726
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,339
THAT KEEPS ME IN THE GAME."

727
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,340
>> WHAT IF EVERYONE JUST

728
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,758
OVERTHREW PHIL.

729
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,842
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT I

730
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,719
WANT TO DO BUT WHAT'S STOPPING

731
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:02,970
PEOPLE?

732
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,763
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE DYNAMIC

733
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,055
IS.

734
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,473
BASED ON THE TIME I'VE SPENT

735
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,307
WITH JULIA SHE WASN'T SEEMS VERY

736
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,726
AWARE OF THE GAME SO IT'S

737
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,019
HELPFUL TO KNOW SHE'S THINKING

738
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,646
MORE THAN WE THOUGHT SHE WAS.

739
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,189
JUST SO YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING

740
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:17,275
TO SAY A SINGLE THING TO

741
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,526
ANYBODY.

742
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,529
>> OH, OH, OH!

743
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,906
JULIA APPROACHED ME AND SHE'S

744
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,532
LIKE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ME IF

745
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,284
I WORK WITH PHILLIP IT FEELS

746
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,494
LIKE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING

747
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,161
FOR ME LONG TERM.

748
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,663
>> SHE'S AN IDIOT.

749
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,956
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HER NOT TO

750
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,623
SAY THAT TO ANYONE.

751
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,791
>> THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU.

752
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,418
>> WHAT AN IDIOT.

753
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,419
JULIA, ORIGINALLY I WANTED HER

754
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:35,627
HERE.

755
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,712
I DID.

756
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,423
BUT SHE'S MANAGED TO COMMIT

757
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,383
SEVERAL FAUX PAS IN TERMS OF

758
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,300
"SURVIVOR" PLAY.

759
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,760
>> SHE NEEDS TO GO.

760
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,762
>> OH, YEAH, I'VE ALREADY

761
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,014
CONCLUDED THAT.

762
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,098
I GAVE HER A PIECE OF

763
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,599
INFORMATION AND I SAID "YOU'RE

764
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,227
NOT GO-TO-GO TO ANYONE ELSE FOR

765
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,561
VALIDATION."

766
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,145
OF COURSE SHE WENT TO DAWN AND

767
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,771
DAWN, OF COURSE, CAME TO ME AND

768
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,772
TOLD ME THAT AND JULIA WON'T

769
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,940
KNOW UNTIL SHE'S WALKING DOWN

770
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:04,239
THAT AISLE WITH HER TORCH OUT.

771
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:21,006
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,373
>> Jeff: REYNOLD WITH THE

936
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:05,915
FIFTH KEY RIGHT IN SIGHT.

937
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,336
THIS COULD DO IT FOR GOTA.

938
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,338
PHILLIP STILL LOOKING FOR TWO

939
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,213
FINAL KEYS.

940
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:12,922
HE'S RIGHT ON IT.

941
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,716
CAN HE MAKE IT WORK?

942
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,595
JUST MISSES.

943
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,764
REYNOLD HAS THAT FIFTH KEY.

944
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,848
>> NICE!

945
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,060
>> Jeff: BIKAL NEEDS TO GET

946
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,728
MOVING.

947
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,188
REYNOLD AND ANDREA GOING TO TRY

948
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,106
TO OPEN THAT LOCK FOR GO.

949
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,194
A PHILLIP AGAIN JUST MISSES.

950
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,403
ANDREA HAS IT FOR GOTA.

951
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,863
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO NOW IS PULL

952
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,322
THAT ROPE.

953
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,617
>> ONE, TWO, THREE!

954
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,243
>> Jeff: THIS WILL DO IT.

955
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,828
GOTA WINS IMMUNITY!

956
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:51,878
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

957
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,797
GOTA, CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN!

958
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,842
(APPLAUSE)

959
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,969
ALL RIGHT, GOTA, ENJOY THE NIGHT

960
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:00,136
OFF.

961
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,721
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

962
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,390
CAMP.

963
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,141
BIKAL, AFTER 19 DAYS, ONE OF YOU

964
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,519
WILL BE THE EIGHTH PERSON TO

965
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,228
LEAVE THIS GAME.

966
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:08,812
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

967
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,939
CAMP, SEE THE YOU TONIGHT AT

968
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,024
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

969
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,041
>> THOSE THINGS WOULD BE A LOT

970
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,042
OF FUN IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE SO

971
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:31,960
MUCH RIDING ON THEM.

972
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:32,877
>> YEAH, THEY WOULD.

973
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,587
>> THE GRAPPLING IS HARDER THAN

974
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:34,838
IT LOOKS.

975
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:35,797
>> YEAH.

976
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,841
>> SO WHEN WE GOT BACK TO CAMP

977
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,300
SPIRITS WERE UNDERSTANDABLY A

978
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,010
LITTLE BIT LOW.

979
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,512
WE JUST LOST.

980
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,472
AND PHILLIP WAS SULKING AROUND

981
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,018
EYEING OUT EVERYBODY AND THEN HE

982
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:49,853
QUICKLY AND COVERTLY PULLED ME

983
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,605
ASIDE AND WHISPERED INTENSELY --

984
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,106
>> I HAVE A CONFESSION.

985
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,775
>> AND MY MIND STARTS RACING

986
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,025
INSTANTLY.

987
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,485
HAS HE DONE SOMETHING AROUND

988
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:57,652
CAMP.

989
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,612
IS HE GOING TO BETRAY CORRINE

990
00:28:59,696 --> 00:28:59,821
TONIGHT?

991
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,698
WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE?

992
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,658
>> I LOVE WHAT JEFF HAD IN STORE

993
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:05,076
FOR US TODAY FOR THE CHALLENGE.

994
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,827
IT WAS AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

995
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,580
WE WERE CLOSE IN THE CHALLENGE,

996
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,874
PROBABLY COULD HAVE WON THAT

997
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,459
CHALLENGE-- HAD I WANTED TO.

998
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,085
I DIDN'T WANT TO WIN THAT

999
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:14,335
CHALLENGE.

1000
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:14,669
>> (LAUGHS)

1001
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,212
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING SAY THAT.

1002
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,505
>> OKAY?

1003
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,883
I COULDN'T SEE JULIE AT THE

1004
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,091
MERGE.

1005
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:20,842
>> IT ALL MAKES SENSE!

1006
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,011
WE HAD TO THROW THE CHALLENGE IN

1007
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,845
ORDER TO GET RID OF ONE OF THESE

1008
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,222
FANS OR ELSE WE WERE DOOMED.

1009
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:26,973
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY

1010
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,476
PHILLIP WAS UNABLE TO

1011
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,644
SUCCESSFULLY THROW A GRAPPLING

1012
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:31,853
HOOK.

1013
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,854
I MEAN, IT'S COMPLETE CRAP.

1014
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:37,025
>> IT HIT ME ONCE I SAW IT WAS A

1015
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:37,984
GRAPPLING HOOK, I'LL MAKE A

1016
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,612
GALLANT EFFORT BUT IT WON'T BE

1017
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,196
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE BECAUSE I

1018
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,573
WOULD HAVE TOSSED IT SLIGHTLY

1019
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:43,865
DIFFERENTLY.

1020
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,492
>> YOU CAN'T MAKE UP THIS LEVEL

1021
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,034
OF DELUSION AND THAT'S WHAT

1022
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,119
EXCITES ME ABOUT PLAYING WITH

1023
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:48,369
PHILLIP.

1024
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,829
I THINK HE'S CONVINCED HE THREW

1025
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,289
THE CHALLENGE.

1026
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,332
SOME OF THE RAZZLE DAZZLE.

1027
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,917
>> SLOWING IT DOWN, PULLING IT

1028
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,125
BACK.

1029
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:54,876
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HUSTLING TO

1030
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,503
GET IT BACK.

1031
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,087
>> HE WASN'T THROWING THE

1032
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,506
CHALLENGE, HE WAS TRYING HIS

1033
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,299
HARDEST, HE WAS IN FULL SPY

1034
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:01,508
MODE.

1035
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,091
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SPEECH HE

1036
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,011
WOULD HAVE GIVEN AT CAMP HAD HE

1037
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,846
SUCCESSFULLY THROWN A GRAPPLING

1038
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,098
HOOK, THE SPY'S BASIC TOOL, AT A

1039
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:09,724
CHALLENGE AND WON THE CHALLENGE

1040
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:09,974
FOR US?

1041
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,393
IT'S JUST -- (LAUGHS)

1042
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,563
IT'S ABSURD!

1043
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,440
>> WHEN A LION, THE MALE LION

1044
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,317
WITH HIS MANE WHEN HE COMESES

1045
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,069
ACROSS ANOTHER PRIDE OF LIONS OF

1046
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,529
FEMALES AND THERE'S CUBS AND THE

1047
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,614
MALE ISN'T AROUND, WHAT DOES HE

1048
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:24,781
DO?

1049
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,407
HE KILLS ALL THE CUBS.

1050
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:26,991
>> (LAUGHS)

1051
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:27,951
>> YOU KNOW WHY?

1052
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,869
THOSE ARE POTENTIAL RIVALS.

1053
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,246
SO TODAY --

1054
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,372
>> TAKING OUT THE CUBS.

1055
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,915
>> TAKING OUT THE CUBS.

1056
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,583
>> WE'RE STILL ON BOARD WITH

1057
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:35,917
SLITTING, RIGHT?

1058
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,168
>> WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT BECAUSE

1059
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,586
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T

1060
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,212
HAVE THE IDOL.

1061
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:39,879
>> THE NUMBERS ARE FOUR

1062
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,006
FAVORITES AND TWO FANS.

1063
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,007
THAT NUMBERS ADVANTAGE MEANS

1064
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,301
THAT THE FOUR OF US CAN SPLIT

1065
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,053
OUR VOTES ACROSS THE TWO

1066
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,972
REMAINING FANS, FLUSH OUT ANY

1067
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,890
POSSIBLE IDOLS AND AND WE CAN

1068
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,352
GET RID OF JULIA.

1069
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,437
>I STILL THINK

1070
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,855
WE SHOULD SPLIT THE VOTES.

1071
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,815
>> I'M NOT SPLITTING.

1072
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,774
>> I THINK WE SHOULD.

1073
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:00,275
>> THERE'S NO REASON.

1074
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:00,984
>> IT'S COMMON SENSE.

1075
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,777
WHY NOT?

1076
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,320
IF WE HAVE THE NUMBERS WHY NOT

1077
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:04,737
DO IT.

1078
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,238
>> WHY ARE YOU WORRIED?

1079
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,115
>> BECAUSE AS SOON AS WE MERGE I

1080
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,200
WANT MIKE TO WORK WITH US LONG

1081
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,285
TERM SO I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING

1082
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:10,952
IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE HE

1083
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,371
FEELS SAFE, COMFORTABLE, AND

1084
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,331
TRUSTS US.

1085
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,457
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF

1086
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,083
SPLITTING VOTES BECAUSE TO ME I

1087
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,460
KNOW I WANT TO SEND JULIA HOME,

1088
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,962
I KNOW THERE'S NO IDOL BECAUSE I

1089
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,338
HAVE THE IDOL WITH MALCOLM AND I

1090
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,882
DON'T WANT TO GO INTO A MERGE

1091
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,466
HAVING MICHAEL SECOND GUESSING

1092
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,801
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1093
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:27,844
IT'S BAD BUSINESS.

1094
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:28,678
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAN'T

1095
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,721
CONVINCE THE REST OF THE

1096
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,138
ALLIANCE OF THAT.

1097
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,433
>> I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT HOW HE

1098
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,017
FEELS ABOUT IT.

1099
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,351
I HAVE THE NUMBERS WITHOUT HIM.

1100
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,227
I DON'T NEED HIM.

1101
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:36,769
>> SHH!

1102
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,646
>> I'M JUST SAYING I DON'T NEED

1103
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,523
HIM SO WHY SHOULD BY EXTRA --

1104
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,774
>> WE DO NEED HIM.

1105
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,026
>> YOU DON'T NEED HIM.

1106
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,068
>> YOU MIGHT.

1107
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,153
>> WE MIGHT BUT WE MIGHT NOT.

1108
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,614
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT THEM ALL IN

1109
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,239
ONE BASKET.

1110
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,907
THAT'S THE WAY I PLAY THE GAME.

1111
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,199
>> I GET IT.

1112
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,451
DON'T WALK AWAY.

1113
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,785
>> I PLAYED WITH BOSTON ROB.

1114
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,455
>> OKAY, PHILLIP, THAT'S FINE.

1115
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,039
DON'T YELL AT ME.

1116
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,915
>> I'M NOT YELLING AT YOU!

1117
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,458
>> YOU ARE.

1118
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,042
>> NO, I'M NOT SAYING WHAT YOU

1119
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,501
WANT ME TO HEAR.

1120
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,462
>> CORRINE, WHO'S IN LOVE WITH

1121
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,379
MICHAEL, SEEMS TO HAVE THIS

1122
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,130
NOTION THAT OH, NO, NO, NO, IT

1123
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,507
HAS TO BE A SHOW OF UNITY.

1124
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,925
JUST A MOMENT HIM THINKING THAT

1125
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,010
WE ARE NOT 100% BEHIND HIM.

1126
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,054
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

1127
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,806
I DO SEE IT AND I SEE HER

1128
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,807
PUTTING HER SELFISH INTERESTS

1129
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,352
ABOVE THE FAVORITES.

1130
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:17,977
THE FOUR ALLIANCE THAT'S ON THE

1131
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,438
BEACH RIGHT NOW IS THE THREE OF

1132
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,356
US, NOT CORRINE.

1133
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,316
I'M NOT GOING TO BE BULLIED IN

1134
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,025
DOING SOMETHING I AT MY CORE

1135
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,985
SAYS YOU DON'T DO TO SATISFY HER

1136
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,695
NEW FRIEND.

1137
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,530
I PLAYED WITH THE SMARTEST

1138
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,114
PLAYER THAT I'VE EVER HAD AN

1139
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,492
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH, BOSTON

1140
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:32,659
ROB.

1141
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,327
AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT B.R.

1142
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,119
WOULD DO IN THIS SITUATION.

1143
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,164
WHAT B.R. WOULD DO IS SAY OKAY,

1144
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,874
CORRINE, WE VOTE MICHAEL OUT THE

1145
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:40,041
GAME.

1146
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,542
I'M GOING TO CAST MY VOTE ON

1147
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:41,751
MICHAEL.

1148
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,961
HE'S SMART, HE'S CLEVER, HE'S

1149
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,004
DOING IT BY THE BOOK, EXACTLY

1150
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,131
WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO DO TO STAY

1151
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,883
IN THE GAME.

1152
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:49,300
>> WHAT'D WE DECIDE.

1153
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,594
>> YOU MADE IT CLEAR FROM THE

1154
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,720
GET-GO WHO YOUR CHOICE WAS.

1155
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,304
I TOOK ALL EMOTION OUT OF IT.

1156
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,889
>> PHILLIP --

1157
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,057
>> I'M EXPLAINING --

1158
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,975
>> YOU'RE NOT LETTING ME TALK AT

1159
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:58,142
ALL.

1160
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,727
>> BECAUSE YOU WALKED UP ON A

1161
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,853
CONVERSATION I WAS HAVING WITH

1162
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,396
THE THREE OF THEM.

1163
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,272
>> WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE,

1164
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:03,523
PHILLIP.

1165
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,148
>> SO WHAT?

1166
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,400
>> I DON'T INTERRUPT YOU WHEN

1167
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,651
YOU HAVE A MEETING.

1168
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,276
WHEN YOU WALK OVER WITH DAWN DO

1169
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,529
I WALK OVER AND GO BLAH?

1170
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,571
I DON'T.

1171
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,906
I LET YOU FINISH YOUR

1172
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:12,240
CONVERSATION.

1173
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,950
>> YOU'RE BEING SO MEAN TO ME

1174
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,200
PHILLIP.

1175
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:14,659
>> I'M NOT BEING MEAN.

1176
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,660
>> YES, YOU ARE.

1177
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,911
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

1178
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:17,495
IF YOU'RE FEELING THAT WAY LET

1179
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,037
ME CONTINUE WITH THE

1180
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,164
CONVERSATION I WAS HAVING WITH

1181
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,374
ME, THANK YOU.

1182
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:21,708
APPRECIATE IT.

1183
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,085
>> PHILLIP IS BEYOND AWFUL.

1184
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,628
LIKE, IF THIS WAS THE REAL WORLD

1185
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,046
I WOULD KICK HIS ASS BUT FOR ME

1186
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,174
IT'S A WAITING GAME UNTIL I GET

1187
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,093
TO HOLD UP THAT PARCHMENT AND GO

1188
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,386
THIS IS WHAT BOSTON ROB WOULD

1189
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:33,803
HAVE DONE.

1190
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,179
>> LIKE, I'M NOT STUPID.

1191
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:35,763
>> OKAY.

1192
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,056
>> I AM VERY, VERY CONCERNED

1193
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,224
ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

1194
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,934
SHE WAS NEVER PART OF THE CORE

1195
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:40,184
ALLIANCE.

1196
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:40,476
>> AGREED.

1197
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,020
>> I SENSE HER LOVE FOR HIM IS

1198
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:43,938
GREATER THAN IT IS FOR ME.

1199
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,230
>> RIGHT.

1200
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,189
>> THAT'S A PROBLEM.

1201
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:45,606
>> RIGHT, AGREED.

1202
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,275
>> PHILLIP WANTS TO VOTE OFF

1203
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:47,483
MICHAEL.

1204
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,193
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE PLAN

1205
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,028
SET IN STONE BUT IT'S CLEARLY

1206
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,239
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JULIA OR

1207
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:53,573
MICHAEL.

1208
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,615
IT'S MASKING SOMETHING THAT'S

1209
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,118
ABOUT TO COME TO THE SURFACE AND

1210
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,161
TONIGHT'S VOTE WILL PROBABLY BE

1211
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,788
WHAT SETS INTO MOTION A SERIES

1212
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,040
OF EVENTS THAT COMPLETELY BRING

1213
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,584
THIS PHILLIP/CORRINE FEUD TO THE

1214
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,044
SURFACE AND MAKE IT CLEAR WHY

1215
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:12,800
THEY CAN'T PLAY TOGETHER.

1216
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,987
>> Jeff: SO MICHAEL, 19 DAYS

1217
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,656
IN, THIS TRIBE IN A STATE OF

1218
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:35,865
DESPAIR.

1219
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,158
IS IT HARD TO KEEP MORALE UP?

1220
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,701
>> OF COURSE, YEAH.

1221
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,203
I MEAN MAYBE IT BRINGS OUT A

1222
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,621
LITTLE BIT OF TENSION IN THE

1223
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,582
TRIBE WHEN MORALE IS LOW.

1224
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,667
>> Jeff: YA JULIA, IF IT'S

1225
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,336
STILL FANS VERSUS FAVORITES YOU

1226
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,046
WOULD HAVE A REASON TO BE TENSE.

1227
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,756
WHY WOULD ANYONE ELSE BE TENSE?

1228
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,340
>> YOU KNOW, THE FAVORITES DO

1229
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,884
HAVE THE NUMBERS AND SO I KNOW

1230
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,844
THEY'RE THINKING WAY PAST THIS

1231
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,303
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1232
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,180
THEY HAVE THEIR GAMES AND THEIR

1233
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,015
ALLIANCES SO I TOTALLY SEE HOW

1234
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,559
THEY WOULD BE TENSE AS WELL.

1235
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,061
>> Jeff: CORRINE, NOW I'M

1236
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:05,728
CONNECTING THE DOTS.

1237
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,438
IS THE TENSION WITHIN THE FOUR

1238
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,232
FAVORITES COMING DOWN TO "DO WE

1239
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,358
KEEP MICHAEL OR DO WE KEEP

1240
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:10,566
JULIA"?

1241
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,193
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1242
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,028
GOING INTO A POSSIBLE MERGE IS A

1243
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:14,862
REALLY SERIOUS THING AND YOU

1244
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,364
DON'T WANT TO SCREWING IN UP

1245
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,534
HERE AND THEN REGRET IT DOWN THE

1246
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:19,867
LINE.

1247
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,369
>> I WANTED TO ADD, JEFF, IT'S

1248
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:26,666
ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS.

1249
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,291
SOMETIMES FOR CORRINE AND MYSELF

1250
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,377
WE MIGHT CLASH ON A POINT.

1251
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,253
WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE

1252
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,255
SAME THING BUT THE PROCESS ON

1253
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,006
HOW WE GO ABOUT GETTING THERE IS

1254
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:34,715
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

1255
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,258
>> Jeff: DAWN, HAVE YOU SEEN

1256
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,218
PHILLIP AND CORRINE AS THEY TRY

1257
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,678
TO WORK THROUGH A DECISION?

1258
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,178
>> SEEN IT, FELT IT.

1259
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,638
(LAUGHS)

1260
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,139
BEEN MANY BETWEEN IT.

1261
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:42,348
YEAH.

1262
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,432
BUT I THINK AN ALLIANCE LIKE

1263
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,810
THIS IS KIND OF ORGANIC, IN A

1264
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,102
WAY.

1265
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,270
I'VE LEARNED THAT IF WE ALL HAVE

1266
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,230
THE SAME GOAL AT THE END THE

1267
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,691
CONFLICT MAY BE OKAY IF WE STAY

1268
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:51,941
COMMITTED.

1269
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:52,483
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT

1270
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,026
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

1271
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,528
GREAT JOB ON THE FIRST HALF,

1272
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,279
FELL APART ON THE SECOND HALF.

1273
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,282
PHILLIP, YOU PUT YOURSELF IN

1274
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,283
THAT HERO ROLE AGAIN.

1275
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,242
>> NO, I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

1276
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,536
I SEE IT AS PUTTING MYSELF IN

1277
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,203
THE ROLE THAT EVERYONE HAD

1278
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,288
PREVIOUSLY SEEN ON THREE OTHER

1279
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,082
OCCASIONS WHERE I PREVAILED.

1280
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:08,916
>> Jeff: WHO LOST THIS

1281
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,917
CHALLENGE TODAY?

1282
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,335
>> I WOULD SAY I LOST THE

1283
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:11,586
PORTION.

1284
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,504
>> Jeff: THAT'S WHAT I'M

1285
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:13,838
TALKING ABOUT.

1286
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,464
THE GUY WHO SAYS "GIMME THE

1287
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,174
BALL" IS THE GUY SAYING "COUNT

1288
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:17,508
ON ME.

1289
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:17,633
".

1290
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,426
>> BUT I'M ALSO THE GUY WHO WHEN

1291
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,303
THE STATUE CAME UP OUT OF THE

1292
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,430
BOAT I PICKED IT UP BY MYSELF

1293
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,099
WHERE THE OTHER TEAM TOOK THREE

1294
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,434
MEN TO CARRY IT.

1295
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,810
MAYBE THAT TIRED ME OUT, I DON'T

1296
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,019
KNOW.

1297
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:28,769
ALL YOU CAN DO IS MAKE SURE THE

1298
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,063
NEXT DAY YOU PUT FORTH ANOTHER

1299
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,816
110%, THAT'S HOW WINNERS BECOME

1300
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,066
WINNERS.

1301
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,611
>> Jeff: SO MICHAEL, YOU LOSE

1302
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,778
ANOTHER IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, HERE

1303
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,530
WE ARE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1304
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,698
IT'S YOU OR JULIA.

1305
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,241
HOW DO YOU PITCH YOURSELF TO

1306
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,701
THESE FOUR ABOUT WHY THEY SHOULD

1307
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,201
KEEP YOU?

1308
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,163
>> WELL, I DIDN'T START TODAY, I

1309
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,539
STARTED WHEN I LANDED ON THE

1310
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:48,748
BEACH.

1311
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,416
AND I HAVEN'T STOPPED.

1312
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,709
I'VE JUST BEEN WORKING HARD

1313
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,169
TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY TO TRUST

1314
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,879
ME SO THAT THEY CAN KNOW THAT

1315
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,340
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MERGE THEY

1316
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,382
FEEL COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD

1317
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,509
WITH ME.

1318
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,802
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, CORRINE WAS

1319
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,386
VERY VOCAL LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL

1320
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,764
ABOUT SAYING "I LIKE TO PLAY

1321
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,390
WITH THE GAYS."

1322
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,351
SO COULD MICHAEL'S FRIENDSHIP

1323
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,186
WITH CORRINE WORK AGAINST HIM?

1324
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,355
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IF PEOPLE

1325
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,648
PERCEIVE MICHAEL AS BEING MORE

1326
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,482
CONNECTED TO CORRINE AND MORE

1327
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,442
LIKELY TO WANT TO WORK SOLELY

1328
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,318
WITH HER, I CAN SEE THAT WORKING

1329
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,527
AGAINST HIM.

1330
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,488
>> LOOK, THIS IS A LITTLE

1331
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,447
GROSSLY EXAGGERATED.

1332
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,199
LIKE, I'VE ONLY KNOWN HIM FOR A

1333
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,533
HANDFUL OF DAYS AND I THINK IT'S

1334
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,577
NEAT THAT HE'S GAY.

1335
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,579
BUT A TWOSOME ALLIANCE THIS DOES

1336
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,248
NOT MAKE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1337
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:30,748
>>

1338
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,999
>> Jeff: SO MICHAEL, WHAT'S

1339
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:32,708
GOING TO HAPPEN?

1340
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,043
>> I WANT TO GET TO THE VOTE.

1341
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:34,669
I WANTED TO GET TO THE VOTE AS

1342
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,295
SOON AS WE GOT BACK FROM THE

1343
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,546
CHALLENGE TODAY.

1344
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,298
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, A

1345
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,592
CAT HANGING ON TO A TREE FOR,

1346
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,301
LIKE, FOUR OR FIVE DAYS GOING

1347
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,513
LIKE OH, MY GOD, WHAT'S GOING TO

1348
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:45,721
HAPPEN?

1349
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,013
YOU KNOW?

1350
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,933
AND I'M READY TO FIND OUT.

1351
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,893
>> Jeff: JULIA, HOW ABOUT YOU?

1352
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,603
HOW COMFORTABLE ARE YOU THAT YOU

1353
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,729
WILL SURVIVE TONIGHT'S VOTE?

1354
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,438
>> YOU KNOW, I CAME INTO THIS

1355
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,565
GAME THINKING I WAS GOING TO

1356
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,943
PLAY IT ONE WAY AND THEN

1357
00:37:59,026 --> 00:37:59,777
CIRCUMSTANCES HAD ME PLAY IT

1358
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,195
ANOTHER WAY SO I WAS OUT OF THAT

1359
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,989
COMFORT ZONE AND TRYING TO

1360
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,239
IMPROVISE.

1361
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,949
I'M TRYING TO MAYBE START

1362
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,367
ANALYZING WHAT DID I DO RIGHT;

1363
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,702
WHAT DID I DO WRONG.

1364
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,286
BUT I THINK I MAY HAVE GOTTEN A

1365
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,871
LITTLE TOO COMFORTABLE AT SOME

1366
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,080
POINT.

1367
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:16,794
MAYBE THAT WILL HURT ME TONIGHT.

1368
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,297
>> Jeff: WELL, IT IS TIME TO

1369
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,797
VOTE.

1370
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:28,180
JULIA, YOU'RE UP.

1371
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,705
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1372
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:58,002
VOTES.

1373
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,920
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1374
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,505
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1375
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:08,179
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1376
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,889
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ

1377
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:10,765
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1378
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,475
THE PERSON WILL BE ASKED TO

1379
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,434
LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1380
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:13,726
IMMEDIATELY.

1381
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,062
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1382
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:22,443
FIRST VOTE, MICHAEL.

1383
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:26,697
JULIA.

1384
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,114
MICHAEL.

1385
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,827
JULIA.

1386
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,496
THREE VOTES MICHAEL; TWO VOTES

1387
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:33,704
JULIA.

1388
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,541
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1389
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:37,750
JULIA.

1390
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:44,090
WE HAVE A TIE.

1391
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,674
WE'RE GOING DO REVOTE.

1392
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,634
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

1393
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,469
MICHAEL AND JULIA, YOU WILL NOT

1394
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:48,636
VOTE.

1395
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,678
EVERYBODY ELSE, YOU CAN ONLY

00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,515

00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:30,010
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1399
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:30,553
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1400
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,762
DECISION IS FINAL.

1401
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,805
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1402
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,014
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1403
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,474

FAVORITES, JULIA.

00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:51,615
>> BYE SWEETIE.

1412
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,909
>> THAT'S THREE, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1413
00:40:53,993 --> 00:41:02,168
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1414
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:06,797
JULIA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1415
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,382
>> IT'S BEEN FUN.

1416
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:09,008
GOOD LUCK.

1417
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:18,350
>> BYE, HONEY.

1418
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,102
>> Jeff: WELL, MICHAEL,

1419
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:20,936
WRITING'S ON THE WALL.

1420
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,562
YOU HAVE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT

1421
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,605
FOR YOU.

1422
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,274

1423
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,567
>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR TORCHES,

1424
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,527

FIELD.

1436
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,174
>> NOW THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL

1437
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:50,382
GAME.

1438
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,300
I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT EVERYBODY.

1439
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:51,717
>> WELCOME ABOARD.

1440
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,593
>> Jeff: AND EVERYONE IS

1441
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,678
SURPRISED BY AN UNEXPECTED

1442
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:54,887
FEAST.

1443
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,723
>> IT'S A FOOD-EATING

1444
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,015
COMPETITION.

1445
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,726
>> YUCK!

1446
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:00,976
(GAGGING)

1447
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,895
>> OH, GOD.

1448
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,444
>> THIS GAME WAS SO DIFFERENT

1449
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:11,987
THAN I EXPECTED GOING INTO IT.

1450
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,864
IT WAS TOUGH TO GO UP AGAINST A

1451
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,241
VETERAN PLAYER, PEOPLE WHO KNEW

1452
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,909
THE GAME INSIDE AND OUT AND WHO

1453
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:17,660
PLAYED BEFORE AND BE AT THEIR

1454
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,702
MERCY.

1455
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,246
THAT'S ONE OF THE WORST FEELINGS

1456
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,664
AT THIS GAME IS BEING AT THE

1457
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,831
MERCY OF OTHER PEOPLE.

1458
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,749
BUT I'VE HAD A WONDERFUL

1459
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,167
EXPERIENCE ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN

1460
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:25,876
INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING AT TIMES

1461
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,460
AND I COULD HAVEN'T DON
