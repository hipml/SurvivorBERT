1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,419
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,212
"SURVIVOR": SINCE DAY ONE, COACH

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,464
HAS BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,758
BEHIND AN IMPENETRABLE ALLIANCE

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,300
OF FIVE.

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,261
WE'VE GOT RICK, BRANDON,

7
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,595
SOPHIE, ALBERT, AND YOU'VE GOT

8
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,263
MYSELF.

9
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,097
Jeff: AND HE ADDED EDNA AS

10
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,681
THE SIXTH.

11
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,725
I CAN'T LIE TO ANYBODY

12
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:17,392
ANYMORE.

13
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,435
Jeff: BUT BRANDON SHATTERED

14
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,103
ANY ILLUSIONS EDNA HAD ABOUT

15
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,271
MOVING UP IN THE PECKING ORDER.

16
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,273
BRANDON SAID THE OTHER FIVE

17
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,649
PEOPLE IN THE ALLIANCE HAVE

18
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,276
BASICALLY JUST TOLERATED ME.

19
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,318
Jeff: WE ARE MERGED.

20
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,903
AFTER THE TWO TRIBES MERGED,

21
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:29,779
THEY WERE DEAD EVEN.

22
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,115
AT THIS POINT, IT'S A

23
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,158
DEAD-LOCKED 6-6 VOTE.

24
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,285
YOU ARE THE MOST POWERFUL MAN

25
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,119
IN THE GAME.

26
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,787
Jeff: BUT COACH SOMEHOW

27
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,289
CONVINCED COCHRAN TO JUMP FROM

28
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,373
SIX AT THE OLD SAVAII TO SEVEN

29
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,792
IN HIS ALLIANCE.

30
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,460
WHO IS THE STRONGEST,

31
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,295
STRONGEST MAN ON EARTH THEY

32
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,254
CALLED HIM?

33
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,172
HERCULES.

34
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:47,797
YUP.

35
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,757
I'M HERCULES.

36
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,299
I CONVINCED COCHRAN HE WILL

37
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,634
BE THE MAN OF THE MATCH.

38
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,302
Jeff: KEITH, THE TRIBE HAS

39
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,011
SPOKEN.

40
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:59,517
WITH THE NUMBERS ADVANTAGE THE

41
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,270
OLD UPOLU TRIBE PICKED OFF THE

42
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,440
OLD SAVAII TRIBE ONE BY ONE.

43
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,817
LEAVING OZZY, DAWN, AND WHITNEY

44
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,818
AT REDEMPTION ISLAND.

45
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,652
OH, MAN.

46
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,862
Jeff: WAITING TO BATTLE IT

47
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:11,196
OUT FOR A SHOT AT RETURNING TO

48
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,322
THE GAME.

49
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,449
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE SEVEN OF

50
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,534
YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED YOUR GOAL.

51
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,328
THE BAD NEWS-- NOWHERE LEFT TO

52
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:18,995
HIDE.

53
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:32,175
THIS GAME IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

54
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:37,430
AND THERE WERE SEVEN.

55
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,139
WHOO-HOO.

56
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,349
WE HAVE ERADICATED ALL FORMER

57
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,017
SAVAII MEMBERS.

58
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,812
WE HAVE SEVEN LEFT AND WE'RE

59
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,021
ALL FAMILY SO NOW WE HAVE TO

60
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,356
START SENDING HOME SOME OF OUR

61
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,110
OWN.

62
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,487
WAS ANYBODY WORRIED TONIGHT

63
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:52,737
OR NOT REALLY?

64
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,905
NO.

65
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,865
COMING BACK FROM TRIBAL, AT

66
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,367
LEAST THE SENSE OF PARANOIA,

67
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,368
BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE HAVE IDEAS

68
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,411
FLOATING AROUND WHO IS FIVE,

69
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,205
SIR, AND SEVEN, AND WHO IS NOT

70
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,208
IN THAT TOP FOUR?

71
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,584
I'M DELUDED INTO THINKING I'M

72
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,210
SAFE.

73
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,378
LIKE I SAID AT TRIBAL, I'M

74
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,047
GOING TO STICK TO IT.

75
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,342
I'M HAPPY WITH MY DECISION, NO

76
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,343
VACILLATING, NO QUESTIONING.

77
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,553
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS KIND OF

78
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,554
ALARMING TO ME BECAUSE IT WAS

79
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,555
MADE CLEAR I WAS THE PERSON THAT

80
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,016
WAS GOING IN SEVEN.

81
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,351
THANK YOU FOR ADOPTING ME INTO

82
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:23,893
YOUR FAMILY.

83
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,436
DOESN'T THIS FEEL GREAT?

84
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,897
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE FINALLY--

85
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,149
LIKE WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY

86
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,316
PEOPLE HERE I HATE IT.

87
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,402
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE A

88
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,069
TRIBE.

89
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,654
AFTER SURVIVING ANOTHER NIGHT

90
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,072
I REALIZE THE FAMILY COULD TURN

91
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,408
ON ME AT ANY MOMENT SO I'LL

92
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,367
REALLY REEVALUATING WHAT I NEED

93
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,577
TO DO TO GET FURTHER IN THIS

94
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,078
GAME TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT TAKEN

95
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,246
OUT BY THE FAMILY.

96
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:48,751
GOSH, HELTER-SKELTER.

97
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,419
Captioning brought to you by

98
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,003
Survivor Productions, CBS,

99
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,601
I'VE BEEN A GOOD KID AND DONE

100
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,227
WELL IN SCHOOL BUT FIFTH GRADE

101
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,771
FOR WHATEVER REASON WAS KIND OF

102
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,231
MY RAMBUNCTUS PERIOD.

103
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,942
I WASSED TO CHANGE MY REPUTATION

104
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,485
AS A BROWN NOSER SO THE NASTIEST

105
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,571
THING I COULD THINK OF WAS TO

106
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,906
START PRANK CALLING PEOPLE.

107
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,449
I DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF HOW

108
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,283
SEX WORKED SO I WAS CALLING

109
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,619
THESE GIRLS AND SAYING THINGS

110
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,286
LIKE, "I THINK YOU'RE SO HOT.

111
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,454
I REALLY WANT TO TRADE SPERM

112
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,915
WITH YOU."

113
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,332
( LAUGHTER ).

114
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,291
I'M SORRY 72.

115
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,460
AND THEN I'D HANG UP AND

116
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,337
THINK THAT WAS A SUCCESSFUL

117
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,004
PRANK CALL.

118
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,965
I ALWAYS THOUGHT PERSONALITY

119
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,466
IS SOMETHING COCHRAN HAS GOING

120
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,135
FOR HIM OUT HERE.

121
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,637
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE I FELT

122
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,472
KIND OF BAD FOR COCHRAN, BECAUSE

123
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,349
I FELT LIKE PEOPLE WERE BULLYING

124
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,434
HIM BUT I CAN SEE NOW WHY PEOPLE

125
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,311
GOT ANNOYED WITH HIM.

126
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,313
YOU KNOW, I GET FRUSTRATED BY

127
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,690
THE KIND OF AIR HE PUTS ON.

128
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,317
I THINK HE'S REALLY PROUD OF THE

129
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,360
MOVE HE MADE, AND I THINK HE

130
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,319
STILL THINKS THAT SOMEBODY WILL

131
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,488
TAKE HIM TO THE END.

132
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:09,374
I DON'T LIKE IT.

133
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:14,629
I DON'T LIKE IT.

134
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,338
THERE HAS KIND OF ALWAYS BEEN

135
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,382
THIS CULT-LIKE QUALITY TO THE

136
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,342
UPOLU FAMILY.

137
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,385
JUST HEARING THE WORD "FAMILY"

138
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,388
OVER AND OVER YOU CAN'T HELP BUT

139
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,974
THINK OF CHARLES MANSON AND THE

140
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,141
MANSON FAMILY AND THE FAMILY

141
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,185
THAT CREATED SO MANY HEINOUS

142
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:29,811
MURDERS.

143
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,522
HOLY GOD, HELP US TO STAY

144
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,523
STRONG, STAY AWAY FROM

145
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,400
TEMPTATION, FATHER GOD, DON'T

146
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,026
GET ANGRY WITH EACH OTHER AND

147
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,529
WE'LL JUST STAY A FAMILY IN

148
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,655
JESUS' NAME, AMEN.

149
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,032
BRANDON IN PARTICULAR SEEMS

150
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,534
ALMOST OBSESSIVELY DEVOUT, TO

151
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,785
THE POINT WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE

152
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,370
HE'S TRYING TO SUPPRESS

153
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,539
SOMETHING A LOT MORE SCARY.

154
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,543
I DON'T WANT TO BE SHARON

155
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,669
TATE IN THIS SCENARIO, AND I

156
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,379
NEED SOME SORT OF PLAN OR ELSE

157
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,547
I'M GOING TO BE EXTERMINATED.

158
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,217
I'M GOING TO BE GIVEN THE POISON

159
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:08,725
KOOL-AID AND MEET MY UNTIMELY

160
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,560
DEMISE.

161
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,520
GOOD MORNING, GUYS.

162
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,230
BASICALLY WHAT I WANTED TO TALK

163
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,065
ABOUT IS I REALIZE THAT MY NAME

164
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,066
IS PROBABLY BEING FLOATED AROUND

165
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,776
TO BE THE NEXT PERSON VOTED OUT

166
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,195
OF THE TRIBE, AND IT MAKES SENSE

167
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,989
BECAUSE I'M NEW HERE BUT I MADE

168
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:23,740
A BIG SACRIFICE TO KIND OF

169
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,950
CHANGE MY GAME, AND I FEEL LIKE

170
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,744
THE UPOLU TRIBE DID BENEFIT FROM

171
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,453
IT.

172
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,746
SO BASICALLY ALL I'M ASKING IS

173
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,956
FOR THE DEBT TO BE PAID BACK

174
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,791
JUST BY SAVING ME FROM ONE

175
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,500
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

176
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,085
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO PROMISE ME

177
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:36,753
FINAL FOUR OR EVEN FINAL FIVE.

178
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,755
I WOULD JUST REALLY, REALLY

179
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,422
APPRECIATE IT.

180
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,215
AND IT IS MY BIRTHDAY IN THREE

181
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,426
DAYS SO I'D LOVE TO CELEBRATE MY

182
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,429
BIRTHDAY WITH ALL OF YOU.

183
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,930
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT I'M

184
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,557
WILLING TO LEAVE AND LET YOU ALL

185
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:49,932
DISCUSS.

186
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,100
ALL RIGHT.

187
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,811
THANKS, COCHRAN.

188
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,980
COCHRAN SAID, "I KNOW A LOT

189
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,940
OF YOU FEEL INDEBTEDDED TO ME."

190
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,650
I DON'T FEEL INDEBTEDDED TO YOU.

191
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,234
SCREW YOU.

192
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,736
HE MADE AN AWFUL MOVE.

193
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,612
HE SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH HIS

194
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,321
TRIBE.

195
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,114
I'LL BE HONEST, GUYS, I'M NOT

196
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,324
REALLY GOING TO SAY MUCH BECAUSE

197
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,326
I THINK HE MAKES A VALID POINT

198
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:08,993
BUT IT'S NOT MY OPINION.

199
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,578
IT'S THE OPINION OF US FIVE.

200
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,789
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO I'LL

201
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,414
SUPPORT.

202
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,582
I AGREE WITH ALBERT, HE

203
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,500
SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR US AND I

204
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,876
WANT IT TO BE A GROUP DECISION.

205
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,128
I WOULD SAY THAT I WOULD VOTE

206
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,464
FOR SWITCHING IT TO KEEP COCHRAN

207
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,006
HERE ANOTHER DAY.

208
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,591
YES, I THINK HE MADE BIG

209
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,843
MOVES BUT I FEEL JUST AS

210
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,512
INDEBTED TO EDNA AS I DO TO

211
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,221
COCHRAN.

212
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,473
SO IF THIS IS A DEMOCRACY, MY

213
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,516
VOTE IS FOR COCHRAN.

214
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,936
ALBERT AND I SEE WE DO OWE

215
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,562
COCHRAN ANOTHER DAY IN THIS

216
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,271
GAME.

217
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,147
IF WE COULD JUST PULL ONE MORE

218
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,482
VOTE TO KEEP COCHRAN.

219
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,983
WE'VE GOTTEN DOWN TO THE SEVEN.

220
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:41,984
EVERYBODY IS FIGHTING TO BE

221
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:53,496
STANDING AT THE BITTER END.

222
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,664
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

223
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,667

224
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,835

225
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:04,757
OZZY, DAWN, AND WHITNEY.

226
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,592
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS KNOW THE

227
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,301

228
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,011
IN ORDER TO STAY IN THIS GAME,

FOR TODAY'S DUEL, YOU WILL

232
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,686
BALANCE CERAMIC DISHES ON THE

233
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,688
END OF A LONG, WOBBLY ARM.

234
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,899
THE MORE DISHES YOU STACK, THE

235
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,025
MORE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE TO

236
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:23,734
KEEP THEM STABLE.

237
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,196
WHEN YOUR DISHES FALL, YOU'RE

238
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,823
OUT OF THE DUEL.

239
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,367

00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,219
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY PICK UP

248
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:56,267
YOUR ARM AND PLACE IT.

249
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,393
FIRST DISH YOU'RE GOING TO PUT

250
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:02,064
ON IS A LARGE PLATE.

251
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,357
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT WHERE YOU

252
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,358
WANT IT.

253
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,777
GET COMFORTABLE WITH THAT ARM.

254
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,363
SEE WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE WHILE

255
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,573
YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO

256
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,240
EXPERIMENT.

00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,618
ALL RIGHT, LET'S ADD A LARGE

TAKE YOUR TIME.

260
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,122
PLACE IT, THINK ABOUT THE DISHES

261
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,749
THAT ARE GOING TO GO ON TOP OF

262
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,499
IT.

263
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:25,421
AS THIS STACK GROWS, IT'S GOING

264
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:37,683
TO GET DIFFICULT.

265
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:46,776
DAWN YAWN, AND ALMOST COST HER

THEY'RE NOW STACKED NINE DISHES

ANYBODY CAN WIN THIS GAME IF YOU

281
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:41,998

282
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,499

WHITNEY IS OUT OF THIS

301
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:46,979

00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:51,942
YOU JUST WANTED TO BREAK

306
00:10:52,026 --> 00:11:00,534

307
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,286
IT WAS A PLEASURE, LADIES.

308
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,956
IT WAS SUCH A PLEASURE.

309
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,042
Jeff: DAWN, WHAT'S THE

310
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,586
LESSON THAT YOU LEARNED ABOUT

311
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,879
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF IN LIFE?

312
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,924
THAT ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

313
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,008
THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

314
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,136
I MEAN, IT'S-- IT'S HONESTLY, I

315
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,013
MEAN, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE

316
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,932
FUEL FOR ME AND MY FAMILY AND MY

KIDS.

318
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,101
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE IF ONE OF MY

319
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,977
KIDS SAYS, "HEY, I'VE GOT THIS

320
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,854
PIPE DREAM," I'M GOING TO SAY,

321
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,565
"LET ME HANG ON AND LET'S GO."

322
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,233
I HOPE THE PEOPLE I'M AROUND

323
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,901
WILL FEEL THIS ENERGY I FELT

324
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,236
FROM SEEING THE IMPOSSIBLE

325
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,153

326
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,948
Jeff: DAWN, YOUR ADVENTURE,

327
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,950
SADLY FOR YOU, HAS COME TO AN

BUT I GOT TO TAKE IT.

330
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,287
Jeff: IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO

331
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:45,955

336
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,131
Jeff: OOH.

337
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,799
PUT IT IN?

338
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,843
Jeff: PUT IT IN.

339
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:06,851
SORRY.

340
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,852
WHITNEY, WHAT WAS THIS ADVENTURE

341
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,854
ABOUT FOR YOU?

342
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,189
JUST PROVING THAT YOU CAN DO

343
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:12,940
THIS.

344
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,358
IT WAS AMAZING, AND IT WAS HARD

345
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,651
BUT YOU MAKE IT THROUGH IT AND

346
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,986
YOU PUSH THROUGH ON THOSE DAYS

347
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,612
THAT YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN.

348
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,657
MY FAMILY IS GOING TO BE PROUD,

349
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,117
AND MY FRIENDS WILL BE PROUD,

350
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,827
AND SO I'M GOING TO BE PROUD.

351
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,204
28 DAYS IS A LONG TIME.

352
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,831
Jeff: WHITNEY, THIS PARENT

HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

372
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,997
FROM THIS POINT ON, I'M EVEN

373
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,874

375
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,377
MY ENEMIES IN THIS GAME.

376
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,379
I HAVE TO RELY ON MYSELF

377
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,714
WINNING, BUT THAT IS WHAT I DO

378
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,256
BEST, AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT I

379
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,384
WANT TO WIN THIS GAME.

380
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,661
I CAN SURVIVE OUT HERE ON

381
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,328
REDEMPTION.

382
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:49,995
I CAN KEEP GETTING STRONGER.

383
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,081
THIS IS MY HOME, REDEMPTION

384
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:52,748
ISLAND.

385
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,374
THIS IS HOW I'M PLAYING THE

386
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,750
SECOND HALF OF MY GAME AND

387
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,251
THERE'S NO ONE BETTER SUITED TO

388
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,169
BE OUT HERE THAN ME.

389
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,107
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

390
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,983
WHAT'S ON YOUR AGENDA?

391
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,944
I WAS GOING TO GO FISHING BUT

392
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,445
COCHRAN WANTED TO GO AND WHEN IT

393
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,989
COMES TO FISHING, THREE IS

394
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,740
COMPANY BUT FOUR'S A CROWD.

395
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,242
DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOTHES TO

396
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:28,909
WATCH?

397
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,618
EDNA IS OUT THERE DOING THE

398
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,620
LAUNDRY AND THE FUNNY THING IS,

399
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,081
YOU KNOW, THIS IS "SURVIVOR" THE

400
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:34,748
ULTIMATE STRATEGY GAME.

401
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,750
THE FLAIRS MY ALLIANCE THINK

402
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,086
IT'S NOT OUTWIT, OUTPLAY,

403
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:39,670
OUTLAST.

404
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,298
THEY THINK IT'S OUTCLEAN,

405
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,007
OUTGATHER, OUTORGANIZE.

406
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,633
TO ME THIS GAME IS ABOUT DOING

407
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,844
WELL IN CHALLENGES, CREATING A

408
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,137
GREAT STRATEGY, AND PLAYING A

409
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,930
STRONG SOCIAL GAME.

410
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,141
SO THOSE ARE WHAT I'M FOCUSED

411
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:52,808
ON.

412
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:53,309
I'LL LEAVE THE HOUSEWORK TO

413
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:59,023
MARTHA STEWART.

414
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,066
AWESOME, MAN.

415
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,652
IT'S GOT TEETH SO BE CAREFUL.

416
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,447
WHAT DO I DO?

417
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,197
I'M AFRAID OF HURTING MYSELF.

418
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,158
YOU'RE WHAT?

419
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,201
BRANDON JUST CAUGHT THIS

420
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,829
GIANT, REALLY SCARY LOOKING FISH

421
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,915
THAT HAVE THESE KIND OF

422
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,666
INTIMIDATING-LOOKING FANG TEETH

423
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,334
AND I'M IN CHARGE OF HOLDING IT

424
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,669
BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE SOME LIFE

425
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,838
IN IT SO I'M NERVOUS IT WILL

426
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,006
RESURRECT AND ATTACK ME.

427
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,341
BUT WHATEVER IT TAKES TO FEED

428
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,509
OUR TRIBE I'M WILLING TO PUT OUR

429
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,218
PLAINTIFF AND LIMB IN DANGER AND

430
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,929
BRANDON IS DOING AN AWESOME JOB

431
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,848
OF FISHING AND I'M HAPPY TO HELP

432
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:33,515
OUT.

433
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,808
I FEEL LIKE I'M PART OF THE

434
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,517
TEAM.

435
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,353
I DIDN'T PHYSICALLY CATCH IT,

436
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,188
BUT I'M PHYSICALLY HOLDING IT

437
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,147
AND I'LL BINGLY BE THE ONE TO

438
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,192
BRING IT BACK TO CAMP AND HIM

439
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,862
THE ONE THEY'LL HOIST ON THEIR

440
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,488
SHOULDERS.

441
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,031
EVERYBODY WORKED REAL HARD

442
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,698
TODAY, MAN.

443
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,532
I APPRECIATE YOU COMING OUT

444
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,367
THERE AND HELPING US.

445
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,368
I'M GLAD TO HELP.

446
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,786
THIS GUY WAS SO PATIENT.

447
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,871
HE WAS SITTING THERE...

448
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,706
BYE, EDNA.

449
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:10,219
BYE.

450
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,222
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

451
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,932
ALBERT PROCEEDED TO LAY IN

452
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,809
THE HAMMOCK AND WATCH ME FOR TWO

453
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,518
HOURS WHILE I DID THE LAUNDRY,

454
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,728
AND WHEN I STEPPED AWAY FROM THE

455
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,437
LAUNDRY FOR ONE MINUTE, I COME

456
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,107
BACK TO THE FIRE BEING DOUSED

457
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,233
OUT, AND THE EMBERS ARE WET AND

458
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,485
YOU CAN'T GET THE FIRE STARTED

459
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,403
THAT EASILY.

460
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,238
OH, THAT WAS SO INFURIATING.

461
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,241
ALBERT DOES PRETTY MUCH NOTHING

462
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,742
EXCEPT LIE AROUND AND EAT FISH

463
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,910
AND WAIT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO

464
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,745
WAIT ON HIM.

465
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,457
I DON'T THINK ALBERT HAS DONE

466
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,917
A DAY OF WORK IN HIS LIFE.

467
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,253
I THINK THAT BOTH HAS BEEN

468
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,921
HAND-CLOTHED, HAND-BATHED BY HIS

469
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,757
MOTHER SINCE HE WAS TWO.

470
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,759
HE JUST LITERALLY STAY ON THE

471
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,761
HAMMOCK FOR TWO HOURS AND SO NOW

472
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,056
I WAS LIKE THERE'S NO FIRE, THE

473
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,141
LAUNDRY IS NOT DONE AND ALBERT

474
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,226
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.

475
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,105
HE LITERALLY SAT THERE.

476
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,523
ALBERT IS A KIND OF PRECIOUS

477
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,232
THING IN CAMP.

478
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,109
HE'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE BARBIE

479
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:07,776
DOLLS.

480
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,444
THEY LOOK CUTE BECAUSE THEY

481
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,072
DON'T DO DO ANYTHING AND SIT

482
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:12,740
THERE.

483
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,824
THAT'S WHY I CALL HIM PRINCE

484
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,533
ALBERT.

485
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,951
IT'S LIKE I'M THE PRINCE AND YOU

486
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,162
GUYS WORK FOR ME.

487
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,246
IT JUST KILLS ME.

488
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,583
TELL ME I'M BASICALLY NEXT

489
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,793
PERSON TO GO AFTER COCHRAN.

490
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,294
IS THAT STILL TRUE?

491
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,963
I THINK SO, YES.

492
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,506
WHY?

493
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,341
BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO START

494
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,634
PICKING EVERYBODY OFF ONE ON

495
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,260
ONE.

496
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:37,806
I KNOW, BUT WHY AM I NEXT?

497
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,600
I FOUND OUT I'M BASICALLY THE

498
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,810
NEXT PERSON TO GO AFTER COCHRAN

499
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,978
WHICH MAKES ME FEEL AS THOUGH I

500
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,980
AM PRETTY LOW ON THE TOTEM POLE.

501
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,148
I DEFINITELY HAVE TO SHAKE IT UP

502
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,650
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SIXTH OR

503
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,194
SEVENTH IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR

504
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:50,903
ME.

505
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,655
DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, ANY

506
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,239
IDEAS?

507
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,659
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN, COACH?

508
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,329
MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE'RE AT A

509
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,874
CONSENSUS THAT COOK RAN IS NEXT?

510
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:08,670
YES.

511
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,380
KEEPING EDNA AND COCHRAN WOULD

512
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,298
BE THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO

513
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,133
BECAUSE THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO

514
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,676
VOTE ME OUT SO IT'S REALLY LIKE

515
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,677
A CATCH-22.

516
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,178
WHICH SIDE SHOULD I GO AT THIS

517
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:16,887
POINT.

518
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,639
DO I WANT TO HONOR MY WORD, BE A

519
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,723
MAN OF INTEGRITY, STICK WITH THE

520
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,141
FIVE OR DO I WANT TO GO ANOTHER

521
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,518
ROUTE?

522
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,603
NOTHING IS FOR SURE IN THIS GAME

523
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,363
YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING THIS

524
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:34,863
THIS MORNING?

525
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,198
WHY?

526
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,659
TO CENTER YOU AND EMPOWER

527
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:38,951
YOU.

528
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:39,243
RIGHT?

529
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,204
YEAH.

530
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,206
ONE OF THE TWO OF US SHOULD

531
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,499
WIN IMMUNITY TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE

532
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,208
DOING THIS.

533
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,251
THERE'S THAT ONE PLAYER ON EVERY

534
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,711
TEAM THAT YOU GIVE EVERYTHING

535
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,420
TO.

536
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,130
IT'S WHY YOU TEACH OR COACH AND

537
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,007
IT'S WHY I PLAY "SURVIVOR" TO

538
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,926
FIND THAT ONE STUDENT THAT WANTS

539
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,593
TO LEARN.

540
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:01,515
SO I TOOK COCHRAN OUT TO DO

541
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,224
THI CHI.

542
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,267
I DO FEEL LIKE I OWE COCHRAN AND

543
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,226
I FEEL LIKE I OWE HIM SOME TYPE

544
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,562
OF HOPE GOING INTO THE

545
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,229
CHALLENGE.

546
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:07,896
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF

547
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,439
CHALLENGE IT'S GOING TO BE AND

548
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,441
MAYBE, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY IT

549
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,403
WILL EMPOWER HIM.

550
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,237
UP.

551
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,447
COACH, FOR ALL THE JOKES

552
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,365
ABOUT IT AND ALL THE JOKES

553
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,951
DIRECTED AT COACH, IT IS A

554
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,578
VALUABLE THING FOR ME TO DO.

555
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,621
USUALLY I HAVE ALL THESE

556
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,289
CONFLICTING GOALS BOUNCING

557
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,499
AROUND IN MY HEAD-- HOW DO I

558
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,293
CURRY FAVOR WITH BRANDON, HOW DO

MAKE COACH LIKE ME-- BUT NOW ALL

750
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,769
THERE'S A GUY HERE WHO HAS A

751
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,479
BIRTHDAY IN TWO DAYS.

752
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:04,938
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO THE

753
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:05,647
BIRTHDAY BOY.

754
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,650
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO COCHRAN.

755
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,818
Jeff: COME ON OVER.

756
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,820
THANK YOU.

757
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,696
Jeff: SO, COCHRAN, IS A

758
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,323
MASSAGE SOMETHING YOU'RE LOOKING

759
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:15,949
FORWARD TO.

760
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,825
YEAH, I'VE GIVEN MY MOM

761
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,994
MACANNELS OVER THE YEARS BUT

762
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,496
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY PERSONALLY

763
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,497
RECEIVED ONE.

764
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:22,998
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ON

765
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,665
THE RECEIVING END.

766
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,250
MY BROTHER IS IN TWO DAYS AND

767
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,501
THIS IS A GREAT GIFT.

768
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,003
I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

769
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,962
Jeff: ALBERT HAS IMMUNITY

770
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,381
SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

771
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,173
HE GIVES UP HIS REWARD.

772
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,008
COACH AND COCHRAN WILL GO BACK

773
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,761
ENJOY A NICE SHOWER AND A
MASSAGE.

774
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,346
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK TO

775
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,183
CAMP. CONGRATS.

776
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:42,726
ALBERT OFFERED THE REWARD TO

777
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,393
ME.

778
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,102
THERE ARE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE

779
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,146
EXPLANATIONS FOR HIS DECISION.

780
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:46,813
ONE, HE WANTS TO WORK

781
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,858
STRATEGICALLY WITH ME AND IS

782
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,859
TRYING TO CURRIE FAVOR WITH ME

783
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:51,860
WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD OPTION.

784
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,862
TWO, IT WOULD BE A SWEET

785
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,449
FAREWELL GIFT FOR ME TO LIKE HIM

786
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,867
WHEN I GET ON THE JURY.

787
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,952
EITHER WAY. I HOPE I GET TO STAY
ONE MORE NIGHT IN THE SOUTH
PACIFIC.

788
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,769
THANK YOU, ALBERT.

789
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,939
OH, MY GOSH!

790
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:30,940
WALKING BACK INTO CAMP,

791
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,734
EVERYTHING IS LAID OUT FOR

792
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,401
COCHRAN AND I.

793
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,696
WE'VE GOT TWO MASSAGE TABLES

794
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,405
READY.

795
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,239
WE'VE GOT A SHOWER TO THE LEFT

796
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:38,948
SIDE.

797
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,367
WE'VE GOT TWO BEAUTIFUL SOUTH

798
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:40,950
PACIFIC WOMEN THAT ARE READY TO

799
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:41,826
MASSAGE US.

800
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,039
THERE'S OILS THERE.

801
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:46,956
EVERYTHING SMELLS BEAUTIFUL,

802
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,250
FRESH, NEW, CLEAN.

803
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,253
THE WATER'S LIKE-- IT LIKE

804
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,923
SMELLS SCENTED LIKE JASMINE OR

805
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:55,590
SOMETHING.

806
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,758
COCHRAN, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

807
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,426
LET ME TELL YOU.

808
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,928
I'M TRYING NOT TO USE ALL THE

809
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,470
WATER.

810
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,722
YEAH, TRY A LITTLE BIT

811
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,431
HARDER.

812
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:03,973
UP TO THIS POINT, I'VE NEVER HAD

813
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,725
A MASSAGE.

814
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,976
I'M THRILLED TO SEE THAT, YOU

815
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,937
KNOW, SOME STUPID LITTLE WHITE

816
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,647
LIE ABOUT WHEN MY BIRTHDAY WAS--

817
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,981
WHICH ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE SIX

818
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,858
MONTHS AGO-- IS HELPING ME

819
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,026
SOMEWHAT IN THIS GAME, EVEN IF

820
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,779
IT'S TO GET A FREE MASSAGE.

821
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,613
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

822
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,322
IT FEELS GREAT.

823
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,951
I MEAN, HAVING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

824
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,078
STROKE THE INSIDE OF MY LEGS IS

825
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:25,995
A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME.

826
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,707
THIS IS JUST AMAZINGLY

827
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,584
REJUVENATING TO HAVE THIS KIND

828
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,920
OF TREATMENT OUT HERE ON DAY 30.

829
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,797
I COULDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING

830
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,423
BETTER THAN THAT.

831
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,383
ACTUALLY, I COULD ASK FOR

832
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,759
COCHRAN'S LIFE TO BE SAVED

833
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,468
TONIGHT.

834
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,470
I WILL FIGHT FOR MY MAN COCHRAN

835
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,013
WITH MY LAST DYING BREATH.

836
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,974
OF THAT YOU CAN BE ASSURED, MY

837
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,642
YOUNG WARRIOR.

838
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,769
I'VE UPGRADED TO WARRIOR.

839
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,812
WASN'T I A STUDENT BEFORE?

840
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,107
YOU'RE A YOUNG WARRIOR RIGHT

841
00:28:54,190 --> 00:29:00,029
NOW.

842
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,490
AFTER I RECEIVED MY SPA

843
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,158
REWARD, I PULLED ASIDE ALBERT,

844
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,160
NOT ONLY TO THANK HIM BUT TO

845
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,619
KIND OF GET A FEELING OF WHETHER

846
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,328
HE WAS WILLING TO CONTINUE

847
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,330
WORKING WITH ME, KNOWING FULL

848
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:09,998
WELL THAT MY NAME IS, YOU KNOW,

849
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,209
THE ONE BEING FLOATED AROUND THE

850
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,461
MOST TO BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

851
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,004
QUITE FRANKLY, IT'S NOT

852
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,881
LOOKING TOO GOOD FOR YOUR CASE.

853
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,048
I WAS PRETTY SURE COACH WAS ON

854
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:19,799
BOARD.

855
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,342
I WAS ABLE TO SWAY HIM A LITTLE

856
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,969
BIT AND TALK HIM INTO IT.

857
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:23,970
THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T THINK

858
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,555
HE'S READY TO MAKE A HUGE MOVE

859
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,682
THAT WOULD BE GETTING RID OF,

860
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:28,516
LIKE, A RICK--

861
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,101
I KNOW HE IS.

862
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,352
I KNOW FOR A FACT HE IS.

863
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,520
YOU THINK SO?

864
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,855
NO QUESTION.

865
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,024
COACH WILL VOTE OUT RICK.

866
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,693
HE CALLS HIM PRINCESS ALBERT.

867
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,319
WHEN DID YOU HEAR THAT?

868
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,488
AROUND THE FIRE YESTERDAY.

869
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,364
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU I'M NOT--

870
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,032
OBVIOUSLY, I'M IN SURVIVAL MODE

871
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,243
RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M TELLING YOU

872
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:47,911
100%.

873
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,578
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HAPPY IT

874
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,706
WOULD MAKE ME TO SEE YOU GO

875
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:52,332
FATHER THAN RICK IN THIS GAME.

876
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,876
IT COULD MAKE ME ECSTATIC.

877
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,753
RICK, TO BEGIN WITH, HE'S

878
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,338
ABOUT AS SMART AS A BOWLING

879
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,758
BALL, AND THEN I HEAR HE'S

880
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,592
CHIRPING IN THE BACKGROUND,

881
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,176
CALLING ME NAMES, DROPPING A

882
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:03,927
PRINCESS HERE AND THERE.

883
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,221
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, RICK?

884
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,806
I HAVE A MIND TO GET RID OF RICK

885
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,891
ON THIS VOTE.

886
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,018
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF HE'D DO IT.

887
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,686
I PROMISE YOU THIS-- IF HE DOES

888
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:20,902
IT, YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, 100%.

889
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,404
HE'S PISSED OFF AT RICK NOW

890
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,198
BECAUSE HE HEARD ABOUT THE

891
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:25,740
PRINCESS ALBERT.

892
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:26,074
THAT ANNOYS HIM A LOT.

893
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:26,699
GOOD.

894
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,410
HE WANTS TO VOTE OUT RICK.

895
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,621
DUDE.

896
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,164
I'M ON BOARD.

897
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,042
ALBERT CAUGHT WIND THAT RICK WAS

898
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,752
CALLING HIM PRINCESS ALBERT,

899
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,045
PRINCE ALBERT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T

900
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,714
DO ANYTHING AROUND CAMP.

901
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,132
COCHRAN AND I TRYING TO USE THAT

902
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,218
INFORMATION TO TRY TO GET COACH

903
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,053
TO COME WITH US TO VOTE RICK

904
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:47,762
OFF.

905
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,889
I FEEL LIKE IF WE DON'T USE YOU

906
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,975
TO OUR MAXIMUM BENEFIT, PART OF

907
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,768
THE REASON WE WON THAT LAST

908
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,479
GROUP CHALLENGE AND WERE 6-6

909
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,105
INTO THE MERGE IS BECAUSE OF

910
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:57,855
YOU.

911
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,733
I THINK THAT WE OWE YOU MORE OF

912
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,818
A, YOU KNOW, DEBT.

913
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,777
I LIKE YOU.

914
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,611
I LIKE COACH.

915
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,070
YEAH.

916
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:11,953
I LIKE YOU, TOO.

917
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,789
I TALKED TO ALBERT.

918
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:19,919
HE GAVE ME THIS WHOLE SPIEL IT'S

919
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:28,970
NOT LOOKING SO GOOD.

920
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:50,116
NOT LOOKING SO GOOD.

921
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,161
MY DECISION TONIGHT AND WHICH

922
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,163
WAY I GO IS GOING TO DETERMINE

923
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,458
THE REST OF THIS GAME.

924
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,836
THERE IS A TIDE THAT IS COMING.

925
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,923
I EITHER TAKE IT AND GO WITH A

926
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:10,178
NEW ALLIANCE, OR STAY WITH MY

927
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,513
FIRST FIVE.

928
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,806
AS WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE SAYS,

929
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,515
THERE'S A TIDE THAT COMES IN THE

930
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,143
LIVES OF MEN THAT WHEN TAKEN,

931
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,687
LEADS TO GREAT FORTUNE.

932
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,023
BUT WHEN OMIDST IT, ALL THE REST

933
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,068
OF THEIR LIVES ARE BOUND IN

934
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,194
SHADOWS AND MISERY.

935
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,155
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I MAKE

936
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,156
THE RIGHT DECISION.

937
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,742
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY TAKE

938
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,327
THE RIGHT TIDE SO THAT I CAN

939
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,536
RIDE THAT TIDE ALL THE WAY TO

940
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,163
THE END OF THIS GAME THAT I LOVE

941
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,247
SO DEARLY.

942
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:55,431
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

943
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,727
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

944
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,895
JIM.

945
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:01,688
KEITH.

946
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,564
DAWN.

947
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,649
AND WHITNEY.

948
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,280
COACH, WHERE DOES THIS RANK IN

949
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,741
TERMS OF ALL THE POSSIBILITIES

950
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,576
THAT COULD HAPPEN WITH TONIGHT'S

951
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,285
VOTE?

952
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,078
I THINK THE POSSIBILITIES ARE

953
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:17,829
ENDLESS.

954
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,372
I MEAN, THEY REALLY ARE BECAUSE

955
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,123
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS IF THEY'RE

956
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,583
GOING TO THE FINAL THREE, IF

957
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,794
THEY'RE FOUR, FIVE, SIX, OR

958
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,503
SEVEN.

959
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,421
THERE'S A NEW SCENARIO THAT'S

960
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,423
PRESENTED TO ME AND ALBERT AND

961
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,216
EVERYBODY HERE EVERY HOUR.

962
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,551
IT'S BEEN CRAZY.

963
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,301
Jeff: COCHRAN, DID YOU FEEL

964
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,220
THE SCRAMBLING HAPPENING TODAY?

965
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,930
OH, ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I TOOK

966
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:36,681
PART IN IT.

967
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,559
I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO FILL THE

968
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,768
JURY WITH GLEE TO DISCOVER I'M

969
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,769
PROBABLY IN GREAT DANGER

970
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,521
TONIGHT, AND I FEEL LIKE AN

971
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,897
IDIOT KIND OF.

972
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,941
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND GREEDY BUT

973
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,234
I'M HERE TO COLLECT A DEBT.

974
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,152
I GAVE LIFE TO THIS TRIED AND TO

975
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,654
BE TARGETED FOR SEVENTH IT'S A

976
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,239
LITTLE BIT HUMILIATING.

977
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,907
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT DUPED.

978
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,409
THE MASSAGE WAS ONE NICE WAY OF

979
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,286
PAYING OFF THE DEBT BUT I FEEL

980
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,121
LIKE I'M ENTITLED TO AT LEAST

981
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,664
ONE MORE NIGHT IN THIS GAME.

982
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,958
JUST TO COMMENT ON THAT POINT

983
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,418
I VOCALIZE TO THE TRIBE I

984
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,753
THOUGHT IT'S NOT IN THE BEST

985
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,964
INTEREST OF OUR QUOTE, UNQUOTE

986
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:10,673
IMAGE, TO USE AND ABUSE SOMEONE,

987
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,967
AND I DON'T REGRET MY DECISION

988
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,260
OF GIVING HIM THE REWARD, AND I

989
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,344
DON'T WANT HIM TO REGRET HIS

990
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:15,887
DECISION.

991
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,596
Jeff: COACH, DOES IT

992
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,098
CONCERN YOU A LITTLE WHEN YOU

993
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,725
HAVE ALBERT SAYING, "I THINK

994
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,434
COCHRAN'S RIGHT?"

995
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,226
AS EVERYBODY KNOWS, WE'RE IN

996
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,021
THIS GOOD STANDING BECAUSE

997
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,982
COCHRAN MADE A MOVE THAT SOME

998
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,817
PEOPLE CONSIDERED COWARDICE.

999
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,485
OTHERS, INCLUDING MYSELF,

1000
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,654
THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BOLD AND

1001
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,322
COURAGEOUS.

1002
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,490
Jeff: RICK, ARE YOU WORRIED

1003
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,492
AT ALL IF COCHRAN DOES PLAY HIS

1004
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,826
CARD TONIGHT THAT MEANS IT'S ONE

1005
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,161
OF THE OTHER SIX?

1006
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,829
OH, ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE IT'S A

1007
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,664
MILLION BUCKS, YEAH.

1008
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,166
I'VE GOT MY BAGS PACKED.

1009
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,375
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO, BUT,

1010
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:46,918
YEAH.

1011
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,377
Jeff: EDNA, ARE YOU

1012
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,838
EMOTIONAL TONIGHT OR ARE YOU--

1013
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,381
YEAH, I'M A LITTLE EMOTIONAL

1014
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,299
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M SIXTH,

1015
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,676
YOU KNOW, THE PERCEPTION THAT

1016
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,844
THE SIX WERE EQUAL.

1017
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,512
THAT WAS A DELUSION.

1018
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,847
I WAS LED TO THINK THAT I WAS

1019
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,141
EQUAL IN CERTAIN PEOPLE'S MINDS,

1020
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:02,683
WE WEREN'T.

1021
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,768
Jeff: SO YOUR EMOTION IS

1022
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,520
ANGER, HURT, SADNESS?

1023
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,021
SADNESS.

1024
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,189
I FEEL LIKE I'VE ALREADY BEEN

1025
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,108
DECEIVED LEADING UP TO HERE,

1026
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,319
LIKE, OKAY, I'M SIXTH.

1027
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,445
THAT DOESN'T FEEL VERY GOOD.

1028
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,740
Jeff: SO, EDNA, IF COCHRAN

1029
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,033
BELIEVES HE'S SEVENTH AND YOU

1030
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,076
BELIEVE YOU'RE SIXTH, ALL YOU

1031
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,452
NEED IS TO FIND WHO'S FIFTH AND

1032
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,204
WHO'S FOURTH BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

1033
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,539
IN THE MONEY, EITHER.

1034
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,414
YEAH, SURE.

1035
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:30,211
TALK TO PEOPLE AND FIND A LITTLE

1036
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,879
CRACK, AND EXPANDING THAT.

1037
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,506
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PUBLICITY

1038
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,132
ACT.

1039
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,216
SO WE HAVE TO FIND CERTAIN

1040
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,384
ANGLES AND APPROACH THEM.

1041
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,219
Jeff: JEFF.

1042
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,011
Jeff: BRANDON.

1043
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:39,720
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS WHAT'S

1044
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,764
GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THESE TWO.

1045
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,473
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M VOTING

1046
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,934
OUT COCHRAN AND THEN THE NEXT

1047
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,352
NIGHT MY VOTE IS FOR EDNA.

1048
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:50,064
LET'S NOT TRY TO BE SO GRAY OUT

1049
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,440
THERE AND JUST GET IT OUT THERE.

1050
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,317
I DO BELIEVE THERE'S BLACK AND

1051
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,610
WHITE AND IF THERE'S GRAY, YOU

1052
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,903
MIGHT AS WELL BE LYING, TO BE

1053
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,779
HONEST WITH YOU.

1054
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,406
Jeff: COACH, BRANDON NOW

1055
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,448
POSES A HUGE PROBLEM FOR ANYBODY

1056
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,909
IN HIS ALLIANCE.

1057
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,743
HE IS NOT MALLEABLE.

1058
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,579
SO IF SOMETHING GOES HAYWIRE

1059
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,247
WITH OUR PLAN, BRANDON AIN'T

1060
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,248
GOING TO HELP.

1061
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,916
RIGHT, THE FACT THAT BRANDON

1062
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,710
IS NOT MALLEABLE IN THIS GAME IS

1063
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,044
BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE.

1064
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,921
IF YOU'RE WITH HIM, YOU KNOW

1065
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,256
THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO TURN ON

1066
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,133
YOU, BUT YOU'RE ALSO AFRAID THAT

1067
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,467
HE'S GOING TO SPILT APPLE CART.

1068
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,553
Jeff: BRANDON, ARE YOU

1069
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,554
EXHAUSTED RIGHT NOW?

1070
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:27,935
YEAH.

1071
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,604
Jeff: WHAT HAS TRIED YOU

1072
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,938
THE MOST IN THIS GAME?

1073
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,482
I WANT TO DO WRONG THINGS.

1074
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,569
I'M HUMAN.

1075
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:41,073
BUT I-- THERE'S SOMETHING ST

1076
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,619
STRONGER INSIDE ME THAT WON'T

1077
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:49,582
LET ME.

1078
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,875
ANYTHING WORTH HAVING IS NOT

1079
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,918
GOING TO BE EASY.

1080
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,419
SO THAT'S ALL I'M TELLING MYSELF

1081
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,503
IN MY HEAD.

1082
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,671
ANYTHING WORTH HAVING IS NOT

1083
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,507
GOING TO BE EASY.

1084
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:02,261
THAT'S ALL.

1085
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,763
Jeff: COCHRAN, AS HARD AS

1086
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,514
IT IS TO SEE BRANDON UPSET FROM

1087
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,308
A GAME POINT OF VIEW, IT'S A

1088
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,643
SPARK OF LIFE.

1089
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,937
MAYBE THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

1090
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,813
I MEAN, I THINK BRANDON'S

1091
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,981
REVEALED HE'S PROBABLY NOT THE

1092
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,108
BEST PERSON TO BE IN A STRATEGIC

1093
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,485
PARTNERSHIP WITH.

1094
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,196
TALKING STRAIT WITH BRANDON IS

1095
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,658
LIKE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SHIRTS

1096
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,034
THAT AREN'T BLUE BLUE.

1097
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,661
HE DOESN'T COMPREHEND IT.

1098
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,121
IT ISN'T IN HIS VOCABULARY.

1099
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,498
I WOULDN'T WANT TO COME UP WITH

1100
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,501
STRATEGIC IDEAS WITH HIM BECAUSE

1101
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,462
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT

1102
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,088
LANGUAGE.

1103
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,173
Jeff: ALBERT, IS THAT TRUE

1104
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,092
ABOUT BRANDON?

1105
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,426
CHARACTER ASIDE, NOT THE

1106
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:42,718
GREATEST STRATEGY PLAYER OUT

1107
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,010
HERE?

1108
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,761
YEAH.

1109
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,515
I THINK IT'S SOMETIMES UNSETTLE

1110
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,558
GLG SO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS IN

1111
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,018
THIS GAME AND YOUR ALLIANCE HAS

1112
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,145
TO MAKE A DIFFERENT MOVE AND

1113
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,523
BRANDON SAYS, "WISH I COULD,

1114
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,190
CAN'T."

1115
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:58,484
I THINK RIGHT NOW THE WAY OUR

1116
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,152
TRIBE IS I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT

1117
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,070
ANYTHING HAPPENING IN THE GAME.

1118
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:01,988
AND I THINK--

1119
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:06,200
IF EDNA WINS IMMUNITY, WHAT

1120
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:06,575
HAPPENS?

1121
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,577
Jeff: WOW.

1122
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,538
THEN IT STARTS.

1123
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,415
Jeff: THIS HAS BEEN A BIT

1124
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,085
OF AN EYE-OPENING TRIBAL, HASN'T
IT?

1125
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:16,877
NO?

1126
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,336
NO.

1127
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,672
Jeff: REALLY?

1128
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,008
SO, COCHRAN, HOW FRUSTRATING IS

1129
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,885
IT IF THE MOVE YOU MADE WAS FOR

1130
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,553
NAUGHT?

1131
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,554
IT'S INTENSELY FRUSTRATING.

1132
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,056
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING SOME SAVVY

1133
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,517
GAME PLAYER AND THEN I GET VOTED

1134
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,520
OUT IN A WORSE POSITION THAN I

1135
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,439
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE IF I STUCK

1136
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,565
WITH MY OLD TRIBE.

1137
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,692
IT'S EXTREMELY HUMILIATING.

1138
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,444
I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING A

1139
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,194
"SURVIVOR" EXPERT.

1140
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,571
I HOPE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE ONE

1141
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,448
OF THE MOST IDIOTIC MOVES IN THE

1142
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,575
HISTORY OF THE GAME.

1143
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,534
Jeff: IT HAS BEEN ONE OF

1144
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,412
THE MOST INTERESTING AND

1145
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,580
REVEALING TRIBAL COUNCILS OF THE

1146
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,330
SEASON.

1147
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,458
ALBERT HAS THE NECKLACE, CANNOT

1148
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,751
VOTE FOR ALBERT.

1149
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,294
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1150
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,920
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1151
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:09,388
BRANDON, YOU'RE UP.

1152
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,473
COCHRAN, THANKS FOR MAKING

1153
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,808
THE BIG MOVE WHEN YOU MADE IT.

1154
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:20,524
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

1155
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:24,070
RICK, I'M WRITING YOUR NAME

1156
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:24,779
DOWN.

1157
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,323
HOPEFULLY THE OTHER THREE PEOPLE

1158
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,824
IN OUR SUBALLIANCE WILL BE

1159
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:38,918
WRITING YOUR NAME DOWN, TOO

1160
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:49,136
WRITING YOUR NAME DOWN, TOO

1161
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:56,477
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1162
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,978
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1163
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:58,687
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1164
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,688
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1165
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:04,610
TO DO SO.

1166
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,821
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES READ, THE

1167
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,488
DECISION IS FINAL.

1168
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,572
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1169
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,782
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1170
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,658
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1171
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,952
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1172
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:18,999

00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:44,900
THAT'S FOUR.

1187
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,609
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1188
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:54,827
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1189
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,204
COCHRAN, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1190
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,539
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

1191
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,081
BACK IN THIS GAME.

1192
00:40:59,165 --> 00:40:59,748
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD TO

1193
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,876
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1194
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,543
GOOD LUCK.

1195
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,713
JEFF PROBST, JUST SNUFFED MY

1196
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,088
TORCH.

1197
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:06,755
IT'S UNREAL.

1198
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,590
A DREAM COME TRUE.

1199
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,550
SEE YOU, COCHRAN.

1200
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,217
GEEZ.

1201
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,218
Jeff: JUST TAKE THE STEPS.

1202
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:17,933
YEAH.

1203
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:18,642
Jeff: WELL, THERE WAS A LOT

1204
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,228
OF INFORMATION REVEALED TONIGHT,

1205
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,063

1206
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,065
WILL BE DETERMINED BY WHAT YOU

1207
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,233
DO WITH IT.

1208
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:26,859
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1209
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,235
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1210
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,361
GOOD NIGHT.

1211
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:40,414
JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1212
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,166
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1213
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,002
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1214
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:45,586
"SURVIVOR":

1215
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,755
OUR TRIBE IS HONOR AND

1216
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,549
INTEGRITY, AND THEN YOU ALLOW

1217
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,383
SUCH BEHAVIOR.

1218
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:51,675
Jeff: BRANDON'S IN DEEP

1219
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,343
TROUBLE.

1220
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,844
ON A DAY WE THOUGHT EDNA WAS

1221
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,678
DEFINITELY GOING TO GO HOME

1222
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,721
THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.

1223
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,933
Jeff: AND COCHRAN IS IN

1224
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,433
EVEN DEEPER.

1225
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:03,437
YOU HAVE A CHANCE.

1226
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:03,812
HE REALLY DOESN'T STAND A

1227
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:07,274
CHANCE.

THE BICK MOVE I MADE AT THE

1235
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,453
MERGE IN JUMPING OVER TO UPOLU,

1236
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:19,870
IN RETROSPECT, MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

1237
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,788
THE BEST MOVE.

1238
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,123
I ABSOLUTELY FEEL LIKE UPOLU

1239
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:23,666
USED ME.

1240
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,375
THE FACT THAT THEY DID

1241
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,793
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SHOW ANY

1242
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,877
SORT OF GRATITUDE, APART FROM
