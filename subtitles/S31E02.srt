translated from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,778
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:05,613
You will have a 2nd chance!

4
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:07,681
After being chosen
by America,

5
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:09,081
20 former players

6
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:10,676
flew to Cambodia.

7
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,739
They have a second chance

8
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:15,047
to change the way
they played the 1st time

9
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:16,912
and finish what they started.

10
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:20,661
Welcome to
Survivor: Cambodia, Second Chance!

11
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:22,621
I'm here to make a million,

12
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:25,457
and when it's over,
I'll pray for forgiveness.

13
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:27,201
In the Ta Keo tribe...

14
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:29,003
Have you seen my bag?

15
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:30,496
My bracelet is in it.

16
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:32,873
...Abi was fighting against herself.

17
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:35,109
It's so hard
not to bare your fangs!

18
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,478
- My bracelet!
- Is that Peih-Gee's bag?

19
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:41,048
But the real battle
was between two styles of play:

20
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,266
the old school
and the new school.

21
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,817
The new school swore
by strategy.

22
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:47,112
I wanted to board

23
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:49,715
the people that interest me
and lock the stuff.

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,106
The old school was
all about relationships and survival.

25
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,896
We don't do more
"old school Survivor" than I do!

26
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:59,158
And veteran Varner
found himself stuck in between.

27
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:02,403
No matter who takes me
into the woods, I say "yes".

28
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:06,140
In the Bayon tribe,
the strong men bonded.

29
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:07,282
Everything is fine.

30
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,743
But Stephen couldn't find his place

31
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:11,403
and his tribe suspected him

32
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:13,414
to look for an idol.

33
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:15,583
I believe he is "looking for an idol".

34
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,775
Oh really ?

35
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:18,686
In an unprecedented twist,

36
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,856
Kelley found a
hidden idol at the immunity trial.

37
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,257
Joe is on the key!

38
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,659
But it was Joe who found success.

39
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:27,795
Bayon wins immunity!

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,101
And it only got worse for Ta Keo.

41
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:32,199
We're off to the board...

42
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:33,425
immediately.

43
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,394
At the council,

44
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,805
Varner had to choose sides.

45
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,466
It's my second chance.
I don't want to spoil it.

46
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:42,810
In the end, Abi had four votes...

47
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,245
First person eliminated
from Survivor Second Chance...

48
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,148
...but it was Vytas
who was eliminated...

49
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,440
The tribe has spoken.

50
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:50,618
...leaving Terry,

51
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:51,752
Wiglesworth

52
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,279
and Woo at the bottom.

53
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,815
Your second chance
can end at any time.

54
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,783
And as you came to the council,

55
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:01,195
fire, in the form of flint,
will be waiting for you at the camp.

56
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,679
There are 19 left.

57
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:04,738
Who will be eliminated tonight?

58
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:21,949
The advice was overwhelming.

59
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:24,442
I didn't
think Varner would switch sides.

60
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,738
It sucks to be at the bottom of the ladder.

61
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:29,014
I didn't want to start
this 2nd chance like this.

62
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,220
My alliance needs to pull itself together.

63
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:38,802
Shirin and Spencer set the tone,
forming alliances and plotting.

64
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,836
- I put that there?
- Yeah, go ahead.

65
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:43,660
We have to defend ourselves.

66
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:45,864
Or we're screwed.

67
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:49,129
I'll go get some wood.

68
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:51,993
Yesterday, we went directly
from the test to the advice.

69
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:54,081
I have to find the time

70
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:56,350
to read my idol,
which I treasure.

71
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:59,378
I don't even know what she looks like
or what the message says.

72
00:03:04,486 --> 00:03:05,683
My idol.

73
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,821
Oui !

74
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:12,672
This Second Chance season
is already crazy.

75
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:15,717
I'm really happy
to have some security.

76
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,127
It's splendid.

77
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:19,598
I'm really excited!
Oh my God !

78
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:23,226
Yes !
What a great day!

79
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,712
Play a 2nd time

80
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,055
get a 2nd chance...

81
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,949
I want to do everything
I didn't do the first time.

82
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,964
I want to be aggressive,
to be a real player.

83
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:34,388
It's really important.
It's a second chance.

84
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:35,881
Go hard or get out.

85
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:37,158
Oui !

86
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:43,354
We have a good group, you know?

87
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,558
I would like to decide
who is next.

88
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,214
One of the three, right?

89
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,536
It's okay with me.

90
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:53,265
After Vytas left,

91
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,056
the impression was
that the new school

92
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,837
had won over the old woman
in the first vote.

93
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:02,049
Terry, Wiglesworth and Woo
missed the mark.

94
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:03,428
I betrayed them yesterday.

95
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:05,519
I hope that shows you
my loyalty.

96
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:07,212
- Sure.
- Absolutely.

97
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:08,981
We are nine in this tribe.

98
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:10,816
With Abi, we are five.

99
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:12,834
We have nothing to worry about.

100
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,496
Spencer and Shirin
feel comfortable.

101
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:18,199
But maybe they shouldn't.

102
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,391
I'm serious !

103
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:23,304
My plan, in eliminating Vytas,
was to show old school

104
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,006
that they have to start playing,
and set the tone

105
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,667
to eliminate Shirin and Spencer.

106
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,045
They play way too deep,
strategically speaking.

107
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,104
I want to take one of them out
of the equation.

108
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:34,452
I didn't want Abi to leave.

109
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:37,171
She was the wrong choice.
His time has not come.

110
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,466
Abi, it's easy.

111
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,908
This game is moving like lightning.

112
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,583
And these threats...

113
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:44,850
must disappear.

114
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:48,277
It can't just be a name
like that, that's old school.

115
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:50,404
It's a new day.

116
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:53,492
Don't look like
you don't know what you're doing.

117
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:55,861
Yesterday's vote was a revelation.

118
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:58,339
Shake your ass and play!

119
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,341
We are not in 2001.

120
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,249
I want to eliminate Spencer.

121
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:03,956
Ou Shirin.

122
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,569
These two are playing.
They have to go.

123
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:08,908
If I have to go to the end,
it will be with the elders.

124
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,376
Not with them.

125
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,911
Leaving the board

126
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:13,679
I felt terrible.

127
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:16,888
But Varner started with a bang
and is playing hard.

128
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:18,680
Survivor has changed.

129
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,683
My 2nd chance includes Terry Deitz

130
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:23,622
playing a social game.

131
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,106
Otherwise, I'll be cleared.

132
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,223
- You understand me ?
- Yes. We're going to do that.

133
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,958
I'm looking for a spy hideout!

134
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,799
Nice idea!

135
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:13,201
I can do anything if I put my mind to it.

136
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:15,770
I want to have fun here,
I want to do stuff.

137
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,682
Nobody likes to sleep
on bamboos, so I said:

138
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,042
"Let's make hammocks!"

139
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,911
Look at this brave Steve!

140
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:27,749
Last time,
I was by far the biggest threat.

141
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:30,211
So in this season

142
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,461
It's nice

143
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,222
to be the one who provides a service.

144
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,422
It is not bad at all !

145
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:40,228
I want people to need
and want my presence.

146
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,360
The island of paradise!

147
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,718
Devil, yes!

148
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:48,478
Take a big one,
and then we'll share the little ones.

149
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:49,610
Cool !

150
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,853
- You don't want another one, sure?
- Not now.

151
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:53,675
Unbelievable.

152
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:55,677
Joe always has ideas.

153
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,988
Like, "What to build now?"

154
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:02,468
"What great new thing
to build to improve Survivor?"

155
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:04,552
It's crazy
to be in a tribe with Joe,

156
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:06,187
it's the MacGyver of Survivor.

157
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:08,022
He's still making a hammock

158
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,891
or go fishing.

159
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:11,601
We have fish!

160
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,395
There's shrimp on the barbeuc!

161
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:19,175
Joe is too great
for his own good.

162
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,945
He is too "young prodigy",

163
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:23,972
"magnificent threat".

164
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:27,050
Joe is really good at survival.

165
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,918
Joe is the guy

166
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:31,776
who is perfect at the beginning,
wins all the trials,

167
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:34,115
build the shelter,
and then you slit his throat

168
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,110
just before the merger.

169
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,473
- You're fine, huh?
- I'm fine.

170
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:53,576
But I am lucid.
I am not finished.

171
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:56,470
On the council, I had four votes.

172
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:57,605
If I was

173
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,808
the one I was
in Survivor Philippines,

174
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,938
I would have exploded.
But I did not do it.

175
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:05,313
I'm working on it.
I want to change.

176
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:08,358
I'm trying to act like the new Abi
I want to be.

177
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:11,753
How did you make the fireplace,
in China, on the fire?

178
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:14,964
Basically, it protected him
from the wind all around.

179
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:17,947
- It's easy to maintain...
- So, what's up, Peih-Gee?

180
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:19,688
- What ?
- What's new ?

181
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,615
A chimney is built
for the fire.

182
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,759
OK.

183
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:25,241
Seriously, you...

184
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,564
- Seriously, I what?
- Relax.

185
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:30,080
Seriously,
we're building a fireplace.

186
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,773
Abi is the queen of the movies.

187
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:34,214
Having to trust
someone like that

188
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,519
to protect my interests

189
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:39,581
was the scariest thing I had to do in Survivor.

190
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:42,227
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course, everything is fine.

191
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:44,827
I'm just trying
to extend this connection,

192
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:45,954
this friendship

193
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,689
that grows between us.

194
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,191
I feel like I'm well placed

195
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:53,403
but Abi is a permanent risk.

196
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:58,141
She will always be that weight
that must be dragged.

197
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:01,444
Do I interfere,
so they change the subject?

198
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:02,572
Why not ?

199
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:04,658
Let me do.
I will bore them.

200
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,809
Abi is there
to start arguments.

201
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:09,961
It's carcinogenic to the tribe.

202
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:12,113
And fatally carcinogenic
to a wedding ring.

203
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:13,309
Here it is.

204
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,784
Stop! What's new ?

205
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:18,801
- I offered it to you, you didn't come.
- No, I want to participate in the debate.

206
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,819
Abi is a telenovela
on its own,

207
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:23,658
you can turn it on and watch
it at any time.

208
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:27,379
And by tapping on it, you get
various levels of entertainment.

209
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:29,430
What are all these whispers?

210
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:32,000
There are things going on
that you don't need to know about.

211
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,576
- Oh yeah ?
- Oh yeah.

212
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,466
I see in Abi someone
that everyone hates,

213
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:39,140
so someone i can beat.

214
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:41,418
She is the perfect tool

215
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:43,578
to help me win
a million dollars.

216
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:46,648
Follow me all day
and maybe you'll know more.

217
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:49,269
But you won't be able to
run that fast.

218
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:50,460
Parfait.

219
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,420
Oh my God ! I enjoy!

220
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:55,271
Why eat when you have Abi?

221
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:15,176
In my box, in Chicago...

222
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,680
We had Playboy Enterprises
as a client.

223
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:22,990
When I met my wife
and she came to my office,

224
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,929
there were Playboys everywhere.

225
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:29,974
How did you meet her?

226
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:31,359
My wife

227
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:34,891
was a top model in South Africa,
and a law student.

228
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:39,033
She won a beauty contest
whose prize was a trip around the world.

229
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:41,994
She stopped in America

230
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,781
to see my roommate.
They were friends.

231
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:47,061
I come back from a trial, in a suit,

232
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:51,795
and there's the prettiest brunette
I've ever seen,

233
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,248
my house.

234
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:56,660
I almost fainted.

235
00:10:56,785 --> 00:11:00,824
We could have cut
the chemistry between us with a knife,

236
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,124
across the room. Unbelievable.

237
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:05,802
Then
she went to California,

238
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:08,264
then she came back, and...

239
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:17,672
She is everything for me.

240
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:22,401
Oh, goodness!

241
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:29,391
- So she came back.
- She came back.

242
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:31,753
And we were...

243
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:33,628
married...

244
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:35,687
three months later.

245
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,576
- It's awesome.
- Great.

246
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:38,760
Great story.

247
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:41,886
In my first season,
the other contestants were horrible.

248
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:43,873
This time some are great.

249
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:46,121
If they can make me
a better person

250
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:48,103
and a better player, I take.

251
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:49,512
It's so cute.

252
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:52,382
You have to have
feelings in this game.

253
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,455
I made the mistake, the first time,

254
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,253
to consider that everyone
would put feelings aside,

255
00:11:57,378 --> 00:12:00,022
we would play poker
and someone would win.

256
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:03,029
I realized that not everyone
behaves like that here.

257
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:06,129
We are real people.
And I'll be a real person,

258
00:12:06,254 --> 00:12:07,396
all the way.

259
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:18,633
I try to have fun

260
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:20,377
and think professionally.

261
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:23,258
And for Savage to come up with this story
about his wife...

262
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:26,514
It affects you, it makes you think.

263
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:28,749
My wife is pregnant,

264
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,390
and I want to see his belly,
to be there to see him grow.

265
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:38,033
Most...

266
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,568
I won't tell anyone.
I'm exposed enough already.

267
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:45,196
They'll come after me
as a physical threat.

268
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:46,327
If in addition

269
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:49,399
my wife is pregnant,
no one will go through with me.

270
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:52,320
But I have to take it upon myself.

271
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:55,140
Val knows how much this means to me.

272
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:56,337
And for her.

273
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,533
I'm doing this again for her.

274
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:01,838
Where is Jeremy?

275
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:02,966
Pardon ?

276
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:05,280
Should we be worried
about his disappearance?

277
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,646
You don't think
he's looking for idols, do you?

278
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,097
The thing, with Stephen,

279
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,690
it's that he first thinks
Jeremy is looking for an idol.

280
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:18,450
Rather than
"Jeremy has a wonderful family,

281
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:21,496
my story may have affected him
and he needed to isolate himself."

282
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:25,600
It shows me that Fishbach
is in the game 24 hours a day.

283
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:28,638
He thinks only of this idol,
only the game counts.

284
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:29,971
No emotion.

285
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:31,711
Your story, man,

286
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,502
about your wife...

287
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,285
Did that stir you too?

288
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,033
I cried a bit.

289
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:41,096
It's good, it has to come out.

290
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,893
Stephen was asking
if you were looking for an idol.

291
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:47,998
He came to tell you that?

292
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:50,725
It shows what he has in mind.

293
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:54,058
Fishbach is deprived

294
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,864
some of the things
that mean the most to me

295
00:13:56,989 --> 00:13:58,166
and my tribe.

296
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,811
Morals, values,
loyalty, dignity, courage.

297
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:05,682
Whether I like it or not,
its time here,

298
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:08,585
if it depends on me, will be limited.

299
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,532
Dealing with all this craziness...

300
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,979
- Again and again and again...
- Abi?

301
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,815
You had to
babysit, poor thing!

302
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,082
I am...

303
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,866
I railed against her
all day, you have no idea.

304
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:40,513
I asked him to put
these seeds in the rice,

305
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:42,482
and she's like, "I have a bad back.

306
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:44,141
J'arrête, j'ai mal au dos."

307
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:47,243
Elle était posée dans l'abri, à...

308
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,756
J'ai tout entendu.
Pourquoi tu ne me l'as pas dit ?

309
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:53,237
Désolée que tu ne m'aimes pas,
que je t'agace

310
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,942
et que tu ne me supportes pas.

311
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,312
Je n'y peux rien...

312
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,489
Je discute avec Peih-Gee,

313
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,514
Abi la surprend, se pointe,
et ça dégénère

314
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,160
en engueulade.

315
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,783
Abi, tu sais bien
que tu te disputes beaucoup.

316
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:07,231
Avec qui ?

317
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,417
Tu disais à tout le monde
croire que j'avais volé ton bracelet.

318
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,318
Tu parlais dans mon dos.
Comment suis-je censée le prendre ?

319
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:16,983
- Je ne parlais pas dans ton dos.
- Plusieurs personnes me l'ont dit.

320
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,504
Mets-toi à ma place.

321
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:20,913
Comment te sentirais-tu
si ton nom sortait 4 fois ?

322
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:24,482
Abi talks about the votes against her
for the umpteenth time.

323
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:27,747
I was starting to feel bad,
so I left.

324
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:31,589
It was very embarrassing.
Painful to watch.

325
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:34,390
So maybe we got
off on the wrong foot.

326
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,081
Yes, I guess.

327
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:39,169
See, that's it, you do that,
"Oh, whatever..."

328
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,999
What do you want me to tell you ?
You have already made your decision.

329
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:45,301
- What can I say ?
- I can work with anyone.

330
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:48,151
Our friendship is not linked
to a question of numbers.

331
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:50,302
Of course I was a little embarrassed

332
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:53,511
of being caught
talking about someone behind her back.

333
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:56,322
But everyone is fed up with her.

334
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:58,583
She has no friends on this island.

335
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,721
How are you ?

336
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:01,192
It feels good.

337
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:06,780
The people I thought I was allied with

338
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,666
are laughing at me,

339
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,867
and Shirin did not support me.

340
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,965
And I wanted to work with her

341
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,050
because she found that no
one supported her in her season.

342
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,304
I feel really weird here.

343
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,128
It sucks and it hurts.

344
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:25,343
And I feel alone.

345
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,738
And I said, "Calm down."

346
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:31,949
Abi goes to the beach.

347
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,985
There are eight of us in the shelter.

348
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,695
And we laugh at her,

349
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,437
his own allies!

350
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,223
And no one supported her.

351
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:42,009
She's annoying,
and emotionally, it's a disaster.

352
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,923
But there is another human being,
there, struggling.

353
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:46,372
It is not normal.

354
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:50,835
I expected more,
especially from Shirin.

355
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:55,292
You know, Shirin and Spencer
are only there for themselves.

356
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,642
I felt like
they weren't supporting me.

357
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:04,865
So I'm pretty open to...

358
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,553
anything that can protect me.

359
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:09,587
It started

360
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:11,404
to stick well between her and me.

361
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,466
Not only personally,
because we created a bond,

362
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:16,161
but strategically

363
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,184
during the discussion.

364
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,779
Maybe it's just me,
and the "old school" side,

365
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:22,533
but if we move forward together,

366
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:25,036
I will protect you.

367
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:27,180
The opportunity arose

368
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,515
of my compassion for someone.

369
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,009
I'm laying here,

370
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:34,021
all alone.

371
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:35,821
Who came to talk to me?

372
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:37,924
Toi.

373
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:40,217
Jeff lit a fire under my butt.

374
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:42,920
I knew I had to play a social game.

375
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:46,148
I was a little slow on start-up,

376
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,858
but it's starting to take shape.

377
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:04,938
- Did you talk well with Terry?
- Yes.

378
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,877
- He's a good guy, huh?
- Yes.

379
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,080
I plan to join him.

380
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:10,448
Me too.

381
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,524
I want you to stay.
I find you fabulous.

382
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:15,653
Thanks a lot.

383
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,491
I like your little
mood swings. It excites me.

384
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:21,626
What sweet music to my ears!

385
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:26,506
After my allies made me
feel like a fool,

386
00:18:26,991 --> 00:18:29,988
now i feel so good

387
00:18:30,113 --> 00:18:32,702
that people
really want to work with me.

388
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:35,275
And that they actually find me...

389
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:37,208
kidding.

390
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,503
We vote en bloc,

391
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:42,980
and we take out Spencer or Shirin.

392
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,091
I will recruit Terry, Kelley,

393
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:46,958
Woo, you and me, that's five.

394
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,552
- Good.
- That's a majority.

395
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,837
And those who turned their back on you...

396
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:54,685
It will be the big day for them!

397
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:56,294
OK.

398
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,995
Bargain ?

399
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:03,662
Terry saw the opening
and rushed into it.

400
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:05,578
My old allies will regret

401
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,713
for not coming to me

402
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:09,674
when I needed it most.

403
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:36,062
Over here, everyone!

404
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:47,482
Bayon, discover
the new Ta Keo tribe.

405
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:50,488
Vytas, eliminated on the first board.

406
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:54,381
Oh my God !

407
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:57,183
Good. Ready for
today's immunity test?

408
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:58,860
- Oh yeah !
- Yes !

409
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:02,823
Today the two tribes
will pass through a series of pyramids

410
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,691
while carrying spools of rope.

411
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:06,001
With this rope,

412
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:08,762
you will then bring back
a heavy crate on arrival.

413
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:13,653
Two team members will then use
the pieces that are there

414
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,235
to solve a puzzle.

415
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,080
The first tribe to finish...

416
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:21,166
wins immunity,
is immune from voting.

417
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,051
The losers will go to the board

418
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:27,055
where someone will be the 2nd person
eliminated from Second Chance.

419
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,015
Plus, you're playing
for a reward.

420
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,351
- Do you want to know what's at stake?
- Yes sir !

421
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,496
A Survivor Toolkit,

422
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:35,864
pretty cool.

423
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:37,399
Hammer, axe,

424
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:38,869
chisels, saw,

425
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:40,527
bamboo nails, rope,

426
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,696
and as a bonus,
on the camp when you return,

427
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:45,970
materials that will
greatly improve your shelter.

428
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:49,072
It should improve your sleep
and protect you from the rain.

429
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:50,503
Big reward.

430
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:55,658
Bayon, you are one more.
Who will not participate?

431
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:57,176
Who will it be?

432
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,988
- Ciera.
- Ciera won't participate.

433
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:02,391
One more thing.
I forgot to get the idol!

434
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:03,519
Ciera.

435
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:09,089
A 2nd chance for me
to do this properly.

436
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,959
Once again,
immunity is at stake.

437
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:15,959
- Ciera, take a seat on the bench.
- OK.

438
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,365
The others, one minute
to get organized and here we go.

439
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:29,873
Let's go. For immunity
and reward,

440
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,111
Survivors, ready?

441
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:33,809
Go !

442
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:36,160
You must cross this first wall.

443
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:37,392
Go on !

444
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:39,953
Cheer ! Help each other!

445
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,553
Bayon flies over the obstacle.

446
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:47,743
Ta Keo takes longer.

447
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:51,150
Slipping on this wood
will leave traces!

448
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,935
Bayon took the lead.

449
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,768
On the 2nd wall, everyone, forward!

450
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:00,848
This one will take more effort.

451
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,318
Help each other! Cheer !

452
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:05,312
- Its good.
- Go on !

453
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:09,149
At each stage,
you have to wait for everyone.

454
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,885
It's not good for the skin!

455
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,929
Big fall for Varner!

456
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,224
Go ahead, Bayon!
Go ahead, Ta Keo!

457
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:18,485
Bravo !

458
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,491
Climb on me.

459
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:22,871
This will be the most difficult wall.

460
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:25,031
It will require a lot
of teamwork.

461
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:27,422
Use rope if necessary.

462
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:30,078
lots of skin

463
00:22:30,203 --> 00:22:31,718
remained on this wood.

464
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:34,282
That's why you're here.

465
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:36,443
For a 2nd chance in this game.

466
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:41,248
Monica loses more skin.

467
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,925
It will leave wounds,

468
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,785
in addition to some big falls.

469
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:49,122
Very big fall of Savage!

470
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:53,593
Go ! Go !

471
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,330
Four people on the crate,
the other five on the carpet.

472
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,874
Come on !

473
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:00,742
Give it your all, you're in on it!

474
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,823
You have to tie these strings together.

475
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,938
With the rope,
you will pull the crate.

476
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:07,349
Perfect equality for the moment.

477
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,486
Let's go, the two tribes shoot.

478
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:12,612
Give it all!

479
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:18,460
This box is very heavy.

480
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:19,953
Legs now!

481
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:22,697
Spencer, Woo,

482
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:24,124
Deitz and Varner

483
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:25,519
are stuck.

484
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,669
Give it all!

485
00:23:29,163 --> 00:23:30,497
Bayon has arrived!

486
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:32,966
To the puzzle team!
All the others, on the carpet!

487
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:36,478
It's good, it's good! Go on !

488
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:38,872
Ta Keo is very late.

489
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:42,442
Kass and Kimmy
are on the puzzle for Bayon.

490
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,097
That's it !
Onward, puzzle team!

491
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:50,325
Big lead for Kimmy and Kass.

492
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,462
But are they on the right track?

493
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:57,324
If correct, each piece
will be connected to the next.

494
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:58,467
Parfait.

495
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,001
Kelly Wentworth

496
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:02,229
and the Peih-Gee s'attant au puzzle.

497
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:05,232
Can they make up
for lost time on checkout?

498
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:06,566
immunity

499
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:08,468
and a big in-game reward.

500
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:09,978
Anyone want to retire?

501
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:11,110
You go-y !

502
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:13,562
Spencer gets involved.
He hopes to make a difference.

503
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:15,128
Can he pick up the pace?

504
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,143
- Can he close the gap?
- Its good !

505
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:19,872
The one that is already there,
with the one on the right.

506
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:22,782
Too much communication
can create chaos and confusion.

507
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:25,427
- Nope ! The following !
- Not here !

508
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:26,555
The following !

509
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,589
All of the Ta Keo
are screaming at Spencer and Peih-Gee.

510
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:31,691
Joe will replace Kimmy.

511
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:34,080
He thinks he knows what to do.

512
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:37,697
Jeremy replaces Kass.
He had time to study it.

513
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:39,165
Want me to go?

514
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,701
- Yeah, go ahead.
- It's Shirin and Spencer now.

515
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:44,274
Shirin takes orders
and moves pieces.

516
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,449
No stop !
Oh, my God, I can't do it!

517
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:49,209
Panic sets in.

518
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,577
It's a nightmare.

519
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:52,012
I'm going to faint.

520
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:55,538
There is only one way
to solve this puzzle.

521
00:24:55,663 --> 00:24:57,751
So everything lines up.

522
00:24:57,876 --> 00:25:01,426
The drawing will flow
from one piece to the next.

523
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:02,956
If it doesn't follow,

524
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:04,286
it's wrong.

525
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:08,100
Spencer begins to move forward,
with a new idea.

526
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:09,229
Is he right ?

527
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:10,539
Go on ! Go on !

528
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:13,033
Spencer and Shirin keep
making changes.

529
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:15,308
Yes Spencer! Yes !

530
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:19,314
It would be a spectacular comeback
for Ta Keo.

531
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:21,582
Joe moves pieces now.

532
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:24,052
He has his idea about their position.

533
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,455
Both tribes
move pieces very fast

534
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,256
and try to come to a conclusion.

535
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:30,617
But are they right this time?

536
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:33,253
This here! This here! Yes !

537
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:35,121
It's the final sprint!

538
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:38,834
Put it here!

539
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,819
- Its good !
- Yes ! Yes !

540
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:44,397
The Ta Keos think they have it.

541
00:25:49,836 --> 00:25:51,213
It is not fair !

542
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:53,607
Jeff !

543
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:55,617
The Bayons think they have it.

544
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:00,756
Bayon is right!

545
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:02,457
Immunity and reward

546
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:06,052
for Bayon,
who returns Ta Keo to the council!

547
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:10,123
Bayon!

548
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:11,273
Bayon!

549
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,600
Bayon, congratulations,

550
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:22,335
immunity again!

551
00:26:26,258 --> 00:26:28,115
No advice tonight, Bayon.

552
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,876
No one will leave your tribe.

553
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:33,079
Plus, a nice reward.
Come get it, have a good night!

554
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,796
- Thank you, Jeff.
- I needed a saw.

555
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:44,925
Ta Keo, I did for you

556
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,468
just a date with me,

557
00:26:46,593 --> 00:26:48,503
tonight, at the council,
where someone will be

558
00:26:48,628 --> 00:26:50,664
the 2nd person eliminated
from Second Chance.

559
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,458
Take your things, return to camp.
See you tonight at the council.

560
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,459
This event was a nightmare,
and we lost.

561
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,813
But, I hadn't realized it
until now:

562
00:26:58,938 --> 00:27:02,012
Spencer and Shirin had
their destiny in their hands, and they lost it.

563
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,887
Now, one of the two
is going to leave tonight.

564
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,014
What a fair return of things!

565
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:33,040
- Good effort, friends.
- Exhausting!

566
00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:35,449
Sorry for the end,
but you made it happen.

567
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:36,639
Do not worry.

568
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:39,815
- It was rough.
- Everyone did their best.

569
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,832
It's been two events
where we get our ass kicked.

570
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:47,663
I'm happy
to control the game with Shirin.

571
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,687
I rely on her more
than anyone here.

572
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:55,003
My old experience of Survivor,
drooling at the bottom of the ladder,

573
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:57,735
without having anyone to play with

574
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,595
and who to trust, is far behind.

575
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:07,138
- Did you get rubbed in the sand?
- Nope.

576
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:09,408
- Do it !
- You'll feel much better!

577
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:11,849
- Alright, if you want.
- Yeah.

578
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:13,567
I'll rub you, if you want.

579
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,312
My trick is to eliminate
threats as soon as possible.

580
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:19,490
Spencer is a huge
strategic threat.

581
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,585
He's the smartest young man
I've ever met.

582
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:26,867
Shirin is the same,
plus she's sensitive,

583
00:28:26,992 --> 00:28:30,193
she talks to you like you're
best friends, she's a saleswoman.

584
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:32,351
They are two heads
of the same serpent.

585
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:34,330
So it doesn't matter which one we cut.

586
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:37,209
Would you vote
for Shirin or Spencer?

587
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:39,035
To end it.

588
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:42,580
You know what ?
I will follow the majority.

589
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:45,707
I would prefer to eliminate Abi-Maria,

590
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:47,110
but for now,

591
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:49,831
I will follow the majority,

592
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:53,282
which appears to be everyone
except Shirin and Spencer.

593
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:55,718
They are both dangerous.

594
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:58,796
I wouldn't want to be
on the wrong side of the vote.

595
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:03,659
I'll tell you.

596
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:04,995
This tribe...

597
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:07,639
It's the mess.

598
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:09,882
The total mess!
Abi is devastated.

599
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,635
That Shirin
didn't support her last night.

600
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,480
Terry Deitz stayed
with her all night, like a father.

601
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:17,872
When she woke up, she was
totally loyal to him.

602
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:19,242
So where are we?

603
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:22,723
- Toi, Peih-Gee, Wigs, Deitz, Woo ...
- Tout le monde sauf Shirin ...

604
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,514
- OK.
- ...and Spencer.

605
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,357
- Yeah.
- It's finish.

606
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:28,630
- If you're up for it.
- I'm.

607
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:31,478
- Don't go straight into the woods!
- But no.

608
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,694
You won't see me talking
to Shirin today.

609
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:34,824
Promis.

610
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:36,283
It's very hard for me,

611
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,392
to consider voting
for Shirin or Spencer.

612
00:29:38,517 --> 00:29:40,029
They are my original allies.

613
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:44,610
Alas, things changed
in the space of 24 hours.

614
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:47,660
I find myself
in another covenant,

615
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:51,007
which I don't necessarily like,
but I have to go with the flow.

616
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:55,800
And so, Shirin and Spencer
are in deep shit.

617
00:30:05,796 --> 00:30:09,993
Even if we lost the race,
I see the future with optimism,

618
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:14,739
car on a moi, Spencer,
Kelley, Jeff Varner...

619
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:18,105
But I want to make sure
Abi still feels good.

620
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,096
It always goes
in all directions.

621
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:27,577
- How do you feel today ?
- Good.

622
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,275
I feel good today.

623
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm sorry about last night.

624
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,927
- Sorry for not supporting you.
- I regret.

625
00:30:36,052 --> 00:30:37,526
'Cause I'm loyal

626
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:40,306
and if I give my word
to a covenant,

627
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:42,473
it's 100%.

628
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:45,828
I expected one of you to
come see me.

629
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:48,255
Who came ? Terri.

630
00:30:53,162 --> 00:30:55,581
Terry came to spend
two hours with me.

631
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:56,857
Two o'clock.

632
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,977
I'm sorry.

633
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,575
I tried, Shirin. I tried.

634
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,050
I tried to support you,
but you know what?

635
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:07,850
If you fuck me, you're dead.

636
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,747
You left me there,
all alone.

637
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:13,501
Abi, I gave you my word,
I voted with you.

638
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:15,014
What more can I do?

639
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,867
I was crying in front of you.
We got off on my head.

640
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,174
I was like,
"That's really weird."

641
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,031
Varner and Kelley are in on it.

642
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:24,434
They want to eliminate you
and Spencer.

643
00:31:28,126 --> 00:31:29,572
Are we still together?

644
00:31:36,122 --> 00:31:37,889
No. It's not my type.

645
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,752
Spencer and I
were in the majority

646
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:44,235
qui a sorti Vytas.

647
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,465
We should have the wind in our sails,
be happy...

648
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:51,793
But, I don't know how,
we find ourselves in the minority.

649
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,001
We are fucked.

650
00:31:58,302 --> 00:31:59,987
OK. Can you explain?

651
00:32:00,112 --> 00:32:02,116
In a nutshell:

652
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:04,834
Varner and Abi will vote
with the old school.

653
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:11,280
For the moment, I oscillate
between frustration and exasperation.

654
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,945
Until a minute ago,
everything was fine for me.

655
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,762
And now
my #1 priority is to protect myself.

656
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:23,559
My priority must be
to last three more days.

657
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:30,500
Woo, I want to talk to you.

658
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:31,901
This is what happens to you.

659
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:33,936
If you stick with the old school,

660
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:36,162
they will keep you for the trials.

661
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:40,652
But you will be at the bottom of the ladder.
And if by chance you reach fusion,

662
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:44,180
you will be the most dangerous,
and you will jump at the first opportunity.

663
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:47,759
All of a sudden, Spencer and Shirin

664
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:51,608
have the nerve to think
that I'm going to betray my tribe

665
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:52,787
and join them.

666
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:55,183
Hey, sorry! The majority commands.

667
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:57,846
- Not that I don't trust.
- You do not know me...

668
00:32:57,971 --> 00:33:00,563
But this is the first time
you've spoken to me.

669
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:01,698
I say.

670
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:03,469
I always keep my word.

671
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:05,368
I am sick

672
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:10,114
at the thought that I could leave

673
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:13,109
and that my only option
is to vote for Spencer.

674
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:16,245
I don't want to vote for Spencer.

675
00:33:16,584 --> 00:33:18,642
I will accept any deal.

676
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,583
It's just that it amazes me

677
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:23,086
that not once
have you taken me aside.

678
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,155
And now
you come to ask me for a vote.

679
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:29,034
I'll just answer you...

680
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:30,668
Never.

681
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,767
My situation continues to darken.

682
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:42,022
It was to be my 2nd chance,
I wanted a different experience.

683
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:45,984
But I'm hard taken back
to my first experience,

684
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:48,467
where everything starts very well

685
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:51,147
then suddenly collapses
before my eyes.

686
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:56,482
Everyone here, except for Shirin and me,

687
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:59,345
is in the majority, against us.

688
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:02,375
Shirin is my only strong ally.

689
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:07,074
And now
I'm afraid I have no other choice

690
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:11,560
than screwing up the only person
I wanted to play with.

691
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,880
So, Varner, how's the vibe
in the tribe right now?

692
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:51,974
We are all exhausted.

693
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:54,954
This day cost us a lot.

694
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,950
This ordeal was intense.

695
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:58,289
Spencer.

696
00:34:58,414 --> 00:35:00,800
It's one thing to want to play again.

697
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:02,126
But once here

698
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:04,454
you remember:
"Oh, yeah! We bite!"

699
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:09,234
Yes. There is a form of amnesia,
regardless of the time elapsed

700
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,965
since the 1st participation.

701
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,569
Then you come back, and you 're like,
"No, that sucks!

702
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,260
We're going to taste!"

703
00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:17,780
Shirin, Spencer's comments
are interesting.

704
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:21,170
We have a great memory of Survivor,
until we come back.

705
00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:24,207
I don't have such good memories of it.

706
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:26,184
I had it the first time.

707
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:28,211
Et...

708
00:35:28,688 --> 00:35:31,990
It's starting to happen again.

709
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,316
Déjà ?

710
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:34,784
Yeah, already.

711
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:36,085
Tell me about it.

712
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,754
There were arguments.

713
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:40,837
Some people
no longer trust me.

714
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:43,209
I believe I am at the bottom of the scale.

715
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:44,869
And I hope I can fight

716
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:46,427
and find my place.

717
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:48,806
Kelley, what is Shirin talking about?

718
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:50,742
Was there a big fight?

719
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,377
There was a disagreement

720
00:35:52,502 --> 00:35:54,779
between Abi and Peih-Gee.

721
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:57,279
I believe this is
what Shirin is talking about.

722
00:35:57,601 --> 00:35:59,642
So, Abi, what was it?

723
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:02,620
I was sitting on the beach,
and Peih-Gee

724
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,390
and Shirin were talking about me.

725
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:07,350
I felt betrayed,

726
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:10,026
in a way, because we were allies.

727
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,666
And I'm very gracious
to Terry.

728
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,701
He is the only one

729
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:20,104
to have rescued me
when I felt very alone,

730
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:23,841
when I thought I would be unanimously eliminated
tonight.

731
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:28,504
Shirin, that's almost verbatim
what you said in your season.

732
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:31,683
You said of Mike
that he was the only one to rescue you.

733
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:33,532
Abi said it about Terry.

734
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:36,494
But in this case, it was you
who hurt him.

735
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:40,149
It's true, I should have supported her,
gone to see her right away.

736
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:42,785
I didn't, and...

737
00:36:43,593 --> 00:36:45,363
The game changes very quickly.

738
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:48,430
- Deitz, you nod.
- Yeah.

739
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:50,126
Because I was at the bottom of the ladder

740
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,787
two days ago.

741
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,339
And because of this story,

742
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,341
Abi ended up on the beach,

743
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:57,967
and we developed a bond.

744
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,945
It wasn't
just a strategy thing,

745
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,007
just to develop relationships,
and a lot of good has come from that.

746
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:08,544
So much so that I don't think I'm
at the bottom of the ladder anymore.

747
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:13,224
spencer. Shirin thinks of herself
as the very bottom of the ladder.

748
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,986
Is it the consensus
she has to worry about?

749
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,253
Well yes.

750
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:19,522
No need to beat around the bush.

751
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:22,300
I am also worried.

752
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:24,171
Why would you be targeted tonight?

753
00:37:24,296 --> 00:37:25,904
There are several reasons,

754
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:28,439
but among other things,
because I talk too much about strategy

755
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:31,509
and not enough to get
to know these people.

756
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:34,045
Jeff, Shirin et Spencer

757
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,713
are they right to be concerned?

758
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,241
Have you narrowed the choice down
to these two?

759
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,551
Oui.

760
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,266
- Spencer, it's confirmed.
- 100 %.

761
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:47,835
No need to speak in code.
It will be one of us tonight.

762
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,352
But know it,

763
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:52,037
Wiglesworth, Terry, Peih-Gee,

764
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:54,999
Jeff, Abi, Woo et Kelley,

765
00:37:55,124 --> 00:37:56,459
if I'm here tomorrow,

766
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,260
this change will happen.

767
00:37:58,385 --> 00:37:59,395
It's not :

768
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,606
"I create an alliance here
and another there."

769
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:04,701
It's about creating human connections,
forming relationships

770
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:06,411
who have basics.

771
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:08,671
That's what I will do now.

772
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:11,093
OK ? And I mean it.

773
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,378
It's incredible.

774
00:38:13,503 --> 00:38:16,354
The two people in danger,
Shirin and Spencer,

775
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:20,083
live very similar stories
to their first times.

776
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,972
Spencer, you had almost
the same speech in your season,

777
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,722
"I will work with whoever wants to,
give me a chance."

778
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:28,192
And Shirin, you were
at the center of a controversy,

779
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:31,002
excluded on one side or the other.

780
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:32,512
What do you think, Shirin?

781
00:38:32,637 --> 00:38:36,475
What lesson to take away from this,
about the ability to change,

782
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,668
or on the situations
in which we put ourselves

783
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:40,378
again and again ?

784
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,538
Change is difficult.

785
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:45,625
It's a second chance
to correct the situation.

786
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,208
That doesn't mean we're going to change
overnight.

787
00:38:49,512 --> 00:38:51,047
I made real mistakes.

788
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:52,515
If I leave tonight

789
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:54,287
it's my fault.

790
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:55,685
I'm responsible.

791
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,396
If I don't leave tonight,
if I stay,

792
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:00,256
it will be a 3rd chance.

793
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,759
It only happens once.

794
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:07,630
Good. It's time to vote.

795
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:09,719
Wiglesworth, over.

796
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:41,164
I know you write my name too.

797
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,778
I have nothing negative
to say about you.

798
00:39:58,047 --> 00:39:59,716
I will count the votes.

799
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:11,982
If anyone has an immunity idol
and wants to play it,

800
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:14,225
now is the time to do it.

801
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,797
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

802
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:23,272
The eliminated person
will leave the council immediately.

803
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:24,841
I will read the votes.

804
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:28,400
First vote.

805
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:29,848
Spencer.

806
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:32,783
Shirin.

807
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:36,261
Shirin.

808
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:39,155
Shirin.

809
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,765
Three Shirin votes.

810
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,334
Spencer.

811
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:47,272
spencer.
Three votes Spencer,

812
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:48,528
three votes Shirin.

813
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,869
spencer.
Four votes Spencer,

814
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:54,979
three votes Shirin.

815
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,611
Shirin.
New equality.

816
00:40:57,736 --> 00:40:59,942
Four votes Shirin,
four votes Spencer,

817
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,244
one vote remains.

818
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:07,188
Second person eliminated
from Survivor Second Chance...

819
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:10,128
Shirin.

820
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:11,863
Bring me your torch.

821
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:17,582
Make them drool!

822
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:25,476
Shirin, the tribe has spoken.

823
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:28,974
It's time to go.

824
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,416
I was sincere. Thank you.

825
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,561
This season

826
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:45,330
offer a 2nd chance

827
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:47,957
to change what didn't work
the first time.

828
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:51,936
But if you don't change,
history is bound to repeat itself.

829
00:41:52,186 --> 00:41:54,215
Take your torches,
return to camp.

830
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,565
Good night.

Stay with us, to see
a preview of the next episode.

836
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,225
Next time in Survivor...

837
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:20,261
In a season
where adaptation is key...

838
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:22,563
If you are unable to change,

839
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:23,805
it's death.

840
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,392
...everyone has
to be ready for change.

841
00:42:26,517 --> 00:42:29,103
Throw away your bandanas.
We change the tribes.

842
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,105
Of two tribes...

843
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:32,673
to three tribes.

844
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:34,467
Oh my God !

845
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,736
I failed to take
my second chance.

846
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:47,622
I struggled to change
key aspects to make it work.

847
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:50,862
I was in a very good position

848
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:54,619
until I freak out
and destroy my game.

849
00:42:54,744 --> 00:42:57,381
I started with a bang, and then...

850
00:42:58,463 --> 00:42:59,730
I committed suicide.
