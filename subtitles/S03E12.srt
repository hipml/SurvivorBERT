1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,252
- Previously on
<i>Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,463
The members of Moto Maji were
weak and hungry.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,090
- Do we want the mush or do we
want the gruel this morning?

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,300
- Lex was on shaky
ground with his alliance.

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,094
- Lex gave his word
to Brandon,

6
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,264
but he gave
his word to us, also.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,725
He kind of went out on his own
and covered his own ass.

8
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,145
- From here on out,
I have a question with Lex.

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,438
- But Lex guaranteed
himself

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,898
three more days by winning
immunity.

11
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:24,315
Lex wins immunity.

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,776
- Good job, Lex.

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,278
- Back at camp,
Frank spoke his mind

14
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,571
a little too bluntly.

15
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,448
- These little liberal
special interest groups

16
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,241
that the media
give open market to,

17
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,243
instead of the average
working-class American

18
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,244
that founded this country...

19
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,620
- Okay, enough!
All right, enough.

20
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,289
- Today is
Tribal Council day.

21
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,166
You don't want to really
ruffle any feathers.

22
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,918
- At Tribal Council,
Frank paid for his opinions.

23
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,087
Even Teresa
voted against him.

24
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,922
Only six remain.

25
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,507
Tonight,
the stakes grow higher

26
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,135
as one more is voted
out of the tribe.

27
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,764
(singing in native language)

28
00:00:55,847 --> 00:01:03,772
♪♪

29
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,294
- Kill time
making a bracelet.

30
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,881
- Cool.
That has holes in it?

31
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,343
- I made that.
That slip was through.

32
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,513
It was all, like, strategically
kind of placed.

33
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,558
- I'm surrounded by people I
enjoy, but yet I'm so alone.

34
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,103
You are so alone, because they
are your friends, but, you know,

35
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,521
I only met them
a month ago.

36
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,231
- As tight as you can
on it.

37
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,440
- You know,
I hold back a lot.

38
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,610
You know, I don't reveal
everything about myself.

39
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,071
Even though I'm surrounded by
people all the time,

40
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,241
I still feel so alone.

41
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:43,580
- You've got mail.
- Oh, a diary.

42
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,208
- This could be huge, guys.
- All right.

43
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:54,132
- All right, and it reads,
"You think you know them

44
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:58,845
"and that they know you.

45
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:05,018
"It's time to find out
if that really is true.

46
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:12,150
"For the winner, a prize
that takes you away,

47
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:19,157
but that is just the beginning
of an unforgettable day."

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,950
- Cool!

49
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,119
- I think it's a fair guess
that, um,

50
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,079
this challenge is
early, because, we...

51
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,956
whoever wins is going on
a trip today.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,458
- Oh, God.

53
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,264
- Well, seeing as how
you guys have been away

54
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,850
for over a month,
I figure you got to be

55
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,852
missing the loved ones
a little bit.

56
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,104
So I called them up
and asked them

57
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,314
to put together
a little greeting.

58
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,149
- Oh, my God.
- Which may also help you

59
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,068
to get to know your
tribe mates a little better.

60
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,820
Miss Johnson,
you're up first.

61
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,823
- We have two pieces of news--
good news and bad news.

62
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,283
The good news is, we're still
getting married.

63
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,326
The invitations
are going out.

64
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,827
The bad news is
that you are not here

65
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,578
and that we miss you
dearly.

66
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:10,166
- Hi, Kippy.
- I miss you, Mom.

67
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,834
- Hope you are doing okay.

68
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,045
- It's tough surviving around
here without you.

69
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,548
Love you, and we hope above all,
you are having a ball.

70
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,843
See you soon.

71
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,346
- Isn't he so cool?
Thank you.

72
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,182
- Does something like
that give you the strength

73
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,393
to go on or make you
think, "I got to get home"?

74
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,519
- I think they are
rooting for me so much,

75
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,188
and we're so close
to the end now,

76
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,399
that it does give me
the strength to go on.

77
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,068
- All right, Miss Cooper.
- Oh, God.

78
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,195
- Hi, Teresa,
you remember us?

79
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,697
We are your family
in Jackson, Georgia.

80
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,698
We miss you.

81
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,992
- I been marking off my
calendar.

82
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:44,826
Mommy and I are
praying for you.

83
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,869
I miss you.
- I miss you, too, baby.

84
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,496
- I've been marking off
my calendar

85
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,374
and I've been sleeping
with my monkey bed.

86
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,168
And I love you.
That's all I wanted to say.

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,587
- Hi, T-Bird!
- Hey, Daddy.

88
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,673
- I love you, honey--
do good.

89
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,799
We'll see you
when you come back.

90
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,801
We'll be waiting on you.
- Bye, T.

91
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,261
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye, Mom!

92
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,721
- Bye, babies.

93
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,389
- It's great, that's great.

94
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,725
- Ethan.
- All right.

95
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,562
- Your turn.
- Hi, Ethan, honey.

96
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,230
We just finished
eating dinner,

97
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:17,567
and we are having
a little trouble.

98
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,403
- They're drunk.

99
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,614
- We're sitting
on the couch.

100
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,783
- My mom is drunk.

101
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,910
- We like having a one-way
conversation with you

102
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,412
when you
can't talk back,

103
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,416
and we love you
and good luck, kid.

104
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,251
- Oh, that's so cool.

105
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,712
- Big Tom,
you are up, fellow.

106
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,590
- Goat's about to eat us up
here on the golf cart.

107
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,091
We are taking care of them.

108
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,887
I bet the big guy's been
playing a little golf,

109
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,929
chasing a little
beaver.

110
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,266
You know, same old stuff.
Over and out, big guy.

111
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,226
Kick some ass.

112
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,104
- Hey, Tom, I sure do miss you
around here.

113
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,317
Had a lot of time, so I've been
riding this old stud here

114
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,444
since
I don't have one at home.

115
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,071
We do miss you
and everything is going fine.

116
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,531
We look forward
to having you back.

117
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,075
I love you
and we'll see you later.

118
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,451
Bye-bye.

119
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,454
- See, they don't have any more
control over the goats

120
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,914
than you did.

121
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,290
(laughter)

122
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,918
- All right, Powers.

123
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,836
- I miss you more every day.

124
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,296
- Oh, my God.

125
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,672
- Sometimes I just have to call
your voice mail

126
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,759
so I can hear your voice.

127
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:30,473
I know that you are fine, and I
know you are doing real well.

128
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,683
Love you lots.
Have fun.

129
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,728
Enjoy.
Remember how much I love you.

130
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,274
- Nice.

131
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,276
- You can tell
as your mom--

132
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,112
the reason
it stops and starts,

133
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,656
she couldn't stop crying
either.

134
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,366
She didn't want anyone to see
her crying,

135
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,784
so she kept stopping
the tape.

136
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,287
- Obviously,
I take after her.

137
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,164
- Are you okay?
You are shaking.

138
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,958
- I'm good.
- It's a good shake.

139
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,542
- Yeah, it's a good shake.
It's good.

140
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,128
I'm good.
- Okay.

141
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,504
Lex, want to hear
from your family?

142
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,839
- I do.

143
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,840
- Hi, Daddy.

144
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:09,178
- I love you so much--
I love you more than...

145
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,639
ice cream.

146
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:15,685
- I miss you and
I love you very much.

147
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,689
- Hi, honey-- the minute I saw
you, I fell in love with you.

148
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,400
I can't wait
to see you again

149
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,195
and give you a big hug
and kiss you and, you know.

150
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,530
(laughter)

151
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,740
See you soon.
- You rock, Dad!

152
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,242
- Oh!

153
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,202
- I think that is one
of the most romantic things

154
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,495
I have ever heard--

155
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,539
"the moment I met you,
I knew I loved you."

156
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,583
- This is the best reward.

157
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,712
I mean, this was the best--
seeing that was everything.

158
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,547
Thank you.
- Good.

159
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,215
All right,
so we figured we had

160
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,758
your families there with
the video camera going.

161
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:53,222
Might as well involve them in
our next reward challenge.

162
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,559
So we asked your family members
four questions about you.

163
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,769
Whoever gets the most answers
right wins the reward.

164
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,063
The winner of today's
reward challenge

165
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,398
will leave here
immediately.

166
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,025
You'll be flown
to the Masai Mara,

167
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,693
where you will watch
the migration of the wildebeest,

168
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,237
one of the most
spectacular things

169
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,406
you'll ever see
in your life.

170
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:15,328
You'll then go to a safari
resort tonight.

171
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,581
You'll have a real bed.
You'll have a real shower.

172
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,124
You'll have real food.

173
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,293
You'll get up in the morning,
private balloon ride.

174
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,669
- What?

175
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,714
- And you're gonna pay for it
with my own personal Visa.

176
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,467
(cheering)

177
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,554
So first question,
we asked your family member:

178
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,848
What is your most
embarrassing moment?

179
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,108
So, Kim, you are up first.

180
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,236
- Throwing up on you on our
second date.

181
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,820
- Okay, let's see what
he said.

182
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,990
- You might ask her what
happened on our second date,

183
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,452
but I'll use
a different answer.

184
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,787
Kim disappeared
for about two hours

185
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,957
and she did fall asleep
on the toilet

186
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,833
and blocked the
bathroom for all that time.

187
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,335
- Shoot.

188
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,795
- He had it and then he
went with something else.

189
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,298
If you miss the Masai Mara by
one question...

190
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,801
- I'll throw up on him again.

191
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,803
- Teresa.

192
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,513
- New York marathon injury.

193
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,266
It took me about all day
and night to finish.

194
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,685
- Spilling
a full tray of drinks

195
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,646
on first-class
passengers.

196
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,856
- God.
- Ethan.

197
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,692
- It was-- I was
doing my hair for prom

198
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,986
and the curling iron
got stuck

199
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,488
and my mom had to
cut my hair off.

200
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,198
- All right.
We'll see what she said.

201
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:38,494
- That would be letting in
an easy goal

202
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,787
in a very important
soccer game.

203
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,123
- All right, Tom, show us your
most embarrassing moment.

204
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:46,294
- I was walking around in dirty
underwear in the house,

205
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,670
and there was people
in the kitchen.

206
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,715
I walked in the kitchen
and met these people

207
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,883
and I had a little stain
in my underwear.

208
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,179
- You can't embarrass him.
He doesn't give a hoot.

209
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,723
He just doesn't care, so I
can't give you an answer

210
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:03,019
because I don't think Tom
has ever been embarrassed.

211
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,520
- All right, Kim.

212
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,855
- I kept falling off
my bike in a race.

213
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,982
I was doing a triathlon

214
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,526
and my bathing suit got
caught in my bike seat

215
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,527
as I tried to
pick my bike up.

216
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,030
All the other racers
got a really good view.

217
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,157
- Her most embarrassing moment
was when she wiped out

218
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,741
during a triathlon.

219
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,368
- Yes, Mom, yes!

220
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,703
- Couldn't get
her bike turned around

221
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,912
and her bathing suit
even got stuck in her bike.

222
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,165
- All right!
Yes, Mom!

223
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,877
Yes!
- Good job!

224
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,670
- All right, Lex, most
embarrassing moment.

225
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,921
- Back in college, I used to go
to a lot of happy hours.

226
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,507
One time, I got a little too
happy.

227
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,261
I threw up in the middle of my
human sexuality class.

228
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,722
- That would be in college
when he threw up

229
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,557
all over the other
students.

230
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,893
- Yes.
- There it is.

231
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,228
- That's my wife.
Love her.

232
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,271
- Okay, after the first
round,

233
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,775
Lex and Kim Powers,
up one and one.

234
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,236
- Next question--
what physical trait

235
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,864
do you least like
about yourself?

236
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,741
- I think he'll say my feet.

237
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:03,537
- It will be her feet.
- Oh, baby.

238
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,082
- I have straight,
stringy see-through hair.

239
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,417
- I would have to say that
would be her nose.

240
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,128
- Baby!

241
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,421
- Well, I hate to admit it,

242
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,798
but this is my family
answering for me,

243
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,217
and they probably think
I said I have none.

244
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,096
- Your legs.
- What?

245
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,932
- I'm going to say hair
because I would love this--

246
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,975
if I could grow it over,
I'd have it down to my feet.

247
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,604
- He used to say he was a heck
of a man when he had hair.

248
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,607
So, lack of hair.
- Good job, Big Tom.

249
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,858
- Could have gone two ways, but
I'm going to say small chest.

250
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,444
- It's her arms.

251
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,114
- Oh, God, Mom,
where did you get that?

252
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,991
- My nose.
- The hair on his back, sorry.

253
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,745
- What?

254
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,789
You can take a look-- I think
I got about six of them.

255
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,166
- All right, after two
rounds, here is where we are at.

256
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,960
Kim Johnson has one.
Big Tom has one.

257
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,296
Young Kim has one,
and Lex has one.

258
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,132
Teresa and Ethan, you guys got
to get on the board.

259
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,633
Here's the third question.

260
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,219
What will your family members
say is your biggest fear?

261
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,470
Biggest fear?

262
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,765
- Growing old and not being
able to do what I want to do.

263
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,767
- She is really pretty
fearless,

264
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,477
but she is scared
of bungee jumping.

265
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,979
- Wrong track.

266
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,981
- My greatest fear
and probably only fear

267
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,692
is loss of a loved one.

268
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,985
- Only one I can think of
is maybe snakes.

269
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,821
- Snakes?

270
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,866
- I think it's a fear of
throwing up.

271
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,325
- Vomiting.

272
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,994
- Yeah!

273
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,329
Woo.

274
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,498
- On the Mom.
- Okay, Big Tom.

275
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,667
- She will say none.

276
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,836
- It's always
in every parent's mind

277
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,298
about their children,
so his biggest fear

278
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,467
would be that something
would happen to his son.

279
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,052
- Hard to argue with that.
- Yes, it is.

280
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,638
- She's got to get this one--
spiders.

281
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,141
- Her biggest fear is being
unfulfilled.

282
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,976
- Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

283
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,145
- Wow, that's deep.
- Lex.

284
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,855
- Outliving
either of my sons.

285
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,106
Losing one of my boys.

286
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,024
- Something happening
to me or the kids.

287
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,735
- That'll work.
- Thanks, honey.

288
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,196
- Okay, Lex is in the lead
with two.

289
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,992
Kim Johnson, Kim Powers, Ethan
and Tom each have one.

290
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,035
Teresa, this is the last
question.

291
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,370
Since there is no way
you can win,

292
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,539
we'll leave you out of
this one.

293
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,874
What is your greatest
achievement?

294
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,502
- I said my family.

295
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,046
I've been married very
happily for 37 years,

296
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,422
and I have three
great kids.

297
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,090
And not having any family
of my own before that,

298
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,051
it just doesn't
get any better than this.

299
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:27,056
- I think her answer would be
a really great family,

300
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,682
three great kids.

301
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,892
- Very nice.
- Three grandchildren.

302
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,394
- Yay, yay.
- Okay, Ethan.

303
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,190
- Mine will probably have to be
playing professional soccer.

304
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:40,194
- Taking the high school soccer
team to the state tournament

305
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,111
as a starting freshman.

306
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,365
- Like I've done nothing
after high school.

307
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,076
(laughter)

308
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,703
- Big Tom, the minute I
asked this question,

309
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,829
you didn't hesitate.

310
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,374
You wrote three letters down.
I can tell from here.

311
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:57,086
- My son.
You don't have to play it.

312
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,880
She knows that is my greatest
accomplishment.

313
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,175
- Tom's greatest achievement
would be his son, Beau.

314
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,220
- Yeah!

315
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,846
- Got that.
- Kim.

316
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,765
- This is strange, but I said
calling off my wedding

317
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,141
at the last minute.
- Hmm.

318
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:15,104
- Kim's greatest achievement
was her solo trip to Europe.

319
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,939
- All right, Lex,
get this right,

320
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,567
you're on your way
to the Masai Mara.

321
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,444
If you don't, you are
in a three-way tie.

322
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,654
What did you say?

323
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:27,408
- Like Big Tom, I have no
doubt, my two beautiful sons,

324
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,451
crowning achievement.

325
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,830
- What is Lex's greatest
achievement?

326
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,082
His boys.
- Way to go.

327
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,042
- Lex, it seems every
time I turn around,

328
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,210
I'm handing you something.

329
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,548
Now I'm handing you
my Visa card.

330
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,300
Go easy on it, please.
- I'll try to be kind.

331
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,094
No way.
- I can't let you go alone.

332
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:52,016
You got to pick one of the other
five to take with you.

333
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,475
- I'm going to take Big Tom.

334
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,477
- All right, you guys are going
to the Masai Mara.

335
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,730
- I'll be the best date
you ever had.

336
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,731
- (laughing)

337
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,535
- Let's go, Lex,
let's get 'em.

338
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,995
- Woo!

339
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,623
(cheering)

340
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,876
- Oh, yeah.

341
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,510
- We are in an airplane on our
way to Masai Mara.

342
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,014
I mean,
it just blows my mind.

343
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,683
- Just another hour,
everything changed.

344
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,851
- It's great.

345
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,645
- I knew when I picked Tom

346
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,063
that it was going to be
a roller coaster ride.

347
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:44,068
If anyone should see something
completely different

348
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,486
and really
experience Africa,

349
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,905
I thought Tom
was really kind of deserving.

350
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,162
The plane landed and we were
whisked away

351
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,164
to a place called
Governor's Camp.

352
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:02,378
If you can imagine the ultimate
five-star luxury hotel

353
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:07,216
just literally dropped in the
middle of a lush African jungle.

354
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,509
That is what it was.

355
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,053
It was just, it was like the
Garden of Eden.

356
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,347
- Can you believe this?
- Oh!

357
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,060
Cool!

358
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:23,899
Oh, our own pooper.

359
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:30,030
Oh!
Hey-- hey, tattoo.

360
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,240
Oh.

361
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,452
- That is the Mara River.
- Holy moley.

362
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,539
- The hippos are right there.
- Wow.

363
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,289
- Could you just give me your
Visa card please.

364
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,877
- Oh, absolutely.
My pleasure.

365
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,379
There it is.
- Thank you.

366
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,216
- Be sure to get your tip
out of it, yeah.

367
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,053
- No problem.
Sky is the limit.

368
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,597
- Beautiful.
Paradise.

369
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,183
- Jiminy
Cheers, my friend.

370
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,810
- Cheers to you.

371
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,022
Mmm.

372
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:11,321
- We've eaten more right now
than we have in 30 days.

373
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,615
- I don't think we would be
well advised

374
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,953
to describe this place in
all its detail and glory

375
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,079
to everyone else in the
tribe,

376
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,124
because I think they
might just kill us and bury us.

377
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,126
This is a crime considering
they're back there right now.

378
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,252
- We can't tell them
everything.

379
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,798
- Cooking mush
in boiling water.

380
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,633
- We are having
so much more fun

381
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,635
than the guys are on their
trip, don't you think?

382
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,137
- No.

383
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,264
- You don't even care to joke
about it?

384
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,349
- No.
- No.

385
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,979
I think the guys are probably
on the trip of a lifetime.

386
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,647
And we're not.
We are making cards.

387
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,816
- We are making
a deck of cards.

388
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,818
I love cards and I know
lots of games,

389
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,029
so I told them I would teach
them some games.

390
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,363
- We're making the best of it.
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,783
- We're very jealous,
not even of just the trip,

392
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,201
but we're jealous
of the food

393
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,620
that they're going
to get.

394
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,915
- I'm jealous mostly of the
food that they're going to get.

395
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,296
- Look at the tusk
on that hog.

396
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:14,885
Oink! Goodness,
I feel like Marlin Perkins.

397
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,803
- (laughing)

398
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,514
- We just went on
basically a safari.

399
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,517
We got in a vehicle
and got right up

400
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,728
in amongst thousands of
wildebeests.

401
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,188
We got right
in the middle of them.

402
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,981
They didn't know what to do.
We didn't either.

403
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,540
They are crazier than hell.
They are ugly.

404
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,250
They're ugly as a girl
I used to date back home.

405
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:52,172
(grumbling moans and calls)

406
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,715
They are
calling each other.

407
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,716
They're mating.

408
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,759
Hell,
they're butting heads

409
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,177
and knocking each other
to the ground.

410
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,428
It's a cluster.

411
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,222
It is the damnedest thing
you've ever seen.

412
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,517
(grumbling moans and calls)

413
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,018
(imitating calls)

414
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,563
They sound like me on a good
Saturday night when I get home.

415
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:13,569
- Two million head of animal
moving at the same time.

416
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,405
Two million head
of wild animal.

417
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,282
The safari was amazing.

418
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,244
I'm seeing just about
every type of wildlife

419
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,079
that I've wanted to see,

420
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,790
and I'm seeing it all in
the space of an hour.

421
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,417
- We are amongst them,
ain't we?

422
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,043
Look at him, look at him.
There, mate.

423
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,253
- Ah.
- Oh!

424
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,423
That's the way-- Oh!

425
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,051
- See, even with big cats,
yawns are contagious.

426
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,096
The babies, so cute.

427
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:41,430
(elephant trumpeting)

428
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,432
(laughter)

429
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,102
- He thought he was doing
something for us.

430
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,396
He really thinks he is
doing something.

431
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,494
- When we came back from the
safari, we were just bubbling.

432
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,830
- What is this right here,
Tommy?

433
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,417
- All of a sudden, I looked up
there on the side of the river

434
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,629
and I seen two chairs and a
table and on that table,

435
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,006
it had
a few spirits on there.

436
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,258
So I told Lex, I said,

437
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,427
looks like we might ought to
have a toast.

438
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,348
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you for coming.

439
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,440
- (gibberish)
God-- holy.

440
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,027
- Both Tom and I like to
tip a cocktail back

441
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,654
now and again at home.

442
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,614
So our first thought coming
back was I would kill somebody

443
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,157
to get
a nice cold beer in me.

444
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,703
This place is wonderful because
if you want something,

445
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,704
there is
somebody right there.

446
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,831
They can almost
read your mind.

447
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,875
To the game.

448
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,255
I've never drank beer
with a mustache before.

449
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,175
- I never drunk beer with a
hippo before.

450
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,970
(laughing)

451
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,012
- When the dinner bell rang,

452
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,640
Tom wasn't quite done with
his bottle of bourbon.

453
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,142
Tom is definitely not one to
waste anything,

454
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,144
so he took his
bottle with.

455
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,355
In fact,
it was in his pocket.

456
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,734
- You had a good safari?
- Oh, beautiful, thank you.

457
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:22,364
- Thank you.

458
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,367
- Oh, this is nice.
- (laughing)

459
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,869
- We're grilling down
there.

460
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,415
We have some chicken,
we have some lamb.

461
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,835
- Oh, sheep.
- Perfect.

462
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,379
- They brought me a piece
of lamb this big around,

463
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,756
and I'm a meat eater.

464
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,383
I mean, that salad stuff,

465
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,719
it's not for women or
something, but I like meat.

466
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,722
It was absolutely
melting in my mouth.

467
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,597
- Frances, it's beautiful.
Thank you.

468
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,059
- You the man, Fran!

469
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,645
Fix me another sheep.

470
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,568
- I hope you're hungry.
- I'm hungry.

471
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,238
- Good, because I'm
going to imagine

472
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:08,243
this tastes
like mashed potatoes.

473
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,953
- Maybe not.
- No.

474
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,664
It's not working.
Still tastes like corn mush.

475
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,625
- I don't ever
want to eat corn again.

476
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:23,133
Not a corn tortilla, not corn
flakes, not corn chowder,

477
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,260
not corn in the can,
not cream corn,

478
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:28,555
not corn bread,
no corn muffins,

479
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:33,310
no burritos, no corn tortillas,
no popcorn at the movies.

480
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,772
No more corn, please.

481
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,149
(thunder rumbling)

482
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,402
- Listen to that thunder.
- It's raining, all right.

483
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,113
- There has not been
a drop of rain hit my ass

484
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,449
in 40 days and 40 nights.

485
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,327
I want to get up there and
put myself in it.

486
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,620
- When we got
back from dinner,

487
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,664
Tom decided to promptly help
himself

488
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,707
to as much of the
bourbon as possible.

489
00:22:55,791 --> 00:23:00,128
- You want to see a rabbit
pulled out of a hat?

490
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,588
- (laughing)

491
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,466
I know he was
liquored and loaded,

492
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,804
but it just made the
whole night that much funnier.

493
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,473
- Lex, I'm glad
you picked me.

494
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,808
- I'm glad
I picked you, too.

495
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,018
- You'd probably have been
bored with somebody else.

496
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:15,977
You knew you...

497
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,022
Here, you probably
one of the best ones.

498
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,651
Hey, bartender,
fix me a toddy.

499
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,362
Oh, Big Tom will love
everybody.

500
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,114
(laughing)

501
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,157
Don't worry
about them crocs--

502
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,827
Old big Tom got some
stinky socks.

503
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,912
(laughing)

504
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,956
- Tom was spent.

505
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,958
I kind of--
I took him to bed.

506
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,128
- Here we go.
Follow me.

507
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,463
Here we go.
All right.

508
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,756
Feet in there.
- Hey, bartender.

509
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,511
- All I ask is that if you got
to puke, you go outside.

510
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,848
- Yeah, that's...
That's the American way.

511
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,850
- All right?
- Hey, Lex, thank you.

512
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,685
- Hey, my friend,
you're welcome.

513
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,147
- I'd do it for you.
- I know you would.

514
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,442
I know you would.
- Damn right, I would.

515
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:21,209
- Morning.
- Good morning.

516
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,003
- This morning
when I woke up,

517
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,714
my head, it wouldn't have
fit in a wash tub.

518
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,842
I said, where am I?
I had to look around.

519
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,260
I was in a bed.

520
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,511
- We are just waking up early

521
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,221
because we got an early
morning wake-up call

522
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,724
for balloon ride time.

523
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,686
- I drunk a glass of water and
eat four or five cookies.

524
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,732
Well, it was on again--
I just got tanked back up.

525
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,484
Woo!

526
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,405
- Good morning.

527
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,907
- Good morning.
How you doing, Captain?

528
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,785
- Welcome aboard.
- Little bit more heat.

529
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,623
- My God, he pull that and
squirt that fire up there

530
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,707
and it would shoot a flame like
a dragon up in there.

531
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,043
(whooshing)

532
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,170
And when he did,
here we go.

533
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:12,761
Goodness gracious.
Holy moley.

534
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,138
I was almost
this high last night.

535
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,766
- I think you were higher.

536
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:23,271
- This guy, Rob,
he is from England.

537
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,898
Every time we get
talking to him,

538
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,276
the thing would keep going
down, down.

539
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,111
I could see a tree
in front of us.

540
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,991
Oh, my gosh, I'd kind of shout,
and he'd say, oh, and then...

541
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,954
- That's pretty good.

542
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,914
- Well, crikey,
after 30 years,

543
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,790
if I can't get it right
by now, I never will.

544
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,792
- Yeah.

545
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,640
- 30 years,
you ever had to crash?

546
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,641
- Balloons are
wonderfully safe.

547
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,977
The most dangerous thing
about ballooning

548
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,396
is actually spilling
the champagne when you land.

549
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,696
- Look at the hyena.
- He lives there.

550
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,156
- See him.
Look at him run.

551
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,951
Big Tom, look at that.
This is the way to see it.

552
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,787
Looking straight down
into the jungle

553
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,833
looking straight on
overhead on wildlife.

554
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,710
We are just whisking
through the stuff,

555
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,128
you know, while the sun
is coming up.

556
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,171
It was amazing.

557
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,840
It was--
leaves you breathless.

558
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,845
Look at the little
hippo over there.

559
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,806
- They spend all night
eating grass,

560
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,393
then they spend all day in
the river getting rid of it.

561
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,522
- Considering where we've been,
just to see the green,

562
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,983
it makes you appreciate
it so much more.

563
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,484
I hate to even blink.

564
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,861
I'm afraid
I'll miss something.

565
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,654
- There are
wildebeest below us.

566
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,407
- I see two wildebeests
just bombing along.

567
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,159
I said,
"Lex, ain't that funny?"

568
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,911
I said, "All them wildebeests
we've seen-- these two

569
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,788
are down here next to
the river by themselves."

570
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,542
I said, "If I was a lion, I'd
pick that little one out.

571
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,752
It'd be a good meal."

572
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,712
I had no longer said that

573
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,048
than all of a sudden,
a lion popped up.

574
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,382
- Look, look, look!
A lion!

575
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,009
Look at that.
Look at that.

576
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,094
Oh, my God.

577
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,226
- All of a sudden that lion
kind of gives up and I said,

578
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,062
"Well, the wildebeest
has won."

579
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,357
About that time, here popped
another one up.

580
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,401
That lion had ran the wildebeest
into the other one.

581
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,446
- Wow!
Oh, my God.

582
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:40,617
- Now can you believe that?
- Unbelievable.

583
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,038
Nice. Got it!

584
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:50,460
Just like he said.
Death by asphyxiation.

585
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,962
He's just holding his mouth on
top of that wildebeest there.

586
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,467
Where there were two
wildebeest, now there's one.

587
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,927
That was a treat.
- Fantastic.

588
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,761
That is rare.
That is rare.

589
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,263
- That was cool.

590
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,934
- My mind has been a pretty
little old tight thing.

591
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,894
It has not been
expanded very much.

592
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,940
But this whole thing
just gave me new life.

593
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,942
At 45, I thought I had
done some things

594
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,445
and I found out I ain't
done diddly.

595
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,948
This just shows me
that there is more to life

596
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,660
than just what is
around the corner at the house.

597
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,458
- Going back to camp at this
point is going to be miserable.

598
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,793
I mean, I'm feeling
sick about it.

599
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,711
- The same seats have been
reserved for you.

600
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,130
- Oh, thank you much.

601
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,966
- Going back to camp now means
going back to the game.

602
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,301
I'm going to be
the last person standing,

603
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,761
so, in the next couple
of hours,

604
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,971
I'll have to be on my
game again,

605
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,931
as much as it pains me
to admit it.

606
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,646
- If you don't have any of
those cards,

607
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,565
you can change it
with an eight

608
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,607
to any suit you want.

609
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,360
- And you call it?
- You say clubs or whatever.

610
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,487
- I saw the airplane.
- Oh.

611
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,451
- They're back.
- Hey!

612
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,120
- We waved and, you know,
pretended to be really excited

613
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,371
that they were coming back.

614
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,456
Yet we were just hoping
they wouldn't come back

615
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,209
bundles of energy because
we are on a definitely

616
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,961
different wavelength
than those guys.

617
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,046
We were, like,
struggling, depressed,

618
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,132
you know, hoping we
could go to sleep.

619
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,509
- Hey.
- Hello.

620
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,012
- They came back and very
subtly and slowly

621
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,849
described their adventures,
which sounded wonderful to us.

622
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,017
- I know how rich people
vacation in Africa now.

623
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,895
- The wildebeest was flying,
zigzagging.

624
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,565
I mean, she was
just cat and mouse.

625
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,358
- It was neat hearing about
everything they did,

626
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,860
but my mind is kind of
going in different directions

627
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,862
on what to do,
and now at this point,

628
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:45,033
instead of boggling myself
down mentally with strategy,

629
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,369
I'm really just holding out
to see what happens

630
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,829
with the immunity challenge.

631
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,340
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Jeff.

632
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,008
- Okay, today's immunity
challenge

633
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,551
works a little
differently.

634
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,721
Today, you win by
eliminating the others.

635
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:07,931
There are 18 hanging pots--

636
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,350
you each have your name
on three of those pots.

637
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,852
Those pots represent your
immunity.

638
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,478
As long as you have a pot
hanging,

639
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,979
you are still in the game.

640
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,898
When the pots are gone,
so are you.

641
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,026
These sticks are traditional
African weapons called rungas.

642
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,905
A skilled warrior can crack a
skull with one of these.

643
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,241
All you have to do
is break the pots

644
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,742
and make them fall
to the ground.

645
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,577
You'll throw
one stick per round.

646
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,580
After each round,
you'll switch positions.

647
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,917
Your goal, break your opponents
pots before they break yours.

648
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,419
Last one left standing wins
immunity.

649
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,088
So, let me have it back.

650
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,552
Now here we go.
Immunity at stake once again.

651
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:49,514
Survivors ready?
Go!

652
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,608
First one.
- Tommy, that hurts.

653
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,277
- Tommy, good shot.

654
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,612
- All right, everybody
rotate two steps down.

655
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,408
Teresa still has two pots left.
Everyone else has three.

656
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,993
Survivors ready?
Go!

657
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,460
Tom, with another bust,

658
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,963
taking out one of Teresa's,
one of Kim Powers.

659
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,465
- I'm not talking to you.

660
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,302
- Survivors ready?
Go!

661
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,350
- You hit me, Tom.

662
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,769
- Big Tom so far has
taken out one of Teresa's,

663
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,146
one of Lex's
and one of Kim Powers.

664
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,523
Toss.

665
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,737
- Ah!

666
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,864
- Kim Johnson, you hit
your own pot.

667
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,157
- I don't think it fell.
- That pot is dead.

668
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,330
Teresa, Lex, Kim Powers and Kim
Johnson have each lost one pot.

669
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,790
Survivors ready?
Throw.

670
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,713
Was that you, Ethan,
took out Kim Powers?

671
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,672
- Yeah, sorry, Kimmy.

672
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,007
- Kim Powers, you're
down to one pot left.

673
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,302
He did offer up an apology.
- Yeah, whatever.

674
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,179
- It was sort of a...
quiet one.

675
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,347
- I heard it.
I heard it.

676
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,932
- Survivors ready.
Throw.

677
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,066
Ethan took out Teresa.
Tom took out Teresa.

678
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,234
Have a seat on the bench.
Kim Powers, you are down to one.

679
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,571
Lex, you are down to two.
Everybody else is good.

680
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,949
Survivors ready.
Toss.

681
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,330
Kim Powers.
Out of the game, Kim.

682
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,582
Sorry, but, Tom,
you are going down.

683
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,418
- Watch how you talk.
- Toss.

684
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,590
Ethan takes his first hit.

685
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,009
Survivors ready.
Throw.

686
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,349
Tom takes
a hit from Kim Johnson.

687
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,310
Survivors ready.
Throw.

688
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,439
Ethan takes another hit
from Big Tom.

689
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,025
Ethan down to one left.
Everybody else has two.

690
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,444
Survivors ready?
Throw.

691
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,908
You got one left, Kim.
Ethan, you got one left.

692
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,326
Lex and Tom have two.

693
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,745
Survivors ready.
Throw.

694
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,917
Ethan takes out Lex.

695
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,420
Lex, Kim Johnson,
Ethan, down to one.

696
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,255
Throw.

697
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,261
- Oh, you!
- (imitates donkey braying)

698
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,304
- Ethan out of the game.
We're down to three.

699
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,890
Big Tom,
you have two pots left.

700
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,436
K.J. and Lex, one pot.
Throw.

701
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,777
- Kim Johnson, you are
hanging on by a thread,

702
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,404
but you are still in.

703
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,280
- You rat.

704
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,742
- Survivors ready.
Throw.

705
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:06,627
Lex, you are done.
We're down to two.

706
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,297
Big Tom and K.J.
K.J., you have one pot left.

707
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,758
Big Tom, you have two.

708
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,470
Survivors ready?
Toss.

709
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,184
Whoa! Kim, you took out
one of Tom's.

710
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,270
Tom took out your last one.
- Good work, Tom.

711
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,314
- About time,
Tommy, about time.

712
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,108
- Hey, baby.
- Good job.

713
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,693
- Big Tom,
get over here.

714
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,736
- Every dog has his day.

715
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,488
- Let's see if this will fit
around your neck.

716
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,322
Turn around.

717
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,657
- Hey, watch
Buster the boil there.

718
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,951
- There we go.
Congratulations.

719
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,287
Nice work.
- Yes.

720
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,955
- It was about time for me,
boys.

721
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,582
I was lucky.
- Hey, good shot.

722
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,511
(laughter and chatter)

723
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,179
- Seven days.
Seven days, seven days.

724
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:03,476
- Seven days.
- Day 33.

725
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,186
- Every now and then, I like
giggle to myself.

726
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,064
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
you know, I'm almost there."

727
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,232
You know, I don't
want to, you know,

728
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,192
I don't want to screw
anything up

729
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,404
and it's exciting,
it's really exciting.

730
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,200
- Nobody can vote for me when
we go to Tribal Council,

731
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,578
so I'm guaranteed
to be here tomorrow.

732
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,163
Somebody is going
to leave tonight,

733
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,373
but it ain't going to
be me.

734
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,717
- T-Bird's got-- she's got
a lot of fire in her belly.

735
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,426
I know that there's
nothing more dangerous

736
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,012
than a desperate animal--

737
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,349
an animal or a person that wants
something bad enough

738
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,726
that they're willing
to just try anything.

739
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,567
- I really don't want to see
the guys come down to the end.

740
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,777
- No, I don't either.

741
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,863
- If you go up against any of
the guys in the jury...

742
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,614
- The guys are going to win.
- Probably.

743
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,950
- I talked to Teresa.

744
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,078
Her plan was to, basically try
to get the girls to get together

745
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:07,081
and maybe round up Tommy or
something, and vote against Lex.

746
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,292
- There is three of us
and three of them.

747
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,252
- Yeah, but they want Lex
first.

748
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,461
- Right.

749
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,338
- But I don't know that Tom is
going to vote for Lex.

750
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,257
- Tom-- I say Tom
will vote for Lex.

751
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,550
- You do?

752
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,594
- If we could get one
more to side with us,

753
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,137
we could get Lex off.

754
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,097
This is the time you got to
start thinking who do you want

755
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,891
to go to the end with
and who do you want off?

756
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,518
I think
I'll vote for Lex next.

757
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,729
- Listen, I'm not stupid.

758
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:35,526
Anything that includes me
sounds good, you know?

759
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,908
- If I live to be 100, I still
can't thank Lex enough

760
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,326
for him giving me
the opportunity

761
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,953
to go on our safari,

762
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,665
but even after going,
I'm still irritated with Lex.

763
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,499
I don't think
he did me right.

764
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,420
Lex recruited Brandon
to save him.

765
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,466
I felt like Lex betrayed me.

766
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,384
He knows
my feelings on that.

767
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,779
- Now bring in the jury.
Kelly, Frank, Brandon.

768
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:29,330
33 days.
Big week for you, Big Tom.

769
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,999
Win immunity,
go to the Mara.

770
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,377
- It's...
we haven't got time

771
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,964
to tell you how big
a trip it was.

772
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,298
Unbelievable.

773
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,634
Probably the best
two days of my life.

774
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:45,972
There is no way I can repay Lex
for the taking me along.

775
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,473
I mean,
if I live to be 100,

776
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,516
thank you
don't go far enough.

777
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,685
- Lex, from your point
of view,

778
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,561
how was Tom as
a traveling partner?

779
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,398
- Never a dull moment,
had a great time.

780
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,067
It was a blast.

781
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,194
- Without thinking,
going to ask you a question,

782
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,154
give me the first thing that
comes to your mind.

783
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,699
Ethan, when you think about
home what do you miss most?

784
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,741
- Couch.
- Teresa?

785
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,867
- Children.
Children.

786
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,536
- The ability to be
totally relaxed.

787
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,915
- Wife and kids, no doubt.
- My mom.

788
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,709
- Cheeseburger.

789
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,919
(laughter)

790
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,713
- So with the exception
of Big Tom,

791
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,381
a lot of it is family,
loved ones.

792
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,719
Are they going to be proud of
how you played the game so far?

793
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,928
How about
for you, Kim Powers?

794
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:26,762
- I've never even camped
before,

795
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,056
so I think they'll be
pretty proud

796
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,392
that I actually made it
33 days sleeping outside.

797
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,394
- Big Tom, are you proud with
how you played the game?

798
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:37,940
- Maybe.

799
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,568
Maybe me and Lex
had a moment or two.

800
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,527
I might cringe a little,

801
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,363
but I don't remember
that much about it.

802
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,451
Other than that, I have--
I hold my head up.

803
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,578
I have no regrets.

804
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,579
- How about you,
Teresa?

805
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,914
- Probably wouldn't have
started out

806
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,583
building such an
alliance when I started.

807
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,544
I think that caused a lot of
friction with our tribe,

808
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,588
so I wouldn't have
started out that way.

809
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,049
- Kim, how about for you?

810
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,718
- I feel that I've played the
game the way I run my life.

811
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,722
I'm very proud
to have been here.

812
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,140
- How about you, Ethan?

813
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:11,724
- I like the way I've been
playing the game.

814
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,642
I'm having a lot of fun.

815
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,270
So far
it has gone pretty well,

816
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,481
but, I don't know-- it could
change tomorrow.

817
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:22,568
- Lex, three out of the
last four challenges you've won.

818
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,321
Been a while since you've been
to Tribal Council

819
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,490
without that
necklace around your neck.

820
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,283
How different is it tonight?

821
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,743
- Well, I mean,
it feels a lot different

822
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,286
not having the protection

823
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,246
and the defense of
that immunity necklace.

824
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,956
I might be a target.

825
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,250
I mean, sure--
and I've seen my name

826
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,753
on more than one or two cards
at previous Tribal Councils.

827
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:41,670
So I know what it's like

828
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,632
to almost be taking
that walk of shame.

829
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,926
But that's the reality
of Tribal Council.

830
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:51,430
And, you know, I'm here
to try to make it through.

831
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,515
- It's time to vote.
Big Tom you're first.

832
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,996
- This is the part
of the game I hate.

833
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,540
Having to vote
someone out of the tribe

834
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,833
that you really care about.

835
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,167
I'm stoked you made it
this far, though.

836
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,002
I'm really stoked.

837
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,770
- You're
a strong competitor.

838
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,523
That's why
I'm giving you my vote.

839
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,567
I'm still crazy about you,
though.

840
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,613
- I'll go tally the votes.

841
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,002
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

842
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,044
Person will
be asked to leave

843
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,588
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

844
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,590
I'll read the votes.

845
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,014
First vote, Lex.

846
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,810
Lex.
Two votes, Lex.

847
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,440
Kim Powers.

848
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,945
Kim Powers.

849
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,324
Two votes Kim.
Two votes Lex.

850
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,830
Kim, that's three votes Kim,
two votes, Lex.

851
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,585
Last vote...

852
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,754
Kim Powers.

853
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,714
You need to
bring me your torch.

854
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,353
Kim, the tribe has spoken.

855
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,024
It's time for you to go.

856
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,740
You can head back to camp.
Good night.

857
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,637
- Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

858
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,640
- Next time
on<i> Survivor...</i>

859
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,017
Moto Maji
endures new hardships.

860
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,644
- We got an elephant
disrespecting our spring.

861
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,646
- One Survivor
becomes the ambassador

862
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,691
of a momentous delivery

863
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,819
and a long-standing alliance
is thrown into question.

864
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,695
- If I think that
he's in a situation

865
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,862
where he's about to
screw me over

866
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,658
and stab me in the back,
I'll cut his throat.

867
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,831
- It was a heck of a game.

868
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,499
It was something
that I will never,

869
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:07,668
ever be able to describe
in enough detail

870
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,045
to give anybody
who wasn't here

871
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,214
any idea what it was
actually like to be out here.

872
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,675
I've gained some courage and
gained some inner strength

873
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,677
and I'm very,
very thankful for that.

874
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,679
It's been something

875
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,807
that will probably have
changed me for the good, I hope.
