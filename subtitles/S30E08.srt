translated to english from Addic7ed french: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,260
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,620
- After 17 days... 
- Where's Jeff?

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,600
Nagarote and Escameca

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,870
eventually merged.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,850
You merged!

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,550
One tribe, competing 
for a million dollars.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,170
And at the first 
individual immunity test,

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,340
Joe held out longer 
than all the others.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,020
Joe wins individual immunity!

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,850
- Close to the council... 
- We can't have Joe.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,990
- So let's eliminate his right arm, Hali. 
- Yes, very well.

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,640
...Mike wanted to test 
Will's loyalty.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,970
If I see Hali's name tonight, 
I can trust Will.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,960
But the real power struggle 
was between the Blues, targeting Jenn,

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,930
and the Colorless, 
which targeted Kelly,

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,800
with the White Collars in the middle...

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,870
They need our votes.

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,680
deciding 
who would take control.

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,610
Wherever we go, it will change 
this game decisively.

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,910
At the council, Shirin remained 
with the Colorless,

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,780
while Carolyn, Tyler and Will

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,260
sided with the majority.

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,230
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it...

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,450
But a majority doesn't matter 
if an idol is played at the perfect time.

26
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,040
Yeah, I 
really don't want to leave tonight.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,550
Seventh person eliminated: Kelly.

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,610
And in the end, Kelly was eliminated.

29
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,120
Kelly, the tribe has spoken.

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,450
There are 11 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,040
Welcome to Survivor, 
ladies and gentlemen!

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,440
We got down to business.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,620
Well done, ladies!

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,080
- Good game ! 
- Well done, Jenn!

35
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,550
Seeing Kelly leave 
broke my heart.

36
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,170
It shouldn't have happened. 
I'm very sorry,

37
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,710
and I blame Mike for that.

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,080
Mike is the leader, 
he changed the vote.

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,810
It must have been Hali, 
he changed it at the last moment

40
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,660
to test Will's loyalty.

41
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,080
Mike is 
a stupid slob, that's all.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,310
Mike is at the controls 
and looks at the result!

43
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,260
Seven against four now.

44
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,570
- I say. 
- Then hang on to me.

45
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,540
Listen... 
Give me your love.

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,760
- I gave it to you! 
- I...

47
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,690
- I'm the only one to have voted Hali! 
- That was Mike!

48
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,850
- It was Mike! 
- I know, he wanted me to vote Hali!

49
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,870
Look, whatever.

50
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,160
We got you, me, Tyler...

51
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,920
Mama C ...

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,530
There's Mama C Carol,

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,070
we're all in on it.

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,250
I love my Blues

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,830
but it will become very interesting 
when we are only seven.

56
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,210
- Yeah, okay. 
- But Mike is in charge.

57
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,160
We'll leave the controls to him.

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,150
But once Joe, Hali, 
Jenn and Shirin are gone,

59
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,080
We will take control.

60
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,040
- Good job. 
- Thanks.

61
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,370
It clearly didn't 
go the way I wanted tonight.

62
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,190
Sorry to disappoint you 
by still being here, Mike, but...

63
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,000
I knew I was targeted, 
so I played my idol.

64
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,910
And Kelly left.

65
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,610
But I respect

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,730
this shot was...

67
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,280
- It was pretty. 
- [???]

68
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,550
Joe, Hali, Shirin and I 
were thrilled.

69
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,630
To the angels.

70
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,420
The others were 
speechless, shocked,

71
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,350
and sad, "poor Kelly"!

72
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,340
We do not care ! It was great !

73
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,450
- Well... 
- But I appreciate it.

74
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,870
The Colorless are back

75
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,720
we are ready to win.

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,230
I love putting the bronx 
in the other alliances.

77
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,980
I think we can 
still have fun,

78
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,960
find stuff 
to screw up for others.

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,610
I want to put the bronx on 
while I can,

80
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,530
because it cracks me up.

81
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,970
How many doses did you take?

82
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,450
Three. I believe that 
was the general consensus.

83
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,360
uh well...

84
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,790
Add a little more.

85
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,750
Just a little more.

86
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,740
I was told it was three.

87
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,020
I tell you something else.

88
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,250
So...

89
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,310
Since the arrival of Joe 
and his charlots,

90
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,520
they run the kitchen, 
decide the portions...

91
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,390
But hey, when I get angry, 
I walk away,

92
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,870
I'm going to kick 
a tree or something,

93
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,500
and I come back cool, calm and serene.

94
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,200
But why...

95
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,830
I'd rather 
peel the skin myself.

96
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,120
- As you wish. 
- I like to eat next to my skin

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,010
and chew it.

98
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,370
For me, respect is earned.

99
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,710
Here, for me, 
there is something to trip up.

100
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,390
I'm not being a hypocrite.

101
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,150
I have to respect 
you to show you respect.

102
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,980
If I don't respect you, 
you will know it.

103
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,200
It's not much, 
just to leave the skin.

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,100
In that case, I'll do what 
I want. How are you?

105
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,120
- It's just salami. 
- Just salami.

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,070
I know, so...

107
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,220
Why are you interfering 
in what I do?

108
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,690
Nope ? If it's just salami,

109
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,890
Does it matter if I take 
the skin off for Tyler or me?

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,860
- I was just saying. 
- So say it.

111
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,430
- I said it. 
- [???]

112
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,320
- [???] 
- Yeah.

113
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,970
Shiri, Sherry, 
whatever her name is,

114
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,270
she is out of place, 
she has nothing to do here.

115
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,170
Nobody supports it. 
But hey, it's a game.

116
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,770
We are seven, the four of them.

117
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,330
Basically, it's over for them.

118
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,160
We have to eliminate the waste.

119
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,970
Over here everyone!

120
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,770
Ready for 
today's reward event?

121
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,080
- Absolutely. 
- Yes.

122
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,860
Today you will cross 
a series of beams,

123
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,540
collecting bags of puzzle pieces along the way .

124
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,560
With each bag collected, 
you will drop it off and leave.

125
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,060
The first three to bring 
their three bags to the end

126
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,790
will advance to the final round,

127
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,770
where to use these parts

128
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,900
to solve 
a puzzle in the shape of an anchor.

129
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,410
The first to complete his puzzle

130
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,500
win the reward. 
Want to know what's at stake?

131
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,150
The winner of the race

132
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,870
will be taken into the 
rainforest canopy.

133
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,890
You will descend 
using a zip line.

134
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,860
Downstairs, a picnic will be waiting for you.

135
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,590
A pizza picnic.

136
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,410
Nice afternoon in perspective.

137
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,310
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

138
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,840
Let's go. For the reward. 
Survivors, ready?

139
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,790
Dan falls heavily, straight away. 
He has to start over.

140
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,280
Shirin falls, she starts again.

141
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,460
These beams are not easy.

142
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,080
And you have to keep your balance 
while untying the bags.

143
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,760
Here is Joe with his first bag.

144
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,390
And this is Mike.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,340
Joe passed.

146
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,110
Jenn passed. Mike passed.

147
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,400
Hali passed.

148
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,240
And this is Sierra and Tyler.

149
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,450
Tyler takes a big leap, 
and he's past.

150
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,000
We need three people 
with the three bags.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
Dan passed.

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,250
And this is Rodney, 
and Will, he made it.

153
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,340
Everyone is on the 2nd bag,

154
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,660
except Shirin, still on her 1st.

155
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,780
I can't!

156
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,150
Carolyn falls, 
she has to start over.

157
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,090
Here is Joe, with his 2nd bag.

158
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,260
Joe flies over the ordeal.

159
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,870
On his heels: Mike.

160
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,930
Joe and Mike lead.

161
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,110
We need the first three, 
along with the three bags.

162
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,270
Here is Hali, with her 2nd bag.

163
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,570
This is Sierra, with her 2nd bag.

164
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,430
Carolyn fails again.

165
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,700
2nd bag for Jenn.

166
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,840
And this is Tyler. A lot of people 
are in on it.

167
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,270
Here is Joe, with his last bag.

168
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,590
Joe qualifies.

169
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,130
Rodney to ... 
Not Rodney Graves!

170
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,470
Mike qualifies.

171
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,170
There is one place left.

172
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,670
We have Joe, we have Mike...

173
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,620
...And Hali qualifies!

174
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,220
Good. It's Hali

175
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,280
Joe and Mike.

176
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,850
The first to finish 
wins a nice reward.

177
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,320
Survivors, ready? 
Go!

178
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,130
- Go on ! 
- First step: empty the bags.

179
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,880
Go Mike!

180
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,060
You go-y Joe !

181
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,080
You assemble an anchor.

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,070
A rusty anchor.

183
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,060
One Overall, two Colorless,

184
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,830
who clash.

185
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,050
- Mike is off to a good start. 
- That's good, Mike!

186
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,790
Joe tries to move on.

187
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,840
Hali begins to progress.

188
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,700
Some parts 
may fit in more than one place,

189
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,330
but there is only one way 
to complete it.

190
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,210
Another piece for Hali.

191
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,680
Hali seems well launched now.

192
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,770
Joe moves a few coins. 
He acts quickly.

193
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,210
Mike hasn't made much progress.

194
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,180
Thanks, Jeff.

195
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,170
- Another room for Hali. 
- Yeah, Hali!

196
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,730
Another room for Joe.

197
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,820
- Mike gets left behind. 
- Calm down. Calm.

198
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,890
Five pieces left for Hali, 
four left for Joe.

199
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,470
If they are not mistaken, 
they are both very close.

200
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,990
It's on the last pieces 
that it gets complicated.

201
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,440
Hali moves a few pieces, 
she is at five again.

202
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,460
It's inevitable. Close to the goal, 
you'll realize it's wrong,

203
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,060
and you will have to move a piece.

204
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,970
Joe moves a whole portion,

205
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,450
giving 
Mike a chance to come back.

206
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,610
Mike does not give up, 
he continues to fight.

207
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,650
Go Mike!

208
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,590
Another room for Mike.

209
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,360
Mike is in on it again.

210
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,740
Joe is trying to figure 
something out.

211
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,930
Hali tries out a new combination.

212
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,450
Something is wrong.

213
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,940
Only four pieces left for Mike.

214
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,180
Four pieces left for Joe.

215
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,080
Or even three. 
Mike begins to panic.

216
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,770
Two more for Joe. 
Joe is launched.

217
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,940
More than one piece, it's the last!

218
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,280
Joe made it! 
Joe wins the award!

219
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,390
Joe, come closer!

220
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,110
Well done, Joe!

221
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,990
Thank you my friend.

222
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,420
Undefeated so far 
in the individual part of the game.

223
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,320
Beautiful afternoon. Zip line, pizza...

224
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,820
Joe, choose three people 
to accompany you.

225
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,760
I choose Tyler.

226
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,900
Tyler, come closer.

227
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,060
Will, come join Tyler.

228
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,660
In the last event, 
Mama C ensured,

229
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,060
she deserves the reward 
today.

230
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,760
- So, Mama C. 
- Carolyn, come closer!

231
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,210
Good. You are four, but a good 
round number would be five.

232
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,310
- Serious ?! 
- Choose one last person...

233
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,190
- Damn it ! 
- ...to accompany you.

234
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,930
Damn it ! I'm 
the most hungry, so...

235
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,510
You eat the most, too.

236
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,300
No. [???], then...

237
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,930
If you don't take me, 
it doesn't matter, we are seven welded,

238
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,660
and that's fine with me. 
It will be as it will be.

239
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,760
Rodney therefore withdraws from the choice.

240
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,350
No. But I don't care. 
I am lucid.

241
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,750
And I'll stay clear, Jeff.

242
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,790
Who will it be, Joe?

243
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,360
You have one spot left.

244
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,130
Super-fan!

245
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,890
Super-fan!

246
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,090
Super-fan.

247
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,220
Serious ? Serious ?

248
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,540
- Oh my God ! 
- And that's why. That.

249
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,980
Oh my God !

250
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,370
It is a unique experience.

251
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,840
We have the five leaving 
for a beautiful afternoon.

252
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,700
Take your things, on the way, 
enjoy!

253
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,710
- Thanks Jeff. 
- Cheer.

254
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,030
Have fun !

255
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,530
Really good !

256
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,920
I stay cool. 
I am here to play.

257
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,180
Damn, I hate you.

258
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,390
I have nothing for you. Take 
your things, return to camp.

259
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,850
Joe's victory 
was a disaster,

260
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,120
because he will probably have a clue

261
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
on the immunity idol 
during the reward.

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,350
This kid is amazing.

263
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,650
How am I going to beat him?

264
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,400
This is the moment of truth.

265
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,790
I won the reward,

266
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,470
and it was fantastic to float 
above the jungle.

267
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,270
I had never 
used a zip line,

268
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,130
and Lord, 
it was super cool!

269
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,880
There was me

270
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,740
There you are, Carolyn!

271
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,680
Yeah !

272
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,160
It's crazy!

273
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,130
... et Shirin.

274
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,610
Who's next ?

275
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
To me !

276
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,420
Oh my God !

277
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,500
Start braking!

278
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,100
- Brake! 
- I braked!

279
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,780
You came way too soon.

280
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,550
You have come to the bottom.

281
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,290
That's a tree. Better to avoid it.

282
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,160
I couldn't believe my luck.

283
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,230
I got to zipline 
with Carolyn, and...

284
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,130
Shit !

285
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,340
I don't like her, I don't want 
her to eat pizza

286
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,480
and may she have a cool adventure!

287
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,320
- Cinnamon rolls! 
- Cinnamon rolls.

288
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,150
- Come sit down, buddy. 
- Yeah.

289
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,880
Lord, 
I was so excited.

290
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,080
There's watermelon 
and pizza and soda...

291
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,180
I take an orange.

292
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,070
- Who wants a red one? 
- I do not care.

293
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,950
Looking at it, Joe made 
an interesting choice,

294
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,460
because he took no Blue,

295
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,970
because obviously, 
the Blues want his skin.

296
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,020
- Cheers, everyone! 
- Health !

297
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,300
I was happy with it. It was well seen.

298
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,950
I thought I noticed something 
in Carolyn's bottle.

299
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,270
Rodney was pissed 
we didn't put rice in it.

300
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,880
- I would like more soda. 
- Here !

301
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,870
I do not want it anymore.

302
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,360
And so, Jen...

303
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,170
I took it, and immediately,

304
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,550
I saw that there was 
a message at the bottom.

305
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,100
And so he started to...

306
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,650
I tried to swallow it, 
put it in my mouth.

307
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,020
But I saw Tyler 
looking at me.

308
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,510
What's that one?

309
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,180
This is delicious.

310
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,860
Tyler saw me, 
so I'm thinking of a plan

311
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,840
for us to read it together, 
and what we are going to do.

312
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,060
I take a little.

313
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,480
- Yeah, he finished the previous one. 
- Sorry.

314
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,310
No problem.

315
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,280
We will have to question it.

316
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,020
- He was... 
- You're going to get scolded.

317
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,760
It was hot, you wouldn't have liked it.

318
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,140
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Joe 
almost choking on a clue.

319
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,530
I could have denounced him 
at the time.

320
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,870
But I kept silent.

321
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,180
This index opened up 
new options.

322
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,500
If Joe finds the immunity idol,

323
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,590
it also opens up 
new options.

324
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,860
Dawn was barely breaking,

325
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,890
and Tyler was wide awake, presumably 
waiting for me to get up.

326
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,760
I'll share the clue 
with Tyler,

327
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,900
which will bring us closer.

328
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,930
I sit with my eyes 
wide open, watching,

329
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,610
as if I was sleeping.

330
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,930
Joe and Tyler get up,

331
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,330
bring dishes, 
as if they were going to the river.

332
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,970
I knew that today 
would be the mad dash,

333
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,680
for I assumed there had been 
a clue to the hidden idol.

334
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,650
All along, I track them, 
from tree to tree,

335
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,730
a la James Bond.

336
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,700
I jump in these bushes, 
I climb this tree,

337
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,350
I watch through the leaves,

338
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,230
I try to stay camouflaged, 
out of their sight.

339
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,870
"Explore near a tributary.

340
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,860
The power sought is 
near a sea of ​​green,

341
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,000
defying gravity 
in its concealed hollow."

342
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,280
So it's...

343
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,090
Why would Joe show 
Tyler a clue about the idol?

344
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,120
Unless you want to curry 
favor with him.

345
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,780
Hey, guys!

346
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,340
How are you this morning ?

347
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,940
I slept very badly.

348
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,760
Yeah, I stink 
of campfire and ashes.

349
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,560
Joe reads the clue, and 
in an instant Mike is upon us.

350
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,100
I didn't know what he had seen,

351
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,270
he could have seen me 
reading the clue with Joe.

352
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,430
I have to be very careful 
not to alienate my allies.

353
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,790
And so, what to say to Mike?

354
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,310
So...

355
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,680
The to the index.

356
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,230
But he didn't tell anyone.

357
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,970
So he's near the river,

358
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,370
near a sea of ​​green,

359
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,600
defying gravity in a hollow.

360
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,770
I told him 
what the clue said.

361
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,600
Then began a mad dash 
to find Joe,

362
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,880
and Mike led 
the pack of insanity.

363
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,380
Joe's on camp?

364
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,810
I believed it with you.

365
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,410
Not. On the index,

366
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,430
and Joe is nowhere to be found.

367
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,350
Wherever it is, 
that's where the clue leads.

368
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,840
All right, we need to find Joe.

369
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,460
Joe left alone.

370
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,470
He's looking for the idol 
right now.

371
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,800
And nobody...

372
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,710
...don't watch Joe.

373
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,960
I was changing.

374
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,040
He was following the path, this way, 
I don't know where he went.

375
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,740
We have to find Joe before 
he finds the idol, so that...

376
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,610
So we can eliminate him, 
and it won't be me.

377
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,630
'Cause I honestly feel

378
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,720
that when Joe is gone,

379
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,980
if I have nothing in my pocket, 
I'll be next.

380
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,260
So I'm going to get Joe.

381
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,330
Sure enough, I walk over 
and find Joe.

382
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,700
I realize I want to enlarge 
the target behind his back.

383
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,430
I haven't seen him find an idol 
or put it in his pocket.

384
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,820
So I went to the river.

385
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,460
Well done, little brother!

386
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,240
- Good game ! 
- I do not know what you're talking about.

387
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,810
- You have it. 
- He found her?

388
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah, he has.

389
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,330
I do not know what you're talking about.

390
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,940
Basically, I yelled: 
“Bravo, you found the idol!”.

391
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,230
He tried to deviate,

392
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,360
but I won't let him.

393
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,530
I'll say I believe he has it,

394
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,300
that I saw him put 
it in his pocket... Or not.

395
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,740
You know I have 
to break your neck, huh?

396
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,900
- I do not have a choice. 
- No, of course.

397
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,280
I do not have a choice.

398
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,060
It's a game. 
That's the best part.

399
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,980
Mike shows up... 
"You, then!

400
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,630
I can't believe you got it!" 
And blah blah blah.

401
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,530
Well done, bro.

402
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,620
Yeah, Mike messed up my plan.

403
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,680
Mike said I had it, 
he's convinced of it.

404
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,500
- And you don't have it? 
- Nope.

405
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,690
But they all think I have it.

406
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,140
The good thing is. So...

407
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,950
- If I remain cushy, they will believe it. 
- Yeah.

408
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,870
In a hollow...

409
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,620
Are you worried 
about that damn idol?

410
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,850
In.

411
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,420
It's you who amaze me, 
to be honest.

412
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,630
But really.

413
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,130
- You're like me, a fan. 
- Yeah.

414
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,020
How come fans 
can't count?

415
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,160
Why join a minority?

416
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,220
I have plans, you see.

417
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,520
You're Joe's underling. 
This is how you are perceived.

418
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,700
Seriously.

419
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,120
The game is over for you.

420
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,090
- Your game is over. 
- You don't understand my game.

421
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,930
Yes that's it !

422
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,510
Once again, another fan 
who can't count.

423
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,220
Shinini, 
or whatever his name is,

424
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,220
I can't remember 
her name, she annoys me so much!

425
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,980
Someone slap this woman!

426
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,770
For the love of God, 
slap her, shut her up!

427
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,120
Good Lord ! 
Do us this favour!

428
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,830
Hope 
his torch is extinguished!

429
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,450
You are an easy target.

430
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,630
If Joe wins immunity tomorrow,

431
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,140
and if he has the immunity idol,

432
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,770
do you think he will give it to you?

433
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,490
Exact. So that makes you 
a very easy target.

434
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,190
Dan is trying to tear me down.

435
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,120
He hurls insult after insult at me.

436
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,010
I really felt sorry for him.

437
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,280
I let it go, saying to myself:

438
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,220
"And after ?".

439
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,050
There are only two kinds 
of people in this game.

440
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,670
Those who do nothing 
and get eliminated for that,

441
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,640
and those who overdo 
it annoy everyone and get fired.

442
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,580
You are the example.

443
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,560
You are solely responsible.

444
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,780
And that's just the truth.

445
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,480
In fact, I try to be nice.

446
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,880
Really.

447
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,940
I spent the day 
chasing after the idol.

448
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,240
I'm at a termite nest 
and I'm trying

449
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,770
to sustain me a little.

450
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,550
It gives me strength 
to keep looking.

451
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,670
Still no luck in 
the idol quest for Mike.

452
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,910
It's such an exhausting game, 
physically and mentally.

453
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,400
It's rough.

454
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,520
That's the rough part of the game. 
But...

455
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,450
I have to find her.

456
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,550
It must.

457
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,210
So...

458
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,790
Work awaits me.

459
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,170
It is not an easy task.

460
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,630
Don't think you'll find 
an idol by snapping your fingers.

461
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,610
It's impossible.

462
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,860
We have to keep looking.

463
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,200
Look in every corner, 
every crack.

464
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,610
Those who find 
idols in this game,

465
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,750
are 
the hardest working ones in this game.

466
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,050
God's goodness !

467
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,000
This is what we do!

468
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,550
Dance of Happiness!

469
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,470
Dance of Happiness! 
Is this for real?!

470
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,550
You think 
nothing is right.

471
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,440
Keep digging deep inside of you, 
when that's all you have left.

472
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,030
And this,

473
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,260
this is what you find.

474
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,620
And you know what ? 
I will not share.

475
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,620
Because this protection, 
I need it for myself.

476
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,380
Now I have a chance 
to get rid of Joe.

477
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,790
So if Joe doesn't win 
individual immunity,

478
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,470
Joe has to go.

479
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,710
It's that simple.

480
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,270
Oh my God !

481
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,310
Over here everyone!

482
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,670
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

483
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,370
Yes sir !

484
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,410
- First of all, Joe, I get it back. 
- Yeah.

485
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,130
They don't help me!

486
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,830
It's a trick.

487
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,650
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

488
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,030
Today you will move 
a puzzle piece

489
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,690
through 
three sliding mazes.

490
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,810
When you have taken him through 
the three labyrinths,

491
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,980
you will use this piece 
to complete

492
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,200
a sliding puzzle.

493
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,230
The first to finish 
wins immunity,

494
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,470
make sure to continue the game.

495
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,780
The losers will go to the council, 
where after 22 days,

496
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,280
someone's quest for the million 
and the title of Ultimate Survivor

497
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,200
will experience failure.

498
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,940
Shirin, how 
are you feeling? A puzzle !

499
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,760
No beams, no obstacles...

500
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,880
A puzzle.

501
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,320
That's what I expected.

502
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,080
I'm a computer scientist, 
that should be my department.

503
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,030
It comes back to the fact 
that I am a super fan.

504
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,270
I'm always 
so excited to be here.

505
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,780
And I want 
to be here so much that...

506
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,270
- I'm freaking out. 
- So you have...

507
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,600
I have so much energy, Jeff!

508
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,630
- I have to contain her. 
- Summon her!

509
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,430
It's the opposite of a bomb, I...

510
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,850
- Yes this. 
- You get the idea?

511
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Well, we draw the places 
and we start.

512
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,320
Let's go. For immunity. 
Survivors, ready?

513
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,400
You have a puzzle piece,

514
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,700
she has to go through 
three sliding mazes,

515
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,240
then comes the sliding puzzle.

516
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,060
Joe starts fast. 
Sierra falls, but she passes.

517
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,510
There are Hali, Tyler, 
Dan, Carolyn, Shirin.

518
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,110
And this is Jenn.

519
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,420
And this is Will.

520
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,410
Good last: Rodney.

521
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,320
Shit !

522
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,470
Joe proceeds to the 3rd maze.

523
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,360
Shirin is on the 3rd. 
This is Tyler and Mike.

524
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,290
Shirin, Joe, Tyler and Mike 
took the lead.

525
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,350
Carolyn goes to 3rd.

526
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,700
This is Sierra. This is Dan.

527
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,730
This obstacle must be overcome.

528
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,360
Joe passed the 3rd.

529
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,620
Joe attacks the sliding puzzle.

530
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,280
Shirin passed the 3rd.

531
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,740
Tyler passed the 3rd.

532
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,400
This is Sierra.

533
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,550
This is Mike.

534
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,730
Everyone passes now. 
This is Dan.

535
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,370
This is Will.

536
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,040
Jenn joins them.

537
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,750
The only ones out of it are Rodney

538
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,750
and Hali.

539
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,940
Now complete the puzzle. 
When it's good, you'll know.

540
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,550
Shirin predicted 
that she would be good.

541
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,660
That remains to be seen.

542
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,540
Dan is fully into the puzzle.

543
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,240
Rodney finally arrives at his puzzle.

544
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,370
Hali arrives at his.

545
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,420
Joe would love to win 
a 3rd time in a row.

546
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,770
I got it !

547
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,110
Dan thinks it's good.

548
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,070
- You have it ! Well done, Dan! 
- Cheer.

549
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,270
And ...

550
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,820
...is wrong !

551
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,040
Everyone stays in the game.

552
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,170
You have to be fast AND be right

553
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,680
to win this race.

554
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,180
Joe won the first two 
individual events.

555
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,900
Can he win three times in a row?

556
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,000
Now !

557
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,670
Dan thinks it's good now.

558
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,570
Dan is wrong again!

559
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,620
Bon sang!

560
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,500
Dan thought he found it twice, 
he was wrong both times,

561
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,060
giving others a chance.

562
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,800
Mike is making progress.

563
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,500
Jeff, Jeff!

564
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,910
Joe thinks it's good.

565
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,390
Joe found it!

566
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,650
Joe wins immunity! 
3 individual victories in a row!

567
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,370
Joe, come closer!

568
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,670
Well done, Joe!

569
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,980
Once again, 
individual immunity is for Joe,

570
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,740
undefeated in 
three consecutive events.

571
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,430
If you weren't scary before, 
now you are.

572
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,070
- Thanks, Jeff... 
- Joe, safe again tonight.

573
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,860
to the council. As for you,

574
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,290
after 22 very rough days 
in this game,

575
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,050
someone will leave tonight.

576
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,080
Take your things, 
return to camp.

577
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,090
See you tonight at the council. 
Congratulation.

578
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,610
Joe won. That's all 
he does: win events.

579
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,490
A real prototype 
of pure white American.

580
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,440
Who wouldn't want him 
to win Survivor?

581
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,850
If it had been my choice, 
Joaquin would have made it.

582
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,320
There wouldn't be all this cinema.

583
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,540
It would be easy 
to eat rice and beans.

584
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,500
But we will have to activate 
in all directions, because of Mike.

585
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,660
Today I was offered a trial 
on a silver platter, puzzles,

586
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,970
and... Joe wins.

587
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,950
Joe wins it all.

588
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,180
I would love to win an event, 
it would be an accomplishment.

589
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,430
But at this point 
everyone thinks

590
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,000
that I am harmless, 
weak in everything,

591
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,170
and I hope it will 
save me a few days of play.

592
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,980
I'm not too worried.

593
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,070
Shirin, hein?

594
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,850
If everyone 
agrees, that's fine with me.

595
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,830
He thinks Shirin has the idol.

596
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,070
I do not think so.

597
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,830
From where ?

598
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,190
- From the yellow camp. 
- From your side.

599
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,190
I say that because

600
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,970
I saw her fight 
until the last day,

601
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,570
- searching the hills... 
- Exactly.

602
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,820
...to confront Joaquin,

603
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,860
- yelling at him... 
- Yeah.

604
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,110
If each side had an idol,

605
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,630
where is the white collar one?

606
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,350
Carolyn and Tyler 
seem pretty sure

607
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,670
that Shirin doesn't have it.

608
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,040
Probably because 
she didn't mention it.

609
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,530
And I don't think she's a 
good enough player to shut up.

610
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,900
But maybe it is.

611
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,960
Maybe she 
's a learned idiot.

612
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,850
I'm leaning more towards the "dumb" side.

613
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,920
But Shirin... 
She will never win anything.

614
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,500
Very well. So who ?

615
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,380
These three Colorless.

616
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,990
- They're so close. 
- Just.

617
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,510
Remove a leg from this tripod

618
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,720
and it will collapse.

619
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,480
- Hali. 
- I say Hali.

620
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,210
- So Hali. 
- Looks like...

621
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,210
Looks like the majority 
wants to vote Shirin.

622
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,250
- I'm just afraid that... 
- I...

623
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,840
No one thought 
Jenn had an idol.

624
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,680
Dan came to see me, he said:

625
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,100
"I'm hallucinating, you're a fan 
and you can't count!".

626
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,340
- And I... 
- What?

627
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,950
"What ?" And he tells me that we are seen 
as Joe's puppets,

628
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,180
- and blah blah blah. 
- This guy is not well.

629
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,040
I would entrust my children 
to Rodney rather than to Dan.

630
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,740
What did Dan tell you?

631
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,100
Where to start ?

632
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,870
Eliminating Dan would be awesome.

633
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,770
He was unnecessarily 
hurtful to an adult.

634
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,790
I haven't forgiven him.

635
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,350
So to hear that others 
feel the same way about Dan

636
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,180
I go back to morality,

637
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,230
because it confirms to me 
that I am not crazy.

638
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,220
But we are missing a vote.

639
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,730
I want a girls alliance 
, no doubt.

640
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,290
That, I tell you.

641
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,640
My Blue alliance 
is aiming for a girl,

642
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,650
but is that really 
what i want to do?

643
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,000
I want girls at the end.

644
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,030
So I have to decide 
if I go with the girls

645
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,710
or if I stay 
with my Blue alliance.

646
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,420
Now is the time for the girls 
to put him on the spot.

647
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,760
Why not vote Dan?

648
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,730
OK.

649
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,880
I love the dynamic 
of this girl band.

650
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,620
Together we can 
strengthen each other.

651
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,720
And if Sierra joins us tonight, 
we need another vote

652
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,950
to fire Dan.

653
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,050
So let's fire Dan!

654
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,440
- OK, Dan. 
- OK.

655
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,020
Be misogynistic with girls

656
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,430
and the girls will eliminate you!

657
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,430
Dan!

658
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,290
I want to eliminate Dan.

659
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,450
Everyone wants to eliminate it. 
Everybody.

660
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,270
And then what happens?

661
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,130
After that, we reassemble, 
but there will be no more

662
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,550
a hefty alliance of Bleus 
and another of Sans Couleur.

663
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,580
We will have fired 
one of the pivots of the Blues.

664
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,360
Yeah.

665
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,960
- It's true. 
- This may be our last chance,

666
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,060
with this balance of power, 
to eliminate one of them.

667
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,490
They are in control, 
but how long can it last?

668
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,860
Some of my allies 
are very dangerous.

669
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,280
I would love to aim for Mike and Dan.

670
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,240
I support you !

671
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,740
I hope to strike before 
the Blues realize what is happening.

672
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,240
They don't owe you anything. 
You are a threat to them.

673
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,390
Tyler, what were the reactions 
on the camp after the last council,

674
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,290
where Jenn played her idol

675
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,360
and where all the jaws 
are unhooked?

676
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,470
Some were 
a little depressed, that's for sure.

677
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,000
Kelly was appreciated.

678
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,240
And there was talk of a 
chainsaw dividing this group.

679
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,770
But the lines were 
already blurring again, it was being discussed again.

680
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,560
It wasn't "them against us",

681
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,830
it was a large group 
of Survivors.

682
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,740
Sierra, is that your impression too?

683
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,580
Absolutely.

684
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,830
I don't think the line 
is firmly drawn.

685
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,460
I can choose 
the alliance that I want.

686
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,710
Mike, how 
sure are you of the vote,

687
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,820
of the outcome you imagine, 
with those with whom you think you will vote?

688
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,660
I'm 150,000% sure 
of what I'm going to do.

689
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,910
But we got 
a hell of a lot of players there,

690
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,470
and you all know what to say,

691
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,990
how to flatter 
the ears of others.

692
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,590
So, will you follow someone who 
maybe buys you pizza?

693
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,060
Or someone who provides 
food for you from the start?

694
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,770
Dan, after the last advice,

695
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:38,200
are you a little worried, given 
how quickly it can change?

696
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,380
As a big fan of the game, yes,

697
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,000
expect bombs.

698
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,020
We just hope they 
don't explode on you.

699
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,120
But you have to believe 
in your covenant and stick to it.

700
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,320
Five magic words, Jeff:

701
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,120
weathervanes never win.

702
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,090
Jeff, that's completely wrong.

703
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,270
The weathervanes win. 
Tony turned around a million times

704
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,440
and won brilliantly.

705
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,150
It's a scare tactic 
he uses on his allies .

706
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,870
so that no 
one votes against him.

707
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,950
Hali, five words: 
weather vanes never win.

708
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,590
Do you think he is stating a fact

709
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,680
or that it sends a message to those 
who would consider returning?

710
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,130
I think he's sending a message, 
but he has to remember

711
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,060
that we are the Merica tribe.

712
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,130
And if you look at history,

713
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,420
what if the settlers 
had never returned

714
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,420
against the greatest 
empire in the world?

715
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,590
You imagine ?

716
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,920
Since we are the Merica tribe,

717
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,900
the weathervanes have 
a superb historical base

718
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,640
to win this game.

719
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,760
- Absolutely. 
- Thanks.

720
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,740
Hey good!

721
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,470
Bright.

722
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,400
Pepper !

723
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,410
Good. It's time to vote.

724
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,850
Will, over to you.

725
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,250
You derailed.

726
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,690
I will count the votes.

727
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,050
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

728
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,070
now is the time to do it.

729
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,410
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

730
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,430
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

731
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,570
I will read the votes.

732
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,440
Dan.

733
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,800
Status.

734
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,030
Dan.

735
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:21,790
Status.

736
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,030
Equality. Two Dan votes, 
two Hali votes.

737
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,080
Dan. Three Dan votes.

738
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,920
New equality. Three Dan votes, 
three Hali votes.

739
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,790
Dan.

740
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,930
Status.

741
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,790
Halli. Five Hali votes, 
four Dan votes.

742
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,490
Eighth person eliminated 
and first member of the jury...

743
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,930
Halli. That's six, that's enough. 
Bring me your torch.

744
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,230
What is this mess ?

745
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,790
Sorry.

746
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,450
Sorry.

747
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,070
Hali, the tribe has spoken.

748
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,410
It's time to go.

749
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,100
I love you, Merca!

750
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,960
- Hey, Hali! 
- Hi !

751
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,390
Drink a beer to my health!

752
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:39,480
We talked a lot tonight 
about drawing lines in the sand.

753
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,360
With 10 players still in play,

754
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,690
the lines drawn tonight

755
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,820
could be washed out 
by the tide tomorrow.

756
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,400
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

759
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,940
Next time in Survivor....

760
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,580
Everyone takes hits.

761
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,300
Go Joe!

762
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,480
It's very strange to watch.

763
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,960
And someone is considering 
throwing in the towel.

764
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,090
It's not funny, 
people suck.

765
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,590
I have nothing left here 
except despair.

766
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,670
I was shocked, I did 
n't think I was leaving tonight.

767
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,090
I thought this girly thing 
was gonna work.

768
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,300
I got screwed.

769
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,570
Honestly I understand

770
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:46,590
why Sierra and those who 
voted for me did.

771
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,940
It's well played.

772
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,410
I'm ready to go get myself 
a whiskey

773
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,410
and a big bowl of ice cream.
