1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:07,090
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AFTER THE MERGE,

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,717
COLE WAS LOOKING TO GET THE
UPPER HAND.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,387
>> I'M LOOKING FOR A CLUE OR
SOME ADVANTAGE.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,098
>> Jeff: BUT THE HEROES AND
HUSTLERS CAME TOGETHER.

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,059
>> WE NEED A HEALER GONE FIRST.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,271
>> Jeff: PUTTING THE HEALERS
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,272
NUMBERS.

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,275
>> JOE PLAYS AN IDOL, I THINK WE
NEED A PLAN "B."

9
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,319
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
JOE THOUGHT HE WAS SAVING

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:28,778
HIMSELF.

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,948
>> THAT'S FOR ME.

12
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,700
>> Jeff: BUT THE REAL TARGET
WAS JESSICA.

13
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,827
>> JESSICA, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,539
>> Jeff: THANKS, JEFF.

15
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,082
>> Jeff: 11 ARE LEFT.

16
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:51,468
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

17
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,395
>> NOW I KNOW HOW IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE LIED TO BY EVERY SINGLE

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,980
PERSON.

19
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:04,439
WE'RE PLAYING "SURVIVOR."

20
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,150
>> THAT WAS MAGIC.

21
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,195
>> I KNOW THE HUSTLERS WANTED US
DOWN TO FOUR TO MAKE IT EVEN,

22
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,322
BUT I DIDN'T SEE JESS.

23
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,493
JESSICA GOT COMPLETELY BLIND
SIDED BY THE HEROES AND

24
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,076
HUSTLERS.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,495
THAT WAS AN AMAZING PLAY.

26
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,164
AS A FAN, YOU GOT TO APPRECIATE
THAT.

27
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,332
Y'ALL, THAT WAS GENIUS.

28
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,211
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS NOW YOU'RE
PLAYING WITH THE DEVIL.

29
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:31,341
>> LAUREN AND I PUT A PLAN IN
PLAY, AND WE EXECUTED IT.

30
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,802
WE GOT OUR TARGET OUT.

31
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,638
SO NOW IT WAS A GOOD FEELING.

32
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:41,392
IF I CAN KEEP THE REINS ON THIS
HERO-HUSTLER GROUP AND GET US TO

33
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,269
SEVEN, I'M GOOD, BUT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL PART,

34
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:53,321
BECAUSE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN MESS
THIS WHOLE THING UP.

35
00:01:53,404 --> 00:02:01,746
BECAUSE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN MESS
THIS WHOLE THING UP.

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,375
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN I WOKE UP THIS
MORNING, IT SEEMED LIKE THE END

37
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,543
OF THE WORLD.

38
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,378
IT WAS MY FIRST TRIBAL AND
EVERYBODY ELSE HAD BEEN THROUGH

39
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,879
IT, YOU KNOW?

40
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,715
AND NOW I GET IT.

41
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,968
>> DID YOU SEE THAT?

42
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,219
WHERE DID IT GO?

43
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:22,892
THAT'S CRAZY.

44
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:28,523
THIS MORNING I REACHED INTO
WHERE THE NAILS WERE AND A SAW A

45
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,441
LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER ROLLED UP
REALLY TIGHT.

46
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,735
IT'S A HIDDEN CLUE OR SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW?

47
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,906
I GUESS IT'S BEEN THERE SINCE WE
MERGED, AND THEN I WAS TRYING TO

48
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,908
MAKE SURE NOBODY WAS PAYING ME
ANY ATTENTION.

49
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,871
MY HEART STARTED BEATING
PROBABLY 150 BEATS PER SECOND.

50
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,415
>> CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE
FOUND AN ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME.

51
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,295
THIS ADVANTAGE ALLOWS YOU TO
SECRETLY NOT VOTE AT THE NEXT

52
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:55,592
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND INSTEAD SAVE
YOUR VOTE FOR USE AT A FUTURE

53
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,843
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

54
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:01,598
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: WHEN IT IS
YOUR TURN TO VOTE, DO NOT WRITE

55
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,266
DOWN A NAME.

56
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,979
INSTEAD SECRETLY PLACE THIS NOTE
INSIDE THE VOTING URN AND TAKE

57
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,399
THE BLANK VOTING PARCHMENT BACK
WITH YOU.

58
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:16,237
SO IF I USE IT AFTER TOMORROW, I
CAN VOTE TWICE.

59
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,616
THE HARD PART IS GOING TO BE
GETTING THIS ADVANTAGE IN THE

60
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,785
URN IN FRONT OF TEN OTHER
PEOPLE, AND HOPEFULLY NOBODY

61
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,288
WILL EVEN KNOW THERE WAS
SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T VOTE, BUT I

62
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,625
NEED TO MAKE SURE NO ONE SEES ME
DO IT, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT

63
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,337
COULD BLOW UP MY WHOLE GAME.

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:04:02,992
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

65
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,035
ALL RIGHT.

66
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,453
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE IN.

67
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,663
>> OH, YEAH.

68
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,999
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE
YOU'LL RACE UP A TOWER THROUGH A

69
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,878
SERIES OF OBSTACLES TO THE TOP,
WHERE YOU WILL USE A SLINGSHOT

70
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:22,220
TO ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH SANDBAGS
HITTING FIVE TARGETS.

71
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,056
THE FIRST TEAM TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.

72
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,183
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR PLAYING
FOR?

73
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,561
THE WINNING TEAM WILL BE TAKEN
TO A PRIVATE ISLAND, WHERE YOU

74
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,563
WILL ENJOY SPAGHETTI.

75
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,856
>> OH.

76
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,399
>> WOW.

77
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:34,732
>> Jeff: BREAD.

78
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,359
>> BREAD.

79
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,527
>> Jeff: SALAD.

80
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,695
>> OH, MY GOD.

81
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,362
>> Jeff: AND RED WINE.

82
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,364
>> NO WAY.

83
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,241
>> Jeff: THERE'S A TWIST.

84
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,534
WE'RE GOING TO RANDOMLY DRAW FOR
TEAMS.

85
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:49,706
THE ODD PERSON OUT WILL NOT
COMPETE IN THE CHALLENGE.

86
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,873
>> WOW.

87
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,252
>> Jeff: AND THEY WON'T HAVE
TO, BECAUSE AS THE SURVIVOR

88
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,880
LOTTERY WINNER, THEY WILL
AUTOMATICALLY JOIN THE WINNING

89
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,259
TEAM AND ENJOY THE REWARD
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING.

90
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:01,926
>> WOW.

91
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,094
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

92
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:03,886
WE'LL GET TO THIS.

93
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,224
>> THE LOTTERY.

94
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,267
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

95
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,894
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS RANDOMLY
CHOSEN.

96
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:17,358
IT IS J.P., CHRISSY, COLE, RYAN,
AND DEVON TAKING ON DESI,

97
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:22,363
ASHLEY, BEN, DR. MIKE, AND
LAUREN.

98
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,241
JOE DREW THE WHITE ROCK, WHICH
MEANS SPAGHETTI COMING HIS WAY

99
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,910
WITH NO EFFORT REQUIRED.

100
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,619
HERE WE GO.

101
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,415
FOR REWARD, SURVIVORS READY?

102
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,252
GO!

103
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:39,589
WITH ONE PERSON UP AT A TIME,
IT'S GOING TO BE BEN UP FIRST

104
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,299
AND RYAN, NECK AND NECK.

105
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,426
EVERYONE HAS TO RACE THROUGH THE
COURSE AND SHOOT AT LEAST ONCE.

106
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,388
NOW YOU'RE UP THE MORE TRICKY
LADDER, THE ROPE LADDER.

107
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,514
BEN GETS TO THE TOP QUICKLY.

108
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:48,931
RYAN RIGHT THERE.

109
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,558
START LAUNCHING.

110
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:55,772
BEN BACK QUICKLY AND RELEASES.

111
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,023
JUST TO THE LEFT.

112
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,566
THERE GOES RYAN.

113
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,776
FALLS SHORT.

114
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,235
HE'S GOING TO HEAD DOWN.

115
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,404
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHOOT AGAIN.

116
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,781
BEN QUICKLY GETTING A FEEL FOR
IT.

117
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,491
NOW HE'S ZONED IN ON THESE
TARGETS.

118
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,118
CHRISSY HEADING UP FOR A CLUE.

119
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,286
BEN FIRES AGAIN.

120
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,746
VERY QUICKLY.

121
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,663
JUST TO THE RIGHT.

122
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,457
IT'S NOW CHRISSY FOR BLUE.

123
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,417
>> HARD, CHRISSY, HARD.

124
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,960
>> Jeff: MISSES TO THE LEFT.

125
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,420
CHRISSY NOW GOING TO HEAD DOWN.

126
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,254
SHE'S TAKEN HER SHOT.

127
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,092
BLUE WITH A VERY INTERESTING
STRATEGY.

128
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,676
BEN CONNECTS FOR RED.

129
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,596
ONCE YOU HIT, YOU GOT TO LET
SOMEBODY ELSE TAKE A SHOT.

130
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,433
IT'S NOW J.P. UP FOR BLUE.

131
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,479
RYAN AND CHRISSY BOTH TOOK ONE
SHOT, TRYING TO OPEN THE DOOR

132
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,606
FOR THEIR EXPERIENCED SLINGSHOT
SLINGERS.

133
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,858
RED WITH ONE.

134
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,861
BLUE LOOKING FOR THEIR FIRST.

135
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,154
>> ALMOST, J.T.

136
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:49,951
>> Jeff: DR. MIKE GOING FOR A
CLOSE ONE, AND HE CONNECTS.

137
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,828
THAT'S TWO FOR RED.

138
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,162
J.P. HITS FOR BLUE.

139
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:53,788
IT IS 2-1.

140
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,541
HERE COMES COLE FOR BLUE.

141
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,667
LAUREN FOR RED.

142
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,379
BIG REWARD ON THE LINE.

143
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,880
SPAGHETTI ON A PRIVATE ISLAND.

144
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,175
LAUREN TAKES THAT SLINGSHOT
BACK.

145
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,385
LAUREN CONNECTS FOR RED.

146
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,679
THAT IS THREE FOR RED.

147
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,141
THE PRESSURE ON COLE, TRYING TO
CLOSE THIS GAP.

148
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,144
HERE COMES ASHLEY NOW.

149
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,521
CALORIES ARE IMPORTANT, AND COLE
FIRES.

150
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,189
NO, COLE'S GOING TO COME DOWN.

151
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,399
HERE COMES DEVON.

152
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,818
A MASSIVE SETBACK FOR BLUE.

153
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,904
ASHLEY'S FIRST SHOT SHORT.

154
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,367
HERE GOES DEVON LAUNCHING DEEP,
AND HE CONNECTS ON HIS FIRST

155
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,161
SHOT FOR BLUE.

156
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,704
EVERYBODY HAS GONE FOR BLUE.

157
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,080
NOW ANYBODY CAN GO.

158
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,415
HERE COMES J.P.

159
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,041
IT IS 3-2.

160
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,043
ASHLEY STILL FIRING FOR RED.

161
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,712
SHE IS SHORT AGAIN.

162
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,213
>> FURTHER BACK, ASH.

163
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,883
>> Jeff: COME ON, J.P.

164
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:52,930
J.P. LOOKING THE TAG ANOTHER ONE
RIGHT HERE.

165
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,724
AND 3-3, J.P. HEADS DOWN.

166
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,185
HERE COMES DEVON AGAIN.

167
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,354
ASHLEY TRYING TO PUT RED BACK IN
THE LEAD.

168
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,522
CAN SHE DO IT?

169
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,400
JUST MISSES.

170
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:04,817
IT'S DEVON NOW FOR BLUE.

171
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,738
WE'RE TIED 3-3.

172
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,447
DEVON CONNECTS.

173
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,823
BLUE IN THE LEAD NOW WITH FOUR.

174
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,743
ASHLEY NOW FEELING THE PRESSURE.

175
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,244
HERE COMES J.P.

176
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,621
>> ONE MORE, BABY.

177
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,663
>> Jeff: HE'S BEEN ON FIRE IN
THIS CHALLENGE.

178
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:22,919
CAN HE CLOSE IT OUT FOR BLUE
RIGHT HERE?

179
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,254
ASHLEY'S GOT TO PICK IT UP NOW.

180
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,422
>> COME ON, J.P.

181
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:32,094
>> Jeff: J.P. WOULD LIKE THE
CLOSE THE DOOR WITH THIS SHOT.

182
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,098
ASHLEY CONNECTS.

183
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,808
>> Jeff: IT WON'T MATTER.

184
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,602
J.P. WINS IT FOR BLUE.

185
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:48,527
HUGE REWARD FOR J.P., DEVON,
CHRISSY, COLE, AND RYAN.

186
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,282
AND JOE WILL BE JOINING THEM.

187
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,242
ALL RIGHT.

188
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,786
SO THERE'S SOMETHING UNIQUE
ABOUT THIS REWARD.

189
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,624
IT'S GOING TO BE SERVED
FAMILY-STYLE, WHICH MEANS ONE

190
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:07,838
LARGE PORTION TO BE SHARED, AND
YOU WILL EAT ONE PERSON AT A

191
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,300
TIME ALONE IN PRIVATE.

192
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,304
SO IT'S UP TO YOU HOW MUCH YOU
EAT AND SAVE FOR THE NEXT

193
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,683
PERSON, AND BECAUSE IT'S IN
PRIVATE, NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW.

194
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,810
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT.

195
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,104
>> Jeff: ONE FINAL TWIST.

196
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,816
JOE, AS THE SURVIVOR LOTTERY
WINNER, YOU WILL DECIDE IN WHAT

197
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,944
ORDER EVERYONE EATS, INCLUDING
YOURSELF.

198
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,947
IT SHOULD MAKE FOR A VERY FUN
AFTERNOON.

199
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,700
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, ENJOY
YOUR REWARD.

200
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,994
>> OH, MAN.

201
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,122
>> Jeff: MIKE, ASHLEY, BEN,
LAUREN, DESI, GOT NOTHING FOR

202
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:41,914
YOU.

203
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,082
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

204
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:47,086
>> RIGHT NOW I DO HAVE TARGET ON
MY BACK, SO I NEED TO MAKE

205
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,380
ADJUSTMENTS IN MY GAME, AND THIS
IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

206
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:54,510
ESTABLISH BETTER RELATIONSHIPS
AND STRONGER ALLIANCES.

207
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,609
>> SO, GUYS, WHAT I WAS THINKING
WAS DEVON GOES FIRST, BECAUSE

208
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,321
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY, AND I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING BUT SIT THERE AND

209
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,364
GOT FRONT-ROW SEATS, SO I'LL
DEFINITELY GO LAST.

210
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,700
I PUT MYSELF LAST BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT AN ADDITIONAL POWER

211
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,747
ON MY BACK, AND WHO HAS THE
POWER, THE HUSTLERS.

212
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,207
I HAVE A DECENT RELATIONSHIP
WITH DEVON, SO I GAVE HIM FIRST

213
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,417
DIBS ON EATING.

214
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,545
IF I CAN CONTINUE DEVELOPING A
RELATIONSHIP WITH DEVON, THAT

215
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:34,383
WILL BENEFIT ME DEFINITELY IN
THE LONG RUN.

216
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,885
>> OH, MY GOD.

217
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,388
>> THIS IS LIKE THE PERFECT DATE
BY MYSELF.

218
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,057
OH, MY GOSH, THERE'S TONS.

219
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,932
OH.

220
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,726
>> WHEN I WALKED INTO THAT
SPAGHETTI FEAST.

221
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,562
I FELT LIKE THERE WAS A LITTLE
PRESSURE ON ME BEING FIRST ONE.

222
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,899
KNOWING THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS
COUNTING ON ME TO SET THE BAR

223
00:10:49,982 --> 00:11:00,659
FOR HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO EAT.

224
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,623
OH, MAN, I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

225
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,916
THIS IS INSANE.

226
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,086
SO I WAS JUST SHOVING EACH BITE
IN MY FACE.

227
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,587
BUT I FELL LIKE I WAS FAIR.

228
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,757
I MEAN, I MIGHT HAVE EATEN A
LITTLE MORE THAN MY FAIR SHARE.

229
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:24,100
BUT WHEN THERE'S THAT MUCH FOOD,
IT'S HARD TO STOP.

230
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,937
>> I GOT TO GO EAT SECOND, BUT I
WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED GOING LAST

231
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,065
BECAUSE IF IT'S LEFTOVER, YOU
GOT TO FINISH IT OFF, BUT YOU

232
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,942
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY
GETS THEIR FAIR SHARE AND IT ALL

233
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,193
WORKS OUT.

234
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,322
ALL IN ALL, BY NO MEANS WAS I
FAT AND HAPPY, BUT IT IS WHAT IT

235
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,281
IS.

236
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:46,914
TAKE YOUR PORTION AND LEAVE IT
FOR NEXT PERSON.

237
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:51,502
>> I THINK J.P. AND DEVON MAY
HAVE INDULGED A LITTLE MORE THAN

238
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,086
THEIR FAIR SHARE.

239
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,295
I DON'T BLAME THEM.

240
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,463
I'M GOING TO DO THE SAME THING.

241
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,633
I KNOW I'M ON THE BOTTOM, SO
I'LL GET BACK TO ALL THESE

242
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:05,808
PEOPLE THAT STABBED ME IN THE
BACK AND EAT AS MUCH AS I WANT.

243
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,936
>> THERE'S WRITING ON THE BOTTOM
OF THE PLATE.

244
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,815
IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE AN IDOL
BURIED UNDERNEATH YOUR TRIBE

245
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,941
FLAG.

246
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,527
SO I'M THINKING I MAY BE FIRST
PERSON TO SEE THIS CLUE.

247
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,781
I KNOW I NEEDED TO FIND SOME WAY
THE HIDE THIS CLUES.

248
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,826
SO I USED AN APRON THAT WAS
WRAPPED AROUND THE BREAD AND

249
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:31,333
COVER IT UP AND MAKE IT LOOK AS
NATURAL AS POSSIBLE.

250
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,127
>> I DIDN'T REALIZE I DON'T GET
A PLATE.

251
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,672
>> I'M A STUDENT OF THIS GAME
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THERE IS

252
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,217
GENERALLY A CLUE TO BE FOUND AT
A REWARD.

253
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,012
SO I BEGIN THE LOOK AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SALAD BOWL, UNWRAP

254
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,139
THE EXTRA SILVERWARE.

255
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,016
KIND OF LOOKED AROUND, LOOKED AT
THE TREES AROUND ME.

256
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,892
DIDN'T SEE A CLUE.

257
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:58,694
SO I CONTINUED TO EAT.

258
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,740
THERE IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
BURIED UNDER YOUR TRIBE FLAG.

259
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,699
UH NIGH IT WAS HERE.

260
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,368
>> I THINK I AM THE FIRST ONE TO
SEE THIS CLUE.

261
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:13,250
AND I'M HOPING THAT RYAN WILL
ALSO FIND THE CLUE.

262
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,044
>> SPAGHETTI IS GREAT.

263
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,045
KIDS CLAMOR FOR THE TASTE OF
SPAGHETTI.

264
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,046
I LIKE SPAGHETTI.

265
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,714
IT'S FINE.

266
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,715
CAESAR SALAD IS OKAY.

267
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:26,222
BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR A CLUE.

268
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,389
VERY DIRECT.

269
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,559
IF YOU SEE THIS CLUE, YOU DO NOT
HAVE TO BE A MASTERMIND TO

270
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,685
FIGURE THIS OUT.

271
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:37,066
SO THE LESS PEOPLE WHO KNOW
ABOUT THE PLATE, THE BETTER.

272
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,070
I HAVE SEARCHED FOR THE IDOL FOR
20-PLUS DAYS NOW AND GOT

273
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:41,737
NOTHING.

274
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,447
NOW I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE ONE IS.

275
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,910
SO IF I DON'T FIND IT, I WOULD
NEVER BE ABLE TO SWALLOW THAT.

276
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,036
>> OH, HERE'S RYAN.

277
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,913
>> OH, MAN.

278
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,748
>> I'M OUT.

279
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,457
I'M HUNGRY, Y'ALL.

280
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,084
>> LICK THAT THING CLEAN, BRO.

281
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,211
>> DON'T LEAVE A CRUMB.

282
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:57,753
>> I WON'T.

283
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,046
>> HOW WAS IT FOR YOU?

284
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:11,475
>> IT WAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT
FOR ME.

285
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:18,774
>> WHAT DO WE DO?

286
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,150
>> WHAT'S THE WHISPERING ABOUT?

287
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,153
>> JUST QUIET WHISPERS.

288
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:23,946
>> NOTHING REALLY?

289
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,030
>> OH, YEAH.

290
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,575
>> CHRISSY AND RYAN WERE
DEFINITELY TALKING ABOUT THE

291
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,826
CREW.

292
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,202
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THEY WOULD
WHISPER THAT QUIETLY ABOUT RIGHT

293
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,370
NEXT TO ME.

294
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,956
I COULD DEFINITELY BEAT OUT
CHRISSY AND RYAN IN A DIGGING

295
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,127
CHALLENGE, SO IF PUSH COMES TO
SHOVE, I'LL HAVE THE BIGGER PUSH

296
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,130
AND SHOVE, AND I DON'T FEEL BAD
ABOUT GOING ALL OUT FOR THE

297
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:54,935
IDOL.

298
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,649
>> KNOWING THAT THE IMMUNITY
IDOL IS RIGHT UNDER THE FLAG, MY

299
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,151
HEART IS BEATING OUT OF MY
CHEST.

300
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,238
I HAVE TO JUST WAIT FOR A MOMENT
TO BREAK AWAY.

301
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,990
>> IT WASN'T A FEAST BY ANY
MEANS.

302
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,326
WE WERE EATING OFF THE SAME
PLATE.

303
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,327
IT WAS FUNNY.

304
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,996
>> WAS THERE A LOT OF BREAD AT
LEAST OR SALADS?

305
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,499
>> THERE WAS A BAGGETT THAT WAS
PROBABLY 12 INCHES.

306
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,751
>> IT WAS GOOD, THOUGH.

307
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:23,339
>> WE WERE TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT
THE REWARD, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

308
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,718
COLE GOES TO PEE, AND I'M
THINKING, THIS IS IT.

309
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,178
THIS IS WHERE I HAVE TO STRIKE.

310
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,140
WHEN COLE IS LITERALLY CAUGHT
WITH HIS PANTS DOWN, I'M GOING

311
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:43,817
TO DIG UP THIS IDOL.

312
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,070
>> DID YOU PORTION IT OUT?

313
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,321
>> I GUESS SOME.

314
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:51,367
>> I JUST TOOK WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS A SIXTH AND TRUSTED EVERYONE

315
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:59,208
ELSE TO DO THE SAME.

316
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,834
>> COVER THAT BACK UP.

317
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,169
>> COVER THAT BACK UP.

318
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:11,220
I GOT IT.

319
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:17,017
>> DESI, DESI, COME HERE, COME
HERE.

320
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:24,358
J.P., J.P.

321
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,192
>> WHAT'S WRONG?

322
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,236
>> AN IDOL.

323
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,946
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WRESTLE
OVER THIS.

324
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:34,034
>> I AM STANDING THERE WITH THE
IDOL IN MY LITTLE PINK SHORTS,

325
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,745
AND PANDEMONIUM IS ENSUING IN
FRONT OF ME.

326
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,248
>> WAIT, WHY IS EVERYONE
DIGGING.

327
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,958
COLE, DID YOU FIND THE CLUE?

328
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,042
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.

329
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,796
I WAS REALLY THE ONLY ONE WHO
KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAD

330
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,213
TRANSPIRED.

331
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,131
>> OH, MY GOD.

332
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,382
OH, MY GOD.

333
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,719
>> GUYS, YOU'RE ABOUT TO KILL
ME, ALL FOR AN IDOL.

334
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,262
>> COLE'S GOT IT.

335
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,263
HE JUST SHOVED IT DOWN HIS
PANTS.

336
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,598
I JUST SAW HIM DO IT.

337
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,517
HE TUCKED HIS SHIRT.

338
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,436
COLE IS DIGGING HIS OWN GRAVE AT
THIS POINT.

339
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,772
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR ENEMIES TO
KNOW YOU HAVE THE IDOL.

340
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,191
HE BLATANTLY WENT OUT THERE
RUNNING AND STARTED DIGGING.

341
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,279
>> PROBABLY WASN'T THE SMARTEST
THING, BUT CHRISSY WAS GOING TO

342
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,238
GET IT IF I DIDN'T GO.

343
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,657
>> WELL YOU GOT IT NOW, AND
EVERYONE KNOWS.

344
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,825
>> SO?

345
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,243
WHAT ELSE WAS I GOING TO DO?

346
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,537
>> I DON'T LIKE COLE.

347
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,788
HE RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY.

348
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,791
IF COLE HAS THE IDOL, EVERYONE
NEEDS TO KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S ONE

349
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,501
OF THE MAIN TARGETS.

350
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,463
I DON'T CARE, I'LL BLOW HIS GAME
OUT.

351
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,340
>> I SAW YOU TUCK YOUR SHIRT
INTO YOUR PANTS.

352
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,134
>> IT'S A LONG SHIRT, DUDE.

353
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,138
>> WHY WOULD YOU TUCK YOUR SHIRT
INTO YOUR PANTS?

354
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,307
>> BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A DRESS.

355
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,309
IT'S A COMPLETE DISASTER AT THIS
POINT.

356
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,936
EVERYONE THINKS I HAVE AN IDOL,
BUT I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.

357
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,650
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN BIG TROUBLE,
SO BLUFFING I HAVE THE IDOL IS

358
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,485
THE ONLY THING I HAVE LEFT
UNLESS I CAN WIN IMMUNITY.

359
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,404
THAT WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER FOR
ME.

360
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:17,221
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

361
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:21,391
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?

362
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:27,064
FIRST THINGS FIRST, DESI, GOT TO
TAKE IT BACK.

363
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:32,319
THANK YOU.

364
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,364
ONCE AGAIN IMMONTI IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

365
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,201
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO STAND ON A NARROW BEAM

366
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:44,206
WHILE BALANCING A STATUE WITH A
VERY LONG POLE.

367
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,251
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU WILL
MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE

368
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,044
STATUE, MAKING IT MORE
DIFFICULT.

369
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:54,258
IF AT ANY POINT YOU DROP OFF OR
YOUR STATUE FALLS, YOU'RE OUT.

370
00:18:54,341 --> 00:19:01,056
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE AT THE VOTE.

371
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:04,393
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE EIGHTH

372
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,061
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

373
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,437
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

374
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:12,276
WE'LL GET STARTED.

375
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,735
ALL RIGHT.

376
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,279
HERE WE GO.

377
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,616
EVERYBODY IS BALANCING THEIR
STATUE.

378
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,413
THIS CHALLENGE IS NOW OFFICIALLY
ON.

379
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,332
YOU'LL BE IN THIS SECTION FOR
TEN MINUTES.

380
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,670
THEN WE WILL MOVE FURTHER BACK
ON THE BEAM.

381
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,465
IT DOES NOT TAKING MUCH TO KNOCK
THAT STATUE OVER.

382
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,303
ONE LITTLE MOVEMENT AND YOUR
GAME COULD BE OVER.

383
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,515
>> I HAVE A BUG CRAWLING RIGHT
UP MY BODY.

384
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,100
>> SMACK IT.

385
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,060
>> Jeff: SEEMS TO BE A THEME
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

386
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:57,404
LAST TIME WE DID THIS THERE WERE
ANTS CRAWLING ON PEOPLE.

387
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,406
MIKE DROPS, FIRST PERSON OUT OF
THIS CHALLENGE.

388
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,492
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

389
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:08,916
MIKE TAKES A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

390
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,460
JOE OUT OF NOWHERE DROPS.

391
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,169
HAD HAD NO MOVEMENT.

392
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,964
JOE IS OUT; NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

393
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,590
SHE'S VULNERABLE AT TRIBAL.

394
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,925
>> YOU'RE KILLING ME, JEFF.

395
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,135
>> Jeff: WE'RE DOWN TO NINE.

396
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,721
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND SOME SWEET
SPOT WITHOUT TAKING YOUR

397
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:28,477
CONCENTRATION OFF THAT BEAM THAT
YOU'RE STANDING ON.

398
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,981
DEVON FALLS OFF THE BEAM,
BECOMES THE THIRD PERSON OUT OF

399
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:33,982
THIS CHALLENGE.

400
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:39,029
WE ARE DOWN TO EIGHT, AND AS
ALWAYS, AT AN IMMUNITY

401
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:42,282
CHALLENGE, THE ONLY WAY TO
GUARANTEE YOU SEE TOMORROW IS TO

402
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,117
WIN.

403
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,496
RYAN, THAT HEARTIS BEATING
THROUGH YOUR CHEST.

404
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:52,125
I CAN SEE IT.

405
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,337
LAUREN WITH ONE LITTLE MOVEMENT
DROPS HER STATUE.

406
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,505
LAUREN IS OUT.

407
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:04,721
WE ARE NOW DOWN TO SEVEN LEFT IN
THIS CHALLENGE.

408
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,350
RYAN CAN'T HANG IN ANYMORE, AN
WE ARE DOWN TO SIX.

409
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,020
ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN
THIS ROUND, AND WE WILL MOVE

410
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:22,114
FURTHER BACK ON THE BEAM.

411
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:29,496
FURTHER BACK ON THE BEAM.

412
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,458
EVERYBODY HAS NOW
MOVED BACK ONE

413
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,334
SECTION.

414
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,839
BEN, DESI, COLE, CHRISSY, J.P.,
ASHLEY.

415
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:44,594
THAT BEAM VERY NARROW, VERY
TOUGH TO KEEP YOUR BALANCE.

416
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,848
ASHLEY ONLY LASTS A COUPLE OF
SECONDS IN THIS SECTION.

417
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,435
WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE PEOPLE LEFT
NOW IN THIS IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

418
00:21:51,518 --> 00:22:00,527
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS VERY, VERY
DIFFICULT.

419
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:06,950
BEN NOW WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
MOVEMENT.

420
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,453
BEN GOT IT BACK UNDER CONTROL.

421
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:13,415
NICE RECOVERY.

422
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,461
J.P. STRUGGLING WITH THE FEET.

423
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,590
J.P. TRYING TO GET IT BACK UNDER
CONTROL.

424
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:27,554
NICE RECOVERY, AND J.P.'S BACK
SOLID.

425
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:34,227
COLE'S FEET MOVING.

426
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:34,895
COLE RECOVERS.

427
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,479
NICE WORK.

428
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:39,608
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

429
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,653
CHRISSY OUT OF NOWHERE, LOOKED
VERY SOLID, AND DROPS.

430
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,448
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.

431
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:51,828
IT IS BEN, DESI, COLE, AND J.P.

432
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:55,791
DESI WON THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, AND SHE IS IN THE

433
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:03,131
RUNNING AGAIN.

434
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,258
BEN CANNOT HANG ON ANY LONGER.

435
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,511
BEN DROPS, AND WE ARE DOWN TO
THREE.

436
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:15,644
IT IS DESI ON ONE END, COLE AND
J.P. AT THE OTHER END.

437
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,354
DESI LOOKING VERY SOLID.

438
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:21,191
NO EXPRESSION.

439
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,318
COLE LOCKED IN.

440
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:32,369
J.P. FEET STILL MOVING.

441
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,161
DESI DROPS.

442
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,164
DESI WILL NOT KEEP HER STREAK
ALIVE.

443
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,292
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

444
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,046
COLE AND J.P.

445
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,884
J.P. WITH A HUGE RECOVERY, A LOT
OF MOVEMENT ON THAT STATUE.

446
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,679
J.P. STRUGGLING TO STAY UP
THERE.

447
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,139
>> YOU GOT IT.

448
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,307
>> Jeff: HIS STATUE HAS MOVED
A LOT.

449
00:23:54,391 --> 00:24:00,564
THAT BASE IS NOW ON THE EDGE.

450
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,023
ANOTHER NICE SAVE BY J.P.

451
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,652
NOW COLE IS MOVING.

452
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:14,578
MORE MOVEMENT NOW BY COLE.

453
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:21,042
COLE STILL MOVING.

454
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,212
J.P. DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO
FALLING OUT, AND HE DOES.

455
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,672
J.P. IS OUT.

456
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:30,051
COLE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

457
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:40,061
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

458
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,606
[APPLAUSE]
COLE, COME ON OVER.

459
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,273
NICE JOB.

460
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,525
>> I'M HAVING TROUBLE WALKING.

461
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,736
>> Jeff: REALLY, LEGS ARE
STILL RUBBING?

462
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,778
>> I GOT THOSE CHICKEN LEGS.

463
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,447
>> Jeff: COLE SAFE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

464
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,573
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT.

465
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:57,370
AS FOR EVERYONE ELSE, 21 DAYS
INTO A 39-DAY ADVENTURE,

466
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,372
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE EIGHTH
PERSON VOTED OUT.

467
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,707
IT WILL NOT BE YOU.

468
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,500
CONGRATS.

469
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,959
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

470
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,920
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

471
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,714
>> IT TOTALLY SUCKS THAT COLE
WON IMMUNITY.

472
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,926
BUT WE STILL HAVE THREE OTHER

473
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,971
THE HUSTLERS AND THE HEROES JUST
IS

474
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,683
HAVE TO DECIDE WHO WE WANT TO
VOTE OUT NEXT.

475
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:34,282
>> GOOD JOB, COLE.

476
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,576
>> MY TOE IS ON FIRE.

477
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,788
>> WELL DONE.

478
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,499
>> THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WAS
THE BOMB.

479
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:42,958
I CAME OUT ON TOP.

480
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,501
I HAVE NEW LIFE.

481
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,253
I AM SO STOKED TO BE HERE AGAIN.

482
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,129
I WAS GETTING PRETTY BUMMED OUT.

483
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,674
I WAS THINKING I WAS LEAVING
TONIGHT, SO TO WIN THAT

484
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,635
CHALLENGE PUT ME ON TOP OF THE
WORLD, HOWEVER, I DEFINITELY

485
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,430
FEEL LIKE THE HEALERS A SINKING
SHIP AT THIS POINT, AND IF WE

486
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:03,687
DON'T DO SOMETHING SOON, WE'RE
GOING TO BE IN A BAD, BAD PLACE.

487
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,480
>> NOW WHAT?

488
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,107
>> WE'RE GOOD.

489
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,989
>> ALL THE GIRLS VOTE JOE, AND
ALL THE GUYS VOTE FOR DESI.

490
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,199
COLE WINNING IMMUNITY CHANGES
EVERYTHING.

491
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,827
THE PLAN IS TO SWITCH THE VOTE
BETWEEN JOE AND DESI.

492
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,122
THE FACT HE'S ALREADY FOUND AND
PLAYED TWO IDOLS.

493
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,874
JOE IS A GAMER, AND THE LONGER
JOE STAYS IN THE GAME, THE MORE

494
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,670
CHANCE HE HAS TO FIND ANOTHER
ONE.

495
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,006
AND DESI, SHE'S PHYSICALLY
STRONG.

496
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,340
SHE'S MENTALLY STRONG.

497
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,510
AND SHE CAN COMPETE WITH THE
BEST OF US.

498
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:39,222
WE CAN'T PUT ALL OUR EGGS IN ONE
BASKET, BECAUSE DESI WILL

499
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:39,556
COMPETE.

500
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,890
>> I KNOW.

501
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:41,516
DESI'S STRONG.

502
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,684
>> SO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT?

503
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,355
>> WELL, IT'S SURVIVOR AND
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, BUT I THINK

504
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:53,236
WE'LL BE GOOD.

505
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,072
>> DUDE, I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.

506
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:56,656
>> DAMN.

507
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,870
>> SORRY.

508
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,332
>> WITH COLE OFF THE CHOPPING
BLOCK, THEY'RE PROBABLY TRYING

509
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,376
TO VOTE ME OUT, BUT I STILL HAVE
ANGLES TO PLAY, BECAUSE AT THIS

510
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,340
POINT IT'S FOUR HEALERS, FOUR
HEROES, AND IT'S A MATTER OF WHO

511
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,716
WE CAN SWAY TO THE HUSTLERS.

512
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,760
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PLAN
SHOULD BE?

513
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:21,014
>> I THINK THE HEROES THINK I
HAVE AN IDOL I MIGHT PLAY FOR

514
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,557
SOMEBODY, SO THEY MAY SPLIT
VOTES.

515
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,144
IF THEY SPLIT AND VOTE, WE NEED
ONE PERSON TO VOTE.

516
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:34,402
WE CAN SEND SOMEONE HOME.

517
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,905
>> HERE'S THE THING, WHO IS
CALLING THE SHOTS RIGHT NOW IS

518
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,866
THE CONCERN THAT I'VE HAD SINCE
THE VERY BEGINNING.

519
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,912
I UNDERSTAND IT'S EASY TO VOTE
ME OUT BECAUSE BEN IS CALLING

520
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,955
THE SHOTS, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW EVERYONE IS ALLOWLING BEN TO

521
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,207
REGULATE.

522
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,418
THE DUDE IS JUST RUNNING THIS
THING, AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE, IF

523
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,630
YOU ALL GO TO THE FINAL THREE,
I'M LETTING YOU ALL KNOW, YOU

524
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:53,922
ARE NOT GOING TO BEAT BEN.

525
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,631
>> YEAH.

526
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,133
>> WHAT JOE IS PITCHING IS TRUE.

527
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,136
IF BEN GETS TO THE FINAL THREE,
HE VERY WELL COULD WIN.

528
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,429
HE'S GOT A GREAT STORY.

529
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,516
HE'S A FORMER MARINE, AND HE'S
JUST A GOOD GUY.

530
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,769
SO I DON'T WANT THE TAKE BEN TO
THE FINAL THREE, HOWEVER, IF I

531
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,481
VOTE OFF BEN, THAT WOULD BE
BETRAYING CHRISSY, WHO REALLY

532
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,651
TRUSTS ME, SO NOW IS NOT THE
RIGHT TIME.

533
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,944
>> SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

534
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,820
>> YEAH.

535
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:17,779
>> I'M GOING TO GO FIGURE OUT
SOME STUFF.

536
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,948
>> ALL RIGHT.

537
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,452
>> JUST LIKE I THOUGHT, JOE IS
TRYING TO PUT A TARGET ON MY

538
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,453
BACK.

539
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,121
NOPE.

540
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,583
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT GUY.

541
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,920
>> JOE-JOE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TONIGHT, BUD?

542
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,672
PLAYING ANOTHER IDOL?

543
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,339
>> MAYBE.

544
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,132
I DON'T KNOW.

545
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,341
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

546
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,846
>> THERE ARE BIGGER THREATS THAN
JUST AN IDOL HOG LIKE MYSELF.

547
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,139
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT LIE.

548
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,181
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT SWEAR ON
THINGS.

549
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,934
YOU SWORE ON YOUR MARINES TO
THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

550
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,644
>> WHO?

551
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:49,978
WHO?

552
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:50,812
WHO?

553
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,479
NO I DIDN'T.

554
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,982
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GO BACK.

555
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,442
>> I'M TELLING YOU I DIDN'T.

556
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,486
I DID NOT SWEAR ON THE MARINE
CORPS TO ANYONE, SO IF PEOPLE

557
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,280
ARE SAYING, THAT THEY'RE LYING
TO YOU.

558
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:00,864
AND I'M BEING SERIOUS NOW.

559
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,823
NOW I'M TALKING.

560
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,992
>> BEN CAME UP TO ME REAL COCKY
AND CONFIDENT.

561
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,202
I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

562
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,706
SO I'M THINKING HE'S ALWAYS
SAYING I'M MARINE, YOU KNOW,

563
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,667
THIS AND THAT, YOU KNOW, SO I
TOLD HIM, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING

564
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,501
AROUND SWEARING ON YOUR MARINE.

565
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,961
>> HE'S LIKE, I HAVE NEVER DONE
THAT.

566
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:19,007
MAYBE HE DIDN'T DIRECTLY SAY, "I
SWEAR ON MY MARINE," BUT IT

567
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,258
DOESN'T MATTER.

568
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,887
I KNOW I'M IN TROUBLE, SO I GOT
TO DO WHAT I CAN TO BLOW UP HIS

569
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,220
GAME.

570
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,514
>> LISTEN.

571
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,515
>> NO, YOU LISTEN.

572
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,350
>> WHY ARE YOU GETTING ALL
UPSET.

573
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:34,355
>> BECAUSE INSTEAD OF ASKING ME
ABOUT IT AND TALKING TO ME ABOUT

574
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,191
IT, YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE.

575
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,025
>> ARE THEY YELLING?

576
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,151
>> UH-HUH.

577
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,360
>> THEY HAVE A RIVALRY.

578
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,904
>> DON'T GET UPSET.

579
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,364
THERE'S NO REASON TO GET AMPED
UP, DUDE.

580
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,073
I THINK THAT'S YOUR GAME, AND
THAT'S COOL.

581
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,909
>> JOE PUSHED THE RIGHT BUTTON.

582
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:50,538
I TAKE WHAT I DID IN THE MARINE
CORPS VERY SERIOUS.

583
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,874
AND I'M STILL DEALING WITH WITH
IT.

584
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:58,213
THERE'S THINGS I HAVE TO LIVE
WITH EVERY DAY, AND THOUGHTS

585
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,175
THAT I HAVE EVERY SINGLE DAY,
AND FOR SOME PUTS LIKE HIM TO

586
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,054
SIT THERE AND TELL PEOPLE THAT I
SWORE ON IT, IT PISSES ME OFF.

587
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,515
I DIDN'T SWEAR ON THE MARINE
CORPS.

588
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,391
>> ALL RIGHT.

589
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,059
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T.

590
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,769
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

591
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,354
>> I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

592
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:18,233
>> I KNOW YOU DON'T, WHEN
SOMEONE SWEARS ON THE MARINES,

593
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,359
THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

594
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,860
>> YEAH, THEY'RE FIGHTING.

595
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,528
>> ARE THEY REALLY?

596
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,780
>> JOE IS JUST SITTING THERE.

597
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,073
BEN IS THE MORE DEMONSTRATIVE
ONE.

598
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,743
I DON'T KNOW.

599
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,245
JOE JUST CAUSING TROUBLE AT
CAMP.

600
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,412
IT'S CERTAINLY UNSETTLING.

601
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,083
I HOPE HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING,
BECAUSE I REALIZE THERE IS A

602
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,086
TARGET AT MY BACK, BUT JOE'S
INSTINCTS HAVE WORKED WELL UP TO

603
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,381
THIS POINT, SO THIS COULD EITHER
WORK OUT REALLY WELL FOR ME OR

604
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:47,262
REALLY BADLY FOR ME.

605
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,723
>> I FOUND A SECRET ADVANTAGE
OUT THERE.

606
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,184
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS, BECAUSE
THERE'S IN WAY WE'RE GOING TO BE

607
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,936
ABLE TO DO SPLIT VOTES NOW.

608
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,522
>> THERE'S NOT?

609
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,108
>> NOT WITH THE SECRET
ADVANTAGE?

610
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,111
I DECIDED TO TELL BEN ABOUT THE
SECRET ADVANTAGE, BECAUSE IF I

611
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:07,949
PLAY IT AND DON'T VOTE, THEN IT
WOULD BE THREE VOTES JOE, THREE

612
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,952
DESI, AND THE HEALERS COULD USE
THEIR FOUR VOTES TO VOTE OUT ONE

613
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:11,786
OF US.

614
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,329
>> WHAT DOES YOUR SECRET
ADVANTAGE SAY?

615
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:19,002
>> IF I USE IT TODAY, I CAN VOTE
TWICE.

616
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:23,256
I'M SOLID WITH BEN, HOWEVER, I'M
PLAYING THIS GAME FOR MYSELF AND

617
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,427
FOR MY DAUGHTER, AND HAVING THAT
EXTRA VOTE COULD GET ME TO THE

618
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,305
FINAL THREE, SO I'VE GOT TO MAKE
A BIG DECISION.

619
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,933
>> BUT THIS COULD CREATE A HUGE
PROBLEM FOR US.

620
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,311
IT'S A BLESSING AND A CURSE THAT
SHE FOUND IT.

621
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,147
BUT RIGHT NOW I'M WORRIED THAT
YES'S GOT ANOTHER IDOL, SO WE

622
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,275
HAVE TO SPLIT THE VOTE.

623
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,192
BUT GET THE NUMBERS.

624
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,821
I HAVE TO CONVINCE A HEALER TO
COME WITH US.

625
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,656
WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU ON BOARD
WITH THIS ONE.

626
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,783
>> I WANT JOE GONE.

627
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,162
I CAN'T STAND TO BE ON THIS
ISLAND WITH HIM ANY LONGER, BUT

628
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,331
IF YOU DON'T VOTE WITH US
TONIGHT, I'M GOING HOME.

629
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,999
>> WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU?

630
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,502
>> JOE, DESI, AND COLE.

631
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,379
>> BUT THAT'S ONLY THREE.

632
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,341
>> RIGHT, BUT IF SOMETHING
SCREWY HAPPENS, MY NAME IS DOWN.

633
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,135
>> FOR SOME REASON BEN FEELS HE
NEEDS ME TO VOTE OUT JOE.

634
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,346
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

635
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,516
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,
BUT IF I SHOW MY ALLEGIANCE TO

636
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,144
BEN, THIS COULD BE MY MOMENT TO
GET OFF THE BOTTOM.

637
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:22,565
AT AT THE SAME TIME, THIS COULD
BE A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE

638
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,359
OUT THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THIS
GAME.

639
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,318
AND THAT'S BEN.

640
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,904
>> I WORRY THAT THEY'RE JUST
LYING TO ME AGAIN.

641
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,947
I DON'T KNOW.

642
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,408
OBVIOUSLY IF JOE GOES HOME,
YOU'RE NEXT.

643
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,327
AND THEN AFTER YOU IS ME.

644
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,495
YOU KNOW?

645
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,206
>> IF THIS DON'T WORK, I MIGHT
BE SCREWED.

646
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,918
IT'S A GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE.

647
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,004
I'VE JUST PUT ONE ROUND IN THE
CHAMBER, SPUN IT, AND HOPEFULLY

648
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:54,055
THE HAMMER DOESN'T GO DOWN ON ME
TONIGHT.

649
00:32:54,138 --> 00:33:05,400
THE HAMMER DOESN'T GO DOWN ON ME
TONIGHT.

650
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,360
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO, JOE,
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL YOU PLAYED

651
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,446
OUT HOT, PLAYED AN IDOL,
SURVIVED THE VOTE.

652
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,573
IS IT FAIR THE SAY YOU MIGHT
FEEL SOME HEAT?

653
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,952
>> JEFF, TELL ME A TIME I'VE
BEEN AT TRIBAL WHEN I HAVEN'T

654
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:16,411
FELT THE HEAT.

655
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,787
HASN'T HAPPENED.

656
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,038
THIS TRIBAL IS NO DIFFERENT.

657
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,248
THERE'S ONE PERSON RUNNING THIS
GAME RIGHT NEW AND THAT'S BEN.

658
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,750
>> Jeff: BEN?

659
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,129
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, APPARENTLY I
AM A THREAT TO JOE, BUT OUR

660
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,257
ALLIANCE IS NOT A ONE-PERSON
ALLIANCE.

661
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,926
WE SIT LIKE THE KNIGHTS OF A
ROUNDTABLE.

662
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:34,554
THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE
HERE THAT WILL HAVE MY BACK,

663
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,264
JUST LIKE I HAVE THEIRS.

664
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,099
>> Jeff: COLE, DO YOU READ
ANYTHING INTO THE LAST VOTE IN

665
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,812
TERMS OF THE HEALERS BEING THE
TARGET, OR WAS JESSICA JUST ONE

666
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,106
VOTE AND TONIGHT COULD BE
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT?

667
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,357
>> THE HEALERS ARE ABSOLUTELY A
TARGET.

668
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:53,281
IT'S KIND OF SILLY FOR US TO BUY
INTO THE LIE OF THE PEOPLE THAT

669
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,073
FLIPPED.

670
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,409
>> Jeff: JOE, WHY ARE YOU
LAUGHING?

671
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,911
>> I CALLED IT SINCE DAY ONE.

672
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,748
REALLY, YOU'RE ALLOWING BEN OUT
OF ALL PEOPLE TO DISRUPT THIS?

673
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,625
WE HEALERS WE THOUGHT WE WERE
STRONG, BUT WE BECAME WEAKER

674
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,669
WHEN WE ALLOWED BEN TO CAUSE
CHAOS.

675
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,964
>> JEFF, THIS IS ALWAYS COMING
FROM A GUY WHO SAID I WAS

676
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,299
SWEARING ON THE MARINES.

677
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,301
I WOULD NEVER SWEAR ON THE
MARINES.

678
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:19,515
NO ONE KNOWS SACRIFICES THAT
MARINES MAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY,

679
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,642
AND SO I GOT A LITTLE HEATED
TODAY.

680
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,935
I'M APOLOGIZING RIGHT NOW.

681
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,646
JOE PUSHED MY BUTTON, LIKE HE
WAS PROBABLY TRYING TO DO.

682
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,107
>> I WASN'T TRYING TO PUSH YOUR
BUTTON.

683
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,567
>> LET ME FINISH, PLEASE.

684
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,819
>> I'M NOT PUSHING BUTTONS.

685
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,862
>> STOP TALKING.

686
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,322
NONE OF US WANT TO LISTEN TO YOU
ANYMORE.

687
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,324
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

688
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,784
>> Jeff: WOW.

689
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,120
ASHLEY, IT IS INTERESTING THAT
ONE GUY CAN GET SO MANY PEOPLE

690
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,330
EMOTIONAL.

691
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,165
>> IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY IF
JOE IS REALLY GOOD AT PLAYING

692
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,127
THIS GAME OR IF HE'S JUST REALLY
GOOD AT BEING VERY ANNOYLING

693
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:48,961
HONESTLY.

694
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:49,504
>> I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF
BOTH.

695
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,299
>> IT'S HARD TO TELL.

696
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,302
>> Jeff: DESI, IT'S
INTERESTING THAT JOE COULD

697
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,220
ULTIMATELY IMPACT YOU.

698
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,305
YOU WERE A HEALER IN THE
BEGINNING, AS WELL.

699
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,183
>> I THINK JOE HAS BEEN
CONSISTENT IN HIS GAME PLAY, AND

700
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:06,521
I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS PEOPLE
MANIPULATE WORDS TO MEAN WHAT

701
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,396
THEY WANT IT TO MEAN IN THAT
MOMENT.

702
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,233
IF YOU LOOK AT IT ONE WAY, IT'S
THE TRUTH.

703
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,360
IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE OTHER WAY,
IT'S A LIE.

704
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,738
>> Jeff: MIKE, THE GAME JUST
KEEPS RATCHETING UP.

705
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,200
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, I
DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THIS

706
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,371
CHANGES HOW PEOPLE ARE VOTING OR
NOT, BUT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T

707
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,455
TRUST PEOPLE.

708
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:29,585
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHAT
HAPPENED WITH OUR NEW YAWA

709
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,795
ALLIANCE?

710
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,881
YOUR FEELINGS GET HURT AND YOU
FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN BETRAY.

711
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,882
IT'S TOUGH.

712
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,094
>> Jeff: BEN, WHERE DO YOU
WEIGH IN ON THIS?

713
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,887
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH MUCH WORSE.

714
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,930
I'LL TRY TO FIND THE CLARITY.

715
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,391
>> JEFF, I'VE BEEN THROUGH A
LOT, LIKE ANY OTHER VET.

716
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,854
WE'VE HAD THE KEEP OUR HEADS
COOL AND PROBABLY THE MOST HIGH,

717
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,399
INTENSE, DANGEROUS SITUATIONS,
AND IT'S VERY EASY TO GET

718
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,483
OVERWHELMED.

719
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:57,697
AFTER GETTING OUT, I'VE GONE
THROUGH A LOT OF PERSONAL

720
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,739
GROWTH.

721
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,242
TO THIS DAY I'M STILL WORKING ON
THINGS LIKE ANGER.

722
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:05,288
THAT'S WHY I TRULY APOLOGIZE TO
JOE, NOT BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING

723
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,416
TO GET ME ANGRY, BUT BECAUSE I
LET HIM GET ME THAT ANGRY.

724
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,252
>> Jeff: DESI, "SURVIVOR" CAN
BRING OUT THE WORST IN YOU, OR

725
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,630
YOU CAN SAY "SURVIVOR"
CHALLENGES YOU.

726
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,424
IT GIVES YOU THE CHANCE TO FIGHT
TO BE YOUR BEST.

727
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:21,470
>> THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT,
BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT PEOPLE

728
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:25,099
WOULD SAY THAT LYING IS NOT A
PART OF THE BEST VERSION OF

729
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:27,393
THEMSELVES, AND I ALSO THINK
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

730
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,313
SITTING HERE WHO TO SOME DEGREE
IN THIS GAME HAVE TOLD AT LEAST

731
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,940
ONE IF NOT SEVERAL LIES.

732
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,484
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHERE YOU
DRAW YOUR MORAL LINE.

733
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,196
>> DREW: WHICH SPEAKS TO SOME
LEVEL OF CHARACTER THAT YOU GUYS

734
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,201
ARE ALL AWARE OF, BUT YOU'RE
FIGHTING THIS DILEMMA.

735
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,619
DEVON, WHERE DO YOU WEIGH IN ON
THIS?

736
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:49,665
>> I THINK THIS GAME JUST STRIPS
US DOWN.

737
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,958
WE REALLY ARE EXPOSED.

738
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,460
TODAY AT CAMP WE GOT BACK FROM
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

739
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,338
I WAS JUST LAYING IN THE SHELTER
LIKE BEN, JUST BOOM.

740
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,589
I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THAT.

741
00:36:56,672 --> 00:37:02,803
I FEEL LIKE I'M ALWAYS POSITIVE,
HIGH ENERGY PERSON, LOVING TO

742
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,306
SMILE AND LAUGH AND JUST HAVE A
GOOD TIME ALL THE TIME.

743
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,141
I DON'T WANT TO BE A ZOMBIE.

744
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,936
I LIKE BEING A BRIGHT AND
BEAUTIFUL LIGHT.

745
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,979
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT NOW.

746
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,356
>> Jeff: I THINK YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

747
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:13,898
ABOUT.

748
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,108
>> YOU GOT IT, DEVON.

749
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,778
>> Jeff: FASCINATING.

750
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,946
STARTED TRIBAL ATTACK.

751
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,449
THEN IT WENT DEEPER AND IT GOT
PERSONAL, AND YET ONCE AGAIN

752
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:28,496
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE THING WE
DO, IS VOTE, AND IT WILL ALL

753
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,457
CRYSTALLIZE AGAIN.

754
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,293
THAT WAS AN AMAZING JOURNEY.

755
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,002
[LAUGHTER]
WOW.

756
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,296
>> ROLLER COASTER, YOU COULD
SAY.

757
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,172
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

758
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:38,589
TIME TO VOTE.

759
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,426
J.P., YOU'RE UP.

760
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:45,614
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

761
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,825
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

762
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,579
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

763
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,580
OKAY.

764
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,041
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

765
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,584
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

766
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,753
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

767
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,757
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

768
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,094
FIRST VOTE BEN.

769
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,931
LAUREN.

770
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,769
DESI.

771
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,936
JOE.

772
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,565
THAT'S ONE VOTE BEN, ONE VOTE
LAUREN, ONE VOTE DESI, ONE VET

773
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,901
JOE.

774
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:22,318

00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,779
TWO VOTES DESI.

776

TWO VOTES JOE.

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,914
THAT'S THREE VOTES DESI.

780
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:35,373
JOE.

781
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,290
WE'RE TIED AGAIN.

782
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:41,337
THREE VOTES DESI, THREE VOTES
JOE.

783
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,921
DESI.

784
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,422
THAT'S FOUR VOTES DESI.

785
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,258
THREE VOTES JOE, ONE VOTE BEN,
ONE VOTE LAUREN.

786
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:53,015
ONE VOTE LEFT.

787
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:53,891
JOE.

788
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,767
WE'RE TIED.

789
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,645
THAT'S FOUR VOTES JOE, FOUR
VOTES DESI.

790
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,105
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.

791
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,817
WE'RE GOING TO REVOTE, DESI AND
JOE, YOU WILL NOT VOTE.

792
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,944
EVERYBODY ELSE HERE, YOU CAN
ONLY VOTE FOR DESI OR JOE.

793
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,030
J.P., DO YOU WANT THE COME GRAB
THE URN?

794
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:48,195
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

795
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,740
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

796
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:56,203
FIRST VOTE DESI.

797
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,037

00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,667
ONE VOTE DOES, ONE VOTE JOE.

799
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,209
DESI.

800
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,629
THAT'S TWO VOTES DESI.

801
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,213
DESI.

802
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,381
THREE VOTES DESI.

803
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,675
ONE VOTE JOE.

804

THAT'S FOUR VOTES DESI.

806
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,559
EIGHTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY, DESI.

807
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:32,740
THAT'S FIVE, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

808
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:37,411
DESI, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

809
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,038
>> GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.

810
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:39,747
>> BYE, DESI.

811
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:47,046
>> BYE, DES.

812
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,590
>> Jeff: WELL, IF ROLLER
COASTER IS THE THEME FOR THE

813
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,718
NIGHT, WE ARE STILL EARLY IN THE
RIDE, WHICH MEANS THERE ARE

814
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,554
STILL A LOT MORE LOOPS TO COME.

815
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,764
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

816
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,100

"SURVIVOR," LAUREN'S ARMED AND

00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,745
DANGEROUS.

GOOD.

GAME HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED.

OR PLANNED.

IT'S TRULY HEARTBREAKING.

I'M IN THE USED TO LOSING.

833
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:45,604
IT'S IN THE PART OF WHAT I
TYPICALLY DO, BUT IN THIS GAME I

834
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,524
WASN'T PART OF ANYBODY'S PLAN
MOVING FORWARD, SO I HAVE THE

835

REALIZE THAT'S PART OF THE GAME
AND SOMEBODY HAS THE GO HOME.

I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE TO SAY.
