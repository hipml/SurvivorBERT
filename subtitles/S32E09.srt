2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,836
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:07,436
Muscles and Beauty 
formed the dominant alliance

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,273
and aimed at Intelligence.

5
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:11,911
It is more or less established 
that the Intelligences will leave.

6
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:14,856
But Cydney was fed up 
with men controlling the game.

7
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,850
Don't watch me, 
you're not my father!

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,718
Pissed off Cydney will blow it all up!

9
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:22,282
So she rallied the women 
to get a man out.

10
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,391
Are you up 
for voting Nick tonight?

11
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,226
If it sucks, well,

12
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:28,351
I will be the first to react.

13
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:32,240
On the advice...

14
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,968
We also heard about 
a super-idol.

15
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,879
...Tai made a big mistake.

16
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,115
I thought everyone knew.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,118
But for Cydney, 
everything went according to plan .

18
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,325
when the women 
sent Nick to the jury...

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,813
Nick, the tribe has spoken.

20
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,483
...Scot, Jason and Tai reuniting

21
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:53,161
to wonder what to do, 
at the bottom of the scale.

22
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:54,763
There are nine left.

23
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,922
Who will be eliminated tonight?

24
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:09,468
Good game ! 
Girl power, huh?

25
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:10,804
Nice shot, girls.

26
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,683
The girls did a great job

27
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:16,130
and took us by surprise.

28
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,766
The Muscles alliance 
is clearly over.

29
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:21,356
Now it's Jason and me. 
And Tai.

30
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:23,516
Are the girls together?

31
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:27,084
- It's clear. 
- With Joe.

32
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,132
At the council, I said, 
"Jeff, there's a super-idol.", and...

33
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,802
Oh no ! 
I have spoken too much again!

34
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,302
So, who did you vote for?

35
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:39,608
So I freaked out 
and voted for Jason,

36
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:42,844
but I dreaded 
having to explain this vote.

37
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:45,270
Because I don't lie very well.

38
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,382
So I said, "I voted Debbie."

39
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,709
We should have saved Nick tonight.

40
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,443
Yeah, but we can still use it. 
They don't know I have it.

41
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:54,356
- So you really have one? 
- Yes.

42
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,173
I have one. 
You have one.

43
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:57,650
The super-idol is real.

44
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:59,893
On the next board, 
when they try something,

45
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,940
we'll be like, 
"Guess what, bunch of bitches!"

46
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:05,901
We are only three, 
but we have two idols.

47
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:09,104
And together, 
they form a super-idol.

48
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,683
How about 
taking their food?

49
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,468
We don't give them anything?

50
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,492
After bedtime, 
the machete and ax disappear.

51
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,004
Yeah. Far far away.

52
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,142
Very far.

53
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,086
We'll take 
the machete and the ax,

54
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,313
take away their ability 
to do things,

55
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,624
just to demoralize them a bit. 
It's psychological warfare.

56
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:33,219
I did it in the military 
and as a bounty hunter.

57
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,230
We cut their relations,

58
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,758
we confuse their heads,

59
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:39,679
we maintain their weakness, 
we look for the fault, their weaknesses,

60
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:41,895
we read between the lines 
and we try to hit.

61
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,763
I love psychological warfare.

62
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:47,000
We make life in the camp miserable, 
we don't bring anything to eat.

63
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:49,002
Do we agree on that?

64
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,838
It's a game, 
I have to follow the strategy.

65
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,165
But the 
Jason and Scot way

66
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,285
is really extreme.

67
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,747
When we talk about taking food and equipment away from the girls ,

68
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,898
this makes me uneasy.

69
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:07,829
It's not my approach to life 
or problem solving.

70
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,010
I'm not proud of it

71
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:12,092
but I cannot 
control their actions.

72
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:13,823
It's time to sow chaos.

73
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:31,476
Hello, Joe.

74
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:40,380
- Tai is up? 
- Nope.

75
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:43,923
I've been lighting the fire for two days .

76
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,866
Sabotage 
is above all to weaken them.

77
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:50,899
'Cause it might 
freak someone out

78
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,723
and I hope 
that will change things.

79
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,260
I found the machete.

80
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,872
- Where is she ? 
- Just there.

81
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,283
It's time I tried 
to ruin everyone else's life.

82
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,644
Let's put that somewhere.

83
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:25,839
It's a good path.

84
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,609
We took the machete and the ax,

85
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,751
we went a little deeper 
into the jungle...

86
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:32,539
It's a needle in a 
haystack, how would they know?

87
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:34,564
...and we hid the tools.

88
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:36,471
They will never find them.

89
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:40,355
I'm not going to lie down and say, 
"Hey, well done!"

90
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:44,193
All we can do 
is fight, and that's what we will do.

91
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:47,353
And if that means 
ruining the lives of others along the way,

92
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:48,722
that's what I will do.

93
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,399
Jason, will you...?

94
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,336
If you want, I pour.

95
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,274
The advice was wonderful.

96
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,084
People who thought they 
had total control

97
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,078
discovered 
that it was an illusion.

98
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:46,422
It's good.

99
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,208
And now they are angry.

100
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,984
So the atmosphere is unpleasant.

101
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:53,319
- You want some ? 
- Yeah.

102
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,787
It shows their character

103
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:00,117
the bad losers that they are.

104
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:01,795
They are not gentlemen.

105
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:04,247
Do you know where the machete is?

106
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:06,474
She was there.

107
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,877
You opened cocos 
last night.

108
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,604
And the axe?

109
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,441
Ax and machete, missing.

110
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:15,442
- No machete? 
- No axe.

111
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:16,816
Where have they gone?

112
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,647
This morning, upon awakening,

113
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:20,622
one of the girls,

114
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,047
Michele, I believe, 
was looking for the machete and the ax...

115
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,318
Disappeared.

116
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:27,592
Could it be sabotage?

117
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:30,007
I think that's 
the right term, sir.

118
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:32,014
I believe that's it.

119
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,678
Muscles took them. 
It's ridiculous.

120
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:37,239
We don't hide tools

121
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,232
essential for the whole tribe.

122
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,076
It's really immature.

123
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,738
We'll find a way to eat 
without a machete or an ax.

124
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,119
We fuck them.

125
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,809
The boys 
think they can break us

126
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:51,478
by doing that,

127
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:54,147
but we'll use our brains 
to find another way.

128
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:56,383
We're going to grill them, 
like we used to.

129
00:06:57,258 --> 00:06:58,693
Oh ! Missed !

130
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,018
It's going to work.

131
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:03,472
No big guys needed. 
We'll find a way.

132
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,074
We do with what we have.

133
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,100
In 20 minutes,

134
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:08,795
we found a new way.

135
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:18,405
Wow, it opens!

136
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:22,017
You won't stop us!

137
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:25,761
Attractive ! It suddenly opened!

138
00:07:25,886 --> 00:07:28,035
It's fun, actually. 
I quite like this method.

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,182
I listen to their: 
"Everything is fine! We're in control!

140
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,695
We'll heat the coconuts, 
like before!

141
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,106
Everything will be alright !"

142
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,365
And... I was already upset.

143
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:39,728
Attractive !

144
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:43,872
But that was the last straw. 
Alright, are you showing off again?

145
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,467
Now I'm drunk, 
and I'm going to do something stupid.

146
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,235
It wasn't that long.

147
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:54,407
Let's end the speculation.

148
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:04,451
Why do you do that ?

149
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,631
- Why are you sabotaging us? 
- Why did you sabotage us?

150
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,353
- What ? That's the game. 
- Exactly.

151
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,060
Pour water on the fire?

152
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,438
- Come on, that's petty. 
- It's part of the game.

153
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,107
You are the fire starter. 
Light a fire.

154
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,599
I am speechless.

155
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:22,535
You show your true face.

156
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:26,972
I do not tolerate this kind 
of behavior in my normal life.

157
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:29,504
I won't tolerate it here either.

158
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:31,419
Good. Let's turn it back on.

159
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,422
They can 
fuel the power struggle,

160
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,982
but we will not back down.

161
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:38,063
We will always find a way.

162
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:39,419
Let's go.

163
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,147
Well done, my dear.

164
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,601
They turned it back on. 
I knew they would get there.

165
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:46,377
Not serious. We'll turn it back on.

166
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:48,828
But we have to make life difficult for them.

167
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,464
Can't be too extreme.

168
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,967
- Why not ? 
- They'll fire us anyway.

169
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:56,889
It will be hard for me to watch.

170
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,575
But I have to take a step back.

171
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,917
Picking on us last night 
didn't bother them.

172
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,043
Exactly.

173
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:06,246
Let's find another 
fun thing to do.

174
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,935
Over here, everyone!

175
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,592
At the last tip,

176
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:35,675
it was clearly 
a surprise elimination.

177
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,828
Did it have an impact 
on the camp?

178
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,875
Or does 
the game just continue?

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,356
I feel 
like the cold war is over

180
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,400
and the missiles are going 
all over the place, frankly.

181
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,021
- In other words ? 
- There is sabotage on the camp.

182
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,932
When I woke up, 
the hatchet was gone,

183
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:52,601
machete,

184
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,029
and Scot poured 
20 liters of water on our fire

185
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:57,572
to turn it off.

186
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,502
Scot, what is the reasoning 
behind this action?

187
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:02,711
I just sent a message:

188
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,571
it is I who will fetch the water.

189
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,748
There are mangoes on the camp,

190
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,221
because I help Tai to climb 
the tree and he picks them.

191
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:10,948
I can climb that damn tree!

192
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,480
Good luck. 
We'll see.

193
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:16,282
It's clearly animated. 
It should be interesting.

194
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,743
- Ready for the reward test? 
- Yes.

195
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:22,122
Good. Today,

196
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,833
you will be divided 
into two teams of four.

197
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,172
Each team 
will be tied to a long rope.

198
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:29,329
At my signal,

199
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:32,543
you will work together to distress her.

200
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:34,705
When she 
's completely unwound,

201
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,547
you will detach 
and use sandbags

202
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,408
to knock blocks off 
their support.

203
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:45,620
The first team 
to free support from any block

204
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,964
win the reward. 
Want to know what's at stake?

205
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:50,684
It's something 
you could do,

206
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:51,885
on a Friday night,

207
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,053
your house.

208
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:55,964
Chinese meals to take away, 
delivered to the camp.

209
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,258
- Oh my God ! 
- So, I have a question.

210
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,769
We were going to form the teams 
like a schoolyard.

211
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,638
But if you can 
agree,

212
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,865
do it now, 
otherwise we'll draw lots.

213
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,915
But be careful: 
one person will be excluded.

214
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:11,613
This person may choose 
to support a team.

215
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:15,542
If she chooses well, 
she will enjoy the reward.

216
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,077
I do not participate.

217
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:18,820
You are not participating.

218
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,648
Well, that simplifies things. 
Now there are eight people.

219
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:23,644
Do we have two quartets?

220
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:26,387
There is animosity, let 
it be expressed!

221
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:29,107
Any of the girls 
want to join us?

222
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:33,001
We have Tai, Jason and Scot 
looking for a girl.

223
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,363
I will go.

224
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:40,675
Julia rushes in front 
and says she will go with the guys,

225
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,301
fast enough.

226
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,824
I thought, "Wait, 
what's really going on?"

227
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:48,416
I decided to go with the boys,

228
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,945
because at this point 
I know that attracting Scot and Jason

229
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,298
can be of great benefit to me.

230
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,550
It's time for me 
to start acting and playing my game.

231
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,495
Julia joins Tai, Jason and Scot.

232
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,888
Which leaves Michele,

233
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,202
Joe chose not to participate. 
Which team will you support?

234
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,458
Girls.

235
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,897
- Joe chooses the girls. Easy. 
- It's good.

236
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,372
Good. 
Take a seat, let's get started.

237
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,612
Good.

238
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,812
Let's go. 
For the reward.

239
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,550
Survivors, ready?

240
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,111
Michele, below. 
I pass over it.

241
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:29,649
No better test 
for a group that does not get along.

242
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:32,301
Below? Above !

243
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,920
Lots of rope to distress.

244
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:36,944
The better you communicate, 
the sooner you will be free

245
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,159
and can start 
throwing your sandbags.

246
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:40,748
And I go over it.

247
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:43,830
- The women are doing well. 
- Go girls !

248
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,572
Jason and Tai are tangled.

249
00:12:47,697 --> 00:12:49,925
If you get tangled up, you'll fall 
behind quickly.

250
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,205
I can't go under. 
It makes knots.

251
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,734
Julia, go over the two.

252
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,080
The Yellows are accelerating.

253
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:57,255
I passed.

254
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,379
Julia chose 
to join the men.

255
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,338
So far it works.

256
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:03,592
Women slow down.

257
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:07,188
Aubry, Michele, Cydney, Debbie 
are all tangled up.

258
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,932
Scot, Jason, Tai and Julia 
are very close to the goal.

259
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:12,726
- Below. 
- Yeah, that's it.

260
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:15,471
Now you have to turn around 
to free yourself

261
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,539
and bring back 
the four separate strings.

262
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,033
I'm free.

263
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:21,498
The women are detached.

264
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:23,903
They try to turn 
and release the rope.

265
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,238
Julia is free.

266
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,308
Its good ! Free yourself ! 
Start throwing your bags!

267
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,050
Tai, Scott, Jason and Julia.

268
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:34,723
You have to knock down 
all these blocks from the support.

269
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,217
Aubry, the last woman, 
has to go around.

270
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:40,528
There should be no more rope 
on top of the log.

271
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,364
Good !

272
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,057
Jason hits the mark again.

273
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:46,869
Come on, girl!

274
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,728
The women are done! 
Detach yourself!

275
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,634
Women need to step up.

276
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,567
Jason continues to shoot.

277
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:59,172
It will take more than that to get back up.

278
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,050
Jason is exhausted. 
Here is Scott.

279
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,740
He throws with force.

280
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,476
Very big blow for Scot.

281
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:06,813
Who knows how to throw hard?

282
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,183
Cydney misses again. 
This is Debbie.

283
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:15,855
Debbie takes down two more.

284
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,687
Debbie takes down three more.

285
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:22,095
Debbie drops another one.

286
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,606
The women are coming back!

287
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:26,833
Debbie has one hell of an arm.

288
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,437
Debbie takes down two more.

289
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:33,014
Scot tries his hand at delicacy.

290
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,509
You need to release the media. 
All those blocks still count.

291
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:39,446
Scot shoots down another.

292
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,591
Again a hotly contested race.

293
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,550
Debbie shoots two.

294
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:46,386
Debbie drops another one.

295
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,068
It's very tight.

296
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:50,857
Scot shoots down another. 
More than three for the men.

297
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,861
More than two for men.

298
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:56,863
There are six left for the women.

299
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,366
Five for women.

300
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:03,087
More than one for Jason.

301
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,614
One more hit for Jason 
and it's over.

302
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,349
Like in baseball!

303
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,878
And There you go !

304
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:15,023
Jason, Scott, Tai and Julia

305
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,516
win the reward!

306
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,701
Huge effort.

307
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,135
Huge effort.

308
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,405
Neck and neck again, 
with teams chosen by you.

309
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,986
Jason, Scot, Thailand, Julia,

310
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,143
a great reward 
awaits you on the camp.

311
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,062
Take-out Chinese 
will be delivered to you.

312
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,781
Pack your things, 
head back to camp, enjoy!

313
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,717
Cydney, Michele, Aubry, Joe, Debbie. 
I have nothing for you.

314
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,678
Take your things, 
return to camp.

315
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:48,751
Julia and the boys 
won the award.

316
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:51,184
And as soon as I saw her 
go with the boys,

317
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,287
I knew she was trying 
to improve her position.

318
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,331
She plays both ways.

319
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,258
But I see clearly in his game.

320
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:00,560
I can't 
trust him at all.

321
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:17,544
Noble effort. 
I am happy for you.

322
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:18,670
Enjoy.

323
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,224
Tai, you're going to have your noodles!

324
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:22,957
I'm happy for you.

325
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,914
In today's race, we won.

326
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,667
Everything changes in the blink of an eye.

327
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,621
That's what makes this game 
so wonderful.

328
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:31,633
- You're going to have your noodles, Tai! 
- Yeah, you're going to have your noodles.

329
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,693
We are again 
on the upward slope.

330
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:37,435
We're not at the top, 
but Julia has restarted the machine.

331
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,665
We have a chance.

332
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:41,401
Ah, noodles!

333
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:44,138
- Good job guys ! 
- Owl !

334
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:48,493
Julia, Tai, Jason, me 
and Marc the chicken,

335
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:50,595
we ate Chinese 
and drank a few beers.

336
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,112
Everything was spot on.

337
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:54,147
Oh, horoscope cookies!

338
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:55,564
But the best in it,

339
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:58,551
it's having the opportunity to speak 
with Julia, to see what she thinks.

340
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:00,120
If you had the choice,

341
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:01,451
what would you do ?

342
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,989
And don't worry 
if you see it without us, I get it.

343
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:06,778
No, I see that with you, 
for now.

344
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:11,473
Eliminating you 
would be stupid of me.

345
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,633
Because then I would be at the end

346
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:17,459
from the chain 
of Cydney, Joe, Debbie and Aubry.

347
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:20,682
At this stage, 
you have to think long term.

348
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:23,118
I have my other allies,

349
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,458
in whom I trust,

350
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,804
but to take people 
like Scot and Jason to the end,

351
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,457
who betrayed people, 
wreaked havoc on the camp,

352
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,008
might be a good idea.

353
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,118
Because at this point, 
no juror would vote for them.

354
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:36,523
You should do 
what's best for you.

355
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:39,061
Whatever you do, please 
communicate with us.

356
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:40,886
I will, from now on.

357
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,101
It's easier to be a villain.

358
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:51,613
When there are only five of us left, 
it will be exceptional.

359
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:53,975
Here they are.

360
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,194
Who is that ?

361
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,496
Behind us.

362
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:57,773
Are they already finished?

363
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:01,770
She went to the dark side.

364
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:04,984
You know, she's very smart. 
She plays with them.

365
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:06,294
On will come.

366
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,631
Some think that Julia 
has it both ways,

367
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,296
but i have no 
worries

368
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:14,269
as to a betrayal by Julia.

369
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,895
They tried to lure you out?

370
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:17,579
A little.

371
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,396
No chance. 
No chance.

372
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:23,144
Tomorrow, I hope it's Scot.

373
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,545
I don't believe Jason 
is the mastermind. It's Scotus.

374
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,719
Is that where we split the votes?

375
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:29,743
We'll see who wins and we'll discuss.

376
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,666
- OK. 
- OK ?

377
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,851
My canard radar was doing this 
when Julia was talking to Miss Debbie.

378
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,896
You find it strategic 
to come from this group

379
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,505
and start by asking:

380
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,366
"What strategy for the next 
board?" I do not trust.

381
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:44,733
She thinks she's clever, 
but it doesn't work with me.

382
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,659
I see it coming 
as big as a house.

383
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:49,704
What I think... 
Give me your opinion.

384
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:54,501
- Exactly. 
- That's what I think.

385
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,901
- It's the most dangerous. 
- She goes back and forth.

386
00:18:58,026 --> 00:18:59,706
Exactly. She makes sense

387
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,014
and socially intelligent.

388
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:05,315
Julia doesn't want wedding rings.

389
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:09,149
She wants to stay in the center 
until the end.

390
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,110
She plays both ways.

391
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,129
But sometimes the person in the middle 
of the road gets knocked down.

392
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:16,081
And I hope it will be her.

393
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:36,151
I woke up 
in the middle of the night.

394
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,911
I thought, "You know what?

395
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:39,585
I am engaged with the boys.

396
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,991
I was upset 
when Scot put out the big fire.

397
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:44,509
My heart feels it.

398
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:47,090
But I have to take a step back

399
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:50,466
compared to my sympathy.

400
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:51,891
I like them,

401
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:55,797
but if it's war, we have to 
complicate the life of the other side.

402
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,668
So I decided to put out the fire.

403
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:06,365
For now, it's them or us.

404
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,574
my evil side

405
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:09,843
rarely emerges, but it does happen.

406
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,021
What is the situation ?

407
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:23,598
- Dead. 
- Completely off?

408
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:25,758
Yes, completely.

409
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,328
Maybe 
we poured water on it again.

410
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:35,035
- Any embers left? 
- No, it's dead.

411
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,463
This sabotage 
is partly childishness.

412
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:41,372
But today, Scot and Jason 
knew what they were doing.

413
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,151
It was to mislead us, 
to vote for them,

414
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:47,981
because they probably have idols.

415
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,825
My instinct tells me,

416
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,695
flashing furiously, 
that Julia must go.

417
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:58,124
Scot really pissed me off 
with the fire today.

418
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:01,659
Now 
it compromises our diet.

419
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:03,489
And our survival.

420
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,284
I want him to go.

421
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,642
- OK. Do you want my opinion ? 
- Sure.

422
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,281
Scot didn't do it out of anger, 
that's for sure.

423
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:13,569
He's smart, it was deliberate.

424
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:17,977
He tries to agitate us 
so that we target him and Jason.

425
00:21:18,804 --> 00:21:20,819
I really think, Deb,

426
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:24,507
that we would blow up all the idols 
by voting Julia.

427
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:25,919
OK. That's the thing.

428
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:27,994
We have to fire all the guys first.

429
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,322
It kills me

430
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:32,908
let Debbie follow her emotions.

431
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:36,605
Scot poured this water on the fire 
to provoke a reaction.

432
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,765
I want to say to Debbie:

433
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,691
"You are getting emotional.

434
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,736
But right now, 
you have to be logical."

435
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:45,947
My instinct, 
and I respect your instinct,

436
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,641
tells me Scot or Jason has to go.

437
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:51,555
But I ask you 
if it's less risky

438
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,352
- and it would blow up the idols... 
- I won't vote for Julia.

439
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,082
- I will not do it. 
- OK.

440
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:57,733
Debbie doesn't budge.

441
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,804
I followed her 
on many things,

442
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:02,497
but I firmly believe

443
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:04,666
that Julia has to leave.

444
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,979
Over here, everyone!

445
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,824
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

446
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:34,162
First, Tai, 
I'm taking the necklace back.

447
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:41,920
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

448
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:43,096
Today,

449
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:46,090
you will place 
a series of blocks on a rail

450
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:49,594
avoiding tripping 
over the obstacle.

451
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,395
If you hit the obstacle,

452
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,025
your blocks will fall 
and you will have to replace them.

453
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,127
The goal: to place the blocks

454
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,053
so that they fall 
like dominoes

455
00:22:58,178 --> 00:22:59,946
and hit 
a gong at the end.

456
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,793
The first person 
to strike the gong wins immunity,

457
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:06,761
is sheltered from the council,

458
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,064
one in eight chance

459
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:10,799
to win this game.

460
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:13,280
The losers: on the council, 
someone will be eliminated

461
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:15,503
and will become 
the third member of the jury.

462
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:17,931
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

463
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:27,346
Well, on and go.

464
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:28,975
For immunity.

465
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,344
Survivors, ready?

466
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,178
One block at a time

467
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:38,685
and you must have 
both feet inside

468
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,795
before placing the first.

469
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:44,432
It is speed or accuracy.

470
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,427
The faster you go, 
the more risk you take.

471
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,407
You have to space them out so that they fall 
like dominoes.

472
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:54,609
Not too close

473
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,237
nor too far.

474
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:57,768
Just the right distance.

475
00:23:58,643 --> 00:24:00,849
Tai loses coins, 
he has to go again.

476
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:03,151
As soon as a block falls,

477
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,655
you must start again 
and then return to the obstacle.

478
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:09,321
Michele took the lead.

479
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:11,166
Jason is right behind her.

480
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,719
Aubry is in on it.

481
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:14,621
Scot tries to keep up.

482
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:17,457
Joe and Cydney are losing ground.

483
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,035
Julia, slowly but surely.

484
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:24,940
Jason loses everything.

485
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:26,708
First total disaster.

486
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,201
Jason does it again.

487
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,399
Scott loses everything...

488
00:24:33,524 --> 00:24:34,692
It's okay, Michele!

489
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:38,726
...giving Michele 
a great chance to win.

490
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,294
Tai goes back to Michelle.

491
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:43,028
It all depends on Tai.

492
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:44,884
Can he catch Michele?

493
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,156
Tai loses everything. 
He is no longer in the game.

494
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,513
It's between Michele, Debbie and Aubry.

495
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:54,908
- As long as it's you or me! 
- It's very tight.

496
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:58,498
Julia progressed slowly 
but surely throughout.

497
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,166
To have a chance,

498
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,523
she is going to have to work harder 
or hope for a mistake from Michele.

499
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,480
Aubry runs.

500
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:08,894
Aubry takes a big hit 
and loses it all.

501
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:10,838
It's between Michele,

502
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:13,338
and Julia.

503
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,819
Cydney loses everything. 
She's out of it.

504
00:25:20,112 --> 00:25:23,498
Michele returns 
with potentially her last block.

505
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:27,395
Only Julia and Debbie 
have a chance of catching her.

506
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:29,781
This may be the end.

507
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,679
Is the spacing good?

508
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:34,067
It's good, my daughter!

509
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:37,170
Here we go, for victory!

510
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:41,815
So far so good.

511
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,120
But no ! Michele fails!

512
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:47,956
Michele has to replace almost everything!

513
00:25:48,206 --> 00:25:50,630
It gives 
Debbie and Julia an opportunity.

514
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,907
And Julia loses blocks.

515
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,056
- Debbie can win. 
- Come on, Debbie!

516
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,134
She can win with this block.

517
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,369
Jason does not wait to be fixed.

518
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:04,014
He is still working, block by block.

519
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,765
Debbie is going to give it a shot.

520
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,100
For victory.

521
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:09,544
Let's go.

522
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:15,684
Debbie fails!

523
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,894
She will have to replace the blocks. 
New opportunity!

524
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,078
It is now Julia who tries 
to place her missing blocks.

525
00:26:22,345 --> 00:26:25,060
And suddenly, Scot and Jason 
are in on it again.

526
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:26,475
Without warning.

527
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,993
Jason had lost everything...

528
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:30,332
- I have to space them out. 
- ...earlier in the test,

529
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:31,744
but he did not give up.

530
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:33,982
He kept fighting 
and he's in on it.

531
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:35,900
Julia hurries 
to replace her blocks.

532
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:37,430
She still has her chances.

533
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:41,810
Scot reverses everything again.

534
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:46,593
Jason takes the time 
to put everything back from the end

535
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:48,650
to reduce the distance,

536
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:52,377
but he gives Julia a chance to 
come back, it's risky.

537
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:55,478
But he is decided. 
Julia places another block.

538
00:26:55,603 --> 00:26:57,592
He only seems to be missing one.

539
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,517
It will be played on the wire.

540
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,731
Debbie replaces her blocks, 
she doesn't give up.

541
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:05,967
Jason replaced everything. 
Will it work?

542
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:07,474
It was swollen.

543
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,299
Jason, for the win.

544
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,035
Jason fails! 
New opportunity!

545
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,658
Julia places her last block.

546
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,916
Michele goes back up, 
only missing a few blocks.

547
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,473
I'm done, Jeff!

548
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:25,042
Debbie, without warning, has finished.

549
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:26,854
Debbie gives it a shot.

550
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,957
No, Debbie fails!

551
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,383
Julia, for the win.

552
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,133
And she succeeds!

553
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:40,958
Julia wins individual immunity!

554
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,642
Well done Julia! 
It was awesome.

555
00:27:55,576 --> 00:27:56,710
Julia, come here.

556
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:04,408
The youngest in this game, 
and still going strong.

557
00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:08,663
A one in eight chance 
of winning this game.

558
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:12,425
As for you, after 24 days,

559
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,612
someone will be eliminated tonight 
and become the 3rd juror.

560
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:18,765
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council. Congratulation.

561
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,040
Thanks, Jeff.

562
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:22,851
The worst has happened. 
Julia won.

563
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:26,815
And the plan I believed in 
fell apart.

564
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:28,502
Just collapsed.

565
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:31,226
What to do now ?

566
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,541
The trick 
was to use them all.

567
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:02,709
- You used them all. Good game. 
- I was missing one.

568
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,486
Alright, I know we're gonna talk fast.

569
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,828
I just want to suggest this 
while we're all here.

570
00:29:08,953 --> 00:29:10,711
- [???] 
- Alright.

571
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:15,897
I say we split the votes 
between Tai and Scot.

572
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:18,058
Jason will expect 
it to be him.

573
00:29:18,183 --> 00:29:20,734
No chance 
that the three have an idol.

574
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:23,147
If it's 3 - 3 - 3,

575
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:25,470
we vote again for Scot.

576
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:27,175
Oh no.

577
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:29,544
Deb says, "Here's the plan."

578
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,244
Right in front of Julia.

579
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:33,848
And that really scares me.

580
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,879
For this to go well, 
we all have to agree.

581
00:29:37,463 --> 00:29:40,647
Aubry, you, Joe and I are voting Scot.

582
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,266
They will vote Tai.

583
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:43,550
In this scenario,

584
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:45,719
the vote would be three for Scot,

585
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:47,387
three for Tai and three...

586
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:50,425
...decided by the boys.

587
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,751
I will look for Tai.

588
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:53,740
Let him take care of his damn bird.

589
00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:57,272
But Julia played 
the double agent pretty well,

590
00:29:57,397 --> 00:30:00,508
and if only one person deviates, 
everything explodes,

591
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,203
and a person 
you wanted to keep leaves.

592
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:07,039
Want to know the plan?

593
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:08,293
What's this ?

594
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:10,785
They split the votes 
between you and Tai.

595
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,528
So, vote Cydney and it's over.

596
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:15,786
OK.

597
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:18,238
If Julia decides 
to be our little guardian angel,

598
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:20,394
and 
hopefully she votes for Cydney,

599
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,764
it will be 4 - 2 - 3.

600
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,969
But if Julia 
decides to follow her group,

601
00:30:28,219 --> 00:30:31,111
we pull out all the stops, 
we say we have idols,

602
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:33,133
we'll do whatever we can imagine

603
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:35,008
to make sure you stay.

604
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,603
We have no other option.

605
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,501
Good then...

606
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:42,909
But why is Miss Debbie 
sharing the info like that?!

607
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:45,178
Don't say anything to Julia!

608
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:48,196
To believe that she wants 
to screw everything up.

609
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:53,762
she worries me a lot.

610
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:56,162
Debbie is deaf to all logic.

611
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,833
She fully trusts 
Julia.

612
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,969
And so far in Survivor,

613
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:03,775
i need a logical person

614
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:07,167
and which I know 
will not deviate.

615
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:11,388
Should I give up on Debbie, 
is that what you think?

616
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:12,814
And you know what ?

617
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:14,555
I am not against.

618
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:18,286
I don't think 
Joe would be against it.

619
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:20,680
It's incredibly difficult 
for me.

620
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:23,396
I don't want Debbie gone.

621
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:26,528
But when people 
show me who they are,

622
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,054
I'll base it on that.

623
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,686
I still have Michele, 
you still have Joe.

624
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:33,568
I have Joe, that's for sure. 
As long as you're sure you have Michele...

625
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:36,272
- I have to make sure. 
- OK.

626
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:37,931
Aubry and I agree:

627
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:41,409
Debbie would cause our downfall 
before Scot and Jason did.

628
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:42,836
We'll have them later.

629
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,639
Aubry submitted the idea to me

630
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:50,076
that you, me, Joe and Aubry 
vote Debbie.

631
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:52,626
I say to myself... Shit!

632
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:55,023
I didn't expect to see the light of day

633
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:57,230
where the four of us would attack Debbie.

634
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:01,554
Can we discuss honestly?

635
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:04,399
Debbie worries me a little.

636
00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:07,802
She said a few 
emotional things.

637
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:10,639
She trusts Julia, 
why?

638
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,475
The girl who just spent 5 minutes 
chatting with Scot!

639
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,279
- She probably told him everything. 
- We have to vote Debbie.

640
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:19,506
No. Absolutely not.

641
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:22,422
Aubry offers to take Debbie out.

642
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:24,044
But it's useless

643
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:26,721
because we have a force 
that holds up well.

644
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:28,748
We have to stick 
with this idea: Debbie.

645
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:30,917
I don't know if there are enough of us.

646
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:33,720
If we convince Julia, 
there are always four of us.

647
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:38,400
I trust you, Cydney, 
and your instincts.

648
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:41,149
Let's talk about it with her, hoping 
she doesn't screw us.

649
00:32:41,274 --> 00:32:43,922
- Are you telling him or is it me? 
- I will tell him.

650
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,998
Now, we need to talk to Julia.

651
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,377
And it's scary, because now,

652
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,681
The person I wanted to date

653
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,408
is the one I need.

654
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:56,333
- So ? 
- Good.

655
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,204
Are you with us for real?

656
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,254
She is with us for real.

657
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:04,106
Alright, so we trust you 
on this one.

658
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:06,426
If you fuck us, I explode.

659
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,555
- No, I know. 
- Period. But really.

660
00:33:08,983 --> 00:33:10,265
We vote for Debbie.

661
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,033
- Aubry up for it? 
- Yeah.

662
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,293
I walk.

663
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:15,841
Let's shake hands. 
It's Debbie. We will do it.

664
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,433
We will do it.

665
00:33:18,116 --> 00:33:19,174
Oh my God !

666
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,907
Have a foot 
in several alliances

667
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:24,504
gave me a lot of power.

668
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:26,479
- Welcome back ! 
- Thanks !

669
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:30,877
I have the power 
to take out Debbie or Cydney.

670
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:34,547
Jason, Scot, and Tai 
really want Cydney out.

671
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:36,524
She is very dangerous

672
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:38,593
because she talks to everyone.

673
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:41,396
But I want Debbie gone sometime 
.

674
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:44,165
So my choice will decide.

675
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:01,107
Now here are 
the members of our jury.

676
00:34:06,617 --> 00:34:09,291
and Nick, eliminated at the last council.

677
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:15,693
Good. Let 's go back 
to the reward test,

678
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:18,266
where a lot of information 
was revealed.

679
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:21,696
Debbie, this tribe 
is clearly divided.

680
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:26,975
I do not remember having seen 
such a marked division.

681
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:29,586
And it was very hard,

682
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:31,213
because we don't eat.

683
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,940
We have no hatchet or machete.

684
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:36,051
So our lives

685
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,982
not figuratively,

686
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:40,806
our lives, literally, 
are in danger.

687
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,227
Is this the purpose 
of the actions of Scot, Jason and Tai?

688
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:47,929
To try to generate chaos?

689
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:50,031
So that, perhaps, 
the game fractures?

690
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:51,491
It's possible.

691
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:54,579
Water on fire, it was epic.

692
00:34:54,704 --> 00:34:57,316
Like ordering fajitas 
at a Mexican restaurant.

693
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:00,175
Everything squirted out, and it was kind 
of like a symbol of...

694
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:03,970
I love it.

695
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:05,804
Julia, there's a lot going on

696
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:08,995
and we still haven't talked 
about the reward trial,

697
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,221
where you went 
with Tai, Scot and Jason.

698
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,323
What was the reaction of others

699
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,959
when did you 
volunteer?

700
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:20,996
The alliance 
that decided to eliminate Nick

701
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,991
was okay with me going 
with Tai, Jason and Scot.

702
00:35:24,116 --> 00:35:27,502
Someone had to do it 
and I volunteered.

703
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:28,944
Debbie, you nod.

704
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:32,140
Yeah, no worries, I'm glad 
she ate well.

705
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:34,774
She deserved to eat, 
and that was brave of her

706
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,376
to propose like this,

707
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,313
because one could believe this or that.

708
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,625
I just thought 
you wanted to eat Chinese!

709
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,584
And, Michele, result:

710
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,838
big meal 
for Jason, Scot, Tai and Julia.

711
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:48,009
And see 
who is wearing the necklace today!

712
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:49,855
Yes, she is protected tonight

713
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,562
and it's a great opportunity 
to show where his loyalty lies.

714
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:55,369
She can be quiet

715
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:58,266
and vote according to the direction 
she wants to take

716
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:00,160
and the people she wants to play with.

717
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,370
And I think I know which camp it will be.

718
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:06,675
Tai, at the last tip, 
we talked about idols.

719
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:10,312
Are there any? Is there a super-idol? 
What is that ?

720
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:11,938
Maybe someone is lying!

721
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:14,216
Do you 
think idols will appear?

722
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,409
Based 
on this conversation, yes.

723
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,406
I think idols 
will appear.

724
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:19,879
If there has.

725
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,758
We could simply 
say what is going to happen.

726
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:25,460
Excellent idea !

727
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:29,322
Okay, Jason and Scot, 
what's going to happen?

728
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:31,800
Well, Tai has an idol.

729
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:37,197
Tai isn't going anywhere tonight.

730
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,241
- He's safe. 
- He stays here.

731
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:40,433
He's not moving.

732
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,124
I have an idol.

733
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:44,070
He's an idol.

734
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,448
- Can I see her ? 
- Yes.

735
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:49,484
A moment !

736
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:50,810
A moment !

737
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:53,480
The idol has a little sister!

738
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,956
There are two !

739
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:56,483
Yeah !

740
00:36:57,146 --> 00:36:59,232
- They should combine them, right? 
- Oh yeah.

741
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:05,571
- The same vote, huh? 
- Yes.

742
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:08,203
Let's see if I understand correctly.

743
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:11,168
Tai, you say, 
"I have an idol and I'm going to play it."

744
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:12,332
Clearly.

745
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,654
- We're 6 to 3. 
- They're 6 to 3.

746
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:18,713
It's 100%, 
or 30%, at least 35%.

747
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:20,507
And, Jason,

748
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:22,951
- you have another idol. 
- Exact.

749
00:37:23,356 --> 00:37:24,504
And guess what?

750
00:37:24,629 --> 00:37:25,956
We're all going to vote.

751
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:28,623
When you ask, 
"Is there an idol to play?",

752
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,850
we will get up, 
we will do paper-pebble-scissors.

753
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:32,986
The winner will be able to play the idol,

754
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:34,796
the loser will be in danger.

755
00:37:37,157 --> 00:37:38,391
Oh no.

756
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:40,135
I'll let fate decide

757
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,729
if I stay in the game, 
thanks to this idol, or if it's Scot.

758
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:49,402
Original plan.

759
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:52,113
- And, Jason, it's debatable. 
- In effect.

760
00:37:52,238 --> 00:37:53,506
Right in front of you.

761
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:54,883
In effect.

762
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:59,743
You know they say 
Tai won't let go of his idol,

763
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:02,891
but he could give it, 
and then both would have one.

764
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:06,628
We must therefore place 
our six votes wisely,

765
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:08,488
because we only have one chance.

766
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,429
It doesn't stop!

767
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:19,095
Julia, isn't it great 
to have this necklace?

768
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,275
I love it !

769
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,010
I really love it!

770
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,904
Good. Are we ready to vote?

771
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:26,748
Wait. Its good ?

772
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:29,109
- Its good ? 
- Yes it's good.

773
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:33,688
Good. Without a doubt,

774
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:37,425
one of the craziest councils 
I have ever had the pleasure of attending.

775
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,319
It's time to vote.

776
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:41,217
Cydney, over to you.

777
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:19,659
I will count the votes.

778
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:30,237
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

779
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:32,305
now is the time to do it.

780
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:43,516
One second, Jeff.

781
00:39:47,787 --> 00:39:48,788
Shit !

782
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,519
Or maybe we should 
give it to Tai.

783
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:55,729
Yeah, let's do that.

784
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,907
We give away my idol

785
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:00,400
in Tai.

786
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:03,345
I accept the idol.

787
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:08,134
And I sit down.

788
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,086
Good. Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

789
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,558
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

790
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:18,418
I will read the votes.

791
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:22,281
First vote:

792
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:27,460
It's not written like that.

793
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:30,115
Scot.

794
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,567
Cydney. Two votes Scot,

795
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:35,935
two votes Cydney.

796
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:40,148
Cydney. 
That's three Cydney votes.

797
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:42,308
Oh my God.

798
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,759
Debbie. 
That's two Debbie votes.

799
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:56,164
Debbie. Equality.

800
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:58,400
Three votes Cydney, 
three votes Debbie,

801
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,660
two Scot votes, one vote remains.

802
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,612
Eighth person eliminated 
and third member of the jury...

803
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:09,978
Debbie.

804
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:11,871
Bring me your torch.

805
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,914
They are quiet for a moment.

806
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:25,460
Debbie, the tribe has spoken.

807
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:31,815
It's time to go.

808
00:41:38,131 --> 00:41:39,992
There is rarely a theme

809
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:43,203
as evident as in this season, 
and it is very clear.

810
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,948
Even if it seems hopeless, 
nothing is ever lost.

811
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:49,484
And even if you feel 
safe,

812
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:52,120
you are not necessarily.

813
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:54,681
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

814

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

818
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:14,142
Next time in Survivor...

819
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:16,173
With the power of the super-idol...

820
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:17,837
We have a super-idol. 
We stay.

821
00:42:17,962 --> 00:42:20,463
...Jason, Scot and Tai 
feel invincible.

822
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:22,042
We are unstoppable.

823
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:25,320
But Aubry tries to snatch Tai 
from the dark side.

824
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:27,822
Tai is not like Jason and Scot.

825
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:29,482
They are despicable.

826
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,593
I do not know what to do.

827
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:33,904
The big surprise was

828
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:37,044
that the girls decide 
to eliminate a girl.

829
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:38,576
It amazes me,

830
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:43,502
and it will make it harder for them 
to defeat Scot, Jason and Tai.

831
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,914
And it really sucks

832
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,799
that these three wankers 
go further than me.

833
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:51,613
But they played better.
