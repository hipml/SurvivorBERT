1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,044
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:03,712
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:04,421
FOR THE FIRST FIVE DAYS, THE

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,464
MEN'S TRIBE WAS ON A ROLL,

5
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,800
DOMINATING EVERY CHALLENGE.

6
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,426
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

7
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,552
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ONE

8
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,261
WORLD, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

9
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,097
WE HERE IN CHARGE OF THIS GAME.

10
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,266
Jeff: LEAVING THE WOMEN OF

11
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,100
SALANI HANGING ON BY A THREAD.

12
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,436
IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,478
POSSIBLY HAVE AN EMBER?

14
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,605
I'M SORRY, I'M A REPUBLICAN,

15
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,273
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN HANDOUTS.

16
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,357
Jeff: BUT THE WOMEN

17
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,151
WEATHERED THE STORM WITH

18
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:26,776
BACK-TO-BACK VICTORIES.

19
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,113
THE WOMEN WIN IMMUNITY!

20
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,907
THINGS ARE STARTING TO FEEL

21
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,533
DIFFERENT.

22
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,576
Jeff: BUT EVEN REWARDS AND

23
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,910
SUNSHINE COULDN'T KEEP THEM FROM

24
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:36,786
EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

25
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,954
WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO

26
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,122
WORK TOGETHER?

27
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,290
IT'S GUYS VERSUS GIRLS AND

28
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,166
CHRISTINA IS PLAYING THAT SIDE

29
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,960
AND PLAYING US AT THE SAME TIME.

30
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,378
SHE'S POISON.

31
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,005
Jeff: FACING THEIR FIRST

32
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,091
TRIBAL COUNCIL, THE MISMISFIGHT

33
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,092
ALLIANCE TARGETED MAT, THE HEAD

34
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,595
OF THE MUSCLE ALLIANCE.

35
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,430
BUT COLTON WAS HARBOR AGO

36
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,848
PERSONAL VENDETTA AND WANTED TO

37
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,474
TAKE OUT BILL.

38
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,308
BILL IS THE TYPE THAT WILL

39
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,478
SLIT UP BEHIND YOU AND SLIT YOUR

40
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:01,895
THROAT.

41
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:02,604
WE KNOW THAT.

42
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,272
SO YOU NEED TO ELIMINATE THAT

43
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:04,939
FIRST.

44
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,149
YOU'RE GUTTER TRASH, THAT'S

45
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:06,816
ALL YOU ARE.

46
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,234
I CAN'T STAND HIM.

47
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,360
UGH!

48
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,821
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

49
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,948
THE MISFIT ALLIANCE DECIDED MAT

50
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:14,991
WAS A BIGGER THREAT AND HE WAS

51
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:15,450
SENT HOME.

52
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,993
TIME FOR YOU GO.

53
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,495
FIRST VOTE, FIRST BLIND SIDE,

54
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,997
GAME ON.

55
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,998
15 ARE LEFT.

56
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:33,301
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

57
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,972
.

58
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,725
GETTING BACK FROM TRIBAL IS

59
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,684
LITTLE UPSETTING BECAUSE MATT

60
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,352
WENT HOME.

61
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,603
THESE GUYS DON'T KNOW WHAT

62
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,354
THEY'RE DOING.

63
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,313
MOST OF THOSE GUYS ARE WEAK AND

64
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,356
THEY WANT TO KEEP THE WEAK GUYS

65
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,023
AROUND.

66
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:47,732
YOU HAVE THE OLD GUY, YOU HAVE

67
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,317
TO LITTLE GUY, OFF GAY GUY WHO

68
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,402
DOESN'T WANT TO WORK.

69
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,529
IF THEY WANT TO VOTE OUT THE

70
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,905
STRONG GUYS THEY CAN CONTINUE TO
LOSE

71
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,364
LOSE.

72
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:54,697
THAT WENT WELL.

73
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,240
YEAH.

74
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,700
HERE'S THE THING REAL

75
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,409
QUICKLY.

76
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,829
MIKE IS SO PERIPHERAL, HE HAS NO

77
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,538
CLUE.

78
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,205
WE CAN LET HIM FLOAT A LITTLE

79
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,374
BIT BEFORE WE VOTE HIM OUT.

80
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,210
IT WAS GOOD FOR US THAT WE HAD

81
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,545
TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE

82
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,048
I TRULY FELT THE FIVE OF US WERE

83
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:12,715
SOLID.

84
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,384
THE FIVE ARE MYSELF AND TROYZAN,

85
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,555
JONAS, COLTON AND LEE.

86
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,389
WE STAND SOLID AT THE MOMENT FOR

87
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,390
AT LEAST THE FIRST ROUND.

88
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,767
SO THE NEXT GUY IS BILLY,

89
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,352
BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE MOST LIKELY

90
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,562
TO PULL SOMEBODY AWAY FROM US.

91
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,396
GOOD CALL.

92
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,898
BILL'S VERY DANGEROUS.

93
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,401
HE'S CAPABLE OF LOOSENING THE

94
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,570
TIES THAT BIND US FIVE WITH HIS

95
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,363
CHARM, HIS BEGUILING CHARACTER.

96
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,239
HE'S A SMART COOKIE.

97
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,575
YEAH, AND HE'S DANGEROUS.

98
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,242
OH, YEAH, I BELIEVE THAT.

99
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,579
SO TOMORROW WE'RE SOLIDIFY

100
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,079
THAT IDEA.

101
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:53,173
OKAY.

102
00:02:53,256 --> 00:03:13,443
OKAY.

103
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,403
GOOD MORNING!

104
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,656
ARE YOU EXCITING LOOKING AT

105
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,658
YOUR GOOD HEARTY BREAKFAST?

106
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,200
OOH.

107
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,786
GOOD OLD SNAILS FOR

108
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,412
BREAKFAST.

109
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,496
THE WOMEN HAVE HAD A HUGE

110
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,205
TURNAROUND.

111
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,081
WE WON THE LAST TWO CHALLENGES

112
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,416
AND WE'RE NOT STARVING.

113
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,336
I MEAN, REALLY AND TRULY BETWEEN

114
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,630
COCONUT, SNAILS, AND THE RICE,

115
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,340
WE REALLY COULD PROBABLY GO ON

116
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,467
FOR 31 MORE DAYS.

117
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,968
I MEAN, I COULD.

118
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:46,309
IT'S MIND OVER MATTER.

119
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:46,976
NICE.

120
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,437
WE'RE PRETTY

121
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,021
SOPHISTICATED.

122
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,356
OKAY, SO DID YOU GUYS USE

123
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,190
THAT NET YET?

124
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,275
YEAH, WE TRIED TO USE IT

125
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:54,943
YESTERDAY.

126
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,653
IF YOU GUYS WANT... I'M FROM

127
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,403
HAWAII.

128
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,655
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, I'VE

129
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,782
USED A NET BEFORE AND I KNOW

130
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,659
EXACTLY WHERE TO LAY IT AND WHEN

131
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,078
TO LAY IT AND HOW LONG TO LAY

132
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:05,620
IT.

133
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,039
SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE

134
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:08,748
PROPOSING.

135
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,333
IF WE COULD USE THE NET WE'RE

136
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,793
WILLING TO GIVE YOU HALF OF IT.

137
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,503
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

138
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,546
I JUST THINK IT'S HILARIOUS AT

139
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,091
THE BEGINNING IT WAS US

140
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:18,841
STRUGGLING AND NOW THE BOYS COME

141
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,510
BY WANTING EVERYTHING WE WIN IN

142
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,177
CHALLENGES.

143
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,846
IT'S JUST CRAZY HOW MUCH THE

144
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,390
ROLES HAVE REVERSED IN NINE

145
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,057
DAYS.

146
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,101
I KNOW I PROBABLY SOUND LIKE

147
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,852
A COLDHEARTED BITCH AND I'M NOT.

148
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,354
BUT WE CAN'T BE FEEDING OUR

149
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,021
ENEMIES.

150
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,481
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT,

151
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,024
WE'RE FINE WITH THAT.

152
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,651
WE'RE GETTING ENOUGH FOOD AS IT

153
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,360
IS.

154
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,027
BUT IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER FOR

155
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,028
BOTH OF US.

156
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,696
THINK ABOUT IT, WE'RE DOING ALL

157
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,572
THE WORK AND YOU'RE GETTING HALF

158
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,323
OF IT?

159
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,033
I DON'T REALLY CARE EITHER WAY.

160
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,702
YOU DON'T CARE EITHER WAY?

161
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,411
I THINK JONAS IS A REAL RUDE

162
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,120
DUDE.

163
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,038
HE MADE THE OFFER WITH THE NET

164
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,832
AND THEN KEPT SAYING "I MEAN, I

165
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,499
DON'T CARE.

166
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,375
I DON'T CARE.

167
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,042
I DON'T CARE."

168
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
BUT OBVIOUSLY HE CARES A LOT.

169
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,337
IT WOULD JUST BE A LOT EASIER

170
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,380
FOR BOTH OF US.

171
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,381
YOU GUYS CAN THINK ABOUT THAT

172
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,382
AND GET BACK TO US.

173
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,092
THE WOMEN, THEY'RE TRYING TO

174
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,219
BE SUCH HARD-NOSES, I DON'T GET

175
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:03,886
THAT.

176
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,637
I DON'T KNOW IF THEIR EMOTIONS

177
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,388
ARE TURNING THEM WHACKY OR WHAT

178
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,849
BUT THEY'RE EMOTIONAL CREATURES

179
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,225
AND THEY CAN'T SEEM TO THINK

180
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:09,809
STRAIGHT.

181
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,561
DON'T THINK I'M A BITCH!

182
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,437
WELL, YOU JUST MADE A BITCH

183
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,062
MOVE.

184
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,940
SO THEY'RE DOING NOTHING.

185
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:16,774
THEY CAN SUN TAN ON THE BEACH

186
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,567
WHILE WE GO FISH AND BRING THEM

187
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,401
HALF OF THE FOOD.

188
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,194
(LAUGHS)

189
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,404
LIKE, HELLO?

190
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:30,747

00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,847
NO, LUCK!

382
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,223
Jeff: LUCK?

383
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:22,807
PURE LUCK.

384
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,101
LUCK, I DON'T THINK SO.

385
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,394
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WOMEN.

386
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,645
THREE VERY DIFFERENT CHOICES OF

387
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,062
REWARD.

388
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:28,938
OH, MY GOD.

389
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,399
A DIET, GIRLS, GOT TO BE

390
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:31,774
TARP.

391
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,316
YEAH, TARP.

392
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,734
IT'S GOT TO BE TARP.

393
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,318
Jeff: WHAT'S THE CHOICE?

394
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,737
CHOICE IS THE TARP, JEFF.

395
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,947
Jeff: WOMEN, GET YOUR

396
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,948
REWARD, HEAD BACK TO CAMP AND

397
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,157
GET IT SET UP.

398
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:40,658
NICE JOB.

399
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,451
GREAT JOB, LADIES.

400
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:42,993
BYE!

401
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,079
OH, YEAH, BYE, BYE.

402
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,414
Jeff: WELL, WHAT APPEARED

403
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,748
EARLY ON TO HAVE THE MAKINGS OF

404
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,500
A BLOWOUT IS CLEARLY A VERY

405
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,626
COMPETITIVE GAME BETWEEN THE MEN

406
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,461
AND THE WOMEN.

407
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,629
GUYS, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

408
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,005
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

409
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:05,933
CAMP.

410
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:11,272
CAMP.

411
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,982
ANOTHER "W" BABIES.

412
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,817
GOOD JOB, EVERYONE.

413
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,485
GOOD JOB.

414
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,611
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD IN THE

415
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,446
THE BAG.

416
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,823
SALANI ON THREE?

417
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,158
ONE, TWO, THREE, SALANI!

418
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,826
IT WAS SO GOOD TO WIN THE

419
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,535
REWARD CHALLENGE.

420
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,828
WHEN WE HIT THAT LAST ONE YOU

421
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,204
COULD TELL IT SUCKED ALL THE AIR

422
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:27,830
OUT OF THEM.

423
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,539
I DIDN'T CARE.

424
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,833
TARZAN WAS OVER WITH HIS CRUSTY

425
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,959
ASS TALKING ABOUT "IT'S JUST

426
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,004
LUCK, IT'S JUST LUCK" LUCK

427
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:35,588
THESE.

428
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,465
SO WHAT THEY GOT A TARP.

429
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,007
THE CHALLENGE ITSELF WAS KIND

430
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,675
OF A FLUKE.

431
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,176
WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO

432
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:40,759
LEARN THE GAME.

433
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,512
NEITHER DID THEY, THOUGH.

434
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,514
IT'S PRETTY MUCH DEAD EVEN.

435
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,057
THEY HAVE A TARP; WE HAVE A

436
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:47,725
TARP.

437
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,351
THE GAME IS NOT EASY, DUDE,

438
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,686
WE'RE UP ONE PERSON.

439
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,521
I WILL TAKE ONE PERSON UP OVER

440
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,023
ALL THE DOUGHNUTS IN THE WORLD.

441
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,524
TO BE HONEST, WE GOT OUR

442
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,484
BUTTS KICKED.

443
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,860
THESE WOMEN AREN'T SLOUCHES SO

444
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,069
WE NEED TO STOP THINKING ABOUT

445
00:12:59,153 --> 00:12:59,945
THEM AS JUST SOME CHICKS OVER

446
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,698
THERE BECAUSE THE MOMENTUM AND

447
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,366
"OH, WE'VE WON THREE; THEY'VE

448
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,118
WON THREE" THAT'S OUT THE

449
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,369
WINDOW, MAN!

450
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,706
WE JUST NEED TO WIN THESE

451
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,332
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES, BRO.

452
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,249
I KNOW.

453
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:12,917
THOSE CHICKS ARE TOUGH.

454
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,503
THOSE ARE SOME SERIOUS

455
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,045
COMPETITORS, MAN.

456
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,922
FOR SURE, DEFINITELY.

457
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,257
I'D LOVE TO FIND AN IDOL.

458
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,885
YEAH, ME, TOO.

459
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,886
THAT'D MAKE ME FEEL SO MUCH

460
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,470
BETTER.

461
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,514
I'M DEFINITELY GLAD TO

462
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,516
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU.

463
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,892
WHEN COLTON SAID TO VOTE FOR

464
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,560
YOU, I DIDN'T REALLY WANT THAT,

465
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,269
YOU KNOW?

466
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:37,691
COLTON SAID THAT?

467
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,152
YEAH.

468
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:40,528
YEAH.

469
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,195
WOW.

470
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,488
AND... DON'T TELL HIM THAT.

471
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:42,905
I WON'T.

472
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,614
I WON'T.

473
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,699
AND THEN EVERYONE CAME TO THE

474
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,535
DECISION THAT IT SHOULD BE MATT

475
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,577
BECAUSE, I MEAN, WE DIDN'T

476
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,245
REALLY KNOW WHERE YOUR HEAD WAS

477
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,913
AT AND, I MEAN, WE'RE ALL ON THE

478
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,123
SAME PAGE NOW.

479
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,920
BOYS AND GIRLS, BILL JUST GOT

480
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,587
WOWED.

481
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,713
TURNS OUT MY NAME WAS WAY MORE

482
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,049
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK THAN I

483
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,592
THOUGHT IT WAS AT THE LAST

484
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,260
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

485
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,428
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT

486
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,096
HAPPENS

487
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,265
BRO.

488
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:09,974
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME.

489
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,935
NAME OF THE BEAST.

490
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,270
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING, NOW

491
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,104
THAT I KNOW THE GLOVES ARE OFF

492
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,063
AND IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME.

493
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,399
JUST KEEP EVERYTHING BETWEEN

494
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,066
US, YOU KNOW?

495
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,068
IF I FIND AN IDOL, BRO, I'LL

496
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:26,991
LET YOU KNOW, I SWEAR IT.

497
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,618
I SAW LEIF TALKING TO BILL

498
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,620
AND, LIKE, THEY WERE A GOOD

499
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,288
CONVERSATION.

500
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,414
I SWEAR TO GOD IT'S THAT GUY

501
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,123
LEIF, MAN.

502
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,626
THAT LITTLE MUNCHKIN IS ABOUT

503
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,169
TO GET KNOCKED BACK TO OZ.

504
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:39,712
WHERE IS HE?

505
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,171
CALL LEIF OVER HERE.

506
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,464
HEY, LEIF.

507
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,008
COLTON WANTS YOU.

508
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,134
THE MISFITS ARE RUNNING THE SHOW

509
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,802
RIGHT NOW.

510
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,511
I THINK THERE'S A TARGET ON MY

511
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,722
BACK SO I NEED TO DO SOMETHING

512
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,431
AND COLTON AND I WERE TALKING

513
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,474
ABOUT LEIF BECAUSE I SEE LEIF AS

514
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,684
WORKING ALL SIDES HERE.

515
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,435
SO I BROUGHT LEIF INTO THE MIX

516
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,312
JUST TO ADD ONE MORE CUSHION IN

517
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,438
FRONT OF ME.

518
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,482
DID YOU TELL BILL THAT HE WAS

519
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:00,899
NEXT?

520
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,984
DID I TELL BILL?

521
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,568
YEAH.

522
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,445
I WAS JUST TRYING TO... I

523
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,154
DIDN'T TELL HIM.

524
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,822
I DIDN'T STRAIGHT UP TELL HIM,

525
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,616
YEAH, WE'RE VOTING FOR YOU, BRO.

526
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,867
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

527
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,993
I'M GIVING YOU A CHANCE RIGHT

528
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,702
NOW.

529
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,786
IF YOU TOLD HIM, TELL ME, AND

530
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,495
I'LL TRY TO DO WHAT I CAN.

531
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,664
BUT IF YOU LIE TO ME AGAIN...

532
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,498
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

533
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,542
I DIDN'T EVEN SAY THAT.

534
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,877
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

535
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,211
OKAY, YES, I DID.

536
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,129
YOU TOLD HIM?

537
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,505
I APOLOGIZED.

538
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,173
YOU TOLD HIM WE WERE AFTER

539
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:24,840
HIM?

540
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,051
YOU PRETTY MUCH SEALED YOUR

541
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:27,760
FATE.

542
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,802
IT'S A TIGHT RACE BETWEEN LEIF

543
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,846
AND BILL FOR WHO IS THE MOST

544
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,139
WISHY-WASHY PLAYER IN THIS GAME.

545
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,309
BILL'S MORE SNEAKY WHEREAS LEIF

546
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,686
IS MORE STUPID.

547
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,481
HE'S TURNING INTO AN ANNOYING

548
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,190
LITTLE OOMPA LOOMPA.

549
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:41,607
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT NO ONE

550
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,858
HERE TRUSTS YOU?

551
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:43,525
I KNOW.

552
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,027
YOU ARE DIGGING YOUR OWN

553
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,361
GRAVE.

554
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:45,694
I KNOW.

555
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,362
I JUST...

556
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,030
WELL, I TOLD YOU TO PICK A

557
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,241
SIDE AND YOU PICKED THE WRONG

558
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:51,867
SIDE.

559
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,744
TODAY I PUT THE BIGGEST

560
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,163
ULTIMATE FOOT IN MY MOUTH AND

561
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,123
RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY HAS REALLY

562
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,209
LOST TRUST IN ME.

563
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,879
I REALLY HOPE THAT I CAN SOMEHOW

564
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,048
REGAIN THAT BECAUSE IF NOT I

565
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,176
COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING HOME.

566
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:22,231
I REALLY DID IT THIS TIME.

567
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,359
TREEMAIL!

568
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,110

569
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,405
ALL RIGHT, GUYS LET'S ALL PUT

570
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:29,697

571
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,156
CORNERS.

572
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,241
ANOTHER CORNER.

573
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,245
ALL RIGHT.

574
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,956
"WHEN PAIRS OF MINDS WORK

575
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,582
TOGETHER, BEING WELL BALANCED IS

576
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,084
AN IMPORTANT PART.

577
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,253
YOU CAN'T OUTRUN A VOTE AGAINST

578
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,132
YOU, SO TODAY YOU'LL JUST HAVE

579
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,384

580
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,135
WHEN PAIRS OF MINDS WORK

581
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,595
TOGETHER" SO WE'RE WORKING IN

582
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,263
TWOS.

583
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,097
I WOULD LIKE TO BE PARTNERED

584
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,307
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S GOOD AT

585
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,768
PUZZLES BECAUSE I'M BAD AT THEM.

586
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,603
WE CAN USE THE SAME PARTNERS.

587
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,606
YOU'RE GOOD AT PUZZLES?

588
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,232
I JUST PUT THAT TOGETHER,

589
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:05,899
REALLY.

590
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,111
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.

591
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,612
ARE YOU CALL MEGASTUPID?

592
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,780

593
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,449
PUZZLE AND RIGHT AWAY KAT SAYS

594
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,450
"I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

595
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,285
YOU CAN'T DO NO PUZZLES."

596
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,746
AND RIGHT THEN AND THERE THAT

597
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,289
PISSED ME OFF AND I HAD TO CHECK

598
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:20,956
HER.

599
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,623
ME INTENTION WASN'T SAYING

600
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,625
THE PARTNER I HAD LAST TIME

601
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,710
WASN'T SMART ENOUGH TO BE MY

602
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,294
PARTNER NOW.

603
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,171
THAT'S HOW YOU TOOK IT?

604
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,464
I SO DIDN'T TAKE IT THAT WAY.

605
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,132
I TOOK IT THAT WAY.

606
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,425
OKAY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

607
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,092
RECAP IT.

608
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,635
KAT WAS SAYING LOOK, I'M NOT

00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,707
THE ONLY GOOD NEWS TO BEING

759
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,291
BEHIND IS THERE'S A MODEL RIGHT

760
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,710
NEXT DOOR TO LOOK AT.

761
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,503
HEY, QUIT LOOKING AT OUR

762
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,713
PUZZLE!

763
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,672
CHEATER!

764
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,172
CHEATER!

765
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:39,840
DON'T YOU DO THAT.

766
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,758
TARZAN, YOU'RE GOING TO GET

767
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,427
SLAPPED, DUDE.

768
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,761
YEAH!

769
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,846
COME ON, BOYS!

770
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,430
Jeff: THE MEN HAVE THEIR

771
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,473
THIRD PUZZLE SOLVED.

772
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,017
THEY'VE GOT THE THIRD KEY AND

773
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,851
THEY'RE HEADING BACK.

774
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,060
COME ON, TROY!

775
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,773
COME ON, BILL!

776
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,065
YAY!

777
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:57,607
YAY!

778
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,442
Jeff: THE MEN HAVE THREE

779
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,109
KEYS.

780
00:21:59,192 --> 00:21:59,776
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS OPEN

781
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,528
THREE LOCKS AND IMMUNITY IS

782
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,572
THEIRS ONCE AGAIN.

783
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,239
Jeff: .

784
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,699
DON'T GIVE UP GIRLS, WE GOT

785
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:05,991
IT.

786
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:06,575
(LAUGHS)

787
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,745
Jeff: LEIF HAS THE FIRST

788
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,705
LOCK UNDONE.

789
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,289
YES!

790
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,041
Jeff: LEIF HAS THE SECOND

791
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:14,583
LOCK OPEN.

792
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,543
IT'S NOT ONE WORLD, IT'S

793
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,085
LEIF'S WORLD.

794
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,212
Jeff: LEIF HAS THE THIRD

795
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,088
LOCK UNDONE!

796
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,715
LEIF RAISES THE FLAG!

797
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,592
MEN WOMEN IMMUNITY!

798
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:35,604
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

799
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,065
MEN, CONGRATULATIONS.

800
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:38,774
(APPLAUSE)

801
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,069
IMMUNITY ONCE AGAIN IS YOURS.

802
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,737
(CHANTING)

803
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,947
THAT WAS A BLOWOUT.

804
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,909
THAT BARELY QUALIFIED AS A

805
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,576
CHALLENGE.

806
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,911
ALICIA, YOU AND CHELSEA WERE

807
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,329
STILL WORKING ON THE FIRST

808
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,914
PUZZLE AND THE MEN WERE NEARLY

809
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,831
DONE WITH THE ENTIRE CHALLENGE.

810
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,457
I KNOW.

811
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,085
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

812
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:58,794
Jeff: HOW DO YOU LAUGH?

813
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,296
IT'S LIKE, "OH, CAN'T WAIT TO

814
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,756
TELL EVERYBODY HOW BAD THAT

815
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,131
WAS."

816
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,049
NOT AT ALL.

817
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,259
I THINK I LET THEM DOWN.

818
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:06,927
THAT WAS AN EASY PUZZLE AND I

819
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,636
DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG.

820
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,639
Jeff: YOU WALKED OVER,

821
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,640
LOOKED AT IT AND COULDN'T GET

822
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,015
IT.

823
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,810
I HEAR YOU.

824
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,019
Jeff: MEN, NO TRIBAL

825
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:16,645
COUNCIL TONIGHT, ENJOY THE NIGHT

826
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,354
OFF.

827
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,605
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

828
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:18,980
CAMP.

829
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,483
NICE WORK.

830
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,318
WOMEN, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

831
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,319
SOMEBODY ELSE FROM YOUR TRIBE

832
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,655
WILL BE OUT OF THIS GAME FOR

833
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,405
GOOD.

834
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,824
YOU HAVE TO AFTERNOON TO FIGURE

835
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,991
OUT WHO IT WILL BE.

836
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:30,659
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

837
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,326
CAMP.

838
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:31,993
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

839
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,620
ALICIA'S ATTITUDE AFTER THE

840
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,539
CHALLENGE WAS REPULSIVE.

841
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,332
BUT THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE TO MY

842
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,208
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE NOW ALL THE

843
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:38,917
GIRLS ARE COMING TO THINK THAT

844
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,294
IT'S TIME FOR ALICIA TO GO AND

845
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,130
WHEN THERE'S A WEAK LINK, YOU'VE

846
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:53,181
JUST GOT TO TAKE IT OUT.

847
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:58,228
JUST GOT TO TAKE IT OUT.

848
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,521
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, BOYS,

849
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,690
GREAT JOB.

850
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,357
SWEET.

851
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,526
EVERY SINGLE PERSON PULLED THEIR

852
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,152
WEIGHT.

853
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,695
THAT'S IT FOR THOSE GIRLS,

854
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,237
MAN.

855
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,904
HE'S BACK IN OUR CAMP.

856
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,032
THAT ONE WE CAME THROUGH AND

857
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:11,992
WE CRUSHED IT.

858
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:12,701
WE PULLED OUT A WIN WHEN WE

859
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,245
DEFINITELY NEEDED IT, MAN.

860
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,372
AND IT MAY HAVE SAVED MY BUTT

861
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,540
BECAUSE I'M ON THE OUTS WITH THE

862
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,208
TRIBE BUT NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO

863
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,543
TRIBAL AND IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT

864
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:27,299
LITTLE RED DEVIL BACK AT CAMP.

865
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,092
OKAY, I KIND OF WANT TO KNOW

866
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:29,926
WHAT HAPPENED.

867
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,552
I.

868
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,387
I'M NOT MAKING ANY EXCUSES

869
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,055
BUT IT DID LOOK A LOT EASIER

870
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,723
THAN IT WAS.

871
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,766
CHELSEA AND I WE REALLY DID

872
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,143
TRY AND I THINK FOR THE MOST

873
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,853
PART WE DO A GREAT JOB IN OUR

874
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,812
OTHER CHALLENGES SO HOPEFULLY

875
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,479
THAT DOESN'T...

876
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,772
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY ONE

877
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,857
OF US.

878
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,901
TOMORROW IS A NEW DAY.

879
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,569
WHEN IT COMES TO CHALLENGES,

880
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,237
I'M USED TO PEOPLE JUST LIKE,

881
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,031
YOU KNOW, LET'S GO TO WAR.

882
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:51,740
SO ALICIA LAUGHING ABOUT THE

883
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,451
LOSS, THAT RIGHT THERE PISSED ME

884
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,160
OFF.

885
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,453
THAT'S LIKE SALT IN THE WOUND

886
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,204
TODAY.

887
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:57,871
ALICIA IS JUST DEAD WEIGHT WITH

888
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,622
A MOUTH.

889
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:02,250
LET ME KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

890
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:02,709
ALICIA'S GOT TO GO.

891
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,586
WHAT?

892
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,712
ALICIA DOES NOT WANT TO BE

893
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,171
HERE.

894
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:06,796
SHE HAS NO FIGHT.

895
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,633
I KNOW BUT... I JUST DON'T

896
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,885
KNOW THAT CHRISTINA'S

897
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,386
CONTRIBUTING ANY MORE THAN

898
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,095
ALICIA.

899
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,263
SHE'S CONTRIBUTING A LOT MORE

900
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:15,597
AT CAMP.

901
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,431
NO DOUBT.

902
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:20,268
AND WHO'S HAD BEEF BETWEEN

903
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:20,852
PEOPLE?

904
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,686
THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

905
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,606
FOR SURE I THOUGHT CHRISTINA

906
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,441
WAS THE LOCKED IN VOTE TO GO.

907
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,902
SO THE MOOD IS WEIRD NOW.

908
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,070
SABRINA IS TRYING TO SHAKE

909
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,863
THINGS UP AND THAT MAKES ME A

910
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,489
LITTLE NERVOUS.

911
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,240
I DON'T KNOW.

912
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,659
IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING

913
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,829
AFTERNOON.

914
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,956
HEY COLTON.

915
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,539
WHAT?

916
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,625
LET ME TALK TO YOU FOR A

917
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:43,875
MOMENT.

918
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:44,542
WHY?

919
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,295
I WANT TO SQUASH SOME BEEF,

920
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:47,963
HANDLE IT LIKE ADULTS.

921
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,215
I DON'T WANT TO TALK.

922
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:50,924
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRIBAL

923
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,676
COUNCIL, WE'RE NOT VOTING ANYONE

924
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,301
OFF.

925
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:53,969
YO, YO, LISTEN, PERSON TO

926
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,096
PERSON, HUMAN TO HUMAN, MAN TO

927
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:56,680
MAN.

928
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,347
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT

929
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,098
CRAP.

930
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:58,640
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT CRAP.

931
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,307
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

932
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,809
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU RIGHT

933
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,518
NOW.

934
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,687
LISTEN, BRO, I DON'T KNOW WHY

935
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,771
YOU DON'T LIKE ME, MAN, OR WHAT

936
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,814
I'VE DONE TO UPSET YOU.

937
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,691
ALL I KNOW IS YOU HAVE BEEN

938
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,484
THE MOST WISHY-WASHY PLAYER IN

939
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,193
THIS ENTIRE TRIBE.

940
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,736
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO.

941
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,821
OH, MY GOD, BILL YOU'RE GOING

942
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,656
HOME NEXT, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

943
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,366
THE FOUR OF US WENT OVER...

944
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,492
BYE.

945
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,910
THERE'S CLEARLY FRICTION

946
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,662
BETWEEN ME AND COLTON SO I WENT

947

MAN AND HE DECIDED HE DIDN'T

949
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,124
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

950
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,710
AND NOTHING GETS ME MORE

951
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,544
FRUSTRATED THAN WHEN SOMEBODY

952
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,878
DOES NOT WANT TO TALK.

953
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,130
WHEN I DON'T LIKE SOMEONE I

00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,464
DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM, I DON'T

955

00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,342
DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND THEM.

957
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,886
I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND YOU.

958
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,429
PERIOD.

959
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,388

00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,723

00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:45,979
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

966
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,231

TO PEOPLE EVERYTHING YOU WANT

970
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,027

00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:52,902
MOVE.

973
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,528
NO, DUDE.

974
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,196
I ABSOLUTELY HATE BILL.

975
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,239
I HATE HIS VOICE.

976
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,407
I HATE HIS JOKES.

977
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,533
HE'S NOT FUNNY.

978
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,410
LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M A STANDUP

979
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:00,702
COMEDIAN.

980
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,202
SHUT UP.

981
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,662
GET A REAL JOB.

982
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,538
YOU ARE DISGUSTING.

983
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,247
I HATE HIM.

984
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,499
I WANT HIS HEAD ON A PLATTER.

985
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,542
I WANT HIM GONE.

986
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,336
BILL JUST ATTACKED ME LIKE GOT

987
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,378
UP IN MY FACE.

988
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,422
LIKE STARTED YELLING AT ME.

989
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,174
LEIF TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS NEXT.

990
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,051
THAT'S WHAT LEIF SAID?

991
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:16,885
WHAT A BUNCH OF KNUCKLE

992
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,510
HEADS.

993
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,097
BILL IS A CRAZY PERSON.

994
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,350
I HATE HIM MAYBE I SHOULD GO TO

995
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,726
THOSE GIRLS AND SAY DO Y'ALL

996
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,728
WANT TO TRADE AND WE'LL GO TO

997
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,228
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE WE HAVE

998
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,733
MORE TO DEAL WITH.

999
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,902
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING.

1000
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,279
WOULD YOU BE WILLING?

1001
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,073
BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING... I

1002
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,366
KNOW Y'ALL WANT TO GO TO THE

1003
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,742
MERGE WITH NUMBERS BUT IF YOU GO

1004
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,285
TO THE MERGE WITH NUMBERS THAT

1005
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,120
AREN'T ON YOUR SIDE IT DOESN'T

1006
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:44,788
MATTER.

1007
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,748
THAT'S A... I'VE NEVER HEARD

1008
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,751
OF ANYONE DOING THIS.

1009
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,586
WE JUST WON IMMUNITY AND

1010
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,420
COLTON'S SAYING WE SHOULD GIVE

1011
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,546
IT AWAY.

1012
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,174
AND I'M THINKING WHAT?

1013
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,093
THIS IS A HUGE MOVE, DUDE.

1014
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:58,927
BUT IT'S A SMART MOVE IN THE

1015
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,594
END.

1016
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,930
I DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA BUT AT

1017
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,766
THIS POINT COLTON'S CALLING THE

1018
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,433
SHOTS.

1019
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,102
SO WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY, NO?

1020
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,270
IF I DO THAT, COLTON MIGHT PUT A

1021
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,605
TARGET ON MY BACK.

1022
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,189
WE CAN GIVE THE GIRLS

1023
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,899
IMMUNITY AND GO TO TRIBAL

1024
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,567
COUNCIL AND VOTE OUT BILL.

1025
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,527
SAY WHAT?

1026
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,444
YEAH.

1027
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,570
SHUT UP!

1028
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,738
HONESTLY.

1029
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,280
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SMARTEST

1030
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,907
MOVE FOR US BECAUSE...

1031
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,118
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1032
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,787
I THINK THAT'S A HASTY DECISION.

1033
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,580
LEIF TOLD BILL HE WAS GETTING

1034
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,164
VOTED OUT.

1035
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:28,915
BILL GOES CRAZY.

1036
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,626
SO NOW COLTON'S LIKE LET'S GIVE

1037
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,962
THE GIRLS OUR IMMUNITY IDOL AND

1038
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,130
VOTE BILL OUT RIGHT NOW.

1039
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,005
BUT LEIF IS A LOOSE CANNON, TOO.

1040
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,799
HE'S WORKING BOTH SIDES.

1041
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,593
LET'S THINK ABOUT IT FOR A

1042
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,469
SECOND.

1043
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:41,886
YEAH.

1044
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,971
LISTEN, BUDDY...

1045
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,764
I AGREE.

1046
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,473
LET'S GIVE...

1047
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,183
WE'VE GOT TO GO IN NOW AND DO

1048
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:47,809
THAT.

1049
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,476
WHEN A GROUP OF MEN GET

1050
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,894
TOGETHER AND MAKE A PACT, YOU

1051
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,481
BETRAY THEM, THAT'S A BREACH OF

1052
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,149
FAITH.

1053
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,817
SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

1054
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,652
THIS AND WE'VE GOT TO DO IT

1055
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,319
TONIGHT.

1056
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,279
WE'RE THINKING OF LETTING YOU

1057
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,156
GUYS STAY AND WE GO TO TRIBAL

1058
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:01,406
COUNCIL.

1059
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:01,948
WHY?

1060
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,826
WE HAVE A BETRAYAL.

1061
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,828
WHAT HAPPENED?

1062
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,204
THEY WANT TO GO TO TRIBAL.

1063
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:08,997
ARE YOU JOKING?

1064
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,457
NOPE.

1065
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,625
OH, MY GOD!

1066
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,419
THEY'VE REALLY LOST THEIR

1067
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,295
MIND.

1068
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,173
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, LEIF, I'M

1069
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,675
SORRY, BUT WHAT YOU DID IS

1070
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:21,342
EGREGIOUS.

1071
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,677
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT.

1072
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,304
THAT WAS BAD.

1073
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,014
AND THE BEST THING TO DO IS GIVE

1074
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,850
THE GIRLS THE IDOL AND GO TO

1075
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,018
TRIBAL TONIGHT RATHER THAN

1076
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,019
SMOLDER ABOUT IT FOR GOD KNOWS

1077
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,021
HOW MANY DAYS.

1078
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:33,688
WAIT.

1079
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,981
WHEN WE GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

1080
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,191
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?

1081
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,653
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE LEIF OUT.

1082
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,197
TARZAN GAVE THIS HUGE SPEECH

1083
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,698
ABOUT HOW HE'S SENDING LEIF HOME

1084
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:44,991
BUT I THOUGHT COLTON WANTED TO

1085
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:45,700
VOTE OUT BILL.

1086
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,869
SO I'M LIKE WHAT IN THE WORLD IS

1087
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,579
GOING ON?

1088
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,206
WHAT DO YOU THINK ALL OF US

1089
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,500
SHOULD DO?

1090
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,251
I TRULY AM SORRY, GUYS.

1091
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,212
I MEAN I JUST WANT TO BE 100%

1092
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,004
YOU WITH YOU GUYS.

1093
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,047
YOU HAVE BETRAYED US.

1094
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,674
THAT MEANS YOU WILL NOT BE

1095
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,092
TRUSTED AND YOU WILL BE, WHETHER

1096
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,844
YOU VOTE ON THIS TONIGHT OR NOT,

1097
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,055
BULL THE FIRST TO GO.

1098
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,349
IT'S AMAZING.

1099
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,434
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT DRAMA IN

1100
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,268
THEIR HOUSE AFTER A WIN.

1101
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,186
I DON'T CARE.

1102
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,729
LET THEM FALL APART.

1103
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,439
I WOULD LOVE NOT TO GO TO TRIBAL

1104
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:16,981
COUNCIL.

1105
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,108
THE MANONO TRIBE HAS

1106
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,318
ABSOLUTELY LOST THEIR MARBLES.

1107
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,444
THEY'RE NOT A TRIBE.

1108
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,570
THEY'RE NOT WORKING TOGETHER.

1109
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,238
WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE IF THEY

1110
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,115
DO THIS, IT GIVES THE SALANI

1111
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,742
TRIBE THAT BIG BOOST THAT WE

1112
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:28,326
NEEDED.

1113
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,078
OKAY, MIGHT AS WELL VOTE.

1114
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,788
WE ALL HAVE TO AGREE ON IT

1115
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,247
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO IT UNLESS

1116
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,039
WE ALL AGREE.

1117
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,916
WHO WANTS TO GO TO TRIBAL

1118
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,084
COUNCIL RAISE THEIR HAND.

1119
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,752
I DO.

1120
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,921
COME ON.

1121
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,589
HOW ABOUT YOU, BILL?

1122
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,383
MAN THIS GAME IS CRAZY.

1123
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,551
BUT IF I VOTE WITH THE REST OF

1124
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,927
THE GROUP TO GO TO TRIBAL AND

1125
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,721
VOTE LEIF OFF WELL HE'S IN HOT

1126
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,265
WATER AND PEOPLE ARE ANGRY, THAT

1127
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,058
SERVES MY PURPOSE IMMENSELY.

1128
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,311
I'LL HAVE YOU GUYS KNOW I AM

1129
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,062
COMPLETELY BUM-PUZZLED RIGHT

1130
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:56,729
NOW.

1131
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,189
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF

1132
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:58,815
THIS.

1133
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,733
THE GUYS ARE VERY CONFUSED

1134
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,442
RIGHT NOW.

1135
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,777
BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO GET

1136
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,946
PEOPLE TO DO WHAT I WANT AND I

1137
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,115
WANT BILL GONE.

1138
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,616
I'M RUNNING THIS ENTIRE SHOW

1139
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,325
RIGHT NOW.

1140
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,619
IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT, YOU ARE

1141
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,245
HELEN KELLER.

1142
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,079
JUST KNOW THIS, NO

1143
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,956
FOOLISHNESS LIKE THAT WOULD EVER

1144
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,332
GO DOWN IN THIS TRIBE.

1145
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:16,666
EVER.

1146
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,333
NO WAY.

1147
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,127
I JUST HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO

1148
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,795
GO TO TRIBAL AND VOTE SOMEBODY

1149
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:30,847
OFF.

1150
00:31:30,930 --> 00:32:06,799
OFF.

1151
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:13,389
24 SEASONS, SOME 400 TRIBAL

1152
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,057
COUNCILS.

1153
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,017
NEVER HAD A TRIBE ARRIVE AT

1154
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,647
TRIBAL COUNCIL AFTER WINNING

1155
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,356
IMMUNITY.

1156
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,357
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY, TROYZAN?

1157
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,359
YOU'RE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL!

1158
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,151
THE ONE PLACE YOU DO NOT WANT TO

1159
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,570
BE IN THIS GAME.

1160
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,365
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS

1161
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,159
EVERYONE GOT TOGETHER AND AGREED

1162
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,036
TO GIVE THE IMMUNITY TO THE

1163
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,204
GIRLS BECAUSE AS A TEAM WE

1164
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,165
WANTED TO VOTE BILL OUT.

1165
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,167
BUT LEIF BASICALLY SAID BILL

1166
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,586
WE'RE VOTING YOU OUT SO HE KIND

1167
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,213
OF BROKE THE TRUST OF EVERYBODY.

1168
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,673
IT WAS LIKE YOU JUST COMMITTED,

1169
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,383
LIKE, THE CARDINAL SIN TO US AND

1170
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:54,013
SO AS A GROUP WE SAID THAT CAN'T

1171
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:54,472
HAPPEN.

1172
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,098
YOU HAVE TO GO.

1173
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:55,932
Jeff: SO LEIF WAS A MEMBER

1174
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:56,557
OF YOUR ALLIANCE.

1175
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,725
YES.

1176
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,267
Jeff: HE WAS IN ON IT AND

1177
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,227
WENT AND BLURTED IT.

1178
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,978
YES.

1179
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:01,896
Jeff: SO LEIF YOU BLURT

1180
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,731
THIS OUT AND THEN ALL HELL RAINS

1181
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,399
DOWN ON YOU.

1182
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,484
YEAH, I'M DEFINITELY A GUY

1183
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,569
THAT JUST TRIES TO PLAY WITH MY

1184
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,864
HEART ON MY SLEEVE AND IT BIT ME

1185
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:12,448
IN THE BUTT.

1186
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,282
Jeff: PLAYING WITH YOUR

1187
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,743
HEART ON YOUR SLEEVE DOESN'T

1188
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,661
MEAN GIVING UP INFORMATION FROM

1189
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,328
AN ALLIANCE.

1190
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,122
WELL, I KNOW BILL AND I HAVE

1191
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,373
DEFINITELY BEEN GETTING CLOSER

1192
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,709
ON LIKE A MORE FRIEND LEVEL AND

1193
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,418
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

1194
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,422
I MEAN, HE ASKED AND I TOLD HIM.

1195
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,132
Jeff: AND YOU UNDERSTAND

1196
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,133
STRATEGICALLY HOW DANGEROUS THAT

1197
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:30,425
IS.

1198
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,134
YEAH.

1199
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,387
I MEAN RIGHT NOW I'M PRETTY MUCH

1200
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,471
GOING HOME.

1201
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,265
BUT BY PUTTING MYSELF UP FOR

1202
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,225
ELIMINATION I REALLY HOPE THAT

1203
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,394
IT PROVES TO THE GUYS THAT I

1204
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,898
STILL HAVE INTEGRITY WITHIN OUR

1205
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,482
GROUP.

1206
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,109
Jeff: JAY, WHY IS IT SO

1207
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,069
URGENT TO GIVE UP IMMUNITY?

1208
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,404
WHY NOT JUST SAY "ALL RIGHT,

1209
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,280
NEXT TIME WE HAVE TO VOTE

1210
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,407
SOMEBODY OUT, LEIF, IT'S YOU"?

1211
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,117
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST HEARD

1212
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,743
OF THIS IT WENT OVER MY HEAD

1213
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,327
LIKE ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING?

1214
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,621
WE DEMOLISHED OUR ENEMY AND YOU

1215
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,289
WANT TO HAND OVER THE IDOL.

1216
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,290
Jeff: BUT YOU SAID YES.

1217
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,292
I DID.

1218
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,127
IF I DON'T GO WITH THE MAJORITY

1219
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,128
I COULD BE THE NEXT ONE TO GO.

1220
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,464
I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT A TARGET

1221
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,174
ON MY BACK SO RELUCTANTLY, YES,

1222
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:11,758
I SAID YES.

1223
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,467
Jeff: BILL, WHAT ARE THE

1224
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,177
CHANCES THAT THIS WILL GO DOWN

1225
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,263
AS THE SINGLE DUMBEST MOVE EVER

1226
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,973
IN THIS GAME?

1227
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,266
DUMBER THAN SOMEBODY GIVING UP

1228
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,435
THEIR INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

1229
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,269
THIS IS A TRIBE!

1230
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,147
EIGHT PEOPLE AGREED TO DO THIS!

1231
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,191
I MEAN, THIS COULD BE THE

1232
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,443
SINGLE DUMBEST MOVE.

1233
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,487
I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL IT

1234
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,279
PLAYS OUT BUT THERE'S NO POINT

1235
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,157
IN GOING INTO A MERGE IF YOU

1236
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,119
HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T BE

1237
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:40,703
TRUSTED.

1238
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,287
Jeff: COLTON, WHERE DID

1239
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,538
THIS IDEA FIRST START?

1240
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,956
WHEN DID YOU HEAR ABOUT IT?

1241
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,042
WHEN WE REALIZED THAT LEIF

1242
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,668
HAD TOLD BILL, LIKE, I'M THE

1243
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,836
TYPE OF PERSON IN THIS GAME THAT

1244
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,337
IF I DON'T LIKE YOU I'M NOT

1245
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,297
GONNA TALK TO YOU.

1246
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,173
LIKE, I WILL JUST IGNORE YOU,

1247
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,341
LIKE LEAVE ME ALONE.

1248
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,300
Jeff: WHO DON'T YOU LIKE IN

1249
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,802
THIS GAME?

1250
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,677
BILL.

1251
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,596
(LAUGHS).

1252
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,722
Jeff: WHY DON'T YOU LIKE

1253
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,348
BILL?

1254
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,559
HE'S OBNOXIOUS, HE'S LOUD.

1255
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,020
AND, PLUS, HE'S A "STRUGGLING

1256
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,688
STANDUP COMIC."

1257
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,023
I DON'T GET WHAT YOUR

1258
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:09,565
CORRELATION IS.

1259
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,985
LIKE, GET A REAL JOB!

1260
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,028
Jeff: WOW, BILL.

1261
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,072
HONESTLY, I LOVE THE KID TO

1262
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:16,781
DEATH.

1263
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,157
WE JUST COME FROM TWO TOTALLY

1264
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:18,825
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.

1265
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,493
BUT THE THING ABOUT IT IS...

1266
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,537
WAIT, YOU JUST SPOKE.

1267
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,538
GIVE ME A SECOND.

1268
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,997
ME AND HIM COME FROM TWO

1269
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:25,706
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.

1270
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,415
I'M NOT HERE TRYING TO MAKE IT

1271
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,502
THIS WHOLE BLACK WHITE THING OR

1272
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,127
WHATEVER.

1273
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:30,878
I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE

1274
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,420
DIFFERENCES IN OUR UPBRINGINGS,

1275
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,256
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1276
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,423
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN SINCE I WAS

1277
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,509
17 YEARS OLD, MAN.

1278
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,177
ME BEING POOR, THAT'S JUST MY

1279
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:38,886
LIFE.

1280
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,179
WHEN YOU'RE A STRUGGLING STAND

1281
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,264
UP COMIC, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

1282
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,557
YOU DON'T MAKE VERY MUCH MONEY,

1283
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,933
YOU SLEEP ON PEOPLE'S COUCHES

1284
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,393
AND YOU GO FROM GIG TO GIG.

1285
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,228
THE TRUTH IS, THAT'S WHAT I DO.

1286
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,522
Jeff: SO COLTON, TELL ME

1287
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,857
ABOUT WHERE YOU COME FROM.

1288
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,566
ALABAMA.

1289
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,111
I MEAN, I LIVE A TOWN OF 3,000

1290
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:55,820
PEOPLE.

1291
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,572
AND, YES, I DID GO TO A PRIVATE,

1292
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,364
LIKE, ALL-WHITE SCHOOL.

1293
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,283
BUT I DO HAVE, LIKE, AFRICAN

1294
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,493
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.

1295
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,620
Jeff: WHO?

1296
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,956
(LAUGHS)

1297
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,249
MY HOUSEKEEPER!

1298
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,876
SO, I MEAN, LIKE, THAT JUST

1299
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,587
PUT US ON A WEIRD VIBE FROM DAY

1300
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,254
ONE.

1301
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,964
BUT SHE'S, LIKE, A MEMBER OF

1302
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,924
OUR FAMILY.

1303
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,592
Jeff: A PAID MEMBER.

1304
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,342
YES.

1305
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,760
I MEAN, YOU KNOW... SHE DOESN'T

1306
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,012
WORK FOR FREE.

1307
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:21,721
BUT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

1308
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,432
BILL BECAUSE OF HIS RACE AT ALL.

1309
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,767
THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH BILL IS

1310
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,145
THAT HE'S POOR PITIFUL ME I'M

1311
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:29,812
POOR.

1312
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,771
LIKE, I DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH

1313
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,772
PEOPLE LIKE THAT IN THE REAL

1314
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,481
WORLD AND I'M SURE AS HELL NOT

1315
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,274
GOING TO ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE

1316
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,109
LIKE THAT OUT HERE.

1317
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,444
Jeff: SO BEING A STANDUP IS

1318
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,987
NOT A LEGITIMATE PROFESSION IN

1319
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,571
YOUR EYES?

1320
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,239
NO, IT IS A LEGITIMATE

1321
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,283
PROFESSION BUT HAVING A BACKUP

1322
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:42,825
PLAN.

1323
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,618
LIKE, DON'T LIVE OFF THE

1324
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,619
KINDNESS OF OTHERS.

1325
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,202
Jeff: .

1326
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,788
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

1327
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,457
BRO, YOU HAVEN'T WORKED AN

1328
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,416
HONEST DAY IN YOUR LIFE OR HAD

1329
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,002
TO ACTUALLY GO OUT AND GET A

1330
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:53,753
JOB.

1331
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,629
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT UP HERE AND

1332
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,963
TELL ME THAT ME PURSUING MY

1333
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,964
DREAM, SOMETHING THAT I LOVE,

1334
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,466
WHICH IS COMEDY, I DON'T WANT A

1335
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,133
FALLBACK PLAN.

1336
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:01,469
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY

1337
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:01,802
LIFE.

1338
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,595
OKAY...

1339
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,846
HOLD ON.

1340
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,472
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY

1341
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:04,972
LIFE.

1342
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:05,473
DON'T JUDGE ME.

1343
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,141
I DON'T JUDGE YOU.

1344
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,684
SO DON'T LOOK DOWN AT ME.

1345
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,477
DON'T CALL ME NAMES.

1346
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,855
AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD I WORK

1347
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,690
WITH PEOPLE AND FOR NO ONE.

1348
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,525
YOU GOT THAT?

1349
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,819
WHATEVER, BILL.

1350
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,780
Jeff: KOHL ON THE, ARE

1351
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,949
THERE ANY GROUPS WHERE YOU LIVE

1352
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,159
THAT LOOK DOWN OR MAYBE JUDGE

1353
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:25,660
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GAY?

1354
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,452
I'M SURE THERE ARE.

1355
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,496
BUT THE PEOPLE THAT I ASSOCIATE

1356
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,539
WITH, YEAH, Y'ALL CAN SAY

1357
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,541
COUNTRY CLUB PEOPLE, WHATEVER, I

1358
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,001
FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MORE

1359
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,169
EDUCATED THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AND

1360
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,504
THEY'RE MORE OPEN AND ACCEPTING

1361
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,213
TO THINGS.

1362
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,339
THE ONES WHO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

1363
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,382
IT ARE THE ONES RIDING AROUND IN

1364
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,717
THEIR, LIKE, JACKED UP CHUCKS

1365
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,385
WITH THE REBEL FLAGS HANGING IN

1366
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,470
THE BACK AND THEY GO HOME TO

1367
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:51,185
THEIR TRAILERS AT NIGHT.

1368
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,186
Jeff: TARZAN?

1369
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,438
ALL I WANT TO SAY IS THIS

1370
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,899
CONVERSATION HAS DEVOLVEED INTO

1371
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,277
A NUMBER OF SOCIAL PLATITUDES

1372
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,612
UNFAIR TO BOTH GUYS AND AS FAR

1373
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,446
AS I CAN TELL COLTON'S BEEN

1374
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,449
PAINTED IN THE WRONG LIGHT,

1375
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,701
WHICH IS EASY ENOUGH TO DO.

1376
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,910
Jeff: WHAT LIGHT IS THAT?

1377
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,204
WELL, HE'S BEEN PAINTED AS A

1378
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,580
RICH KID THAT NEVER HAD TO LIFT

1379
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,164
A FINGER AND...

1380
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,541
Jeff: PAINTED BY WHO?

1381
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,458
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

1382
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,377
THE WHOLE THING ABOUT RACE IRKS

1383
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,003
ME.

1384
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,172
I THINK IT'S TIME TO QUIT

1385
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,425
TALKING ABOUT (BLEEP)ING RACES.

1386
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,260
I'M FED UP WITH PEOPLE TALKING

1387
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:24,927
ABOUT RACE!

1388
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:25,886
I'M TIRED OF IT!

1389
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,722
I WANT PEOPLE TO BASE WHAT THEY

1390
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,557
THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY ON HOW THEY

1391
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,392
BEHAVE AND WHAT THEIR MERITS ARE

1392
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,059
AND NOTHING ELSE.

1393
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,394
I DON'T CARE WHAT COLOR THEY

1394
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,061
ARE.

1395
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,396
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE SHOULD DO.

1396
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:35,980
AND I THINK THIS COUNTRY IS

1397
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,440
MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION.

1398
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:44,238
WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT!

1399
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,699
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

1400
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,200
Jeff: IT'S VERY INTERESTING

1401
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,077
WHAT'S DEVELOPED HERE TONIGHT.

1402
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,287
THE DIFFERENCES THAT YOU GUYS

1403
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,496
BRING INTO THIS GAME ARE A VERY

1404
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,957
BIG PART OF WHAT WILL EITHER GET

1405
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,417
YOU TO THE END OR END UP GETTING

1406
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,210
YOU VOTED OUT AS IS GOING TO BE

1407
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,420
THE CASE TONIGHT.

1408
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,714
YOU TWO MAY NEVER HAVE MET IN

1409
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,548
NORMAL LIFE.

1410
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,258
NEVER.

1411
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,801
BUT YOU'RE HERE TODAY AND THE

1412
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,595
ONLY WAY TO GET TO THE END IS

1413
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,554
EITHER WITH EACH OTHER OR

1414
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,932
THROUGH THE OTHER.

1415
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,476
AND REGARDLESS HOW THIS VOTE

1416
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,935
COMES OUT, THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL

1417
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,479
WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE

1418
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,439
CRAZIEST IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

1419
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:18,981
GAME.

1420
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,233
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1421
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:31,285
JAY, YOU'RE UP.

1422
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:41,462
JAY, YOU'RE UP.

1423
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,255
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

1424
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,007
I'M NEVER GONNA LIKE YOU SO

1425
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:55,101
PLEASE TAKE YOUR BROKE ASS HOME.

1426
00:39:55,184 --> 00:40:01,357
PLEASE TAKE YOUR BROKE ASS HOME.

1427
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,608
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1428
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:11,867
VOTES.

1429
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,660
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1430
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,661

00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,621

1432
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,791

OKAY.

1434
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,793
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1436
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,337
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1437
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,713
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1438
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,256
IMMEDIATELY.

1439
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,800
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1440
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:31,679

00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:07,840
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1452
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,051
BILL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1453
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:20,895
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,272
WELL, VOLUNTARILY GIVING UP

1455
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:23,981
IMMUNITY WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF

1456

THE BIGGEST AND RISKIEST MOVES

1457
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,693
EVER SEEN IN THIS GAME.

1458
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,569
TIME WILL TELL IF THIS ONE PAYS

1459
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,278
OFF.

1460
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,613
GRAB YOUR TORCH, LET'S HEAD BACK

1461
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,405

1462
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:36,911

CONTINUES.

1473
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,262
BLAH WHAT'S THE PLAN?

1474
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,764
I COULD BE COLTON'S BITCH, I'LL

1478

1480
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:03,812
OH, MY GOD!

1481
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:10,694
I JUST THOUGHT BEEP!

1482
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:14,281
MY TRIBE IS DOING SOME VERY

1483
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:14,949
UNORTHODOX THINGS.

1484
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,283
BUT SINCE I WAS PROBABLY NEXT ON

1485
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,952
THE CHOPPING BLOCK ANYWAY, I

1486
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,787
CAME TO TRIBAL COUNCIL TO ROLL

1487
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,746
THE DICE.

1488
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,498
ONE DAY COLTON WILL BE PUT IN A

1489
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,499
SITUATION WHERE HE CAN'T JUST

1490
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,750
NOT LIKE SOMEBODY BECAUSE

1491
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,918
THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT HE'S

1492
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,920
USED TO OR THAT HE'S GROWN UP

1493
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:28,545

1494
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,630
HE JUDGED ME BECAUSE OF MY
