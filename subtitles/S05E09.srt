JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>Chuay Gahn and Sook Jai</i>
<i>struggled</i>

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,757

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,259
BRIAN:<i> When I look at Sook Jai,</i>
<i>I see enemy.</i>

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,637
<i>I can't just, all of a sudden,</i>
<i>"Oh, great, one happy family."</i>

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,264
It's not gonna happen.
They're gonna have to earn that.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,141
KEN:<i> There's definitely</i>
<i>a strategic reason to get along</i>

8
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>with these people, because</i>

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,601
things change real quick.

PROBST:
<i>The immunity challenge</i>

11
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>became a showdown</i>
<i>between Brian and Jake.</i>

12
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,109
The only way Sook Jai can win
is if Jake

13
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,695
stays under the water
longer than Brian.

14
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>But Jake gave up too soon,</i>

15
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,323

<i>their victory.</i>

16
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,950
Chuay Gahn wins immunity.

18
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,163
<i>Back at camp,</i>

20
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,294

Do we want to go ahead

I said, well, I wonder
what he's looking at,

so I started sneaking over
to where he was,

147
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,096

was a little six-point buck.

an old adventurer.

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,876
All of a sudden, he looked
up at me, just straight at me

160
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,672

open chest and neck shot

Grab your rip cord!"

168
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,692

Oh, my gosh.

170
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,196
And I hit that ground
and just--

171
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,906
My ankle went ka-bap!

172

Uh, I would imagine that's
some type of FAA violation.

I've had both my ankles
broken twice, see.

178

Welcome.

205
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,342
Well, when you started

206
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,970
this thing, you probably made
a few assumptions.

207
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,138
One of which I'm sure is,

208
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,807
"Damn sure going to
miss my loved ones."

209
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,642
Well, before you jump to
any other assumptions,

210
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,853
your loved ones are not
anywhere on the island.

211
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,981
But I did ask them to send you

212
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,150
a little love
via a video from home.

213
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,986
He's lying.

214
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,070
That's what we have here.

I love you, sweetie.

I love you

Nice little reminder of
what's at home, huh, Jake?

Certainly is.

remind you of how special
that relationship is?

307
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,084
It definitely does.

And coming out here,

309
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,380
um, one thing
I've really learned

310
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,008
from talking with everyone
is how much in love

311
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,844
everyone is
with their loved one.

312
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,803
And it makes me--

313
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,306
you know, when I get married
and want to be

314
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,101
just this awesome wife,

going to go home and be

Tell us about the new changes
in your life.

321
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,533
Well, I recently had a daughter.

322
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,913
She was born a couple days
before actually coming out here,

323
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,998
and she had to stay
in the hospital an extra day.

324
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:15,419
And that last day was the day
that I was actually leaving.

325
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,505
Well, here's your wife,
your daughter.

326
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,547
You're crazy.

a little bit
of each other's families.

339
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,694
Well, the reward
for today's challenge is

340
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,448
one person gets to watch
their entire video,

341
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,368
while enjoying
a nice, cool beverage.

342
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,620
Now you'd assume that would mean
that this will be

343
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,332
an individual challenge, which
would mean that you've merged.

344
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,085
You're probably assuming
these gold buffs

345
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,379
are for your new tribe?

346
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,881
Finally, an assumption
that's right.

347
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,132
-Wow.
-Sook Jai

348
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,386
-and Chuay Gahn are no more.
-Whoo! -Thank you.

349
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,096
The eight of you
are now one tribe

350
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:07,930
from here to the end.

351
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,099
Wow.

352
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,644
You'll have a flag and paints
waiting for you back at camp.

353
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,938
With 14 days left,
this is a new start.

354
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,439
(exhales)

355
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,109
Thank you.
Thank God, yes.

356
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,986
PROBST: The first part
of today's challenge is

357
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,613
<i>an obstacle course.</i>

358
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,783
<i>You're going to run it in pairs</i>
<i>that'll be chosen at random.</i>

359
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,617
It's going to be the first time

360
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,786
some of you
have competed together.

361
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,955
<i>The goal is</i>
<i>to get one wicker ball</i>

362
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,456
<i>from one end of the course</i>
<i>to the other.</i>

363
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,749
<i>You're going to</i>
<i>climb up a ladder,</i>

364
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,794
<i>you'll grab a machete,</i>
<i>which is wrapped in burlap,</i>

365
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,297
<i>you'll use the machete</i>
<i>to chop through a log,</i>

366
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,465
<i>and then the log</i>
<i>will release the wicker ball.</i>

367
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,635
<i>You'll then move the wicker</i>
<i>ball through a fishnet tube,</i>

368
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,638
<i>over and under a series</i>
<i>of horizontal ladders,</i>

369
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,474
<i>and then you'll climb</i>
<i>up and over a cargo net.</i>

370
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,268
<i>Then you'll head to</i>
<i>the finish line, where you will</i>

371
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,812
<i>place your ball</i>
<i>on top of a pyramid.</i>

372
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,147
The winning pair
will then compete

373
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,442
against each other
in the final mental challenge.

374
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,861
Switch out your buffs;
we got a challenge to run.

375
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,197
Okay, we've randomly
selected our pairs.

376
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,368
First up, Jake and Jan
taking on Clay and Ken.

377
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,494
This is the first heat.

378
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,704
Winner moves on
to the next heat.

379
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,789
-Survivors ready?
-JAN: Yes.

380
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,041
Go!

381
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,766
Guys are making good progress.

382
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,104
Clay's released his ball.

383
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,398
Ken and Clay
are off and running.

384
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,861
Right on it.

385
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,071
There it is.

386
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,741
Jan and Jake are right behind.

387
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,664
Jake and Jan gaining ground.

388
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,928
Clay and Ken are
moving on to the cargo net.

389
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,262
Don't lose that ball.

390
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,030
Clay and Ken moving on
to the next round.

391
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,741
Next up, Ted and Penny
taking on Brian and Helen.

392
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,742
Heat number two.

393
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,411
Winners move on
to the next round.

394
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,578
Survivors ready?

395
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,246
Go!

396
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:47,256
Big Ted starting in on the log
like a madman!

397
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,342
Brian and Helen
have their wicker ball.

398
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,513
Penny and big Ted
are right behind them.

399
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,144
Brian and Helen moving on
to the cargo net.

400
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,774
Penny and Ted falling behind.

401
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,320
JAN:
Good job, good job.

402
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,240
Brian and Helen moving on
to the next round!

403
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,826
You'll take on Clay and Ken.

404
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,037
Winner of this heat moves
to the final round,

405
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,290
where you will take on
your partner.

406
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,416
Survivors ready?

407
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,709
Go!

408
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,633
Clay and Ken make quick work.

409
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,970
Brian and Helen
are right behind.

410
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,142
Helen is working that fishnet.

411
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,270
Brian and Helen moving on
to the cargo net.

412
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,068
Helen and Brian win.

413
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,279
Brian and Helen,
you've reached the finale.

414
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,322
Here's how it works.

415
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,783
There are 20 wicker balls.

416
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,328
<i>They're made up into seven</i>
<i>pieces that make up a pyramid.</i>

417
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,497
Your goal:
use those wicker balls

418
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,999
to replicate the pyramid
in front of you.

419
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,709
Survivors ready?

420
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,169
Go!

421
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:07,836
PENNY:
Come on, guys.

422
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,296
-Let's go, let's go.
-Go.

423
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,498
PROBST:
Brian's got it!

424
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,374
-Good job.
-Ready for something to drink?

425
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,418
-Good job!
-Watch a little video?

426
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,379
Let's go, everybody.

427
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,214
Take a look at Brian's video.

428
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,382
-Right on.
-Let's head out, guys.

429
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,383
Let's go.

430
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,759
Great, Brian!

431
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,760
Good job, Bri!

432
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,220
-Brian.
-Thank you.

433
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,388
You can have the honor,
since it is your reward.

434
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,807
One glass, one pitcher.

435
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,725
You got it.
<i>Salud,</i> everybody.

436
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,061
<i>-Salud.</i> -I'm gonna...
I'm gonna pass it around.

437
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:09,398
While you guys drink,
got your name on it.

438
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,440
Oh. Hey.

439
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,068
If my wife does anything
embarrassing, I apologize.

440
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:13,777
She's a little crazy.
(chuckles)

441
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,073
Hey, honey! Congratulations.

442
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,742
I guess you won...
whatever,

443
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,244
because you're watching
this tape.

444
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:22,661
Say hey, Logan.

445
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,538
"Hey, Daddy!"

446
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,373
Say hello. Boop-boop.
Look at the camera.

447
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,374
Say, "Hello, Daddy!"

448
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,418
I miss you. I love you.

449
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,754
Also, I've been
getting in shape.

450
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,256
Look at those muscles, yeah!

451
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,259
(chuckles) Logey and I,
we're going to party.

452
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,635
Now that you're gone,
we're going to party.

453
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,095
See, I told you.
What'd I tell y'all?

454
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,430
So Logey and I are
going to go downstairs

455
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,098
and we're going to go dance.

456
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,433
(music playing)

457
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,601
Logan's like, "What the..."

458
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,351
He's like,
"What's Mommy doing?"

459
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,230
HELEN:
He's liking it, though.

460
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,315
BRIAN:
Oh, my gosh, that's too funny.

461
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,818
CLAY:<i> She's a fox,</i>
<i>I'm going to tell you.</i>

462
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,486
<i>She's a fine-looking woman,</i>
<i>and, uh...</i>

463
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,406
Buddy, she's-she's fit for the
bikinis, I'm going to tell you.

464
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,409
BRIAN: Sorry if she gets
a little crazy here.

465
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,620
(laughs)
That's okay.

466
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,622
BRIAN:<i> She kept her clothes on,</i>
<i>which I was happy about,</i>

467
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,165
<i>but, uh, I didn't want everyone</i>

468
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,666
to know more about me
than they should.

469
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,085
It's almost one of
those things where, uh,

470
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,879
<i>I didn't think it was necessary</i>
<i>for them to see my family.</i>

471
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,465
The house is a real mess.

472
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,383
-Why don't you clean up?
-I'll show it to you, anyway.

473
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,301
Is this kind of weird,
seeing your house?

474
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,637
Yeah, it's really weird.

475
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,141
And here's your lovely piano
that we miss you playing.

476
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:29,645
(playing discordant notes)

477
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,520
There's the beater.

478
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,522
There's your car.

479
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,609
The Caddy, Caddy, Caddy.

480
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,735
HELEN:<i> With the nice</i>
<i>two brand-new cars</i>

481
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,321
<i>in the garage</i>
<i>and the baby grand piano,</i>

482
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,617
it looks like Brian's doing
pretty damn good for himself.

483
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,993
<i>If I were against Brian</i>
<i>right now,</i>

484
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,829
<i>that'd be enough to vote him</i>
<i>off, because I'd be going,</i>

485
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,706
<i>"This guy doesn't</i>
<i>need the money."</i>

486
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,626
We want you to come home soon,
and we want you to win

487
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,797
the million dollars
so that we can all go to Fiji.

488
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,966
Love you.

489
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,509
Bye.
(smooching)

490
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,146
JAN:
"Chuay Jai."

491
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,023
Underneath that, "Survivor 5."

492
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,859
Then the rest of the goal
is going to have each person

493
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,903
with their hand
on the top and the bottom.

494
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,571
That'd be real neat,
to put all of our handprints.

495
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,865
CLAY:
<i>We had a little challenge,</i>

496
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,409
<i>and, uh, found out</i>
<i>we was all one tribe.</i>

497
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,536
<i>And now is when</i>
<i>the game's gonna start,</i>

498
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,745
<i>'cause I'm gonna tell you what.</i>

499
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,539
Hell, I'm here to win
a million dollars.

500
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,374
To outplay, outwit and outlast.

501
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,917
-KEN: Clay.
-Huh?

502
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,877
-You said you wanted to put
our handprints on it? -Yeah.

503
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,338
JAN:
Oh, that's great.

504
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,589
That looks great.

505
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,926
My main concern was getting to
this point to where now we have

506
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,053
individual challenges,
and it could help me.

507
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,556
<i>I'm going to be a viable threat</i>
<i>for that immunity</i>

508
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,891
<i>every time it comes around.</i>

509
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,351
-TED: Oh.
-Got it.

510
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,686
-Good deal.
-That is good.

511
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,603
Okay, who's next?

512
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,897
BRIAN:
<i>We've now come to a merger,</i>

513
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,567
<i>which is a crossroads,</i>
<i>and it's a new game.</i>

514
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,571
<i>You've got two former enemies</i>
<i>that are now sleeping together.</i>

515
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,032
<i>But right now it doesn't matter</i>

516
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,616
whether it was
somebody from my tribe

517
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,243
or somebody
from the other tribe.

518
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,578
<i>Whoever's getting on</i>
<i>someone's nerves,</i>

519
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,580
<i>that's pretty much</i>
<i>how the vote's going to go.</i>

520
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,665
PENNY: You know what?
That refried bean dip

521
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,752
with cream cheese, there's sour
cream in there, too.

522
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,211
-HELEN: There... Okay, I was
wondering. -I forgot.

523
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,796
'Cause it was sounding really
thick to me, but... -Yeah.

524
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,758
-I thought
about that last night. -Okay.

525
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,136
TED:<i> Helen would be talking</i>
<i>about recipes and food,</i>

526
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,929
<i>and those things were</i>
<i>really, really, really</i>

527
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,098
<i>starting to bother me.</i>

528
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,558
KEN:
Are you sleeping, Ted?

529
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,560
Just, uh, resting the eyes.

530
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,604
TED:<i> I felt myself,</i>
<i>little small things</i>

531
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,606
starting to get on my nerve.

532
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,608
<i>You know, I was feeling</i>

533
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,110
<i>grumpier and grumpier</i>
<i>and grumpier.</i>

534
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,654
So, wh-what do you put-- what's
in that sauce, to flavor yours?

535
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,698
JAN:
It's got Worcester, soy sauce...

536
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,077
TED:<i> I internalized all of that,</i>
<i>and I said, um, it's time.</i>

537
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,081
<i>It's time for me to get away</i>
<i>and to get some me time.</i>

538
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,506
<i>It was some real good</i>
<i>quality me time.</i>

539
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:07,094
<i>I think the reason why a lot of</i>
<i>people don't take the me time</i>

540
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,637
<i>is because</i>
<i>they don't want to be</i>

541
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,807
perceived as a loner or

542
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,643
<i>somebody out there,</i>
<i>not a part of the team,</i>

543
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,103
<i>that type of thing.</i>

544
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,980
<i>I honestly am taking a risk</i>
<i>by doing that.</i>

545
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,986
Ted just went off on the canoe.

546
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,946
He didn't tell anyone.

547
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,491
He probably didn't mean
to go out that far.

548
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,326
Probably just needed
to get away, you know.

549
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,036
PENNY:
<i>I think Ted kind of</i>

550
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,579
<i>goes off and does</i>
<i>his own thing sometimes,</i>

551
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,666
<i>and sometimes I don't think</i>
<i>he fits in with the group</i>

552
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,670
maybe as well as
he may think that he does.

553
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,171
Ted is not that fast, I mean...

554
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,172
No.

555
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,174
-He can't swim at all.
-He can't swim worth--

556
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:46,508
He's not--
he's too big to run.

557
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,801
Mm-hmm.

me off. -You gotta be real...

560
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,975
-It's his way or the highway.
-Ted doesn't like...

561
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,061
Ted doesn't, you know--
he ain't got a clue.

the littlest things tick people
off or get under someone's skin,

564
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,236
<i>which is so interesting to me,</i>
<i>how such a small, minute thing</i>

565
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,529

566
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,948

down the road.

00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,200
We're just trying to get him--
we got to get him on the jury.

568
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,743
That'll secure me and you

569
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,744
-immunity all the way in.
-Okay.

570
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,955

BRIAN:<i> With regards to</i>
<i>my alliance with Ted,</i>

00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,542
<i>I think that once it does</i>
<i>get down to either him or me,</i>

573
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,668
obviously I'm going to be

574
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,837
looking after
good old number one.

575
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,173
I-I think if we just
play it a little bit cool

576
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,508
and just march
right on in there,

577
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,552
that would secure us
all the way to the top two.

578
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,053
Okay, yeah.

579
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,638
(sighs)

580
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,729

<i>somebody that will get on</i>

582
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,901
And I don't know who I can trust
on the other team.

583
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,527
That's the problem.

584
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,739
Ted-- everybody's tired of Ted,
getting tired of Ted, so...

585
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,823
They like him,
they love him to death,

586
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:56,703
but just his attitude
is, uh, getting pretty old.

587
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,246
So, in your estimation,

588
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,540
that's probably
who you'd go for first?

589
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,417
If it was right now, yeah.

590
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,711

<i>I got a sense that they're all</i>

00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,423
He said that's probably
who they'd vote off

593
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,091
if they had to vote today.

594
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,761
At first, I would've
definitely said, uh, Ken,

595
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,930
but then everybody telling you,
"He's a pretty good ol' guy.

596
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,264
He's a pretty good ol' guy."

cooking right now, we can...

602
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,611
we can handle this thing
kind of systematically.

603
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:29,736
Yeah.

604
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,742
Right now, it's Ted.

605
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,743
Oh.

00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,787
Right now, it's...
it's Ted to go first.

607
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,288
Oh, yeah?

TED:
How you doing, Jeff?

613
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,139
JAN (giggles):
Hi.

614
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,349
PROBST:
Welcome, guys.

615
00:25:59,432 --> 00:25:59,933
First things first.

616
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,851
Ah, hate to give her up.

617
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,145
Yep.
Immunity is back up for grabs,

618
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,316
but because you guys are now one
tribe, tribal immunity no more.

619
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,317
Mm-hmm.

620
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,987
This is what you now covet.

621
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,029
The immunity necklace.

622
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,950
Wear this,
you cannot be voted out.

623
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:20,161
Today's challenge
will be played in two rounds.

624
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,163
The first is a simple
elimination round

625
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,291
that will test your memory.

626
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,001
The second round will be a final

627
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,836
<i>showdown race</i>
<i>on the course behind me.</i>

628
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,713
For the first round,
I will show you a grid.

629
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,841
On the grid will be the numbers
one through nine in English

630
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,094
and the numbers
one through nine in Thai.

631
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,178
I'll give you 30 seconds

632
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,391
to study the grid
and memorize the Thai numbers.

633
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,519
Miss one number
and you're out of the game.

634
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,313
Take a seat.
Grab the colored cards

635
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,315
that have the Thai numbers
on them.

636
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,733
I'm going to say
a number in English,

637
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,569
you show me that same number
in Thai.

638
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,364
All right, look closely.

639
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,825
You got 30 seconds
to memorize these.

640
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,832
All right.

641
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,875
Grab your stack, stand up.

642
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,253
Show me the number nine.

643
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,757
Ken, you're right.

644
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,259
Jake, you're not.

645
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,886
Have a seat.

646
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,054
Clay, you're right.

647
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,555
Helen, you're not.

648
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,556
Have a seat.

649
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,099
Penny, you're right.

650
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:23,892
Jan, you're wrong.
Have a seat.

651
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,894
Ted, that is not right.

652
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,896
Have a seat.

653
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,022
Brian, that is not right.

654
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,023
Have a seat.

655
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,858
We're down to three.

656
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,736
Only two of you
will move to the next round.

657
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,113
Show me the number one.

658
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,329
That is correct.

659
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,415
-That is also correct.
-Yeah!

660
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,249
I knew it was.

661
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,751
Penny, you need to
get this right.

662
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,794
Miss it, you're out.

663
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,422
That is wrong.

664
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,924
Clay and Ken moving on
to the final round.

665
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:01,721
This will determine who wins
the first individual immunity.

666
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,599
<i>All right, this one's</i>
<i>a little more complicated.</i>

667
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,395
<i>We have a series of sandy</i>
<i>mounds laid out on a grid.</i>

668
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,273
<i>Buried inside those mounds</i>
<i>are ten disks for each of you.</i>

669
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,026
<i>There are instructions on these</i>
<i>disks that will navigate you</i>

670
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,572
<i>through the grid, from</i>
<i>one buried disk to the next.</i>

671
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,865
The first symbol
represents a number.

672
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,786
This is the number of
sandy mounds you will travel.

673
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,956
Second symbol is a direction--
east, west, north, south.

674
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,958
This is the direction
you will travel in.

675
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,086
<i>If you misread</i>
<i>the instructions,</i>

676
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,754
<i>you'll uncover a red disk.</i>

677
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,339
<i>That means</i>
<i>you got to try again.</i>

678
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,966
<i>If you get it right,</i>
<i>you'll uncover</i>

679
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,008
<i>the next set of instructions,</i>

680
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,928
<i>which will also have</i>
<i>a tally card.</i>

681
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,765
<i>Tear off the tally card,</i>
<i>hang it on your tally board.</i>

682
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,310
First person with their ten
tally cards on their tally board

683
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,646
wins immunity--
safe from the vote.

684
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,189
-Ready to run it?
-Yep.

685
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,858
Take a spot, wait for my go.

686
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,320
<i>Compass right here;</i>
<i>you can reference it anytime.</i>

687
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,157
<i>And always remember,</i>
<i>the water is west.</i>

688
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,159
Here we go, guys, for immunity.

689
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,493
-Survivors ready?
-Ready.

690
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,494
Go!

691
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,163
JAN:
Go, guys!

692
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,512
One, two.

693
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,014
East.

694
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,057
One, two.

695
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,895
(whispers):
Two...

696
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,486
PROBST:
Clay found his first one.

697
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,487
JAN:
Good job.

698
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,200
PROBST:
No, Ken, try again.

699
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,416
Clay has his second one.

700
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,251
JAN:
Way to go, Clay!

701
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,010
(mutters):
Okay, one.

702
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,471
East.

703
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:10,975
PROBST:
Clay has his third disk.

704
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,103
Ken has his first one.

705
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,063
JAN:
Way to go, Ken!

706
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,190
Good job, Ken.

707
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,739
PROBST:
Clay has his fourth disk.

708
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,741
Clay has his fifth disk.

709
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,037
Clay has his sixth disk.

710
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,747
Ken has his second.

711
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,124
Clay has his seventh disk.

712
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,043
Clay has seven.

713
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,713
Ken has two.

714
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,675
Ken, wrong again.

715
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,517
Clay has his ninth disk.

716
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,104
Ken has his third disk.

717
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,772
One more, Clay,
and you win immunity.

718
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:00,108
Clay has his tenth disk!

719
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,236
-Yeah! Yeah!
-(onlookers cheering)

720
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,280
-JAN: Way to go, Clay! Yay!
-Yeah!

721
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,075
-Clay wins immunity!
-Yeah! -(cheering)

722
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,952
Yeah!

723
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,412
Congratulations.

724
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,746
Thank you.

725
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,582
-Way to go, Clay!
-PROBST: Get over here, Clay.

726
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,083
I know I look sexy, baby!

727
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,669
I know I look sexy!

728
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,962
-Pretty good!
-It's me, baby.

729
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,171
Clay, safe from
the vote tonight.

730
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,301
At a one-in-eight game,
very important.

731
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,010
The other seven,
everybody's vulnerable tonight.

732
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,263
You guys can head back to camp.

733
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,640
-I'll see you at Tribal.
-Thank you.

734
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,111
Good job, guys.

735
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,487
Y'all did a good job.

736
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,031
-Congratulations, man.
-Thank you, thank you.

737
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,158
-Congratulations. -I don't want
anybody to be jealous or

738
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,827
anything, but I plan on keeping
this thing a long, long time.

739
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,662
-That's fine, that's fine.
-TED: It's all good, baby.

740
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,955
Clay, you did good.

741
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:56,998
-Thank you, sir.
-You done good.

742
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:57,999
Thank you, sir.

743
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,667
JAKE:
You really did great.

744
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,170
TED:<i> Today, we had our first</i>
<i>individual immunity challenge.</i>

745
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,173
<i>And the fact that</i>
<i>NYC was in the finals</i>

746
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,344
<i>basically showed</i>
<i>his strength today.</i>

747
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,137
So our strategy now is to
let's go ahead and eliminate

748
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,849
the strength or the potential
strength of Sook Jai.

749
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,810
They've been worried since
square one that I was a threat.

750
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:22,357
And they didn't want to have to
compete against me for immunity.

751
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,275
So I don't think
they're going to take Ted.

752
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,403
It's not in their best interest
to do that, and they know it.

753
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,780
So they're not going to.

754
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,199
We got to create
a little bit of stir.

755
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,825
-Shake up the chicken coop?
-We got to create...

756
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,827
We got to create
some doubt here.

757
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,872
Basically, we got to bring
one over, or we're screwed.

758
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:40,208
Yeah. Now, who can you
bring over?

759
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,002
I think what I'm going to do
is tell Clay he ain't got

760
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,755
a chance of winning
against Brian.

761
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,882
(chuckles)

762
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,384
We ought to get rid of him.

763
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,885
JAKE:
<i>The plan is pretty simple.</i>

764
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:54,347
We get rid of Brian,
and we get rid of Brian tonight.

765
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,851
<i>Brian's a class act.</i>

766
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,689
<i>So the idea is to get rid of</i>
<i>a real strong person.</i>

767
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,733
<i>But the way we do it</i>
<i>is, I use my team members--</i>

768
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,737
<i>there's three strong--</i>
<i>to vote for Brian.</i>

769
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,533
<i>And Clay brings in</i>
<i>one other person with him,</i>

770
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,077
and we vote Brian out,
just that quick.

771
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,872
My plan calls for you to be able
to handle one of the ladies.

772
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,415
Can you handle one of them?

773
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,290
-Oh, yeah.
-Can you?

774
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,291
Oh, easy.

775
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,252
And then we-we can
move into the...

776
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,587
-Top two?
-Mm-hmm.

777
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,758
It's-It's a pretty good plan
for moving us there.

778
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,301
It's-It's a great plan for you.

779
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,762
Mm-hmm. I'll take anything--
they trust me.

780
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,264
CLAY:<i> Jake's trying to get me</i>
<i>to work out a deal where</i>

781
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,558
<i>he's wanting me</i>
<i>to kick Brian off</i>

782
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,059
<i>and he's got it</i>
<i>all figured out.</i>

783
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,102
We'll see what happens.

784
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,771
Jake is out for Jake,
and Clay's out for Clay.

785
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,983
If we did that and voted
Brian off, it be three.

786
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,943
That's what I'm thinking.

787
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,778
I mean, that's in Clay's
best interest,

788
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,572
but he's not going to
see it like that.

789
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,073
I don't know.

790
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,075
KEN:<i> Jake has</i>
<i>an alternative plan,</i>

791
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,618
<i>trying to work</i>
<i>a deal with Clay.</i>

792
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,161
It would actually be
in Clay's best interest,

793
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,663
but whether or not

794
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,583
<i>Clay sees it like that is going</i>
<i>to be a different story.</i>

795
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,167
Have you heard anything?

796
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,335
No.

797
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,921
I say just, uh, vote for Ted,
like they said.

798
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,799
They said they were
getting rid of him, so, uh,

799
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,509
just vote for him
and hope for the best.

800
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,969
That's all I can do.

801
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:17,346
KEN:<i> Chuay Gahn is saying that</i>
<i>they're going to vote Ted out.</i>

802
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,474
If that's the possibility,
it might keep me afloat,

803
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,100
I-I'll throw a throw a vote
that way.

804
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,603
God, I hate this cleavage
leaking out

805
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,813
in front of everybody,
but that's okay.

806
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,983
-Really got us all turned on.
-I know it, I know.

807
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,610
BRIAN:<i> Now it's the, uh,</i>
<i>fourth quarter basically.</i>

808
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,820
<i>We're getting into</i>
<i>the long stretch.</i>

809
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,447
<i>Everything counts.</i>

810
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,658
<i>Friends count, uh,</i>
<i>relationships count.</i>

811
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,703
The littlest things are gonna
either, uh, make you or break

812
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,497
<i>you in this stage,</i>
<i>so unless you're holding</i>

813
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,708
<i>that immunity necklace</i>
<i>around you, who knows?</i>

814
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,276
We'll now bring in
the first member of our jury.

815
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,364
Erin will attend
all Tribal Councils.

816
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,241
She's here merely to observe.

817
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,494
You're not to
address her, either.

818
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,204
Now with the addition
of the jury,

819
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,415
you're voting people out who
you're then going to ask

820
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,459
to vote for you
to win this thing.

821
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,672
Politically, becomes very tough
to navigate through this.

822
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,674
-Clay.
-Yep?

823
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,925
Now that
it's an individual game,

824
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,760
how does it change how you look

825
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,220
at the other seven members,
in terms of threat?

826
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,764
Everybody's kind of
figuring out,

827
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,559
where do I stand in-in this
tribe that we got now?

828
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,435
How strong am I of a competitor?
What's...

829
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,648
What's Penny's, uh, strong
points or her weak points?

830
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,483
Then you got to turn around
and look at Ted--

831
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,069
what's his strong points
and what his weak points are.

832
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,864
And you've got to try
to figure out

833
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:02,243
how I could fit in a-and beat
the both the big and the little.

834
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,078
And I'm not a real big guy.

835
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,747
And so it, uh, it plays on you.

836
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,417
Jake, do you think everybody
is exactly as they appear?

837
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,253
Well, I keep... I keep trying

838
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,714
to focus on the way I'm playing
the game.

839
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,257
And I keep trying to be
just who I am,

840
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,302
as genuine as I possibly can be.

841
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,013
But, you know, it's a game,

842
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,473
and it's filled with lies,
and we just have to accept that

843
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,226
and try to ferret out

844
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,062
the ones that we think
are doing it the most,

845
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,900
get rid of them as quickly
as possible and go on.

846
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,986
Big Ted, had any moments
at camp where you thought,

847
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,237
"Eh, maybe I shouldn't
have said that;

848
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,447
that might have come off
the wrong way"?

849
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,783
I-I haven't done anything
that I regret.

850
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,912
However, there was a point
where I was feeling

851
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,330
basically homesick.

852
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,457
Um, I think that challenge
that we had where I actually

853
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,418
got to see a picture of my baby,
I thought that was

854
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,295
going to have
a positive impact with me.

855
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,465
However, I felt real depressed
and down and blue

856
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,091
because I couldn't
hold my daughter,

857
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,968
I couldn't play
with my daughter.

858
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,971
So the way I rectified
that situation is by taking

859
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,348
some quality me time,

860
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,308
just basically, you know,
clearing all that blueness,

861
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,353
which is going to get me
to the end,

862
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,520
as far as this game takes me.

863
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,357
Penny, you starting to notice
things about people

864
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,151
that you didn't notice
the first 26 days?

865
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,444
Not really.

866
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,446
Um, I've just, you know,
frankly enjoyed

867
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:24,367
the merge that we've had and
I think it's been more relaxing,

868
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,328
myself, around camp,
because now we can all take on

869
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:32,124
the same excitement and the same
joy that we all have as a group.

870
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,502
Brian, what's tonight's vote
going to be based on?

871
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:40,049
Past performances, um, uh...
general working around camp--

872
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,176
those that, uh,
work a little harder,

873
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,011
those that, uh,
don't do as much.

874
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,055
So probably, uh, production--

875
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,307
or lack of production,
I should say.

876
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,308
PROBST:
Okay. Clay.

877
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,393
Yes, sir?

878
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,813
With that immunity necklace
around your throat,

879
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,815
you are safe
from the vote tonight.

880
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,233
And doesn't it feel good.

881
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,526
PROBST: That said,
you cannot vote for Clay.

882
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,903
Everybody else is vulnerable.

883
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,154
It is time to vote.

884
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:02,530
Helen, you're first.

885
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,420
Hope to see you soon,
and, uh, a great player.

886
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,778
I really didn't know
who to vote.

887
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,530
I really have enjoyed
meeting you.

888
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,407
I've really enjoyed knowing you.

889
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,575
Bye.

890
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,604
You're a neat guy,

891
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,732
but you got to get rid of
the strong for me to keep going.

892
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,571
I'll go tally the votes.

893
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,790
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

894
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,416
The person voted out
will be asked

895
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,126
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

896
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,295
I'll read the votes.

897
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,507
First vote...

898
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,677
Ted.

899
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,724
Ted.

900
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,605
Ted.

901
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,732
That's three votes, Ted.

902
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,194
Ken.

903
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,741
Ken.

904
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,327
That's two votes Ken.

905
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,664
Ken.

906
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,415
We're tied at three votes.

907
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:22,711
NYC.

908
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,005
Ken.

909
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,384
That's four votes Ken,
three votes Ted.

910
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,847
Last vote...

911
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,849
Ken.

912
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,684
Need to bring me your torch.

913
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,739
Ken, the tribe has spoken.

914
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,743
It's time for you to go.

915
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,795
Good luck, everyone.

916
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,261
Head back to camp.

917
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,679
Good night.

918
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,653
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

919
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,867
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor...

920
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,953
<i>Ted feels the sting</i>
<i>of receiving three votes.</i>

921
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,789
I got three votes
from the members of Sook Jai.

922
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,875
<i>CLAY: Ted didn't know we</i>
<i>instigated those three votes</i>

923
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,751
for him, and, uh, and he won't.

924
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,588
PROBST:
<i>Someone gets a big reward.</i>

925
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,923
<i>You'll be treated to a</i>
<i>once-in-a-lifetime experience.</i>

926
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,509
<i>It's a chance</i>
<i>to get away from camp,</i>

927
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,927
<i>come back with a belly full.</i>

928
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,642
This is definitely
a life-altering experience.

929
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,561
Um, you learn
how to appreciate things

930
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,896
like you never have before.

931
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,606
<i>Like bananas, like,</i>
<i>that's such a life-giving,</i>

932
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,108
<i>delicious, incredible thing.</i>

933
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,777
<i>And if, uh, anybody feels sorry</i>
<i>for me, you know,</i>

934
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,154

<i>you know,</i>

935
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,406
<i>chocolate chip cookies,</i>

936
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,115
<i>It's my favorite sweet thing.</i>

937
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,661
Anyway, I'll see you all soon.
