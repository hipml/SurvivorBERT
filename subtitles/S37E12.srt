1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:05,038
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,209
THERE WERE FOUR DAVIDS AND FOUR
GOLIATHS LEFT IN THE GAME.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:14,481
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL, NICK AND
GABBY REALIZED CRIST CRAN WAS

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,083
TOO BIG OF A THREAT.

5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,818
I DONT TRUST CHRISTIAN FULLY
ANYMORE.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,719
YOU PROBABLY NEVER WILL.

7
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:24,591
Jeff: BUT DAVIE WARNED
CHRISTIAN.

8
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,992
IM FLOORED.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,330
ACCORDING TO DAVIE, GABBY IS
GUNNING FOR ME.

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,266
Jeff: AT TROOUK, CHRISTIAN
PLAYED HIS IDOL.

11
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,634
IM PLAYING THIS FOR MYSELF
TONIGHT.

12
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,237
Jeff: OKAY.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,739
WHICH SENT HIS CLOSEST ALLY TO
THE JURY.

14
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,074
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

15
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:46,112
LEAVING THE DAVIDS IN TOTAL
DISARRAY, AND THE GAME UP FOR

16
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:46,946
GRABS.

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,515
SEVEN ARE LEFT.

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:53,253
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:04,164
Captioning funded by CBS

20
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:11,538
Captioning funded by CBS

21
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:16,476
GOING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL, I
HAD BEEN INFORMED BY DAVIE THAT

22
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,212
I SHOULD PLAY MY IDOL TONIGHT.

23
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,013
I PLAYED MY IDOL.

24
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:20,780
I SURVIVED.

25
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,283
BUT I STILL GOT FIVE VOITS VOTS.

26
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:27,487
IT INDICATES THAT IM A TARGET
TO SOME PEOPLE, INCLUDING NICK.

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,658
I SUSPECTED NICKS MOTIVES FOR
QUITE A BIT NOW, BECAUSE HES

28
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,695
NOT REALLY BEING HONEST WITH ME.

29
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:36,763
SERIOUSLY.

30
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,964
IM SORRY.

31
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,668
IM KIND OF BUMMED BECAUSE
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO WAS IF

32
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,238
CHRISTIAN GOES HOME WITH AN IDOL
IN HIS POCKET, BUT HE PLAYED IT.

33
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,142
THE GOOD THING IS USUALLY THAT
MEANS ANOTHER IDOL IS PUT BACK

34
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:53,346
INTO THE GAME, AND I WANT TO BE
THE PERSON TO FIND IT.

35
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,517
SO TO DO THAT, IVE MADE, LIKE,
A FAKE IMMUNITY IDOL, AND

36
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,286
HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY CAN FIND THAT
IDOL, AND THEN THE SEARCH IS

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,823
OFF, AND ILL BE THE ONLY ONE
LEFT LOOKING.

38
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:09,162
AND THATS THE PARCHMENT OF MY
REAL IDOL, AND I MADE IT OUT OF

39
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,563
STUFF IVE BEEN COLLECTING
THROUGH THE WEEKS.

40
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,200
AND I TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO
HIDE IT UNDER THE RAFT.

41
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:19,405
SO LATER ON, IM AT THE RAFT
WITH ANG LEAN AMIKE, AND

42
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,675
CHRISTIAN, ALL FOUR OF US THERE,
AND IM THINKING, YOU KNOW WHAT?

43
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,511
ILL FIND IT RIGHT HERE IN FRONT
OF EVERYBODY.

44
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:29,516
I STARTED KICKING AROUND A
STICK, LIKE, IN THE DIRT.

45
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,520
AND THEN I PULLED IT OUT AND IM
LIKE--

46
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,588
SHUT UP "P" WAIT, STOP!

47
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,489
DID YOU FIND IT?

48
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,624
SHHH!

49
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,192
HE DID.

50
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,593
HE FOUND THE IDOL.

51
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,795
DID YOU FIND THE IDOL?

52
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,799
OH, MY GOSH!

53
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,433
THATS YOURS.

54
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,935
THATS YOURS.

55
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,004
OH, MY GOD, I CANT BELIEVE THEY
FELL FOR THAT.

56
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,740
EVERYBODY ERUPTS WITH
EXCITEMENT, AND IM JUST LETTING

57
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,441
EVERYBODY CONGRATULATE ME.

58
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,810
AND THE WHOLE TIME THIS IDOL IS
FAKE.

59
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,444
ITS NOT REAL.

60
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,113
AND IT JUST WORKS BEAUTIFUL.

61
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:00,847
LIKE, ITS TOO EASY.

62
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,781
CONGRATULATIONS.

63
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,151
ITS BASICALLY LIKE CALLING
OFF THE DOGS.

64
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,319
THE SEARCH IS OVER.

65
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,855
NOBODY IS GOING TO BE LOOKING
FOR THE IDOL, EXCEPT ME, AND

66
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,391
THAT MEANS I CAN FIND IT, AND
THEN I HAVE TWO IDOLS.

67
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,361
ME, ANG LENA, CHRISTIAN, AND
NICK WERE SITTING ON THE RAFT,

68
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,232
AND NICK JUST REACHES UNDER THE
RAFT AND FINDS THE IDOL JUST

69
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:19,599
NOW.

70
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,467
STOP IT.

71
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,838
NICK FOUND A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL UNDER THE RAFT, BUT IM

72
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,608
LIKE, I DONT KNOW, MAN.

73
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,411
I WAS BORN AT NIGHT, BUT I
WASNT BORN LAST NIGHT.

74
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:36,082
AND IM THINKING TO MYSELF,
HMMM, HES ALREADY GOT ONE IDOL.

75
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:40,086
WHAT IF HE JUST SIMPLY PULLED
OUT THE IDOL THAT HE HAS AND

76
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:44,624
OPENED IT UP IN FRONT OF THEM SO
NOBODY WOULD BE LOOKING FOR

77
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,692
IDOLS.

78
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,260
HES SMART ENOUGH TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, DAVIE.

79
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:53,866
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST KEEP
LOOKING FOR IDOLS.

80
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,670
IM, LIKE, DAVIE, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT GOD HAS OUT HERE FOR YOU.

81
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:11,150
JUST SNOOP AROUND A LITTLE BIT
MORE.

82
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:16,189
SO IM LOOKING FOR THE IDOL,
GOING OVER BY THE WATERING HOLE.

83
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,324
IM LOOKING FOR ANY TYPE OF
RIBBONS.

84
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,729
IM LOOKING FOR ANY TYPE OF
ROLLED-UP SCROLLS.

85
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,896
NO LUCK.

86
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,266
AND IM KIND OF JUST DEPRESSED
AND MAYBE THERE REALLY ISNT

87
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,533
ANYTHING OUT HERE.

88
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,337
AND IF NICKS GOT TWO IDOLS, HE
COULD GO ALL THE WAY AND BEAT US

89
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:31,738
ALL, YOU KNOW.

90
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,939
HES A THREAT.

91
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:37,677
SO I NEED HELP TO TAKE OUT MY
BEST FRENEMY IN THIS GAME, MY

92
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,145
BOY NICK.

93
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,248
WELL, CHRISTIAN, CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING?

94
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,483
NICK HAS TWO IDOLS.

95
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,186
HOW THE-- HE FOUND THE SECOND
IDOL EXPWROO WE WOULD HAVE TO

96
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,023
TAKE CARE OF HIM THIS NEXT
TRIBE.

97
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,624
DAVE SAYS, GUESS WHAT?

98
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,961
WE MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF
NICK AT THIS NEXT TRIBAL

99
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,162
COUNCIL.

100
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,431
I SEE HIM GETTING READY TO
PICK ME AND YOU OFF WHEN THAT

101
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:58,865
OPPORTUNITY STRIKES.

102
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,999
OKAY.

103
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,736
AND IM THINKING, THATS
FANTASTIC BECAUSE NICK IS NOT IN

104
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,138
MY CORNER.

105
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,408
AND MOVING FORWARD, I HAVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT SOME OTHER THREAT

106
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,512
GOES OTHER THAN ME.

107
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:29,495
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

108
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,398
ALL RIGHT, SHALL WE GET TO
TODAYS REWARD CHALLENGE?

109
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:32,832
YES.

110
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:33,866
YEAH.

111
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,401
Jeff: FOR TODAYS
CHALLENGE, YOURE GOING TO BE

112
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,436
ATTACHED TO A ROPE.

113
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,406
ON MY "GO," YOULL RACE TO
GATHER THAT ROPE.

114
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,409
WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH,
YOULL RACE OVER AND UNDER A

115
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,346
SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

116
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:51,050
YOULL THEN USE SANDBAGS AND
ATTEMPT TO KNOCK OVER A STACK OF

117
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:51,851
BLOCKS.

118
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,020
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.

119
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,555
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOURE PLAYING
FOR.

120
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,089
YES.

121
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,223
YEAH.

122
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,860
Jeff: YOULL BE TAKEN BY
HELICOPTER TO THE MALA MALA

123
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,797
BEACH CLUBS, TRULY ONE OF THE
MOST SPECTACULAR PLACES IN FIJI

124
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,434
WHERE YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO
THEIR ENTIRE MENU-- SURF AND

125
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,703
TURF, SLIDERS, FRIED CHICKEN.

126
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,572
OH, MY GOD!

127
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:13,272
Jeff: SANDWICHES.

128
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:13,840
WOW.

129
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,674
Jeff: THE WORKS.

130
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,875
WOW.

131
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,779
Jeff: YOU RETURN BACK TO
CAMP REFRESHED, REJUVENATED AND

132
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,948
REFUELED IN TIME FOR THE NEXT
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

133
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,249
THIS IS A BIG REWARD.

134
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:23,916
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

135
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,752
WELL GET STARTED.

136
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:33,326
OH, GOD, JUST THINKING ABOUT
IT.

137
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,028
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE
GO, FOR REWARD.

138
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,964
SURVIVORS READY?

139
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:38,898
YUP.

140
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:43,269
Jeff: GO!

141
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:47,974
FIRST JOB IS TO GATHER ENOUGH
ROPE.

142
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,844
OW!

143
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,347
Jeff: THE QUESTION IS HOW
MUCH IS ENOUGH?

144
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,417
ARE YOU TRYING TO GUESSTIMATE
HOW MUCH YOU NEED TO GET THROUGH

145
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,721
THE OBSTACLES TO THE SANDBAGS
AND WHERE THE SANDBAGS ARE GOING

146
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,257
TO LAND ONCE YOU THROW THEM.

147
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,691
SOMEBODY GETTING READY TO MAKE A
MOVE.

148
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,493
ITS GOING TO BE DAVIE HEADING
OUT FIRST.

149
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,062
HE THINKS HE HAS ENOUGH.

150
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,032
NOBODY ELSE LEADING YET.

151
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:18,037
DAVIE OVER AND UNDER THE
OBSTACLES.

152
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,108
DAVIE FIRST TO GET TO HIS
SANDBAGS.

153
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,411
HE TOSSES AND KNOCKS A FEW
BLOCKS OFF.

154
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,747
HERE COMES ALISON.

155
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,682
HERE COMES ANGELINA NOW GETTING
IN ON IT.

156
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,050
HERE COMES NICK.

157
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,919
WILL THEY HAVE ENOUGH ROPE?

158
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,855
DAVE WEANOTHER NICE TOSS.

159
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:36,789
FOUR BLOCKS HIT.

160
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,825
YOU HAVE TO KNOCK THE BLOCKS
COMPLETELY OFF.

161
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:43,095
DOES DAVIE HAVE ENOUGH ROPE NOW
TO GET TO HIS SANDBAGS?

162
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,130
HE DOESNT.

163
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,766
HE CAN ONLY GET TWO, AND THAT IS
GOING TO COST HIM.

164
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:53,406
DAVIE NOW WORKING WITH JUST TWO
SANDBAGS, WHICH OPENS THE DOOR

165
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,540
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

166
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,141
ALISON FIRING.

167
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,510
TOO BAD I CANT THROW!

168
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,948
Jeff: HERE COMES NICK AND
ANGELINA.

169
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,783
NICK WITH A HUGE HIT!

170
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,084
AND ANOTHER BIG HIT.

171
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:10,089
IT IS DAVIE AND NICK RIGHT NOW.

172
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,993
DAVIES STRETCHING OUT AS FAR AS
HE CAN TO GET TWO BAGS.

173
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,361
KARA NOW IN ON IT.

174
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,331
KARA WITH A NICE HIT.

175
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,632
NICK MISSES.

176
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,467
ANGELINA DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH
ROPE.

177
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,301
SHES GOT TO GO BACK.

178
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,537
A HUGE STEP BACK FOR ANGELINA.

179
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,541
SHES GOT TO GO WAY BACK TO THE
START.

180
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,209
KARA WITH A BIG HIT.

181
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,477
SHES IN IT NOW.

182
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,612
NO!

183
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,448
Jeff: IF YOU DONT HAVE
ENOUGH ROPE, YOUVE GOT TO GO

184
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:35,815
BACK.

185
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,284
DAMN IT!

186
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:43,523
Jeff: DAVIE DOWN TO TWO
BLOCKS LEFT.

187
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,157
NICK WITH A HIT.

188
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,094
DAVIE COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

189
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,762
HE HAS ONE BLOCK LEFT.

190
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,997
NICK WITH TWO BLOCKS.

191
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,898
DAVIE WITH ONE.

192
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:56,002
WHO WILL GET BACK QUICK ENOUGH
FOR A SHOT?

193
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,670
NICK KNOCKS ONE OFF.

194
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,907
NICK DOWN TO HIS LAST BLOCK, AND
DAVIE DOWN TO HIS LAST BLOCK.

195
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,278
IT IS IT FOR THE WIN.

196
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,979
AND ANOTHER MISS!

197
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,849
NICK, GOING FOR THE WIN?

198
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,950
 OH!

199
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,984
Jeff: NICK HITS IT.

200
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,185
IT DOESNT GO OFF.

201
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,022
IT IS BACK AND FORTH.

202
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,390
DAVIE DOES IT FOR THE WIN!

203
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,357
NICE!

204
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,595
Jeff: DAVIE WINS REWARD!

205
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,898
OH, BABY!

206
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,301
THAT WAS A NAIL-BITER.

207
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,769
Jeff: THAT WAS A SHOOT-OUT.

208
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,271
GOOD JOB, DAVIE.

209
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,041
Jeff: DAVIE, COME ON OVER.

210
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,509
CONGRATS, DAVIE.

211
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,410
CONGRATULATIONS.

212
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,110
THANK YOU, GUYS.

213
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,111
HARD FOUGHT, MAN.

214
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,646
Jeff: BIG WIN ON DAY 33.

215
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,449
YOU ALREADY KNOW YOURE GOING TO
ENJOY FOOD, BEVERAGES.

216
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:48,087
THE QUESTION IS WHO IS GOING TO
JOIN YOU?

217
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,958
CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO COME ALONG.

218
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,694
LOOK AT THOSE FACES.

219
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,761
YOU FEEL THAT PRESSURE?

220
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,129
ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.

221
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,998
Jeff: SO WHAT IS THE
FEELING RIGHT NOW?

222
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:03,869
THE FEELING IS I HAVE TO BASE
MY DECISION ON THE PEOPLE THAT

223
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,605
IVE BEEN CLOSEST WITH THE
LONGEST.

224
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,775
AND I HAVE TO REPAY NICK BACK
FOR HIS DEBT FOR CHOOSING ME FOR

225
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,177
THE FAMILY VISIT.

226
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,047
Jeff: NICK, COME ON OVER.

227
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,949
BEE BOTH CHOSE YOU, DAVIE.

228
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,186
Jeff: NOW, BEFORE DAVIE
MAKES HIS FINAL CHOICE OF WHOS

229
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:28,394
GOING TO JOIN HIM, DOES ANYBODY
HERE WANT TO PLEAD THEIR CASE?

230
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,330
DAVIE, THE HARD PART--
 I WILL SAY SOMETHING, DAVIE,

231
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,034
I HATE TO PULL THIS CARD, BUT
WHEN I-- WHEN I GOT THE RICE FOR

232
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,769
THE TRIBE, YOU WON IMMUNITY.

233
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,237
AND I WAS SO PROUD OF YOU.

234
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,172
AND WEVE BEEN ABLE TO EAT
BECAUSE OF THAT.

235
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,943
I REALLY DIDNT WANT TO PULL
THAT OUT, BUT IF THAT MEANS

236
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,046
ANYTHING, THIS WOULD MEAN
EVERYTHING TO ME TODAY.

237
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,984
I REALLY THINK-- IVE GOT TO
LOOK OUT FOR THE PERSON THATS

238
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:56,422
BEEN LOOK OUT FOR ME EVER SINCE
WE WERE BACK ON THE VUKU TRIBE.

239
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:56,989
KARA.

240
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:57,490
IVE GOT TO GO WITH HER.

241
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,658
THANK YOU.

242
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,126
Jeff: KARA, COME ON OVER.

243
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,193
OH, MY GOD.

244
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,162
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

245
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,998
SORRY, GUYS.

246
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,033
SORRY.

247
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,768
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, DAVIE, YOU
CHOSE KARA AND NICK.

248
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,836
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE A FUN
AFTERNOON.

249
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,071
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.

250
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,106
HAVE A GOOD TIME ON THE
"SURVIVOR" HELICOPTER.

251
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,775
HAVE A GREAT TIME.

252
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:16,942
SORRY.

253
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,812
Jeff: ANGELINA, ALISON,
CHRISTIAN, MIKE, GOT NOTHING FOR

254
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,246
YOU.

255
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:20,780
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

256
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,947
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

257
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,917
I DIDNT WANT TO USE ME
WINNING RICE FOR THE CRIEB AS

258
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,288
ANY KIND OF CURRENCY, BUT DAVIE
CHOOSES KARA OVER ME.

259
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,324
AND I CANT HELP BUT THINK DAVIE
IS PLAYING THE FIELD.

260
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,028
DAVIE IS KEEPING ALL HIS OPTIONS
OPEN RIGHT NOW, SO IT COULD BE A

261
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,264
MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE.

262
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,243
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

263
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:51,977
RICE!

264
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,481
WOOO!

265
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,884
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN 33 DAYS
THAT I TRULY FEEL, LIKE, ANGRY,

266
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,186
SO IM JUST--
 YEAH.

267
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,121
BUT IN THIS MOMENT ITS JUST
KIND OF LIKE--

268
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,322
A BITTER TASTE.

269
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,726
WELL, ITS JUST LIKE
SURPRISED.

270
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,931
I COME BACK TO CAMP, AND IM
LEGITIMATELY PISSED.

271
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,935
YOU KNOW, I CANT BELIEVE THAT
DAVIE WOULD CHOOSE KARA OVER ME.

272
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:20,072
AND THE OTHER THING IS, LIKE--
AGAIN IM NOT-- I DO NOT WANT

273
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,309
ANY RECIPROCITY OR FAVOR ABOUT
THE RICE, BUT I STEPPED OUT OF A

274
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,611
PUZZLE CHALLENGE IN ORDER FOR US
ALL TO HAVE RICE.

275
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,147
SO ITS, LIKE, COME ON, DAVIE.

276
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,015
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT IS HIS OWN
DECISION.

277
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,584
LETS TALK ABOUT THAT OVER
SOME RICE!

278
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,585
HAVE SOME RICE.

279
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,053
IM JUST FUMING.

280
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:38,791
SO I SPRING INTO ACTION TO MAKE
THE BIGGEST POOT OF RICE THAT WE

281
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,625
CAN MANAGE.

282
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:46,031
I GUESS IT WAS REVENGE RICE.

283
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,568
YEAH!

284
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:54,840
BY CHOOSING KARA AND BY
CHOOSING NICK, THIS IS THE EXACT

285
00:12:54,874 --> 00:13:00,045
EPITOME OF KEEP MY FRENEMIES
CLOSE, NICK; AND MY FRIENDS

286
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,213
CLOSER, KARA.

287
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,651
I DEFINITELY KNOW THAT THERE
WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY AT THE

288
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,920
REWARD FOR JUST ME AND KARA TO
TALK.

289
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,255
BOOLA!

290
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,392
AND THATS WHEN I WOULD HAVE
MY CHANCE TO PUT MY PLAN INTO

291
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:17,463
ACTION, WHICH IS GETTING NICK
OUT OF THIS GAME.

292
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,734
FINALLY, US THREE GET TO
SPEND TIME TOGETHER

293
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,067
UNINTERRUPTED.

294
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,269
UH-HUH.

295
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:29,275
THIS REWARD IS LIKE "GOODFELLAS"
IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE THEM

296
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,478
OUT, YOURE GOING TO TREAT THEM
REALLY WELL AND THEN SLIT THEIR

297
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,746
THROATS IN THE END.

298
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,349
I OVERDID IT.

299
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,319
SO, YES, NOW THAT NICKS
GONE...

300
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,287
YES.

301
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,988
ARE YOU READY FOR SOME BIG
BOMBS RIGHT NOW?

302
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,290
YES.

303
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,694
NOT ONLY DOES NICK HAVE AN
IDOL, BUT HE MAY POSSIBLY HAVE

304
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,595
TWO IDOLS.

305
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,396
ANOTHER ONE?

306
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,831
YEAH.

307
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,065
HE NEEDS TO GET OUT.

308
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,834
EXACTLY.

309
00:13:54,867 --> 00:14:00,172
EVERYBODY AT CAMP KNOWS THAT
NICK NOW HAS THE IDOL THAT WAS

310
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,440
FOUND UNDERNEATH THE RAFT.

311
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:06,245
BUT I AM SHOCKED WHEN DAVIE SAYS
THAT NICK HAS YET ANOTHER IDOL.

312
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,415
I MEAN, NICK IS A HUGE THREAT TO
EVERYONES GAME.

313
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:14,119
WHAT IM THINKING IS
TOMORROW, IF NICK DOESNT WIN,

314
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,923
ME, YOU, ALISON AND CHRISTIAN
CAN GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

315
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,960
IM SO DOWN FOR THAT BECAUSE
THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING TO

316
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:21,660
BEGIN WITH.

317
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,496
DONT TELL ANGELINA AND MIKE.

318
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,664
FOR SURE.

319
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,333
DAVIE WANTS TO VOTE OUT NICK AND
IM DROOLING AT THIS IDEA.

320
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,703
THIS SOUNDS LOOK A FEASIBLE PLAN
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO TAKE

321
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:35,241
MY GAME TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

322
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,675
WHATS UP, MIKE?

323
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,276
IT WAS FUN?

324
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,811
IT WAS GREAT, MAN.

325
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,211
SORRY, DUDE.

326
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,247
NO WORRIES.

327
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,648
MIKE, YOURE THE BEST
WELCOMING COMMITTEE.

328
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,517
SO COMING BACK TO CAMP MY NUMBER
ONE CONVERSATION HAS TO BE WITH

329
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,118
ALISON.

330
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,954
TELL ME ABOUT THE FOOD.

331
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,891
BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR THIS
PLAN TO HAPPEN, WE ALSO NEED TO

332
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:56,095
GET ALISON ON BOARD TO GO ALONG
WITH THIS.

333
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,331
SO NICK HAS THE IDOL IN CASE YOU
DONT KNOW.

334
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:04,737
AND SO DAVIE WANTS TO VOTE NICK
OUT, AND HE WANTS IT TO BE ME,

335
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,673
YOU, DAVIE, AND CHRISTIAN.

336
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,874
OH, MY GOD.

337
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,877
TO VOTE NICK, AND THEN LEAVE
ANGELINA AND MIKE OUT OF IF.

338
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,980
BECAUSE IF WE RISK AT ALL
TELLING THEM, TOO, I FEEL THEY

339
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,515
WOULD USE IT TO TELL NICK.

340
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,616
THIS IS INSANE.

341
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,186
KARA REVEALS TO ME THAT DAVIE
NOW IS GUNNING FOR NICK.

342
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,058
I JUST KIND OF SMILED BECAUSE IN
THE PAST, I HAVE BEEN ON THE

343
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,893
BOTTOM, AND I WAS GOING TO BE
NEXT OUT.

344
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:33,365
ALL OF A SUDDEN, IM NO LONGER
PRESSED UP AGAINST THE WALL, BUT

345
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,504
INSTEAD, PERHAPS, MAKING A MOVE.

346
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,406
OH, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

347
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,373
SO EXCITING.

348
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,176
SO KARA GAVE ME SOME HUGE

521
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,312
AND WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

522
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,416
IT IS A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TWO
GOLIATHS.

523
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,086
15 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS ROUND,
AND WE WILL ADD A THIRD BALL.

524
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,687
HANG IN THERE.

525
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:26,791
YOURE ALMOST THERE.

526
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,125
FIVE.

527
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,760
FOUR.

528
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,562
THREE.

529
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,930
TWO.

530
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:32,397
ONE.

531
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,031
YOURE BOTH SAFE.

532
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:33,632
GRAB YOUR BECAUSE.

533
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,066
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

534
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:42,674
Jeff: WE WILL MOVE TO THE
THIRD AND FINAL ROUND.

535
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,545
ALL RIGHT, WE ARE IN THE FINAL
ROUND OF THIS CHALLENGE.

536
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:51,049
FOR IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED SPOT IN
THE FINAL SIX.

537
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,351
ALISON TRYING TO OVERCOME
WOBBLING LEGS.

538
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,855
THAT HAS BEEN THE THING THAT HAS
HAUNTED HER THIS ENTIRE

539
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,455
CHALLENGE.

540
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,790
CAN SHE GET IT IN CONTROL?

541
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,760
IT WOULD BE ALISONS SECOND
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN.

542
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,662
IT WOULD BE MIKES FIRST.

543
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:08,033
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TO BE
SECURE ON "SURVIVOR."

544
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,468
MIKE STARTING TO WOBBLE A
LITTLE.

545
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,438
GOTTA GET IT BACK IN CONTROL.

546
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:17,809
MIKE WITH ONE BALL ON THE EDGE
OF HIS DISK.

547
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,444
MIKES BALLS NOW ON THE MOVE.

548
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:29,087
THE BALL HANGING ON THE EDGE OF
HIS DISK.

549
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,688
ALISON DROPS.

550
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:30,555
SHES OUT.

551
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,593
MIKE WINS HIS FIRST INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.

552
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:40,465
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

553
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:45,570
YAY!

554
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,405
Jeff: MIKE, COME ON OVER.

555
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,775
YAY, MIKE!

556
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,646
Jeff: MIKE, INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY IS YOURS, SAFE TONIGHT

557
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,747

AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, ONE OF
YOU WILL SEE YOUR DREAM COME TO

561
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,956
AN END, BECOME THE SEVENTH
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

562
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,292
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

563
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:07,626
CONGRATS.

564
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,827
THANKS.

565
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,630
BEING ABLE TO WIN AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE TODAY IS THRILLING.

566
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:16,134
AND RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE IM A
LITTLE LESS NERVOUS SWINGING

567
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,403
FROM THE HIP BECAUSE I HAVE THIS
IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

568
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:22,173
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO
WHAT WILL SERVE MY GAME THE

569
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,843
BEST.

570
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,655
♪ ♪
 GOING INTO TONIGHTS TRIBAL

571
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,972
COUNCIL, I WANTED TO GET RID OF
CHRISTIAN, BUT ALISON WAS SUPER

572
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,409
CLOSE TO BINNING THE CHALLENGE,
AND SHES A HUGE PHYSICAL

573
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,744
THREAT.

574
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:05,984
AND IM WORRIED AND NERVOUS THAT
THERES MORE GOLIATHS THAN

575
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:06,518
DAVIDS.

576
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,186
THANK YOU, GUYS.

577
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,222
AND IT FEELS LIKE THE TIME IS
RIGHT FOR ALISON.

578
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,758
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

579
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,227
I KNEW WE WERE GONNA TALK.

580
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:16,895
YEAH, I THINK EVERYONES
GOING TO TALK TODAY.

581
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,096
WHO ARE YOU THINKING?

582
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,965
I WOULD RATHER VOTE ALISON
TONIGHT IF I CAN.

583
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,801
ALISON THIS TIME.

584
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:23,268
CHRISTIAN NEXT TIME.

585
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,536
OKAY.

586
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,605
TO ME ITS HILARIOUS THAT SO
MANY PEOPLE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT

587
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,441
GETTING ALISON OUT.

588
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,310
THEY DONT KNOW THERES A PLAN
IN PLACE TO TAKE OUT NICK.

589
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,646
THATS HOW YOU EXECUTE A GOOD
BLINDSIDE.

590
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,214
YOU CANT LET EVERYBODY IN ON
IT.

591
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,817
IM EXCITED TO BE PART OF A
BLINDSIDE THAT WOULD CHANGE THE

592
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,852
REST OF THE GAME COMPLETELY.

593
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,225
IS THAT OKAY?

594
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,693
YEAH, IM FINE.

595
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,130
I FIND OUT THAT THERES TWO
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS BEING RUN.

596
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,433
THERES THIS BIG PUSH TO HAVE
ALISON OUT.

597
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,769
AND AT THE SAME TIME, DAVIE IS
GUNNING FOR NICK.

598
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,805
BUT HAVING THE IMMUNITY
NECKLACE, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT

599
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,040
MORE BOLD.

600
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,576
IM EXCITED, LIKE, THIS IS WHAT
YOU COME TO "SURVIVOR" FOR IS

601
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,747
TO, LIKE, HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE
GAME, AND IM THINKING CHRISTIAN

602
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,715
IS STILL THE BIGGEST THREAT TO
WIN THE GAME.

603
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:17,822
AND SO I GOTTA GET THE VOTES TO
GET CHRISTIAN HOME TONIGHT.

604
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:22,560
I JUST HAD A NERVOUS FEELING
THAT THERES A PART OF ME THAT

605
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,429
THINKS MAYBE ITS TONIGHT FOR
CHRISTIAN.

606
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,732
I THINK NICK IS THE GREATER
THREAT.

607
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,935
ARE WE DOING SOMETHING
STUPID?

608
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,370
IS IT BETTER TO TAKE OUT
CHRISTIAN?

609
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,173
I WANT IT TO BE NICK.

610
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:39,144
IM HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS
ABOUT THIS ALISON THING.

611
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,245
UH-HUH.

612
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,148
BEYOND MY BASIC POSITION,
WHICH IS ALISON IS EASILY

613
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,950
BEATABLE IN THE END, CHRISTIAN
WILL WIN.

614
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,352
HE WILL BEAT ALL OF US.

615
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,088
WE WOULD BE CRAZY NOT TO TAKE
OUT CHRISTIAN NOW.

616
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,256
HE DOESNT HAVE IMMUNITY.

617
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,625
HE HAS NO MORE IDOLS.

618
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,527
ITS, LIKE, THIS IS THE TIME.

619
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,261
YEAH.

620
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:56,961
THINK ABOUT IT.

621
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,396
YEAH, I WILL THINK ABOUT IT.

622
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,332
RIGHT NOW I HAVE AS MUCH
LEVERAGE AS IM EVER GOG HAVE IN

623
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,534
THE GAME.

624
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,569
I HAVE AN IMMUNITY NECKLACE, AND
I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

625
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,838
LISTEN TO ME, BUT NO ONES
BUDGING.

626
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,274
SO ITS GETTING DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO MARSHAL THE TROOPS THEY NEED

627
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,109
TO GET CHRISTIAN OUT OF THE
GAME.

628
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,913
AND IT SHOULDNT BE THAT
DIFFICULT.

629
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,949
I DONT WANT--
 OH, WOW!

630
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,313
WHILE I WAS TALKING WITH NIRK HE
DECIDES TO COME CLEAN THAT HE

631
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,950
WAS LYING ABOUT HIS EXTRA IDOL.

632
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,419
AND NOW THAT HES TOLD ME THE
TRUTH, I DONT WANT HIM OUT OF

633
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,286
THE GAME ANYMORE.

634
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,055
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING LIED TO.

635
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,623
TURNS OUT, I WASNT.

636
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,725
THINGS HAVE CHANGED FULL CIRCLE.

637
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,660
SO NICK IS NO LONGER THE VOTE
TONIGHT.

638
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:07,999
AND ALISON IS.

639
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:14,205
I HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
THATS ONLY GOOD FOR TONIGHT.

640
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,241
THAT MEANS THAT IM GOING TO
HAVE TO PLAY IT TONIGHT.

641
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:21,613
AND IM HOPING TO SEE THAT
EVERYONE IS SET FOR ALISON VOTES

642
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:26,851
FOR ALISON.

643
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:31,189
I STILL WANT TO WORK WITH
NICK TO TAKE OUT CHRISTIAN.

644
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,259
BUT NICK KEEPS TALKING TO
CHRISTIAN, SO I FEEL LIKE I JUST

645
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:40,832
GOTTA LAY OUT ALL THE CARDS
BECAUSE THATS THE ONLY WAY IM

646
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,534
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET
CHRISTIAN OUT OF THE GAME.

647
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,203
DAVIES GUNNING FOR ME?

648
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,105
YES.

649
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,575
HE THINKS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THE IDOL, THAT NOW IS THE TIME

650
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,377
TO TAKE YOU OUT.

651
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,678
THATS WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

652
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,015
OKAY, SO HE HAS KARA.

653
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:07,225
TALK TO KARA ON THE REWARD
CHALLENGE.

654
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,329
I TELL NICK THAT DAVIE AND
KARA ARE VOTING FOR HIM.

655
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:19,203
AND NICK IS NOW GUNNING FOR
DAVIE.

656
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:24,676
AND THE OTHER PEOPLE WANT
ALISON GONE.

657
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,545
FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE CHRISTIAN
IS THE MOST LIKELY PERSON LEFT

658
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:28,780
IN THE GAME TO WIN.

659
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:32,550
BUT THE PROBLEM IS ITS REALLY
HARD TO KEEP A GROUP TOGETHER

660
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,953
WHEN THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN
AGENDA.

661
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,755
ITS LIKE YOU THINK WITH ONLY
SEVEN PEOPLE THERE WOULDNT BE

662
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,758
THAT MANY POSSIBILITIES, BUT IT
SEEMS LIKE THERES MORE

663
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,228
POSSIBILITIES TONIGHT THAN
THERES EVER BEEN BEFORE.

664
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:15,860
Jeff: WELL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

665
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:16,928
ELIZABETH.

666
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,329
JOHN.

667
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,764
DAN.

668
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,798
ALEC.

669
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,799
CARL.

670
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:29,240
AND GABBY, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

671
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,309
NICK, LETS TALK ABOUT WHERE WE
ARE IN THE GAME.

672
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,645
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO
SEVEN PEOPLE, THERES A TENDENCY

673
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,281
TO PLAY A LITTLE MORE
CONSERVATIVE AND JUST TRY TO GET

674
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,282
THROUGH A VOTE.

675
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,152
DO YOU SENSE ANY SHIFT IN THE
PACE OF THE GAME?

676
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,320
I DONT KNOW.

677
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,956
I THINK WERE STILL GOING 100
MILES PER HOUR.

678
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:49,994
I MEAN, TO PLAY TO WIN TO MAKE
IT TO TOMORROW.

679
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,630
I DONT THINK THAT CALLS FOR
MORE CONSERVATIVE PLAY.

680
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,333
SOMETIMES IT CALLS FOR MORE
AGGRESSIVE PLAY.

681
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,102
Jeff: AND, ATOMIC, THE
ESSENTIAL DILEMMA WHEN YOU GET

682
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,372
THIS CLOSE TO THE END IS YOU TRY
TO VOTE PEOPLE OUT, BUT YOU ALSO

683
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,175
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE YOU
LATEST BEHIND WILL BRING YOU TO

684
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,309
THE END.

685
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,212
YES, AND I PUT WAY MORE
WEIGHT IN WHOS LEFT AND WHO I

686
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,380
CAN WORK WITH?

687
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,983
ITS A WEIRD GAME, AND ITS
INDIVIDUAL AND YOU HAVE TO DO

688
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:12,650
YOUR SELF-INTEREST.

689
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,085
YOU CANT TRUST ANYONE, RIGHT?

690
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,155
THESE ARE ALL THE MESSAGES YOU
GOAT "SURVIVOR."

691
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,557
BUT YOU CANT GET TO THE END
WITHOUT LEANING ON OTHERS.

692
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,093
Jeff: DAVIE, THATS THE
TRICK, ISNT IT-- YOU CANT

693
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,961
TRUST ANYBODY BUT YOU HAVE TO
TRUST SOMEBODY.

694
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,563
THAT IS THE TRICK, JEFF.

695
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:29,534
I MEAN, YOURE TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT CAN I TRUST THIS DAY ONE

696
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,670
PERSON OR THIS OTHER PERSON THEY
MET AT THE MERGE OR THIS OTHER

697
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,605
PERSON THEY MET AT THE SWAP?

698
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,441
ITS JUST A MIND FRENZY.

699
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,843
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, THE TOUGH
PART ABOUT LOYALTY, IS WHEN YOU

700
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,313
REACH THAT CROSSROADS WHEN THE
PERSON OR PEOPLE YOURE LOYAL TO

701
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,816
ARE ALSO YOUR BIGGEST THREATS.

702
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:49,620
YOU SUMMARIZED, I THINK, THE
GAME OF "SURVIVOR" PRETTY WELL,

703
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,090
AND THE FACT THAT FOR MYSELF,
PERSONALLY, I HAVE TO REALLY

704
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,658
CONSIDER WHO IS WILLING TO WORK
WITH ME.

705
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,194
I MEAN, EVERY SINGLE PERSON
SITTING HERE HAS WRITTEN DOWN MY

706
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,130
NAME TO VOTE FOR ME AT SOME
POINT SINCE MERGE.

707
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:02,800
BUT FOR ME ITS HEAVILY WEIGHTED
ON WHO IS WILLING TO WORK WITH

708
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,870
ME, EVEN THAT PERSON MIGHT HAVE
BEEN AN ENEMY AS CLOSELY AS A

709
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,138
VOTE AGO.

710
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:11,976
TING MORE SPEAKS TO THE FLUID
NATURE OF THE GAME THAT WE HERE

711
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:16,247
ARE PLAYING IN THAT, YES, OLD
"SURVIVOR" WAS TIGHT VOTING

712
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,218
PACKS, AND HERE ITS A MUCH MORE
FLUID GAME OF WHAT IS NEXT FOR

713
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,552
THE NEXT VOTE?

714
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,689
Jeff: DAVIE, DO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT, IT REALLY IS TRIBAL

715
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:25,823
TO TRIBAL?

716
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,593
YEAH, IVE BEEN PREACHING
THAT FROM TRIBAL TO TRIBAL.

717
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,027
VOTING BLOCS, VOTING BLOCS.

718
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,730
YOU DONT KNOW WHO YOU CAN TRUST
AT THAT POINT IN THE GAME, THEN

719
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,065
THE NEXT POINT IN THE GAME.

720
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:38,469
THE GAME IS FLUID, AND ITS ALL
BASED ON VOTING BLOCKS.

721
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,670
I AGREE WITH THAT.

722
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,374
WING THIS GROUP, THERE IS NO
DEATH GRUDGE BETWEEN ANYBODY

723
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,575
HERE.

724
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,277
YOU KNOW, I THINK EVERYBODY
REALLY LIKES EACH OTHER AND, YOU

725
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,913
KNOW, YOU TRY TO VOTE PEOPLE OUT
AND THEN IT DOESNT WORK AND,

726
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,848
YOU KNOW, WE CAN STILL WORK
TOGETHER.

727
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,685
LIKE, SPEAKING TO CHRISTIANS
POINT, I VOTED HIM TWICE.

728
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,088
WHOEVER IM VOTING TONIGHT, IF
THEY DONT GO HOME TOMORROW,

729
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,156
ITS A NEW DAY.

730
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,192
AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT, YOU
KNOW, A FREE-FOR-ALL.

731
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,861
Jeff: NICK, IF ITS A
FREE-FOR-ALL DOES, THAT MEAN

732
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,797
STRATEGY IS OUT THE WINDOW, OR
DOES THAT MEAN THE STRATEGY IS

733
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,133
SO GOOD AND NOBODY IS FULLY
TELLING THE TRUTH?

734
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,836
I THINK THE STRATEGY IS THAT
GOOD.

735
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,072
YOU CAN COME IN HERE AND THINK
ITS A CLEAR SITUATION, BUT

736
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,340
THATS NEVER THE CASE.

737
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,777
SO, YEAH, I THINK THERES A HIGH
LEVEL OF GAME PLAY GOING ON, AND

738
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,548
ITS GO GOING ON BY EVERYTHING.

739
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,517
Jeff: ALISON, IS THERE A
CLEAR TYPE OF THREAT RIGHT NOW?

740
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,020
I THINK COMMON THREATS HAVE
BEEN IDENTIFIED.

741
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,590
AND ONCE YOUVE BEEN IDENTIFIED
AS A THREAT, ITS HARDER TO STAY

742
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,125
OFF OF PEOPLES HIT LISTS.

743
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,426
Jeff: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
YOURSELF?

744
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,594
YES.

745
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,897
WHEN YOU SURVIVE A COUPLE OF
TRIBALS, IT STARTS TO IDENTIFY

746
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,265
YOU AS SOMETHING OF A THREAT.

747
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,135
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, DO YOU
FEEL SIMILAR TO ALISON, THAT YOU

748
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:48,005
ARE AN ONGOING THREAT, AND,
THEREFORE, WILL ALWAYS BE IN

749
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,173
TROUBLE AT TRIBAL?

750
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,710
I-- I-- I MEAN YOU HOPE THAT
PEOPLES PERCEPTION OF YOU

751
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,745
CHANGE WHEN YOU REALIZE, HEY,
IM WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU.

752
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,281
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN STOP VOTING
FOR ME, PLEASE.

753
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,416
IVE HAD ENOUGH.

754
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,586
UN, THE I THINK THE RECORD IS 19
VOTES IN A GIVEN SEASON.

755
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,154
AND I HAVE 15.

756
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,956
SO, YOU KNOW, THATS PLENTY.

757
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,424
THATS PLENTY.

758
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,359
NO MORE, PLEASE.

759
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,594
( LAUGHING ).

760
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,396
Jeff: MIKE, WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHAT YOURE

761
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,400
DOING TONIGHT COULD LITERALLY BE
A MILLION-DOLLAR RIGHT DECISION

762
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:20,037
OR A MILLION-DOLLAR WRONG
DECISION, DOES THAT MAKE YOU

763
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,107
WANT TO SAY, "I JUST HAVE TO
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

764
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,377
THREATENING TO ME AND SEE IF I
CAN SWAY THE OTHERS TO GO MY

765
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,211
WAY?

766
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,514
WAY?"
 YEAH, IT GETS SO COMPLICATED.

767
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:34,318
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT I
TRUST, BUT THE WEIGHT OF HOLDING

768
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,621
YOUR CARDS CLOSE TO THE VEST AT
SOME POINT YOU WANT TO BE LIKE,

769
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,690
"THIS IS WHAT I KNOW TO BE THE
TRUTH."

770
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,326
AND HAVING THIS AROUND MY NECK
MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE

771
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,597
LIKE I NEED TO MAKE AN IMPACT
FOR TONIGHT.

772
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,033
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME
TO VOTE.

773
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,069
KARA, YOURE UP.

774
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:42,720
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

775
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,222
Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

776
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:55,299
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

777
00:38:55,299 --> 00:39:00,638
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

778
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,874
JEFF, IM PLAYING THIS FOR ME
TONIGHT.

779
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:09,980
Jeff: OKAY.

780
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,583
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

781
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,654
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DAVIE WILL
NOT COUNT.

782
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,254
OKAY.

783
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:23,060
HANG ON A SECOND, JEFF.

784
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:33,070
I FOUND THIS BY THE RAFT.

785
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,705
Jeff: NICK, YOURE PLAYING
THIS FOR YOURSELF?

786
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,843
WELL... ACTUALLY, THATS A
FAKE ONE I MADE.

787
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,747
I PLAYED A FAKE ONE TO GET A
READ ON THEM.

788
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,882
I WAS GOING TO, LIKE, SEE WHAT
THEY SAY.

789
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:53,157
I DONT THINK YOU NEED TO
PLAY IT, PERSONALLY, BUT...

790
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,125
OKAY.

791
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:57,128
I THINK I NEED TO PLAY MY REAL
IDOL.

792
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:03,701
I BETTER JUST BE SAFE.

793
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,638
I COULD BE WRONG, BUT... ITS
FOR ME.

794
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,841
Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

795
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,211
ANY VOTES CAST FOR NICK WILL NOT
COUNT.

796
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,648
ILL READ THE VOTES.

797
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,884
FIRST VOTE, DAVIE.

798
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,521
DOES NOT COUNT.

799
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:23,954
DAVIE.

800
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,825
DOES NOT COUNT.

801
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:28,259
ALISON.

802
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:32,329
ONE VOTE ALISON.

803
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:32,763
CHRISTIAN.

804
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,298
ONE VOTE ALISON.

805
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:39,703
ONE VOTE CHRISTIAN.

806
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:40,271
ALISON.

807
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:45,242
THATS TWO VOTES ALISON.

808
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:45,609
CHRISTIAN.

809
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,710
WERE TIED.

810
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:53,484
TWO VOTES ALISON, TWO VOTES
CHRISTIAN, ONE VOTE LEFT.

811
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:58,355
14th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

812
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,056
CHRISTIAN.

813
00:40:59,089 --> 00:40:59,990
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

814
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,826
WELL PLAYED, YOU GUYS.

815
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:02,493
LIKEWISE.

816
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:03,627
GOOD GAME, CHRISTIAN.

817
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,429
GREAT COMPETITOR.

818
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:16,440
GREAT GAME, CHRISTIAN.

819
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,878
Jeff: CHRISTIAN, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

820
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:21,479
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

821
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,013
GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL.

822
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:23,514
WELL PLAYED.

823
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,915
SORRY, CHRISTIAN.

824
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:32,089
BYE, CHRISTIAN.

825
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,999
Jeff: WELL, WITH ONLY A FEW
DAYS LEFT, AND THE GAME THIS

826
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,469
FLUID, FROM HEREON OUT, IT IS
GOING TO BE PEDAL TO THE METAL.

827
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,037
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

828
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:47,938
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

829
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:48,305
GOOD NIGHT.

830
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,274
DANG IT.

834
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,558
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

835
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:15,966
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
THE SEASON FINALE OF "SURVIVOR."

836
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,134
ONLY SIX ARE LEFT.

837
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,671
THEY LIED TRITE MY FACE,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

838
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,106
I MAY BE GOING HOME TODAY.

839
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:22,873
YEAH.

840
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,409
SHES LIKE A CRUEL
PSYCHOPATH.

841
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:30,714
Jeff: WHO WILL CLAIM THE
TITLE OF SOLE "SURVIVOR"?

842
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,116
JOIN US FOR THE FINALE,
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 19.

843
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:36,587
IT SURPRISES ME THAT PEOPLE
THOUGHT I WAS SUCH A HUGE THREAT

844
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,657
THAT I NEEDED TO GO AS SOON AS
THEY COULD MARSHAL THE VOTES.

845
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,991
18 VOTES, IF I CAN COUNT.

846
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,293
THATS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

847
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,527
IT MAKES ME FEEL BIG.

848
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,062
IT MAKES ME FEEL FORMIDABLE.

849
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:48,599
LIKE A PERSON WHO HAS EARNED
RESPECT OF HIS COLLEAGUES.

850
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,635
SO MAYBE I SHOULD RESPECT MYSELF
MORE AS A CONSEQUENCE.
