SHE'S AN OCEANFRONT LIFEGUARD.

107

SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST WOMEN
TO BE PUT ON A BEACH.

EVERY TIME SOMETHING COMES UP,
IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT SHE'S A

>> NO, I HAD A CHILDHOOD THAT
KIND OF WENT LIKE THIS.

127
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,487
I WOULD COME HOME IN HIGH
SCHOOL, CRY EVERY NIGHT AT TIME,

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,280
AN SHE WAS THERE.

129

LOOK AT THESE OTHER SURVIVORS.

284
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,215
ALL OF THEM FOUGHT FOR IT.

285
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,177
INVITE ONE OTHER SURVIVOR AND

THE GAME?

315
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,864
>> YES.

316
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,158
IT SUCKS TO FEEL THAT YOU'RE AT
THE BOTTOM AND IT SUCKS WHEN YOU

317
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:32,121
HAVE THAT MOMENT OF CLARITY, AND
I FEEL FOR ANYBODY WHO HAS THAT

318
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,748
MOMENT BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IT
FEELS.

319
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,500
MOVING FORWARD, LET'S ALL BAN
TOGETHER.

320
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,295
WE CAN PUT A WRECKING BALL TO
SOMEBODY ELSE'S HEAD MAYBE.

321
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,170
>> Jeff: WOW.

322
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,672
EMOTION
>> YEAH.

323
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,257

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,009
>> Jeff: ELAINE, DEAN,
KARISHMA, NOURA, GRAB YOUR

325
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,760
I GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

326
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,429
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

327
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:06,989
>> GUYS, I JUST WANT TO SAY, I
LOVE YOU GUYS.

328
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:12,494
>> TO WIN THE FAMILY VISIT, IT
WAS LIKE A SHOT OF ENERGY.

329
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:19,335
AND SEEING JOHN AND HOLDING HIM,
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.

330
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,169
HE'S MY ROCK.

331
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,006
YOU KNOW?

332
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,466
>> ISN'T IT CRAZY?

333
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,594
>> IT HAS NO IDEA.

334
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,597
>> SEEING NICOLE, I JUST
COULDN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT LOVE

335
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,973
AND FEEL THAT WARMTH OF HOME.

336
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,185
I BECAME ONE OF MY LITTLE FOURTH
GRADE GIRLS AND I EVEN STARTED

337
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:36,810
SHAKING.

338
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:41,357
THERE'S SO MUCH RIDING ON.

339
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,193
THIS IT'S MY JOB TO GET THIS
DONE.

340
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,280
>> LOVED ONE, WE DON'T WANT TO
TALK STRATEGY, BUT WE HAVE TO.

341
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:48,906
WHO IS FIRST?

342
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,200
>> I THINK ELAINE.

343
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,994
>> Jeff: I THINK ELAINE.

344
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,708
>> WHY DON'T WE TELL NOURA?

345
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,211
>> SPLIT THE VOTE BETWEEN
KARISHMA AND ELAINE?

346
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,547
>> ONCE AGAIN TO HAVE OUR ARMY
AGAINST THIS RAG-TAG GROUP OF

347
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,550
LOSERS.

348
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,552
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THIS WEIRD
GROUPING.

349
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,223
>> DAN, TOMMY, JANET, AND MYSELF
ARE IN AN ALLIANCE, AND THE

350
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,016
OTHER FOUR ARE BACK AT CAMP.

351
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,061
SO THEY HAVE THE CHANCE TO PUT A
PLAN TOGETHER.

352
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,231
HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOURA, WHO
ALWAYS TELLS EVERYONE I'M HER

353
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,693
NUMBER ONE, AND THEN THERE'S
ELAINE, WHO IS NOT A STRATEGIST.

354
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,154
AND WE HAVE DEAN, WHO IS A
NUMBERS GUY, WHO IS DESPERATE.

355
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:33,283
THEN WE HAVE KARISHMA, WHO
EVERYONE IS MAD AT.

356
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,369
DO THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS?

357
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:35,911
NO.

358
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,162
CAN THEY DO SOMETHING?

359
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:37,579
MAYBE.

360
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,747
IS IT LIKELY?

361
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,707
NO.

362
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,544
>> I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, AND
CAN WE TALK?

363
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,255
I'M THE ONLY VOKAI THAT'S HERE
WITH YOU DWOIS RIGHT NOW.

364
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,924
I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO THESE
PEOPLE SINCE THE BEGINNING.

365
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,801
I HAVE SHOWN MY ALLEGIANCE.

366
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,263
NOW I KNOW WHERE I RANK IN THAT
GROUP, I AM IN A WAY THE

367
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,641
KARISHMA, BUT I'M ACTUALLY
ENJOYABLE TO BE AROUND.

368
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,267
I'M FUNNY, I'M PROVIDING.

369
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,561
I'M CUTTING COCONUTS.

370
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,147
I GIVE UP REWARD SO THEY CAN EAT
AND KILL ME TODAY

371
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,107
>> YOU'RE THEIR BITCH.

372
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,275
>> I'M THEIR BITCH.

373
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:10,237
>> THIS FAMILY BUSINESS HAS
PEOPLE REVVED UP.

374
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,283
THE ONE WHO FELT IT THE MOIST IS
NOURA.

375
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,326
SHE CAME BACK GUNS ABLAZING.

376
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,411
>> I CAME OVER HERE.

377
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,081
I WAS WILLING TO BRING OUR
NUMBERS BACK TOGETHER, AND

378
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,292
LAUREN AND TOMMY FLIPPED OVER.

379
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,794
DAN, I WAS LIKE, WHERE'S THE
LOVE, MAN?

380
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,837
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS?

381
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,297
>> NOURA WAS VERY VOCAL ABOUT
HOW UPSET SHE WAS.

382
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,008
THERE WAS AIRING OF GRIEVANCES.

383
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:31,925
CALL IT FESTIVUS.

384
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,385
THERE WAS AN AIRING OF
GRIEVANCES GOING ON.

385
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,181
>> I AM HONEST AND LOYAL TO
FAULT, AND HERE'S THE FAULT.

386
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,641
HERE'S THE FAULT.

387
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,603
I WAS BLINDSIDED.

388
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,437
NOT BLINDSIDED.

389
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,609
IT BUNCHED -- PUNCHED ME IN THE
FACE.

390
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,735
KELLEE'S, I HAVE ALL THESE
PLANS.

391
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:56,033
AND LAUREN, SINCE DAY ONE, SHE
DOESN'T DO... THEY'RE EGO

392
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,159
MANIAC.

393
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,410
THEY WANT TO BE LIKE, LOOK WHAT
I DID, LOOK WHAT I DID?

394
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,622
NONE OF US WANT TO BE A PAWN IN
THEIR GAME AND BE SOMEONE WHO

395
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,248
GOT THEM TO THE END.

396
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,793
AND TODAY I'M GOING TO FAST
FORWARD TO THE FUTURE AND GO

397
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,337
BACK AND FINISH UP, FOR ME, IT
WAS WONDERFUL.

398
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,133
>> WHEN THERE'S A HIGH EMOTIONAL
MOMENT, PEOPLE TEND TO TELL THE

399
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,593
TRUTH.

400
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,386
WE CAN LITERALLY CONTROL THE
NEXT VOTE, BECAUSE I WILL BE

401
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,305
WITH YOU GUYS, AND I'M A VERY
TRANSPARENT PLAYER.

402
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:23,519
WITH ME, I TAKE PEOPLE TO INSANE
LEVELS.

403
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,897
I LITERALLY UPLIFT SOMEONE TO A
POINT WHERE HE'S ROCKING AND HE

404
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,691
GOES BACK TO HIS EX-AND I'M
DISPOSED OF EVEN THOUGH I GO

405
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,526
BACK TO HIM.

406
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,194
>> NOURA, YOU'RE GETTING SIDE
TRACKED.

407
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,488
>> THE POINT WHERE MY SURRENDER
FLAG.

408
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,198
I'M INCH I'M ALL THE WAY IN.

409
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:36,865
I'M NOT JUST SAYING.

410
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,075
THIS I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

411
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:38,909
I AM HERE WITH YOU.

412
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,577
I AM HERE WITH YOU, ELAINE.

413
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,913
I AM HERE WITH YOU, KARISHMA.

414
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,164
WE HAVE TO MAKE A MOVE.

415
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,001
THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE
THIS, DUH, DUH, DUH, DUH, DUH.

416
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,881
>> THAT WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS TO
SEE SOMEONE OF A GROUP I THOUGHT

417
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,132
WAS SO STRONG GO AGAINST THEM.

418
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,719
>> WHAT SCARES ME THE MOST IS
LAUREN HAS TOMMY WRAPPED AROUND

419
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,929
HER FINGER.

420
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,391
>> WE ALL KNOW LAUREN IS A BIG
THREAT BECAUSE SHE'S VERY SOCIAL

421
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,392
AND SHE'S MOST THREATENING IN MY
BOOK.

422
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,434
ARE YOU WILLING TO VOTE HER OUT?

423
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,728
>> YES, I AM.

424
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,938
BECAUSE I'M BEING PLAYED BY
THEM.

425
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,315
>> MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME TO
WAKE UP AND SAY, DAN AND TOMMY

426
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,861
DON'T HAVE YOU IN THEIR FINAL
PLAN, BECAUSE NOW WOULD BE MY

427
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:22,244
TIME TO HOP OFF THAT BUS AND GET
ON WITH THE UNDERLINGS AND RISE

428
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:22,744
ON UP.

429
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,954
>> WHAT CAN WE DO?

430
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,415
>> WHAT THAT SAID, THERE'S ONLY
FOUR OF US, AND THERE ARE FOUR

431
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:32,421
OTHER PEOPLE, SO WE DRAG IN A
FIFTH OR WE GO OUT AND FIND A

432
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,299
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND GO
CREATE OUR OWN LUCK.

433
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,302
>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE
BURIED.

434
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:45,767
I'M THINKING LIKE WE KNOW, AND I
KNOW AN IDOL IS BACK IN PLAY.

435
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,396
TWO WERE PLAYED, AT LEAST ONE,
WAS FOUND IN THIS JUNGLE.

436
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,440
>> WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

437
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,276
>> IT'S BLUE, THIS BIG.

438
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,072
>> THERE IS THE THING CALL THE
VERY TICK LAR ACTIVATING SYSTEM,

439
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,577
IF YOU SAY BLUE, BLUE, BLUE, IT
WILL ACTIVATE OUR BRAINS.

440
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,913
IF YOU SAY IT, WE'LL SEE IT.

441
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,499
I KNOW THESE IDOLS ARE LOOKING
THE HELP US.

442
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,792
>> THIS IS BLUE.

443
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,921
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO
DIG AND MAKE SO IT HARD.

444
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,798
IT'S GOING TO BE LITERALLY LIKE
A GIFT.

445
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:22,346
HERE YOU GO.

446
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,640
>> BOOM!

447
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:30,479
[SCREAMING]
>> YOU DID IT.

448
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:35,651
>> LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

449
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,443
I FOUND ONE.

450
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,236
THERE IT WAS, SITTING IN THE
TREE.

451
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,321
PRETTY AS CAN BE.

452
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,447
I PICKED IT UP AND PUT IT IN MY
RED NICK POCKET.

453
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,824
AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING TO
STAY UNTIL I PLAY THE DAMN

454
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,325
THING.

455
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,162
>> I SEE IT CLEARLY.

456
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:50,290
NOW I HAVE TO MAKE MY MOVE, AND
MY SISTER SAID IT, THIS IS MY

457
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,792
CRAZY NOURA.

458
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,627
SHE ALWAYS FINDS A WAY.

459
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,253
AND MY FAMILY KNOWS THAT.

460
00:20:55,337 --> 00:21:00,008
I AM THE EPITOME OF "SURVIVOR"
IN MY OWN LIFE BECAUSE THE

461
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,303
BIGGEST, THIS IS WHERE IT COMES
TO A CLOSE, THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE

462
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,680
IN MY LIFE HAS BEEN ME.

463
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,682
AM I GOING TO BE A SHEEP UNTIL
THE END?

464
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,182
I'M NOT.

465
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,558
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

466
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,395
AND THAT'S WHY THE GAME IS GOING
TO CHANGE TODAY.

467
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,188
>> LET'S OPEN A PAPAYA.

468
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,149
>> YES!

469
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:35,711
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

470
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,712
ALL RIGHT.

471
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,505
FIRST THINGS FIRST, GOT TO TAKE
BACK THE NECKLACE.

472
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,424
ONCE AGAIN, NOURA.

473
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,718
ARE YOU EVEN GOING TO TURN
AROUND?

474
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,096
>> NOW I WILL.

475
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,515
THANK YOU, JEFF.

476
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:53,186
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

477
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,272
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO STAND ON THE SMALL

478
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,900
BLOCK OF WOOD WHILE STABILIZING
A BALL AGAINST AN OVERHANGING

479
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,235
PIECE OF WOOD.

480
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,404
IF AT ANY POINT THE BALL DROPS,
YOU'RE OUT.

481
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,408
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN

482
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,453
SEVEN SHOT OF GETTING TO THE
END.

483
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,747
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT AND

484
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,708
BECOME THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF OUR
JURY.

485
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,001
DRAW FOR SPOTS.

486
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:23,633
WE'LL GET STARTED.

487
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,385
ALL RIGHT.

488
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,597
EVERYBODY GET ON ONE FOOT.

489
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,309
PUT THE BALL IN THE PAINT.

490
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:37,314
GRAB BOTH HANDLES.

491
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,565
AN WE LOOK GOOD.

492
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:43,612
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

493
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,615
AT THIS POINT EVERYBODY KNOWS
THE GAME IS UP FOR GRABS.

494
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,118
NOBODY CAN BE TOTALLY CERTAIN
THEY'RE OKAY.

495
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:55,624
BUT THAT NECKLACE SOLVES THAT
PROBLEM.

496
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,585
NOW SOONER DO I SAY THAT, DEAN
IS FIRST OUT.

497
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:02,589
NO SHOT AT IMHUNTTY.

498
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,298
TOMMY DROPS.

499
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,842
HE'LL HAVE NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

500
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:15,352
HE'S NOT SAFE AT TRIBAL.

501
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,311
NOURA DROPS.

502
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,854
SHE WILL NOT GET A THIRD
IMMUNITY¦ NECKLACE.

503
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,605
SHE'S OUT.

504
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:27,447
WE'RE DOWN THE FIVE.

505
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,824
JANET DROPS.

506
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,783
YOU ALL RIGHT?

507
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,492
>> YEAH.

508
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,618
>> Jeff: YOU SURE?

509
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:31,993
>> YEAH.

510
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,161
>> Jeff: OKAY.

511
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:43,338
JANET WITH HARD TUMBLE, BUT GETS
UP LIKE A WEEBLE WOBBLE.

512
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:51,179
JANET WITH HARD TUMBLE, BUT GETS
UP LIKE A WEEBLE WOBBLE.

513
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:51,680
KARISHMA DROPS.

514
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,722
SHE'S OUT.

515
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:59,187
KARISHMA HAS NO SECURITY AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

516
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:09,406
WE'RE DOWN TO LAUREN, DAN, AND
ELAINE FOR IMMUNITY ON DAY 32.

517
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,533
>> OH, GOD, I LOOKED AWAY.

518
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,534
I LOOKED AWAY.

519
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,034
I LOOKED AWAY.

520
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,703
>> Jeff: DAN DROPS.

521
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,537
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.

522
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,039
IT IS LAUREN VERSUS ELAINE FOR
IMMUNITY.

523
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,166
>> ELAINE!

524
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,376
>> Jeff: THIS IS IT, ANOTHER
SHOWDOWN ON "SURVIVOR" RIGHT

525
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:32,721
HERE.

526
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,723
COMING UP ON 15 MINUTES IN THIS
CHALLENGE.

527
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,517
>> I WANT THAT NECKLACE, JEFF.

528
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,727
>> Jeff: EARN IT RIGHT HERE.

529
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,190
>> KEEP YOUR FOCUS ON THE BALL.

530
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,901
>> Jeff: ELAINE KNOWS HOW GOOD
IT FEELS.

531
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,737
>> I WANT THAT NECKLACE.

532
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:59,289
>> FOCUS ON THE BALL.

533
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,165
>> Jeff: THAT'S IT.

534
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,625
YOU GOT THE BREATHE THROUGH IT
SOMETIMES.

535
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,168
>> KEEP FOCUSED.

536
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:03,627
YOU'RE GOOD.

537
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,753
YOU'RE BOTH GOOD.

538
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,590
>> Jeff: ELAINE STILL LOOKING
VERY GOOD DOWN ON THE END.

539
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:18,683
NOT MUCH MOVEMENT AT ALL.

540
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:24,606
NOT MUCH MOVEMENT AT ALL.

541
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:33,114
ELAINE STILL VERY SOLID.

542
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,157
>> MY ARMS.

543
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,618
>> Jeff: REST THEM AGAINST THE
BALL.

544
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,578
DON'T LOOK AWAY.

545
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,412
DON'T LOOK AWAY.

546
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,456
>> Jeff: LAUREN STARTING TO
STRUGGLE.

547
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,749
GOT TO GET IT BACK.

548
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,293
>> DO NOT LOOK AWAY.

549
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,005
THAT'S WHAT KILLED ME.

550
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,799
>> Jeff: LAUREN STRUGGLING
AGAIN.

551
00:25:50,882 --> 00:26:04,980
CAN SHE RECOVER FOR A SECOND
TIME?

552
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,816
ELAINE DROPS SUDDENLY.

553
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,359
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

554
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,363
>> Jeff: LAUREN WINS
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

555
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,197
>> I WON?

556
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,532
>> Jeff: YOU WON!

557
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,117
LAUREN PULLS IT OUT.

558
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,620
ONCE THAT BALL DROPPED, WE KNEW
OUR EASY TARGET TONIGHT,

559
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,330
KARISHMA, CAN GO HOME.

560
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,165
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

561
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,378
>> ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, BUT
EVERYONE WANTS HER OUT, AND

562
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,506
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT THAT CAN
GET THAT DONE.

563
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,773
>> Jeff:
>> LAUREN.

564
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,233
>> YOU DID REALLY GOOD.

565
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,901
YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD OF
YOURSELF.

566
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,777
>> THANK YOU.

567
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,822
>> I'M IS HAPPY TO HAVE THIS
NECKLACE ON.

568
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,867
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE
DREAMED OF DOING SINCE I WAS 11.

569
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,371
THAT IS 18 YEARS OF DREAMING, OF
HAVING THIS ON MY NECK.

570
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,539
AND I HAVE IT.

571
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,334
I DON'T KNOW IF I NEEDED IT
TONIGHT, BECAUSE I'M CONFIDENT

572
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,835
IN MY ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW.

573
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:12,339
BUT THIS VOTE IS ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT VOTES OF THE GAME.

574
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,506
>> OKAY.

575
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,216
SO THE IDEA FOR TONIGHT IS...

576
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:24,267
>> TOMMY, DEAN, ME AND YOU ARE
VOTING TOGETHER.

577
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:28,271
>> THE STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD
IS TO GET THE CAT WITH NINE

578
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,523
LIVES OUT, WHICH IS KARISHMA.

579
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:34,402
SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT FOUR VOTES
ON KARISHMA AND THREE VOTES ON

580
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,364
ELAINE IN CASE KARISHMA FOUND AN
IDOL AGAIN AN WE'RE FEELING

581
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,703
RELATIVELY CONFIDENT BECAUSE WE
DON'T FEEL LIKE THIS MOTLEY

582
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,122
ANTI-ALLIANCE HAS REALLY
ASSEMBLED THEIR FORCES IN ANY

583
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:50,543
REAL WAY.

584
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:56,216
>> LONG STORY SHORT, YOU, ME,
AND DAN ARE VOTING ELAINE.

585
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,261
AND THE REST ON KARISHMA.

586
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,513
>> THAT'S SMART.

587
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,724
>> JANET TOLD ME THEIR PLAN, BUT
AFTER THE LOVED ONES VISIT AND

588
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:10,063
NOT GETTING THE GO ON THE
REWARD, I FELT ON THE BOTTOM.

589
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,274
THEY'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER,
TOMMY, JANET, DAN, LAUREN,

590
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,734
THEY'RE A STRONG FOUR.

591
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,820
THIS IS LIKE LORD OF IF FLIES.

592
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,490
THEY CAN PROMISE YOU THE STARS
AND THE MOON, AND WINE AND DINE

593
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:24,285
YOU AND MAKE YOU FEEL GREAT, AND
THEN THEY'RE GOING TO FRICKING

594
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,453
GET YOU.

595
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,997
>> KARISHMA NEEDS TO GO BECAUSE
WE CAN'T KEEP DRAGGING HER

596
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,124
ALONG.

597
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,251
THE CLOSER SHE GETS TO THE END,
THE MORE WE'LL ALL START

598
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,503
THINKING WE WANT TO SIT NEXT TO
KARISHMA.

599
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,796
>> THIS IS A REALLY BIG VOTE.

600
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:40,135
BUT IT FEELS COOL THAT I GET SO
MUCH POWER IN IT.

601
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,136
>> OKAY.

602
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:41,928
THEY CAME UP TO ME.

603
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,304
IT WAS ME AND JANET.

604
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,432
THIS IS HOW THEY'RE DOING THE
VOTE.

605
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,476
JANET AND DAN ARE GOING ON YOU.

606
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,478
AND SHE HAS SOMETHING.

607
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,648
AND TOMMY AND LAUREN ARE DOING
KARISHMA.

608
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:57,610
>> PERFECT.

609
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:02,115
>> THAT MEANS THE FOUR OF US CAN
VOTE WHOEVER WE WANT.

610
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,324
>> THIS IS GOLD.

611
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,035
I KNOW THAT FOUR STILL WANT ME
OUT, BUT IF THEY DECIDE TO SPLIT

612
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,079
THE VOTE, THE FOUR OF US CAN
DECIDE WHO GOES HOME.

613
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,124
THIS IS THE BREAK I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR.

614
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:15,170
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE TRIBAL
COUNCIL FOR EVERYTHING TO

615
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,337
CHANGE.

616
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,466
IF THEY'RE DOING 2-2, WE HAVE TO
PUT OUR ENTIRE FOUR ON ONE

617
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,008
PERSON.

618
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,884
>> ALL FOUR ON TOMMY.

619
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,011
>> UNLESS YOU'RE TOLD DIFFERENT.

620
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,013
>> EVERYBODY IS VOTING FOR
TOMMY.

621
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,639
>> OKAY.

622
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,182
GREAT.

623
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,225
>> NOURA, FINAL FOUR.

624
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,518
>> WE'RE DOING IT.

625
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,688
>> WE WANTED TO VOTE LAUREN OUT
TODAY, BUT SHE WON IMMUNITY, SO

626
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,857
THE BACKUP IS TOMMY, BECAUSE
THAT'S HER RIGHT-HAND MAN.

627
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,066
IT'S GOING TO WORK.

628
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,863
MY CONCERN IS THAT NOURA IS SUCH
A FRUIT LOOP THAT SHE WON'T

629
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:46,493
STICK TO THE PLAN.

630
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:51,539
>> ME, DAN, AND JANET VOTING
ELAINE, AND YOU AND ELAINE AND

631
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:57,587
EVERYONE ELSE KARISHMA SOME THAT
MAKES TECHNICALLY ONLY 2-2.

632
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,882
>> BUT WHAT IF TOMMY HAS AN
IDOL.

633
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,218
WHAT IF 3-1
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

634
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,552
>> YOU DON'T THINK SO?

635
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,846
>> ONE VOTE IS NOT DOING
ANYTHING.

636
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,389
>> WELL, DUH.

637
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,057
BUT THEN WHAT IF KARISHMA GOES?

638
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,267
>> KARISHMA IS NOT GOING.

639
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,894
>> BUT WHAT IF ELAINE DOESN'T
PLAY IT?

640
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,230
>> GOOD.

641
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,067
>> LOOK, WE FOUND THE IDOL.

642
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,611
YOU THINK THERE'S TWONé
THAT'S ABSURD.

643
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,530
WE CAN'T PLAN FOR EVERY LITTLE
THING.

644
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,906
THAT'S WHEN WE START GOING
CRAZY.

645
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:25,740
>> I AGREE.

646
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,575
SO I WANT THE RULE THIS OUT IN
MY MIND.

647
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,744
SO IF WE --
>> HOLY CRAP.

648
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,079
NOURA IS TOTALLY CONFUSED.

649
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,122
SHE CAN'T EVEN THINK THROUGH
NUMBERS STRAIGHT.

650
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,918
LIKE, NOURA, IT'S EASY.

651
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,586
TWO IS MORE THAN ONE, BUT NO.

652
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,382
>> WHAT IF WE DID THREE ON TOMMY
AND ONE LET'S SAY DAN.

653
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,967
>> WE WOULD DO 2-2-1.

654
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,180
>> WELL, ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE
THINKING IT HAS TO BE ALL TOMMY.

655
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,098
>> FOUR TOMMY.

656
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,766
>> AND WE HAVE TO TRUST
EVERYBODY.

657
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:52,600
>> I DO.

658
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,602
>> YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT
KARISHMA?

659
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,604
>> I FEEL VERY GOOD.

660
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,105
I AM MOST WORRIED ABOUT YOU?

661
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,940
>> REALLY?

662
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,566
>> YEAH.

663
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,442
>> NOURA IS A LOOSE CANNON.

664
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,779
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PLAN, BUT THE
WAY SHE WAS THINKING THROUGH

665
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:07,240
THINGS, PUTTING MY FAITH IN
NOURA'S HANDS IS SCARY.

666
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,449
>> OKAY.

667
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,619
I'M SITTING IN THE MIDDLE AND WE
HAVE BEEN TOLD TO VOTE LIKE

668
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,330
THIS.

669
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:23,131
KARISHMA, KARISHMA, KARISHMA,
KARISHMA.

670
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,301
NOURA.

671
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,971
>> IF NOURA ISN'T WITH US RIGHT
NOW --

672
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:30,388
>> IF NOURA FLIPS.

673
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,306
THEY HAVE FOUR.

674
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,808
AND THAT MEANS WHOEVER THEY PICK
GOES HOME.

675
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:34,976
>> RIGHT.

676
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,105
>> IF WE GET THROUGH TONIGHT
WITH KARISHMA OR ELAINE GOING

677
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,273
HOME, WE'RE SITTING PRETTY.

678
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:44,819
BUT THE ONE THING THAT COULD
REALLY MESS THAT UP WAS NOURA.

679
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:47,155
NOURA HAS BEEN A WILD CARD SINCE
DAY ONE.

680
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,158
SHE'S VERY LIKE SPUR OF THE
MOMENT, GOES WITH THE FLOW, AND

681
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,661
IF SHE DOES SOMETHING CRAZY, I
DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.

682
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,164
I DON'T HAVE A NECKLACE.

683
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,667
I COULD BE GOING HOME.

684
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,712
>> SO WHAT DO WE DO FOR REAL?

685
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,839
>>
>> WE DEFINITELY WANT KARISHMA.

686
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,507
>> BUT NOW IS JUST CRAZY.

687
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,508
>> IT'S A TRICKY SITUATION.

688
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,721
AND ALL IT TAKES IS ONE LITTLE
WRONG DECISION.

689
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,305
AND IT'S OVER.

690
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,181
YOUR DREAM IS DEAD.

691
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,643
>> IF WE DO THIS, THERE'S NO
TURNING BACK.

692
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,061
>> I GOT AN IDOL IN MY POCKET.

693
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,063
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD PLAY
IT, BUT MY LESSON FROM BOSTON

694
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,523
ROB AND SANDRA WAS DON'T
HESITATE.

695
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,400
WHEN YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY,
SEIZE IT.

696
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,321
I'M GOING TO GO BALLS OUT AND
SEE IF I CAN MAKE THIS MOVE.

697
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,407
GO BIG OR GO HOME.

698
00:32:52,470 --> 00:33:03,064
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

699
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,232
ALL RIGHT.

700
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,067
SO LET'S START WITH THE LOVED
ONE CHALLENGE.

701
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,237
JANUARYET, WHEN YOU DREAM OF
PLAYING "SURVIVOR," ONE OF THE

702
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,323
MOMENTS YOU THINK ABOUT IS, AND
THEN I'LL BE THERE LONG ENOUGH

703
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,409
FOR MY LOVED ONE TO GET.

704
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,410
THERE YOU HAD THAT MOMENT.

705
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,286
>> IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

706
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,624
THE BEST PART WAS LIKE ENERGY
THAT JUST FILLS YOU UP.

707
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:26,713
>> Jeff: KARISHMA, THE DOWN
SIDE OF WINNING THE LOVED ONE

708
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,632
REWARD CHALLENGE IS YOU ARE
PLAYING WITH "SURVIVOR"

709
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,174
DYNAMITE.

710
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,093
YOU WIN, YOU GET LOVE.

711
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,428
YOU LIVE PEOPLE BEHIND THAT
DON'T.

712
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,763
>> YEAH, IT IS DEFINITELY
"SURVIVOR" DYNAMITE.

713
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:41,436
I MEAN, THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE LEFT
BACK AT CAMP ALL SHARING THE

714
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,105
MISERY OF HEARTBREAK AND MISERY
LOVES COMPANY, SO THAT COULD BE

715
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:51,320
THE DYNAMITE THAT EXPLODES IN
SOMEONE'S FACE.

716
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,449
>> Jeff: LAIRNG LET'S
EXTRAPOLATE.

717
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,117
>> WHAT'S EXTRAPOLATE MEAN?

718
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,160
>> YOU WANT A CONSISTENT GAME
PLAN.

719
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,954
>> THIS IS HOW I PLAYED THE
GAME.

720
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:00,913
FROM START TO FINISH.

721
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,123
I HAD A GOAL.

722
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,124
AND THIS IS WHAT I DID.

723
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:08,296
IF IT SERVED ME WELL GREAT, IF
IT DIDN'T, GREAT.

724
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,591
>> Jeff: ELAINE RUSSIA YOU
CONCERNED AT ALL THAT SINCE WE

725
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,134
SAT DOWN, IT'S BEEN WHISPERING.

726
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:23,269
>> APPARENTLY THEY GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY.

727
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,522
>> LOOK AT THIS.

728
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,150
>> TOMMY, TOMMY, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

729
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,987
I'M SORRY.

730
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,991
>> TO BE ON THE BOTTOM, THEY'RE
TRYING TO BRING YOU IN AND VOTE

731
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,160
YOU OUT.

732
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,369
>> I KNOW.

733
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,790
I'M SORRY.

734
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,293
LISTEN,
>> ARE YOU VOTING FOR ME.

735
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,294
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

736
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,880
>> I'LL BE OUTSPOKEN.

737
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,089
I'LL SAY IT RIGHT NOW.

738
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,676
I'LL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR AND THEN
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL THIS

739
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,928
WHISPERING.

740
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,347
DEAN, SINCE THE DAY I MET YOU AT
LIAR YORK YOU'VE SHOWN ME NOT

741
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,349
ONCE, NOT TWICE, THREE TIMES I
CAN'T TRUST YOU.

742
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:06,020
LOOK, DEAN, ELAINE, AND
KARISHMA, THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM,

743
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,856
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET IN WITH
OUR GROUP, AND I WOULD ACTUALLY

744
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,150
CONSIDER LEAVING MY CREW TO GO
WITH YOU?

745
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,194
YOU'RE TELLING ME COME WITH US,
LET'S DO THIS RUSE?

746
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,864
NOW IT'S 110% NEVER.

747
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,365
>> BUT WHAT IS THE RUSE?

748
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,241
WHAT IS THE RUSE?

749
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,368
>> WHAT WAS THE PLAN?

750
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,371
>> THE PLAN WAS ALL THREE OF
THEM ARE GOING TO VOTE TOMMY AND

751
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,372
ELAINE HAS AN IDOL.

752
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,374
THERE YOU GO.

753
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,375
>> OUT OF CONTROL.

754
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,711
>> WHY DID YOU TELL ME THEY
WOULD VOTE MY NAME?

755
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,380
>> IT'S TRUE, BECAUSE AFTER
KARISHMA --

756
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,715
>> SO WHY ARE YOU ALL VOTING MY
NAME?

757
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,092
>> YOU WASN'T.

758
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,051
TOMMY WASN'T WRITING MY NAME.

759
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:40,680
>> EXACTLY.

760
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,432
>> ELAINE, YOU THINK THE SPLIT
IS WHAT MATTERS.

761
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,393
>> YOU ALL WAS COMING AFTER ME.

762
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,520
YOU WERE SPLITTING THE VOTE.

763
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,521
THAT'S WHAT NOURA TOLD ME.

764
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,232
>> WHY WOULD YOU BELIEVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

765
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,484
>> BECAUSE YOU ALL CAME BACK FOR
THE FAMILY THING AND YOU WERE

766
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,444
ACTING SKETCHY.

767
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,197
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

768
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,408
>> IF DEAN DIDN'T TELL ME, I
WOULD HAVE WENT HOME.

769
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,952
>> I WAS SPRAYING THIS OUT.

770
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:07,999
AND HE DIDN'T --
>> BUT HE DID.

771
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,334
>> IF HE DIDN'T SAY IT, I WOULD
HAVE WENT HOME.

772
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,503
>> I WAS GOING TO PULL YOU
ACROSS HERE.

773
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,797
HE GOT TO IT FIRST.

774
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,090
HE'S SITTING NEXT TO YOU.

775
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:18,801
>> BEFORE TRIBAL SHE WAS WITH US
100%.

776
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,802
>> SHE WAS.

777
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,387
>> AND YOU THREE --
>> WE VOTE AND YOU WOULD BE

778
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:21,888
FINE.

779
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,431
>> SHE HAS AN IDOL.

780
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,057
I'M TELLING YOU.

781
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,434
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW.

782
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,062
>> NOURA, WERE YOU CONSIDERING
WRITING TOMMY'S NAME DOWN?

783
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:30,980
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO KNOW?

784
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,107
>> WHEN THEY PRESENTED IT, YOU
CONSIDER IT.

785
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,108
>> OKAY.

786
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,067
>> GIVE ME A SECOND.

787
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,944
>> NOURA GOT CAUGHT IN A LIE.

788
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,779
SHE'S TRYING TO TALK HER WAY OUT
OF IT.

789
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,447
>> ALL RIGHT.

790
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,531
IT'S FINE.

791
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,950
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO -- ALL DAY
LONG SHE'S WITH US.

792
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,910
USE LOGIC.

793
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,453
JUST USE LOGIC.

794
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,582
>> NOURA IS A LIAR.

795
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,375
>> DAN, I'M TELLING YOU THE
TRUTH.

796
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,629
ALL I WANT TO DO IS GET TOLL
TRIBAL.

797
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,504
>> WHEN HAVE YOU NOT TRUSTED ME.

798
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,424
>> I HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED ME.

799
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,468
>> I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU RIGHT
NOW THIS IS WHAT'S UP.

800
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,385
>> WHY?

801
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,972
>> THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
THE SITUATION.

802
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,641
>> NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

803
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,977
NOW I'M SEEING IT.

804
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,354
>> I'M NOT WRITING YOUR NAME.

805
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,522
>> LAUREN, PUT LAUREN.

806
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:13,814
>> I AM.

807
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,941
>> OKAY.

808
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,192
>> I AM.

809
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,444
>> HOW MANY TIMES SOMEBODY LIES
TO YOU AND THEN YOU LET THEM GET

810
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,197
AWAY WITH IT AND YOU GIVE THEM A
SECOND CHANCE?

811
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,864
ONE TIME.

812
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,533
IF YOU GET CAUGHT, THAT'S IT.

813
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,952
>> YEAH.

814
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,956
YEAH.

815
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:38,464
>>
>> WE'RE GOOD.

816
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,050
>> I NEVER DOUBTED IT.

817
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:41,467
>> OKEY-DOKEY.

818
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,845
>> DAMN, JEFF.

819
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,348
>> Jeff: NOURA, NOW THAT
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS STEPPED DOWN,

820
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,517
HOW ARE YOU FEELING AS THE ONE
WHO INSTIGATED THIS?

821
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,979
>> I WILL SAY THIS, I DID NOT
INSTIGATE THIS.

822
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,690
ACTUALLY DEAN DID WHEN HE
STARTED TALKING TO TOMMY AND

823
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,816
SMILING AT HIM.

824
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,069
HE'S LAUGHING, DEAN, DON'T LOOK
AT PRETTY DEAN.

825
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,697
HE WANTS THE LURE YOU IN WITH
HIS PRETTY FACE, BUT HE'S FULL

826
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,365
OF IT.

827
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,866
I'M JUST SPEAKING MY TRUTH.

828
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,576
I'M SORRY.

829
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:13,541
>> JEFF, YOU GOT TO TELL PEOPLE
WHEN THEY NEED TO KNOW THINGS.

830
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,377
A LESSON IS LEARNED.

831
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,213
>> Jeff: ARE WE READY TO VOTE?

832
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,339
>> YES.

833
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:20,840
>> LET'S DO IT.

834
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,717
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

835
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,592
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

836
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:27,471
JANET, YOU'RE UP.

837
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,442
>> I KNEW WE COULDN'T TRUST HER.

838
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:52,747
I KNEW WE COULDN'T TRUST HER.

839
00:38:52,830 --> 00:39:03,257
>> OH, MY GOSH.

840
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:11,891
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

841
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,435
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

842
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:26,655
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

843
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,491
>> I'LL PLAY IT FOR MYSELF.

844
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:36,916
SORRY IF IT SMELLS LIKE FEET.

845
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,667
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

846
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:44,465
ANY VOTES CAST FOR ELAINE WILL
NOT COUNT.

847
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,634
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

848
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:51,680
FIRST VOLT, KARISHMA.

ONE VOTE KARISHMA, ONE VOTE

851
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:57,812
NOURA.

852
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,646
TWO VOTES NOURA.

853
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:02,274
>> DAMN, NOURA, THEY SCREWED
YOU.

854
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,444
>> SHE SCREWED HERSELF.

855
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:12,868
>> Jeff: THREE VOTES NOURA.

856
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,828

THAT'S THREE VOTES NOURA, TWO

863
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,679
LEFT.

864
