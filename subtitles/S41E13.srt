1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:05,138
From day one,
the pace has been relentless.

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,241
They've survived
on very little food.

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,275
They've had to navigate
the most dangerous twist

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,910
we've ever put in the game.

5
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,813
They're on fumes,
but this is<i> Survivor,</i>

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,951
and every epic battle needs
that one final push.

7
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,386
This is the beginning of theirs.

8
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,954
Once again,
they're starting over--

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,757
new island, no food, no shelter.

10
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:27,227
There will be two immunity
challenges, two Tribal Councils,

11
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:31,931
one fire-making showdown,
and we have one last twist

12
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,068
that they will never see coming.

13
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:40,106
For the first time since the
summer of 2000-- 21 years ago--

14
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,675
we're gonna read the votes
and announce the winner

15
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,711
of<i> Survivor</i>
right here on location.

16
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,479
Then we're going to do
a<i> Survivor</i> after show

17
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,548
and keep everybody there
to talk about the season

18
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:52,018
while they're still
in that authentic raw state.

19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,120
There they are,
the final five--

20
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,224
Deshawn, Xander, Erika,
Ricard and Heather.

21
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,126
Three of them will get
to the end and have a chance

22
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,062
to plead their case about why
they deserve the title

23
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,466
of Sole Survivor and the million
dollars that goes along with it.

331
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:27,499
Erika with that big advantage of
having her first four rope rungs

332
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,602
already up there,
but here comes Ricard.

333
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,670
Now Xander.

334
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,173
♪ ♪

335
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,874
Heather's got all seven down.

336
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,409
Now she's got to collect them.

337
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,411
Deshawn working on his last two.

338
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,282
Once you build that, Erika,
get on up and start working

339
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,950
on your second ladder.

340
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,519
It's Ricard
with another rope rung,

341
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,954
Xander with another rope rung.

342
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:52,591
And another advantage for Erika.
The first four rungs

343
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,394
of her second ladder are
also already completed.

344
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,162
Here comes Deshawn,

345
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,964
and here comes Heather.
We got a challenge.

346
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:05,137
It is Erika all alone up here
on the second stage.

347
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,074
Xander has got to go back.

348
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,343
He is one rung short.

349
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,880
He left one hanging,
a potentially fatal mistake

350
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,849
on day 24 and final five.

351
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:21,253
Now Xander's got to really work
to get back in this.

352
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,222
Here comes Ricard.
He has won three

353
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,292
individual immunity challenges.
Love to win a fourth.

354
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,893
Erika is whipping through this.

355
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,563
She will get
to the puzzle first.

356
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,232
Question is,
will her advantage be enough?

357
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,069
It's Erika up top. She can start
working on that puzzle.

358
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,739
Xander made quick work of that
mistake. He's back in it now.

359
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,943
Here comes Deshawn.
Everybody moving.

360
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,379
Erika all alone working
on that puzzle.

361
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,182
Ricard trying to get up here.
Ricard's good.

362
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,084
Heather now reaching
the second stage.

363
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,486
That-away, Heather.
Represent.

364
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:58,057
Kids will be proud
watching Mom push through.

365
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,826
Deshawn is up.
There, he's got it.

366
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,662
Xander right on that last piece.
Xander has his.

367
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,931
It is a mighty big puzzle
so you want to get here

368
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,800
'cause you will be in it.

369
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,141
Heather has hers. Heather now
going to be in on the puzzle.

370
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,511
All five now working
on the puzzle.

371
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,184
It is Heather, Ricard, Erika,

372
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,854
Deshawn and Xander fighting to
stay in a million-dollar game.

373
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,690
You win this challenge,
you are guaranteed

374
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,692
a spot in the final four.

375
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,160
This is a huge challenge to win.

376
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:40,699
PROBST: Erika has been on fire
this entire challenge.

377
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,634
She earned an advantage
this morning.

378
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,403
She put that advantage
to quick work,

379
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,972
and she has been attacking
the puzzle.

380
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,108
Right next to her is Ricard

381
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,343
working equally fast,
trying to catch up.

382
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,113
Deshawn is fighting
to stay in this.

383
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,883
Xander taking a different
approach-- building

384
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,451
his puzzle vertically.

385
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,788
Heather has a lot of pieces
in the puzzle area,

386
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,823
-but very few
of them are together.
-Very few.

387
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,192
PROBST:
You got to stay focused
on your game

388
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,827
and hope
that somebody hits a roadblock

389
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,130
because it happens,
they get stuck.

390
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,465
Or there's one piece
in the wrong spot.

391
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,369
Erika with another piece.
She can see it coming together.

392
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,272
Xander's now
put his puzzle flat,

393
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,908
and now we can see his progress.
It's pretty good.

394
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,912
Everybody's in it right now,
except for Heather.

395
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,114
Ricard with another piece
and another piece

396
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,582
and another piece.

397
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,419
Erika with another piece.
The pace has picked up.

398
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:37,156
It's Erika and Ricard
side by side right now.

399
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,826
Erika's still in the lead, but
Ricard is making a go of it.

400
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,363
Erika with another piece, Ricard
trying to put another piece.

401
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,766
Erika is down
to a handful of pieces.

402
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,068
Erika down to two pieces left.

403
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,504
-For the win.
-Jeff, Jeff!

404
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,341
Erika wins individual immunity,

405
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,211
guaranteed a spot
in the final four.

406
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,483
Thanks, guys. Oh, my God,
if I didn't win this one,

407
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,352
I would have died. (laughs)

408
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,955
Erika, come on over.

409
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,523
Thanks, Jeff.

410
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,759
-Still a dream come true.
-Yeah?

411
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,829
What a day for you.
You start the morning

412
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,430
by earning an advantage.

413
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,766
Then you put that advantage
to the best use you can

414
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,768
by winning today's challenge.

415
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,869
You are guaranteed a spot
in the final four,

416
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,305
which means, at the very least,

417
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,408
you get a chance
to make fire to get to three.

418
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,709
This is a big spot to be in.

419
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,846
In addition,
you've won steak,

420
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,414
veggies, bread and wine

421
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,317
-back at camp... for two.
-Wow. Wow.

422
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,219
-Oh, my gosh,
-You have a big decision

423
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,622
because you are either
gonna choose somebody

424
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,591
who you are wining
and dining before

425
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,961
you send them to the jury,
hoping to buy a vote, or

426
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,362
you are fueling
your competition,

427
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,031
hoping to buy some loyalty.

428
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,933
Who is going to join you
for this meal?

429
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,969
I mean, we had a tough
Tribal Council,

430
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,437
so I have to pick Heather.

431
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,972
-PROBST: Heather.
-ERIKA: Yeah.

432
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,840

-Thank you.

433
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,911
Love you, Mama.

434
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,313
All right, afternoon meal
for you two.

435
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,548
-Thank you.
-Congratulations. You are safe

436
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,749
and guaranteed a spot
in the final four.

437
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,919
As for the rest of you,

one of your dreams
of winning<i> Survivor 41</i>

Grab your stuff.

Head back. See you tonight
at Tribal. Congrats.

441

00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,333
than Deshawn win
and play into Deshawn's game.

501
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,835
We can't go with Deshawn.
We can't go with Deshawn.

502
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,171
And I'm pissed at Deshawn.

503
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,272
I am, too.

504
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,274
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>It's almost poetic</i>

505
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,709
how Heather and I have grown

506
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,611
<i>from people</i>
<i>that were disregarded</i>

507
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,080
<i>to people who are now</i>
<i>calling the shots.</i>

508
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,114
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

509
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,349
-Love you.
-Ditto.

510
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,718
I don't mind
being a little tipsy for Tribal.

511
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,321
<i>Tonight, Xander is safe</i>
<i>because he has an idol,</i>

512
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,656
<i>and tonight would be</i>
<i>the last opportunity</i>

513
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,657
<i>for Xander to play it.</i>

514
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,693
Nice.

515
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,995
So, the chopping block
is between Ricard,

516
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,130
<i>someone who I really respect,</i>

517
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,166
<i>but who I think</i>
<i>could beat me in the end,</i>

518
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:18,170
<i>versus Deshawn, who is someone</i>
<i>who really pissed me off.</i>

519
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,538
What's your plan?

520
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,173
We're just writing down
each other's names?

521
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,408
See who wins?

522
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,043
Guess that's all we can do.

523
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,880
I have to write your name down,
after all that... (chuckles)

524
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,015
So I'm sorry.

525
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,016
<i>Ricard's a big threat.</i>

526
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,752
<i>I've said it about 3,000 times.</i>

527
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,554
I have no more saliva left
in my mouth

528
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,556
to speak about Ricard
and how big of a threat he is.

529
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,991
-Oh.
-We had a good time.

530
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,327
-I'm happy for y'all.
<i>-We're at five.</i>

531
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,595
<i>There's no loyalty.</i>

532
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,830
<i>It's who can you beat</i>
<i>at the end,</i>

533
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,264
<i>and Ricard's</i>
<i>not one of those people.</i>

534
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,600
And if they decide
to vote me out, shame on them,

535
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,402
because they're not gonna win
at the end.

536
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,504
-Okay, when this...
-Oh!

537
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,072
(Erika gasps)

538
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,907
Ah!

539
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,042
Oh, my God.

540
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,712
Well, we're voting
for each other.

541
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,447
You and Deshawn
are voting for each other?

542
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,982
-Right.
-Yeah. Um...

543
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,083
So, what are you...

544
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,720
-You can be honest with me.
-Yeah.

545
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,689
Am I going home?
Do you think?

546
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,059
I don't know. I mean,
I think it's pretty clear

547
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,661
-I hate Deshawn.
-Mm-hmm.

548
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,796
I don't know.

549
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,498
<i>RICARD:</i>
<i>It floored me.</i>

550
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,667
<i>I'm reading Erika's face</i>
<i>and reading the fact</i>

551
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,935
that she's saying
she's conflicted,

552
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,303
and she doesn't know
what she's gonna do--

553
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,838
which shouldn't be the case
at all.

554
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,508
You've been, like,
a badass ally,

555
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,343
but it's, like, I'm sure
you can appreciate it,

556
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,778
it's, like,
a rough decision for us.

557
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:33,779
Yeah.

558
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,780
<i>What?</i>

559
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,181
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

560
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,151
<i>Deshawn tore her apart</i>
<i>at Tribal yesterday,</i>

561
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,420
but she's saying
she's on the fence.

562
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,256
<i>It makes me sick to my stomach.</i>

563
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,926
<i>I'm a day and a half away</i>
<i>from winning.</i>

564
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,361
I don't want to leave this game.

565
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,428
I am not giving up.

566
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,329
I'm not at all.

567
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,731
I'm still gonna throw out

568
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,699
all the little things I can,
which I've been doing.

569
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,768
So, what do you think?

570
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,938
I love Deshawn,
but I think he's a liability.

571
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,973
But, you know,
you're a huge threat.

572
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,075
I think you'll win
if you go to the end.

573
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,044
But I feel like
Deshawn's gonna win this.

574
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,950
You can promise it by voting
him out tonight, Heather.

575
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,251
(both chuckle)

576
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,386
What's wrong with you?

577
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,555
I'm hearing you,
but it is complicated.

578
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,156
-I really could see it
going either way.
-Yeah.

579
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,125
I assume you will vote with me.

580
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,660
-Yeah.
-And...

581
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,495
because he really, like,
screwed her over last night.

582
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,363
She's-she's angry at him. Yeah.

583
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,699
I'm sure you can understand
the dilemma I face.

584
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:28,800
One thousand percent.

585
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,936
In my head,
I know what I should do,

586
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,138
but it's also, like, hard,
'cause it's, like...

587
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,573
a trusted ally.

588
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,909
You wouldn't be fully to blame
to vote me out,

589
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,444
because of how
you feel like I did you,

590
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,745
but, at the end of the day,

591
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,681
you have a better chance
against me than him.

592
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,283
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>Of course, it makes sense</i>
<i>to get rid of Ricard tonight.</i>

593
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,752
<i>He's, by far, the biggest threat</i>
<i>to win the game.</i>

594
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,323
<i>Deshawn is definitely not</i>
<i>as big of a threat to win,</i>

595
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,691
<i>but, after last Tribal Council,</i>

596
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,459
I just can't trust Deshawn.

597
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,161
If I win
the last immunity challenge,

598
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,462
-I will bring you to the end.
-Okay.

599
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,830
And that's the truth.

600
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,565
If you win tomorrow,
who are you gonna take with you?

601
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,667
If you save me,

602
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,537
I told you this entire time
I was gonna take you.

603
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,372
I've never been able
to work with him.

604
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,675
<i>He always just throws</i>
<i>unnecessary fireworks.</i>

605
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,912
Someone like that doesn't really
deserve to go farther,

606
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:14,980
in my opinion.

607
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,848
Did you say...

608
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,450
<i>did they say</i>
<i>they're voting Deshawn?</i>

609
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,952
<i>RICARD:</i>
<i>I think they are</i>
<i>kind of on the fence.</i>

<i>No matter what happens, man,</i>

611
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,624
three more days,
and we get to see our families.

612
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,426
Am I still gonna get to visit
as Uncle Xander?

613
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,295
Two babies.

614
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,031
Two babies?

615
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,135
No way.

616
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,338
Oh, my God.

617
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,277
-Congratulations, man.
-Thanks.

618
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,879
Little boy.

619
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,814
That's so cool.

620
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,049
Yeah.

621
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,150
(sniffles)

622
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,190
So, I mean, he could already
be here, I don't know,

623
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,459
but I'm excited to find out.

624
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,629
<i>I gave up a lot to be here--</i>
<i>which everybody does--</i>

625
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,033
but I gave up, like, a life
moment, potentially, to be here.

626
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,401
Like, a huge one.

627
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,671
The first moment of
my baby's life to win this game.

628
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,774
I wanted to make it worth it
coming out here.

629
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,142
You did. I mean...

630
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,677
Yeah, I do. I think I did.

631
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,912
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>Ricard's an obvious vote.</i>

632
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,447
<i>He's the big threat here,</i>

633
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,850
but we've developed this really
strong bond over the game,

634
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,619
and it does tug
at my heartstrings.

635
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,555
<i>I-I really just hate to see him</i>
<i>in such pain.</i>

636
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,257
-Like...
-Still a chance I'm staying.

637
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,658
Yeah.

638
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,927
<i>I'm definitely debating,</i>

639
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,063
you know, whether
I want to stick with my heart

640
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,199
<i>and keep the guy who I love</i>
<i>around.</i>

641
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,268
<i>And if everybody's voting</i>
<i>for Ricard,</i>

642
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,638
then I'm the only
one that can save him.

643
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,674
You look intense.

644
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,711
'Cause it's, like...

645
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,014
I could save you with the idol.

646
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,916
That would...

647
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,684
They would lose their minds.

648
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,953
-Can you imagine?
They'd be so shocked.
-I know.

649
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,756
<i>I don't want to go home</i>
<i>with a souvenir,</i>

650
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,825
so I'll probably play it anyway,

651
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,893
but there's a possibility
that I could

652
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,030
<i>really change up the game</i>
<i>by playing it for Ricard.</i>

653
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,466
<i>Keep Ricard, because</i>
<i>he's someone that's loyal to me.</i>

654
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,401
If anything,
that would make it look like

655
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,136
I'm the one
controlling the vote.

656
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,205
You would put another thing
on your resume.

657
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,107
(chuckles)
Using your idol on somebody.

658
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,075
The most important thing
to know is that, like,

659
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,477
you know,
I'm still undecided right now.

660
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,911
-Of course.
-Right, like,

661
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,680
I just got to figure out
what's best for my game, and...

662
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:33,485
<i>Going into tonight's Tribal,</i>
<i>if I want to save him, I can,</i>

663
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,353
and I think
it would make a big statement.

664
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,357
As long as you're not
changing your mind on me.

665
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,060
But do I want to make

666
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,795
<i>that million-dollar gamble</i>
<i>that I would beat him</i>

667

All right. So, Deshawn,

676
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,141
last Tribal Council,

677
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,210
you said,
"Need to take out Ricard.

678
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,411
Keeps winning."

679
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,247
Today, Erika wins,
and Ricard's vulnerable.

680
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,515
So were you at camp going,

681
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,150
"We got to
take out Ricard,

682
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,785
'cause he's gonna keep winning"?

683
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,088
Um, I mean, so that was the
premise of last Tribal Council,

684
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,023
to kind of plant that seed.

685
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,658
So, I didn't have
to say a lot of that.

686
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,960
I think everybody here was kind
of on the same page with that,

687
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,628
and because
the seed was already planted.

688
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:54,466
Xander,
that feels like it's done,

689
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:55,700
according to Deshawn.

690
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,901
Uh, I don't know about that.

691
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,170
I can attest to the fact
that I was sitting

692
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,739
in the middle
of Deshawn and Ricard,

693
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:05,009
and it felt a lot like
high noon in the Wild West.

694
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,444
And, you know, draw.

695
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,846
I was like the tumbleweed

696
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,715
bouncing awkwardly
in the middle,

697
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,250
and they both know
they're on the chopping block

698
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,418
for different reasons,

699
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,220
so they were
gunning for each other.

700
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,989
So, Heather, Xander
describes it as high noon,

701
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,591
the Wild, Wild West.

702
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,726
-Were you open to hearing
both their stories?
-Oh, absolutely.

703
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,261
I'm open to listening
to everything.

704
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,831
I mean, the more information you
have, the more choices. Yeah.

705
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,366
PROBST:
How about you, Erika?

706
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,502
Yeah, we're at that point in
the game now where it's, like,

707
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,671
things that normally would be
a compliment in real life,

708
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,874
like, oh,
someone is a trusted ally,

709
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,277
could be, like,
a bad thing on<i> Survivor.</i>

710
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,379
And things that could be
a bad thing in real life,

711
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,181
like somebody cannot be trusted,

712
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,416
could be a good thing
on<i> Survivor.</i>

713
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,552
It's kind of like what's good
and bad get flipped around,

714
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,922
and any decision is a tough one.

715
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,123
PROBST:
So, Ricard,

716
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,792
you have been the topic,
quite a few times,

717
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,761
about he's gonna win
if he gets to the end,

718
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,463
and here you are now vulnerable.

719
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,498
All it takes is three
of these people to vote for you

720
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,833
and it's over.

721
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,635
Well...

722
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,904
I think I've played
a really good game.

723
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,238
It's hard, you know?

724
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,407
We get back to camp last night,
they are rattled.

725
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,611
She's almost in tears
from what he said at Tribal.

726
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:14,979
It's really hard.

727
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,182
And I just feel like...

728
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,885
To do so well in the game,
it's just...

729
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,155
I've been struggling
and nobody even knows it,

730
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,257
and it's just...
it's-it's really hard.

731
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,227
PROBST:
You've been struggling
with things in the game

732
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,362
that people don't know about?

733
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:38,436
Last year, my husband and I,
we had got pregnant again,

734
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,371
and I didn't know...

735
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,208
if it was gonna be okay and
everything was gonna be fine,

736
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,043
and<i> Survivor</i>
kept getting pushed back,

737
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,945
and COVID and everything.

738
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,479
And then I finally get the call.

739
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,883
And I don't know what to do,

740
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,551
'cause it's, like,
my dream to be here.

741
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,355
But my baby is due next week.

742
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,790
Like, I didn't want
to tell anyone,

743
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,225
'cause what would they
think of me?

744
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,626
Like, "Oh, you're leaving."

745
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,361
Like, my baby, literally,
could already be born right now,

746
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,196
and I don't know.

747
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,433
I've been really struggling.

748
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,568
And...

749
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,305
I'm still so proud of myself
that I made it this far.

750
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,841
And I did a really
damn good job.

751
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,145
Deshawn, is this hard for you?

752
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,981
Because you are similar
to Ricard

753
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,118
in that you're very honest
and open with your emotions.

754
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,153
And you will say
when you're hurting

755
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,521
or when you're frustrated.

756
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,123
And Ricard is having
that moment right now.

757
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,358
He's being very open.

758
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,892
"I don't like this.
It hurts my heart."

759
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,995
Yeah, I mean,
I definitely understand Ricard.

760
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,063
I think Ricard and I

761
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,799
have had a very tumultuous
"frenemy-ship,"

762
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,101
I guess you'd call it,
out here.

763
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,104
And he sees my heart,
I think, when we talk.

764
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,939
And I see his.
I know he's a good dude.

765
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,407
I can hear the hurt
in his voice,

766
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,075
and I feel bad,
but at the end of the day,

767
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,311
that's my friend,
and I wish him the best of luck.

768
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,846
PROBST:
Xander, if a group of people

769
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,581
have enough numbers,
and they want to get rid of you,

770
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,150
you can't stop 'em, unless you
have an idol or the necklace.

771
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,252
How do you reconcile
that in terms of,

772
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,654
"But that's the way it goes.

773
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,955
"We have the numbers.

774
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,257
You are going home,
and you can't stop it"?

775
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,961
Yeah, I mean, Ricard's fought
so hard this entire game,

776
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:14,332
and he's just been pegged
as this guy who's in charge,

777
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,501
and, you know,
choosing who's going home,

778
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,470
but Ricard and I talk
because we've grown so close

779
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,772
-over these days.
-Bromance.

780
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,241
It, yeah...
Th-There's a bit of a bromance.

781
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,643
It's kind of great.
I love it. (laughs)

782
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,580
And, yeah, it just...
it was really hard to know

783
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,482
that people have just
put him in this position

784
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,085
where he's got his back
against the wall,

785
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,554
and there's
nothing that he can do.

786
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,456
And I feel for him.

787
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,259
Can I just say one little
thing which is funny to me?

788
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,561
Everyone's saying,
"Ricard runs the show."

789
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,229
If I was running the show,

790
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,532
Deshawn would be gone,
and I would be in final four.

791
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,133
I think Deshawn's gonna get
more votes

792
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,802
than any of the three of them.

793
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,672
Now, Erika, it's Ricard
who's got the guns out,

794
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,275
saying, "I got nothing to lose."
The truth bombs.

795
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,144
Like, I-I don't blame him
for having the guns out,

796
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,513
but because perception
is so important

797
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,216
and because of the perception
that people have

798
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,018
when it comes to Ricard,

799
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:11,022
unfortunately, like, that's a-a
big consideration of the game.

800
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,460
PROBST:
So, Ricard, why don't you
write the last paragraph?

801
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,261
What has this experience been?

802
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,964
Because it sounds like you came
out here with a lot of emotion

803
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,768
that you had to keep bottled up,
and that you've learned things

804
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,504
about yourself and you're gonna
go home to be a different person

805
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,539
than when you came out here.

806
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,209
Yeah, um...

807
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,446
I just didn't think
I would do so well.

808
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,316
I did not think
that I was capable.

809
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,152
And I'm actually, like,
really, kick-ass at<i> Survivor.</i>

810
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,720
-(chuckles) Like...
I'm good at it.
-Yes. Yeah.

811
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,255
PROBST:
And, Ricard,

812
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,425
I can see the pride
you have in yourself.

813
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,594
And that's worthy,
and it's cool to witness,

814
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,998
because even you are finding
moments of vulnerability

815
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,701
where you want to share
a little more about who you are.

816
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,203
That's because of what
you've put yourself through.

817
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,339
That's because you did
decide to come out here.

818
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:05,810
Something in you said, "I need
this. I'm gonna be a dad.

819
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,246
"I'm gonna be a better
husband, as a result of this,

820
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,247
'cause I need it."

821
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,348
And here you are.

822
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,419
If you don't win,
it can still be a victory.

823
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,221
It may not be about
the million dollars.

824
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,023
It may be about this moment
right here

825
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,058
where you're feeling
okay enough...

826
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,628
...pat yourself on the back
a little bit.

827
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,932
RICARD:
It is weird, but today,
genuinely, I had a moment

828
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:32,136
of I, literally, can be
one of the<i> Survivor</i> greats,

829
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,805
one of the greatest players
in this game,

830
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:34,939
without being a winner.

831
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:39,243
And I actually do
fully believe I am.

832
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,547
Oh, some of our best players
will never win the game.

833
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,315
It's just the way it goes.

834
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,051

1002
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,898
In addition, you have power.
You will decide

1003
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,369
which person sits next to you
in that second spot

1004
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:01,972
and who you force to make fire
for that third and final spot.

1005
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:05,909
Big power, big decisions.
First, you got to win.

1006
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,145
We'll draw for spots
and get it going.

1007
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,481
-Here we go.
-ERIKA: Okay.

♪ ♪

1009
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,290
Here we go.
Final immunity challenge

1010
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,660
of the season, guarantees
you a spot in the final three,

1011
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,830
the place you want to be.

1012
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,966
Survivors ready.

1013
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,169
Go.

1014
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,805
Out of the gate,
you can move quickly

1015
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,373
putting that first block.

1016
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,308
You're gonna be spelling
"Final 3"

1017
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,645
from the bottom to the top, but
the longer this challenge goes,

1018
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,948
the pace will slow down
dramatically.

1019
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:49,386
And right away, Deshawn gets
an idea of how this works.

1020
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,723
Xander drops, too.

1021
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,725
That's part of it.
You're trying to figure out

1022
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,727
that balance of tension
on the rope

1023
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:00,931
versus how fast your feet
are moving 'cause you want both.

1024
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,067
You want to move quickly,
but you want to move

1025
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:07,671
with some certainty that
you are keeping a balance point.

1026
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,406
With every block you add,

1027
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,575
obviously,
it gets much more difficult

1028
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,544
'cause that stack starts
to grow,

1029
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,046
and that balance becomes
really important.

1030
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,216
You drop one, you drop them all.

1031
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,552
So you could make a lot
of progress

1032
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,988
and have one little slipup,

1033
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,623
and you're back
to the beginning.

1034
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:32,096
So a big decision in this
challenge is what do you favor?

1035
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:36,333
Pace, where you're moving
a little faster, little riskier,

1036
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,037
or do you slow it down
and hope somebody else drops,

1037
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,939
and you try to get through

1038
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,075
this entire challenge
without ever dropping?

1039
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,644
Heather loses everything.
She's got to start over.

1040
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:51,014
That means you got
to take all the blocks back,

1041
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,150
grab the first one,
head back out.

1042
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:57,788
Here comes Deshawn with his
third block. Deshawn is in it.

1043
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,324
Here comes Xander heading back
with his fourth letter--

1044
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,959
the end.

1045
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:05,262
Erika ready to reach
for that fourth block.

1046
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,532
She's got to keep an eye
on what she's built so far.

1047
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:13,704
You got to be close enough
to reach it without tipping it.

1048
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,143
Xander places the "N."
He has four.

1049
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,445
Xander is now in the lead.

1050
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,614
Here comes Erika
with her fourth letter.

1051
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,818
It is possible to do this entire
challenge and never drop,

1052
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:30,120
but it requires precision.

1053
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,757
You cannot make a mistake.

1054
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,494
Deshawn drops.

1055
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,296
He's got to start again.
There comes Xander

1056
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,832
with his fifth block.
Erika's still heading

1057
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,434
back for her fifth block,

1058
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,670
so Xander is increasing
his lead right now.

1059
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,474
Xander now heading back
for his sixth and final block.

1060
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,210
This is where
it gets very dangerous.

♪ ♪

1062
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,518
He's got a lot of time.

1063
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:05,022
He doesn't have to panic,
knowing he has a one-block lead.

1064
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:09,226
And Erika drops, and that
opens the door for Xander

1065
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:13,630
to control the entire pace
of this challenge right now.

1066
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:17,801
A huge mistake by Erika.
She has to start over.

1067
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,571
And now Heather drops.
She's got to start again.

1068
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,573
The only person close right now
is Deshawn,

1069
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,274
with only two letters.

1070
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,643
This is Xander's challenge
to win,

1071
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,047
but he's got to win it.

1072
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,522
Xander now heading back out
with his sixth and final block.

1073
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,758
You can see Heather's pace
moving faster now.

1074
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,460
Erika trying to get back in it.

1075
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,295
Everybody is hoping
that Xander drops

1076
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,998
'cause that is their only shot.

1077
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:55,906
Xander places the last letter.
He has spelled "Final 3."

1078
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,676
Now he just has
to get back to the finish.

1079
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,412
Erika moving quickly now.
Places her third block.

1080
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:05,315
Deshawn coming back
with his fourth block.

1081
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,384
Anything can happen
in this challenge.

1082
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,886
You got to keep fighting
as if you got a shot.

1083
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:16,326
Xander very slow, very steady.

1084
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:21,098
It doesn't take much
with six blocks to lose it all.

1085
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,605
This could be
a million-dollar challenge.

1086
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,875
-(gasps) Oh, my God.
-Heather drops.
Got to start over.

1087
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:35,512
It's Erika with four,
Deshawn with four,

1088
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,715
Xander with all six, and he is

1089
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:43,687
about two feet away from earning
a spot in the final three.

1090
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,890
Got to have both feet
behind that tape.

1091
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:51,128
Can he get
those last few steps?

1092
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,096
Heather places
her second block.

1093
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,831
Erika heading back
for her fifth.

1094
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:57,200
Deshawn heading back
for his fifth.

1095
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,436
Xander close to that pain.

1096
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,339
He's got one foot
halfway over the line.

1097
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,075
Very close.
The first foot is over.

1098
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,744
Just got to get
that second foot over.

1099
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,283
Half an inch back.

1100
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:26,763
Xander does it!
Xander earns immunity!

1101
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,566
He's got a guaranteed spot
in the final three.

1102
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,803
After 25 days in Fiji,

1103
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,871
Xander will have a shot
at pleading his case

1104
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,540
-to the jury...
-Good job.

1105
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,975
about why he deserves
the title

1106
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,044
of Sole Survivor
and the million dollars

1107
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,447
that goes along with it.

1108
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,482
And he has power tonight
at Tribal.

1109
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,585
Great performance. Wow.

1110
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,693
Xander, come on over.

1111
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,261
(sniffles)

1112
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,932
What's the emotion right now?

1113
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,535
It feels like I've been holding
my breath this entire game,

1114
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,972
and I just got to take that
first breath of air, you know?

1115
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,910
It's-it's like breathing.
Just, I...

1116
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,980
Oh, man. I don't even know,
like... This is just

1117
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,548
such an unreal moment.

1118
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,984
You're putting the necklace
around me at final four,

1119
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,053
and-and that's just, like,

1120
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,621
the craziest sentence
I've ever said.

1121
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,591
Like, way crazier
than the butterfly thing.

1122
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,526
-(laughter)
-PROBST: Well, all right.

1123
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:30,961
Now that the challenges
are done,

1124
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,797
let's have this moment
because you're 20.

1125
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,099
You were just a teenager
yesterday.

1126
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,669
And not long before that,
you were the kid at home going,

1127
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:43,073
"One day, when I'm old enough,
I'm going to be on<i> Survivor."</i>

1128
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,642
And here you are, and now you
have a shot to win this game.

1129
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,578
Can you still see that
little kid?

1130
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,447
I mean, yeah,
I can see that little kid,

1131
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,282
and he wasn't even the kid
who was like,

1132
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,151
"I'm gonna be
on<i> Survivor</i> one day."

1133
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:58,288
He was the kid who was like,
"I could never be on<i> Survivor."</i>

1134
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,491
And I wish I could go back
in time and give him a big hug

1135
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,760
and tell him,
things are going to be fine.

1136
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,463
You know, if you work hard,
you can get it.

1137
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,732
You got it.
You are guaranteed a spot.

1138
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,635
-Yeah, bro, give me a hug.
-Yeah.
-DESHAWN: Yeah!

1139
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:14,438
-Uh, I love it.
-Yeah.

1140
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:18,108
Congratulations. I can feel
how big this is for you.

1141
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,643
And it's fun to be a part of it.

1142
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,813
You've accomplished the goal
almost all the way.

1143
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,248
One thing left to do-- win.

1144
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,083
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

1145
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,685
See you tonight
at Tribal Council

1146
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,021

somebody will be making fire.

<i>and I'm nervous</i>

1154

00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:42,058
<i>I've always loved anything about</i>
<i>pushing myself in competition</i>

1167
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,729
<i>because when I was growing up,</i>
<i>I was insecure.</i>

1168
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,566
<i>I was chubby.</i>
<i>I was not proud of who I was,</i>

1169
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,769
but I wanted to change.
I wanted to be the version

1170
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,771
of myself that I dreamed of.

1171
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,841
<i>So in ninth grade, I decided</i>

1172
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,310
<i>that I would go out</i>
<i>for the cross country team.</i>

1173
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,480
<i>At first, everybody saw me</i>
<i>as the chubby kid</i>

1174
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,749
<i>who wanted to lose weight</i>
<i>on the team.</i>

1175
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,751
<i>But after three races,</i>
<i>I had dropped two minutes</i>

1176
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,753
<i>and knocked someone off</i>
<i>the top 50 board.</i>

1177
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,389
<i>I went all the way</i>
<i>to the Nationals,</i>

1178
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,392
<i>and we became the best team</i>
<i>in Florida history.</i>

1179
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,528
<i>And I learned that through</i>
<i>hard work and discipline,</i>

1180
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,463
<i>there's nothing you can't do.</i>

1181
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,500
So to have this necklace
around me means

1182
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,969
that I got there,
that I'm that man

1183
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,204
<i>that I dreamed I could be.</i>

1184
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,874
We made the whole season in,
like, the hardest season

1185
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,343
-of all time.
-ERIKA: I know.
-DESHAWN: Crazy.

1186
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,947
Well, I don't want to be
the first one, but Xander,

1187
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,182
I just wanted to talk
and see where your head's at

1188
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,651
-so I can prepare my mind
for whatever is coming.
-No.

1189
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,852
Yeah, it makes sense.
Let's do some individual talks.

1190
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,921
HEATHER:
And I'll go next.

1191
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,457
Tonight, Xander is 1,000%
in the final three.

1192
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,159
<i>And so now, the major topic is,</i>

1193
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,994
<i>who are you gonna bring in,</i>
<i>and who's doing fire?</i>

1194
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,663
<i>I've tried to make fire</i>
<i>early on, and I struggled a lot,</i>

1195
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,232
<i>and so I'm hoping</i>
<i>and praying I don't have to</i>

1196
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,634
make this freaking fire.

1197
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,202
I want to hear your pitch.

1198
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,604
Like, you know,
why should I keep you around?

1199
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,606
-Oh, thanks, dude. Um, okay.
-Yeah.

1200
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,375
So, I would say that you stand
a really good chance of winning,

1201
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:08,244
but I think that you kind of
would decrease your chances

1202
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,913
just a bit
if you brought Erika to the end.

1203
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,383
She would be
a tough person to beat.

1204
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,518
This decision is
about perception.

1205
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,621
I have the power
to show the jury

1206
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:20,690
<i>how I'm playing my game</i>
<i>and show them that</i>

1207
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,258
all my decisions
were calculated.

1208
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,728
I'm a smart person,
and they need to know that.

1209
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,663
I'm willing to make fire,

1210
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,999
and if I can't,
I go home, and I go home happy.

1211
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,437
I don't think so.

1212
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,374
<i>At the same time, intuition is</i>
<i>something that's powerful</i>

1213
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,643
and often overlooked, so,

1214
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,278
<i>whatever my heart rests on and</i>

1215
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:44,914
my head agrees with is something
that I want to go with.

1216
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:49,486
If you think that it's better
to throw me in, I'll go in.

1217
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,254
If you think
you want to take me,

1218
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,524
I think there's, like, merit
to you taking me.

1219
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,192
Okay. I think you can go back up

1220
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,194
'cause I think
I've made my mind.

1221
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,096
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, I'm taking you.

1222
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:02,432
-You're take...?
Are you kidding? What?
-Yeah, yeah.

1223
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,770
-Oh, my God. Really?
-Yeah, yeah, you're good.

1224
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,705
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>That was not</i>
<i>what I was expecting at all.</i>

1225
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,407
I thought I was 100% going

1226
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,475
into fire with Deshawn,
so I was shocked.

1227
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,078
<i>But inside, I'm like, "Wait.</i>
<i>Do I suck? Am I beatable?</i>

1228
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,080
<i>Like, why does he want</i>
<i>to take me?"</i>

1229
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,049
<i>But if this means that</i>

1230
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,417
I get to the end
and at least plead my case,

1231
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,751
then I'll take it.

1232
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,887
You might want to practice
just in case.

1233
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,422
-Like...
-Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

1234
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,825
-No, I'll respect
the-the process and practice.
-Yeah.

1235
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,827
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>I think Erika has built</i>
<i>a good resume,</i>

1236
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,463
<i>so, why would I give her</i>
<i>the opportunity to have</i>

1237
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,965
<i>a flashy, fire-making move</i>
<i>at the end?</i>

1238
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:39,402
She's the only person here who
I know for sure can make fire

1239
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,738
because she did it
so many times in Exile.

1240
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:45,041
So I was saying
that I think you and Heather

1241
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,643
are gonna face off.

1242
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,611
-Okay. For sure.
-Yeah.

1243
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,981
Yeah, but I-I told Erika
to also practice

1244
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,650
just 'cause it's a huge decision

1245
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,385
-and you know?
-DESHAWN: Okay.

1246
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,554
<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>Being in the fire-making</i>
<i>challenge</i>

1247
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,656
<i>was the last thing</i>
<i>I wanted to do.</i>

1248
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,524
But all season long,
we've got ingrained in our head,

1249
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,759
you're gonna have
to work for everything.

1250
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,462
<i>And so,</i>
<i>me having to earn this spot</i>

1251
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,430
<i>at the final Tribal Council</i>
<i>is, like,</i>

1252
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,632
<i>picture-perfect for this season.</i>

1253
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,335
So, give me a knife, give me
a flint and let me go to work.

1254
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,739
<i>Like, let me figure out</i>
<i>how the hell I'm gonna</i>

1255
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,540
pull this out, and I'm not
gonna stop until I do.

1256
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:20,410
<i>Because you never know</i>

1257
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,845
<i>what Heather can pull out</i>
<i>of her pocket.</i>

1258
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,346
<i>She may go out there</i>

1259
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,948
<i>with a freaking piece of flint</i>
<i>and-and knife</i>

1260
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,817
and strike it one time,
and-and poof.

1261
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:34,524
<i>HEATHER:</i>
<i>I came into this game</i>

1262
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,260
as an absolute underdog,
the underdog of all underdogs.

1263
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,296
<i>But I worked hard to get here,</i>

1264
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,932
<i>and my social game</i>
<i>has been really good.</i>

1265
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,934
Here we go.

1266
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,102
<i>And now I'm going</i>

1267
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,438
to earn my spot in the top three

1268
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:51,141
<i>by winning</i>
<i>this fire-making challenge.</i>

1269
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:52,876
It's happening. There you go.

1270
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,978
XANDER:
You got it.
That was, like, six seconds.

1271
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,713
Wow.

1272
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,615
<i>I'd love to see Heather</i>
<i>in the end because</i>

1273
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,650
she's gonna talk
about the exact same things

1274
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,185
that Erika is gonna bring up,

1275
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,921
<i>because they worked together</i>
<i>this entire game.</i>

1276
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:09,959
<i>So, to have her come out on top</i>
<i>would take out Deshawn.</i>

1277
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,427
<i>It'll make Erika just look weak.</i>

1278
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:12,762
Yeah!

1279
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,631
<i>And if that happens,</i>

1280
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,099
I don't see how I couldn't win.

1281
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:23,373
Oh.

1282
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:25,108
<i>I'm definitely frustrated.</i>

1283
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,944
I can get sparks with the flint
in-in the knife consistently.

1284
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,880
<i>Like, my spark game is crazy.</i>

1285
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,882
<i>But there's no height</i>
<i>on my fire,</i>

1286
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,418
<i>and it's really frustrating me</i>
<i>because it's like</i>

1287
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,921
me doing a six-inch fire is
not gonna get the job done.

1288
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,789
All these sticks,
and nothing can...

1289
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,692
Are you joking?
Is this a joke?

1290
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,995
<i>For me, this fire-making</i>
<i>challenge means the world.</i>

1291
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,831
I see the million dollars.

1292
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,332
I can, like, almost reach out
and touch it,

1293
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,767
but if I can't start a fire,

1294
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,836
I'll never have the opportunity
to grab

1295
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:55,138
<i>what's rightfully mine,</i>
<i>so, it sucks.</i>

1296
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,223
It took me a long time on Exile.

1297
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,924
A long time.

1298
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,164
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>Oh, man. I thought since</i>

1299
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,666
she spent so much time on Exile
that she knew how to make fire.

1300
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,034
What the hell?!

1301
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:27,370
<i>She can't make fire?</i>

1302
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:30,073
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>It's like, "What?"</i>

Aw, man. I...

1304
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,144
Oh!

1305
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,648
<i>She's just advertising the fact</i>

1306
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:42,452
<i>that I could take her out</i>
<i>and make a big move.</i>

1307
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:46,923
Thank you.

1308
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:50,260
<i>Is this a ploy? Is she just</i>
<i>doing this to, like, tempt me?</i>

1309
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,661
<i>I thought</i>

1310
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:55,331
everything was figured out,
but I cannot believe

1311
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,467
she just showed me
that she can't make fire.

1312
00:58:57,533 --> 00:59:00,870
<i>Always said, until she came up</i>

1313
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,339
<i>and started practicing,</i>
<i>and she can't do it.</i>

1314
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,475
So, I can easily step down

1315
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,611
and just do the fire
and get her out.

1316
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,147

1329

So, Xander, are you aware,
as you're walking up,

1330
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,821
that the jury is going
to be craning their necks

1331
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,357
to see who has the individual
immunity necklace?

1332
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:28,658
XANDER:
Yeah, of course.

1333
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,593
I mean, from a strategic
point of view,

1334
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,297
this means that I get to make
a make-or-break decision

1335
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,834
that determines a lot
in this game.

1336
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,303
So Deshawn,
what did you see go down?

1337
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,671
'Cause now, everybody's got
to want to talk to him

1338
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:44,540

What did you want

1339
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,142
to have happen?

1340
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,044
My ideal final three
would have been to sit next

at the end.

1342
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,280
So, my recommendation

1343
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,283
to Xander was,
"Hey, throw Erika into fire,

1344
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,818
and let the best man
or woman win."

1345
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:59,122
Um, unfortunately, I didn't
win the necklace, so I have to

1346
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:01,090
rock with whatever
he has planned tonight.

1347
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,592
-How about you, Heather?
-Our conversation

1348
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:04,660

01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,629
"Throw me into fire-making
because I'm up

1350
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,031
"for the challenge.
So no hard feelings.

1351
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,099
Whatever you got to do,
I'm ready."

1352

Xander, were you surprised
by any

1353
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,505
of the three in terms of their
approach or their attitude?

1354
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,740
Not really. I mean, they've got
their own biases in it,

1355
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:21,077
and I wasn't paying
too much attention because

1356
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,980
I've already been trying
to make my decision

1357
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,982
before it even happened.

1358
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:29,252
And a lot of that actually
stems from Deshawn over here.

1359
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:32,588
His truth bomb
really told me a lot.

1360
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:36,592
When he criticized Erika's game,
the jury seemed

1361
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,862
to applaud and agree with him,
so,

1362
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:41,230
that's something
that I took to note.

1363
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,466
PROBST:
And so, Xander, you're saying,

1364
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,101
"I'm looking and trying
to get perceptions

1365
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,569
"of what I'm hearing,

1366
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,604
and what I've been hearing
over the days,"

1367
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,239
which is a very smart move
because

1368
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:52,675
this is a game
of perceptions.

1369
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,445
And the jury,
tomorrow night, is going

1370
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,513
to take their perceptions
and put 'em

1371
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,315
smack dab on top of you
with million-dollar votes.

1372
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,785
That's why that position
you're in is powerful,

1373
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:05,988
-but also risky.
-Exactly. So it seems

1374
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,192
that the jury doesn't
respect Erika's game,

1375
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:11,227
and they don't respect
Heather's game.

1376
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,163
And I get it. They've played
very similar games.

1377
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,600
But I feel like
Heather is someone

1378
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:21,504
that they've...
pinned as this goat.

how she's played.

1381
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,411
But I don't think Heather's
a goat. I disagree completely.

1382
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:32,048
I think that she's someone
who defies what people

1383
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,651
pin her to the stereotype
of being the old, frail lady,

1384

when she's actually so strong,

1385
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,455
and she's got
this youthful vigor to her.

1386
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:42,592
And I think that she might
prove people wrong,

1387
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,127

01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,464
Erika wins individual immunity.

1653
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,299
<i>I won two challenges.</i>

1654
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:05,467
I flipped the game

1655
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,669
<i>when I broke the hourglass.</i>

1656
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:09,104
I'm playing for me.

1657
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,308
<i>And, behind the scenes,</i>

1658
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,110
<i>I created the alliance</i>

1659
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,745
<i>that dominated the endgame,</i>

1660
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,747
<i>and I was always making sure</i>

1661
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,349
<i>that the biggest threat to me</i>
<i>went home.</i>

1662
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:24,519
So, now is the time for
the little Filipino immigrant,

1663
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:25,854
the Canadian citizen

1664
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,390
<i>to take off that lamb costume</i>

1665
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,192
<i>and fight for the work</i>
<i>that I've done.</i>

1666
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,495
No matter what
gets thrown at me tonight,

1667
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:35,497
I have everything it takes
to win.

1668
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,367
<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>I feel like I've grown</i>
<i>by being here,</i>

1669
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,369
so even though
tonight's not my night,

1670
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:41,937
like, I feel good about

1671
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,805
what I've been able to do.

1672
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,107
So I'm happy.

1673
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,576
<i>I can't believe I've survived</i>

1674
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,578
<i>one of the craziest seasons</i>
<i>of</i> Survivor.

1675
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,614
But I didn't only survive,
like, I thrived.

1676
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,216
This is<i> Survivor,</i>
but I feel like a thriver.

1677
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:55,984
-Yeah, no, I got you. I got you.
-You're-you're all good? Okay.

1678
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,253
-Way to go, brother,
like, come on.
-Right. Right, right, look.

1679
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,688
<i>My social skills got me here.</i>

1680
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:02,257
<i>This journey taught me</i>
<i>so much about myself,</i>

1681
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,625
<i>and resilience, and confidence</i>

1682
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:04,860

1683
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:05,861
<i>I didn't win immunity.</i>

1684
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:07,930
<i>I didn't find advantages,</i>

1685
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,731
<i>but I actually worked</i>
<i>my ass off to be here.</i>

1686
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:12,034
-Oh, my God.
-PROBST: Deshawn got flame.

1687
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,435
You are safe, my friend.

1688
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:14,670
Oh, my God.

1689
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,972
<i>Winning the game</i>
<i>would be epic to me.</i>

1690
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,241
<i>The money would literally</i>
<i>change my life,</i>

1691
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:20,909
<i>so I got to keep my foot</i>
<i>on the gas.</i>

1692
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:23,912
I don't really get nervous.

1693
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:25,480
I'm a little nervous. (chuckles)

1694

<i>There's no goats</i>

<i>This season has been a battle</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

1697
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:35,290
It would be shameful

Deshawn, Erika, Xander,

you did what you hope

1711
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,947
What's unique
about<i> Survivor</i> is,

1712
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,181
a group of people

1713
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,983

1714
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,119

a million-dollar vote.

1717
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,226
So they're gonna
ask you questions

1718
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,427
at times may seem tough,

1719
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,462
they may push
you around a little bit.

1720
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,197
They're trying to get you

1733

Evvie, hand up.
I love it.

1734
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,702
-If you don't mind.
-PROBST: Go for it.

1735
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:29,438
All right, so I just want
to start by saying

1736
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:31,440
huge congratulations
to all three of you.

1737
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:33,708
I think we all can attest that

1738
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,477
this is one of the toughest
seasons<i> Survivor's</i> ever had,

1739
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,846
and the three of you are sitting
here at the very, very end.

1740
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,816
So that's something that you
should be extremely proud of.

1741
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,218
And given, you know,
the beautiful diversity

1742
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:44,920
that brought this cast together,

1743
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,756
this is just a beautiful
final three that reflects that.

1744
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:51,059
However, the flip side of this
being a wonderful final three

1745
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:53,662
is that each of you
is up against two people

1746
01:18:53,728 --> 01:18:56,298
that have a very good shot
of getting some votes tonight.

1747
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:58,033
So, good luck,
keep making me proud,

1748
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,734
it's all you.

1749
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:00,769
Thanks for getting us started,
Evvie.

1750
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,704
Danny, weigh in on this.

1751
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,239
Where are you right now?

1752
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,875
Yeah, so, most of the jury
knows now that I have a history

1753
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:08,877
of-of being
a professional athlete,

1754
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:11,947
so I tend to break things down,

1755
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,483
especially complex games
and competitions,

1756
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:15,951
into phases or quarters.

1757
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,619
And<i> Survivor's</i> no different.

1758
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,354
This game can be broken down

1759
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,224
into pre-merge, post-merge,
final eight.

1760
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:25,026
When you do that, you allow
yourself to have a game plan.

1761
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,395
So I'd really like to hear you

1762
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:29,464
explain your game plan
coming into the game

1763
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,867
and how you adapted it
to get here.

1764
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,168
Let's start with Xander.

1765
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,237
So, going into this game,
I know a lot of fans

1766
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:38,773
like to say they want
to play a Tony-style game,

1767
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,942
or they want to play
a Spencer-style game.

1768
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,845
I really wanted
to play a Xander-style game.

1769
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:46,982
I wanted to do something
different and go with my gut,

1770
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:49,651
take big risks,
and that's exactly what I did.

1771
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,186
And going into quarter one,

1772
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,989
I knew that
from my background in athletics,

1773
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:56,591
in running cross-country
and track,

1774
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:58,226
I know that team dynamic
is strong.

1775
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,096
So, in Yase,
I wanted to be the workhorse

1776
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,097
for the tribe.

1777
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:03,431
I wanted to share advantages.

1778
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,433
I wanted to say
that we could work together

1779
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,601
and stay strong.

1780
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:09,471
So that was quarter one,
was team dynamic.

1781
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,674
And... (chuckles)
once I got into quarter two,

1782
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:14,042
we were down in numbers.

1783
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,377
Everybody knew I had an idol

1784
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:18,213
because I had to say
the butterfly thing,

1785
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,715
and a lot of people
knew about the extra vote.

1786
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,984
I was the lone soldier,
so I market myself.

1787
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:26,555
I say, "I'm a number.
You can use me. Please."

1788
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:28,790
And once the big alliance
started crumbling,

1789
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:31,159
the side that
I felt most comfortable with

1790
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,427
was going with Ricard.

1791
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,130
So, third quarter, final eight.

1792
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,698
This was the phase of my game

1793
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,667
that was keeping Ricard
as a shield.

1794
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:41,636
He was the only person that
everybody was so vehement

1795
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:44,072
about getting out instead of me,

1796
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:45,440
But it was a gamble,

1797
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,542
and had to turn on him
eventually,

1798
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:50,078
even though I loved him,
because I had an idol,

1799
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,147
and I knew I was safe
to get to the end.

1800
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:53,615
DANNY:
Got you. Thanks-thanks, man.

1801
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,717
NASEER:
And also, Xander,
you stepped forward

1802
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:58,853
to get rice post-merge
for the entire tribe.

1803
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,524
And also, the reward challenge,
you swapped the spot with Erika.

1804
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:06,895
-XANDER: Yeah.
-I felt that-that was
your social aspect of the game.

1805
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:08,496
In-in addition to that, uh,

1806
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:11,566
one day, I was really thinking
about my family and everything.

1807
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:13,068
Then you came and told me,

1808
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:16,037
"If you need to hug it out,
brother, I'm there for you."

1809
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:17,706
That was so kind.

1810
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:19,908
You-you have very kind heart.

1811
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,676
You are very social there.

1812
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:23,245
I'm proud of you for that.

1813
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:24,813
-(chuckles)
-Thank you, Naseer.

1814
01:21:24,879 --> 01:21:26,281
DANNY:
My buddy Deshawn,

1815
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:29,050
your game plan
to get you to this point.

1816
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:32,587
Yeah, so, um, coming into
<i>Survivor,</i> like, I'm a huge fan,

1817
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:35,924
so I know that the foundation
of<i> Survivor</i> is the social game.

1818
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:38,026
It doesn't matter
how many competitions you win,

1819
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,761
it doesn't matter
how many advantages you find.

1820
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:42,464
And so, first half,
first quarter of my game,

1821
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,865
it was about
building those relationships.

1822
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:46,034
So I talked to people
like Heather,

1823
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,802
and we became
really, really close.

1824
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:49,170
I talked to people like Erika.

1825
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,639
We became close.

1826
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:53,408
Naseer and I were like brothers,
by the end of the journey.

1827
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,577
Um, so moving on to
the second quarter of the game

1828
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:56,878
where we're talking
about post-merge,

1829
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:59,314
like, I soon found out
that I was on the block--

1830
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:00,649
which clued me in

1831
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:02,150
that I was probably
a big threat in this game.

1832
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:03,985
And so, it's amazing
that I'm sitting here,

1833
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:05,453
but it's because
of those relationships

1834
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,688
from the first half.

1835
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,057
And I feel like
I played a pivotal role

1836
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:11,359
in being the glue
of people to vote together.

1837
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,228
You know, just keeping
that camaraderie alive,

1838
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,096
always shutting down negativity,
for sure.

1839
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:16,965
And, you know,
if we're gonna talk

1840
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,500
about the last quarter
of the game,

1841
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:20,035
that's what you call
social capital.

1842
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,536
And that, in this game,
is invaluable.

1843
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,338
So for me,
I know it's gonna be tough

1844
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:25,373
-to get to the end,
and that's how I did it.
-DANNY: Thank you.

1845
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,842
May I interject something

1846
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:29,210
in regards to
keeping everybody together

1847
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,213
-and camaraderie with Luvu?
-Mm-hmm.

1848
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,317
That sounds nice.

1849
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,751
-Yeah.
-Can you explain why

1850
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:39,154
the first day of the merge...

1851
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,488
DESHAWN:
Mm-hmm.

1852
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:43,325
...your intention was
to pull all of us aside

1853
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,694
and say how she needs to go,

1854
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,362
Sydney should leave

1855
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,097
so that Danny wouldn't know
what to do with his game,

1856
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:52,033
that you didn't really have
a deep connection with Heather,

1857
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,301
you were just trying
to be nice to her?

1858
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:56,671
Um, basically, you threw
everyone under the bus.

1859
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:59,374
So how does that really tie
into what you just said?

1860
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:03,078
Um, so I really respect
your question a lot,

1861
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,512
but I don't think
that everything

1862
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,047
that you mentioned there
was true.

1863
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:09,050
Um, what I can definitely say
is that I did see Erika

1864
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:10,585
as a big threat
from the very beginning.

1865
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:11,986
That's true.

1866
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:13,922
Danny, actually, definitely
remember saying, like,

1867
01:23:13,988 --> 01:23:15,390
he hasn't had much of a game,

1868
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,192
and he wanted to play the game
a little bit more slow.

1869
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,828
But for me,
my truest intentions--

1870
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:20,995
and I can only be honest here--

1871
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,497
I never wanted
Danny out of the game.

1872
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,065
I never actually wanted
Heather out of the game.

1873
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:26,067
Did I want Erika
out of the game?

1874
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:27,068
I kind of did.

1875
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,336
So if those comments came out,

1876
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,672
I 1,000% apologize for that.

1877
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,006
And that's just the truth.

1878
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,476
And then Er-Erika,
please. Uh...

1879
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:35,643
ERIKA:
Oh, yeah.

1880
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,645
I mean, I had a lot
of expectations

1881
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:40,548
on how this season
was gonna go for me.

1882
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,050
And I thought,
I'm gonna come in,

1883
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:43,251
be a sweet lamb,

1884
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,954
join the bottom
of the majority alliance,

1885
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,389
vote with them
for the first vote

1886
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,791
and then slowly start
to work my way up.

1887
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,394
But the blessing
and the curse of Luvu

1888
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,529
is we kept winning,
so we never had to vote.

1889
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,931
And instead, we weren't voting
and eliminating people,

1890
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:59,401
but we were starting
to see relationships shift.

1891
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,603
And when it came
to Heather and I,

1892
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:04,773
we became
the unlikely dynamic duo

1893
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:05,874
that decided, you know,

1894
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,042
"Let's go kick ass
at the merge."

1895
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:09,844
And, of course,
I don't even go to the merge,

1896
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:11,346
I go live alone on Exile,

1897
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:14,315
and, socially,
I'm down and out of the game.

1898
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,418
I come back,
I flip over the game,

1899
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:20,822
and what I really noticed
was the opportunity

1900
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,657
with the people
who were either on the bottom,

1901
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,659
felt like they were on the outs.

1902
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:28,329
So I started socially to
sow my seeds with those people

1903
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,331
and build relationships
with them now,

1904
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:33,368
so that I can reap this harvest
later in the game--

1905
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:34,369
maybe unnoticed.

1906
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:35,437
I think some people noticed.

1907
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:36,738
I know Shan noticed,

1908
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,907
and that's why I really wanted
to take out Shan.

1909
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:41,843
And then I found myself
in the majority alliance

1910
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,612
that dominated the late stage
of the game.

1911
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,815
When I looked at
the final six, I knew,

1912
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,517
no matter what
combination of final five,

1913
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:52,987
I had set myself up
with enough potential allies

1914
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:56,324
to know that I had a shot
to sit in the final three.

1915
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:57,892
Yes, thank you.

1916
01:24:57,959 --> 01:25:01,563
Erika, you had
a very fantastic game.

1917
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,431
-Thank you.
-I adore you.

1918
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:05,433
I really trust you.

1919
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,001
And what's unfortunate is,

1920
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:10,171
you lacked that social game
with most of the jury,

1921
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,907
and so they don't feel
the same way I do.

1922
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,943
And I'm just like, "Oh,
I wish you could all see it."

1923
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:16,945
-I know. I know. I know.
-You know, it's unfortunate.

1924
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:19,080
But there is something to be
said about having a relationship

1925
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,349
with everybody,
like Deshawn did,

1926
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:23,718
because that also made it easier
for him to betray everybody.

1927
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,154
So did you choose

1928
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:28,857
to only have relationships
with certain individuals?

1929
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:30,158
Can you just explain that?

1930
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:32,060
This is a great discussion,
because for me,

1931
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:34,929
what kind of drives me crazy
watching<i> Survivor</i>

1932
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,165
is the perception that
having a strong social game

1933
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:40,768
is feeling like you have
strong ties with everyone.

1934
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:45,039
But I think that having a strong
command of the social game

1935
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:48,376
is knowing where you stand and
what you're capable of doing.

1936
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:51,813
So I knew I wanted
to be kind to everybody,

1937
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,916
but I know that I do better
in one-on-one connections

1938
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,484
and, like, smaller connections.

1939
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:58,553
So I'm not the type of person
who's going to be best friends

1940
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,722
with all of you, even though
I think it could happen.

1941
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,457
Down the line,
hit me up on FaceTime.

1942
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:05,994
And I think a big part
of my social game

1943
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,495
is my relationship with Heather.

1944
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:10,064
I think a lot of people saw
my relationship with Heather

1945
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:13,067
as, like, I was the brains
of the operation,

1946
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:14,769
or Heather was just,
like, an extra vote

1947
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:15,770
that I dragged around.

1948
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,305
But that was not true.

1949
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:18,806
It was actually knowing, like,

1950
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:21,409
how this duo
could work together,

1951
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,845
even when there was a public
attempt to try to split us up--

1952
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,380
otherwise known as a truth bomb.

1953
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:28,182
It's wild to me that
we were a known pair

1954
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:31,219
and we still were able
to make it into the top four--

1955
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:32,320
which is so rare.

1956
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,756
I wish I got
to know more people,

1957
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:38,226
but I knew socially, like, what
I was capable of in this game,

1958
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:39,460
and I played within that.

1959
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:40,862
RICARD:
Well, thank you,

1960
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:43,131
and I hope you're able
to prove your game to this jury.

1961
01:26:43,197 --> 01:26:45,166
TIFFANY:
I have a question for Xander.

1962
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:48,736
What was your perception
of where you stood with Yase

1963
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:50,305
going into the merge,

1964
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:53,274
and how did that speak
to your overall social game?

1965
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:55,677
Going into the merge,
I was gonna look like someone

1966
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,345
who was maybe an Ozzy-type,

1967
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:58,746
someone who'd be good
at challenges.

1968
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:01,683
And those people,
they just don't make it far.

1969
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:04,319
But we sang
in the rain together.

1970
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,254
It was, it was cute.
(chuckles)

1971
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:09,223
So I knew that, like, you know,
you guys would keep me around,

1972
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:11,125
and I-I genuinely did
want to protect you guys.

1973
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:15,129
It's just, at a certain point,
it was so detrimental to my game

1974
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:17,131
that I had to adapt.

1975
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:19,067
And, yeah, it hurt,

1976
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:20,735
but there was nothing
I could do at that point.

1977
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:22,704
-My hands were tied.
-LIANA: But, more specifically,

1978
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,405
I wanted to ask,
was there a point in the game

1979
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,608
where you had a good read,
in terms of social awareness,

1980
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:27,909
where you use that
to your advantage

1981
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:28,977
to make a move in the game?

1982
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,646
Yeah, um, I would say...

1983
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:33,247
(sucks teeth)

1984
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:38,286
I would say
my social awareness, um...

1985
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:43,625
LIANA:
Like, an example
of social awareness is:

1986
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:45,526
"I knew about your advantage
the minute that you had it,

1987
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,061
"but you assume
that I didn't know about it.

1988
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:49,197
And I use that
to my advantage in the game."

1989
01:27:49,263 --> 01:27:51,766
So I'm asking, was there
ever a moment like that for you?

1990
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,301
-And if not, that's cool, too.
-XANDER: Yeah.

1991
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:55,236
Yeah, um, so,
during the Tiffany vote,

1992
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:58,640
I was fed different stories.

1993
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:00,008
Suddenly, it was Heather.

1994
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,210
Suddenly, it was Naseer.

1995
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:04,245
And so, that's how
I was able to figure out

1996
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:05,480
I was likely getting duped

1997
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,215
and that
I would have to play my idol.

1998
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:08,850
-Thank you.
-So you were,
you were reading the room?

1999
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,284
-XANDER: Yes. Yeah, yeah.
-Thank you.

2000
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:12,186
EVVIE:
A question related to that.

2001
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:13,521
An amazing thing for your game

2002
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:14,856
was that you were able
to hold on to that idol

2003
01:28:14,922 --> 01:28:16,557
even though everyone
knew about it, post-merge.

2004
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:18,559
Was that, you know, luck?

2005
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,194
Or was that your social
game was good enough

2006
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:23,331
that you actually knew
from people

2007
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:24,432
that you didn't need
to play it each time?

2008
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:26,434
I think it was
a mixture of both.

2009
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,336
I wanted to play this game
a little paranoid,

2010
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:31,005
because paranoid people are
always thinking of every option.

2011
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,441
So when I went
into every Tribal Council,

2012
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:34,776
I was nervous as hell.

2013
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:37,445
You know, do I play it,
do I not play it?

2014
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:39,914
But my relationship with
Ricard was strong enough

2015
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,850
to the point where when
he said, "Play your idol,"

2016
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,786
he meant that
people were voting for me.

2017
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:47,121
But I knew that
with the chaos of Tribal,

2018
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:50,458
people wouldn't have the unity
to take me out.

2019
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:51,993
So a mix of both.

2020
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,361
RICARD:
Xander,

2021
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:57,165
we had a really solid
friendship, in my opinion.

2022
01:28:57,231 --> 01:28:59,701
I've never had this,
like, bromance

2023
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,669
where I was like, "Oh, my God,
this is Uncle Xander.

2024
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,571
He's gonna be meeting
my daughter. This is amazing."

2025
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:05,239
Like, we were tight.

2026
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:07,041
I can attempt

2027
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,844
to get past the idea
of voting me out

2028
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:11,746
in a strategic light,

2029
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:14,615
but what doesn't make sense
to me is

2030
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:16,984
you take out
the number one threat, me,

2031
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:18,920
but the number two threat,
Erika's here.

2032
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:22,056
And I know, at some point,
people are gonna ask you

2033
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:24,358
about the fire-making decision
because...

2034
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,627
Uh, it's all... it's crazy.

2035
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:29,130
I'm not getting into that,
necessarily.

2036
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,131
I'm just confused.

2037
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,799
Were you always lying to me?

2038
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:33,468
Was that a fake relationship?

2039
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:34,669
I just don't understand,

2040
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:36,804
because those two things
don't go together.

2041
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,273
Our relationship
was completely real.

2042
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:42,310
Like, I love people, and I love
to make these connections.

2043
01:29:42,376 --> 01:29:44,445
And our connection
was completely real,

2044
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:47,181
but you would have won
against anyone, and...

2045
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:50,218
So why did you keep her?

2046
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:51,519
I was under the impression

2047
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,755
that Erika wasn't
the biggest strategic threat

2048
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:56,324
compared to me because
that was what Deshawn said

2049
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,259
during his truth bomb,

2050
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:00,962
and I felt like the jury
reacted positively to it.

2051
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:04,365
And that could be
a fallacy in my game.

2052
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:05,900
So I-I'm willing to admit that.

2053
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:07,702
HEATHER:
I-I want to interject.

2054
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:11,205
I said to Xander
on the last day,

2055
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:12,573
"The only person
that's left here

2056
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,675
"that could possibly
take your game away from you

2057
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,277
is my friend Erika."

2058
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:19,514
And you chose
to take her with you.

2059
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:23,584
Explain why
this was benefiting your game,

2060
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:25,253
taking her beside you.

2061
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,255
I agree with you
in the sense that

2062
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:28,923
she's someone
who's very strategic,

2063
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:31,325
but I feel like
I've got an edge on her

2064
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:33,261
because I've had
a more wholesale game.

2065
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:35,863
So I didn't
give her the opportunity

2066
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,265
to beat someone in fire,

2067
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:39,100
'cause if she beats someone
in fire,

2068
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:41,636
I think that would have tipped
the balance in her favor.

2069
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:43,504
-So I didn't take that chance.
-TIFFANY: Okay.

2070
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:44,639
-Hmm.
-That's a good answer.
-That makes sense.

2071
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:45,706
Yeah.

2072
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:47,975
So, my question's for you,
Deshawn.

2073
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:49,277
DESHAWN:
Yeah.

2074
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:51,679
I felt like you listed
a few different moves,

2075
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:53,281
-which sound like
it's strategic...
-Yeah.

2076
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:56,551
-Yeah.
-...but it felt more
like temper tantrums.

2077
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:59,120
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Like, there was
a lot of emotion involved.

2078
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:00,454
And emotion
is not a bad thing, at all.

2079
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:01,923
-It's very powerful.
-Yeah. Yeah.

2080
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,324
But it felt like at every turn

2081
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,426
where you had
an emotional breakdown,

2082
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:06,994
I had to come to you and, like,

2083
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:08,863
figure out how
I could talk to you

2084
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,932
because I wanted
this four-way alliance,

2085
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:12,433
you know, to work with,
you know,

2086
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,602
myself, you,
and Liana and Danny.

2087
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:15,636
DESHAWN:
Yeah.

2088
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:16,771
SHAN:
And at every turn

2089
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:18,005
when we had these conversations,

2090
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:20,274
you relocked us in
with this social movement

2091
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:21,342
that was really important to us,

2092
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:22,276
that's happening
in the real world.

2093
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:23,811
And we were all wanting

2094
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:25,279
to bring home a win
for the Black community.

2095
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:26,547
-Right?
-Yeah.

2096
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,683
And I felt like that
hijacked me, emotionally,

2097
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:31,018
a lot of the times,
because I was really locked in.

2098
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:32,687
And that's, honestly,
where I was gonna put my game.

2099
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:34,222
I would have come in fourth

2100
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:36,023
for all three of you to take
one, two and three, you know?

2101
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:37,391
-Mm-hmm.
-And I said that to you,

2102
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,026
-time and time again.
-Mm-hmm.

2103
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,895
It's really important
for my vote tonight

2104
01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:42,763
to know what happened.

2105
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:46,601
Were you capitalizing
on a social movement back home

2106
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:48,803
and using that to hijack me

2107
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,872
and maybe the other people
in our alliance?

2108
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:53,140
Or were you serious about that?

2109
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:55,877
Uh, because that feels like,
to me, out of bounds.

2110
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:57,812
I just want to make it
very, very clear, right now.

2111
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:00,581
I don't even care
about how this...

2112
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:02,083
Give me third.

2113
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:05,419
I would never, ever
sell out my people for a game.

2114
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:07,088
That was never my intentions,
ever.

2115
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:10,258
And I just want to touch
on the point of, you know,

2116
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:12,894
were the moves that happened
at Tribal emotional?

2117
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,328
Not emotional, not emotional.

2118
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:15,830
-Temper tantrums.
-DESHAWN: Temper tantrums.

2119
01:32:15,897 --> 01:32:17,798
-Sulking and pouting. Yeah.
-Right, right, right, yeah.

2120
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,800
So I have to accept that
that's the way it was perceived.

2121
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:22,103
But I wore my heart
on my sleeve, and so, if I felt

2122
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:24,038
like people weren't listening,
that's the way I responded.

2123
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:25,606
And I'm young.

2124
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:27,708
I have to admit, I have a lot
to learn, so that's just that.

2125
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:29,610
Um, it does hurt my heart
a little bit

2126
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:31,145
that it would even be considered

2127
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,980
that I would use
a social movement in this game.

2128
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:36,150
Um, but I understand, from your
vantage point, how you feel.

2129
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,719
You and I have
a very personal relationship.

2130
01:32:38,786 --> 01:32:40,421
I think of you as my sister.

2131
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,356
And that's why I was so
emotional at Tribal Council.

2132
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:44,926
Like, I was hurting, Shan.
It really, really hurt me

2133
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:46,928
that Tribal Council
to have to vote you out,

2134
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:49,897
and all I can do
is apologize for that.

2135
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:51,732
It is something
I have to bear the weight of.

2136
01:32:51,799 --> 01:32:53,567
Like, I feel...

2137
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:55,569
I would never have done that.

2138
01:32:55,636 --> 01:32:57,905
It was hard, Shan, so I'm sorry.

2139
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:00,341
-I'm sorry.
-Well, it's all forgiven
for sure.

2140
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,410
And I... I'm super proud of you

2141
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:04,745
for sitting there tonight,
and I think

2142
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:06,280
that you're gonna make tons
of people proud, so...

2143
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:08,449
-Thank you.
-Congratulations on final three.

2144
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,551
Thank you.

2145
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:13,988
-Any other questions?
-DANNY: Yeah, so,

2146
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,590
I really just wanted to take
a chance to address Erika

2147
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:19,794
for a second.
Um, from a competitor

2148
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:23,864
and competitively-speaking, I
think you did absolutely amazing

2149
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:28,402
in the individual immunity
challenges and the puzzles, and

2150
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:30,237
intentionally
or unintentionally,

2151
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:33,040
you allow people
to underestimate you, uh,

2152
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:36,077
and not see what you were
really capable of doing.

2153
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:38,212
Danny, coming through. I mean,

2154
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:41,148
the reality is, I've spent,
like, almost ten years, like,

2155
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:43,684
going into boardrooms,
people treat me like the intern,

2156
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:45,653
but I'm really the one
who's running the meeting.

2157
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:49,357
Again, I was never out
in front, but I was never quite

2158
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:52,426
at the bottom, and at every
Tribal Council I went to,

2159
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:54,028
I was on the right side
of the vote.

2160
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:56,797
So I wasn't sure what the path
for me was going to be

2161
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,532
to the end
when the game started,

2162
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:01,202
but I knew if I got there,
I'd be a dark horse.

2163
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:03,137
DANNY:
And I'll say that because

2164
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:05,339
I envy you
because you played the game

2165
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:07,441
that I really wanted
to play and...

2166
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:09,343
-and tried to,
so congratulations to you.
-Danny.

2167
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:11,746
-Yeah. Me, too.
-Me, too.
-(laughter)

2168
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:15,649
Um, Xander, I have one question
for you.

2169
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:17,752
Do you have an idol?

2170
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:19,153
I'm totally...

2171
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,555
-(laughter)
-Yes.

2172
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,426
-DANNY:
You all played great games.
-TIFFANY: Yeah.

2173
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,028

-SHAN: Really,
you did a good job.

-RICARD: Good job, everyone.

All right, jury, nice job.

2177
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:33,768
I'm going to give you a minute
now to think about your vote,

2178
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:36,704
and when we come back,
for the last time,

01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:38,205
we will vote.

2180
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:56,323
Okay, after 26 intense days
of gameplay here in Fiji,

2181
01:34:56,390 --> 01:35:00,061
it is time for our jury

01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:08,002
who wins season 41--
Deshawn, Erika or Xander?

2269

-you let me know.
-Touché.
-You're fine.

2271
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,607
This is the... what would
normally be the reunion show.

2272
01:39:40,674 --> 01:39:44,144
Because, as much fun as it is
to be back

2273
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:47,715
in Los Angeles and the lights
and the big crowd

2274
01:39:47,781 --> 01:39:50,317
and your family
and all that hoopla,

2275
01:39:50,384 --> 01:39:53,387
what it misses is the immediacy
and the truth.

2276
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:56,290
So, let's just talk, and if you
want something else to drink,

2277
01:39:56,357 --> 01:39:58,926
we got... we got a team out here
to bring it to you.

2278

-The champagne.
-Can I have some pizza, please?

-It's been a while.
-(overlapping chatter)

2280
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:04,331
PROBST: And while
we're doing this, Erika,

2281
01:40:04,398 --> 01:40:05,699
I want to start with you.
And whatever you need,

2282
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:07,167
-you just ask, we'll get it.
-Okay.

2283
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:11,205
There was an interesting theme
that, in your career,

2284
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:14,508
that you would go into a room,
and nobody would ever guess

2285
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:16,076
that you were the one in charge.

2286
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:18,912
-Yeah.
-That becomes a skill
in a game like<i> Survivor,</i>

2287
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:20,347
where you were able,
even with your ego,

2288
01:40:20,414 --> 01:40:23,217
to say, "I don't have to have
them think I'm in charge.

2289
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:25,152
I just need a path to the end."

2290
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:27,187
How much of that going in
was something

2291
01:40:27,254 --> 01:40:28,756
you knew you could count on?

2292
01:40:28,822 --> 01:40:31,325
The way that I look, like,
really affects the way

2293
01:40:31,392 --> 01:40:33,794
that people treat me
outside of the game.

2294
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,696
Like, whenever I go
to the airport by myself,

2295
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:37,331
even though
I'm a frequent traveler,

2296
01:40:37,398 --> 01:40:39,666
people ask me
if I'm an unaccompanied minor,

2297
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:42,903
and I have to go through all the
extra steps because I'm a kid.

2298
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:45,973
So I knew that was something
that, like, I had up my sleeve.

2299
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:48,108
And the other thing is,
like, yeah,

2300
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:50,411
I had no ego
about how I was gonna play it.

2301
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:52,913
I knew that, you know, if
it made more sense for Heather

2302
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,882
to talk to someone,
she could do it.

2303
01:40:54,948 --> 01:40:58,085
I don't need to have
the full credit for anything.

2304
01:40:58,152 --> 01:41:00,521
And I knew that the path
to the end--

2305
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:01,922
it didn't have to be pretty.

2306
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:03,257
I think Tiffany
and I talked about it.

2307
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:04,625
Didn't have to be pretty,
I just had to get here.

2308
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:06,527
I didn't have to look
like the one in charge.

2309
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:09,296
I just needed to have the chance
to plead my case.

2310
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:12,232
One of the things they don't
know is that I visited you

2311
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:14,234
when you were out alone
on that island.

2312
01:41:14,301 --> 01:41:16,670
I was the one that came
and delivered the twist

2313
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:19,807
-that Danny adored so much.
-(laughter)

2314
01:41:19,873 --> 01:41:23,076
And I got to say,
when I saw you out there,

2315
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:25,279
I asked you how it was,
and you said, "You know,

2316
01:41:25,345 --> 01:41:26,647
"the first night
was kind of tough.

2317
01:41:26,713 --> 01:41:28,315
<i>"You know, I'm alone, it's wet,</i>

2318
01:41:28,382 --> 01:41:32,286
<i>"it's hard to live on an island,</i>
<i>but I kept striking the flint,</i>

2319
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:34,388
<i>and I kept saying,</i>
<i>'I'm going to get fire.'"</i>

2320
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:36,123
Oh, my God, please stay lit.

2321
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:37,925
<i>PROBST:</i>
<i>What I saw when I saw you was</i>

2322
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:41,061
<i>a different person</i>
<i>than the first half of the game.</i>

2323
01:41:41,128 --> 01:41:44,097
<i>You looked like</i>
<i>you belonged on that island.</i>

2324
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:46,800
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>Oh, 100%. Like, being on Exile,</i>

2325
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:48,869
<i>it felt like</i>
<i>the turning point in my game.</i>

2326
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:50,971
Like, two days before
I was on Exile,

2327
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:52,906
I actually had a breakdown
by myself.

2328
01:41:52,973 --> 01:41:54,608
I was on the winning Luvu tribe.

2329
01:41:54,675 --> 01:41:57,444
You would think that everything
is great, and I was, like,

2330
01:41:57,511 --> 01:42:00,113
crying, thinking, "How am I
going to win this game?

2331
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:01,949
I haven't even had
to vote for anyone."

2332
01:42:02,015 --> 01:42:04,852
Like, how am I supposed to have
the cred at the end of the game?

2333
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:07,821
And then when I had to face my
greatest fear, to go one night

2334
01:42:07,888 --> 01:42:11,525
alone on Exile, and realizing
that I could do it?

2335
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:13,927
Like, the rest of the game
was totally possible.

2336
01:42:13,994 --> 01:42:15,896
And I was looking at my fire

2337
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:17,631
that took me
nearly two hours to build...

2338
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:19,633
So maybe Xander should have
sent me into fire.

2339
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,168
I don't think
I would have the hero moment.

2340
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:22,636
Like, that's when I realized,
like,

2341
01:42:22,703 --> 01:42:25,172
<i>"Survivor's</i> going to be hard,
but as long

2342
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:27,007
"as I keep going,
then I know I have

2343
01:42:27,074 --> 01:42:28,876
what it takes
to get to the end."

2344
01:42:28,942 --> 01:42:31,044
-All right, well done.
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

2345
01:42:31,111 --> 01:42:34,448
-To our first Canadian winner!
-To Erika!
-(cheering)

2346
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:37,718
That's a lot of money
in Canada, so thank you.

2347
01:42:37,784 --> 01:42:40,454
-(overlapping chatter)
-PROBST: So, Xander,

2348
01:42:40,521 --> 01:42:43,390
I want to talk to you because
it's a very hard game to play.

2349
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:44,825
You're very young
to get this deep.

2350
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:47,694
And that was the theme
that the jury,

2351
01:42:47,761 --> 01:42:49,863
most of whom are older,
picked up on, is,

2352
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:52,099
if there was something
you were missing,

2353
01:42:52,165 --> 01:42:54,134
it was a social awareness
to figure out

2354
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:57,037
what is happening in the game
that you're not seeing.

2355
01:42:57,104 --> 01:43:00,274
So when you hear that,
what's your take on it?

2356
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,544
Yeah, I mean, honestly,
I'm very appreciative

2357
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:04,811
of this whole experience.

2358
01:43:04,878 --> 01:43:07,347
It's been, like, such a trip.

2359
01:43:07,414 --> 01:43:09,249
I did everything
that I wanted to do.

2360
01:43:09,316 --> 01:43:10,584
I accomplished so much.

2361
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:13,420
And I didn't want it to be
something that was easy.

2362
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:15,789
I didn't want it to be...
It wasn't about the win for me.

2363
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:17,858
It was about
being able to come out here

2364
01:43:17,925 --> 01:43:20,027
and struggle
and get this experience.

2365
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:22,563
And, yeah, I did so many things.

2366
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:24,565
I made you laugh.
I won a challenge.

2367
01:43:24,631 --> 01:43:26,633
I found an idol.
I risked my vote.

2368
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,970
I had an extra vote.
I made it to the final three.

2369
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:32,506
And yeah, I mean, I'm so proud.

2370
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:35,175
I knew going in
that no matter what happened,

2371
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:36,677
I would be so proud of myself.

2372
01:43:36,743 --> 01:43:40,013
And not getting any votes--
as much as I knew

2373
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:43,850
Erika was a threat, and I was
trying to underplay that,

2374
01:43:43,917 --> 01:43:48,522
I didn't see exactly how much
people respected her gameplay.

2375
01:43:48,589 --> 01:43:49,990
So, that was completely on me.

2376
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,959
And now I get
to take this information,

2377
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:53,226
and I get to grow from it,
and learn.

2378
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:55,729
And I love
that I'm not, you know,

2379
01:43:55,796 --> 01:43:59,166
a complete person, that I do
have more things to work on.

2380
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,801
PROBST:
And what's interesting
about your story is,

2381
01:44:00,867 --> 01:44:04,171
you said so clearly,
"I wasn't the kid

2382
01:44:04,237 --> 01:44:06,840
"that watched<i> Survivor</i>
and dreamed of being on.

2383
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:09,843
"I was the kid who lamented
I would never be on,

2384
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,645
because I didn't have
what it takes."

2385
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:14,881
What did you learn that you can
connect back to that little kid

2386
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:16,917
-to say, "I had it all along"?
-Yeah.

2387
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:18,418
I mean, I wish
I could go back in time

2388
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:21,555
and tell him
that the only limits that exist

2389
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:23,624
in this world are the limits
you place on yourself.

2390
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,525
Don't listen
to what anybody says,

2391
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,761
because you can do anything,
if you just want it.

2392
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:30,130
If you give it heart,
and you fight for what you want,

2393
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:34,201
-then you can achieve it.
-Well, huge congratulations
to you,

2394
01:44:34,267 --> 01:44:36,603
-to get this deep in the game.
-Absolutely. Absolutely.

2395
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:40,540
And Deshawn, the story
with you was being

2396
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:43,677
temperamental, emotional,
reaction, whatever you want

2397
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:46,813
to call it. Shan and Danny,
a lot of people brought it up.

2398
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,048
Did that surprise you?

2399
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,617
Um, I think it did surprise me.
I think

2400
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:54,655
maybe I had a skewed perception
of myself outside of this.

2401
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,124
And maybe<i> Survivor</i> just
brought out that side of me.

2402
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:58,759
But in, like...
in the real world,

2403
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:00,560
I didn't see myself as that.
But, like,

2404
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:02,562
this is all documented,
everything's been recorded.

2405
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:04,865
And you know,
when multiple people

2406
01:45:04,931 --> 01:45:07,034
are telling you something,
there must be truth to that.

2407
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,503
So I'm really excited
for an opportunity

2408
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:11,672
to, like, reflect and grow
from this experience.

2409
01:45:11,738 --> 01:45:15,676
Um, I thank you guys for being
willing to, like, educate me

2410
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:18,111
on-on the person that I am,
and it's just like,

2411
01:45:18,178 --> 01:45:20,013
"No, you still got some room
to grow, man."

2412
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:23,050
-So I'm-I'm excited to do that.
-PROBST: And I want to be clear.

2413
01:45:23,116 --> 01:45:24,584
I did not get the impression

2414
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:27,254
that they thought
you were a disaster.

2415
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:30,157
It was just one element
of your personality.

2416
01:45:30,223 --> 01:45:34,127
I found you, this entire time,
to be really likable, funny,

2417
01:45:34,194 --> 01:45:36,129
and you made it deep
into this game.

2418
01:45:36,196 --> 01:45:39,232
You got a vote!
I mean, getting any votes

2419
01:45:39,299 --> 01:45:41,234
-is an acknowledgment.
-Yeah.

2420
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:44,538
And for me,
your turning point seemed to be

2421
01:45:44,604 --> 01:45:46,006
the fire-making challenge.

2422
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:47,941
-When you were out of it...
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

2423
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:50,077
I mean, Heather was seconds away
from winning.

2424
01:45:50,143 --> 01:45:53,146
I was watching you.
You never once looked over.

2425
01:45:53,213 --> 01:45:55,315
-I don't know if you ever looked
at her flame.
-Mm-hmm.

2426
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:59,286
You just kept trying
to resuscitate a dead fire.

2427
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:01,555
-DESHAWN: Mm-hmm.
-And you did!

2428
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:03,857
-(all voicing assent)
-I know it's just
making a little fire,

2429
01:46:03,924 --> 01:46:06,727
but it seemed
to represent a lot to you.

2430
01:46:06,793 --> 01:46:08,995
Yeah, no,
that was a major moment. I mean,

2431
01:46:09,062 --> 01:46:10,497
and at a certain point
in this game,

2432
01:46:10,564 --> 01:46:12,733
after a certain vote,
like, I was on the bottom.

2433
01:46:12,799 --> 01:46:14,301
And I had
the Do or Die thing happen,

2434
01:46:14,367 --> 01:46:16,603
and so, there was gonna be

2435
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:18,138
sleek chances
of me making it to the end.

2436
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:19,940
So, the fact
that I was able to come

2437
01:46:20,006 --> 01:46:21,975
into the fire-making challenge,
where it was, like,

2438
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:23,577
my last opportunity
to do or die,

2439
01:46:23,643 --> 01:46:25,912
or, like, put up or shut up,
and you know,

2440
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:27,681
I completed the task,
was amazing.

2441
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:29,983
It's definitely something
I'm never gonna forget.

2442
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,585
It definitely reminds me
to never quit,

2443
01:46:31,651 --> 01:46:34,654
never give up on myself and to
just keep-keep pushing forward.

2444
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:36,156
So, I don't know
what the perception

2445
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:38,925
might look like, but like,
I'm still so happy to be here,

2446
01:46:38,992 --> 01:46:40,727
and I'm so thankful
that I got this opportunity.

2447
01:46:40,794 --> 01:46:42,262
It was amazing.
And I'm gonna take these lessons

2448
01:46:42,329 --> 01:46:43,797
back with me
into the real world.

2449
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:45,365
So, just thank you guys for
everything, so appreciate it.

2450
01:46:45,432 --> 01:46:46,767
-Ditto. Ditto.
-You rocked it, Deshawn.

2451
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:48,201
-Your fire-making challenge.
-(overlapping chatter)

2452
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:49,669
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

2453
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:51,938
Does anybody need pizza
or champagne?

2454
01:46:52,005 --> 01:46:53,840
-I'll take anything.
-(overlapping chatter)
-PROBST: Yes.

2455
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:55,642
Let's bring in...
let's bring in some more.

2456
01:46:55,709 --> 01:46:58,278
-Yeah.
-Let's get some refills in here.

2457
01:46:58,345 --> 01:47:00,013
Quick break.
We'll be right back.

2458
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,950
<i>PROBST:</i>

All right, we are back
with the<i> Survivor 41</i> after show.

2463
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,002
So let's talk
about some of the things

2464
01:47:22,068 --> 01:47:24,104
that made this season unique.

2465
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:26,873
If we look at the big things,
it would be 26 days,

2466
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,275
which I'm sure,
in the beginning, some of you

2467
01:47:28,341 --> 01:47:30,977
were like, "Oh, that doesn't
feel like a full season."

2468
01:47:31,044 --> 01:47:32,813
Is anybody feeling like
you did not get a full season?

2469
01:47:32,879 --> 01:47:35,715
-ALL: NO.
-Okay. Yeah.

2470
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:40,654
Because we offset the 26 days
by trying to approximate

2471
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,756
what a 39-day might feel like.

2472
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:44,491
And the first thing
we did is said, "No food."

2473
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:47,494
And then we put
these new twists in.

2474
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:49,996
So, let's start
with the Beware Advantages.

2475
01:47:50,063 --> 01:47:51,431
Because I know
you found an idol,

2476
01:47:51,498 --> 01:47:54,668
Shan found one,
and Naseer found one.

2477
01:47:54,734 --> 01:47:57,938
When you first find
this new advantage,

2478
01:47:58,004 --> 01:47:59,873
and it says, on the outside,

2479
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,641
"You better want this
if you open it,"

2480
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:04,444
was there any hesitation
from you, Xander?

2481
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:06,913
No. I mean, this is
my<i> Survivor</i> experience.

2482
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:10,383
And I get to be the first person
to unfold this cloth

2483
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:13,787
and figure out what the twist
is? I've-I've got to take that.

2484
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:15,889
-How about you, Shan?
-There was, for sure,
hesitation.

2485
01:48:15,956 --> 01:48:18,358
Like, I left that joint
right where it was.

2486
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:20,560
-Really?
-I actually had the information

2487
01:48:20,627 --> 01:48:22,729
about what it was beforehand,
because someone who thought

2488
01:48:22,796 --> 01:48:25,832
I was their number one shared
a lot of information with me.

2489
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:27,868
And then they got voted out.
And then...

2490
01:48:27,934 --> 01:48:29,502
So I knew what was in it

2491
01:48:29,569 --> 01:48:30,937
-without having to open it.
-Uh-huh.

2492
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:33,773
Um, so I definitely went back
and forth for a while.

2493
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,976
But then, like, I was like,
"I just want it."

2494
01:48:36,042 --> 01:48:39,713
<i>And then Genie found it</i>
<i>and told me that she found it.</i>

2495
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:41,314
Let's do it now! Let's do it
now! Let's do it now!

2496
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:42,682
<i>SHAN:</i>
<i>Ricard and I went</i>
<i>and looked at it,</i>

2497
01:48:42,749 --> 01:48:45,252
<i>and we convinced Genie</i>
<i>not to open it,</i>

2498
01:48:45,318 --> 01:48:46,987
<i>and then,</i>
<i>when no one was looking,</i>

2499
01:48:47,053 --> 01:48:48,555
I kind of went and opened it.

2500
01:48:48,622 --> 01:48:50,323
-Wow.
-And so, I was just hoping

2501
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:52,759
that Luvu would-would
find theirs, and they did.

2502
01:48:52,826 --> 01:48:55,428
PROBST:
Naseer, the phrases
were very funny,

2503
01:48:55,495 --> 01:48:58,765
so when you had to say it,
and you're not sure

2504
01:48:58,832 --> 01:49:00,934
that everyone knows
what's happening,

2505
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:02,669
how do you figure out
how to do that?

2506
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:04,204
NASEER:
So, first thing first.

2507
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:08,174
Like, wow, I had
to memorize the phrases.

2508
01:49:08,241 --> 01:49:10,810
-So...
-(laughter)
-Which one was your phrase?

2509
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:14,047
So, uh, "I'm as confused
as a goat on Astroturf."

2510
01:49:14,114 --> 01:49:16,416
-So I'm like...
-(laughter)

2511
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:19,719
So I had... I had my cave.

2512
01:49:19,786 --> 01:49:21,655
I would sit
under-under a breadfruit tree.

2513
01:49:21,721 --> 01:49:23,323
There was a huge rock.

2514
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:25,792
So I'd take a couple of coconuts
with me, go sit down,

2515
01:49:25,859 --> 01:49:28,828
and I'd start, you know,
repeating again and again,

2516
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:30,797
trying to remember.
So, like, it took me

2517
01:49:30,864 --> 01:49:32,999
at least, like, 50 to 60 times.

2518
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:34,601
-(laughter)
-Really?
-Yeah!

2519
01:49:34,668 --> 01:49:38,338
So, again, you know that English
is not my first language.

2520
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:41,174
And I'm proud to say I learned
English watching<i> Survivor.</i>

2521
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:42,642
-I love that.
-LIANA: Awesome. That's awesome.

2522
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:44,978
So, to learn a new phrase

2523
01:49:45,045 --> 01:49:48,515
from<i> Survivor--</i> it's even
more exciting, you know?

2524
01:49:48,581 --> 01:49:51,117
What a great phrase.
"I'm as confused as a goat

2525
01:49:51,184 --> 01:49:53,653
on Astroturf."
Let's get some refills in here.

2526
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,355
EVVIE:
This is so crazy.

2527
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,457
-All right, we're getting
a little more refreshments.
-Here we go, sir.

2528
01:49:57,524 --> 01:49:58,858
-Tiffany, while we do this...
-TIFFANY: Yeah.

2529
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:00,460
-...question for you.
-Oh, no.

2530
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:03,229
Does everybody know
about the night sneak?

2531
01:50:03,296 --> 01:50:05,165
Xander does not.
Did you know about it?

2532
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:07,467
-Yeah, I know.
-Okay, he knows, now.
-PROBST: Okay.

2533
01:50:07,534 --> 01:50:08,635
So, when you do that,

2534
01:50:08,702 --> 01:50:10,403
what we like about
planning a night sneak...

2535
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:11,771
I'm good right now. Yeah?

2536
01:50:11,838 --> 01:50:14,307
...is the, is the
<i>Mission: Impossible</i> of it all.

2537
01:50:14,374 --> 01:50:16,476
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Which is,
you have to get out of camp.

2538
01:50:16,543 --> 01:50:17,811
-TIFFANY: Yeah.
-You're away from camp,

2539
01:50:17,877 --> 01:50:19,045
you have to get back to camp.

2540
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:20,513
Which is the scariest part?

2541
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:22,716
Is it leaving,
being gone or coming back?

2542
01:50:22,782 --> 01:50:24,718
He didn't know that I,
at that moment,

2543
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:26,286
that I had got...
had gotten that advantage.

2544
01:50:26,353 --> 01:50:29,322
-And Liana and Evvie,
they knew I had to do it.
-(chuckles)

2545
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:31,524
So, the most dangerous part
was coming back,

2546
01:50:31,591 --> 01:50:34,694
because it started to look like
it was gonna rain.

2547
01:50:34,761 --> 01:50:37,731
And that is the only time
that Xander would have woken up.

2548
01:50:37,797 --> 01:50:41,167
It was super stressful, but
it was really fun. It was fun.

2549
01:50:41,234 --> 01:50:45,405
Evvie, let's talk about one
of the big moves of the season

2550
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:48,575
was Liana had
the knowledge is power.

2551
01:50:48,641 --> 01:50:49,542
(Tiffany chuckles)

2552
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:50,543
She sure did, Jeff.

2553
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:51,644
I need...

2554
01:50:57,984 --> 01:50:59,886
<i>EVVIE:</i>
<i>Liana went on this journey,</i>

2555
01:50:59,953 --> 01:51:02,322
and we thought that she gave
an advantage to Shan,

2556
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:03,690
but it turned out that,
actually,

2557
01:51:03,757 --> 01:51:06,259
she received the
knowledge is power advantage.

2558
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:09,062
And Shan kind of accidentally
revealed to Tiffany,

2559
01:51:09,129 --> 01:51:11,498
who then told me,
that Liana had an advantage.

2560
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:13,733
So then Liana
felt compelled to tell me

2561
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,068
she does have this advantage.

2562
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:18,071
And Liana and I sat down,
and she showed me the paper

2563
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:19,372
and I actually got to read

2564
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:21,274
-exactly how
the advantage worked.
-Wow.

2565
01:51:21,341 --> 01:51:24,144
So it became clear, when my name
was on the chopping block,

2566
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:26,146
that Liana
was no longer with us,

2567
01:51:26,212 --> 01:51:27,747
and Xander
had already been telling people,

2568
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:30,283
"I'm gonna play my idol
for Evvie."

2569
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:33,353
And so, when you're trying
to formulate a plan,

2570
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:34,621
do you have to say,

2571
01:51:34,687 --> 01:51:37,557
"Hey, meet me by the tree,
I got an idea"?

2572
01:51:37,624 --> 01:51:39,459
Yeah, well, the amazing thing
about this Yase group is,

2573
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:42,695
we had been working together for
so long that, pretty quickly,

2574
01:51:42,762 --> 01:51:45,265
I, like, flashed to Tiffany,
like, "We got to move the idol."

2575
01:51:45,331 --> 01:51:46,766
And she says to Xander,
"We got to move the idol!"

2576
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:49,769
So we run into the woods,
Xander grabs his bag.

2577
01:51:49,836 --> 01:51:52,138
Really quickly, we shove
everything down Tiff's bra.

2578
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:55,208
-(laughter)
-And Xander's putting
his fake idol

2579
01:51:55,275 --> 01:51:57,243
in his crotch,
right as Liana shows up.

2580
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,445
LIANA: Guys...

2581
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:00,080
EVVIE: Yeah.

2582
01:52:00,146 --> 01:52:01,648
LIANA:
We have to protect you.

2583
01:52:01,714 --> 01:52:02,982
-Yeah, no.
-Dude, I'm hearing my name.

2584
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:04,751
-I'm really scared.
- Don't worry about it.

2585
01:52:05,885 --> 01:52:06,920
Yeah.

2586
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:10,023
-Mm-hmm. 100%.
-Okay.
-Yeah, so...

2587
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:11,491
<i>And the timing could not</i>
<i>have been more perfect,</i>

2588
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,760
<i>because she felt</i>
<i>that she walked in on him</i>

2589
01:52:13,827 --> 01:52:16,096
<i>putting the real idol</i>
<i>in his pants,</i>

2590
01:52:16,162 --> 01:52:17,497
<i>and it just worked out</i>
<i>perfect for us</i>

2591
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:19,899
<i>that she really believed</i>
<i>that we still trusted her,</i>

2592
01:52:19,966 --> 01:52:21,101
even though we really didn't,

2593
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:23,403
and really saw
the writing on the wall.

2594
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:24,838
And, uh, you know,
got to give it to Xander,

2595
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:26,106
he acted the hell out of that.

2596
01:52:26,172 --> 01:52:27,273
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

2597
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,375
Um, and, uh, to be honest,
uh, you know,

2598
01:52:29,442 --> 01:52:30,743
it was a really scary moment
for me,

2599
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:32,745
'cause at the end of the day,
I still almost went home,

2600
01:52:32,812 --> 01:52:35,415
but to know that
we had this advantage,

2601
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:37,584
we used our relationships,
our knowledge

2602
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:39,052
that we were sharing
as a group,

2603
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:40,954
to really thwart
the first time ever

2604
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:43,923
that this advantage was played,
it was an amazing moment.

2605
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:46,593
Xander, when you
watch a moment like that

2606
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:47,727
as an audience member,

2607
01:52:47,794 --> 01:52:50,130
you forget you're watching
real people.

2608
01:52:50,196 --> 01:52:53,967
It kind of starts to feel like
a drama that you're watching.

2609
01:52:54,033 --> 01:52:56,469
But where's the heartbeat,
where's the adrenaline rush?

2610
01:52:56,536 --> 01:52:58,238
Because as Evvie described it,

2611
01:52:58,304 --> 01:53:00,273
Liana is seconds away
from showing up.

2612
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:03,343
XANDER:
Yeah, I mean, it's such a rush

2613
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:05,812
that you have
to formulate this plan

2614
01:53:05,879 --> 01:53:07,614
and figure out
exactly what to do,

2615
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:09,149
based off of information

2616
01:53:09,215 --> 01:53:11,851
that I'm not even sure is true,
and I don't know who to trust,

2617
01:53:11,918 --> 01:53:14,387
but, you know, we're just
gonna go for it anyway.

2618
01:53:14,454 --> 01:53:16,589
And snap, she's here,
so we just got to do it.

2619
01:53:16,656 --> 01:53:19,692
So, I guess we've got a plan.
(laughs)

2620
01:53:19,759 --> 01:53:22,228
And, Liana,
when you're sitting at Tribal,

2621
01:53:22,295 --> 01:53:23,930
-and you're ready to make
this big move...
-(laughter)

2622
01:53:23,997 --> 01:53:26,266
...and flip the game
upside down,

2623
01:53:26,332 --> 01:53:28,601
walk me through
what you were feeling

2624
01:53:28,668 --> 01:53:31,471
and then how it felt when
you realized you'd been had.

2625
01:53:31,538 --> 01:53:33,873
Yeah, so,
it was a really big deal

2626
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:36,509
that I even got the advantage
in the first place.

2627
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:38,444
And when I got it,
I'm like, "Wow, like,

2628
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:40,113
"the knowledge
is power advantage, like,

2629
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:43,283
that sounds like my entire
experience being at Yase,"

2630
01:53:43,349 --> 01:53:45,018
because this whole time,
this guy is like,

2631
01:53:45,084 --> 01:53:47,620
I'm the only one that's not in
on, like, that he has an idol,

2632
01:53:47,687 --> 01:53:48,688
but I knew it the whole time.

2633
01:53:48,755 --> 01:53:49,923
So, like, this is great,
you know?

2634
01:53:49,989 --> 01:53:51,858
This is, like, the-the
perfect advantage for me,

2635
01:53:51,925 --> 01:53:53,059
it's the most powerful ever.

2636
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:55,395
But I'd shown Evvie
the advantage already,

2637
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:58,231
and I knew it was super risky
going in and playing it.

2638
01:53:58,298 --> 01:54:00,333
And so, I go to Shan,
I'm like, "Shan, like,

2639
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:01,834
"I really think they,
like, moved it.

2640
01:54:01,901 --> 01:54:03,269
Like, I'm not so sure."
And I literally said...

2641
01:54:03,336 --> 01:54:05,138
I say this to her.
Something was off.

2642
01:54:05,205 --> 01:54:06,639
Like, my Spidey senses
were going,

2643
01:54:06,706 --> 01:54:09,509
but, um, this is a risky game,
I want to make this big move,

2644
01:54:09,576 --> 01:54:11,211
and, like,
I'm just gonna trust myself.

2645
01:54:11,277 --> 01:54:14,080
I just have one question
for one player.

2646
01:54:14,147 --> 01:54:15,515
Um...

2647
01:54:15,582 --> 01:54:17,083
Do you have an idol, Xander?

2648
01:54:22,255 --> 01:54:25,124
<i>It blew up in my face, but also,</i>
<i>it was almost one of, like,</i>

2649
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:27,560
<i>the proudest moments,</i>
<i>in terms of the game, for me,</i>

2650
01:54:27,627 --> 01:54:29,195
in terms of
how I responded to it.

2651
01:54:29,262 --> 01:54:31,197
-PROBST: You did.
Handled it really well.
-OTHERS: Yeah. Yeah...

2652
01:54:31,264 --> 01:54:33,266
LIANA:
Yeah, that's what's so beautiful
about<i> Survivor,</i> for me,

2653
01:54:33,333 --> 01:54:36,336
and this experience is that,
you know, I-I fell on my face.

2654
01:54:36,402 --> 01:54:37,337
(bleep) Sorry.

2655
01:54:37,403 --> 01:54:38,871
(laughter)

2656
01:54:38,938 --> 01:54:42,942
I... I, like, face-planted,
for sure, but, like, honestly?

2657
01:54:43,009 --> 01:54:45,278
In my daily life, I say, like,
I'm-I'm really a pessimist

2658
01:54:45,345 --> 01:54:47,046
a lot of time and
don't really believe in myself.

2659
01:54:47,113 --> 01:54:49,782
And, like, I don't know how to
talk to these people after that,

2660
01:54:49,849 --> 01:54:51,351
'cause they saw me, like,
fall on my face.

2661
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:52,552
And, like, what am I... like...

2662
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:54,487
I'm, like, kind of worthless,
you know?

2663
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:58,057
And there were kind of these
voices in my head of saying,

2664
01:54:58,124 --> 01:55:01,227
like, "It's okay to fail."
Like, "It's okay to fail."

2665
01:55:01,294 --> 01:55:04,731
And honestly, like, that was
the proudest moment for me,

2666
01:55:04,797 --> 01:55:07,567
'cause it could have gone
so different in my mind, like,

2667
01:55:07,634 --> 01:55:09,836
I don't even know
who this person is, right now,

2668
01:55:09,902 --> 01:55:11,771
that kind of just got back up
and is, like,

2669
01:55:11,838 --> 01:55:13,640
you know,
trying to pick up the pieces.

2670
01:55:13,706 --> 01:55:16,843
And so, it was just
really special for me

2671
01:55:16,909 --> 01:55:19,212
seeing the Liana
after that moment.

2672
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:21,281
Do you think that's permanent?

2673
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:22,982
I hope so, yeah,
I want it to be.

2674
01:55:23,049 --> 01:55:24,751
And that's, like,
that's the thing, like,

2675
01:55:24,817 --> 01:55:27,920
I think, leaving this game,
I am an entirely new person.

2676
01:55:27,987 --> 01:55:29,589
I feel like
I was kind of reborn.

2677
01:55:29,656 --> 01:55:31,991
You know, if I do fail, like,
just come back to this moment,

2678
01:55:32,058 --> 01:55:34,594
where, like, you know, like,
there's this voice in your head,

2679
01:55:34,661 --> 01:55:37,664
where you're like, "I did,
but you can get back up, Liana."

2680
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:39,799
Like, and-and it doesn't matter
what anybody else thinks.

2681
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:41,968
It's-it's about the voice
that's in your head that's like,

2682
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:44,304
"It's okay. It is okay."
And there's...

2683
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:46,039
As long as you're thinking
and you can get through it,

2684
01:55:46,105 --> 01:55:47,173
like, you can get through
anything.

2685
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:49,275
And so, I was so proud,
the next morning,

2686
01:55:49,342 --> 01:55:51,477
just, like, talking to Evvie
and being like,

2687
01:55:51,544 --> 01:55:52,845
"Dude, like,
I know that was, like, horrible,

2688
01:55:52,912 --> 01:55:55,281
"but, like, that's the move

2689
01:55:55,348 --> 01:55:57,050
that I thought was best for me
at that time."

2690
01:55:57,116 --> 01:55:59,419
And just kind of, like,
owning that moment.

2691
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:03,356
And honestly, like, that was
my proudest moment in this game.

2692
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:04,424
PROBST:
And how ironic,

2693
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:06,392
that "knowledge is power"
is what got you?

2694
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:08,294
(laughter)

2695
01:56:08,361 --> 01:56:09,696
Can I get a slice of pizza,
by the way?

2696
01:56:09,762 --> 01:56:11,864
-(laughter)
-Would you like...
-PROBST: Yes.

2697
01:56:11,931 --> 01:56:13,933
Just a moment, we're gonna take
a break and we'll be right back.

2698
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,668
Let me have a slice of that.

2699
01:56:15,735 --> 01:56:18,438
<i>PROBST:</i>
<i>Up next, Evvie,</i>
<i>Ricard and Danny</i>

2700
01:56:18,504 --> 01:56:21,507
<i>share how their</i> Survivor
<i>experience changed their life.</i>

2701
01:56:28,748 --> 01:56:31,084
All right, so we're here
in the jungles of Fiji.

2702
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:34,020
We've just finished<i> Survivor 41,</i>

2703
01:56:34,087 --> 01:56:36,489
where Erika
was awarded a million dollars.

2704
01:56:36,556 --> 01:56:37,690
She hasn't got it yet.
I'm good for it.

2705
01:56:37,757 --> 01:56:39,325
(laughter)

2706
01:56:39,392 --> 01:56:41,094
PROBST:
So, I just want to kind of hit
on a couple of things.

2707
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:44,330
Naseer, how do you explain
to somebody what it's like

2708
01:56:44,397 --> 01:56:46,199
to live with a group
of these people

2709
01:56:46,265 --> 01:56:48,668
in the real jungle in Fiji?

2710
01:56:48,735 --> 01:56:53,639
Jeff, being on<i> Survivor</i>
is my dream for ten years,

2711
01:56:53,706 --> 01:56:56,976
so I think I really enjoyed it

2712
01:56:57,043 --> 01:57:00,880
and-and appreciated every single
moment of this experience.

2713
01:57:00,947 --> 01:57:02,281
It is, and I would say,

2714
01:57:02,348 --> 01:57:06,319
it's one time--
How-how can I, uh...

2715
01:57:06,386 --> 01:57:08,688
-Once in a lifetime?
-Once in a lifetime experience.

2716
01:57:08,755 --> 01:57:12,158
There were no<i> Survivor</i> players
or castaways

2717
01:57:12,225 --> 01:57:14,427
utilized the island
the way I did.

2718
01:57:14,494 --> 01:57:16,462
Wow, you're getting
a lot of agreement.

2719
01:57:16,529 --> 01:57:17,630
-EVVIE: Absolutely.
-ERIKA: Mm-hmm.
-TIFFANY: Yeah.

2720
01:57:19,065 --> 01:57:20,400
DESHAWN:
Oh, my gosh.

2721
01:57:20,466 --> 01:57:21,968
NASEER:
Okay, food, please.

2722
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:25,905
I'm like, "That's what I want."

2723
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:35,047
Yes! (whoops)

2724
01:57:35,114 --> 01:57:38,117
<i>I was so proud of myself</i>
<i>'cause of, like,</i>

2725
01:57:38,184 --> 01:57:41,721
back home, 18 years, almost
18 year lived in Sri Lanka.

2726
01:57:41,788 --> 01:57:46,159
I-I felt like I'm-I'm back
to that age again, you know?

2727
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:47,827
When I was seven years old,

2728
01:57:47,894 --> 01:57:51,230
wearing my slingshot, no shirt,
wearing a sarong, going around,

2729
01:57:51,297 --> 01:57:55,601
you know, hunting birds
and climbing coconut trees.

2730
01:57:55,668 --> 01:57:58,838
And I-I felt it, every single
moment and every single minute

2731
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:00,573
-that I... when I was...
-Did you really?

2732
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:01,741
Of course. Absolutely.

2733
01:58:01,808 --> 01:58:03,376
'Cause I achieved my dream.

2734
01:58:03,443 --> 01:58:05,978
Even though I did not win,
I'm so happy for Erika

2735
01:58:06,045 --> 01:58:07,447
and proud of her,
the way she played.

2736
01:58:07,513 --> 01:58:09,048
I'm here to inspire

2737
01:58:09,115 --> 01:58:12,652
kids that who
was growing up in "povertry."

2738
01:58:12,718 --> 01:58:14,787
-Uh, did I say the right way,
that way?
-Poverty.

2739
01:58:14,854 --> 01:58:16,522
-Poverty. Okay. Uh...
-Poverty.

2740
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:20,193
And also, kids that growing up
in small villages,

2741
01:58:20,259 --> 01:58:24,564
that they don't have
enough support or opportunities,

2742
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:26,365
I want to
bring out this message:

2743
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:28,634
Never give up on your dreams.

2744
01:58:28,701 --> 01:58:32,071
No matter what, or...
and where you live,

2745
01:58:32,138 --> 01:58:34,173
what type of culture you have,

2746
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,108
you can wear your sarong

2747
01:58:36,175 --> 01:58:37,577
and still you can
achieve your dream.

2748
01:58:37,643 --> 01:58:39,378
-Beautiful. Love that.
-NASEER: Yeah.

2749
01:58:39,445 --> 01:58:42,148
And I-I did it,
and I'm-I'm proud of it.

2750
01:58:42,215 --> 01:58:43,649
-(laughs)
-PROBST: Congratulations.

2751
01:58:43,716 --> 01:58:45,084
Thank you.

2752
01:58:45,151 --> 01:58:47,053
Evvie, how do you
describe this experience?

2753
01:58:48,187 --> 01:58:49,889
(sighs) You know,
everyone told me, you know,

2754
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:51,557
it's gonna be
a life-changing experience.

2755
01:58:51,624 --> 01:58:54,360
And I kind of came in thinking,
you know what, I...

2756
01:58:54,427 --> 01:58:56,295
I feel, of course,
that there's always, like,

2757
01:58:56,362 --> 01:58:57,497
growth in your life,

2758
01:58:57,563 --> 01:59:00,099
but that I entered this game
feeling, like,

2759
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:02,869
pretty fully grown
and feeling...

2760
01:59:02,935 --> 01:59:05,004
feeling pretty confident
in who I am.

2761
01:59:05,071 --> 01:59:06,639
And I think
that's something I put out

2762
01:59:06,706 --> 01:59:08,307
is a lot of confidence
about who I am,

2763
01:59:08,374 --> 01:59:10,476
because I have had
growth in my life, you know?

2764
01:59:10,543 --> 01:59:15,448
But, for real, I never expected
to do anything in any challenge.

2765
01:59:15,515 --> 01:59:17,016
<i>And the fact that I was able,</i>

2766
01:59:17,083 --> 01:59:18,518
<i>you know, in the course</i>
<i>of two days to,</i>

2767
01:59:18,584 --> 01:59:20,219
<i>like, feast a reward challenge</i>

2768
01:59:20,286 --> 01:59:21,954
<i>and win an immunity challenge,</i>
<i>like,</i>

2769
01:59:22,021 --> 01:59:22,955
<i>that was life-changing for me.</i>

2770
01:59:23,022 --> 01:59:24,123
<i>It really made me feel awesome.</i>

2771
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:25,458
<i>And, like, it's really...</i>

2772
01:59:25,525 --> 01:59:26,692
it is a life-changing
experience,

2773
01:59:26,759 --> 01:59:28,094
even if you are stubborn like me

2774
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,196
and think that you can't grow,
you absolutely can,

2775
01:59:30,263 --> 01:59:33,132
and this-this place
makes it happen.

2776
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:35,334
PROBST:
Uh, Ricard,
rawest moment for you?

2777
01:59:35,401 --> 01:59:36,836
Because even now, I can tell,

2778
01:59:36,903 --> 01:59:39,138
you're still working through
all of this vote-out thing.

2779
01:59:39,205 --> 01:59:40,206
Yeah.

2780
01:59:40,273 --> 01:59:43,276
I mean, I'm...
I'm-I'm struggling.

2781
01:59:43,342 --> 01:59:44,777
I-I had an image in my head

2782
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:46,279
of what my journey
was going to be.

2783
01:59:46,345 --> 01:59:48,381
I thought I was going
to be winning today.

2784
01:59:48,447 --> 01:59:50,650
Like, genuinely,
I felt it in my whole heart.

2785
01:59:50,716 --> 01:59:54,287
But somehow,
even though the endpoint

2786
01:59:54,353 --> 01:59:57,089
was very disappointing for me--
and I'm working through it--

2787
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:00,092
It was bigger,

2788
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:03,462
and more beautiful and intense,

2789
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:06,966
and I'm more proud of myself
than I thought was possible,

2790
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:09,402
even though
I didn't achieve my goal.

2791
02:00:09,468 --> 02:00:12,171
Like, I did awesome.

2792
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:13,706
Shan and I did awesome.

2793
02:00:13,773 --> 02:00:16,309
We were, like, a power couple
this whole damn time.

2794
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:17,510
And, like, it's just...

2795
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:20,146
it's amazing to me, like,
what I'm capable of.

2796
02:00:20,212 --> 02:00:22,114
DANNY:
I was about to say, I would
like to say something, too.

2797
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:24,183
-Uh... (laughs)
-PROBST: Danny.

2798
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:26,352
Just because, um, I think
I got a little-little bit

2799
02:00:26,419 --> 02:00:29,455
of something different out here
than possibly everybody else.

2800
02:00:29,522 --> 02:00:31,257
I came out here
thinking that I just,

2801
02:00:31,324 --> 02:00:32,491
I just wanted to compete,

2802
02:00:32,558 --> 02:00:34,660
try to find something
to compete at and win.

2803
02:00:34,727 --> 02:00:38,431
And, uh, I actually
came out here and found out

2804
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:42,501
that I had a 25-year old demon
that I thought I was using

2805
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:45,371
to propel me forward
in competitions and life.

2806
02:00:45,438 --> 02:00:47,607
And then, uh, all of a sudden,

2807
02:00:47,673 --> 02:00:50,042
found out that it was something
that I needed to release.

2808
02:00:50,109 --> 02:00:51,978
Have you shared
what that demon is?

2809
02:00:52,044 --> 02:00:53,079
Or maybe you don't want to.

2810
02:00:53,145 --> 02:00:54,280
-Is it personal?
-DANNY: Uh...

2811
02:00:54,347 --> 02:00:56,415
My dad passed when I was eight,

2812
02:00:56,482 --> 02:01:00,519
and we had this... I have
this history with car accidents.

2813
02:01:00,586 --> 02:01:01,954
And as an eight-year-old boy,

2814
02:01:02,021 --> 02:01:03,689
I didn't understand
how he couldn't stay alive.

2815
02:01:04,657 --> 02:01:08,394
Um, so, for my entire life,
I was upset,

2816
02:01:08,461 --> 02:01:11,764
and I was mad at everybody
who had their dad there.

2817
02:01:11,831 --> 02:01:13,899
Then I started to become
ashamed of myself

2818
02:01:13,966 --> 02:01:16,168
for thinking that way
for so long.

2819
02:01:16,235 --> 02:01:18,804
May 4th was the 25th anniversary
of him passing,

2820
02:01:18,871 --> 02:01:20,806
and we were all out here.

2821
02:01:20,873 --> 02:01:23,009
And, it was, it was hard.

2822
02:01:23,075 --> 02:01:26,946
But, um, they kept me laughing.

2823
02:01:27,013 --> 02:01:30,316
And I really had the opportunity
to sit back and think that

2824
02:01:30,383 --> 02:01:32,551
this has been holding me back,
not propelling me forward.

2825
02:01:32,618 --> 02:01:35,221
And I...
(chuckles) I let it go.

2826
02:01:35,287 --> 02:01:37,823
And, amazingly, I told Deshawn,

2827
02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:42,461
uh, I added my dad to the
"I want to make you proud" list

2828
02:01:42,528 --> 02:01:45,031
as I'm holding that-that thing.

2829
02:01:45,097 --> 02:01:47,299
And it gave me just enough
time to win that challenge.

2830
02:01:50,469 --> 02:01:51,637
PROBST:
Ricard drops.

2831
02:01:51,704 --> 02:01:53,339
-Xander drops at the same time.
-Oh, my God.

02:01:53,406 --> 02:01:57,276

2835
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:04,183

2836
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:07,653
I'm very grateful
for the experience.

2837
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:10,356
I think I got everything
I needed out of here,

2838
02:02:10,423 --> 02:02:12,458
and I think
a lot of you helped me, uh,

2839
02:02:12,525 --> 02:02:13,626
get through some of that.

2840
02:02:13,693 --> 02:02:16,529
And I'm just happy and grateful.
Um...

2841
02:02:16,595 --> 02:02:19,565
Things are gonna change for me,
uh, when I get back, so...

2842
02:02:19,632 --> 02:02:22,268
PROBST:
Wow, thank you for sharing that.

2843
02:02:22,334 --> 02:02:24,070
Take a quick break,
we'll be right back.

2844
02:02:24,136 --> 02:02:27,473
<i>Up next, your first look</i>
<i>at</i> Survivor 42.

2845
02:02:33,312 --> 02:02:35,781
So, if you're just
tuning in, randomly,

2846
02:02:35,848 --> 02:02:38,084
-this is<i> Survivor,</i>
<i>Survivor 41.</i>
-(laughter)

2847
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:42,121
We're doing our after show
in the jungles of Fiji.

2848
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:43,289
I, also, just want
to answer the question,

2849
02:02:43,355 --> 02:02:44,290
if you're wondering,

2850
02:02:44,356 --> 02:02:45,624
where do you get pizza?

2851
02:02:45,691 --> 02:02:47,159
We make it.
Stu made this.

2852
02:02:47,226 --> 02:02:48,928
-Really good, right?
-Hell yeah.
-(overlapping agreement)

2853
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:50,396
PROBST:
Have we missed anything?

2854
02:02:50,463 --> 02:02:53,899
Because this is really sort
of an impromptu conversation.

2855
02:02:53,966 --> 02:02:56,535
And the idea was to just share,

2856
02:02:56,602 --> 02:02:59,138
have a little champagne,
and, Evvie, yes?

2857
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:01,373
I was just gonna say,
I think throughout the game,

2858
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,776
there's a lot of talk about age,
and I think

2859
02:03:03,843 --> 02:03:05,511
I was super guilty of it,
you know,

2860
02:03:05,578 --> 02:03:07,012
sometimes, saying,
like, expressions like,

2861
02:03:07,079 --> 02:03:08,481
"Ah, these kids on my tribe."

2862
02:03:08,547 --> 02:03:10,783
You know,
I had the two 20-year-olds.

2863
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:12,318
But when we look at, we had two

2864
02:03:12,384 --> 02:03:14,019
of the youngest people
to ever play,

2865
02:03:14,086 --> 02:03:16,222
and then we also had two older
women who were often targeted

2866
02:03:16,288 --> 02:03:17,957
as, like, weak,
and I was just...

2867
02:03:18,023 --> 02:03:19,658
listening to you say it,
I mean, I just think

2868
02:03:19,725 --> 02:03:22,094
we proved, like,
everyone can play this game.

2869
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:25,197
And the two youngest kids were
sometimes the most mature,

2870
02:03:25,264 --> 02:03:27,767
brilliant people, saying the
most mature, brilliant thing,

2871
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:29,535
and the two older women

2872
02:03:29,602 --> 02:03:31,437
were sometimes
the toughest people out here.

2873
02:03:31,504 --> 02:03:35,107
And I was just reflecting
that, like, if I was 20,

2874
02:03:35,174 --> 02:03:36,609
I could never look
like you guys,

2875
02:03:36,675 --> 02:03:39,812
and if I was, you know,
in my, you know, later days,

2876
02:03:39,879 --> 02:03:42,248
-I would never look
like you guys.
-Later days.

2877
02:03:42,314 --> 02:03:43,649
And, uh, I'm just really proud
of everyone out here.

2878
02:03:43,716 --> 02:03:45,084
And, like, in my confessionals,

2879
02:03:45,151 --> 02:03:46,418
-never said anything
about anyone's age!
-Ah.

2880
02:03:46,485 --> 02:03:48,754
You guys are all amazing.

2881
02:03:48,821 --> 02:03:50,422
Wait. Later Days wants
to say something.

2882
02:03:50,489 --> 02:03:54,193
-Uh, later age. 52, 52.
-I'm sorry.

2883
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:56,195
-Yeah. Inside-- 28.
-Yes, 52.

2884
02:03:56,262 --> 02:03:58,230
-Absolutely.
-Outside-- 52.

2885
02:03:58,297 --> 02:04:00,199
-Thank you.
-Absolutely.

2886
02:04:00,266 --> 02:04:01,801
PROBST:
I got to say, having been here
every single day

2887
02:04:01,867 --> 02:04:04,670
of every single season,
the reason we're all

2888
02:04:04,737 --> 02:04:07,139
still out here
21 years in is because of this.

2889
02:04:07,206 --> 02:04:10,376
And what we do
at the end of a season,

2890
02:04:10,442 --> 02:04:12,845
that we never televise,
is we do this.

2891
02:04:12,912 --> 02:04:15,815
We don't sit down and talk,
but we bring in champagne,

2892
02:04:15,881 --> 02:04:18,050
and we bring in pizza,
and we bring in our crew,

2893
02:04:18,117 --> 02:04:19,752
because our crew never talks
to anybody,

2894
02:04:19,819 --> 02:04:22,388
because we don't want you
to develop relationships.

2895
02:04:22,454 --> 02:04:24,757
We want it to be about you,
and I'm looking at this group--

2896
02:04:24,824 --> 02:04:27,326
genuinely feel like
you reinvented the game.

2897
02:04:27,393 --> 02:04:28,794
And I wasn't the one
who came up with

2898
02:04:28,861 --> 02:04:30,462
"Drop the four, keep the one."
That was somebody else.

2899
02:04:30,529 --> 02:04:32,531
I took it, you adopted it,

2900
02:04:32,598 --> 02:04:35,034
you birthed it,
you dawned a new era.

2901
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:37,503
And I just want to say,
personally, thank you,

2902
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:41,841
because to Liana's point, to
Danny's point, Deshawn, Ricard,

2903
02:04:41,907 --> 02:04:45,711
all of you have shared
these really personal things.

2904
02:04:45,778 --> 02:04:49,114
And when we're watching at home,
and I watch

2905
02:04:49,181 --> 02:04:52,384
just like everyone else,
I get moved by your stories.

2906
02:04:52,451 --> 02:04:54,153
I get inspired by your stories,

2907
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:56,088
I get entertained
by your stories,

2908
02:04:56,155 --> 02:04:57,890
and sometimes I learn
by your stories.

2909
02:04:57,957 --> 02:04:59,558
So, thank you for sharing.

2910
02:04:59,625 --> 02:05:03,495
And we're now going
to send you home.

2911
02:05:03,562 --> 02:05:04,830
We're going to stay here,

2912
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:07,566

of players

2913
02:05:07,633 --> 02:05:09,802

2914

And I will give you
a little clue.

2915
02:05:12,137 --> 02:05:14,406
There are a few things from your
season that we're going to keep,

2916
02:05:14,473 --> 02:05:16,508
and we're going
to adjust a little bit,

2917
02:05:16,575 --> 02:05:19,411
kind of extend the experiment
