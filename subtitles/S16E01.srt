1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:12,679
>> JEFF: We are flying over the

2
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:13,221
beautiful islands of

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,349
Micronesia-- crystal-clear

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,977
water, magnificent coral reefs,

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,228
and one of the most stunning

6
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,604
collections of underwater sea

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,482
life in the world.

8
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,234
Just below me are ten Americans

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,110
who are about to begin the

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:31,197
adventure of a lifetime.

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,115
They share only one thing in

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,076
common-- they are all fans of

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,619
<i>Survivor.</i>

14
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,162
These fans have finally been

15
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,289
given the chance to be a

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,248
contestant in their favorite

17
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,292
game, but they're completely

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,295
unaware that they'll be playing

19
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,629
against some of their favorite

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,716
Survivors from seasons past.

21
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,300
>> You could be a fan of the

22
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,092
Boston Red Sox, man, but you

23
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,135
don't want to play against the

24
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,179
Boston Red Sox.

25
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,263
You're going to gets your ass

26
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,181
handed to you.

27
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,432
>> I played a perfect game last

28
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,183
time.

29
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,225
I consider myself the greatest

30
00:00:59,309 --> 00:00:59,809
player in the history of the

31
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,394
game.

32
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,437
>> Coming back I'm playing

33
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,646
aggressively, and pretty much no

34
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,107
holds barred for me.

35
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,692
>> The only reason to come back

36
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,027
is for the $1 million.

37
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,652
That's the only reason I will

38
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,404
put up with a lot of suffering

39
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,865
and bugs and smelly people.

40
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,116
>> People at home watching

41
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,201
identify with me.

42
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,452
I'm like the person at home

43
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,411
watching on the coach, remember?

44
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,830
I was the couch potato.

45
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,456
>> I can almost be on the fan's

46
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,332
side.

47
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,166
Because I'm a fan of all these

48
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,959
people.

49
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,085
So for me to see, like, Yau and

50
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:26,961
Ozzy over here was, like, was

51
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,213
crazy.

52
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,631
>> Everybody wants to beat me

53
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,299
now, and hopefully I can tap

54
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,218
into that same kind of energy

55
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,969
and will that I had last time.

56
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,429
>> JEFF: It is the ultimate game

57
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,431
with a new twist-- ten of

58
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,266
<i>Survivor's</i> biggest fans taking

59
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,268
on ten of their favorite

60
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,269
players.

61
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,647
For the next 39 days, they'll be

62
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,315
forced to work together,

63
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,358
creating a new society, while

64
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,360
battling the elements and each

65
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,070
other.

66
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,446
They must learn to adapt or

67
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,447
they'll be voted out of the

68
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,365
game.

69
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,533
In the end, only one will remain

70
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,784
to claim the million-dollar

71
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,326
prize.

72
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,454
39 days, 20 people, one

73
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,999
Survivor!

74
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:05,708
Captioning sponsored by

CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK

(<i> theme song playing</i> )

78
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,458
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

79
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,796
>> I have always been a huge fan

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,422
of<i> Survivor.</i>

81
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,549
When we first pulled in on the

82
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,842
boat, it was a torrential

83
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,259
downpour.

84
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,345
One of my life dreams has been

85
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,305
to come out and try and survive

86
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,974
in the wild, so this is really

87
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,309
incredible for me.

88
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,269
>> JEFF: So welcome to

89
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,646
Micronesia.

90
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,606
>> I'm a fan, so coming

91
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,359
to<i> Survivor</i> and starting up the

92
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,402
game on the beach with Jeff, you

93
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,570
know, seeing him there, it was

94
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,488
surreal.

95
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,447
>> JEFF: You guys want to know

96
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,406
who you're playing against?

97
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,367
>> Yeah!

98
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,118
>> Yeah.

99
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,620
>> JEFF: Seeing how big a fans

100
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,288
of<i> Survivor</i> you are, it is only

101
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,374
fitting that you are going to

102
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,833
compete against some of your

103
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,459
favorite Survivors from seasons

104
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,128
past.

105
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:14,337
>> Oh!

106
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,421
>> Oh, my god!

107
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,340
>> JEFF: Come on out!

108
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:22,053
Cirie from Exile Island.

109
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,597
>> This is cool for us to eat

110
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,141
this like this, right?

111
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,311
>> JEFF: Come on out!

112
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,313
Ozzy, from<i> Survivor: Cook</i>

113
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,439
<i>Islands.</i>

114
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,400
A little less hair but the same

115
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,693
Ozzy.

116
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,694
>> He's so high up there right

117
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,531
now.

118
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,701
>> I know a lot about Ozzy

119
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,828
simply in terms of competition.

120
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,287
He has owned almost all the

121
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,123
challenges, but I myself am a

122
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,416
track and cross country runner.

123
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,500
I think I have what it takes to

124
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,293
compete at that level.

125
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,087
>> JEFF: Come on out.

126
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,048
Ami from<i> Survivor: Vanautau.</i>

127
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:04,470
>> Hi, girlfriend.

128
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,432
>> JEFF: Come on out.

129
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:11,185
Jonathan Penner.

130
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,687
>> Thank you!

131
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,688
>> If you want to mutiny, step

132
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,647
off your mat and join the other

133
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,358
tribe.

134
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,402
>> JEFF: Come on out!

135
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,697
Up next, Eliza from<i> Survivor:</i>

136
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,532
<i>Vanuatu.</i>

137
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,575
>> You've been trying to plot

138
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,326
against me from day one.

139
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,910
>> For the last three freaking

140
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,453
days you have been driving

141
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,455
everybody freaking nuts.

142
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,957
Chill out!

143
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,585
>> JEFF: Come on out!

144
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,630
>> From<i> Survivor: China,</i> James.

145
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,514
>> When I saw James come around

146
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,474
the corner, I got excited,

147
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,684
because he is, up until this

148
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,561
season, the biggest and

149
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,979
strongest that has ever played

150
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,521
the game.

151
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,107
I think I can take him.

152
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,108
>> JEFF: Let's bring out the

153
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,359
next member of your tribe.

154
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,611
Come on out.

155
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:06,324
Parvati, from<i> Survivor: Cook</i>

156
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,700
<i>Islands.</i>

157
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,202
>> Thank you, Jeff.

158
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,369
I've got two naked guys in a hot

159
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,582
tub.

160
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,917
>> JEFF: Let's see who else is

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,001
on this tribe.

162
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:17,585
Come on out.

163
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:22,632
Yau-Man from<i> Survivor: Fiji.</i>

164
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,970
>> I'm about to jump out of my

165
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,764
skin here!

166
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,933
Blue turtle.

167
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,601
>> JEFF: The biggest round of

168
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,646
applause so far, Yau-Man.

169
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,439
>> These are people I've watched

170
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,774
on TV, and so there's that

171
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,275
certain awe about them,

172
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,860
especially Yau-Man.

173
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,486
I saw him come out with that

174
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,655
little Yau-Man hat and the

175
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,948
little glasses.

176
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,533
I love the Yau-Man.

177
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,617
>> JEFF: The next member of the

178
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,661
favorites team, Amanda from

179
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,996
<i>Survivor: China.</i>

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,581
>> I have a really good idea.

181
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,457
Get rid of James tonight.

182
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,293
He doesn't expect it right now.

183
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,796
>> JEFF: So we have ten fans, we

184
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,256
have nine favorites.

185
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,675
We are one short.

186
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,635
Let's bring out the last member

187
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,512
of the<i> Survivor</i> favorites team,

188
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,639
the most infamous of all

189
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,016
survivors.

190
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,644
Jonny Fairplay, who already

191
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,687
looks intoxicated.

192
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,479
>> My grandmother is not here

193
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,690
for a reason.

194
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,483
She's not around.

195
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,651
>> Love the hat.

196
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,612
Love the hat.

197
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,655
>> JEFF: So, Fairplay, are you

198
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,323
dressing like me?

199
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,700
>> You want to know what you're

200
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,659
playing for?

201
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,787
(<i> laughter</i> )

202
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,997
>> JEFF: I'm actually impressed.

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,623
I like to know that you have

204
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,875
aspirations to get out of your

205
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,876
current place in life.

206
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,461
(<i> laughter</i> )

207
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:42,712
>> Wow.

208
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,338
Good to see you, Jeff.

209
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,423
Always a pleasure.

210
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,424
>> I wanted to throw up when I

211
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,466
saw Jonny Fairplay.

212
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,426
He's a pig.

213
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,343
He's a loser pig.

214
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:49,969
I would just love one moment to

215
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,888
kick him, one moment to kick

216
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,555
him.

217
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,682
One moment just to kick him hard

218
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,641
in the shin.

219
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,477
>> JEFF: All right, fans, your

220
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,562
tribe name is Airai.

221
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,608
Take a buff and put it on.

222
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,735
Favorites, your tribe name is

223
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,944
Malakal.

224
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,738
Take a buff and put it on.

225
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,741
>> I think the fans versus

226
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,076
favorites setup is the ultimate

227
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,911
challenge.

228
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,703
Because we have the favorites

229
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,663
who obviously have played this

230
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,706
game before, so they're coming

231
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,874
in here with experience, but at

232
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,500
the same time you have us.

233
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,710
And we know their game.

234
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,629
We know not only their strengths

235
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,339
but their weaknesses, too.

236
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,673
And so I think that puts us at a

237
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,383
huge advantage.

238
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:29,967
>> JEFF: Just across the water

239
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,844
on the other beach, there are

240
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,848
two boats, one for each tribe.

241
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,475
Inside the boat is a map to your

242
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,101
new home.

243
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,895
One other thing-- also across

244
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,939
the beach there are two

245
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,316
individual immunity idols, one

246
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,276
for each tribe.

247
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,778
The first person to find the

248
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,155
idol from each tribe gets the

249
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,490
idol.

250
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,325
These are special idols.

251
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,701
You can only play it the first

252
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,619
time you go to tribal council.

253
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,456
You can go anytime you want.

254
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,957
>> I worked my ass off to get

255
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,791
across that stretch of water.

256
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,959
I beat Ozzy.

257
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,835
And that's good.

258
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,961
That's what I wanted to do.

259
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:47,712
I needed to show him what I'm

260
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,880
made of.

261
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,804
>> I'm thinking, "You know what?

262
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,056
Take your time, Jonny Fairplay.

263
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,682
Slow and steady wins the race."

264
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,268
I get there, has to be in plain

265
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,769
sight.

266
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,188
It's on the boat.

267
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:06,772
I grab it.

268
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,773
Well, I grab the one from the

269
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,775
other boat.

270
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,948
Yau-Man tackles my head into the

271
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,158
side of the boat.

272
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,951
>> Sorry!

273
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,244
All these idols seem to like me,

274
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,620
and I hope that there will be

275
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,872
other idols on the way this

276
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,457
season and they will all like

277
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,709
me.

278
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,757
Pick up that!

279
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,469
>> Thanks to Yau-Man, I have

280
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,887
immunity for the very first

281
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,847
tribal council that we go to.

282
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,141
So I'm, like, safe.

283
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:46,896
>> Trust me, Yau-Man's not

284
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,688
America's hero like you think he

285
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,647
is.

286
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,523
Even Jonny Fairplay wouldn't

287
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,483
tackle someone's head into the

288
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,233
side of a boat for the immunity

289
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,987
idol.

290
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,114
Yau-Man is not nice.

291
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:57,990
He sucks.

292
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,658
So, as soon as that idol is

293
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,702
gone, see you later, bucko.

294
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,135
>> Here we go!

295
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,679
>> Get out.

296
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,515
Hi, nice to meet you, buddy.

297
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,641
>> Chet, Jason.

298
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,266
When we first pulled up to the

299
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,851
beach it was really exciting.

300
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,894
You know, we are the fans of

301
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,062
<i>Survivor.</i>

302
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:28,729
So this is all of our dreams to

303
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,730
be out here.

304
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,856
We definitely want to kick the

305
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,818
favorites' ass.

306
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,695
>> We have arrived.

307
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,238
>> As in we have arrived.

308
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,906
>> Arrived, arrived.

309
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,826
>> How about Jonny Fairplay?

310
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,078
>> Yeah.

311
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,079
>> I'm a fan.

312
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,038
I'm not somebody that just said,

313
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,164
"Oh, let's go be on<i> Survivor."</i>

314
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,457
>> Like, they all think they

315
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,125
know how to do it and that,

316
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,084
like, the way they did it was

317
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:50,292
right.

318
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,669
>> Exactly.

319
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,461
>> Now that we know we're

320
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,170
playing the favorites, I mean,

321
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:53,838
we are out for blood.

322
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,839
>> We have the advantage,

323
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,464
because we know how they play.

324
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,549
They don't know a damn thing

325
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,383
about us.

326
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,175
>> All right, let's do

327
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:58,968
something.

328
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,969
our tribe consists of Big Bird.

329
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,889
We've got the southern princess.

330
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,516
We've got the Incredible Hulk.

331
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,351
We've got Jon Bon Jovi in his

332
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,185
prime.

333
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:08,978
And then we've got Queer Eye for

334
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,354
the Straight Guy.

335
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,522
Man, this is going to be a crew,

336
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,107
let me tell you.

337
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,191
It's on!

338
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,901
>> I think we need to do an

339
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,153
elevated floor.

340
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:17,945
>> Wherever we build a shelter,

341
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,946
we've got to clear it out.

342
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,158
>> Okay.

343
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,371
>> Do you prefer gay?

344
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,080
I don't even know the right word

345
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:28,998
to use.

346
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,457
>> You're cool so far.

347
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,708
Go ahead.

348
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,500
I don't get offended, so don't

349
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,168
worry.

350
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:32,960
>> Is gay okay?

351
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:33,335
>> That's fine.

352
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,587
Sure.

353
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,379
>> It doesn't mean, like, you

354
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,088
want to be a girl, right?

355
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,006
>> Oh, no, no, heavens no.

356
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,717
>> I knew Chet was a homosexual

357
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,009
right away.

358
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:40,968
You know, you could just tell he

359
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,802
is.

360
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,888
Yeah, I don't have a problem

361
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,930
with it.

362
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:45,931
But I've never been friends

363
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,932
with a homosexual.

364
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,018
I think I worked with somebody

365
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,937
in the 1980s bartending that was

366
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,231
gay, but that's been about it.

367
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,357
You know what?

368
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,108
I hope you can be my first gay

369
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,109
man friend.

370
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,611
>> And I absolutely will.

371
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,321
>> Because I never had a gay man

372
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:00,988
friend.

373
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,947
>> I bet you have and you just

374
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:02,865
don't know.

375
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,866
>> Maybe.

376
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,951
>> Kathy definitely... she just

377
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,994
kind of puts her foot in her

378
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,621
mouth sometimes.

379
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,747
>> I've never seen implants,

380
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,831
ever.

381
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,957
I've never seen them up close.

382
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:16,253
>> Who said I have them?

383
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,671
>> She made... she made a

384
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,216
comment about Tracy's boobs.

385
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,843
And I'm like...

386
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,969
>> Oh, my god!

387
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,263
>> The second the crazy lady

388
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,015
found the immunity idol, I think

389
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,016
everyone was a little worried,

390
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,227
because I think we all kind of

391
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,020
felt as a consensus that she was

392
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,648
going to be its first one to go.

393
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,650
>> I'm sure I got off on the

394
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,235
wrong foot.

395
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,569
I guess sometimes it pays to

396
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,695
keep your mouth shut, but I

397
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,156
can't help myself.

398
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:52,873
>> So here.

399
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,959
Let's build a shelter before it

400
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,086
rains again.

401
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,091
>> The fact that we, the

402
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,093
favorites, have played this game

403
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,219
before, I think that is our

404
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,011
biggest advantage.

405
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,389
And it's an expectation that

406
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,807
we've got to live up to.

407
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,808
>> Can we just make a pact right

408
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,809
now that we're just going to

409
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,226
kick their asses?

410
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,019
>> Of course.

411
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,062
>> We should do our shelter as

412
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,063
fast as possible.

413
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,231
>> It's just out in the open?

414
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:17,982
>> Yeah.

415
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,900
>> I mean, like, do we have

416
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,901
people who know how to build a

417
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,069
shelter?

418
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,821
Let's build a real shelter.

419
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,239
Pretty crazy, fans versus

420
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,699
favorites.

421
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,825
We always knew Jonny Fairplay

422
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,243
was a favorite.

423
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,035
Honestly, I think that's the

424
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,036
smartest place, but, you know,

425
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,329
I'm not fighting anybody on

426
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,539
anything.

427
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,707
The first time around I was just

428
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,249
a single guy on the prowl.

429
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,210
This go-around I've got a

430
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,503
girlfriend at home.

431
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,213
She's seven months pregnant.

432
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,256
Need to bring home some money

433
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,507
for her.

434
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,509
So let's get to work.

435
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,471
I just got a message in a bottle

436
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,141
saying my grandma died, so...

437
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,726
>> Not falling for that one

438
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,228
again.

439
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,479
>> Are you kidding me?

440
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,647
Look at how fast he is.

441
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,107
>> I know, it's insane.

442
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,108
>> I definitely appreciate the

443
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,109
hard work that goes on around

444
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,028
this camp.

445
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,779
It's so much nicer to have

446
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,281
everybody pulling the rope and

447
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,866
getting everything together,

448
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,491
helping each other and stuff.

449
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,784
I almost wanted to give somebody

450
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,702
a hug, because it was really

451
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,119
nice.

452
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,913
>> Nice, Ozzy!

453
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,081
This is so much more pleasant

454
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,082
than day one of last time.

455
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,083
>> I know, right?

456
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:18,959
>> I mean, we all know what

457
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,462
we're doing already, so, I mean,

458
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,130
the favorites should definitely

459
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,089
have the advantage over the

460
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:24,298
fans.

461
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,591
>> We're pretty much ready for

462
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,300
palm fronds, right?

463
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,636
>> Yeah.

464
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,307
>> I think we have a good group.

465
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,099
I hope we win.

466
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,392
>> I think so, too.

467
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,185
Everyone's already, like,

468
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,187
bonding together.

469
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,355
I have to win this time.

470
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,272
It's my second time.

471
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,940
I'm not coming back here to

472
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,108
starve and be miserable.

473
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,193
Do you want to get more fronds?

474
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,528
I was the flirt on<i> Cook Islands</i>

475
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,072
and that was it.

476
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,156
Like, there was no other

477
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,115
dimension to me at all, I don't

478
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,784
think.

479
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,910
Do you want a piggyback?

480
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,120
>> Yeah.

481
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,830
>> (<i> laughing</i> )

482
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,956
Like, outwardly, I'm still going

483
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,000
to be flirty, but I'm playing

484
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,210
smart this time.

485
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,169
Like, I want to make the right

486
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,128
alliances with people that I

487
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,380
know I can trust.

488
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,005
Oh, look at that crab.

489
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,175
(<i> screaming</i> )

490
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,219
And this time there's only one

491
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,387
guy to flirt with, really.

492
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,639
It's the big guy, James.

493
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,099
>> No, don't.

494
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,433
>> He has, like, a pincher on

495
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,059
the bottom.

496
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,060
>> Parvati is definitely

497
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,937
attractive.

498
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,646
And she's... you know, there's

499
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,855
just something about her that...

500
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,439
she's one of them sex kitten-

501
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,110
type girls, and I like it.

502
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,783
>> I will be... I'll be totally

503
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,118
honest with you.

504
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,036
If you saw my season, you can

505
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,329
know that when I say I'm going

506
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,247
to stick to something and do

507
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,123
it...

508
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:39,373
>> Yeah.

509
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,250
I... you know what?

510
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,584
It's so funny that you're here,

511
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,544
because you're, like, one of my

512
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,420
favorite players.

513
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,421
I don't know, I think that's

514
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,213
really cool.

515
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,215
I'd say I have pretty keen

516
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,800
powers of observation, and from

517
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,218
what I can tell, Amanda and Ozzy

518
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,178
have this rapport with one

519
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,222
another already.

520
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,056
>> And you're, like, the loyal

521
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,349
one, you know?

522
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,767
Like, I think that's so awesome.

523
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,394
>> And ever since we got here,

524
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,187
Parvati hasn't been able to take

525
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:07,151
her hands or eyes off of James.

526
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,777
She is definitely going to have

527
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,154
him wrapped around her finger.

528
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,447
So I think there definitely

529
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,656
could be romance bubbling

530
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,615
between both Parvati and James

531
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,869
and Amanda and Ozzy.

532
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,453
And so that makes all four of

533
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,830
them very dangerous.

534
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,039
>> Good night, John Boy.

535
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,874
>> Good night, favorites.

536
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,376
>> Good night, favorites.

537
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,589
>> Palm fronds.

538
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,131
Do we need anything more?

539
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,132
>> Yeah, let's put the fronds on

540
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,301
the ground, too.

541
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,844
>> That's a good idea.

542
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,845
>> Is anybody over here?

543
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:35,929
>> Here comes another one.

544
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,264
>> Tonight is night number one,

545
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,308
and we kind of took a little too

546
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,809
long to find a location to build

547
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,269
our shelter, and it didn't come

548
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,980
along as planned.

549
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,737
>> Holy crap.

550
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,333
>> Tonight's the first night

551
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,419
here, and the downpour, it came

552
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,295
and it was hard, and it didn't

553
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,421
stop.

554
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:17,304
(<i> thunder</i> )

555
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,307
I hope by morning I feel a whole

556
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,183
lot better, because right now

557
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,353
this sucks.

558
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,605
(<i> crying</i> )

559
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,498
>> I know you are.

560
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,874
>> I think that...

561
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,000
>> This would be awesome.

562
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:47,543
>> We would be a really good

563
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,168
group.

564
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,962
>> Yeah, why don't we stick

565
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:50,712
together starting now?

566
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,338
>> Starting now?

567
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,173
>> We're not supposed to scheme

568
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:53,549
until tomorrow.

569
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,174
>> Come on, everyone else is

570
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,385
scheming.

571
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,302
>> I love it.

572
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,345
>> Hands in, I'll do it.

573
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:58,679
>> I'll do it.

574
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,138
>> I'll do it.

575
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:00,889
>> All right.

576
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,890
>> I love you guys.

577
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,724
>> I love you guys!

578
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,392
This is it.

579
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,769
>> Okay, done.

580
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,312
>> Ami, Yau-Man, Jonathan, and

581
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,773
myself, the four of us are a

582
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,358
tight alliance.

583
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,319
But the problem is, it seems

584
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,280
like there's another foursome

585
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,156
out here, and that is Amanda and

586
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,284
Ozzy and Parvati and James.

587
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,410
We're very concerned about that

588
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,578
foursome.

589
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,579
And we were worried they would

590
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,038
try to pull in Fairplay and

591
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,415
Cirie.

592
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,958
We need a fifth.

593
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,959
We need a fifth.

594
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:29,751
>> I say Fairplay.

595
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,502
Yeah.

596
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,503
>> Wait a minute.

597
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,504
>> Yeah.

598
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,714
We have turn on him before he

599
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,007
turns on us.

600
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,009
>> I don't trust him.

601
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,765
>> Okay.

602
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,601
So who all do we have?

603
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,394
>> Us three.

604
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,562
>> Yeah.

605
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,855
>> We can get James and Amanda

606
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,398
for sure.

607
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,984
One, two, three, four, five.

608
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,986
>> We are a little wary of Eliza

609
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,362
just hearing about the way she

610
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,324
played the game in Vanuatu.

611
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,409
She's shifty, crafty.

612
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,785
Some of us just feel like we

613
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,537
can't trust her.

614
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,580
>> I'm easy, man.

615
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,789
Trust me.

616
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,666
>> I'm a little nervous because

617
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,877
Fairplay's got his villain

618
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,378
persona to live up to, so maybe

619
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,880
he will just betray everyone he

620
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,173
can.

621
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,174
I don't know.

622
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,175
But at this point, we need

623
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,593
Fairplay to make a strong

624
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,802
alliance.

625
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,553
>> Let's go swimming.

626
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,387
>> Good.

627
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,388
>> So we were productive.

628
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,015
>> Yes.

629
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,851
>> Jonny Fairplay is sitting

630
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,895
back right now being friends

631
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,479
with everybody.

632
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,438
I'm a very likable person.

633
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,231
I'm a very nice person.

634
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,232
I just have the ability to lie

635
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,359
very easily, which comes in

636
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,402
handy here.

637
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,403
>> Hey, hey.

638
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:43,116
James, Amanda, Ozzy, and Parvati

639
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,409
are a done deal alliance of

640
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,577
four.

641
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,578
>> Absolutely.

642
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,371
>> Absolutely.

643
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,498
>> So we need to make a counter.

644
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,917
>> They want what?

645
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,127
>> Me.

646
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,337
>> Ozzy or Parvati.

647
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,047
It doesn't matter to me.

648
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,714
>> I say Parvati first.

649
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,840
>> I say Parvati, too.

650
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,592
>> With Parvati still in, she

651
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,594
can manipulate crap in the way

652
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,637
Ozzy could never...

653
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,388
I think we should take Parvati

654
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,431
out first.

655
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,433
I think Parvati is a much bigger

656
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,269
threat as a social player than

657
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,812
Ozzy is.

658
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,854
>> Fairplay pretends he's with

659
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,480
them, and I act like everything

660
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,399
is perfect.

661
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,608
>> I'll play the game.

662
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,526
>> Fairplay's a gem to have on

663
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,697
your alliance.

664
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,073
He needs us much more than we

665
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,032
need him.

666
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,908
You keep him around for as long

667
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,617
as possible.

668
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,410
Hell, I'd take Fairplay to the

669
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,411
end if I could.

670
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,246
Do they think you are with them?

671
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:29,496
>> Yeah.

672
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,874
>> I think it's insane that

673
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,669
there's nine other of your

674
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,837
favorite Survivors of all time,

675
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,255
and they all believe what I say.

676
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,548
Have you not watched the show

677
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,717
before?

678
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,350
>> Yau-Man!

679
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,435
Do you think you have enough sun

680
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,561
you can start with your glasses?

681
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,938
>> I can feel burning.

682
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,566
I'm trying to focus the sun onto

683
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,444
this quote, unquote dry coconut

684
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,529
husk with a drop of water on my

685
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,865
glasses to act as a magnifying

686
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,574
glass.

687
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,367
It's a very nice magnifying

688
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,785
glass.

689
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,537
The sun is almost vertical

690
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,497
enough that this should work.

691
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,917
It worked in Fiji.

692
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,377
>> It's so warm.

693
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,462
>> I know.

694
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,671
It's unbelievably warm.

695
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,547
>> It's like pee water.

696
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,507
>> Wow, it's burning.

697
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,467
>> Yeah, Yau-Man.

698
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,927
Yeah.

699
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,554
Yo, we need wood.

700
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,722
>> Oh, my god!

701
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,098
>> Oh, my god, they started it.

702
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:30,515
>> Woo!

703
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,601
>> Yea.

704
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,518
>> Good job, dude.

705
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,936
>> Yau-Man got our fire started

706
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,104
miraculously.

707
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:36,605
We're all very excited.

708
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,439
We have fire.

709
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,232
We've been eating.

710
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,108
We've been drinking.

711
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:40,817
We're all well rested, well

712
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,568
hydrated, and we're ready to

713
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,570
kick some butt.

714
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,705
>> I hope we have something.

715
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,045
>> We have tree mail.

716
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,004
>> Woo!

717
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,130
Yes!

718
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,548
Hey, guys, we've got tree mail!

719
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,633
>> Hey, we got tree mail.

720
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,550
>> Tree mail!

721
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,927
>> It's a puzzle.

722
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,512
>> Yeah, I love puzzles.

723
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,763
>> It says, "16 seasons later,

724
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,598
you all should know the deal.

725
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,059
Outwit, outplay, outlast.

726
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:14,684
Don't waste time reinventing the

727
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,645
wheel."

728
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,230
>> I think everybody is, you

729
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:18,855
know, biting at the bit just to

730
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,606
get in the game.

731
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,608
And I think the favorites are

732
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,652
chuckling at us right now,

733
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,237
saying that we're going to be a

734
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,238
piece of cake, that they're

735
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,239
going to walk all over us.

736
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,532
>> "Don't reinvent the wheel"

737
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,783
means don't be stupid.

738
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,784
>> It means don't be too smart.

739
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,953
Don't outthink yourself.

740
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,954
>> They're not looking at us as

741
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,830
competitors.

742
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,622
But that's good.

743
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,540
Even better-- underdog, we'll

744
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,959
take that role.

745
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,466
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

746
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,637
<i>Deja vu.</i>

747
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,973
(<i> laughter</i> )

748
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,025
So here we are, our first

749
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,111
challenge.

750
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,404
Eliza, you guys have played this

751
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,280
game before.

752
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,239
Did you see the advantage you

753
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:09,865
had now in getting a shelter up

754
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,575
quickly?

755
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,826
>> Jeff, have no idea how much

756
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,869
of an advantage we have.

757
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,412
Not only do we have a shelter,

758
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,496
but we have fire, we have food,

759
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,039
we all have full bellies.

760
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,833
We are so excited and so pumped

761
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,001
for this challenge, ready to

762
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,335
kick some butt.

763
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:22,961
>> We're doing three courses for

764
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,713
every meal.

765
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,839
It's ridiculous.

766
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,798
I'm getting fat.

767
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,632
I have gained weight since I've

768
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,800
been here.

769
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,926
>> JEFF: Joel, you buying all

770
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,303
this?

771
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,471
>> No.

772
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,680
>> (<i> laughter</i> )

773
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,639
>> You guys are dumber than you

774
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,724
look.

775
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,602
>> But, hey, you know, if it is,

776
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,644
good for them.

777
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,896
They can get fat and happy, and

778
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,440
we can win the challenges.

779
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,691
>> JEFF: Here's how it works--

780
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,067
on my go, you must race to

781
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,528
assemble four wheels and place

782
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,488
them on your cart.

783
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,740
You must then push your cart

784
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,491
through a series of obstacles.

785
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,618
When you reach the sand pit you

786
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,037
must dig up a bundle of planks.

787
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,122
You'll use the planks to fill in

788
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,957
gaps in the bridge.

789
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,876
Push your cart over your bridge

790
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,045
to the finished platform, where

791
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,339
you must then take the wheels

792
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,757
off of your cart and use them to

793
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,759
complete a turnstile.

794
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,385
Finally, you'll use the

795
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,511
turnstile to raise a fire wok,

796
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,012
lighting the top of the

797
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,639
platform.

798
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,723
First tribe to finish wins.

799
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,642
You know to know what you're

800
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,559
playing for?

801
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,894
>> Yes!

802
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,979
>> JEFF: Immunity.

803
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,357
When you have immunity in your

804
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,982
possession, you cannot be voted

805
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,193
out.

806
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,569
In addition, the winning tribe

807
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,613
gets fire in the form of flint.

808
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,782
All right, give you a minute to

809
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,700
strategize.

810
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,369
>> Come on, guys, right here.

811
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,328
Right here.

812
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,496
>> Kick this some fan ass right

813
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:39,788
now.

814
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,747
>> JEFF: Here we go, the first

815
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,581
challenge of fans versus

816
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,375
favorites.

817
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,417
Survivors ready?

818
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,544
Go!

819
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,838
>> Go, go, go, go!

820
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,718
>> JEFF: Have to assemble the

821
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,011
four wheels, then put them on

822
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:55,595
your cart.

823
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,389
>> Come on, come on, come on,

824
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,598
come on!

825
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,726
>> I got it, I got it, I got it.

826
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,811
>> Come on, guys, quickly,

827
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,687
quickly!

828
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,104
>> Take your time.

829
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,689
>> Stand back and look at it.

830
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,982
>> Guys, guys, guys!

831
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,191
>> We got it.

832
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,567
>> JEFF: Fans have their four

833
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,902
wheels.

834
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,778
>> Amanda, behind you!

835
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,821
Behind you, Amanda!

836
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,822
>> JEFF: Favorites having no

837
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,990
luck putting their four wheels

838
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,908
together.

839
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,034
>> Come on, guys.

840
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,035
It's okay.

841
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,828
Take your time!

842
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,829
Calm down.

843
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,121
Look at it!

844
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:21,788
Look at it!

845
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,790
>> All right, take your time.

846
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,749
>> Let's go!

847
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,459
>> Come on, guys!

848
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,460
We've got this.

849
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,129
>> JEFF: The fans are off.

850
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:29,671
Favorites still working.

851
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,589
>> Relax.

852
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,757
>> JEFF: Falling behind.

853
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,175
>> Look at that one.

854
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,385
>> JEFF: Fans extending their

855
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,596
lead.

856
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,181
>> Come on!

857
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,599
>> We can still do it, you guys.

858
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,018
We can still do it.

Jason, Joel, Mikey B tearing it

862
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,567
up.

863
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,484
>> One, two, three!

864
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,404
>> Here comes the cart, rolling

865
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,739
over their tribe.

Yes!

They are back in this!

875
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:15,717
>> Whoa!

876
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,261
>> JEFF: An absolute wipeout for

877
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,679
the favorites.

879
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,474
>> JEFF: This challenge is

880
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,225
falling apart for the favorites.

881
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,602

course after a big wipeout.

>> Come on, guys.

890
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,074
We still can do this.

891
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:39,908
>> Go to your right.

892
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,867
Go to your right a little bit.

893
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,910

tribe continues to work with the

907

planks.

908
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,684
Fans are very much in control,

909
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,103
taking their time.

910

Fans working together very well.

952
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:26,848
>> Turn them around.

953
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,933
>> Pull the cart up!

954
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,312
>> JEFF: Got to finish the

955
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,023
turnstile using the pieces of

956
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,025
the wheels.

957
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,029
Fans getting closer.

958
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,363
Favorites now quickly trying to

959
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,532
work on their puzzle.

960
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,159
>> Go!

961
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:46,826
>> JEFF: Fans have their

962
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,996
turnstile complete.

963
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,122
They've got to raise the wok to

964
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:51,956
the top of the platform.

965
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,833
Favorites trying to get into

966
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:58,755
this.

967
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,048
The first immunity challenge...

968
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:04,010
is won by the fans!

969
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,609
>> JEFF: Fans, congratulations.

970
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,985
Immunity.

971
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,822
Nobody going home tonight.

972
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,950
And fire in the form of flint.

973
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,785
(<i> cheering</i> )

974
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,702
>> JEFF: Favorites, you know

975
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,996
this drill.

976
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,039
Date with me tonight at tribal

977
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,040
council, where one of the

978
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,167
favorites will have the

979
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,210
distinction as being the first

980
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,670
person voted out of Fans versus

981
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,087
Favorites.

982
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,797
Grab your stuff.

983
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,464
Head back to camp.

984
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,591
See you tonight at tribal.

985
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,860
>> That sucked.

986
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,405
>> We tried hard, lost.

987
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,448
no shame in losing.

988
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,119
These fans are so excited, so

989
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,870
enthusiastic.

990
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,371
I mean, they're playing

991
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:13,955
<i>Survivor.</i>

992
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:14,914
It's their dream.

993
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,082
And they just had more heart out

994
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,041
there.

995
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,127
>> The loss, it's going to

996
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,421
humble us and make us ready to

997
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:21,963
kick ass in the next one.

998
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,215
>> I may not swim as well as

999
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,969
Ozzy, but I think I did pretty

1000
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,095
good today.

1001
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,097
>> Yeah, you did.

1002
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,849
>> We're going to tribal council

1003
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,269
and gosh, I do not have a plan

1004
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,478
at all.

1005
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,230
I have no idea what I'm going to

1006
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,648
do right now.

1007
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,025
I don't really trust any of

1008
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,901
these people.

1009
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:44,944
I don't care.

1010
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,945
I'll get rid of anybody, as long

1011
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,238
as it's not me.

1012
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,364
>> What am I good at?

1013
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,157
>> Yeah.

1014
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,325
>> I think I'm good for morale,

1015
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,118
entertainment value.

1016
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,745
That's about it.

1017
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,163
(<i> laughter</i> )

1018
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,664
Right now, I could go either way

1019
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,041
and totally change the game in

1020
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,293
two different directions.

1021
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,794
Two groups I'm playing are the

1022
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,047
four of Yau-Man, Eliza,

1023
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,215
Jonathan, Ami.

1024
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,927
>> Yep.

1025
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,095
>> Yep.

1026
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,472
>> And then you have the

1027
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,515
alliance of Ozzy, James, Parvati

1028
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,267
and Amanda.

1029
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,393
They're after Eliza.

1030
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,102
So we'll see.

1031
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,979
People don't understand, like,

1032
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,022
what crazy thing are you going

1033
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,483
to do?

1034
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,525
I'm like, how about the crazy

1035
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,610
thing is, I don't do anything?

1036
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:26,778
I just want to see my

1037
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,737
girlfriend.

1038
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,197
That's it.

1039
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,156
>> You must miss her really bad?

1040
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,991
>> Yeah.

1041
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,910
She's seven months pregnant, and

1042
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:34,786
like, you know, I don't know

1043
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,036
anything.

1044
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,996
I think about my girlfriend and

1045
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,084
my upcoming little girl every

1046
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,336
single second out here, and I

1047
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,962
want to win this game for them.

1048
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,048
I can't stop thinking that maybe

1049
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,132
there's something wrong with my

1050
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:52,303
little girl.

1051
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,554
(<i> crying</i> )

1052
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,555
I'll tell you what, a million

1053
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,390
dollars is great.

1054
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,432
But having a healthy little

1055
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,850
girl, that's the biggest prize I

1056
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,227
could win right now.

1057
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,322
>> Shut up.

1058
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,573
You'll ruin our whole plan.

1059
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,411
Maybe you should, though.

1060
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,381
>> What's that?

1061
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,048
>> Yeah.

1062
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,134
>> I don't know.

1063
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,468
I mean, it might be just too

1064
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,387
crazy, but I came up with this

1065
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,389
little plan to distract

1066
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:39,559
Jonathan, Eliza, Yau-Man, and

1067
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,060
Ami into voting for Fairplay,

1068
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,104
and we're all voting for Eliza,

1069
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,481
just because I don't want Eliza

1070
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,232
turning around and trying to,

1071
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:50,361
you know, snake me.

1072
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,156
>> I mean, having a kid is a

1073
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,782
pretty powerful thing.

1074
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,575
>> Yeah.

1075
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,284
>> You know?

1076
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,243
>> Yeah.

1077
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:57,785
>> I'm just emotionally not

1078
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,077
here.

1079
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,912
So, I mean, I'm sorry.

1080
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,621
>> Yeah.

1081
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,624
>> I'm just... I can't... you

1082
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,917
know.

1083
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,085
>> Is there any way that I can

1084
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,131
talk you into staying in?

1085
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,549
>> No.

1086
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,342
I'm sorry.

1087
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,929
>> Yeah, it sucks.

1088
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,932
Fairplay is a loose cannon.

1089
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,309
Fairplay said to me that he

1090
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,310
wanted to go home.

1091
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,270
He just puts you on your serious

1092
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,105
stance guard, because you don't

1093
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,941
know ever what he means.

1094
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:29,567
>> He does not want to be here.

1095
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,318
>> He doesn't want to stay?

1096
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,111
>> He does not want to stay.

1097
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:32,737
>> Or is he just saying that so

1098
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,946
we all vote for him and he is

1099
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,826
with them?

1100
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,329
We've just got to be careful

1101
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,207
because he could pull a fast

1102
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,416
one.

1103
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,667
I've just got to make sure he

1104
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,085
doesn't do anything crazy.

1105
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,545
I'm a little worried that

1106
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,129
Fairplay is going to come

1107
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,508
together with James, Ozzy,

1108
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,760
Amanda, and Parvati.

1109
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,512
All I know is tonight, tribal

1110
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,055
council is going to be crazy,

1111
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,264
because if I know Jonny

1112
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,516
Fairplay, he is going to stir

1113
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,934
things up.

1114
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,060
>> I'm ready.

1115
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,186
Let's battle!

1116
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,648
Tribal council!

1117
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:36,634
>> JEFF: Behind each of you is a

1118
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,176
torch.

1119
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,011
Go ahead and grab a torch,

1120
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,930
approach the flame.

1121
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:41,556
This is part of the ritual of

1122
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,307
tribal council, because in this

1123
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,601
game, fire represents your life.

1124
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,355
As long as you have that fire,

1125
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,315
you're in the game.

1126
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:51,899
When your fire is gone, so are

1127
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,610
you.

1128
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,990
Jonny Fairplay, you guys have

1129
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,448
all played this game.

1130
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,325
Everybody here should come in

1131
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,577
fairly well versed in terms of

1132
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,786
what is required.

1133
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,412
How did it go when you got to

1134
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,622
camp?

1135
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,623
>> Cake.

1136
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,041
I mean, food is a lot easier

1137
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,543
here.

1138
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,170
We've made an amazing shelter.

1139
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,922
So I think our only problem was,

1140
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,425
I'm guessing, over-confidence.

1141
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,926
>> JEFF: Eliza, let's talk about

1142
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,219
past reputations.

1143
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,221
How big a factor are reputations

1144
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,431
coming into this game?

1145
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,850
>> It's definitely a factor.

1146
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,727
I mean, whether or not somebody

1147
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,352
says, "Oh, I'm just going to get

1148
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,228
to know you for you," it doesn't

1149
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,980
matter.

1150
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:31,814
That's going to be in the back

1151
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,565
of their head.

1152
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,608
They're going to remember the

1153
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,400
things you do, the moves you

1154
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,526
made, how you interacted with

1155
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,611
people, and that's going to

1156
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,737
probably play a factor in the

1157
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,821
way people vote.

1158
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,780
>> JEFF: Jonny Fairplay,

1159
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,199
probably nobody in this game has

1160
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,743
a bigger reputation than you.

1161
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,952
>> I agree.

1162
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,621
>> JEFF: Can that be an

1163
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,663
advantage?

1164
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,289
>> Honestly, I think everyone

1165
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,875
here was kind of surprised with

1166
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,585
the real Jonny Fairplay, I

1167
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,086
guess, and I can easily say I

1168
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,630
feel that all of them trust me.

1169
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,089
But at the same time, like, my

1170
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,591
head's kind of screwed up right

1171
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,675
now.

1172
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,844
I have a little baby on the way.

1173
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,470
And honestly, all I think about,

1174
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,472
"Is my little baby Piper okay?"

1175
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,765
You know, like, that's all that

1176
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,099
goes through my head.

1177
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,685
I'm like, you know, "Am I being

1178
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,187
a crappy dad by being here?"

1179
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,605
>> JEFF: But you're not a father

1180
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,272
yet.

1181
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,566
>> Yeah, I'm this close.

1182
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,652
I mean, I had no idea that I was

1183
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,028
going to think like this once I

1184
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,237
got here.

1185
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,280
I mean, I don't have a kid.

1186
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,281
I'm about to have one, and guess

1187
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,282
what?

1188
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:23,658
It changes you.

1189
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,450
It changes your head.

1190
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,369
It makes you crazy.

1191
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,787
>> JEFF: So you want to go home,

1192
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,371
or you had a bad afternoon and

1193
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,581
now you're trying to recover?

1194
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,791
>> You know, last time I learned

1195
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,708
to be Jonny Fairplay and be an

1196
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,834
ass (<i> no audio</i> ).

1197
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,710
This time, you know, what?

1198
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,628
If I learn to be a good dad, so

1199
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,837
be it.

1200
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,797
So I mean, I'm just... you know,

1201
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,339
my head is screwy right now.

1202
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,508
>> JEFF: Why are you smiling,

1203
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,592
Yau-Man?

1204
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,927
>> Well, because my first

1205
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,552
thought is, you know, what's the

1206
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,806
scheme?

1207
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,807
It's a very strange thing to say

1208
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,641
to us suddenly just out of the

1209
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,934
blue.

1210
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,143
>> JEFF: Ozzy, is this just

1211
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,478
simply a case of Fairplay can't

1212
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,312
hack it, it's much harder than

1213
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,731
he remembered, and he wanted to

1214
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,692
go home?

1215
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,610
>> Jeff, I'll honestly tell you,

1216
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,070
no, I don't think so.

1217
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:01,946
>> You can say what you want,

1218
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:02,738
Jeff.

1219
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,823
I don't need to put on a little

1220
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,157
show for you.

1221
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,660
I mean, honestly, like, I'm

1222
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,494
screwy right now.

1223
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,454
You know, emotions are going

1224
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,497
crazy in my head, and that's it.

1225
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,124
And it wasn't supposed to be

1226
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:13,541
this difficult.

1227
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,960
>> JEFF: Jonathan, Fairplay has

1228
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,838
a reputation of pulling scams

1229
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,047
and lying.

1230
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:20,589
Just to be clear, what is he

1231
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,633
doing?

1232
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,467
>> I think he's asking us to

1233
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,468
vote for him.

1234
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,344
I think, you know, somebody has

1235
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,429
to go home.

1236
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,638
Somebody wants to go home.

1237
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,180
And he's going to go home.

1238
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,474
>> JEFF: So it's a quit?

1239
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,143
>> This is not a quit.

1240
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,936
>> JEFF: Forgive my skepticism,

1241
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,939
but last time you cried over a

1242
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,941
dead grandma who conveniently

1243
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,484
was at home watching on TV.

1244
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,819
>> I understand.

1245
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,988
>> JEFF: Yes or no answer-- is

1246
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:44,739
this a quit?

1247
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,865
Eliza?

1248
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,741
>> No.

1249
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,742
>> JEFF: This is not a quit?

1250
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,576
>> There is still a possibility

1251
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,618
in my mind that Fairplay is not

1252
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,162
going home tonight.

1253
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,329
I mean, I don't think there's

1254
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,330
one person who didn't bring

1255
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:53,789
their stuff with them.

1256
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,416
So we're still voting.

1257
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,001
>> JEFF: Oh, we are voting.

1258
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,254
All right, Yau-Man, you have the

1259
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:02,381
immunity idol.

1260
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,008
It is only good tonight.

1261
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,426
You can use it for yourself...

1262
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,927
>> No, I'm keeping it.

1263
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,803
>> JEFF: All right, you cannot

1264
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,637
vote for Yau-Man.

1265
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,513
Everybody else, including Mr.

1266
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,389
Fairplay, is fair game.

1267
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:10,765
It's time to vote.

1268
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,060
Ami, you're up.

1269
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,501
>> Jonny I've got to vote for

1270
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,377
you.

1271
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,087
You've asked me to.

1272
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:41,962
I wish you the best of luck,

1273
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,091
and...

1274
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,651
>> Jonny, if you need any advice

1275
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,861
how to raise a baby to be a

1276
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,280
happy and well-adjusted child, I

1277
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:08,864
will be very happy to give you

1278
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,491
some advice.

1279
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,742
Thank you.

1280
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,637
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1281
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,764
votes.

1282
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,647
Once the votes are read, the

1283
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,022
decision is final.

1284
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:42,606
The person voted out will be

1285
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,358
asked to leave the tribal

1286
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,651
council area immediately.

1287
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,157
First vote, Fairplay.

1288
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,452
Fairplay.

1289
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,662
Two votes Fairplay.

1290
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,460
That's three votes Fairplay.

1291
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,881
Fairplay.

1292
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,175
Four votes Fairplay.

1293
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,971
Fairplay.

1294
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,390
That's five votes Fairplay.

You need to grab your torch.

1300
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,324
Jonny Fairplay, the tribe has

1301
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,451
spoken.

1302
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,786

have predicted that.

1308
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,013
Good news is because you've been

1309
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:56,722
to tribal council, you get fire

1310
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,017
in the form of flint.

1311
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,101
Yau-Man, you can leave that idol

1312
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:01,977
behind.

1313
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,686
It's of no use anymore.

1314
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,312
Grab your torches, head back to

1315
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:03,729

1316
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,273

00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,127
the time and not working?

1323
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,170
>> JEFF: The fans are in

1324
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,129
turmoil.

1325
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:29,755
>> Emotionally, it's not good

1326
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,632
for me to be here.

1327
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,633
>> JEFF: The rules have changed

1328
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,926
at Exile Island.

1329
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,636
Two people, one idol.

1330
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:35,844
>> Wow.

1331
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,389
>> JEFF: And two castaways have

1332
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:38,806
a night to remember.

1333
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,809
>> Go get a hotel room.

1334
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,607
>> I definitely feel I did the

1335
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,608
right thing.

1336
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,360
I had every single person here

1337
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:51,944
eating out of the palm of my

1338
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,863
hand, and to go out on my own

1339
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,365
terms, I'm very happy with that.

1340
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,449
No regrets at all.

1341
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,075
Last time I was the biggest bad

1342
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,827
guy ever, and this time I'm a

1343
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,787
responsible adult that people

1344
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,956
liked, some even loved.

1345
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,791
What's going on in the world?
