00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:05,405
Well, last season birthed
a new era of<i> Survivor.</i>

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,710
<i>26 days,</i>
<i>a relentless pace, no food...</i>

10
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,091
we shoot two seasons
back-to-back,

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,228
which means this new group
of players for 42

12
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,498
has not seen anything
that happened in 41.

13
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,267
So we're going to use that
to our advantage in this way.

14
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,269
Some twists
will remain the same,

15
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,671

<i>that you have to say</i>

16

<i>But other twists,</i>

we're going to change
the variables a little bit

20
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,949
to see if it changes
how the players respond.

21
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,619
<i>And some twists will be new.</i>

22
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,124

your challenge game,

out and is more well-rounded

143

168
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,576
And on the end,
wearing blue-- Ika.

169
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,445
-(whooping)
-Yeah!

170
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,881
All right, are you ready
to get to your first test

171
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,819
-as brand-new tribes?
-ALL: Yeah!

172
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,821
All right,
here's what's going to happen.

173
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,691
On my go, one person
from each tribe is going to race

174
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,294
<i>into the jungle</i>
<i>and untie two paddles</i>

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,929
<i>from a cargo net.</i>

176
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,031
<i>They'll come back.</i>
<i>Another person from that tribe</i>

177
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,433
<i>will then race down</i>
<i>around the far end of the beach</i>

178
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,734
<i>and get two more paddles.</i>

179
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,403
<i>When you're back</i>
<i>with your paddles,</i>

180
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,706
<i>everybody gets in your boat</i>
<i>and you paddle out</i>

181
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,143
<i>and around the buoy, collecting</i>
<i>a bag of bamboo sticks.</i>

182
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,878
<i>One tribe member</i>
<i>will use those sticks</i>

183
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,381
<i>to try to retrieve that flint.</i>

184
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,885
<i>First tribe member to get</i>
<i>a flint earns for their tribe</i>

185
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,654
-a pot, a machete and a flint.
-Oh, my.

186
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,623
That's what you're starting
the game with.

187
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,725
-No rice.
-(laughs)

188
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,993
-No food source.
-Wow.

189
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,829
PROBST:
You haven't seen<i> Survivor 41.</i>

190
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,832
You're going to be on your own.
The new<i> Survivor</i>

191
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:24,170
is fast, it's difficult,
and it's dangerous.

192
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,672
<i>OMAR: I don't know</i>
<i>about season 41, but</i>

193
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,774
watching 40 seasons of<i> Survivor,</i>
you have a general idea.

194
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,476
But when Jeff says,

195
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,846
<i>that's out the window, and</i>
<i>you don't know what to expect--</i>

196
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,181
<i>this is just wild.</i>

197
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,916
All right, tell me
who are the first runners

198
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,284
for the first leg?
Come right up here

199
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,785
in front of the green.

200
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,187
-Come on, my brother.
-Right next to each other.

201
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,622
Jonathan.

202
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,657
-(whooping)
-All right, Jonathan!

203
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,692
-All right, Daniel.
-Yeah, let's go, Daniel!

204
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,160
He's pretty big, you know.

205
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,162
I got to win one
for the short guys here.

206
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,332
-(laughs)
-We have Jonathan, Daniel...

207
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,668
-Yes.
-...and Tori gonna race
on the first leg.

208
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,670
-Tori, you got this.
-Go, Jonathan!
-First challenge

209
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:03,009
of<i> Survivor 42</i>
for basic camp supplies.

210
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,878
Here we go.
Survivors ready.

211
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,481
-Yes.
-Go.

212
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,850
-ROCKSROY: Go, Tori!
-Jonathan, Daniel and Tori.

213
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,653
ROCKSROY:
Yeah, Tori! (whoops)

214
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,022
Two paddles tied to a cargo net.

215
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,160
-(whooping, clapping)
-MARYANNE: Jonathan!

216
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,828
You got this, Jonathan!

PROBST:
The early moments
of<i> Survivor 42.</i>

218
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,233
You have no idea
what's happening back there.

219
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,635
-Jonathan!
-You've sent a relative stranger

220
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,737
-to represent your tribe.
-(whooping)

221
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,606
Who will come back first?

222
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,840
-Let's go, Tori!
-(whooping)

223
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,309
Come on, Tori!

224
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,744
(Tori grunts)

225
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,780
-(whooping)
-ROCKSROY: Come on!

226
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,748
Oh!

227
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,618
-Let's go, Daniel!
-Come on, Daniel!

228
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,354
-Come on!
-Keep it up! Keep it up!

229
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,588
-Come on, Daniel!
-Here it is!

230
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,291
Jonathan with Tori right behind.

231
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,926
You're good. Go!

232
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,263
It's gonna be Lindsay.
Here comes Tori.

233
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,700
You got to get there! Go.
Here comes Drea.

234
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,168
MARYANNE:
Go, Lindsay! Go, Lindsay! Go!

235
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,669
Go, Lindsay!
Go, Lindsay! Go!

236
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,272
PROBST:
Down and around the beach

237
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,040
trying to get two more paddles.

238
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,309
-(overlapping shouting)
-We're waiting for Daniel.

239
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,877
Here comes Daniel.

240
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,647
Got to get back.
Daniel takes a fall.

241
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,283
-Keep digging, brother.
You're on<i> Survivor.</i>
-HAI: Got it.

242
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,151
-Drop it, drop it, drop it.
-Go. Hai's gonna head out now.

243
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,988
Go, Hai!

244
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,756
Get the pad...
Get the paddles ready.

245
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,327
You're okay. You're okay.

246
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,463
JACKSON:
Come on, Lindsay!

247
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,397
MARYANNE:
You got this!

248
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,799
JACKSON:
Lindsay!

249
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,405
I sprint, and I run around,
and I get there.

250
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,208
<i>And then, all of a sudden,</i>
<i>I see that there's this thing</i>

251
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,510
<i>that says you have to make</i>

252
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,511
<i>this decision,</i>
<i>but you have to wait</i>

253
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,445
<i>till everyone else gets there.</i>

254
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,347
I'm like,
"That's a huge twist," but

255
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,018
<i>clearly this is a much more</i>
<i>dangerous version of this game.</i>

256
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,686
Okay.

257
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,610
-HAI: Okay.
-Well...

258
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,845
Hai, let's go!

259
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,680
Pros are,
we all have an advantage.

260
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,383
-JENNY: Come on! Let's go, Hai!
-Right, and also, con is

261
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,419
we are now being deceitful
immediately if...

262
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,920
-HAI: That's the game.
-We play... We came

263
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,221
-to play the game, though.
-(overlapping shouting)

264
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,623
But go with your gut.

265
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,226
My gut is that
it's only 26 days.

266
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,728
-Going fast.
-And that as long

267
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,029
as we get to merge

268
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,066
and the three of us know
and only the three of us know...

269
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,634
-It has to stay,
just the three of us.
-I got y'all.

270
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,402
-Five finger.
-Otherwise we...

271
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,237
-we all crash and burn.
-Can you touch his pinkie?
-Pinkie.

272
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,206
<i>HAI:</i>
<i>This was an opportunity to build</i>

273
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,875
two instant connections
on other tribes.

274
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,912
<i>So for me</i>
<i>there was no other choice</i>

275
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,113
except to do it.

276
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,049
Hey, what's the lie?

277
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,049
Wait. What's the lie?

278
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,555
DREA:
This is awesome! Wait. Let's

279
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,591
-help each other out here.
-Yo, this one is a long ride.

280
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,960
-It is. Man.
-Row.

281
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,929
A long time to get back.

282
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,632
Rest of the tribe can do nothing
until their tribe member is back

283
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,301
with those two paddles.

284
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,069
-This is mud. Here, get it on.
-(Hai mumbles)

285
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,305
(laughs)

286
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,773
-Wait.
-Oh, it's so cute.

287
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,441
-But I'm sorry.
-Yeah, just do it.

288
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,642
-Who cares?
-Wait. They're gonna be like,

289
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,111
-"What kind of freaking...?"
-Put it on my face, too.

290
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,579
-Oh!
-It has to look like...

291
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,980
All right, we have
to make it believable.

292
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,316
-Otherwise it's-it's obv...
-We can't just... Shh.

293
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,684
No one's back yet.

294
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,153
I've been on such a strict
skin care routine.

295
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,188
-This is good. It's mud.
-Oh, yeah, you're right.

296
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,990
Oh, my God.
I hope they're okay.

297
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,161
(grunting, laughter)

298
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,363
Wow. This is a hell of a run
you sent 'em on, Jeff.

299
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,365
(laughter)

300
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,268
Oh, my God. Come on.
No. You have to.

301
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,937
-DREA: Okay.
-HAI: Okay, I'll do that.

302
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,774
Oh, yeah.

303
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,176
Like, we have to do it.
This doesn't...

304
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,711
This doesn't look good at all.

305
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,045
Should we check on them?

306
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,853
(panting)

307
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,989
-Lindsay!
-(cheering, screaming)

308
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,724
Oh, and it's Lindsay back
first.

309
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,561
Here comes Drea and Hai.

-MIKE: Come on, Hai.
-PROBST: You're good.

00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,972
You're good.
Everybody in your boats.

317
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,945

PROBST:
All six people going

319
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,884
It's going to be Taku
in the water first.

320
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,253
You got to go out
and around the buoy.

321
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,256
Get your bamboo sticks
on the way back.

322
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,758
Now we're straying.
Let's all go...

323
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,526
PROBST:
Ika is way off course.

324
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,496
They're struggling
just to not go backwards.

325
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,531
Stop paddling. Stop. Left. Stop.
Right, right, right.

326
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,033

-Go.

It is Vati and Ika
in second place,

330
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,278
but Taku in the clear lead
right now.

331
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,846
Come on. Come on, come on.

332
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,548

You got to get

You got to tie up.

354

PROBST:
Taku trying to get close
to that rope.

355
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,240
Look at that.
A miscalculation

356
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,009
about where they came in.

357
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,345
Jonathan literally
dragging that boat over

358
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,348
so he can walk in.

359
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,384

367
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,134
One person now.

368
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,102
-Come on, Marya.
-Gonna be Marya using

369
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,139
the bamboo sticks. You're gonna
have to build a pole

370
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,509
that is long enough and strong
enough to reach that flint

371
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,377
and get it back to you.

372
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,846

And Ika in blue now

376
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,490
Ika has their bamboo sticks.
They're heading back.

377
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,392
Taku with the early lead.

378
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,161
(whooping)
Tak-Tak-Taku!

379
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:06,165
Go, go!

380
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,600
Keep digging. You've got

381
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,236
-to be tied in.
-One, two. Go, go, go. Come on.

382
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,005

-PROBST:
Daniel clearly injured.
-Come on!

384
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,175
-Push!
-PROBST: That fall he took

385
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,211
in the beginning--
that right shoulder looks lame.

386
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,279
Got it. Got it.

387
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,880
-Come on.
-Let's go.

388
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,283
Hai now starting to work

389
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,319

00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,888
Marya with a big lead

391
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,125
of time, allowing her
to work on her bamboo pole.

392
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,327
-You got it, girl.
-Yeah, can you give it a go?

393
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,797
Trying to see how much more
distance she needs.

394
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,933
-She is not close.
-MIKE: All right,
you better move it, Hai.

395
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,102
-Hai!
-Hai!
-Hai and Rocksroy are gaining.

396
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,505
It would be a huge comeback
for Ika

397
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,006
and a huge comeback for Vati

398
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,642
'cause they were
really out of it.

399
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,345
-Good job, Rocksroy!
-PROBST: Marya
absolutely patient.

400
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,314
Does she have it this time?

401
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,649
-It's looking better.
-There you go.

402
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,185
She's got to get it high enough
to hook that ring.

403
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,788
Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

404
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,189
PROBST:
Hai now gonna give it a go.

405
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,858
And here comes Rocksroy.

406
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,993
All three tribes are in it.

407
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,130
This is what you want minutes
into<i> Survivor 42.</i>

408
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,498
-Oh, yeah, baby!
-PROBST: Rocksroy

409
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,467
-literally
a half an inch away.
-Got it?

410
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,169
-(overlapping shouting)
-PROBST: Closer. Closer.

411
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,704
Rocksroy's on the ring.

412
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,372
-Can he get it off?
-Let's go!

413
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,375
He's got it hooked.
He's got it off.

414
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,843
Now it's in the sand.

415
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,079
Now he's got to drag it.
Here comes Hai.

416
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,884
-What is happening?
-PROBST: You can feel
the pressure

417
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,819
-now kick in.
-Yeah, you got this.
-Good job.

418
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,722
Taku had a huge lead,

419
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,459
which puts the pressure
on Marya to pay it off.

420
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,830
-You got this.
-PROBST: Rocksroy very patient,

421
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,399
but this is not
a good situation.

422
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,400
Keep dragging it!

423
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,035
PROBST: Stick doesn't have
much leverage.

424
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,804
-There you go! There you go!
-It will take a great touch.

425
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,506
-Yes!
-Rocksroy's inside the ring.

426
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,076
Can he hook it again?
This would be a great maneuver.

427
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,547
-And this might do it.
-(overlapping shouting)

428
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,216
PROBST: For the win for Ika.

429
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,085
-Yes!
-(cheering)
-Yeah, baby!

430
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:11,723
Ika wins first challenge.
Huge job by Rocksroy,

431
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,926
earning camp supplies
for his tribe.

432
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,128
You're the man!
You are the man!

433
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,365
Sorry, guys.

434
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,501
Are you okay?
You're bleeding a lot.

435
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,571
Ika, congratulations.

436
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,840
Out of the gate, first victory.

437
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,775
Waiting for you
back at camp will be

438
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,611
your meager supplies:
a pot, machete and a flint.

439
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,112
As for the two losing tribes,

440
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,215
you have to go
to your new beaches now

441
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,350
and once again try in a new way

442
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,886
to earn your camp supplies.

443
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,921
Ika, grab your stuff,
get in your boat.

444
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,756
-You're heading out this way.
Congratulations.
-(cheering)

445
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,758
Get started building shelter.

446
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,728
Taku, grab your stuff,
head out.

447
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,029
You're going straight out.

448

<i>MARYA:</i>
<i>I mean, I failed.</i>

449

Like, it's gonna be real.

454
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,577
All right, Vati,
before I send you out,

455
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,046
Daniel, clearly
your shoulder is hurting.

456
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,381
What happened?

457
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,917
I think I-I pulled
a Stephenie LaGrossa here,

458
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,052
and I think
it-it just popped out.

459
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,587
We're gonna bring medical in
before you head out.

460
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,089
-Yes. Yes.
-PROBST: So you can paddle.

All right,
so let's give a little space.

463
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,265
Just step back a little bit
so we can just talk with Daniel.

That feels so much better.
-Wow. I saw it.

00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,290
I'm Drea. I'm 34.

508
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,692
Born and raised in Texas,

509
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,560

-ROCKSROY: Oh, awesome.

521

Being in the National Guard,
I think it'll be a real asset,

522
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,754
because young women,
as we have seen,

523
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,557
get voted out early on<i> Survivor</i>
pretty frequently.

524
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,427
So I think just having
that initial impression of me,

525
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,829
<i>of like, "Okay, she's going</i>
<i>to do her work around camp,</i>

<i>on hard work and discipline.</i>

531
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,808
And some people were surprised
when the hippie nerd

532
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,476
joined the Army National Guard,

533
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,779
<i>but to me the military</i>
<i>really exemplifies those values.</i>

534
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,348
<i>Also, my education</i>
<i>was always a top priority.</i>

535
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,418
<i>Uh, not to flex, but I got into</i>
<i>every college I applied to.</i>

536
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,954
<i>And now I got into Harvard.</i>

537

538
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,258

what I'm about to do here.

-Swati, Swati, Swati.

-Swati.
-Is it Tori?

-Yes. How'd you know?
-No way.

543

<i>TORI: So, my social strategy</i>
<i>coming into the game</i>

544
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,002
is, I want to tell people

545
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,504
what I want them
to think about me.

546
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,841
<i>So I told them I work</i>
<i>as a caregiver-- which is a lie.</i>

547

<i>I actually work as a therapist.</i>

548
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,211
But using
what I know in therapy

549
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,012

550

the three young people?

551

I guess we are.

552

<i>So we quickly start</i>
<i>working on our shelter,</i>

553

831
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,341
Let's move your palm fronds
over this way, and then, Z,

832
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,109
if you can help me
pull out everything.

833
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,278
<i>It was like herding cats.</i>

834
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,913
And I'm not a cat herder.

835
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,915

00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,191
Put it on this side--
here, over here.

841
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,193
This is why I'm moving this
out of this way.

00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,420

<i>watching them grow,</i>
<i>watching them develop.</i>

<i>It's such a different mindset</i>

861
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,778
<i>to go from always being needed</i>

862
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,446
<i>for something with your kids.</i>

863
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,850
<i>And then when you're put</i>

<i>adults, which you don't need</i>
<i>to teach them all the time,</i>

<i>it is a reset with my brain.</i>

866
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,991
It's a complete different way
of dealing with things.

867
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,527

-Where did his stick go?
-Which one?

00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,935
A wide stick so that we can

00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,184

<i>HAI:</i>

894

-Yeah.
-Very good story

899
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,545
that has a little bit
of a twist to it,

900
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,713
a little bit of a turn to it,

901
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,581
-a little bit of strangeness.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:34,352
Okay, so I applied for<i> Survivor</i>
one time ten years ago.

903
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,187
When I first started watching.

904
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,589
-MARYANNE: Oh, my gosh.
-But here's the twist.

905
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,359
-You ready?
-Yeah.

906
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,328
-I applied as a girl. Yeah.
-LINDSAY: Get out.
-OMAR: Ooh.

907
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,697
-Wow.
-OMAR: Oh.

908
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,833
Yeah. So I don't want
to hide anything

909
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,601
from you guys
'cause that's my true self.

910
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,603
-LINDSAY: Right.
-MARYANNE: Mm-hmm.
-I'm a transgender guy.

911
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,739
I started transitioning about
eight and a half years ago.

912
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,408
-LINDSAY: Uh-huh.
-OMAR: Wow.
-I had not told my parents.

913
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,843
Scared to death
to tell the parents

914
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,479
because I already knew
how they felt about it.

915
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,181
<i>I was born</i>

916
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,684
a girl.
I didn't feel like a girl.

917
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:12,023
<i>And I struggled with it.</i>
<i>Made me a very angry, sad,</i>

918
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,191
depressed person.

919
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:17,895
<i>And when I told my parents,</i>
<i>it was not accepted,</i>

920
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,866
<i>and so, I had to live my life</i>
<i>away from my family, which was</i>

921
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,067
very difficult because
I was very, very, very close

922
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,935
to my mother.

923
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,805
<i>While I was transitioning, my</i>
<i>mother had gotten really sick,</i>

924
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,474
<i>and my father had invited me</i>
<i>to come see her.</i>

925
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,043
<i>I said, "Let's bring her home."</i>

926
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,210
And he said, "Well, we can't

927
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,211
'cause we have
to have full-time care."

928
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,313
And I said, "So I'll move here,

929
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,482
and we'll take care of her
full-time."

930
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,554
<i>My father and I were never</i>
<i>close at all,</i>

931
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,256
<i>and during that time,</i>
<i>because we had</i>

932
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,124
<i>to spend literally</i>
<i>every day together,</i>

933
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,660
<i>we started to get</i>
<i>to know each other, and then,</i>

934
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,829
next thing he was asking,
did I have anybody in my life.

935
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,498
I'm like,
"Well, I'm actually married."

936
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,167
And he's like,
"Well, I'd like to meet her."

937
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,601
<i>And I thought,</i>
<i>"Well, that would be great.</i>

938
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,236
<i>She's a nurse.</i>
<i>She could help."</i>

939
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,272
<i>And so my wife got</i>
<i>to meet my dad.</i>

940
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:03,741
And they ended up
becoming close.

941
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,176
My mother and I were
very, very close.

942
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,813
And she started getting worse
and worse and...

943
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,782
um, she-she passed away.

944
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,617
<i>My father would ask me,</i>

945
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,186
"Why did your mother get sick?"

946
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,421
And I said, "'Cause I think
this was the plan.

947
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,491
You and I got a relationship,
and Mom got to know who I was."

948
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,526
So I tell you guys this
because I want to be honest

949
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,161
about who I am.

950
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,796
Survivor<i> makes you take</i>

951
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,600
everything and peel it off
and be vulnerable and open.

952
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,203
<i>And for me, that's</i>
<i>a huge testament for someone</i>

953
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,939
<i>who's always hid,</i>
<i>like, who I was.</i>

954
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,507
My goal is to get
to the million dollars.

955
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,210
But if that doesn't happen,
the fact

956
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,680
that I tried it
is a huge testament

957
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:45,116
to someone
who hid their whole life.

958
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,817
So there's your fire talk.

959
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,185

00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,964
Dude, I wouldn't even know
you had a bad shoulder

994
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,365
-if-if...
-Good.

995
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,466
<i>DANIEL:</i>
<i>Like, a lot of people after</i>

996
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,802
I potentially lost the challenge
for the tribe

997
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,404
and, like,
dislocated my shoulder,

998
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,607
<i>would have totally used that</i>
<i>to destroy my game,</i>

999
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,175
<i>and they didn't.</i>

1000
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,010
It just means so much
to be here right now.

1001
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,013
Um...

1002
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:28,452
-It is a childhood
leukemia scar.
-Oh, my God, you're...

1003
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,254
-Yeah.
-Good for you, but you're good?

1004
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,356
-Yeah, I'm fully cured.
Fully cured.
-Good for you, man.

1005
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,757
-Good for you.
-Yeah, that's amazing.
-Yeah.

1006
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,626
-CHANELLE: Wow.
-Yeah.

1007
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:39,296
<i>DANIEL: At age 15,</i>
<i>I was diagnosed with leukemia.</i>

1008
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,532
<i>I went through, like,</i>
<i>three years of chemotherapy.</i>

1009
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,468
<i>And one of the things</i>
<i>that helped me through all this</i>

1010
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,804
<i>was watching</i> Survivor.

1011
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,073
<i>It was just a way</i>

1012
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,976
of enjoying something that
brought me to a different world.

1013
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,746
DANIEL:
It was rough, but

1014
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,215
it was the best type of cancer
you can get if you're a kid.

1015
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,783
It was the most treatable.

1016
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,754
<i>So the idea to now go</i>
<i>from a hospital bed</i>

1017
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,991
<i>where I could not support</i>
<i>myself and have the strength</i>

1018
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,494
<i>to, like, brush my teeth to,</i>
<i>like, being on an island about</i>

1019
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,229
to have the adventure
of a lifetime--

1020
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,565
it's, uh... it's surreal.
It's absolutely...

1021
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,768
Then how could I not say yes
to that-that opportunity?

1022
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,937
-Yeah, it means a lot
to be here.
-Yeah.

1023
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,939
-So, yeah, it's great.
-HAI: Awesome.

1024
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,841
But the number one reason
I am here

1025
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:27,077
<i>is because there is,</i>
<i>like, some kid out there</i>

1026
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,780
<i>in some hospital bed longing</i>

1027
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:33,284
<i>to have an adventure</i>
<i>of this sort or just, like,</i>

1028
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,453
leave the hospital,
and I am out here

1029
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,422
because I'm playing
for that kid.

1030
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,261
<i>ZACH:</i>
<i>Who wants water?</i>

1031
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,529
-No one else wants it? Okay.
-DREA: Thank you.

1032
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,934
You know, I weighed in
before I came here.

1033
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,370
-How much?
-I'm, like, literally 118.

1034
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,472
You're... you were more
than me. I was 112.

1035
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,207
Dude, but 118 is the highest

1036
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,509
-I've ever been.
-But how tall are you?

1037
00:42:58,575 --> 00:42:59,977
<i>ZACH:</i>
<i>I like Romeo.</i>

1038
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:03,213
We're both, you know, ripped.

1039
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,384
<i>But trying to make an ally</i>
<i>on</i> Survivor<i> is one of the most</i>

1040
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,954
awkward experiences
I've ever been in.

1041
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,355
-Yeah.
-The most I've been is 118.

1042
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,990
<i>ZACH:</i>
<i>It's like waiting to be kissed.</i>

1043
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,725
<i>You need to be willing</i>
<i>to make that move,</i>

1044
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,328
to lean in, but it's terrifying.

1045
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,563
And what if you lean in,
they don't lean back?

1046
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,534
<i>But the first convo</i>
<i>I have with Romeo,</i>

1047
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,768
he asks me...

1048
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,205
How are<i> you</i> feeling? I was about
to ask you, how are you feeling?

1049
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,640
<i>To me that's like,</i>

1050
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,309
"Ding, ding."
Like, those are the words.

1051
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,178
That's... Like, that's
the words you're waiting for

1052
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,879
as a<i> Survivor</i> player.

1053
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,983
I'm going to talk to you like
superfan to superfan, right?

1054
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,519
-Yeah.
-I feel good about this tribe,
and you're the person

1055
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,255
that, like, I just relate to
the most, and I feel...

1056
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,257
I, too. Even when I saw you, I
was like, "We're both, like..."

1057
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,159
That's what I said.
I literally...

1058
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,067
-Taro?
-I think she said she saw a...

1059
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,603
I don't even know what taro is.
Isn't that, like, cards?

1060
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,071
She saw... she saw, like,
a taro leaf.

1061
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,174
I think it's taro leaves,
which means it has a root.

1062
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,379
(distant thudding)

1063
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:09,713
I mean, look, there's, like,
literally one thing to do

1064
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,814
on<i> Survivor.</i>

1065
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,919
<i>TORI:</i>
<i>I know this game. I know</i>

1066
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,922
you do not go off on your own
for an extended period of time.

1067
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,025
<i>But, so, I'm like,</i>
<i>"This is good. People know</i>

1068
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,726
<i>I'm looking for taro."</i>

1069
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:26,263
<i>Little do they know, I did look</i>
<i>around for an immunity idol.</i>

1070
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,099
<i>Like, I'm on</i> Survivor.
<i>I'm here to play.</i>

1071
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,467
<i>But they're never</i>
<i>gonna know that.</i>

1072
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,071
She's first.

1073
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,781
<i>TORI:</i>
<i>Then I come back,</i>
<i>and something's off.</i>

1074
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,715
<i>Something feels weird.</i>

1075
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,283
<i>I feel myself being nervous.</i>

1076
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,586
<i>Almost, I feel guilty</i>
<i>as if I've done something wrong</i>

1077
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,722
because I went to go try
to find food for my tribe,

1078
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,991
but I wasn't able to do so.

1079
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,162
Uh, I just want to let you know
that Drea is, like...

1080
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,963
-like, bringing your name up.
-Oh, really?

1081
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,932
Yeah, and it's, like,
it's all about

1082
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,501
that, like, uh...
that idol thing.

1083
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,270
<i>TORI:</i>
<i>There's these rumors</i>
<i>already being spread.</i>

1084
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,338
<i>That, to me, is, like,</i>

1085
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:09,840
<i>you're seeing your hopes</i>
<i>and dreams dashed</i>

1086
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,142
<i>before your very eyes because</i>

1087
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,579
you, yourself, I...
I made a very stupid decision.

1088
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,182
<i>Am I going to work through this</i>

1089
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,651
<i>and turn this around somehow</i>
<i>in my favor?</i>

1090
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,586
<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to find a way to do so.</i>

1091

MARYANNE:
You guys, there's a boat.

1092

<i>We're just working</i>
<i>on the shelter.</i>

1094
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,039
<i>And then I hear a "Om"</i>
<i>in the distance.</i>

1095
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,674
<i>I'm like, "Oh, my goodness."</i>

1096
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,043

-JONATHAN: You know what?
Y'all...

1101
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,024

<i>"I want to get on this boat."</i>

1103
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,428
But every single

1104
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,230
that if you leave the tribe,

1105
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,731
<i>that puts you on the outs.</i>

1106
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,000
I've just been weaving
palm fronds.

1107
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:13,203

But to speak very candidly...

1268
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,441
-Please.
-...it's very hard

1270
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,578

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,315
Why did you not tell us?

1273
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,884
Why did you wait
until the last minute?

1274
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:15,752
'Cause I was trying
to just quit it completely,

1275
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,387
'cause I didn't need it anymore.

1276
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,289
'Cause, I mean, we're talking
to my wife. She's a nurse.

1277
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,458
And I said, "I'm on lithium."

1278
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,026
And she's like, "Well, you're
weaning yourself off of it.

1279
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,961
You'll probably be off of it."

1280
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,297
You're charting it out
and thinking,

1281
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,032
-"I think I can get myself
to where I'm off it."
-Yeah.

1282
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,034
"I don't need to bring it up
'cause I'll be fine."

1283
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,503
Right, I just thought...
And it's a stigmatism.

1284
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,438
I mean, I'm a human
to know the fear is,

1285
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:38,041
everyone hears the word
"lithium,"

1286
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,976
and they go way back in time
where they're like,

1287
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,112
"That was a huge drug
back in the day."

1288
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,880
That was a scary drug to be on.

1289
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,783
And the first thought is,
the transition.

1290
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,652
-Right.
-"Was it because
of your transition?" I'm like,

1291
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,487
"That had... that had nothing
to do with it."

1292
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:51,788
If that were the case,
I would have been on lithium

1293
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,290
20 years ago
because I was so unhappy,

1294
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:55,525
-but that wasn't the case.
-Right.

1295
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,827
I took it for another reason.

1296
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,562
And this goes back a few years.

1297
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:03,199
For... When I started
taking care my mom in 2016,

1298
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,135
the stress of it...
I wasn't sleeping.

1299
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,836
Like, two hours a night.

1300
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,338
And they're like, "Well,
you have to start sleeping."

1301
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,006
So that was a way
for me to take something

1302
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,409
that I could
actually sleep with.

1303
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,877
-Which is not uncommon.
-It wasn't.

1304
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,346

that I was on something because

1305
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,547
I don't know
how anybody could go through...

1306
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,249

00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,899
talking about it.
Is that from the same place of,

1313
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,735
"If-if I'm just honest and open,
and if we would just talk more,

1314
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,705
we could... we could get rid
of some of these stigmas?"

1315
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:43,740
By far. I think you should
talk about everything.

1316
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,875
I'm not ashamed to say

1317
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,178
I need help with certain things,
and that's life.

1318
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,680
-I mean...
-Okay, so just to be clear,

1319
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:54,751
the only problem
with this medication is,

1320
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,854
it does have a reaction when
you are stressed, not eating,

1321
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,923
-dehydrated, not sleeping...
-Right.

1322
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,458
...physically demanding
challenges.

1323
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,927
And that's where
our concern came.

1324
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,863
The cumulative effect
of this show would-would have

1325
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:10,200
a potentially very bad impact
on you, and we don't want that.

1326
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:13,236
Your safety is paramount.

1327
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,439
We can't do it.
We can't.

1328
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,910
Yeah, so...

1329
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:25,448
I get it, and I appreciate you
talking to me about it.

1330
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,318
It's weird that I'm getting
emotional about it, but even

1331
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,320
to test yourself for 48 hours,

1332
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,722
-it is such an adventure.
-Huh.

1333
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,760
And I take this with love,
and...

1334
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,595
I know that I'll be friends
with these people.

1335

the opportunity.

anything about them

1337
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:48,238
for 40 years,
then to have someone say,

1338

"People like the things
about you that you didn't know

1339
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,076

speaks volumes.

when it comes to that,

it's dehydration,
a lot of things

Jonathan is now realigning Taku,

1483
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,185
giving them a head start.

1484
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:11,754

PROBST:
Rocksroy drops
his chest in the water.

1486
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,194
They're gonna have to now
get it up in their boat,

1487
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:22,298
which makes that leverage
so much more difficult.

1488
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:25,868
-Everybody working now
to get that blue chest in there.
-(grunting loudly)

1489
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,504
They've got it.
Ika's heading out.

1490

Vati has pulled themselves
back into the challenge,

1491
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:32,675
if they can get it in there.

1492
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,311
Jonathan's got to be
on that boat, too, and he is.

1493
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,948
You got to get to the sand

1494
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,717
-OMAR: Yes.
-PROBST: Ika working on

You're good!

1497
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,354

Once again.

Ika struggling now to get
that third chest in there.

1501
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,297
It is heavy and there's
not a lot of room.

1502
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:59,235
Now you are dragging a very
heavy boat through the sand...

1503
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,871
-MIKE: Go.
-JENNY: All right, we're good.
-PROBST: ...with three chests.

1504
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:05,641

challenge, but you're doing it.

1505
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,376

...look to be opting to take

1510
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,520
the chests out
and walk them up the beach.

1511
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,755
They are so heavy.

1512
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,691
PROBST:
It's taking everything. Now you
still got to get the boat up.

1513
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,025
(straining)

1514
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,261
That sand has
a lot of resistance.

1515
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,831
-(grunting)
-PROBST: You are earning it,
every single grunt.

1516

(straining)

1517
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:35,871

PROBST:
Slow and steady.

01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,778
Here comes Vati.

1522

-They're making progress.
-One, two, three.

1523
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:47,016
Now you got to get the chest
back on the boat,

1524
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,285
-'cause everything's got to
go together through the net.
-Yeah.

1525
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,286
-(grunts)
-Take a breath,

1526
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:51,354
take a breath, take a breath.

1527
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,023

1534
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,571
This is not easy either.

PROBST:
You don't need to win,
you just don't want to be last.

1640

Please, guys,
let's go, let's go!

1641
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,633
-PROBST: There goes Jenny
with a piece and another piece.
-CHANELLE: Yes, Jenny!

1642
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,169
-Omar looking to close it out
for Taku.
-LINDSAY: Nice. Great job.

1643
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,571
Swati, this one
should go there.

1644
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,742
This one.

1645
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,544
Ika now hitting
their own roadblock.

1646
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:10,212
That one, that one, that one.

1647
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:13,716
Omar and Maryanne can smell
victory. Is this the last piece?

1648
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,255
-MARYANNE: Jeff, do we have it?
-OMAR: We got it.
-Taku...

1649
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,524
-has it! Taku wins immunity!

1652
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:30,032
Big celebration. We're still
looking for one more.

1653
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,268
Jenny down to three pieces left.

1654
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,669
Don't knock it down.
Be careful.

1655
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,170
Come on! Theirs could fall out!

1656
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,539
PROBST:
You can put this one
in the Deepfreeze.

1657
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:38,340
Ika is in trouble.

1658
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:41,010
-Vati one piece away.
-DREA: Don't hit it out.

1659
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,745
-PROBST: Jenny has it.
Got to get it in.
-HAI: Careful on that last one.

1660
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:44,747
JENNY:
Okay.

1661
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:47,683
-And there it is.
Vati wins immunity!
-(cheering)

1662
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,218
They are safe
from Tribal Council,

1663
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,554
sending Ika

1664
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,024
to the first Tribal Council
of<i> Survivor 42.</i>

1665
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,265
That is one of the most
grueling challenges.

1666
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:05,834
There is no doubt you earned it.

1667
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:10,139
-Result is, Taku, immunity.
-(applauding)

1668
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:13,475
Lost one person.
You're not losing anybody else.

1669
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,644
Everyone touch it.
Everyone touch it.

1670
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,080
Vati, nobody going home
from your tribe.

1671
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,081
Jenny, go get it.

1672
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,482
Well earned, Jenny. Nice job.

1673
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,151
-Thank you, Jeff.
-Jenny on the block.

1674
01:10:22,217 --> 01:10:23,452
-(chuckles)
-PROBST: All right, Vati,

1675
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,821
Taku, head back to camp.
No Tribal Council.

1676
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,556
Nobody going home.
Enjoy the night off.

1677
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,425
Yeah.

1678
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,961
PROBST:
All right, Ika.
Tribal Council tonight.

1679
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:34,630
There's also
the punishment of losing.

1680
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,165
-DREA: Mm-hmm.
-TORI: Yeah.
-Got to give me your flint.

1681
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:38,334
-It's okay.
-Thanks, Romeo.

1682
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:40,836
Sorry for you.

1683
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,504
-Are you?
-We'll get that back.

1684
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,939
You'll have a chance
to earn it back

1685
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,274
at the next immunity challenge.

1686
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,643
All right, Ika,
see you tonight where somebody

1687
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,746
will be the second person
to leave<i> Survivor 42.</i>

1688
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,015
<i>ZACH: I know that the puzzles</i>

1694
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,496

-For what?
-For the puzzle.

1699
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,011
For the puzzle.

1700
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,046
There are no excuses.

1701
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,081
We win is a team,

1702

-That's how I look at it.
-DREA: Mm-hmm.

1703

I-I just appreciate you so much,

1704
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:35,090
And I just want to thank you all
for that.

1705
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:36,925
Can I say something first,
before we all do split up?

1706
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,427
-ROCKSROY: Yeah.
-Just because,

1707
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:39,428
whether we like it or not,

1708
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,896
we do have to make
a big decision tonight.

1709
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:41,930
And I know that

1710
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,433
talk of idols will play
into that decision.

1711
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,502
So I just want to talk
to you guys

1712
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:49,805
as all rational,
logical, intelligent people.

1713
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:52,074
I know there's been a rumor
that I have an idol.

1714
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,009
So, like, I don't want that
to have to

1715
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:55,010
factor into our decision, okay?

1716
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:56,779
Like, I don't have it,

1717
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,881
so that doesn't need to be
something we, like, work around.

1718
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,418
<i>I have to really quickly dispel</i>

1719
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,353
that paranoia behind me
having an idol,

1720
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,089
because if that's
what takes me out,

1721
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,657
that's honestly stupid.

1722
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,025
But I did want to talk to you
one-on-one,

1723
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,527
just, like, woman-to-woman,
'cause I did hear

1724
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:13,529
that the idol rumor
came from you, so...

1725
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,197
Other people
were also getting in my head

1726
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,498
that you were out
there looking for it.

1727
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,000
But then... Oh.

1728
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:22,838
Can someone fess up

1729
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:26,675
and tell us who told her that?

1730
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,711
Just to clear the air,

1731
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,345
'cause now we're all
gonna have paranoia.

1732
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:33,115
<i>ZACH:</i>
<i>It really was me.</i>

1733
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,017
<i>Like, I was the one</i>
<i>who ran down to tell her.</i>

1734
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,819
<i>All I'm thinking to myself is,</i>

1735
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,855
"Oh, Tori's throwing me
under the bus. Cool."

1736
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:43,125
<i>Uh, so I know that I'm gonna be</i>
<i>in trouble tonight.</i>

1737
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,993
There was never a rumor
that you had an idol.

1738
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,462
-Okay, yay.
-There's only a rumor
that you were looking for it.

1739
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,363
-Okay, yeah.
-And that's when...

1740
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,998
-Just to talk
about the challenge...
-Mm-hmm.

1741
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,800
At one point,

1742
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,837
I was looking
at both Zach and Rocks.

1743
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:58,507
It was only me
pulling at the front.

1744
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:01,043
-Rocks kept on saying "stop"
because he was tired.
-Mm-hmm.

1745
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,745
I was literally in the water

1746
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:05,714
having to pull it,
like, push it up.

1747
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,516
-Yeah, you were
freaking killing it.
-And I just feel like

1748
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,719
-he's not contributing at all.
-Mm-hmm.

1749
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,588
Thank you, Rocks, for helping
build our shelter and fire,

1750
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,256
and now we can take it
from here.

1751
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,024
-I did the fire.
-Yeah, true, you did.

1752
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,593
You made the fire. Yeah.

1753
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,329
<i>Drea comes up with this idea</i>
<i>of getting out Rocks.</i>

1754
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:22,898
<i>It's a really good idea because</i>
<i>he helped us with the shelter.</i>

1755
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,233
We don't need him anymore.

1756
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:25,334
Let's get Rocks out.

1757
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,869
Yes. Rocks is out.

1758
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:27,736
Yeah.

1759
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:33,542
-You need to wash those off.
-What?

1760
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,110
Those things
that you call shoes.

1762
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:41,283
Anything that is not me tonight,

1763
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,752
'cause I know that, like,
Zach and I did the puzzle,

1764
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:46,121
so Zach and I have a little bit
more of a target on our backs.

1765
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,157
I want to know
who would you want to.

1766
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:53,061
I would still feel...
better getting Zach out.

1767
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:54,196

-Okay.

01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,370
<i>'Cause yesterday I took the risk</i>
<i>to lose my vote,</i>

1802
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,672
and I will only know
in Tribal, when I go to vote,

1803
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,208
if I have my vote
or if I've lost my vote.

1804
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,544
<i>So, I will vote Tori</i>
<i>if that's where it's going.</i>

1805
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:21,950
I think, you know,
we all... we all know

1806
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:23,652
what's going on here, so..

1807
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:25,387
-Yeah...
-Um, I think... I think

1808
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:28,991
it could be either one of us,
but... I don't know.

<i>Either everyone's voting</i>
<i>for Tori,</i>

1812
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,633
<i>or people are voting for me.</i>

1813
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,668
I just wanted to say,
like, whatever happens,

1814
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:41,837
-no hard feelings.
-Yeah. Okay.

1815

That's what we say
to begin Tribal Council,

1846

only to remind you

1847
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,422
that that flame is literally
your life in the game,

1848
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,823
and there are six flames.

1849
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,291
Shortly,
there will only be five.

1850
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,428
So, Rocksroy, it's one thing
to watch the show.

1851
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,063
It's another to go camping.

1852
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:51,133
But to get out here and
actually be physically living

1853
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,135
in a real jungle--
what's it been like?

1854
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:55,070
It's been... it's been tough.

1855
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,638
And when you told us
that we will not

1856
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:57,939
be receiving any rice--

1857
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,843
I think all of us,
collectively, was like, "What?!"

1858
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:03,512
And from watching a lot
of<i> Survivor</i>

1859
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:05,147
and then survival shows,

1860
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:09,718
I could 100% say,
"America, this show is real."

1861
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,521
Zach, how about for you?
I know you've dreamed

1862
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:14,256
of being on<i> Survivor,</i>
and now here you are.

1863
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:15,724
You're living out in the jungle.

1864
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,893
The first thing
I'm thinking of is, you know,

1865
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:20,028
watching the show, when
the shelter's getting built,

1866
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,897
you get-- what-- like,
a minute-30 long montage?

1867
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,698
(Drea laughs)

1868
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:25,300
ZACH:
So I'm sitting there
waiting, like,

1869
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,436
"When does the montage start?
When are we going

1870
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,271
to get through this stuff?"
But instead

1871
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:32,207
I was able to really go to work
on the shelter, and I feel like

1872
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:35,444
every single person here pulled
their weight and made it happen.

1873
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,946
PROBST:
So, Drea,

1874
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:40,048
we're in the early stage
of the game.

1875
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,417
And of course, you want to build
your own individual game,

1876
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,920
which is making alliances
and relationships.

1877
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,289
But you do have to have
a strong tribe,

1878
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:49,558
because if you don't have
a strong tribe,

1879
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,560
you end up at Tribal Council
where there's nowhere to hide.

1880
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:55,564
I truly believe that this is
going to be a very hard season.

1881
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,899
We're continuously improving
the camp

1882
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:00,302
while trying to find food.

1883
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:01,736
-Right.
-And then you're like,

1884
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:04,506
"Oh, and we lost
the challenge today.

1885
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,675
We have to get someone out."
So, for me,

1886
01:19:06,741 --> 01:19:08,343
I do think you need
to have a strong tribe.

1887
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,646
So, did Shot in the Dark
come up, Romeo?

1888
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:15,417
I mean, I think every individual
here looks at it differently.

1889
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:18,820
If you feel desperate
tonight, use it.

1890
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,256
If you don't, don't use it.
It's early in the game.

1891
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,625
I think it's an individual
decision, but nobody said

1892
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,293
if they were using it or not.

1893
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,962
-Swati, you nervous?
-SWATI: Yes.

1894
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,430
If I could cut off a finger

1895
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,865
to not be
at Tribal tonight, I would.

1896
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,500
I just, like,
don't want to be here.

1897
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:33,935
-You would give up
your pinkie...
-SWATI: Yeah.

1898
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,704
...for the rest of your life

1899
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:38,206
-to survive one Tribal?
-Yes. Yes. (laughs)
-ROMEO: Oh.

1900
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,508
And if you came back
next Tribal,

1901
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:40,842
and I said, "The other pinkie"?

1902
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:42,444
-(gasps) Ooh.
-Oh.

1903
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:45,947
I think past, like,
day seven or eight,

1904
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:47,282
I would stop giving up
a finger.

1905
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:48,683
PROBST:
All right, so, two digits?

1906
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,652
You know, it's not that weird.
I mean...

1907
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,120
(laughter)

1908
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,389
Zach, how about for you?

1909
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,058
I definitely feel
very nervous tonight.

1910
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,061
I know that my name has been
thrown out there, so

1911
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:04,533
I-I would be really surprised
if it wasn't me and Tori.

1912
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:07,169
-One of us.
-PROBST: Tori, you're nodding.

1913
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,370
-You agree with that?
-TORI: I know

1914
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,804
that I'm on the chopping block,

1915
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,239
which is literally terrifying.

1916
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:13,875
I wanted to throw up
when I just said that, but

1917
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,076
I believe
that I am a strong player,

1918
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:17,012
and so, if you keep me in this,

1919
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:18,146
you're going to keep us strong,

1920
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,315
and the people I've been
working with in an alliance

1921
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:21,583
are going to keep me around.

1922
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,618
And I am a trustworthy,
loyal person.

1923
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:25,320
I haven't been able
to prove that to you yet,

1924
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,556
-but I will be able to tonight.
-ZACH: Well, I...

1925
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,358
I don't know. The trustworthy
and loyal is just the...

1926
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,460
that part that I get
caught up on, you know.

1927
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,462
'Cause obviously we've had
a little bit of differences

1928
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:35,864
when it comes to, like,

1929
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,567
where we started the game
and where we are now.

1930
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:41,570
And I mean, I still...
I still really like Tori.

1931
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:43,505
-Um...
-Doesn't want to work
with me anymore, though.

1932
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,140
I do not want
to work with her...

1933
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,441
PROBST:
Well, and her body language
just shifted

1934
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:50,078
very clearly when you started
leaning in. She's closed off.

1935
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:53,081
I know that Tori went
to Drea and, like,

1936
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,617
you know, tried
to throw me under the bus,

1937
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,752
and that's kind of
how the whole day started.

1938
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,721
TORI:
Wow. That's crazy. I'm, like,

1939
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,691
so mentally,
I guess, fatigued that

1940
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,226
I don't remember that happening.

1941
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,728
-Now, are you being sarcastic?
-Absolutely, yes.

1942
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:08,029
-PROBST: You're saying
that did not happen?
-TORI: Yeah.

1943
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,631
It didn't happen.
Just to go to all of this,

1944
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,434
the only reason I'm even
being mentioned now is because

1945
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,004
I was foraging for food
for literally ten minutes

1946
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:18,373
by myself, which is a mistake.

1947
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,475
And then I come back,
and, you know, of course

1948
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,910
there's going to be a talk
because in this game,

1949
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,712
when you have not solidified
trust or alliances,

1950
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:27,582
you are looking for any
single thing that you can find

1951
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,718
to pit someone against another,

1952
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:31,987
or to say "Ooh,
maybe we shouldn't trust them."

1953
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,221
And I got caught
in the crossfire,

1954
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:34,422
and that's why I'm here.

1955
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:36,558
That is why
my name got brought up.
