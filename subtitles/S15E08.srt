2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,005
on<i> Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,340
James found the second hidden

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,925
immunity idol at Zhan Hu.

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,093
>> I have it now.

6
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,636
I have it in my possession.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,975
I'm on<i> Survivor</i> with two idols.

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,268
>> JEFF: Erik found the plaque

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,561
James discarded, and Jaime

10
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,520
suspected it might be an

11
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,688
immunity idol.

12
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,897
>> If I play the hidden immunity

13
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,815
idol tonight, it's probably

14
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,024
going to shock everyone.

15
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:25,608
I'm not as dumb as I look, and

16
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,527
maybe they're figuring it out.

17
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,987
>> JEFF: The next day, the two

18
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,238
tribes merged...

19
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,072
Drop your buffs.

20
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,282
You are merged.

21
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,743
...and enjoyed a celebration

22
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,786
feast.

23
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,871
>> Sweet and sour pork, you

24
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,913
guys.

25
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,789
>> Beef.

26
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,623
>> Beef.

27
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,208
>> Whoa!

28
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,793
Easy!

29
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,837
>> Jeff's here!

30
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,005
>> JEFF: What up?

31
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,423
In an unexpected challenge...

32
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,090
You will be tested on your

33
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,134
recollection of events that

34
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,552
happened during the feast and

35
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,303
the celebration.

36
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,014
Frosti was the first to win

37
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,307
individual immunity.

38
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,684
The former Zhan Hu were

39
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,977
outnumbered by the former Fei

40
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,186
Long.

41
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,145
>> Now all we have to do is put

42
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,564
the nails in the coffin and bury

43
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,107
them.

44
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,108
>> JEFF: Convinced they had a

45
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:07,650
hidden idol, Jaime and Erik

46
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,527
planned to use it to get rid of

47
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,738
Jean-Robert.

48
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,038
>> JEFF: At tribal council,

49
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:20,580
I-/////!ll read the votes.

50
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,500
Jaime played the idol while a

51
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,251
shocked Jean-Robert looked on.

52
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,588
The rules of<i> Survivor</i> state if

53
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,965
the immunity idol is played, any

54
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,634
votes cast against that person

55
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,552
will not count, and the person

56
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,178
with the next highest number of

57
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,014
votes will be sent home.

58
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,265
This, however, is not a hidden

59
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,518
immunity idol.

60
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,852
>> Oh, my gosh!

61
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,145
>> JEFF: Jaime, Erik, and Peih-

62
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,897
Gee voted for Jean-Robert.

63
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,732
But the former members of Fei

64
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,901
Long stuck together, and Jaime

65
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,069
became the first member of the

66
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,487
jury.

67
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,822
Nine are left.

68
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,907
Who will be voted out tonight?

69
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,462
>> I know.

70
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,213
I was, like, terrified.

71
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:10,713
I was like, "Oh, my gosh."

72
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,006
>> I mean, I knew 100% I'm going

73
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,007
home.

74
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,050
At tribal council, I had a close

75
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,177
call.

76
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,554
Jaime pulled this little plaque

77
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,638
out of her bag.

78
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,389
I mean, I was like, "Is this

79
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,891
really happening?

80
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,309
Could this possibly be that she

81
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,395
found an individual immunity

82
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,522
idol somewhere in our camp?"

83
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,357
>> Before you get in bed, Erik

84
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,233
has to go back there.

85
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,359
>> Well, just move over!

86
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:36,948
Move over.

87
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,116
What the hell?

88
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,075
Well, goodness gracious, sakes

89
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,203
alive.

90
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,538
>> You wouldn't want to move.

91
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,832
So shut up, James.

92
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,675
(<i> laughter</i> )

93
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,759
>> Jean Robert don't know that I

94
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,969
have both immunity idols.

95
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,095
We can't tell him that, because

96
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,680
it's Jean-Robert.

97
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,848
He's going to mess something up.

98
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,849
We just need to keep his dumb

99
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,683
ass in line just because we're

100
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,642
stuck with him now.

101
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,810
We need his vote, so we have to

102
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,979
deal with it.

tribemates, and we have to stick

109
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,765
together.

110
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,100
We put ourselves in a position

111
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,476
by all these personalities

112
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,144
coming together.

113
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,354
We're complete opposites.

114
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,022
I mean we've got a lunch lady,

115
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:33,648
we have a professional gambler,

116
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,858
we have a stewardess,

117
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,235
We have a waitress from New

118
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,194
York.

119
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,112
There's a gravedigger.

120
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,029
All our personalities, even

121
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,530
though we clash, we pull

122
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,032
together, and we've won

123
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,242
together, you know?

124
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:44,867
And the other team, that's not

125
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,451
how they work.

126
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,494
The other team, they got

127
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,370
together as a clique.

128
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,247
They're not trying to win a

129
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,998
million dollars.

130
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,790
They were trying to win the high

131
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,542
school friend contest.

132
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,591
I just got two of them, because

133
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,926
they're catching too fast.

134
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,468
>> Oh, my god!

135
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,553
>> Oh, my god!

136
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,346
>> Wow!

137
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,223
>> That is beautiful!

138
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,267
At this moment, James is in a

139
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,892
very good position, because he

140
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,603
has both immunity idols for

141
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,605
sure, so he's almost guaranteed

142
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,065
himself in a top five position

143
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,401
right now.

144
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,571
He's a strong physical, mental

145
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,530
player of this game.

146
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,573
So I am kind of afraid that he

147
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,826
could win the whole thing.

148
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,334
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

149
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,092
So you guys ready to get to your

150
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,343
reward challenge?

151
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,344
>> Yeah.

152
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:45,595
>> Yeah.

153
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,471
>> JEFF: For today's challenge,

154
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,430
you will be divided into two

155
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,474
teams of four.

156
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,726
One member from each team will

157
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,144
sit in their boat while the

158
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:53,770
opposing team will use buckets

159
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,355
of water to try and sink them.

160
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,024
The person in the boat will have

161
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,358
to bail the water out as fast as

162
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,610
possible to stay afloat.

163
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,528
The first team to sink the other

164
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,322
team's boat two times wins

165
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,615
reward.

166
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,491
Want to know what you're playing

167
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:06,657
for?

168
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,450
>> Yes.

169
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,451
>> Yeah, please.

170
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,369
>> JEFF: The winning team of

171
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,746
four will leave here and be

172
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,039
taken to an ancient village.

173
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:13,623
People have lived here for the

174
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,750
past 1,000 years.

175
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,251
It's a beautiful place where

176
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,128
you'll enjoy an authentic

177
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:19,504
Chinese meal.

178
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,546
>> Oh!

179
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,506
>> JEFF: It's a break from camp

180
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,423
and a chance to put something

181
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,424
good in your belly.

182
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,592
>> Hell, yeah.

183
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,635
>> JEFF: In addition, the

184
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,678
winning team of four will take

185
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,846
this with them to open on the

186
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,264
reward.

187
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,390
Worth playing for?

188
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,350
>> Yes!

189
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,309
>> JEFF: All right, we're going

190
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,268
to randomly choose captains.

191
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:34,811
We'll do a schoolyard pick.

192
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,147
Peih-Gee, you're the captain of

193
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:38,481

Jean-Robert, you're the captain

195
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,609
of the Yellow Team.

196
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,568
You won the right to choose

197
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,694
first.

198
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,071
Who do you want?

199
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:45,988
>> Hang on, let me think about

200
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,864
this first.

201
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,990

212
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,131
who do you want?

213
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,257
>> I guess I'll go with Erik.

214
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,341

Erik, you have one choice to

222
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,854
make-- it is between Denise and

223
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,479
Courtney.

224
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,731
Who will be the final person

225
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,443
participating in this challenge?

226
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,029
>> We're going to go with

227
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,614
Courtney because she's light.

228
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,824
>> JEFF: Courtney.

229
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,950
>> Sorry, Denise.

230
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:31,492

231
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,494
>> JEFF: Take a spot along with

232
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,037

You'll not be eligible for the

237

00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,969
We'll get started.

243
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,847
All right, this challenge plays

244
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,098
best two out of three.

245
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,308
Each round you'll put somebody

246
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,809

247
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,768
For the first round, who's going

248
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,519

249
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,896

>> Come on, Courtney.

258
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,746
Come here, Courtney.

259
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,039
>> ...while the person in the

260
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:18,581
boat paddles away, trying to

261
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,540
avoid you.

262
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,750

263
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,543

James, and Jean-Robert.

268
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,550
>> I hate all of you!

269
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,593
>> JEFF: She's baling as fast as

270
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,802

Todd getting drenched by Frosti,

272
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,097

>> Oh, Jeff, shut up!

278
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,606
>> Get in the middle, Courtney,

279
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,982

280
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,400

his boat a hard target, and

284
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,572

292
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,544
water.

293
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,087
Very close to going under.

294
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,089
Todd has hardly any water at all

295
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,132

>> JEFF: Uh-oh.

300
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,848
That will do it.

302
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,686

Will the red team have better

315
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,297
luck this round?

316
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,922

Amanda's got a nice, safe spot

325
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,693
in the middle, making herself a

326
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,861
hard target.

327
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,738
Peih-Gee, Courtney look tired

328
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,239

James not tired at all.

330
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,452

Frosti in trouble now.

332
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,913
He's cornered.

333
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,831

335
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,753

Courtney, Erik, and Denise, got

341
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,603
nothing for you.

342
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,520
Get in the boat and head back to

343
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,813
camp.

344
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,237
James, Todd, Amanda, Jean-

345
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,530

346
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,490
here.

347
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,407
You'll be taken to an ancient

348
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,367
village.

349
00:10:59,450 --> 00:10:59,867
You'll have a nice meal.

350
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,328
While you're there, open this,

351
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:02,870
read it together.

352
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,705
It is for all four of you.

353
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,415
Jean-Robert, catch.

354
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,750
Have a good time.

355
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,252
>> Thank you.

356
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,409
>> This is amazing.

357
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,577
>> How cool, eh?

358
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,787
>> The reward was nice.

359
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,414
We had the opportunity to go and

360
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,915
see a thousand-year-old village.

361
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,167
Now, I mean, I'm not really one

362
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,211
to enjoy the romantic side of

363
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,171
stuff, but when you walk in the

364
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:54,880
place, the construction of

365
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,258
everything, and you could feel,

366
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,592
like, the history, that was

367
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,927
really nice.

368
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,097
>> Guys, where are we?

369
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,306
Like, oh, my god, this is

370
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,474
unbelievable.

371
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,768
>> This is authentic Chinese

372
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,520
dining.

373
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,813
This is the real deal.

374
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:15,734
Wow.

375
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,698
>> Idol clue.

376
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,657
There is a hidden immunity idol.

377
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,658
Wow.

378
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:22,950
>> Really?

379
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,119
>> All right, here we go.

380
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,912
"This is the final clue to the

381
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,372
whereabouts of hidden immunity."

382
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,957
I've got to tell you, when I

383
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,834
read this, I was, like, a little

384
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,169
bit surprised.

385
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:33,919
As much information as there has

386
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,838
been out there, I should have

387
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,922
known something.

388
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:37,965
I should have had some sort of

389
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:38,841
clue.

390
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:39,842
I mean, that shook me up a

391
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,885
little bit.

392
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,969
"Hidden immunity idol clue

393
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,097
number one-- what is thought to

394
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,558
be hidden may sometimes be seen.

395
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,767
>> When Jean-Robert busted open

396
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,310
those clues for the hidden

397
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,811
immunity idol, it was kind of

398
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,021
funny, because there's no idol

399
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,731
out there.

400
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,899
It's already been found.

401
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,650
James has both immunity idols,

402
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,818
and Jean-Robert is the only one

403
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,153
from Fei Long who doesn't know

404
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,738
about it.

405
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,031
>> This is big, guys.

406
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:02,990
I mean, winning today's

407
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:03,908
challenge...

408
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,867
>> Exactly.

409
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,409
>> Bigger than dinner and

410
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:05,993
culture.

411
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,245
>> Oh, my gosh!

412
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,457
>> Oh!

413
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,459
>> Mmm!

414
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,543
>> Wonderful, yes!

415
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,586
>> Oh, there's more coming,

416
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,712
still.

417
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,671
>> Yeah!

418
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,589
>> Wow, wontons are great.

419
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,465
>> Yeah.

420
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,216
>> James, you think they know

421
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,217
how to make wontons here?

422
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,676
>> I do believe.

423
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,677
This place has been here a

424
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,553
thousand years.

425
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,346
I think they might have made a

426
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,180
wonton or two.

427
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:26,847
What you think?

428
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,100
Hand me them peanuts.

429
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,311
>> This is the best day ever.

430
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,483
>> Everybody made the perfect

431
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,609
picks.

432
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,277
>> So, what do you do with that

433
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:40,986
afterwards?

434
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,030
Where do you store it?

435
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,114
What do you do?

436
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,115
You had it before.

437
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,283
What did you do with it?

438
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,451
>> It disappeared.

439
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,661
>> Oh, it disappears.

440
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,745
>> Yeah.

441
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,748
>> I'm not bringing that back.

442
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,083
Are you bringing it back?

443
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,209
>> Hell, no.

444
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,585
>> Well, you better jog your

445
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,878
memory, homey.

446
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,921
>> I did not know there was an

447
00:13:59,004 --> 00:13:59,964
American immunity idol.

448
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,715
>> American immunity idol.

449
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,425
Cool.

450
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,635
That's great.

451
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,803
There's an American immunity

452
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,179
idol.

453
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,264
>> We could really have some fun

454
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,640
with this, you guys.

455
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,017
Jean-Robert has no idea.

456
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,394
I think that was the best part

457
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,979
of the whole evening was hearing

458
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,313
him talk about finding this

459
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,273
idol-- "What do you guys think

460
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,107
it can be?

461
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,149
I don't know where it is."

462
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,401
>> Guys, I've been drinking wine

463
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,735
all right?

464
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,822
American immunity idol.

465
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,223
>> I'm very upset right now.

466
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,182
You know, what am I going to do,

467
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,183
though?

468
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,226
I mean, there was a pick today

469
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,227
at the challenge.

470
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,645
I mean, I was standing there,

471
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,063
you know, looking at everybody,

472
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,648
and just sitting on the bench.

473
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,316
And, you know, I'm big, I'm fat,

474
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,568
I'm always the last one picked.

475
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,944
I mean, it's been like that my

476
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,987
whole life.

477
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,573
And here it is again.

478
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,327
You know, I mean, you're the

479
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,077
last one standing there.

480
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,120
Are they going to do that when

481
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,163
it comes down to the final

482
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:14,997
seven?

483
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,166
Am I going to be the one that's

484
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,250
going to go home before J.R?

485
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,251
Am I going to be one that goes

486
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,336
home before James?

487
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,462
I don't want to be that person.

488
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,463
You know, I want to stay in this

489
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,923
game as long as I possibly can.

490
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,390
>> I guess, you know, James is

491
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,933
probably a bigger threat.

492
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,477
>> No, J.R. is a major threat.

493
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,144
>> I want J.R.

494
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,647
I think he's kind of more of the

495
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,815
full threat package.

496
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,525
>> There's five of us here.

497
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,193
I'm, like, "Wait a minute."

498
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,070
I was like, "If we all band

499
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,197
together, it will be four to

500
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,073
five, and guess what?"

501
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,909
Jean-Robert and James, oh,

502
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,951
Amanda, okay, bye.

503
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,577
I kind of have nothing to lose.

504
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,203
Like, I'll try anything at this

505
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,580
point.

506
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,790
You know, if J.R. goes out

507
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,291
before I do, if either you or

508
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,459
Courtney are on final two, I'll

509
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,127
give either one of you my vote.

510
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,505
Because I would love to see him

511
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,007
taken out before me.

512
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:09,551
>> Peih-Gee is trying to shake

513
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,095
things up and get us to vote out

514
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,346
Jean-Robert.

515
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,430
Nobody likes him, so it's kind

516
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,056
of an easy vote.

517
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,141
If I decide to go with Peih-Gee

518
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,936
and Erik, I could end up in a

519
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,396
good situation with them, but I

520
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,897
don't want to go against the

521
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,232
rest of the tribe and have them

522
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,483
vote against me.

523
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,234
So I'm thinking it over and

524
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,319
deciding what I'm going to do.

525
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,113
If I think the best way for me

526
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,656
is to go with you guys, then I'm

527
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,740
going to go with you guys.

528
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,324
If I think the best way for me

529
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,033
is to go with them, then I'm

530
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,910
going to go with them.

531
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:35,703
I'm going to tell you that

532
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,745
honestly,

533
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,163
Straight up.

534
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,265
>> I didn't even sleep last

535
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,433
night, I was so anxious to get

536
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,350
that immunity idol.

537
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,185
I mean, that's the difference in

538
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:41,477
the game.

539
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,020
That could protect me.

540
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:43,854
That could be my million

541
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,106
dollars right there.

542
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,945
I looked around, and I remember

543
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:52,571
some clue about four bats, and I

544
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,406
know it's above, and I got the

545
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,241
feeling that it was someplace

546
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,242
where we walk every time we come

547
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,369
home.

548
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,412
So I decided it was probably

549
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,664
one of those mini pagodas.

550
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,091
Now I'm thinking it might be one

551
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,218
of these plaques.

552
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,135
The four bats thing makes sense,

553
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,345
one of the plaques.

554
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,722
So right now I think I'm going

555
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,098
to try to take the other three

556
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,099
down, and I can figure out which

557
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,392
one of them is right.

558
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,491
If I have the immunity idol, it

559
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,242
gives me a trump card.

560
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,160
I like the direction I'm going,

561
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,371
but I feel more comfortable with

562
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,705
the trump card in my pocket

563
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,748
knowing that the general public

564
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,874
doesn't have access to it right

565
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,960
now.

566
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,192
>> James, you eat a good one-

567
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,444
fourth of what's in there.

568
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,445
>> Oh, I do.

569
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,530
>> You average probably two and

570
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,407
a half times the average person.

571
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,492
>> I'm not like you.

572
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm not laying down...

573
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:22,744
>> No, no, no, don't say like

574
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,163
me.

575
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,080
When you were gone I was out

576
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:25,664
there fishing and I never ate

577
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,374
more than my fair portion, okay?

578
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,709
Please don't say like me.

579
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,377
>> We have been in the jungle

580
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,379
for 23 days now, and these

581
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,424
people are driving me insane.

582
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,258
I hate hearing Jean-Robert's

583
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,385
voice.

584
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,178
I hate hearing James complain

585
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,471
how he's so hungry.

586
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,681
Plus it kind of pisses me off

587
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,223
that James has both hidden

588
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,267
immunity idols, being that I

589
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,435
found it and told him where the

590
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,811
other one was, and he hasn't

591
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,563
even offered to give one back.

592
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,398
That drives me insane.

593
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,734
So I would love to see some

594
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,070
craziness happen here at camp.

595
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,286
>> James, he's got himself in a

596
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,829
great position.

597
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,039
With that hidden immunity idol,

598
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:07,623
he's guaranteed in the final

599
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,791
four.

600
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,085
You know it.

601
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,048
Yeah, people would be like, "You

602
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,090
played a great game James.

603
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,426
You did fantastic, here you go."

604
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,222
What if he keeps winning,

605
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,432
winning, idol, idol?

606
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,892
Hell, no am I messing with two

607
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,352
idols like that.

608
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,478
If James doesn't win immunity,

609
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,147
he might have to go.

610
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,984
If he's guaranteed that Peih-Gee

611
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:36,568
is going, he won't play that

612
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,071
idol.

613
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,114
>> The plan was originally to

614
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,366
get rid of Peih-Gee next, and

615
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,993
then Erik and Frosti after that.

616
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:45,661
Now, all of a sudden, Todd is in

617
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,371
a big hurry to get rid of James,

618
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,040
and him changing so quickly,

619
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:56,296
like, really makes me nervous.

620
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,464
>> You know what I mean?

621
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,507
>> Yeah.

622
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,884
>> And...

623
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,848
We will not tell Peih-Gee.

624
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,849
>> All right.

625
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,809
>> Because we can't, because she

626
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,434
will tell James.

627
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,477
>> In this game, you've got to

628
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,312
take advantage of whatever

629
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,647
happens whenever you can.

630
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,148
And right now, people are

631
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,483
starting to view me as a swing

632
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,484
vote, which ends up being not so

633
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,445
bad.

634
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,406
>> Sound good?

635
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:26,076
Sounds good.

636
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,202
>> I'm always looking for a

637
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:27,744
chance to make sure that I'm

638
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,122
safe, so right now, the plan is

639
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,498
to not let James win immunity at

640
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,292
this next challenge and

641
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:39,923
blindside him at tribal tonight.

642
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,550
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

643
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,229
You guys ready to get to today's

644
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:55,272
immunity challenge?

645
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:55,522
>> Yeah!

646
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,274
>> JEFF: First things first.

647
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,150
Frosti, you mind bringing it

648
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,485
over?

649
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,079
Once again, immunity is back up

650
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:11,580
for grabs.

651
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,665
For today's challenge, you are

652
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,541
going to balance on a large

653
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,668
barrel that is filled with

654
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,336
water.

655
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,629
There is a hole on the bottom of

656
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,256
the barrel.

657
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:21,923
As the water drains out, it will

658
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,134
become more and more unstable,

659
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,844
making it more difficult to keep

660
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,428
your balance.

661
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,514
When you fall off, you're out.

662
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,892
Last person left sitting on

663
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,560
their barrel wins immunity, is

664
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:38,315
guaranteed a one in eight shot

665
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,692
at a million dollars.

666
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,902
We've already drawn for

667
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,903
positions.

668
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,945
Take your spots.

669
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,323
We'll get started.

670
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,365
All right, here we go.

671
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,950
Everybody sit up straight.

672
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,827
First lever you're going to push

673
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,204
is the yellow lever.

674
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:52,704
That will pull the plug,

675
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,622
allowing the water to drain out

676
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,124
of your barrel.

677
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,710
Three, two, one, push.

678
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,462
Now, push the red one forward.

679
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,131
Keep in mind, when you push the

680
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,424
red one forward, your barrel is

681
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,052
now not locked anymore.

682
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,806
Three, two, one, push.

683
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,103
This challenge is underway.

684
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:16,603
Water draining out of

685
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,688
everybody's barrel.

686
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,564
Everybody's barrel is unlocked

687
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,650
and moving.

688
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,068
The only rules are your hands

689
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,194
and your feet can only touch

690
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,238
your barrel.

691
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:26,863
You cannot touch any part of the

692
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,573
structure in front of or behind

693
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,493
your barrel.

694
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,869
>> I don't think mine's balanced

695
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,537
properly, Jeff.

696
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,538
>> JEFF: Glad you're still

697
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,414
around, Jean-Robert.

698
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:36,957
Always need a complainer.

699
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,541
>> I thought I was the

700
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,501
complainer.

701
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,545
>> Whoa, whoa!

702
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,754
This sucks.

703
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,922
>> JEFF: James struggling a

704
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,464
little bit.

705
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,508
Denise wobbling just a little

706
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,218
bit.

707
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,637
Courtney is like a statue.

708
00:23:59,437 --> 00:23:59,855
>> Oh, man, I got an itch.

709
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,524
None of you guys are itching?

710
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,278
Your heads don't itch, anybody?

711
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,529
Those mosquito bites from last

712
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,697
night.

713
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,531
>> Shut up.

714
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,950
>> Bitch.

715
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,994
>> JEFF: James struggling.

716
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,164
Does a good job of recovering.

717
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:21,251
Jean-Robert playing around.

718
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,502
And it could cost him and it

719
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,087
does.

720
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:24,713
Jean-Robert's the first one out.

721
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,548
Take a spot on the bench.

722
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,759
Eight people left.

723
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,723
Denise really fighting it, and

724
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,474
Denise goes in the swamp.

725
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,767
Denise the second person out of

726
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,769
the challenge.

727
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:40,854
We are down to seven people

728
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:41,897
left.

729
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,064
Immunity on the line.

730
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,775
>> Whoa.

731
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,027
Gotcha.

732
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,278
>> JEFF: James struggling.

733
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:48,612
>> Whoa.

734
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,697
Whoa, whoa.

735
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,573
Whoa.

736
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,533
Come on.

737
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,203
>> JEFF: another good save by

738
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,747
James.

739
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,832
It is hot out here.

740
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,966
You've been on your barrels for

741
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,552
over 20 minutes now.

742
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,720
>> Oh, geez.

743
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,638
>> JEFF: Erik with a nice

744
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,015
recovery.

745
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,808
Peih-Gee shows the first sign of

746
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,769
trouble.

747
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,603
Courtney still looking solid.

748
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,606
James struggling again.

749
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,691
Can he make another recovery?

750
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,692
No.

751
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,736
James is the third person out of

752
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,987
this challenge.

753
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,489
>> ♪ Don don don... ♪

754
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,448
>> JEFF: Take a spot on the

755
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,324
bench.

756
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:34,950
We are down to six people left

757
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,535
in this challenge.

758
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,874
Todd starting to struggle a bit

759
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,834
now.

760
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,586
Erik struggling.

761
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,672
Can he get it back?

762
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,756
And Erik goes in.

763
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,715
Erik is the fourth person out of

764
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,969
this challenge.

765
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,428
Peih-Gee and Amanda struggling a

766
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,721
bit.

767
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,644
Peih-Gee fighting it, and loses

768
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,188
the battle.

769
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:05,814
Peih-Gee is the fifth person out

770
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,817
of this challenge.

771
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,530
Whoa, Amanda, hands off.

772
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:13,863
Amanda's out.

773
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,324
Touched the structure.

774
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,034
Amanda is the sixth person out

775
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,953
of the challenge.

776
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,955
We are down to three-- Courtney,

777
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,916
Frosti, Todd.

778
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,295
All fighting for immunity.

779
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:33,925
>> ♪ Starving artist

780
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,802
on the dragon ♪

781
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,096
>> Frosti's singing.

782
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:38,805
>> ♪ Balancing on barrels

783
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,017

784
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,443
>> JEFF: Todd is the seventh

785
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,361
person out of this challenge.

786
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,946
And then there were two.

787
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,239
>> Lovers.

788
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:56,823
>> JEFF: Courtney and Frosti

789
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,867
sitting side by side.

790
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,162
Courtney has not moved in 32

791
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:02,746
minutes.

792
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,124
>> I am lazy.

793
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,130
>> That sucks.

794
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:12,839
That sucks.

795
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,760
Oh... no, never mind.

796
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,530
>> JEFF: Frosti tries to

797
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,157
recover.

798
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,325
Can't do it.

799
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,910
Frosti's out.

800
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,121
Courtney wins immunity!

801
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,247
>> Thanks, guys.

802
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,916
>> JEFF: Courtney, come on over.

803
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,210
>> It's almost like a pageant.

804
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:50,710
>> Good job, Courtney.

805
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,380
>> JEFF: Courtney, you are safe

806
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:53,922
tonight at tribal council.

807
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,881
With this around your neck, you

808
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,758
cannot be voted out.

809
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,259
Courtney has a one in eight shot

810
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,511
at a million dollars.

811
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,596
For the rest of you, tonight,

812
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,889
one of you going home.

813
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:03,973
You have the afternoon to figure

814
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,058
out who it's going to be.

815
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,351
Grab your stuff, head back to

816
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,977
camp.

817
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,706
>> Thank you.

818
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,170
I did win immunity today.

819
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,171
I didn't think I would ever win

820
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,923
anything.

821
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:37,966
(<i> laughs</i> )

822
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,259
So I pretty much don't care at

823
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:39,843
this point who gets voted out.

824
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,928
I'm immune tonight, so can't get

825
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,847
me.

826
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,810
Nope.

827
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,145
>> I was crushed I didn't win it

828
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,730
today, because I know I'm next

829
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,107
on the chopping block.

830
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,317
I've been really trying to

831
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,944
scramble and save my ass, and

832
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,655
Denise seemed really open to the

833
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,532
idea of voting with me and my

834
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,284
other allies.

835
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,411
So hopefully it will get me

836
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,621
through one more tribal council.

837
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,924
>> I thought you were on the

838
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,842
chopping block because you were

839
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,885
getting votes.

840
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:22,927
>> Actually, right now I might

841
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,971
not get as many votes.

842
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,181
>> Things have changed?

843
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,558
>> I think they... yeah.

844
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,018
I... I have the hidden immunity

845
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,980
idol.

846
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,482
Yeah.

847
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,816
Now that I have it, I look like

848
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,942
I'm pretty much guaranteed top

849
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,236
five for sure right now.

850
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,362
>> I was trying to think, how

851
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,363
can I keep me in the game

852
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,531
longer, and then Jean-Robert

853
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,366
told me he had the idol, and

854
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,034
that changed everything.

855
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,661
'Cause I'm 99% positive that

856
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,829
James has it.

857
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,207
What would you say if I told you

858
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,000
I was pretty sure that you

859
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,335
didn't have the right immunity

860
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,669
idol?

861
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,212
>> I'd say that you probably

862
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,880
don't have as many clues as I

863
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,173
do.

864
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,966
>> Okay, I'm willing to share

865
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,510
with you what I know.

866
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,677
>> Okay.

867
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,971
>> James comes over to our camp,

868
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,681
and that little block from the

869
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,849
archway, we looked in James' bag

870
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,061
and there were two of them.

871
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,357
>> But...

872
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,399
>> Because there's two hidden

873
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,151
immunity idols.

874
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,069
>> There's two hidden immunity

875
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:21,277
idols?

876
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:21,861
>> One in each camp.

877
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,696
And I'm almost positive James

878
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,115
has them.

879
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,165
Okay.

880
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,917
Hmmm.

881
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,335
How sick is that?

882
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:37,877
And this is the guy who is

883
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,920
favored to win every challenge

884
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,004
from here out.

885
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,048
I'll tell what you we can do.

886
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,759
We'll keep this on the DL.

887
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,031
>> Have you been looking?

888
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:07,991
What have you come up with?

889
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,075
>> What I came up with is the

890
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,035
realization that you're holding

891
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,287
out on me.

892
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,663
That's what I came up with.

893
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,622
>> I don't know what the hell

894
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,873
you're talking about.

895
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,834
>> Yes, you do.

896
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,668
>> No, I don't.

897
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,377
>> Yes, you do.

898
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,003
You had to know I was going to

899
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:20,628
figure it out sooner or later.

900
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,838
>> Figure what out?

901
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,006
>> You have two immunity idols.

902
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,048
Two of them, and you can't tell

903
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:24,299
your boy?

904
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,509
Nobody told me, bro.

905
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,344
Who else do you think would

906
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,053
figure something out like that

907
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,557
except for me?

908
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,434
Come on.

909
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,185
Okay.

910
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:36,978
>> Jean-Robert was just fishing

911
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,188
for answers.

912
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,231
I don't know what he was trying

913
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,190
to pull.

914
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,233
He knows I don't like being

915
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,151
sequestered or cornered, like he

916
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,193
was so cunning he'd fool me in

917
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,111
some way.

918
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,070
>> Now I'm not even going to ask

919
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:46,946
you anymore.

920
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,530
I'm telling you that I already

921
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,156
know, and I'm leaving it up to

922
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,283
you to decide-- do you want to

923
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,659
work with me or are we going on

924
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,869
our own?

925
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,287
The best course to the end is

926
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,705
always going to be with me,

927
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,748
not against me.

928
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,042
It cannot work up on the well

929
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,126
with you if you don't go with

930
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:00,293
me.

931
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:00,960
>> I might look like a dumb

932
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,879
monkey, and just fall for

933
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:03,880
anything, but I'm really not.

934
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:04,339
I mean, come on, dude.

935
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,173
You're Jean-Robert.

936
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,091
You can't trust anything that

937
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,343
comes out of your mouth anyway.

938
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:08,968
Why would I align with you?

939
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,179
That would be the worst move of

940
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,555
<i>Survivor</i> history to align with

941
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,224
that guy.

942
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,482
>> James kept playing dumb like

943
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,566
he doesn't know what I was

944
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,150
talking about, and he didn't

945
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,235
make any kind of offer about

946
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,195
what we could do with this

947
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,154
advantage together.

948
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,072
Now I feel like it's kind of

949
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,824
fair game.

950
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,499
Big, big news.

951
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,417
>> I know where the idol is, and

952
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,335
there's not just one idol.

953
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,169
There's two idols.

954
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,128
>> You're talking about James,

955
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:44,337
right?

956
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,004
>> He has both idols.

957
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,756
>> Okay.

958
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,465
>> How did you know that?

959
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,174
>> I was just... I've heard

960
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,008
hearsay.

961
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,051
>> He has both idols.

962
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,344
Here's the thing-- we could

963
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,345
blindside him tonight, because

964
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,846
he will not pull out the idol

965
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,931
tonight.

966
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,183
>> I know, I know.

967
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,229
Let's see how it goes today.

968
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,814
You know, it's really funny-- I

969
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,232
had an original idea to take

970
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,566
James out, and then Jean-Robert

971
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,068
just came up with the same idea,

972
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,152
and I was kind of bothered by

973
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,195
the fact that he's coming up

974
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,071
with all these ideas I've had

975
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,073
for days now.

976
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,658
So I'm always entertaining

977
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,826
options.

978
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,743
I could change my mind in two

979
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,911
minutes.

980
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:17,870
Who knows?

981
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,871
This game is fun, and I like

982
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,499
keeping it fun.

983
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,170
>> He right now has Erik and

984
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,172
possibly Peih-Gee and Frosti.

985
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,257
That's four.

986
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,299
And I'm five.

987
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,509
He thinks you're going tonight.

988
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,719
I played it up.

989
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,262
Like, "Yeah, okay, this sounds

990
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,430
like a good idea."

991
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,265
But should we do Jean-Robert

992
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,059
tonight?

993
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,061
We don't want to tell Denise or

994
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,896
no?

995
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,230
>> No.

996
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,649
Denise wavering, and Denise

997
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,859
getting pissed off.

998
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,860
>> I still think we should get

999
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,861
rid of Peih-Gee tonight and the

1000
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,070
Jean-Robert next time.

1001
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:51,696
Todd is all over the place right

1002
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,155
now.

1003
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,240
One person comes up to him, he

1004
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,116
rethinks his whole strategy.

1005
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,243
He's second-guessing himself.

1006
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,536
And in this game, you have to be

1007
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,371
confident about your choices.

1008
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,998
So I really don't know what's

1009
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,124
going to happen at this point.

1010
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,333
>> Here's Courtney.

1011
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,794
>> Courtney, come here.

1012
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,009
>> Um...

1013
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:13,342
I don't know.

1014
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,553
I mean... I don't know.

1015
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,221
I mean... well, I don't... it's

1016
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,890
up to you guys.

1017
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,891
I don't give a crap.

1018
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,725
I'm not entirely sure what

1019
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,517
happened, but all of a sudden,

1020
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,477
Todd decided to vote for Jean-

1021
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,853
Robert.

1022
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,897
>> I think our best bet is Jean-

1023
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,150
Robert tonight.

1024
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,860
>> It's a widely known fact that

1025
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,653
Jean-Robert and I have hated

1026
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,071
each other since day one.

1027
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,865
So if everyone's finally willing

1028
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,784
to vote him out, then great.

1029
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,160
But he's become the Susan Lucci

1030
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,119
of tribal council.

1031
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,121
Like, his name is always up

1032
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,122
there, but he never quite gets

1033
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,290
voted out.

1034
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,374
So I don't have much faith that

1035
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,127
it will actually happen.

1036
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,128
>> I knew Jean-Robert was going

1037
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,589
to try something, and I'm just

1038
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,757
going to have to deal with it.

1039
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,425
Hopefully I'll make it through.

1040
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,593
I don't know if I will take the

1041
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,469
idols with me, because I

1042
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,637
shouldn't have to use them.

1043
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,679
So I might just roll the dice

1044
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,931
tonight.

1045
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:00,556
As long as I make it to the next

1046
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,725
one, I should be all right.

1047
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,936
But, I mean, you never know.

1048
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,247
>> JEFF: I'll now bring in the

1049
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,500
first member of our jury.

1050
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,879
Jaime, voted out at the last

1051
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,299
tribal council.

1052
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,718
Just remind you the jury is here

1053
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,012
to observe, not to interact.

1054
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,305
Courtney, would you have ever

1055
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,766
guessed that you would be here

1056
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,226
on day 24 wearing the immunity

1057
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,270
necklace?

1058
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,312
>> Hell no!

1059
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,606
(<i> applause</i> )

1060
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,024
But if I was going to win a

1061
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,442
challenge, you better believe it

1062
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,069
was one that involved not

1063
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,279
falling in the swamp.

1064
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,864
>> JEFF: James, this is the

1065
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,282
second tribal council you've

1066
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,283
been at without immunity.

1067
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,618
You're one of the biggest

1068
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,036
physical threats in this game.

1069
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,620
Do you get more concerned with

1070
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,414
each tribal that maybe tonight

1071
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,456
is your night?

1072
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,875
>> Yes, I do.

1073
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,293
I am the biggest physical threat

1074
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,210
but the far greater threats are

1075
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,547
the talkers, the ones who could

1076
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,215
form alliances easier, that

1077
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,217
would trade up and switch around

1078
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,635
and do all kinds of other stuff.

1079
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,512
>> JEFF: Peih-Gee, if you look

1080
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,055
at the tribe tonight, you still

1081
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,390
have a great number of Fei Long

1082
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,766
members, and you have you,

1083
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,810
Frosti, and Erik.

1084
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,396
>> Yeah, Erik and I are the only

1085
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,647
ones that brought our stuff, so,

1086
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,815
obviously, I think we're the

1087
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:33,900
only ones who think that we're

1088
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,984
going home.

1089
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,027
You know, like, I was devastated

1090
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,153
losing that challenge today, and

1091
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,738
it's tough.

1092
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,031
It's really hard.

1093
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:40,573
>> JEFF: Jean-Robert, how

1094
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,201
frustrated would you be if the

1095
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,827
situation were reversed and you

1096
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,203
were sitting in Peih-Gee's or

1097
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,371
Erik's shoes?

1098
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,497
>> I would be really frustrated,

1099
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,457
because they're this a really

1100
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,541
bad position right now, really

1101
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,500
bad position.

1102
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,460
I mean, they've had really bad

1103
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,502
cards thrown at them.

1104
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,004
They basically got the deuce-

1105
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,213
seven off suit in a no limit

1106
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,256
game.

1107
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,133
And they've come in a situation,

1108
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:00,009
it's pretty much have

1109
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:00,968
inevitable.

1110
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:01,802
>> JEFF: Erik, agree with Jean-

1111
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,970
Robert, disagree?

1112
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,554
>> It's, of course, tough, but

1113
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,681
everybody else that's left from

1114
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,307
Fei Long is going to realize,

1115
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,559
like, if I have six people,

1116
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,852
somebody's at the bottom of

1117
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,978
that, and I'm not just saying

1118
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,021
that to lobby.

1119
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:12,647
I'm just saying, like, if I know

1120
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,732
I'm going to go fifth or sixth,

1121
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,400
I'm going to start thinking

1122
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,652
before that.

1123
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,028
And I'm not saying that to try

1124
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,154
and sell people.

1125
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:20,696
That is how this game has to

1126
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,239
work.

1127
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,157
People are going to have to

1128
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,158
split.

1129
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,117
>> JEFF: James you're throwing

1130
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,077
your hands up.

1131
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,036
>> I mean, he's so cute what he

1132
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:27,662
says like he's trying to play it

1133
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,496
up.

1134
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,831
But I like... I like it.

1135
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,083
He's beautiful.

1136
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,502
He's working it.

1137
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,128
He's working it right now.

1138
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,297
Already.

1139
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,757
>> JEFF: Jean-Robert, at the

1140
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,341
last tribal council, Jaime

1141
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,551
played what she thought was a

1142
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,928
hidden immunity idol.

1143
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,930
How does the notion that there

1144
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,181
could be a hidden immunity idol

1145
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,557
change the game?

1146
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,725
>> When Jaime presented that

1147
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,726
last week, I thought I was going

1148
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,519
home.

1149
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,687
When your job is being the local

1150
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,396
jerk...

1151
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,398
(<i> laughter</i> )

1152
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,399
...as the local jerk, I will

1153
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,483
probably have my name on a

1154
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,819
ballot or two maybe three every

1155
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:00,903
time.

1156
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,529
But if somebody happens to place

1157
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,447
that idol at the right time,

1158
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,907
that could be me going home.

1159
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,075
That's scary.

1160
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,368
>> JEFF: Amanda, is it true that

1161
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,661
every time you come to tribal

1162
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,328
you truly believe it could be

1163
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,413
you?

1164
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,581
>> Every time you come here, you

1165
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,667
expect to be going because,

1166
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,501
anybody could be doing things

1167
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,461
that you don't know about.

1168
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,297
So I don't like coming to tribal

1169
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,506
council, and I'm not

1170
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,757
comfortable.

1171
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,175
I'm not.

1172
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,593
>> JEFF: Okay, Courtney, you

1173
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,721
have individual immunity.

1174
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,014
As always, if you want to give

1175
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,099
it up to somebody else, you can.

1176
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,142
>> No.

1177
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,184
Screw you guys.

1178
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,185
>> JEFF: Courtney's going to

1179
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,061
keep it.

1180
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:34,895
You cannot vote for Courtney.

1181
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,604
Everybody else is fair game.

1182
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,480
It is time to vote.

1183
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,691
Todd, you're up.

1184
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,455
>> I hope this is the last time

1185
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,581
I have to vote for you.

1186
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,042
Maybe we all can sleep now.

1187
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,015
>> Peih-Gee, I'm voting for you.

1188
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:11,974
You just happened to get on the

1189
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,477
wrong tribe.

1190
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,402
>> You've played an incredible

1191
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,445
game, my friend.

1192
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,404
That's why we've got to send you

1193
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,698
packing.

1194
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,377
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1195
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,545
votes.

1196
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,222
Once the votes are read, the

1197
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:51,639
decision is final.

1198
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,431
The person voted out will be

1199
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,432
asked to leave the tribal

1200
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,600
council area immediately.

1201
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,602
If anyone has a hidden immunity

1202
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,145
idol, now is the time to play

1203
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,605
it.

1204
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,529
I'll read the votes.

1205
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:12,952
First vote, Jean-Robert.

1206
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,329
Jean-Robert.

1207
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,539
Two votes Jean-Robert.

1208
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,835
Peih-Gee.

1209
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,752
Two votes Jean-Robert, one vote

1210
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,004
Peih-Gee.

1211
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,674
James.

1212
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,675
Two votes Jean-Robert, one vote

1213
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,760
Peih-Gee, one vote James.

1214
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:32,638
James.

1215
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,473
That's two votes James, two

1216
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,850
votes Jean-Robert.

1217
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,893
One vote Peih-Gee.

1218
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,188
James.

1219
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,314
That's three votes James, two

1220
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,816
votes Jean-Robert, one vote

1221
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,110
Peih-Gee.

1222
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,113
Jean-Robert.

1223
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,197
We're tied.

1224
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,323
Three votes Jean-Robert, three

1225
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,910
votes James, one vote Peih-Gee.

1226
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,454
Jean-Robert.

1227
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,789
That's four votes Jean-Robert.

1228
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,624
Three votes James, one vote

1229
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,711
Peih-Gee, one vote left.

1230
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:11,760
Eighth person voted out and the

1231
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,929
second member of our jury, Jean-

1232
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,222
Robert.

1233
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,641
You need to bring me your torch.

1234
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,860
Jean-Robert, the tribe has

1235
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,112
spoken.

1236
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,617
Time for you to go.

1237
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,754
Well, I think tonight's vote

1238
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,923
speaks for itself.

1239
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,632
Tribal lines are gone.

1240
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,717
This is a brand-new game.

1241
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,843
Grab your torches.

1242
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,677
Head back to camp.

1243
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,595
Good night.

people that I don't like.

>> Blame.

1259

1261
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,712
tribal council.

1262
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,672
Tonight you will not be heading

1263
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,048
directly back to camp.

1264
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,049
We have more business to attend

1265
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,343
to here.

1266
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,058
>> I really loved the way I

1267
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,184
played this game.

1268
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,310
If I were to relate what

1269
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,770
happened to a game of poker, I

1270
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,272
pushed all in and it didn't work

1271
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:46,689
out for me.

1272
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,607
But I'm playing for first, and

1273
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,900
the only person who really

1274
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,026
threatened that first-place

1275
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,569
position for me was James.

1276
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,612
But I think they realized that I

1277
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,822
probably was the best player in

1278
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,823
the game, and they would feel a

1279
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,949
lot more comfortable with me out

1280
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,118
of the game.
