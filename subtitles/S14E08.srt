00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,460
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,170
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,296
Lisi returned from Exile

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,506
Island...

5
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,549
>> Welcome home, baby!

6
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:08,675
>> PROBST: ...and joined the new

7
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,718
all-male Ravu tribe.

8
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,677
>> Back at Moto, I didn't like

9
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,011
her, she didn't like me.

10
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,054
So she should be worried.

11
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,305
>> I'm with the boys!

12
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,598
>> PROBST: She didn't realize

13
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,559
that Alex, Edgardo, Dreamz, and

14
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,811
Mookie had already formed a

15
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,938
tight alliance of four.

16
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,232
At the new Moto, Yau-Man

17
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,192
discovered the hidden immunity

18
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,277
idol.

19
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,403
>> This is my million dollars!

20
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,487
>> PROBST: And he realized

21
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,363
another one existed on Ravu's

22
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,740
beach.

23
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,949
>> I know there's another one

24
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:33,533
somewhere on the other island.

25
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,994
>> PROBST: At a fiery reward

26
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,121
challenge...

27
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,789
Dreamz with a big launch.

28
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,206
Is it enough?

29
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,167
It is!

30
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,126
Dreamz secured a victory for

31
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,127
Ravu.

32
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,212
Ravu wins their first challenge!

33
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,922
And they were whisked away to a

34
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,175
remote arcade, where they gorged

35
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,177
on hot dogs, beer, and brownies.

36
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,512
>> As soon as we saw the food it

37
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,638
was like a feeding frenzy, man.

38
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,599
This is terrible.

39
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,892
>> PROBST: And then paid the

40
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,059
price.

41
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,603
>> I just ate way too much food.

42
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,645
>> You guys better be ready for

43
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,480
the challenge soon.

44
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,522
>> PROBST: Rocky showed no

45
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,440
sympathy.

46
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,775
>> You got what you wanted.

47
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,151
Suck it up.

48
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,277
>> Follow the rail!

49
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,153
Follow the rail!

50
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,696
>> PROBST: At an injury-laden

51
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,822
immunity challenge...

52
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,239
>> Mookie, run!

53
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,240
>> Cannibal, cannibal.

54
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,283
>> PROBST: ...Moto again claimed

55
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,326
immunity.

56
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,078
Cannibal Island is correct!

57
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,371
Moto wins immunity!

58
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,166
And Ravu was forced to choose

59
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,667
yet another tribemate to leave

60
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,085
the game.

61
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,003
>> I hate going to tribal

62
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:27,879
council.

63
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,755
>> What do you think?

64
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,756
>> I think you should (<i> bleep</i> )

65
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,673
push over a little bit unless

66
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,925
you want to make out with me.

67
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:32,550
>> PROBST: Rocky's attitude had

68
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,259
him on the bubble.

69
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,678
>> Rocky has just this bad vibe

70
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,888
about him, and I think one of

71
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,681
the reasons that Ravu didn't

72
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,307
ever win was his attitude about

73
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,184
stuff.

74
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,393
>> The idol is on this island.

75
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,269
It's here.

76
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,354
>> PROBST: And in order to save

77
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,438
herself, Lisi revealed clues to

78
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,397
the whereabouts of the hidden

79
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,524
idol.

80
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,858
>> With the clues I have, you,

81
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,276
me, and Edgardo should start

82
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,361
prowling around the island.

83
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,445
>> Alex and I figured out that

84
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,404
we don't need really strong

85
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,489
players.

86
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,657
What we need is people that are

87
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,991
loyal.

88
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,617
>> PROBST: At tribal council...

89
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,661
The seventh person voted out and

90
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,246
the first member of our jury.

91
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,580
...Rocky was blindsided and

92
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,873
become the first member of our

93
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,958
jury.

94
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,417
Rocky, the tribe has spoken.

95
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,461
11 are left.

96
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:35,446
Who will be voted out tonight?

97
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,031
>> Edgardo and I are sort of in

98
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:37,574
between a couple alliances.

99
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,492
It seems like he and I are

100
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,245
aligned with Mookie and Dreamz

101
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,496
on the one hand, and we're

102
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,455
aligned with Lisi on the other

103
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,373
hand.

104
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,666
Edgardo and myself had a

105
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,876
previous alliance with her when

106
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,418
we were all part of Moto.

107
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,503
So right now I feel like I'm in

108
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:59,137
a pretty good place.

109
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,762
After Lisi got back from Exile

110
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,388
Island, she told Alex and me two

111
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,431
clues.

112
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,600
One of the clues was "It's at

113
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,310
the highest point in the island.

114
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,644
Dig down."

115
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,229
And the other clue said, "Dig

116
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,732
beneath where you sleep."

117
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,492
So myself, Alex, and Edgardo

118
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,202
were digging for the idol while

119
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,080
Lisi and Dreamz were sleeping.

120
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,500
>> A little left, six inches.

121
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,253
Right there.

122
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,297
>> I know that myself, Dreamz,

123
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,798
Edgardo, and Alex made a pact

124
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,382
together.

125
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,636
But I need to figure out how I'm

126
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,262
going to secure my space within

127
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,140
this trust.

128
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,864
I was digging in the right place

129
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,658
at the right time, and I don't

130
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,076
know how they didn't hear that,

131
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,660
but I got the immunity idol.

132
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,494
Hopefully it's smooth sailing

133
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,914
from here.

134
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,908
>> Lisi let us in on basically

135
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,909
all the clues to find the

136
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,828
immunity idol.

137
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,037
So we started digging, we

138
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,288
adjusted a little bit, and lo

139
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,164
and behold, the three of us

140
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,207
found it while everyone else was

141
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,210
asleep.

142
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,254
>> There is no words to describe

143
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,588
how much this means to me in

144
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,425
this game.

145
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,343
So to bring this back, it holds

146
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,762
my position for sure.

147
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,906
>> The reason we didn't tell

148
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,949
Lisi is because even though she

149
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:25,491
is really loyal, she's an

150
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:25,867
unstable person.

151
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,994
We were afraid that if we told

152
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,121
her, she would want to use it

153
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,123
the wrong way, just because I

154
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:32,749
don't think Lisi is a very smart

155
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,667
person playing the game.

156
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,877
>> Don't tell Dreamz.

157
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,836
>> Don't tell him until it's

158
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,172
necessary.

159
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,134
>> We're not telling Dreamz

160
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,510
about the immunity idol because

161
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,346
he's very close with Cassandra,

162
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,680
and if there is a merge, he may

163
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,308
have just a flareup of, like,

164
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,851
complete honesty and tell

165
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:52,602
Cassandra, tell who knows what

166
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,395
about the immunity idol.

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,646
And once they know we have it,

168
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,815
its effect is gone.

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,445
>> You can say that myself, Alex

170
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,654
and Edgardo have the idol, but

171
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,325
in my mind, it's in one pocket,

172
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,078
and that's in my pocket.

173
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,891
>> A little idol digging?

174
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,392
>> Yeah.

175
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,477
>> Yeah, that's where I suspect

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,229
it is, right around there.

177
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:36,854
It's got to be right here where

178
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,731
we're sleeping.

179
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,817
I suspect Alex told Mookie that

180
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,526
the idol is right where we

181
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,653
sleep.

182
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,863
Because this morning Mookie

183
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,240
tried to be, like, a little

184
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,407
discreet, flipping leaves and

185
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,450
trying to play with the ground,

186
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,868
and I was like, "What, idol

187
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,328
digging?"

188
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,871
And he had no choice but to say,

189
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,123
"Uh, yeah."

190
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,207
I'm like, "Dude, you're going to

191
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,166
have to wake up really, really

192
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,376
early to fool an old cat like

193
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,418
me.

194
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,670
What's wrong with you?"

195
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,726
>> I have the idol, and Lisi is

196
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,103
still digging for it.

197
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,146
She has no idea.

198
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,021
And I'm going to help her dig.

199
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,315
And that's the funny part.

200
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,700
>> Oh, my god!

201
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,330
>><i> Hola.</i>

202
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:36,664
>><i> Hola.</i>

203
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,499
>><i> Hola.</i>

204
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,668
>> Great, you guys, come on with

205
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,212
us!

206
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,885
>> Today, you will learn a

207
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,511
traditional Fijian miki, a

208
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,804
dance.

209
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,889
>> Oh, my god!

210
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,849
>> The skilled Fijian dancers

211
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,725
are here to teach you how to do

212
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,642
it.

213
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,226
They will instruct you for two

214
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:57,643
hours.

215
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,561
>> You will compete against the

216
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,520
other tribe this afternoon and

217
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,190
try to outdance them at a local

218
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:02,648
village.

219
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,649
The winners stay for a feast at

220
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,652
the village.

221
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,778
>> It looks like we have a

222
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,363
dance-off competition with Ravu

223
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,073
today.

224
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:11,699
And we had some Fijian dancers

225
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,701
come and school us.

226
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,995
And then if we win we get a nice

227
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,663
spread of food.

228
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,748
>> We have to sit one person

229
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,499
out.

230
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,334
>> One person out.

231
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,251
>> I'm all knees here when

232
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,127
dancing.

233
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:23,961
>> Well, you're sitting out.

234
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,504
>> When it comes to dancing, I

235
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,173
have absolutely no rhythm.

236
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,217
I can't keep the beat if my life

237
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,801
depends on it.

238
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:42,855
>> I got the moves.

239
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,899
I got the moves.

240
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,858
You know, I had to pull out some

241
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,734
of my Michael Jackson moves, you

242
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,652
know?

243
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,277
They put me up front, and I'm

244
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,697
ready to take the lead.

245
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,408
>> That's a little too much

246
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,785
hips, Boo.

247
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,119
>> It was funny seeing Boo, you

248
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,538
know?

249
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,538
Boo was doing the whole... the

250
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,748
white guy thing.

251
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,332
But he hung in there, and he's

252
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,625
making a great effort at it.

253
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,169
I think we'll be okay.

254
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,603
>> Size, strength, and agility

255
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,771
is not necessarily going to be

256
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,524
an advantage on this one.

257
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,608
There's no way Yau-Man and those

258
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,192
girls are going to beat us at

259
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,568
this.

260
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,569
I mean, it's kind of

261
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,570
frustrating, right?

262
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,154
Because we've lost twice to a

263
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:32,822
bunch of girls and an old guy.

264
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,075
If we don't all work in unison,

265
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,952
we don't eat.

266
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,413
>> (<i> speaking in Fijian</i>

267
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,541
<i>language</i> )

268
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:43,791
>> Okay.

269
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,668
Okay.

270
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,545
>> Challenges, honestly, I don't

271
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,963
take seriously.

272
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,256
I don't think we should be out

273
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,799
here brooding about "We've got

274
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,301
to win," or "We've got to eat

275
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,594
that food!"

276
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,097
I mean, come on, guys.

277
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,524
>> I really don't like Lisi.

278
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:09,650
Lisi was one of the reasons that

279
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,444
I was so miserable at Moto.

280
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,737
Every challenge she's done has

281
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,988
been horrible.

282
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,156
So Lisi should be worried,

283
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,157
because she's the weakest, and

284
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,283
we're trying to get to the merge

285
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,284
with numbers up.

286
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,243
If we lose a challenge, she will

287
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,579
be the next person voted off.

288
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,104
>> PROBST: Moto, come on in!

289
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,906
Moto looking good.

290
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,492
Ravu, come on in!

291
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,951
Moto getting your first look at

292
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,745
the new Ravu tribe.

293
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,163
Rocky voted out at the last

294
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,373
tribal council.

295
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:05,956
He became the first member of

296
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,709
the jury.

297
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,919
Everybody go ahead and have a

298
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,670
seat.

299
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,923
Glad to see everybody has

300
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,674
embraced today so far.

301
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,926
>> For real.

302
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,886
>> PROBST: Are you guys ready to

303
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,804
get to today's challenge?

304
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,846
>> Yeah.

305
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,389
>> PROBST: All right, this

306
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,391
morning you were taught a meke,

307
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,267
which is a traditional dance.

308
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,602
Today you will get the

309
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,771
opportunity to perform this meke

310
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,524
in front of some Fijian judges.

311
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,109
You will be judged on three

312
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,903
criteria-- your appearance,

313
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,863
authenticity, and, of course,

314
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,157
spirit.

315
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,910
Did you embrace the dance?

316
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,745
Our judges are all experts in

317
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,830
Fijian dance.

318
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,624
They will determine the winner.

319
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,291
Want to know what you're playing

320
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,709
for?

321
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:50,960
>> Yeah.

322
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,295
>> PROBST: Your reward is a

323
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,257
Fijian feast-- it is cooking

324
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,885
right now in a lovo-- of

325
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,931
chicken, pork, seafood.

326
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,933
You'll also enjoy some nice

327
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,143
Fijian singing.

328
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,561
In addition, the winning tribe

329
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,895
will send one member of the

330
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,231
losing tribe to Exile Island.

331
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:12,940
They will return in time for the

332
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,568
next immunity challenge.

333
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,069
Shall we get to it?

334
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,070
>> Yes.

335
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,029
>> PROBST: Moto, you have one

336
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:19,989
extra tribe member.

337
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,073
You had to decide this morning

338
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,283
who was going to sit out.

339
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:22,825
Based on how you guys look,

340
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm guessing it was Yau-Man.

341
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,662
>> Yes.

342
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,998
>> PROBST: Moto, you are up.

343
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:59,570
(<i> chanting</i> )

344
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,113
>> Meke!

345
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,679
(<i> applause</i> )

346
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,972
>> PROBST: Nicely done.

347
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,474
Have a seat back on your mat.

348
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,311
Ravu, the stage is yours.

349
00:13:40,069 --> 00:14:21,443
(<i> chanting</i> )

350
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,069

351
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,114
>> Argh!

00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,701
(<i> applause</i> )

353
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,994
>> PROBST: Nicely done.

354
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,496
Have a seat.

355
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,455
Give the judges a chance to

356
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,916
discuss.

357
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:45,384
(<i> inaudible conversation</i> )

358
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,554
You guys have made a decision?

359
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,597
>> Yes, Jeff.

360
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,431
>> PROBST: All right, tell me

361
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,265
first about Moto.

362
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,558
What did they do well and what

363
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,851
could they have improved on?

364
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,435
>> Moto, first of all, their

365
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:59,023
appearance, as Ravu, is good,

366
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,107
the way they dressed themselves

367
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,150
up.

368
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,067
>> PROBST: So both tribes you

369
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:02,568
thought did a good job?

370
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,152
>> Yes, they did a good job on

371
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,153
their appearance.

372
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,697
And also the spirit on both

373
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,241
teams were there.

374
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,034
>> PROBST: So you liked the

375
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,036
appearance equally.

376
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,245
>> Yes.

377
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,246
>> PROBST: And you liked spirit

378
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,247
equally?

379
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,206
>> Yes.

380
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,166
>> PROBST: So it's going to come

381
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,500
down, as it should, to how well

382
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,752
they did the actual dance.

383
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,962
>> Yes.

384
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,048
The actual dance, for Moto, the

385
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,883
group was... you know, they were

386
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,635
better organized.

387
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,595
And I think the leader was

388
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,180
really good.

389
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,016
Whereas Ravu, their body

390
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,061
movement was out of rhythm with

391
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,855
the chant.

392
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,273
They were either too fast again

393
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,983
or behind in their actions.

394
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,486
When it comes down to the final

395
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,988
point of coordination, I think

396
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,492
Moto...

397
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,960
>> PROBST: Judges, thank you

398
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,587
very much.

399
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,422
First thing we have to do, Moto,

400
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,590
somebody going directly to Exile

401
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,841
Island.

402
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,009
Who is it going to be?

403
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,844
>> Lisi.

404
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,970
>> PROBST: Lisi going back to

405
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:12,304
Exile Island.

406
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,055
Why Lisi, Earl?

407
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,973
>> So no one else will get any

408
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:15,182
clues.

409
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,644
>> All right, then.

410
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,603
>> PROBST: Lisi, the boat will

411
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,437
pick you up.

412
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,355
You'll be back in time for the

413
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,648
next immunity challenge.

414
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,649
All right, Ravu.

415
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,525
Unfortunately, I've got nothing

416
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,484
for you.

417
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,402
Grab your stuff, head on back to

418
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,612
camp.

419
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,868
Okay, Moto, you're going to

420
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,246
enjoy an authentic Fijian feast

421
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,080
that's been cooking for hours

422
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,958
especially for you.

423
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,836
Some singing, and it starts now.

424
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:46,922
>> One thing about being part of

425
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:47,798
this game, we haven't had a

426
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,841
chance to experience what's

427
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,759
here-- you know, the beauty of

428
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,802
Fiji and the people and the

429
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,636
natives.

430
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,470
We don't know anything.

431
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,471
And that was the first time we

432
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,723
got to actually absorb the

433
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,890
culture, and that's fascinating

434
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,267
to me.

435
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,108
>> Oh, my god!

436
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,276
It's so beautiful!

437
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
>> My mouth is, like, watering

438
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,074
right now.

439
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,284
The feast was the one of the

440
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,702
most incredible things that I've

441
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,287
ever experienced.

442
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,872
There were huge lobsters.

443
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,582
They had chicken, big pieces of

444
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,124
papaya.

445
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,292
We were eating with both our

446
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,169
hands.

447
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,045
It was just amazing-- the food,

448
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,172
the people, it was just

449
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,465
incredible.

450
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,132
Oh, my god, there's watermelon.

451
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,218
>> True feast here, baby.

452
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,846
>> Oh, my god, this is amazing.

453
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:36,305
>> It was incredible.

454
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,390
These people have such huge

455
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,600
hearts.

456
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,684
I don't think that any one of us

457
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,685
will ever forget this for the

458
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,979
rest of our lives.

459
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,111
>> A night like this brings us

460
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,572
closer together, because we were

461
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,032
still kind of separated.

462
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,074
You know, it was still kind of

463
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,368
some old Ravu and old Moto.

464
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,953
I mean, we still hadn't

465
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,288
connected all the way.

466
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,706
And I think a celebration like

467
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,917
this feels good as a group, that

468
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,543
we can finally push forward and

469
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,252
keep going as a solid group now.

470
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,755
This time it's our turn in the

471
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,382
sun, and I'm happy.

472
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,190
>> The game just gets so dark

473
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,358
sometimes.

474
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,027
Ravu just can't seem to win even

475
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,570
the simplest challenges.

476
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,363
This is kind of serious for

477
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,240
someone that likes to take it

478
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,034
light.

479
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,747
It sucks that I'm here.

480
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,373
I mean, like, look at me-- I'm a

481
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,374
moment away from crying.

482
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,709
I don't want to be here.

483
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,419
This sucks.

484
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,838
I really don't want to be here.

485
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,672
But what am I supposed to do,

486
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:56,426
man?

487
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,136
This sucks.

488
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,137
There's only so much of this I

489
00:18:59,221 --> 00:18:59,930
can take.

490
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,848
I don't want to let down Alex

491
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,640
and Edgardo, but I feel like

492
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,892
quitting.

493
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,420
>> Michelle and I have our usual

494
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,547
morning meetings, because I'm

495
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,965
usually the first person up, and

496
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:35,591
then she gets up pretty soon,

497
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,467
and everyone else is always just

498
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,677
laying there.

499
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,887
So we always get up, and she

500
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,470
briefs me on what's happening,

501
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,973
because she is my little spy.

502
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,809
I think, Boo, if you put Boo in

503
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,644
the right situation, he'll be

504
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,854
with us.

505
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,147
>> Uh-huh, yeah.

506
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,481
>> But I still wasn't sure,

507
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,482
because Cassandra said Boo is

508
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,442
dangerous.

509
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,902
If Boo makes the merger he'll be

510
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,736
the most dangerous.

511
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,988
I don't know.

512
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,701
>> Stacy's got that fourth card.

513
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,202
>> She wants to do that.

514
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:04,786
And that's what makes her a

515
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,496
little more dangerous because

516
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,332
her vote's going to switch.

517
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,292
>> That's why I feel like Stacy

518
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:10,918
first, because that will scare

519
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,460
Boo and get him on our side.

520
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,377
>> Yeah.

521
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,378
>> Earl and I are targeting

522
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,380
Stacy.

523
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,757
She still does have ties on the

524
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,175
other side, particularly with

525
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,676
Alex.

526
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,053
Ideally we'd want to get rid of

527
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,346
Stacy before the merge, because

528
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,680
that's when we feel like she'll

529
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,015
be most dangerous.

530
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,099
>> One of those two has to go at

531
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,726
the next immunity.

532
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,894
>> I feel like it will have to

533
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,311
be Stacy.

534
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,271
I am afraid that the longer

535
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,314
Stacy sticks around, the more in

536
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,401
danger it put me, because me and

537
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,070
Stacy are kind of carbon copies

538
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,321
of each other when it comes down

539
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,864
to function.

540
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,782
I don't think there's enough

541
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,408
room for the both of us.

542
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:46,995
>> We've got to get out of this

543
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,373
losing spirit.

544
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,211
>> I'm feeling confident, still.

545
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:54,836
I'm pretty sure tomorrow we're

546
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,546
going to merge.

547
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,724
>> Right now I'm really worried

548
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,517
that Dreamz might be tight with

549
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,352
Cassandra, and he might flip

550
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,812
over.

551
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,605
So I think I am going to keep my

552
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,982
eye on him because I know he is

553
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,067
going to be a threat.

554
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,745
>> This is pretty cool.

555
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,371
>> Interesting...

556
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,748
>> All right.

557
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,332
"Everybody gets their shot.

558
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,334
It's immunity you desire.

559
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,336
Ready, aim, make it count.

560
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,379
Tonight, somebody loses fire."

561
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,505
>> We need the next immunity

562
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,632
bad.

563
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,552
Going into a merge 4-6, much

564
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,554
harder than 5-5.

565
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,430
>> Ever shot a bow and arrow?

566
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,639
>> Yeah.

567
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,598
>> I haven't.

568
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,558
>> It's all about keeping your

569
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,600
arm straight.

570
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,476
>> When you release, you just

571
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,352
release your backhand like that

572
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,146
completely.

573
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,230
>> I never say I'm pretty good

574
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:55,897
at stuff, but I'm pretty good at

575
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,523
archery, I think.

576
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,399
>> Go for the harder shots,

577
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,358
whatever the hell they are.

578
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,235
>> I'm pretty sure of this

579
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,111
challenge because have a lot of

580
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:01,611
confidence in my archery

581
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,530
abilities.

582
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,323
I've been kind of low key in all

583
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:05,907
the challenges, just doing my

584
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,450
role, listening to people.

585
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,409
And I feel like this is my time

586
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,661
to shine.

587
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,543
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

588
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,760
We'll now bring in Lisi

589
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,304
returning from Exile Island.

590
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,435
>> What's going on, kids?

591
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,436
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

592
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,437
to today's immunity challenge?

593
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,272
>> Let's do it.

594
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,148
>> PROBST: First things first.

595
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,941
Take back the immunity idol.

596
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,526
You've got to let it go.

597
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,949
Once again, immunity is back up

598
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,533
for grabs.

599
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,494
For today's immunity challenge,

600
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,204
you will test your skills with

601
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,790
three different weapons.

602
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,291
First round is blow darts.

603
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,709
Each tribe member will get one

604
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,127
shot.

605
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,420
Whoever ends up closest to the

606
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,880
bull's eye scores one point for

607
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,715
their tribe.

608
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,008
Second round, you will throw

609
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,134
spears.

610
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:06,676
Closest to the bull's eye is

611
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,762
worth two points.

612
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,680
For the final round, you will

613
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,682
shoot a bow and arrow.

614
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,101
Closest to the bull's eye scores

615
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,602
three points for your tribe.

616
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,938
The tribe with the most points

617
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:18,605
wins immunity.

618
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,565
Losers will go to tribal

619
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,651
council, and for somebody, the

620
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,443
dream of winning this game will

621
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,528
come to an end.

622
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,612
Moto, you have one extra member.

623
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,823
Who are you going to sit out?

624
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,074
>> I will.

625
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,158
>> PROBST: Cassandra takes a

626
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,284
spot on the bench.

627
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,202
Everybody else, I'll give you a

628
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,036
minute to strategize and we'll

629
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,413
get started.

630
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,957
First round is blow darts.

631
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,499
Closer to the center of the

632
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,001
bull's eye scores a point for

633
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,378
your tribe.

634
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,923
Lisi first up.

635
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,842
She set the mark to beat.

636
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,511
Stacy up for Moto.

637
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,388
Moto now has the mark to beat.

638
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,557
>> There you go!

639
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,724
>> Yeah!

640
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,851
>> PROBST: Ravu up.

641
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,060
Mookie just inside of Stacy's

642
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,311
dart.

643
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:58,895
Ravu now has the mark to beat.

644
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,232
Moto back up.

645
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,817
Not enough lung capacity.

646
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,527
Dreamz trying to improve on

647
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,487
Mookie's shot.

648
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:12,159
And he does!

649
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,494
Yau-Man with a nice shot!

650
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,581
Moto now has the mark to beat.

651
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,499
Alex for Ravu.

652
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,793
Ravu back in the lead.

653
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,836
First round has been back and

654
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,547
forth.

655
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,799
Boo takes the lead back for

656
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,718
Moto!

657
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,221
Comes down to Edgardo for Ravu.

658
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,639
Ravu's last shot.

659
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,641
If Edgardo doesn't get this,

660
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,059
Moto wins the round, Earl

661
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,769
doesn't have to go.

662
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,985
And he does not.

663
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,278
Moto wins first round and the

664
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,697
first point.

665
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,538
Next round, throwing spears.

666
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,916
This round is worth two points.

667
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:05,420
Moto leads one point-zero.

668
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,755
Lisi does not get on the board

669
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,048
for Ravu.

670
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,091
Moto.

671
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,677
Ravu up.

672
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,929
Mookie going to try and set the

673
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,096
mark.

674
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,765
Mookie takes a toss.

675
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,058
That won't cut it.

676
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,310
Target still wide open.

677
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,898
Two-handed toss, made it halfway

678
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,524
down the course.

679
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,568
Ravu.

680
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,820
Just barely on the target, but

681
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,696
it will count.

682
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,325
Ravu now has the mark to beat.

683
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,411
Boo just short.

684
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,997
Ravu still in the lead.

685
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,625
Edgardo trying to improve the

686
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,085
mark set by his fellow tribemate

687
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,212
Dreamz.

688
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:51,675
He does not.

689
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,634
One good toss puts Moto back in

690
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,760
this.

691
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,594
>> Damn it.

692
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,762
>> PROBST: Yau-Man heads over

693
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,681
for Moto.

694
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,015
>> Come on, Yau-Man!

695
00:25:59,099 --> 00:25:59,641
Whoo!

696
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,060
>> PROBST: A lot of target open

697
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,979
there, Yau-Man.

698
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,816
Yau-Man pulling an Evel Knievel,

699
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,236
going way back.

700
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,660
And it works!

701
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,578
Yau-Man sets the new mark to

702
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,539
beat.

703
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,084
>> From the free throw line.

704
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,753
>> Michael Jordan!

705
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,214
>> Look at that muscle!

706
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,674
>> PROBST: Alex is Ravu's last

707
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,135
hope in this round.

708
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,386
Got to get inside the mark set

709
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,054
by Yau-Man.

710
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,639
This round is worth two points.

711
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,684
Moto leads one point-zero.

712
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,144
If Alex doesn't beat Yau-Man's

713
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,186
mark, Earl won't have to go in

714
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,731
this round, either.

715
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,288
Alex ricochets off two targets,

716
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,414
doesn't hit either one.

717
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,749
Moto wins the second round.

718
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,381
Moving on to the last round, bow

719
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,717
and arrow.

720
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,469
Here's where we stand.

721
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,304
Moto leads three-zip.

722
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,430
This round is worth three

723
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,598
points.

724
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,849
If Ravu wins this round and we

725
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,850
are tied, we will go to sudden

726
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,768
death.

727
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,685
Sudden death will be with the

728
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,520
bow and arrow, one shooter, one

729
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:27,896
arrow, one winner.

730
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,107
Ravu, you're up.

731
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,777
Lisi not on the board for Ravu.

732
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,113
Moto.

733
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,740
Stacy wide to the right.

734
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,911
Ravu, you're up.

735
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,954
Mookie would like to set a nice,

736
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,000
tough mark for Moto to beat.

737
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:50,794
And he does not.

738
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,879
The target is still wide open.

739
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,256
Moto.

740
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,551
>> Yeah!

741
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,552
>> PROBST: Michelle just barely

742
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,512
on the target.

743
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,598
Ravu, you're up.

744
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,101
Ravu now has the mark to beat.

745
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,437
Boo up for Moto.

746
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,772
Ravu still in the lead.

747
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,233
Alex up for Ravu.

748
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,405
That won't cut it.

749
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,824
>> Oh!

750
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,203
>> PROBST: Yau-Man.

751
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,663
What kind of move will he have

752
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,373
with the bow and arrow?

753
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,541
Yau-Man, what are you possibly

754
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,834
looking for?

755
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,877
>> The straightest possible

756
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,878
arrow.

757
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,965
>> Come on, Yau!

758
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,844
>> PROBST: Yau-Man once again

759
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,388
brings his own style.

760
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,397
Yau-Man takes the lead for Moto.

761
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,904
It comes down to Edgardo for

762
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,864
Ravu.

763
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,366
Ravu needs to win this round to

764
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,826
force a tie.

765
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,744
Otherwise Moto wins immunity,

766
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,787
and Earl will not have to

767
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,247
participate in this challenge at

768
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,999
all.

769
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,485
>> PROBST: Moto wins immunity!

770
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,782
Moto, congratulations.

771
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,909
The new Moto tribe has not lost

772
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,411
immunity.

773
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:50,872
Ravu, once again, you have a

774
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,916
date with me at tribal council.

775
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,000
One of the five of you going

776
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,084
home.

777
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,044
Grab your stuff, head back to

778
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,505
camp.

779
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,917
>> How do we do so horrible?

780
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,169
We did bad.

781
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:41,923
>> I'm done with the losers.

782
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:42,882
These guys can't pull it

783
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,009
together.

784
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,053
Can I just say loser?

785
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,223
Loo-oo-ser.

786
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,016
I'm surrounded by losers.

787
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,142
You know what's going on?

788
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,102
That they know that they suck.

789
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,019
And when you know you suck, you

790
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:55,937
suck.

791
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,021
Dude, I'm telling you, this

792
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,898
whole tribe is a sinking ship.

793
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:03,319
There was no reason for you guys

794
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,862
to lose today.

795
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,906
Quite frankly, I don't see you

796
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,907
guys winning the next reward

797
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,201
challenge, and that means I get

798
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,661
to go to Exile Island again.

799
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,745
I'm not trying to buy real

800
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,621
estate, dude, you know what I'm

801
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,914
saying?

802
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,999
>> I understand.

803
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,125
>> I just really feel like my

804
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,835
time is up, and before I drive

805
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,460
myself crazy, I'd rather just

806
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,045
let you guys know how I'm

807
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,964
feeling, you know?

808
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,174
>> I just don't understand.

809
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,597
>> Lisi decided today that she

810
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,222
wants to be the next one to go.

811
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,308
She says she's had the

812
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,767
experience she wants to have,

813
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,060
and is grateful that Ed and I

814
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,478
kept her safe for as long as we

815
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,104
did, and it's just done, so she

816
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,190
told us she wants to go next.

817
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,900
>> I don't know what went awry,

818
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,068
you know?

819
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,320
>> I ran the gamut in this game,

820
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,529
I've been rich, I've been poor,

821
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,113
I've been in exile.

822
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,157
What more have I got to do?

823
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,159
I'm going to cry.

824
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:51,993
Oh!

825
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,287
>> The fact that Lisi wants to

826
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,830
quit pissed me off because I

827
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,707
could probably use her in the

828
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,916
future, because she's a solid

829
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,335
vote, but hey, I try not to

830
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,794
judge people in life.

831
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,338
I'm not going to judge Lisi now.

832
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,589
>> I knew if I talked to you

833
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,882
guys, you guys probably wouldn't

834
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,133
have voted me off, you know?

835
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,968
And that to me is like... I

836
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,219
don't know.

837
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,638
It's amazing.

838
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,972
It's amazing, and it's something

839
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,973
that's going to be treasured

840
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:14,182
forever.

841
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,183
We're going to be friends, end

842
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,352
of story, no more crying.

843
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,478
Sometimes you have to know when

844
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,646
it's time to go.

845
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,022
And I just kind of feel like

846
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,523
it's the end of the game for me.

847
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,400
I've gotten further than I ever

848
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,860
thought I would get, and I just

849
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,487
don't see the need to push

850
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,029
myself any further.

851
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,740
I'm done like a Thanksgiving day

852
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,283
turkey, man-- I'm done.

853
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,344
But it's cool, it's cool.

854
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,387
Well, we have tribal council

855
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,805
tonight, and pretty much, Lisi's

856
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,013
gone.

857
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,474
She's just laying there like

858
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,684
she's a sad puppy, so it's time

859
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,185
for her to go.

860
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,604
Getting rid of her is a dream

861
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,188
come true for me.

862
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,231
I don't know how the rest of the

863
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,190
boys feel about it, but I'm so

864
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,149
happy.

865
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,109
At tribal council, I might not

866
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,819
even be paying attention,

867
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:08,611
Jeff will be talking, and I'll

868
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,445
just get up and start taking

869
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,489
votes myself.

870
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,417
>> Going into tribal council,

871
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,042
I'm not going to take my bags.

872
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,043
I'm just going to tribal council

873
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,086
because I got plans on coming

874
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:30,258
back.

875
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,344
>> What would happen if we kept

876
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:38,474
on going?

877
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,309
>> I don't know.

878
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,811
What do you want me to say?

879
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,104
>> Look, I'm just thinking a

880
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,605
little bit more, that's all.

881
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,023
I'm having second thoughts.

882
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,358
All I can say is I was sitting

883
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,110
here thinking, and I was

884
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,486
thinking some more, and that's

885
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,863
why I pulled you guys over.

886
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:52,947
>> Okay, Lisi changed her mind

887
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,197
again.

888
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,408
I mean, she's gone back and

889
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,451
forth, like, three times.

890
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,952
So, I mean, I throw my hands up

891
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:58,536
in despair as if to say, "What

892
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,122
the hell?"

893
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,290
>> Okay, I'm looking at all

894
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,166
options.

895
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:03,666
Help me out here, guys.

896
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,167
Hello!

897
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,544
Alex and Edgardo, they know me.

898
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,463
The three of us are probably the

899
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,505
tightest three people in this

900
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,631
game.

901
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,216
And we've all had moments where

902
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,010
we've been at the brink, and

903
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,845
then something has pushed us

904
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,221
away or... but we've just kept

905
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,432
on playing.

906
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,281
>> Tonight we have to go to

907
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,240
tribal council and vote somebody

908
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,159
out.

909
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,202
So I mean, is it Lisi or Dreamz?

910
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,120
We haven't decided who's going

911
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,246
to be the target.

912
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,206
And that worries me a little

913
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:43,831
bit, but, I mean, you have to do

914
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,333
what you have to do.

915
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,754
>> In my eyes, Dreamz should be

916
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,255
the next one to go tonight.

917
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,382
I would vote for him, Alex would

918
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,634
vote for him, Edgardo would vote

919
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,760
for him.

920
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,928
So that's three votes.

921
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,554
Mookie's going to vote for me,

922
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,514
and Dreamz will vote for me as

923
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,515
well.

924
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,557
So Dreamz is going to end up

925
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,226
coming out of this.

926
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,748
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

927
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,291
the first member of our jury.

928
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:30,545
Rocky, voted out at the last

929
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,090
tribal council.

930
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,925
I'll remind you, the jury is

931
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:36,551
here merely to observe, listen

932
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,427
in, gather information to help

933
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,931
make a very big decision.

934
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,432
Since this new tribe formed,

935
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,684
you've lost four out of five

936
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,726
challenges.

937
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,769
Lisi, what's missing in this

938
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,020
tribe?

939
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,689
>> Well, there seems to be a lot

940
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,149
of individualism happening here.

941
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,818
The group cannot come together

942
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,443
as a cohesive force, and that's

943
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,655
how you see the other tribe

944
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,073
winning.

945
00:35:59,156 --> 00:35:59,574
>> PROBST: You've had an

946
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,200
emotional ride.

947
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:01,742
>> Yeah, you could say that

948
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,201
again.

949
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,287
I mean, I've run the gamut in

950
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,246
this game.

951
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,372
I've been rich, I've been poor,

952
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,207
I've been in exile.

953
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,876
I've been all over the board.

954
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,211
So yeah, I've played this game.

955
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,046
There's no question about that.

956
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,923
>> PROBST: Dreamz, what are you

957
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,300
basing your vote on tonight?

958
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,843
>> You want me to be honest?

959
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,177
I think Lisi wants to go home

960
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,304
because she's not winning like

961
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,597
she was at the old Moto.

962
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,056
She gives up easily.

963
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,641
It's not hard to see that, Jeff.

964
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,726
>> I've seen you give up in the

965
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,060
middle of a challenge.

966
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,437
>> You've never see me give up.

967
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,354
>> Okay.

968
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:30,980
>> In your life you'll never see

969
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:31,314
me give up.

970
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,149
I can't give up.

971
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,108
It's not in me.

972
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,067
It can't be in me.

973
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:35,985
>> I've seen you not pull

974
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,153
through when it was time to,

975
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,070
like, pull through, like to

976
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:38,946
bring out the stuff from

977
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,697
underneath you.

978
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,531
>> When?

979
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,490
>> I saw you... okay, I can't

980
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,366
even do this, man.

981
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,243
>> Like I said, Jeff, I think

982
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,704
she wants to go home, and they

983
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,247
call me a genie in the bottle,

984
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,790
because I grant wishes.

985
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,627
>> PROBST: So Lisi, what is the

986
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,420
status of your will, your

987
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,880
desire?

988
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,007
>> It's, quite frankly, wavering

989
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,342
from minute to minute.

990
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,677
Sometimes I feel like there's

991
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,262
hope and sometimes I feel like

992
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,515
we're doomed.

993
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,643
>> PROBST: Edgardo, how do you

994
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,311
go and trust somebody who's been

995
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,647
so vocal about their uncertainty

996
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,439
in this game?

997
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,942
>> Well, based on the talks that

998
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,234
I have with Lisi, Lisi and I

999
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:17,860
don't have anything to hide from

1000
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,278
each other.

1001
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,571
She's told me everything.

1002
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,948
I mean, winning a lot, then

1003
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:22,949
losing a lot, then being on

1004
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:23,532
Exile Island has affected the

1005
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,243
way she's viewing the game.

1006
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,703
>> PROBST: Dreamz, yes or no,

1007
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,081
has your will dipped?

1008
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,082
>> I'm glad you asked that.

1009
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:31,707
My will is so opposite of hers.

1010
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,458
Because I will fight.

1011
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,459
You get what I'm saying, Jeff?

1012
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,670
If I die, resuscitate me at the

1013
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,921
finish line, you know what I

1014
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:37,922
mean?

1015
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,090
The warriors that I fight with,

1016
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,675
we don't think we lose because

1017
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,093
we suck.

1018
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,302
So our spirit don't go down.

1019
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,720
Her spirit goes down.

1020
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,847
>> PROBST: So, Lisi, do you want

1021
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,015
to be here?

1022
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,475
>> Can't I catch a break?

1023
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,144
I mean, there are times where

1024
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,771
you're just not up to it.

1025
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,355
I'm just being honest.

1026
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,816
>> Well, I'm sorry, Jeff, I

1027
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,067
really didn't get the answer to

1028
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,693
that question, do she want to be

1029
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,527
here.

1030
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,404
She kind of moved around it, and

1031
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,863
I didn't understand it at all.

1032
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,365
Can you ask her again?

1033
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,616
>> PROBST: You just did.

1034
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,579
>> What?

1035
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,706
>> Do you want to be here?

1036
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,623
>> Okay...

1037
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,291
>> It's a yes or no question,

1038
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,167
Lis.

1039
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:15,918
Do you want to be here, Alex?

1040
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:16,711
>> Yes.

1041
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,461
>> Do you want to be here,

1042
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:17,712
Edgardo?

1043
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,171
>> You know it.

1044
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:19,922
>> Do you want to be here,

1045
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,631
Mookie?

1046
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,215
See how simple their answers

1047
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,174
were?

1048
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:22,883
>> Okay, that's fine.

1049
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,718
>> They didn't give me a

1050
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,677
shalingua... shiquare...

1051
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,511
>> PROBST: Soliloquy?

1052
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,470
>> Yeah.

1053
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,346
They didn't give me one of

1054
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,347
those.

1055
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,348
>> All right, so I'm at fault

1056
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,391
for being honest and saying

1057
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,475
I have to think for a minute, I

1058
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,601
have to just chill?

1059
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,812
>> Jeff, I'm ready to vote.

1060
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,566
>> PROBST: So Lisi, because we

1061
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,151
have a vote about to happen,

1062
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,318
what would you advise your tribe

1063
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:41,569
to do?

1064
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,779
>> Just give me a chance.

1065
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,115
I mean, Edgardo and Alex know

1066
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:46,532
me.

1067
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,492
Dreamz, whether he wants to

1068
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,493
admit that he knows me or not is

1069
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,370
another story.

1070
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:51,746
>> It's not that.

1071
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,205
>> He's seen me around.

1072
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,040
Okay, now I'm talking, okay, now

1073
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,457
I'm talking!

1074
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,834
So, you know, he's seen me

1075
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,877
around, and he can judge my

1076
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,128
actions, what have you.

1077
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,047
Just give me a chance.

1078
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,385
Just let me see what happens.

1079
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,511
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to

1080
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:07,762
the vote.

1081
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,681
If anybody has the hidden

1082
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,766
immunity idol and you want to

1083
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,808
play it, you would present it to

1084
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,060
me before I read the votes.

1085
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,728
It is time to vote.

1086
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,147
Mookie, you're up.

1087
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,574
>> I've been waiting to do this

1088
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,911
for a long time.

1089
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,754
>> You're a grown man.

1090
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,465
Consider a name change.

1091
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,815
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1092
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,234
votes.

1093
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,162
If anybody has the hidden

1094
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,205
immunity idol and you want to

1095
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,206
play it, now would be the time

1096
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:22,628
to do so.

1097
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,754
Okay, once the votes are read,

1098
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,797
the decision is final.

1099
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,673
The person voted out will be

1100
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,841
asked to leave the tribal

1101
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,008
council area immediately.

1102
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,094
I'll read the votes.

1103
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,763
First vote, Lisi.

1104
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,186
Dreamz.

1105
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,646
One vote Lisi, one vote Dreamz.

1106
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,401
Lisi.

1107
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,736
Two votes Lisi, one vote Dreamz.

1108
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,949
Eighth person voted out, and the

1109
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,409
second member of our jury, Lisi.

1110
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,577
You need to bring me your torch.

1111
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,590
Lisi, the tribe has spoken.

1112
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,554
It's time for you to go.

1113
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,147
Well, if there is one truth in

1114
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,857
this game, it is you have to

1115
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,692
want to win in order to make it

1116
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:27,985
to the end.

1117
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,403
Obviously you didn't feel Lisi

1118
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:29,778
had that desire.

1119
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,822
Good news is the four of you

1120
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,240
remaining all say that you do.

1121
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,325
Grab your torches.

1122
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,201
Head back to camp.

1123
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,036
Good night.

1124

00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,186
belongings and paddle to Exile

1131
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,646
Island immediately."

1132
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,855
>> PROBST: ...shakes things up.

1133
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,357
>> We've living on Exile Island?

1134
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,274
>> PROBST: And a shocking twist

1135
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:07,691
changes everything.

1136
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,902
>> Oh, my god!

1137
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,278
>> What the hell?

1138
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:11,779
>> This is so messed up!

1139
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,572
>> Oh, my god.

1140
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,823
We're going to die.

1141
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,248
>> You can sit there and say

1142
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,707
whatever, but I know who I am.

1143
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,918
It's not a matter of will.

1144
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,461
When the ship is sinking, you

1145
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:27,836
get off the ship.

1146
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,630
Another thing, Ravu, you guys

1147
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,965
are never going to get it

1148
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,007
together.

1149
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,300
You guys are losers, over and

1150
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,469
over and over again.

1151
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:36,011
There's nothing I could say,

1152
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:36,595
other than try to hold on to

1153
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,596
yourselves, because together

1154
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,807
you're nothing.
