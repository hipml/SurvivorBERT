<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,546
After Tribal Council, Sally was

4
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:05,588
the last woman standing at

5
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,383
La Mina.

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,968
>> Ruth Marie ended up getting

7
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,928
the votes and was sent home.

8
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,888
And I am telling you, I have

9
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,306
never felt so good in my whole

10
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,349
life.

11
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,392
>> PROBST: At the reward

12
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,059
challenge, the tribes competed

13
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,561
for food and wine.

14
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,562
>> Oh, my God.

15
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,688
>> PROBST: La Mina took the

16
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,689
lead.

17
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,690
Terry with a nice grab.

18
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,483
Bruce really having trouble.

19
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,109
But Sally struggled, and Bobby

20
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,278
chopped his way to victory for

21
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,237
Casaya.

22
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,448
Casaya wins reward!

23
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,907
>> Tonight we eat!

24
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,450
>> PROBST: Casaya won fresh

25
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,995
fish, rice, beans, spices and

26
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,289
wine, while La Mina was left

27
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,790
with only a bag of beans, and

28
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,459
had their leader sent, once

29
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,085
again, to Exile Island.

30
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,212
>> Good luck, Terry.

31
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:46,629
(thunder crashing)

32
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,173
>> PROBST: Casaya returned to

33
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,175
find their camp underwater.

34
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,217
>> This is a nightmare.

35
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,927
>> We have a top of fish, but

36
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,053
we can't cook it.

37
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,263
Everything is wet.

38
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,515
>> PROBST: But even without

39
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,683
fire, they managed to make the

40
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,142
most of their reward.

41
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,186
>> I've never eaten raw fish.

42
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,480
I hope I don't wake up in the

43
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,731
morning with some kind of

44
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,274
sickness or something.

45
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,818
>> PROBST: At La Mina, the

46
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,319
tribe devoured their first

47
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,489
nourishment in days...

48
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,198
but the beans were too much

49
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,284
for Nick and Austin's stomachs.

50
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,911
>> Well, I got to go again.

51
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,330
>> That stuff just wrecked me.

52
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,498
>> PROBST: Back at Casaya,

53
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,791
Bobby and Bruce spent some

54
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:30,548
quality time in the outhouse.

55
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,008
>> Excuse me.

56
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,134
>> PROBST: And in the morning,

57
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:33,551
they paid the price.

58
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,344
>> What happened to that last

59
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,429
bottle of wine?

60
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,182
>> Someone would have to pour

61
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,350
it down my throat for me to

62
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,476
drink the last bottle of wine

63
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,102
that we, as a tribe, won.

64
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,437
>> You really made a bad, bad

65
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,438
call.

66
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,648
>> I don't feel bad that I

67
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,023
stole your wine.

68
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,149
Like, I feel bad that I deprived

69
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,526
them of wine, but I have no hard

70
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,401
feelings, whatsoever, about the

71
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,319
fact that you've been deprived

72
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,654
of wine.

73
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,613
>> PROBST: At the immunity

74
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,739
challenge...

75
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,199
La Mina with a big lead!

76
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,784
...La Mina finally broke their

77
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,368
losing streak.

78
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,994
>> That's it!

79
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,995
>> PROBST: La Mina has it.

80
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,914
La Mina wins immunity!

81
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,749
Back at Casaya, the alliance of

82
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,252
Shane, Aras, Courtney and

83
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,212
Danielle made their decision.

84
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,713
>> No other discussion.

85
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,673
Bobby goes down on the carpet.

86
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,465
>> PROBST: But Aras changed the

87
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,383
plan.

88
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,510
>> We cannot control Bruce.

89
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,763
>> This is really stupid, but

90
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,973
all right.

91
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,099
>> PROBST: Then Danielle

92
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,308
changed the plan again.

93
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,102
>> Keep Bruce.

94
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,186
I'm telling you, it's a better

95
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,313
decision for all of us.

96
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,356
>> PROBST: And Shane was

97
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,566
irritated with his tribe's

98
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,817
flip-flopping.

99
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,110
>> Why didn't you tell me that

100
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,736
an hour ago, Courtney?

101
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,904
I told everybody, initially,

102
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,488
that Bobby should go, and then

103
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,407
they freaked out and said

104
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,783
nothing-- they're like women.

105
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,118
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

106
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,579
the voting was erratic.

107
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,371
But three votes were enough to

108
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,415
make Bobby the fifth person

109
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,208
voted out of the game.

110
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:52,171
Bobby, the tribe has spoken.

111
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,756
11 are left.

112
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:05,351
Who will be voted out tonight?

113
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,438

tomorrow?

127

00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,511
getting into a huge fight with

129
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,470
you.

130
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,180

unless you guys allow me to

take my son's name back, so...

right decisions.

140
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,485
I'd rather go into the merge

141
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,448
a lone wolf than have to deal

142

this anger towards me and you're

going to start bashing me now,

147

because you're going to go

through one of your manic,

149
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,585
crazy spasms.

150
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,628
I don't need to deal with it.

151
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,880
I don't want to deal with it.

00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,756
I'm going to bed.

tomorrow, then bring it up

155
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,259
tomorrow and we'll argue

156
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,094
tomorrow, okay?

157
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,721
Because I just... I don't need

sleep on the beach last night,

168
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,834
so I had to catch Courtney up...

169
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,211
(laughing)

170
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,672

171
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,673
leave their alliance.

172
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,217
You know, she has to know.

(laughing)

174
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,471
Um, so Courtney decided, well,

175
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,266
let's get rid of Shane.

176
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,976
"Wouldn't that be amazing?" is

177
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,685
what she said.

178
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,187
I'm like, "Oh, okay. Huh."

179
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,773
(laughing)

180
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,203

181
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,290
(laughing quietly)

182
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,918
Last night, we get back to the

183
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,337
shelter, and Shane has one of

184
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,340
his crazy, manic, psycho fits

185
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,093
again, and he's next.

186
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,136
That's the bottom line.

187
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,304
He's such an idiot.

188
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,305
I can't stand him.

189
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,306
>> Yeah.

190
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,307
>> He's such a moron.

191
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,600
I cannot wait to vote him off.

192
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,101
>> He's so getting what he

193
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,103
deserves.

194
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,022
>> He's just a lunatic.

195
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,565
He's lost his mind.

196
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,400
He's just a freak.

197
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,776
(whispering): "I want out of

198
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,403
the alliance with you and

199
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,030
Courtney."

200
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,323
And then he's saying that he

201
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,616
wants nothing to do with me and

202
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,075
Courtney.

203
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,452
You know, "I want out.

204
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,411
You guys are disorganized.

205
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,913
I don't like the way the Tribal

206
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,955
Council went down."

207
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,123
Well, if that's how you feel

208
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,124
about it, then fine.

209
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,125
Get out of the alliance.

210
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,585
You're off anyway, who cares?

211
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,503
See you later.

212
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:24,670
Bye.

213
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,256
>> This is so on the down-low.

214
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,091
It's going to be a stealth

215
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,930
chop the head off, guillotine

216
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:50,571
style.

217
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,115
>> It's beautiful out here.

218
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,116
Another beautiful day in

219
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,117
paradise.

220
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,328
I'm taking a quiet moment to

221
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:06,087
enjoy it.

222
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,421
I've been within 200 miles of

223
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,674
this spot many times,

224
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:14,720
vertically.

225
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,430
Good morning.

226
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,014
>> I feel really groggy today.

227
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,724
>> I'm going to get the fire

228
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,059
on, and then we'll warm up the

229
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,603
beans.

230
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,481
>> They taste a little better.

231
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,065
>> It's been a rough couple of

232
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:26,774
days.

233
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,818
The four guys are kind of

234
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,111
doing, like, a boys' club thing.

235
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,072
But I think it's shortsighted.

236
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,865
These guys think that they know

237
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,367
how the game works, but, like,

238
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,244
I'd be very surprised if the

239
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,288
all-man's club ended up lasting

240
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,125
as long as they think it would.

241
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:44,959
>> These are little minnows.

242
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,127
They're caught in this pond

243
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,128
here.

244
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,129
They're tiny, tiny, but they're

245
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,630
salty.

246
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,923
They're better than nothing.

247
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,262
They are protein.

248
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,305
>> I've been fantasizing about

249
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,514
food since day two.

250
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,640
I can't stop, no matter what I

251
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,725
do.

252
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,726
If we could get some food in

253
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,102
our stomachs, this whole game

254
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,103
could change.

255
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,396
You'd think I was diving for

256
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,481
friggin' chicken nuggets down

257
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,482
here.

258
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,693
I... got one.

259
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,363
Don't you move.

260
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,660
Food.

261
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,746
He's going down the hatch.

262
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,875
Boy, did he taste awful.

263
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,169
Ugh!

264
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,051
>> Hey, Nick.

265
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
>> Yeah?

266
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,571
As in?

267
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:56,530
>> While they were flying.

268
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,156
>> As in when they were flying?

269
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,866
You've got to be kidding me?

270
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,075
>> Yeah.

271
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,661
Three space shuttle flights, uh,

272
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,704
once aboard the shuttle

273
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,415
<i>Endeavor,</i> twice aboard shuttle

274
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,958
<i>Discovery.</i>

275
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,085
>> Oh, my God.

276
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,711
>> It's a dream come true, what

277
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,254
I wanted to do my whole life.

278
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,798
>> Dan, that's unbelievable.

279
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,257
I never thought I'd even meet

280
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:15,841
an astronaut, never mind live

281
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,801
with one.

282
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,969
I mean, the guy has looked at

283
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,970
Earth from space.

284
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,722
So he's, he's an incredible guy,

285
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,307
and I knew that from the start.

286
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,059
To learn that and how humble he

287
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,727
is about, um, being an astronaut

288
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,770
is... is pretty amazing.

289
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,813
>> You wouldn't believe how many

290
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,107
people told me I could never be

291
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,149
an astronaut.

292
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:32,942
I've been to orbit three times,

293
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,944
on space shuttles, I've done

294
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,237
four space walks, I've been to

295
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,904
space station twice.

296
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,198
>> Man, I need to come up with

297
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:39,865
something, 'cause I got nothing.

298
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,159
>> Hey, Nick, you and I, we got

299
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,369
nothing time, though, baby.

300
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,370
>> That's true.

301
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,371
>> Man, that's awesome though,

302
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,372
dude.

303
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,373
He actually has dined with Neil

304
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,416
Armstrong.

305
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:48,833
Dan Flago is a stud.

306
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,835
I told you from the get-go.

307
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,836
He's a pimp.

308
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,837
>> You know what, it wasn't

309
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,838
like hiding anything from you.

310
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,839
It was because I didn't want to

311
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,840
be, you know, the "astronaut"

312
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,841
guy.

313
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,842
I just wanted to be Dan.

314
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:58,843
We've become really good

315
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,844
friends, and I don't want to

316
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,845
keep the secret from them

317
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,846
anymore.

318
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,347
This is just another way for us

319
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,641
to... to bond.

320
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,351
>> I guess I need to come clean.

321
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,727
My real name is John Grisham.

322
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:32,585
>> I was going to say, yeah.

323
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,671
>> Sunshine again.

324
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,010
So happy.

325
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,147
>> Usually, in a normal

326
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,274
alliance, we could say, "Listen,

327
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,443
I just want to be out of this."

328
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,986
But I can't really do that

329
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,820
because I... I swore on my kid's

330
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,156
life that I'd stay with you

331
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,157
guys.

332
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,158
>> What, what, why are you so

333
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,159
upset?

334
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,035
>> I'm not.

335
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,036
Listen, I don't, I don't want to

336
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,037
talk about that.

337
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,038
I want to really, I want to ask

338
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,039
you guys if I can take my son's

339
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,040
name...

340
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,041
>> Done.

341
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,751
>> Done? Courtney?

342
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,293
>> I don't, you're, you're

343
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,836
making a mistake right now.

344
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,629
I don't see...

345
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,671
>> I'm not making a mistake.

346
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,881
I'm never gonna ever be beholden

347
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,424
to people that make decisions

348
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,967
based on personal feelings.

349
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,595
You guys voted Bobby out of

350
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,596
here because you, Bobby pissed

351
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,597
you off five days ago.

352
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,598
>> Negative.

353
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,599
>> No.

354
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,600
>> Okay.

355
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,601
>> I stuck to the original plan,

356
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,227
so if you want to get angry at

357
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,019
someone for flipping, then you

358
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,020
should get angry at me.

359
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,021
>> I did.

360
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,022
I got angry at Courtney.

361
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,023
I told... I got angry at

362
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,024
Courtney, got angry at...

363
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,025
>> You lashed out at me last

364
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,026
night.

365
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,027
>> Like, all you're doing is

366
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,028
lashing out at people.

367
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,905
>> Oh, all I do is lash out at

368
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,906
everyone.

369
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,907
>> You do.

370
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,908
>> It's terrible, awful.

371
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,034
>> You guys do nothing.

372
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,787
You guys do nothing.

373
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,622
>> Honestly, you have these,

374
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,207
like, outbreaks, and you just

375
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,750
lash out at whoever is next to

376
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,001
you.

377
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,545
And I'm sick of it, so don't...

378
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,505
I don't want to hear it.

379
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,965
Don't lash out at me again.

380
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:01,340
I don't need it.

381
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,758
Honestly.

382
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,176
I'm not here for that.

383
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,719
I came here to enjoy myself, not

384
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,765
to have people demean me.

385
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,102
>> I second that motion.

386
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,354
>> I haven't lashed out at you

387
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,605
in days.

388
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,022
>> You were horribly

389
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,441
disrespectful to me yesterday.

390
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,067
What are you mumbling about

391
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,694
over there?

392
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:21,986
I mean...

393
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,071
>> You don't even realize...

394
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,114
>> You don't even realize how

395
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:25,990
mean you are.

396
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,825
>> You just talk so down to

397
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,784
people, like...

398
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,368
>> It's funny how you two are

399
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,078
the only two that have a problem

400
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,079
with it.

401
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,455
>> We're the only ones who need

402
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,081
to say anything about it.

403
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,417
>> I'm done.

404
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,418
>> You done?

405
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,419
>> Set aside, it's done.

406
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,420
>> I need to get out of this

407
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,296
alliance, because I'm in it

408
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,630
with an idiot, and I don't want

409
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,632
to be with Shane.

410
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,092
I just don't.

411
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,343
I don't, I don't trust that he's

412
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,219
going to keep his mouth shut.

413
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,345
I don't respect the way he

414
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,346
treats other people.

415
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,347
And I don't want to be a part

416
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,390
of that.

417
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,725
If I have a choice, I don't want

418
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,642
to be a part of it.

419
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,852
So truth be told, I think it's

420
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,477
great the alliance is broken up

421
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,022
because it's a paper tiger.

422
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,356
There's no power to this

423
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,442
alliance anymore.

424
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,829
>> I don't like Courtney,

425
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:17,875
either.

426
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,167
But I did.

427
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,127
I screwed myself bad.

428
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,795
>> I feel like Shane just wrote

429
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,006
his walking papers, basically.

430
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,382
And unless he somehow is able

431
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,884
to apologize to the girls, say,

432
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,927
"Look, I didn't really mean it,"

433
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,804
I feel like that guy is going to

434
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:38,270
go home.

435
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,230
(screeches)

436
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,662
>> Ooh!

437
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,038
That's scary.

438
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,207
>> Simple.

439
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,542
>> That looks freaky.

440
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,835
That doesn't look like a fun,

441
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,211
like, trivia game.

442
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,880
>> Terry, we got tree mail.

443
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:05,964
>> Tree mail.

444
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:06,548
>> All righty, bring it on.

445
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,217
>> "With strength and smarts

446
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,134
today, we'll see, how hard

447
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,553
you'll compete for immunity."

448
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,388
>> Another immunity?

449
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,722
>> No, this one's huge.

450
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,932
>> Wow!

451
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,100
>> "The winners get away for a

452
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,101
treat you'll dig."

453
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,102
>> Oh, my God!

454
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,103
>> We have got to win.

455
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,104
>> "Today the stakes are high

456
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,440
and the reward is big."

457
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,566
>> Oh!

458
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,567
Oh, God!

459
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,568
>> Wow!

460
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,611
>> This is the sweetest thing

461
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,278
I've ever heard.

462
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,029
>> Immunity and reward.

463
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:29,863
>> That's awesome!

464
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,031
>> This could be immunity.

465
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,449
Immunity.

466
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,784
Let's, let's, let's pare the

467
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,785
numbers down today, you guys.

468
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,786
>> I'll die if we don't win

469
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,995
this.

470
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:37,996
>> We're gonna win it.

471
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,956
>> It is absolutely vital that

472
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,958
we play to win today.

473
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:41,417
We need to win this.

474
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,585
We need to be able to get the

475
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,128
numbers even before, for it

476
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,380
potentially go into a merge.

477
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,381
>> I'm not going home tonight,

478
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,382
you guys.

479
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,383
>> Let's get it done today,

480
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,384
guys; let's get it done.

481
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,093
>> One, two, three, La Mina!

482
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,094
>> Come on, baby.

483
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,888
>> If we win, five on five.

484
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,389
>> Strength and smarts.

485
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,599
>> If we lose, Sally most likely

486
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,601
will be gone and we're gonna be

487
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,602
hurting big time.

488
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,270
So, uh, we're totally stoked.

489
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,313
This, this is, this is game

490
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:13,532
seven of the World Series.

491
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:20,205
>> PROBST: La Mina, come on in!

492
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,458
Casaya, come on in.

493
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,667
La Mina, getting your first

494
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,169
look at the new Casaya.

495
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,671
Bobby voted out at the last

496
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,964
Tribal Council.

497
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,050
>> Wow!

498
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,471
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

499
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,472
to today's challenge?

500
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,473
>> Better believe it.

501
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,474
>> You bet.

502
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,475
>> Yeah.

503
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,225
>> PROBST: First things first.

504
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,268
Nick.

505
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:45,773
Thank you.

506
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,483
Once again, immunity is back up

507
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,359
for grabs because today's

508
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,153
challenge is for both reward

509
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,238
and immunity.

510
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,573
Here's how it works.

511
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,199
On my "go," three members from

512
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,076
each tribe will race out to the

513
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,286
field to collect puzzle pieces.

514
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,705
You'll go one at a time.

515
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,290
You'll untie it, lower it,

516
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,543
unhook it, bring it back.

517
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,587
Once you have all four pieces,

518
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,756
the two remaining tribe members

519
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,591
will use those pieces to solve

520
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,510
a spinning puzzle.

521
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,552
First tribe to solve it

522
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,512
correctly wins reward.

523
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,513
Want to know what you're

524
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,514
playing for?

525
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,515
>> Yeah.

526
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,516
>> Definitely.

527
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,517
>> PROBST: Everything you need

528
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,851
to have a good afternoon and a

529
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,268
good, old barbecue.

530
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,814
>> Oh, yeah!

531
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,981
>> PROBST: Including some toys

532
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,650
you're going to bring for the

533
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,026
children of a local Panamanian

534
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,070
village that will be your host.

535
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:33,612
You will have a Panamanian

536
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,572
barbecue: barbecued chicken,

537
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,283
barbecued beef, wine, beer,

538
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,702
soft drinks, the works.

539
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,870
And that's not all.

540
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,997
While the winners are partying,

541
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,582
the losers will be at Tribal

542
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,501
Council tonight, where somebody

543
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,461
will be voted out.

544
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,337
And as always, the winning

545
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,339
tribe gets to choose one member

546
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,883
from the losing tribe to send

547
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,051
to Exile Island.

548
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,386
The difference is, this time,

549
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,680
the person you send to Exile

550
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,473
Island will not go to Tribal

551
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,559
Council tonight.

552
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,435
That means they cannot be voted

553
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,062
out.

554
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,272
So instead of punishing

555
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,648
somebody, you are protecting

556
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,066
somebody.

557
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,067
Big stakes at this point in the

558
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,068
game.

559
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,069
Worth playing for?

560
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,070
(all agreeing)

561
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,071
>> PROBST: Casaya, you have one

562
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,072
extra member.

563
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,073
You're sitting somebody out.

564
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:18,866
Who is it gonna be?

565
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:19,700
>> Courtney is gonna sit out.

566
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,492
>> PROBST: Courtney will sit

567
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,493
out.

568
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,494

00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,845
feast, immunity, power over

760
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,555
who goes to Exile Island.

761
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,015
Casaya right on the edge of the

762
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,641
last piece, if they can get it

763
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,727
to fit.

764
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,271
La Mina still working.

765
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,022
>> Step on it. Step on it.

766
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,024
>> PROBST: Casaya wins reward

767
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,734
and immunity!

768
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,905
(Casaya tribe cheering)

769
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,825
>> You did it, Bruce!

770
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,248
>> PROBST: Casaya, huge win.

771
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:18,999
>> Bruce, you hold that,

772
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,251
brother.

773
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,461
>> Good job, Bruce.

774
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,045
>> PROBST: Immunity keeps you

775
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,839
safe from Tribal Council

776
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,965
tonight, and you have a big

777
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,508
decision to make.

778
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,885
You're going to send one person

779
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,552
to Exile Island right now; that

780
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,054
person cannot be voted out

781
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,681
tonight.

782
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,143
(Casaya tribe whispering)

783
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,521
Casaya, who's it gonna be?

784
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,607
>> Sally.

785
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,317
>> PROBST: Sally, going to Exile

786
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,651
Island.

787
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,570
Boat's waiting.

788
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,197
>> See you guys. Good job.

789
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,989
>> PROBST: Keep in mind, Sally

790
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,365
will get another clue to the

791
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,700
whereabouts of the hidden

792
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,327
immunity idol.

793
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,161
Whether or not somebody's

794
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,997
already found it, who knows?

795
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,707
La Mina, all I have for you is a

796
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,958
date tonight with me at Tribal

797
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,377
Council.

798
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,378
Somebody going home.

799
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,379
Grab your stuff, head on back to

800
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,380
camp.

801
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,757
See you at Tribal.

802
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,593
Casaya, it's time to party.

803
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,386
Have a good time.

804
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,680
Boat's waiting for you.

805
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:36,660
>> Exile Island, for me, is my

806
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,744
saving grace.

807
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,080
In every other case, the

808
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,790
negative downside has been to be

809
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,791
away from the tribe.

810
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,461
In this case, me being here

811
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,796
today is a good thing, because I

812
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,673
felt like there was a pretty

813
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,674
strong alliance between the four

814
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,967
guys and that I would be the one

815
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,968
to go.

816
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,219
So it put things in a really

817
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:54,803
different perspective.

818
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,847
Today, it's actually saving me.

819
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,769
>> "Clue number six: It is not

820
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,521
found here, but it is in the

821
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,940
shade for most of the day."

822
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,024
It's so important that I'm here

823
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,276
right now and that I have this

824
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:09,693
opportunity.

825
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,777
Assuming I don't get dumped on

826
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,654
for the next couple of days,

827
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,281
this is a gift to be here,

828
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,532
so I'm thrilled.

829
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,116
It's like a little vacation,

830
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,076
some girl time, get away from

831
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,246
all those boys for a while.

832
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,421
It's exciting and frustrating to

833
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,005
think that there's an immunity

834
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:30,839
idol out here somewhere,

835
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,882
but it's overwhelming.

836
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,092
You really don't know where to

837
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,719
start.

838
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,679
I'm safe tonight and I'm going

839
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,223
to wake up tomorrow safe.

840
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:40,849
I'm just privileged and giddy to

841
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,727
still be here, so...

842
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,437
Even it's on Exile Island by

843
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,940
myself.

844
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,994
(children laughing, shrieking)

845
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,767
>> We had won the reward

846
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,893
challenge.

847
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,395
La Mina is demoralized.

848
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,480
We knew they were going to

849
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,065
Tribal Council tonight.

850
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,107
We're in the middle of this

851
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,901
Panamanian fishing village.

852
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,779
We knew we were going to eat.

853
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,448
I'm just so, so happy to be here

854
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,408
right now.

855
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,660
>> I'm coming, I'm coming.

856
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,787
>> I was so joyous to see

857
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,122
all those little kids come

858
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,499
running up to the boat, and

859
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,250
they just grab your hand, and

860
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,377
they have these big smiles on

861
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,669
their faces.

862
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,629
>> Woo-hoo!

863
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,506
>> It was so cool.

864
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,799
A young boy grabbed my hand and

865
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,342
asked me if I wanted to eat,

866
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,927
and I was like, "Yes, I want to

867
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,011
eat."

868
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,974
>> Oh! Oh, God, it is so

869
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,435
good.

870
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,939
>> Oh, my God.

871
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:11,856
>> This is the first thing other

872
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,817
than water I've had in 16 days.

873
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,861
>> Oh, my God.

874
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,988
Sure more food.

875
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,240
They just kept handing you, you

876
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,659
know, rice and soup, and then

877
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,785
some cheese with chicken and

878
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,038
then barbecue chicken.

879
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,041
>> Oh, my God.

880
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,503
>> I'm so happy right now.

881
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,630
>> I just kept eating and eating

882
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,048
and eating 'cause I...

883
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,341
just went crazy and just at

884
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:38,883
everything in sight.

885
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,845
Oh, it was amazing.

886
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,100
>> I'm ecstatic.

887
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,643
It was just really nice to be

888
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,145
around people, other than these

889
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,813
people.

890
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,856
You know, and to see kids, that

891
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,858
made my day.

892
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,695
Just to see those kids-- oh!

893
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,737
Those kids remind me of my

894
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,030
family.

895
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,407
I saw this one little girl, she

896
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,660
looks exactly like my niece.

897
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,954
Oh, God, I miss my kids so bad.

898
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,456
I can't even think about it

899
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,666
right now.

900
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:13,376
It was nice.

901
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,170
It was really good.

902
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,212
Much needed.

903
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,047
I know it's only day 15, but

904
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:22,177
damn, we really needed that.

905
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,888
>> Yay!

906
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,350
>> I saw one of the villagers

907
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,978
smoking, and I was like, oh, no.

908
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,980
The next thought was "All right,

909
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,608
I can give him my shoes and I

910
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,151
can give him my shorts and I can

911
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:38,985
give him my shirt and I can give

912
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,237
him my buff...

913
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:41,905
And here's the deal-- if the guy

914
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,157
would've been like, I want your

915
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,241
underwear too, I probably

916
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,743
would've been naked for the rest

917
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,869
of the afternoon for just one

918
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,830
cigarette.

919
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,670
>> Shane, I'm not happy with

920
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,757
that, buddy.

921
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,258
>> This is probably a really bad

922
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,094
decision.

923
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,306
I remember sitting there in a

924
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,973
stupor going, "Oh, my God, I

925
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,601
can't believe a cigarette is

926
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,395
affecting me like this."

927
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,523
It just shows me how devastating

928
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,526
nicotine is to the body, on

929
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,985
every level.

930
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:21,986
>> You're enjoying that way

931
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,364
too much.

932
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:24,906
Amigos, amigas.

933
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:30,036
No Espanol, but this... so much.

934
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,414
>> The reward kind of brought us

935
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,666
together, but that's the thing,

936
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,250
it's like a double-edge sword

937
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,377
for me.

938
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,003
Yes, yay, we won.

939
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:39,921
I won food, but now that gives

940
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:45,343
Shane time to kind of backtrack.

941
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,010
>> I'm really gonna puke.

942
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,011
>> I should never have treated

943
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,764
you like that.

944
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,766
I apologize, okay?

945
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:52,767
>> I accept.

946
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,351
>> When we leave here, and my

947
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,144
life is normal, I promise you

948
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,145
that I'm going to be a different

949
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,522
person.

950
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,147
And I don't owe anybody on this

951
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,983
island anything except you.

952
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,198
>> Courtney and Danielle,

953
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,993
they're easily persuaded by

954
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,036
Shane's nonsense.

955
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,914
You know what I mean? Damn!

956
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,541
In a way, I almost wanted to

957
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,793
lose, because I really felt that

958
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,294
Shane was going, and then

959
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,380
hopefully, it was Bruce.

960
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,723
(karate yell)

961
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,018
(karate yell)

962
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,478
(applause)

963
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,605
But now that we won and

964
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,398
everybody's all in love again, I

965
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,399
don't know.

966
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,484
Damn!

967
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,485
(drums playing)

968
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,486
(villagers speaking Spanish)

969
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,239
(child squealing)

970
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:54,412
(man singing)

971
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,955
>> I'm so happy right now.

972
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,915
>> You know, today's experience

973
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,416
was one of the top five

974
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,376
experiences of my life.

975
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,085
I was touched and overwhelmed in

976
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,005
so many different ways.

977
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,757
Right when the darkness is

978
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,341
coming, there's this beautiful

979
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,593
dawn, and there's this beautiful

980
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,093
bonding experience.

981
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,178
We got to feast.

982
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,180
We got to hang out.

983
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:12,972
All the stuff that had gone on

984
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,140
the night before got... sort of

985
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,183
got washed away with the

986
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,769
victory.

987
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,770
It was a really, really great

988
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,189
day.

989
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,363
(birds singing)

990
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,118
>> You know what the saddest

991
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,119
part is?

992
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,037
We knew where the first piece

993
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,038
went.

994
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,247
We had it figured out.

995
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:38,998
We knew right where it went.

996
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,501
We went in, and we laid it down

997
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,418
there, and it wouldn't fit.

998
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,419
>> That was the key to the whole

999
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,545
puzzle.

1000
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,588
>> Losing the immunity challenge

1001
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,547
was bad.

1002
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,423
It was... it was game seven for

1003
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,758
us, and we lost it.

1004
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,802
Now Sally's got immunity from

1005
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,095
Tribal Council tonight, and, uh,

1006
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,554
we've got to vote off one of

1007
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,555
our guys.

1008
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,932
>> How can we lose a challenge

1009
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,225
with a puzzle when we have a

1010
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,185
NASA engineer on our team?

1011
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,561
I mean, how do you do that?

1012
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,105
>> I don't know.

1013
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,106
>> This is a young people's

1014
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,107
game right now.

1015
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,108
You know, we can take you a lot

1016
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,192
further in this...

1017
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,276
>> Right.

1018
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,444
>> ...than he can.

1019
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,070
>> If Sally was here, obviously,

1020
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,072
we'd take her, but, you know,

1021
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,783
physically, he's the weakest.

1022
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,159
>> The four of us are all very

1023
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,786
close and have an incredibly

1024
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,246
strong bond, and I know that

1025
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,664
this has to be incredibly

1026
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,582
difficult on Terry to even

1027
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,167
consider eliminating Dan, but

1028
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,586
somebody has to go home, and I

1029
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,840
don't want it to be me.

1030
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:29,841
>> I had it.

1031
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,134
Sitting in that very spot was

1032
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,135
the answer.

1033
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,344
You know, the center piece can't

1034
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,804
rotate now.

1035
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,348
It cannot fit, and to...

1036
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,975
I'll never know why...

1037
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:39,517
>> Well, no use pondering

1038
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,310
it anymore.

1039
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,567
>> It's true.

1040
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,568
It's going to be...

1041
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,569
We're going to have to sort that

1042
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,570
out, 'cause two v. two gets kind

1043
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,571
of sketchy.

1044
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,572
>> Do you think Austin is

1045
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:56,242
interested in leaving?

1046
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,660
>> I don't think so, but I...

1047
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,287
I can ask him, but I-I really

1048
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,539
doubt it.

1049
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,290
>> I ain't going against Terry.

1050
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,417
>> Yeah, I can't vote against

1051
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,209
Austin.

1052
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,294
>> I don't know what's going to

1053
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,295
happen tonight.

1054
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,254
It's probably going to be two v.

1055
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,422
two.

1056
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,757
Uh, Terry and I versus Nick and

1057
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,091
Austin.

1058
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,092
>> I was talking to Dan.

1059
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,177
He's pretty convinced it's going

1060
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,389
to be a two v. two tonight.

1061
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,390
>> Yeah.

1062
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,141
I-I-I...

1063
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,018
He's-He's a friend of mine.

1064
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,060
I like him.

1065
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,854
We have crap loads in common

1066
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,563
with all the flying and

1067
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,482
everything like that, but I feel

1068
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,441
like I'm putting on my Joe Torre

1069
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,442
hat and making a decision for

1070
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,902
the strength of the team, and...

1071
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,944
>> Yeah.

1072
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,820
>> ...there's a couple of

1073
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,530
challenges where he's... not

1074
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,573
come through.

1075
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,908
>> Yeah.

1076
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,493
>> It could have been us, but it

1077
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,494
wasn't.

1078
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,495
It was...

1079
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,496
It was him, so...

1080
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,623
>> Yeah.

1081
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,832
>> I should probably talk to

1082
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,083
him.

1083
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:46,709
I think that the remaining three

1084
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,544
strongest men would be me, Nick

1085
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,962
and Austin.

1086
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:50,338
Dan's odd man out.

1087
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,423
And I feel bad, but

1088
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,675
that's-that's the way it is.

1089
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,136
>> My whole job is about having

1090
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,262
a game plan in place, and if

1091
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,306
it's not quite working out,

1092
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,558
stepping back, and I didn't do

1093
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,559
that.

1094
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,727
Instead, I picked up the puzzle

1095
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,645
piece and started looking

1096
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,354
around randomly.

1097
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,314
And you know what?

1098
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:13,736
If I did that in space, you die.

1099
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,946
>> You know, we-we made a pact

1100
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:15,988
not to lie to one another and

1101
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:16,989
tell each other the truth and

1102
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:17,949
stuff.

1103
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:18,908
>> Right. Absolutely.

1104
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,450
>> And, uh, you know what?

1105
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,077
If...

1106
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,453
I'd take you to the final two

1107
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,371
with you and me if I could,

1108
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,665
so, um...

1109
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,916
I-I feel like I'm making the

1110
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,042
decision for the strength of

1111
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,168
the team tonight.

1112
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,169
>> I hate leaving.

1113
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,170
I hate leaving.

1114
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,171
>> I definitely... I wanted to

1115
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,172
talk to you first.

1116
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,715
I didn't want to make it a

1117
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,552
surprise.

1118
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,887
>> Hey, you know, my fault.

1119
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,221
My bad.

1120
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,557
I got to take responsibility for

1121
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,808
that.

1122
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,434
And as much as I, you know,

1123
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,853
would, you know, love to stay--

1124
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,856
I want to be here-- hey, you

1125
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,482
screw up, you got to... you

1126
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,359
know, you got to take the hit.

1127
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,235
>> Dan and I have something even

1128
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,361
more in common than anybody

1129
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,155
else-- soaring to all kinds of

1130
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:58,739
heights above the Earth-- and

1131
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,658
having to vote him off is a

1132
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,201
highly emotional decision,

1133
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,746
because he's something else.

1134
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,832
Dan has the right stuff.

1135
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:30,980
>> PROBST: Welcome back to

1136
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,941
Tribal Council.

1137
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,568
Let's start by talking about who

1138
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,527
is not here.

1139
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,112
Austin, how big a part of this

1140
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,572
tribe is Sally?

1141
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,239
>> She's a huge part, but you

1142
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,700
know, we had the boys' club and

1143
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,911
Sally, um, but she was saved by

1144
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,954
the move that, um, Casaya made

1145
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,080
today.

1146
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,081
>> PROBST: So, Nick, it was

1147
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:49,957
going to be Sally, the next

1148
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,875
out?

1149
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,751
>> Yeah, Sally would have been

1150
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,752
next.

1151
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,794
>> PROBST: Terry, do you think

1152
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,670
Casaya knew that?

1153
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,671
Sensed that?

1154
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,173
>> It was immediately known that

1155
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:57,798
they were going to pick Sally.

1156
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,468
That meant that we four guys had

1157
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,844
to vote one of us out.

1158
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,304
So, a maybe stronger player is

1159
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:03,846
now going to be leaving the

1160
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,306
game, versus having Sally in

1161
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,934
there, so it was a smart

1162
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,185
strategic move by their point,

1163
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,519
big time.

1164
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,979
>> PROBST: Nick, how tight is

1165
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,980
this group?

1166
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,981
Because it's about to be

1167
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:14,982
splintered.

1168
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:15,983
>> The group's amazingly tight.

1169
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,318
I mean, we were able to talk

1170
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,319
openly tonight.

1171
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,196
It's not a surprise to who's

1172
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,197
going to be leaving tonight.

1173
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,822
It's understood that, you know,

1174
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,490
when you're part of a team, you

1175
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,909
might be the weaker physical,

1176
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,077
you might be the weaker mental--

1177
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,495
whatever your role is-- and we

1178
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,621
accept that.

1179
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,040
So it's-it's been a very

1180
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,083
businesslike process tonight.

1181
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:32,708
>> PROBST: Well, I'm looking at

1182
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,459
the four of you, and so far,

1183
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,418
nobody's face is giving anything

1184
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,294
away.

1185
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,129
I don't know if it's you,

1186
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:37,588
Austin, Terry or Dan.

1187
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,882
>> It's me.

1188
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,175
Uh, they were very up-front with

1189
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,427
me to tell me that, uh, it's my

1190
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,805
turn tonight to go, and today,

1191
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,347
three people performed their

1192
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,558
job, and two people didn't.

1193
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,977
And one of those two people is

1194
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,895
immune, and the other one is

1195
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,980
sitting right here.

1196
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:54,939
And I'm willing to take

1197
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:55,439
responsibility.

1198
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,692
At the same time, I'd be lying

1199
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,359
if I didn't say I was kind of

1200
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,903
hoping, uh, that it was going to

1201
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,530
go maybe a two v. two.

1202
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,447
>> PROBST: Meaning a tie

1203
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,323
between...

1204
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:04,907
>> A tie, you know, and Terry

1205
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,659
and I go one way, and, uh, Nick

1206
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,119
and Austin go the other way.

1207
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,161
>> PROBST: Terry, there's an

1208
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,163
obvious two versus two scenario.

1209
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,415
Did that go through your head

1210
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,374
at any point?

1211
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,375
>> Strategically, we weren't

1212
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,584
going to have to do this till

1213
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,836
we got to the final four, and

1214
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,629
now we're the final four of this

1215
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,673
tribe, and what I'm doing is,

1216
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,590
uh, making a managerial

1217
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,675
decision.

1218
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,342
>> PROBST: Austin, was it clear

1219
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,137
in your mind that there was one

1220
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,723
person who just needed to go?

1221
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,057
They're holding us back.

1222
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:30,725
>> I would never use those words

1223
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,393
to say about my buddy Dan Berry.

1224
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,062
There's nothing about him that

1225
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,355
needs to go.

1226
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,565
We are just down to a situation

1227
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,275
where somebody has to go.

1228
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,568
Dan was the weakest of the four

1229
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,278
of us.

1230
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:42,903
>> PROBST: Dan, what will this

1231
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,864
tribe be losing if you go home

1232
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,865
tonight?

1233
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,532
>> I do a lot around the camp.

1234
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,826
I built the fire shelter.

1235
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,661
I built the, uh, fireplace.

1236
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,370
Uh, Dan Fuego-- I-I take care of

1237
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,497
that part.

1238
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,708
Um, I'm pretty good in the

1239
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,751
water, and in general, I'm a

1240
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,335
great puzzle solver.

1241
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,336
I don't know what happened

1242
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,337
today.

1243
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:00,796
But they are losing a

1244
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,424
substantial contributor.

1245
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,425
>> PROBST: So, Dan, are you just

1246
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,302
taking the sword on this one?

1247
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:06,677
>> No, I'm not.

1248
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,804
Absolutely not.

1249
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,139
If it was my choice, this would

1250
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,307
go two v. two, and we'd have

1251
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,308
a little challenge going on

1252
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,309
here.

1253
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,310
I expected to last a lot longer

1254
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:14,602
than this.

1255
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,854
And in fact, yesterday, I

1256
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,480
thought I was lasting a lot

1257
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,564
longer.

1258
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,523
You know, I'm-I'm solid with

1259
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,399
five people.

1260
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,400
I know there's one person in

1261
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,401
front of me, for sure, if we

1262
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,570
were to lose again.

1263
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,447
It's just... it's incredible how

1264
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,074
fast things turn.

1265
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,450
>> PROBST: Okay, so it does seem

1266
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,659
like tonight's vote is a bit of

1267
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,536
a foregone conclusion, but I've

1268
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,081
seen weirder things happen.

1269
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,083
Well, Terry, you have been to

1270
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,042
Exile Island.

1271
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,126
The immunity idol could come

1272
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,002
into play.

1273
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,003
You'll let me know after the

1274
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,296
vote if that is indeed the case.

1275
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:43,506
It is time to vote.

1276
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,759
Nick, you're up.

1277
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,413
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1278
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,581
votes.

1279
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,174
Once the votes are read, the

1280
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,342
decision is final.

1281
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:28,968
The person voted out will be

1282
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:29,927
asked to leave the Tribal

1283
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,970
Council area immediately.

1284
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,431
I'll read the votes.

1285
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:37,518
First vote, Dan.

1286
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,524
Austin.

1287
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,944
Dan.

1288
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:47,945
That's two votes Dan, one vote

1289
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:52,199
Austin, one vote left.

1290
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,827
Sixth person voted out of

1291
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,954
<i>Survivor: Exile Island,</i> Dan.

1292
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,539
You need to bring me your torch.

1293
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,957
>> Good luck, my boys.

1294
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,209
(indistinct chatter)

1295
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,466
>> PROBST: Dan, the tribe has

1296
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,595
spoken.

1297
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,430
Time to go.

1298
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,472
>> See you, Dan-o.

1299
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,600
>> See you, Dan.

1300
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,817
>> PROBST: Seemed like a tough

1301
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,027
vote.

1302
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,320
Probably won't be your last.

1303
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:29,945
Grab your torches, head back to

1304
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,697
camp.

1305
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,783

I'm ready to get in there, see

1318
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,807
if I can come out victorious.

1319
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,683
>> You come over, and<i> we</i> will go

1320
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,559
to the final five.

1321
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,101
>> PROBST: Terry wheels and

1322
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,436
deals.

1323
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,229
>> I'm just looking for two

1324
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,104
people to swing the total game

1325
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:04,939
our way.

1326
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:05,940
>> PROBST: And Bruce gets

1327
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:06,941
whacked.

1328
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:07,316
>> You know what?

1329
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,567
>> I just hit Bruce in the face

1330
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,193
with a machete.

1331
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,820
I'm out of here.

1332
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,159
>> I was a little surprised by

1333
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,285
Terry's decision.

1334
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,536
I would never have voted for

1335
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,538
Terry, but he's got to play his

1336
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,538
game.

1337
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,539
I know that you did what you

1338
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,249
felt you had to do.

1339
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:23,874
I respect that, and I wish them

1340
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,085
all the best.

1341
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,128
This was a wonderful adventure.

1342
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,505
I loved every day out here, and

1343
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,130
the only thing I really have to

1344
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,757
say is, thank you to my family

1345
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,592
for letting Dad go off on

1346
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,678
another crazy adventure.
