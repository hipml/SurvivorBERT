2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,269
the Rembrandt van Rijn,&nbsp;
heading south off the coast of

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,272
Panama to a remote
location&nbsp;
in the Pacific waters

4
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,275
of Central America.&nbsp;
Down below, 16 Americans

5
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,279
who have no idea the
adventure&nbsp;
of a lifetime has already begun.

6
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,282
After traveling all night,&nbsp;
they arrived Panama City

7
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,285
early this morning,&nbsp;
boarded this vessel,

8
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,287
suitcases still in tow,&nbsp;
still wearing the same clothes

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,290
they had on on the plane.&nbsp;
Right now, they're relaxing

10
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,294
under the false assumption&nbsp;
that we are several days away

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,296
from starting the game.&nbsp;
They think we're heading out

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,299
to take publicity photos.&nbsp;
What they don't know,

13
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,303
this game has already
started,&nbsp;
and it is full of surprises.

14
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,306
For instance, those
suitcases,&nbsp;
so carefully packed with

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,267
essential outdoor
clothing--&nbsp;
worthless.

16
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,311
The only clothes&nbsp;
they're going to be taking

17
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:05,315
are the clothes on their
back.&nbsp;
And more twists await.

18
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,317
Their destination--&nbsp;
the Pearl Islands--

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,320
a land with a bloody
history&nbsp;
of looting and piracy.

20
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,323
Brutal battles took place
in&nbsp;
these waters as pirates preyed

21
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,326
on unsuspecting ships,&nbsp;
plundering their gold, silver

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,329
and pearls.&nbsp;
( pirates shouting )

23
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,332
The jungles, which were
the&nbsp;
perfect hideout for these

24
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,335
pirates, are rugged.&nbsp;
The weather, temperamental.

25
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,338
The waters here are home&nbsp;
to some of the most magnificent,

26
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,341
but deadly, marine life&nbsp;
anywhere in the Pacific Ocean.

27
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:36,346
Sharks, stingrays, eels,&nbsp;
even whales thrive in a

28
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,349
spectacular world beneath
the&nbsp;
sea.

29
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,352
This will be their home&nbsp;
for the next 39 days.

30
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,355
They must learn to adapt,&nbsp;
or they'll be voted out

31
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,357
of the tribe.&nbsp;
In the end, only one will

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,237
remain to claim the
million-&nbsp;
dollar prize.

33
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:03,248
39 days, 16 people...&nbsp;

survivors have been
allowed&nbsp;
to go through their luggage

You guys won't have that
luxury.&nbsp;
( nervous giggling )

on your back...&nbsp;

How am I going to get by?

52
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,522
What am I going to do&nbsp;
with a suit?

53

Here are your tennis shoes.

and any jewelry you don't
want&nbsp;
to lose...

66
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,561

Bags are staying behind,

67
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,562

go through your bags,

68

pirates in Panamanian
history--&nbsp;
the Drake Tribe, after Sir

75
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:39,589
Francis Drake, and the
Morgan&nbsp;
Tribe, after Henry Morgan.

76
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,591
So, as I call out your
name,&nbsp;
you'll come forward,

77
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:48,598
we'll divide into tribes.&nbsp;
First up: Shawn... wearing blue.

Osten, come on up.&nbsp;
Look at that loot.

84
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,623

That is pirate-like.

85
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,626
You got booze, music.&nbsp;
>> That's booty.

86
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,631

member&nbsp;
of the Drake Tribe.

87
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,882
Have a spot.&nbsp;
Welcome.

88
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,636

I thought, "This dude is cool.

89
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,639
"He's a big old hippie,&nbsp;
and, uh, he looks strong as an

Next member for the Morgan

Tribe: Tijuana.&nbsp;
Look at those heels.

99
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:09,679
>> Tijuana, she's
unbelievable.&nbsp;
She's a Nubian princess.

100
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,683
That's how good-looking she
is.&nbsp;

Let me hear it!&nbsp;
>> PROBST: The Morgan Tribe's

00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,714

Here's the woman

110
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,923
who's wearing nothing&nbsp;
under her dress--

111
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,719
come on down, Nicole.&nbsp;
>> Found a new use for this

Works as a great tube top.&nbsp;
Personal items, please.

114
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:58,728
And you're over there.&nbsp;
Give me those personal items.

thought&nbsp;
the clothing issue was tough,

120
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,750
it's about to get worse,&nbsp;
because when you arrive

121
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,753
at your camp, there's
nothing&nbsp;
waiting for you there, either.

122
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:28,758
Nothing-- no food
whatsoever,&nbsp;
not the first bit of tools,

123
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,761
no flint and steel&nbsp;
to start fire.

124
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,764
I mean zip.&nbsp;
What I can offer you, though,

125
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,767
is this--&nbsp;
the opportunity to control

126
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,772
your own fate.&nbsp;
100 Balboas in here--

You're in luck, it's market day.

129
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,781
I'm not going to lie to
you.&nbsp;
It's a small village,

130
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,783
there's not a lot there,&nbsp;
but if you're smart

131
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,785
and you have a plan,&nbsp;
you can get everything

132
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,747
you need-- the essentials
to&nbsp;
help you survive 39 days.

133
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,792
Explore this village.&nbsp;
There's a lot of nooks and

134
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,794
crannies, knock on doors.&nbsp;
When you run out of money,

135
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,796
barter with what you have,&nbsp;
which is, granted,

136
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,801
not much, but use it.&nbsp;
You're not coming back here.

137
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,805
Map to your new home.&nbsp;
You must set aside enough money

138
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,809
to hire a boat and a
driver&nbsp;
to get you to your camps.

139
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,812
You each will have your
own&nbsp;
island, and they are a long

140
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,815

You need to be there by sundown.

141
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,819
Got a lot to accomplish&nbsp;
in the next few hours.

142
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,070
You're going to have&nbsp;
to work together

143
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,824

I wish you the very best of

the village and get to certain

places and find where stuff
was&nbsp;
first and also try to find

186
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,993
where the boat was.&nbsp;
And I run all the way down

187
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,995
to the boat dock,&nbsp;
and I didn't have a map.

00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:09,038
and I needed to rest.&nbsp;
The other team, Morgan,

199
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:15,044
came up, sat their stuff
down&nbsp;
next to us, and all left.

This is definitely&nbsp;
a pirate adventure.

insoles.&nbsp;
Everything that I could find

206
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,066
in theirs, I took.&nbsp;
I've always said I will lie,

207
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,068
cheat and steal&nbsp;
to win this game.

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,079

Feel that.

00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:58,087

For a pineapple?

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,090
Shoes...&nbsp;
>> ¿Cambiarlo por eso?

215
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:07,096
>> Pineapple? Yeah?&nbsp;
We are pirates... so we pirated.

216
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,976
Yeah, it's a hard life,&nbsp;
living the pirate's life.

217
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,109
>> We got water.&nbsp;
>> We got water?

218
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,111
Okay, we need, um...&nbsp;
>> Machete?

219
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,113
>> We got, we got,&nbsp;
we got knives, we got knives.

220
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,114
>> We need flint steel?&nbsp;
>> How 'bout food?

221
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,407
>> Yeah.&nbsp;
>> Yeah. Fishing stuff.

222
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,118
Where's the fishing stuff?&nbsp;
Hold on, let me ask this lady.

223
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,121
The way we attacked
getting&nbsp;
our supplies at the village

224
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:36,125
was, uh, a bit chaotic.&nbsp;
It was confusion.

225
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,128
>> Rice? Rice?&nbsp;
>> Rice.

226
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,131
>> Hey, Ryan, how many
candles?&nbsp;
>> You want to buy a belt?

227
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,424
By chance?&nbsp;
Buy a belt.

228
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,135
Stand up real quick, come
on.&nbsp;
Stand up, come here.

229
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,137
We only had a limited
amount&nbsp;
of money, so I made an

230
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,141
impulsive decision to sell&nbsp;
my clothes to benefit my tribe.

231
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,143
Slide them right in there.&nbsp;
Look at that.

232
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,146
That's unbelievable.&nbsp;
That looks... that looks great.

233
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,148
How, how...&nbsp;
I sell it to you?

234
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,150
Dos Balboas.&nbsp;
Thank you, partner.

235
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,152
I appreciate it.&nbsp;
You know, you got

236
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,154
to fast-talk some people.&nbsp;
And I was willing to try

237
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,156
to do whatever it took&nbsp;
to-to make the sale

238
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,158
so that we could have&nbsp;
more money for my group

239
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,160
to do whatever we needed&nbsp;
to do with the money.

240
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,162
>> Let me, uh, let me
talk...&nbsp;
Can I talk to two girls real

241
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,163
quick?&nbsp;
>> Mm-hmm.

242
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,166
>> Just a little strategy.&nbsp;
Come here.

243
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,168
>> I'm listening, too.&nbsp;
>> Okay, come on.

244
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,171
( speaking indistinctly )&nbsp;
But you know old, old men

245
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,173
are real horny.&nbsp;
So, maybe sometimes if we don't

246
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,175
have money, flash your
boobs--&nbsp;
give 'em a quick peek or

247
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,177
something like that, all
right?&nbsp;
I don't mean to be rude,

248
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,180
but that-that could help.&nbsp;
>> Osten goes, "You know, girls,

249
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,182
"we don't necessarily&nbsp;
have to spend our money.

250
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,183
"With these old guys.&nbsp;
"they're really horny,

251
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,185
so you can just show them&nbsp;
your boobs."

252
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,187
He didn't even know our
names,&nbsp;
really yet, or-or us at all.

253
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,189
That was his first, you
know,&nbsp;
introduction to us.

254
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,191
So I was just, like,&nbsp;
"This guy's a jerk."

255
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:55,204
( cheering )&nbsp;
( speaking Spanish )

256
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,206
>> Hey, guys.&nbsp;
Wanna buy...?

257
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:04,213
>> Dos Balboas.&nbsp;
( speaking Spanish )

258
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,215
>> Okay, let's go.&nbsp;
We'll come back.

259
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,217
>> Yeah.&nbsp;
>> He wants three and three,

260
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,219
but the guy told us&nbsp;
two up there.

261
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,222
We buy the rice from him.&nbsp;
>> Sandra, she was so amazing

262
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,225
in the town, because she
spoke&nbsp;
the language and worked out all

263
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,227
these incredible deals.&nbsp;
And we would...

264
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,232
it wouldn't have been
possible.&nbsp;
( speaking Spanish )

265
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,236
>> Hola!&nbsp;
>> Hola!

266
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,239
>> When we got to the village,
I&nbsp;
was lucky that I knew Spanish.

267
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,241
And I was trying to
bargain&nbsp;
with the lady at the store

268
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,243
and ask people for certain&nbsp;
things.

269
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,247
>> What's the cheapest
lantern?&nbsp;
And do they...?

270
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:44,128
( Sandra speaking Spanish
)&nbsp;
>> Por favor.

271
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,264
She'll do it for your
eyes.&nbsp;
>> Oh, gracias!

272
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,268
>> Your eyes for her...&nbsp;
>> Gracias! Oh!

273
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,271
>> The lady at the store&nbsp;
had it in for Trisha.

274
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,273
Trisha thought the lady&nbsp;
was laughing and giggling

275
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,275
with her or whatever.&nbsp;
But the lady actually, I think,

276
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:11,238
you know, liked her in a&nbsp;
sexual way.

277
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,285
There's, uh, Trisha
hugging&nbsp;
the lady, laughing and giggling

278
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,288
like it's all good.&nbsp;
And I'm like, "Yo, we need to

279
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,414
go."&nbsp;
You got to stay with her.

280
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,291
We're gonna leave you&nbsp;
here for a few minutes.

281
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,293
>> I feel that the village&nbsp;
people really respected Sandra

282
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,296
because she was being nice&nbsp;
and decent about things

283
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,298
and respectful,&nbsp;
unlike the other tribe

284
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,301
that was screaming at
people.&nbsp;
>> Give me my money back.

285
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,303
Money.&nbsp;
I need my money back.

286
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,306
I don't want it.&nbsp;
Money.

287
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,308
Okay, if y'all gonna&nbsp;
steal from me,

288
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,310
I'm gonna steal from
y'all.&nbsp;
>> Yeah, this is the one

289
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,478
we paid for.&nbsp;
>> Gracias, gracias.

290
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,314
>> We, we... we gave the
money.&nbsp;
We... No, no...

291
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,316
>> Gracias.&nbsp;
>> No, no, no, no, no, no.

292
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,318
>> Then don't do this!&nbsp;
Don't do this!

293
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,320
>> No, no, no, no, no.&nbsp;
>> Where's the money at?

294
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,321
>> Where's our money?&nbsp;
>> No, no.

295
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,324
>> Sí!&nbsp;
>> Muy poquito.

296
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,326
>> We're walking out with&nbsp;
the merchandise we paid for,

297
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,328
then another person says,&nbsp;
"No, you didn't pay for it"?!

298
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,331
Wait, what?&nbsp;
I-I'm sorry?

299
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,333
So, it definitely was a&nbsp;
difficult situation,

300
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,335
especially when you don't
know&nbsp;
all of the words

301
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,336
that you need to say.&nbsp;
No!

302
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,754
>> No, no, no.&nbsp;
>> Where's the money?

303
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,339
>> Hey, hey, she, she just
told&nbsp;
you she gave you the money.

304
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:15,344
>> No, no, no.&nbsp;
>> Sí! You're stealing.

305
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,346
>> I don't really get
along&nbsp;
with Tijuana.

306
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,349
She seemed, like,
extremely&nbsp;
overexcited about certain

307
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,351
things, and that was just&nbsp;
frustrating for me.

308
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,353
>> Where's the money?&nbsp;
Okay, where's the money?

309
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,357
( overlapping shouts )&nbsp;
>> We handled it to the best

310
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,359
of our ability.&nbsp;
And in the end, they came out

311
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,361
on top by saying,
"Basically,&nbsp;
we'll give this to you."

312
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:37,366
>> Okay, God will bless
you.&nbsp;
>> So it worked out well.

313
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:48,377
( singing and clapping )&nbsp;
>> We went around the corner,

314
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,380
and there was this lady&nbsp;
having... they were dancing.

315
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,382
She was having a barbecue,&nbsp;
and I says, "You know,

316
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,385
I'll give you this gold
chain&nbsp;
for everything you have here."

317
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,387
And she looked at my
chain,&nbsp;
she was like, "Yeah."

318
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,390
I put the chain around her&nbsp;
neck, and she was like,

319
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,392
"What do you want?"&nbsp;
I said, "I want all your

320
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,394
chicken, I want your
aluminum&nbsp;
foil.

321
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,397
I want your ketchup, your&nbsp;
hot sauce, the barbecue sauce."

322
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,400
She had a cutting board,&nbsp;
a knife.

323
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,401
Everything.&nbsp;
The only thing we didn't take

324
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,403
was the grill.&nbsp;
>> Yo, Blackbeard!

325
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,407
>> Oh, you won't
believe...&nbsp;
>> She just traded her necklace.

326
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,408
>> For my gold chain.&nbsp;
>> For her gold chain,

327
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,409
we have...&nbsp;
>> I got knives...

328
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,412
>> Oh, my God!&nbsp;
>> Ketchup, hot sauce...

329
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,416
>> I was definitely pissed&nbsp;
to see the Drake Tribe and all

330
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,418
of the wealth that they'd
come&nbsp;
into, all of the fortune.

331
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,421
That definitely just kind&nbsp;
of deflates you a little bit,

332
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,423
like, "Man, we could have&nbsp;
done that."

333
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,591
We could have been&nbsp;
even more prepared.

334
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,426
They were taking their
time,&nbsp;
and we weren't.

335
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,510
Okay, we got&nbsp;
to get down there.

336
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,429
Let's get all our group--&nbsp;
it's a long walk.

337
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,430
Come on.&nbsp;
You need help carrying

338
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,431
or you good?&nbsp;
>> I got it.

339
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,599
>> Let's rock.&nbsp;
>> Where we going?

340
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,434
We got tons of money.&nbsp;
>> All right. Hey, Osten!

341
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,437
We got tons of money!&nbsp;
>> We got money.

342
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,439
>> We had money left over.&nbsp;
Are we going to the boat now?

343
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,441
Can we go get more-more
fruit?&nbsp;
We have more money.

344
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,444
We should have spent
absolutely&nbsp;
all of the money.

345
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,446
I don't think we, uh,&nbsp;
fundamentally did-did

346
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,448
the right, right decision.&nbsp;
I think, I think we could have

347
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,451
gotten a few more good
supplies.&nbsp;
I think people

348
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,454
were just too anxious&nbsp;
to get on the boat and get-get

349
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,456
the thing started.&nbsp;
>> You said 35, so...

350
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,457
>> Treinta y cinco.&nbsp;
>> Okay, thank you.

351
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,460
Thank you.&nbsp;
Okay, we're loading right now.

352
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:17,341
As far as getting enough of
what&nbsp;
we need, only time will tell.

353
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:36,485
( snorting )&nbsp;
>> Let's see, we have rice,

354
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,487
we have beans, we have a&nbsp;
container for the rice.

355
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,489
>> We got coconuts.&nbsp;
We got another chicken.

356
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,491
>> You know, I don't know&nbsp;
what more we need, really.

357
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,493
>> We did very well&nbsp;
in the village.

358
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,495
You know, we, we managed&nbsp;
to get a ton of stuff

359
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,374
for the little bit&nbsp;
of money we had.

360
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,503
>> We got fishing line,&nbsp;
a bunch of hooks.

361
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,507
I know we got a fishing
spear,&nbsp;
uh, for catching fish.

362
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,511
Um, we got wine,&nbsp;
we got a-a huge tarp,

363
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,513
we got two machetes,&nbsp;
which are essential.

364
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,515
>> We did good. We did
good.&nbsp;
>> We got so much.

365
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,519
I can't believe how much we
got.&nbsp;
>> I put about $40 in my pocket,

366
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,522
so it wouldn't be in the
bag,&nbsp;
just as a safety measure.

367
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,524
'Cause I figured, with
that,&nbsp;
I can definitely get a ride.

368
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,526
Treinta y cinco is a deal.&nbsp;
Treinta y...

369
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,528
>> Okay.&nbsp;
>> Yeah?

370
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,530
All right.&nbsp;
Let's go, guys.

371
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,531
Get the chicken!&nbsp;
Get the chicken!

372
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,533
Oh, you...&nbsp;
Get the chicken!

373
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,412
Stop the chicken!&nbsp;
Stop the chicken!

374
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:42,551
( Rupert laughing )&nbsp;
We're pretty well fit

375
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,553
for the jungle right now.&nbsp;
I think we're...

376
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:50,434
we're definitely ready to
go&nbsp;
all-out for the next 40 days.

377
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,578
>> Seeing the flag, I'm&nbsp;
thinking, "I can't believe I'm

378
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,746
here.&nbsp;
This is the coolest thing

379
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,581
that's ever happened to me in
my&nbsp;
entire life."

380
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,583
I think that should be&nbsp;
the first big celebration,

381
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,463
the sheer excitement.&nbsp;
There was none of that.

382
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,598
What do you guys think?&nbsp;
>> Want to get everybody here so

383
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,600
we can say what we're going
to&nbsp;
do.

384
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,602
>> I got off the boat
last.&nbsp;
I walked up, and already

385
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,604
people were talking about,&nbsp;
"Where do we want to put camp?"

386
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:41,610
Blah, blah, blah.&nbsp;
I was, like, "Man, we're here!

387
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,612
"Let's jump up and down.&nbsp;
Let's give some hugs.

388
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,614
Let's do something."&nbsp;
There's none of that.

389
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,616
>> Someone get down there,&nbsp;
we'll scout out the area.

390
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,618
>> You know, we...&nbsp;
>> Get the fire going.

391
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,621
And the heavier people
can,&nbsp;
uh, can move the stuff,

392
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,623
move the cargo.&nbsp;
I was in game mode.

393
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,625
I wanted to get it done.&nbsp;
The words "Sunrise is going

394
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,587
down quickly" came in my
head.&nbsp;
I knew that we needed

395
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,797
to act fast.&nbsp;
I'd say we have

396
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,632
more room down there,&nbsp;
but if you guys want to all,

397
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,634
as a group, go run down
there?&nbsp;
You want to go walk out real

398
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,636
quick, so we can just get&nbsp;
the fire done like that?

399
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,637
>> Yeah.&nbsp;
>> Let's go running.

400
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:16,645
We don't have a lot of
time.&nbsp;
Whoo!

401
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,647
>> Osten was running up
and&nbsp;
down, looking for the perfect

402
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,650
spot to put the camp.&nbsp;
Osten's a big dude.

403
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,652
I mean, he's got, like,&nbsp;
muscles out to yay,

404
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,656
and, uh, I've been noticing
them&nbsp;
the whole time.

405
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,658
Because he-he lets you
know&nbsp;
he has muscles,

406
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,660
lets you know,&nbsp;
"Hey, I am strong."

407
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,663
I'm like, okay.&nbsp;
>> We can cut a couple of these

408
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,665
branches down.&nbsp;
These will kind of, like,

409
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,668
protect us from the...&nbsp;
from the rain a little bit.

410
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,671
You want to start the
fire,&nbsp;
and I'll start bringing stuff

411
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,674
over here?&nbsp;
>> Okay.

412
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,677
>> Lillian in her scout
uniform&nbsp;
was interesting, to say the

413
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,679
least.&nbsp;
I was completely thrown off-

414
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,682
kilter when I saw that.&nbsp;
I didn't know what the hell was

415
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,685
going on or was it a joke&nbsp;
or what was going on.

416
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,688
I was just confused.&nbsp;
>> Here, I'll blow on it.

417
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,691
>> My troop back home would
kick&nbsp;
my butt knowing I'm using a

418
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,694
candle.&nbsp;
It's real hard to take off

419
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,697
this scout hat.&nbsp;
It's real hard not to be

420
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,700
the scoutmaster here.&nbsp;
Oh, baby.

421
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,702
>> Good job.&nbsp;
>> Oh, baby.

422
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,705
Team effort here, girl.&nbsp;
>> Yeah.

423
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,707
>> If we build the shelter&nbsp;
like this, into the rock,

424
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,711
lean it up against the
rock.&nbsp;
You want to do that?

425
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,713
A lot less work.&nbsp;
>> There's this big shale

426
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,716
rock wall, and we think&nbsp;
there's this great bamboo post

427
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,719
just naturally lying
around,&nbsp;
and we're like,

428
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:35,599
"This is the best."&nbsp;
( grunting )

429
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,730
>> Oh, my goodness!&nbsp;
>> We made sure we had

430
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,732
somewhat of a shelter.&nbsp;
It was a... a lean-to.

431
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,735
( laughs )&nbsp;
But... oh, well.

432
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,614
You can only do so much&nbsp;
in that amount of time.

433
00:24:52,824 --> 00:25:00,707
( cheering )&nbsp;
>> Whoo-hoo!

434
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,752
>> All right, guys.&nbsp;
>> Some rice, baby.

435
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,754
>> Don't waste the food.&nbsp;
>> It's home sweet home.

436
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,757
>> I think that's it.&nbsp;
>> Are you all right, guys?

437
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,760
Come on in.&nbsp;
We're all here.

438
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,762
We're going to have&nbsp;
the time of our life,

439
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,764
and at the same time we're&nbsp;
going to kick some butt.

440
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,768
>> Yeah!&nbsp;
>> Great, great, great.

441
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,647
>> First things first,&nbsp;
let's get a shelter built.

442
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,777
If we build a shelter,
like,&nbsp;
here, we can go around the tree.

443
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,779
>> This would be cool.&nbsp;
>> Yeah, this would be, right

444
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,780
here.&nbsp;
We're going to build

445
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,782
something over this way.&nbsp;
>> A shelter.

446
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,784
>> Yeah, like a little
shelter.&nbsp;
>> The shelter could go from

447
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,786
here to here, easily.&nbsp;
>> Burton, as well as, um,

448
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,788
myself, you know, off the
start,&nbsp;
we started getting

449
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,790
everything going.&nbsp;
We were just a little more

450
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,792
strong personalities,&nbsp;
a little more physical,

451
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,796
you know, mentally, as
well.&nbsp;
>> So what's the priority?

452
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,798
Bamboo or firewood, do you&nbsp;
think?

453
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:57,806
>> Both.&nbsp;
>> I was surprised at how

454
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:02,811
quickly we all worked
together.&nbsp;
I mean, we didn't know who we

455
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,813
were, what your name was
yet.&nbsp;
And, um, within a matter

456
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,817
of probably ten minutes,&nbsp;
we all sort of spread out and

457
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,820
it worked out pretty well.&nbsp;
>> One of the first items

458
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,822
on our to-do list&nbsp;
when we got here

459
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,824
was build a shelter.&nbsp;
And we did that.

460
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,826
Actually, it looked&nbsp;
pretty good.

461
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,829
>> Yay!&nbsp;
>> You know what we need?

462
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,832
A little bit bigger
firewood.&nbsp;
>> Bigger firewood?

463
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,834
>> We will pretty soon.&nbsp;
>> I was really tired,

464
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,838
I mean, just exhausted.&nbsp;
It was like, "for the love of

465
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,840
God."&nbsp;
I mean, I just wanted

466
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,841
to breathe for a second.&nbsp;
I was like,

467
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,844
"Does anybody have water?"&nbsp;
>> Here we go.

468
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:41,850
>> Burton opened up a
coconut,&nbsp;
and he shared the coconut milk

469
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,855
with only Shawn and
Michelle.&nbsp;
I gave Christa the look and I

470
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,856
said, "Did they offer you&nbsp;
any coconut milk?"

471
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,859
And she was like,&nbsp;
"No, and I wanted some."

472
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:55,864
>> Ah, refreshing.&nbsp;
>> Over the other side,

473
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,868
actually. Yeah.&nbsp;
>> Shawn and Burton are a little

474
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,871
out there in their
leadership.&nbsp;
>> It's a waste to just have it

475
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,873
lying underneath like
that.&nbsp;
It's not doing anything.

476
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,875
>> Put it the other way.&nbsp;
>> I have a better idea.

477
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,878
>> I just think they need&nbsp;
to be a little careful of that,

478
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,880
because they've already&nbsp;
alienated some people.

479
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,882
>> I love when people&nbsp;
with a beard, it's like, it

480
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,886
catches anything that
falls.&nbsp;
( laughter )

481
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,888
>> Shawn is being a pain&nbsp;
in the butt.

482
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:24,893
We're a strong little
team,&nbsp;
but the dynamic duo there that

483
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,897
are posturing for the lead
role&nbsp;
need to be a little more

484
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,777
careful, because they're
going&nbsp;
to make everybody hate them.

485
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,907
>> There's the other tree.&nbsp;
After making the shelter,

486
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,912
we went to go get water.&nbsp;
Water well, big tree.

487
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:48,917
The map says, "Go up a
trail&nbsp;
and to the right."

488
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,919
>> There it is.&nbsp;
>> We got water.

489
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,922
>> It's about a quarter of
a&nbsp;
mile to our water.

490
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,924
It's not that bad.&nbsp;
However, that's where

491
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,928
every single mosquito&nbsp;
on this planet lives.

492
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,931
Every one of them.&nbsp;
Holy mosquito city.

493
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,933
>> They are having parties
all&nbsp;
over me.

494
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,935
>> We didn't get any, uh,
bug&nbsp;
oil?

495
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,937
>> Oh, my God.&nbsp;
I'm getting attacked.

496
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,940
>> I am getting eaten
alive.&nbsp;
Every single one of us.

497
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,943
It's worse than I have&nbsp;
ever, ever, ever seen.

498
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,946
We got to get out of here.&nbsp;
God, these bastards

499
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,950
are everywhere.&nbsp;
>> Oh, you're just...

500
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,953
>> Mine's, like, the
craziest.&nbsp;
Oh, my God, you're not too great

501
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,955
yourself.&nbsp;
>> We were getting torn up

502
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,958
pretty bad.&nbsp;
I'm the least out of anyone.

503
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,960
That's it.&nbsp;
That's all I got.

504
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,962
Shawn?&nbsp;
(laughs)

505
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:39,843
He looks like the moon,&nbsp;
except in reverse.

506
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,981
>> There's not much water.&nbsp;
>> We're out of water?

507
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,983
>> We've gone through it, a
lot.&nbsp;
We only brought, like, 18.

508
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,985
>> How much of that do we
have&nbsp;
left?

509
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,987
I don't think we should&nbsp;
be drinking any more,

510
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,196
unless we go find some&nbsp;
and boil some...

511
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,990
>> Yeah, I think we...&nbsp;
>> We need to go find some.

512
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,992
>> I think water's going&nbsp;
to be real important.

513
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,996
>> Okay.&nbsp;
>> So what is... what is your

514
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,998
sense of water supply?&nbsp;
What-what are your

515
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,000
instincts on this?&nbsp;
>> I don't know.

516
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,002
I mean I, I...&nbsp;
I was looking for something

517
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,005
that, you know, followed&nbsp;
us up into something,

518
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,007
like animals would.&nbsp;
>> Yeah.

519
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,012
>> We saw some running
water,&nbsp;
and, uh, looked pretty orange,

520
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,014
it looked rusty.&nbsp;
It was not the kind of water

521
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:30,018
you'd want to drink,&nbsp;
even if you boiled it 42 hours.

522
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,020
>> Stagnant water like that
has&nbsp;
a bunch of diseases in it.

523
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,022
>> Yeah, that's pretty...&nbsp;
>> Looks like beer.

524
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:39,027
>> We meandered throughout
this&nbsp;
beach trying to guesstimate

525
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,030
where the water may or may
not&nbsp;
be, which was just a crucial

526
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,032
mistake.&nbsp;
Water's essential.

527
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,035
You need that.&nbsp;
The... the heat, the humidity,

528
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,038
your body's evaporating
fluids&nbsp;
constantly.

529
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,041
They need to be
replenished,&nbsp;
or you'll dehydrate

530
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,044
and you'll be going home.&nbsp;
And I don't want

531
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:06,888
to go home right now.&nbsp;
( clattering )

532
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,059
to go home right now.&nbsp;
( clattering )

533
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,062
>> Uh-oh.&nbsp;
>> What was that?

534
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,064
>> Rocks and something
falling.&nbsp;
>> No.

535
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,066
>> Huh?&nbsp;
>> No.

536
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,069
>> Yeah, it was.&nbsp;
From up... right up here.

537
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,071
>> The rocks falling from
the&nbsp;
cliff, um, that just didn't

538
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,073
work out at all.&nbsp;
Because we think it's going

539
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,952
to get worse,&nbsp;
especially if it starts to rain.

540
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,081
>> Ow!&nbsp;
Something bit my ass!

541
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,083
( laughing )&nbsp;
>> Are you serious?

542
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,087
>> I am!&nbsp;
( laughing )

543
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,091
>> What the hell is it?&nbsp;
( screaming laughter )

544
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,093
It felt like a crab!&nbsp;
What is that?

545
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,095
I have a feeling it was a
crab.&nbsp;
Oh, now, how am

546
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,098
I going to sleep?&nbsp;
As far as the little hermit

547
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,101
crabs, we think that we're&nbsp;
living in their home, pretty

548
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,103
much, because they were
just&nbsp;
crawling all over us, and they

549
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,271
pinch.&nbsp;
And there were, I mean,

550
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,106
literally dozens of them&nbsp;
crawling through there.

551
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,108
Why don't we just build&nbsp;
a shelter that's in the...

552
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,111
the middle of a ring of
fire?&nbsp;
And then no crabs can get to us.

553
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,113
>> My mistake not lifting&nbsp;
the shelter off the ground.

554
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:09,117
I'm sorry.&nbsp;
>> Whoa, whoa.

555
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,121
We got a snake!&nbsp;
>> Are you kidding?!

556
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:18,126
( laughter )&nbsp;
>> That's not a snake, it's a

557
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,128
frond.&nbsp;
>> Osten thought there was a

558
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,131
snake, but it was a palm
frond&nbsp;
that kept curling and moving.

559
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,133
And he freakin'...&nbsp;
he's pushing people out

560
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,135
of there, and we're
laughing.&nbsp;
>> Holy mackerel.

561
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,219
>> Oh, my God...&nbsp;
>> I could have swore it

562
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,138
was, like, slithering.&nbsp;
It kept coming down.

563
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,140
If I see something&nbsp;
or feel something, I

564
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,142
automatically go right
into...&nbsp;
freak-out mode,

565
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,145
and I don't know why.&nbsp;
Every time.

566
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,148
It-it just never fails.&nbsp;
I, honest to God, thought I saw

567
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,150
a snake.&nbsp;
I'm not, I'm not even lying...

568
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,318
>> I, honest to God,
believe&nbsp;
you.

569
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,153
>> It's hilarious--&nbsp;
we call him "Scary Mary,"

570
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,321
because he's never really
been&nbsp;
in a jungle environment.

571
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,157
Any little thing...&nbsp;
and if it touches his toe,

572
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,160
he leaps out of the air&nbsp;
and just shrieks.

573
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,244
( rumbling )&nbsp;
( gasps )

574
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,163
>> How close was that?&nbsp;
>> Was that a rock?

575
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,165
>> That was a rock.&nbsp;
>> That was a rock.

576
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:08,176
>> Damn.&nbsp;
>> All right.

577
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,179
Let's do a toast.&nbsp;
To new friends, good friends

578
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,181
and nobody going home&nbsp;
anytime soon.

579
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,183
>> Whoo!&nbsp;
>> Yay!

580
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,185
( light applause )&nbsp;
>> I was big on getting the

581
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,187
booze yesterday.&nbsp;
We ended up trading a pair

582
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,190
of mismatched shoes&nbsp;
for some jugs of wine.

583
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,193
And that was a big deal to
me.&nbsp;
Oh, good golly.

584
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,195
>> We didn't get any
light,&nbsp;
we didn't get any soap...

585
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,197
>> But we need booze.&nbsp;
>> We got booze.

586
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,199
>> We got booze and
shelter.&nbsp;
What else do you need?

587
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,202
>> I don't know if it's&nbsp;
moonshine, wine, or just grain

588
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,205
alcohol, but we crack it
open&nbsp;
and taste it, it's the best-

589
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,208
tasting stuff we've ever
had.&nbsp;
That's good stuff, huh?

590
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,376
>> Oh, God, yeah.&nbsp;
>> That is really good.

591
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,211
>> Man, if you guys were
17,&nbsp;
you'd so be naked.

592
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,214
>> Like at the 7-11.&nbsp;
The wah-wah...

593
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,218
>> Jon, he reminds me of my
boys&nbsp;
who I mentor who just pop off

594
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,221
stupid stuff.&nbsp;
You know, talk about getting

595
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:57,225
some honey, or... smoking&nbsp;
something, drinking something.

596
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,228
>> Where are the teenage
girls?&nbsp;
Everyone laughs at all my jokes.

597
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:05,233
I knew going in that was
going&nbsp;
to be a huge bonus for me.

598
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,236
Because I'm not very
strong,&nbsp;
and I... I don't profess to be.

599
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,240
However, I'm a funny guy.&nbsp;
Trish, the dish!

600
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,244
You piss her off,&nbsp;
she be a bitch.

601
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,247
>> Jon is a goofball.&nbsp;
You can kind of get

602
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,249
the whole group laughing&nbsp;
and get it together.

603
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,251
I mean, which is great,&nbsp;
because we definitely need that

604
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,253
out here.&nbsp;
But I think at times,

605
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,256
he's a little obnoxious.&nbsp;
Anybody want this?

606
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,257
>> Yeah, I...&nbsp;
>> Yeah.

607
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,261
I'm going crazy!&nbsp;
>> He's out of control.

608
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,264
>> ( bleep ) you, man,&nbsp;
( bleep ) you!

609
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,266
>> I really can't stand
him.&nbsp;
He talks too much crap--

610
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,269
all night long, cursing.&nbsp;
He thinks it's cute,

611
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,271
but it isn't.&nbsp;
It gets old.

612
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,273
It's already old.&nbsp;
>> Whoo!

613
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,275
A girl in Vegas ( bleep ).&nbsp;
( laughter )

614
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,277
Hey.&nbsp;
>> Pass the bottle before you

615
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,281
drop it.&nbsp;
>> It's so sick, it was

616
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,158
( bleep ).&nbsp;
( laughs )

617
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,300
>> I don't think&nbsp;
this is ever going to dry.

618
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:18,306
Sleeping last night soaking
wet&nbsp;
really sucked.

619
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,310
Home would be so nice.&nbsp;
We did not purchase

620
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,312
any clothes in the
village.&nbsp;
We didn't think it was necessary

621
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,315
at the time.&nbsp;
>> Hey, girlie.

622
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,317
>> Out of all the things&nbsp;
that could happen,

623
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,319
I never thought that this&nbsp;
would be one of them, to just

624
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,322
have whatever you had on
and&nbsp;
that was it.

625
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,324
Man, I got to cut&nbsp;
these damn pants off.

626
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,327
( giggles )&nbsp;
I'm wearing my fancy,

627
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,329
my dress jeans.&nbsp;
Suckers were thick and hard and

628
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:47,335
heavy.&nbsp;
Them pants killed my crotch

629
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,338
where nice wet denim rubs&nbsp;
for a day and a half

630
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,341
and just starts eating&nbsp;
that skin away.

631
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,344
>> I do not want to wear&nbsp;
my sneakers today.

632
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,347
I want them to just dry&nbsp;
for once, just once.

633
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,307
>> Yeah.&nbsp;
>> A lot of us were pretty

634
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,351
miserable, but it was
like,&nbsp;
"Wait a second."

635
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,353
There's really a lot of
stuff&nbsp;
that you can do with just a

636
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,356
few pieces of clothing.&nbsp;
I can cut that seam right there

637
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,359
and make it a top and tie
it.&nbsp;
>> That could be a really

638
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,361
good top for you,
actually.&nbsp;
>> I can't tell you

639
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,363
how much better this
feels.&nbsp;
This wet thing has been

640
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:20,368
draping on me for days
now.&nbsp;
>> I can walk in these.

641
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,371
>> Finally making some
shorts.&nbsp;
>> Want me to cut it?

642
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,373
>> I'm wearing a nice
Armani&nbsp;
suit, but I had no choice--

643
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,376
they just had to come off.&nbsp;
Yeah, baby.

644
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,378
Beautiful.&nbsp;
( laughing )

645
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,381
>> As shorts, they dry in
half&nbsp;
the time, but I saved the

646
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,383
bottoms, 'cause I'm planning
on&nbsp;
making them into convertible

647
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,385
pants for the night.&nbsp;
>> We can get two skirts

648
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,387
out of this, and the bottom
part&nbsp;
will be big enough for you.

649
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,390
>> Okay.&nbsp;
Definitely.

650
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,393
My dress was falling
apart,&nbsp;
so we decided to go ahead

651
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:49,397
and improvise.&nbsp;
>> All right, chop her up.

652
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,400
We had a little fashion
club&nbsp;
meeting and took apart her

653
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,403
dress...&nbsp;
>> That is...

654
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,406
>> Oh, that is a skirt.&nbsp;
You hold this.

655
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:03,411
I want to put this on me
now.&nbsp;
>> Half of her dress is now

656
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,414
a skirt for Michelle...&nbsp;
and the other half is a skirt

657
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,417
for Blackbeard.&nbsp;
>> What do you think?

658
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,419
( all laughing )&nbsp;
>> My God, my thighs

659
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,422
feel so much better.&nbsp;
I got the little teasing

660
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,425
and laughing with the
girls&nbsp;
as we made it and I put it on

661
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,427
and I looked really silly.&nbsp;
It's done.

662
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,430
I'm wearing a dress.&nbsp;
I'm never gonna put

663
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:33,274
them pants back on.&nbsp;
>> Hey, you guys want to go

664
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:38,446
them pants back on.&nbsp;
>> Hey, you guys want to go

665
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,572
get some water?&nbsp;
>> Yeah...

666
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,449
>> Aren't we gonna look&nbsp;
and check our mail?

667
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,451
>> I thought we were gonna&nbsp;
all look for water first.

668
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,454
>> The biggest thing&nbsp;
that we need is water.

669
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,456
They say we'll go later for
the&nbsp;
water.

670
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:53,336
Personally...&nbsp;
we need to do it now.

671
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,466
Water well...&nbsp;
Oh, shut up.

672
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,427
Water well!&nbsp;
>> There's a water well

673
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,472
thing right on the map.&nbsp;
>> We were looking everywhere

674
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,475
for the water source,&nbsp;
not thinking, "Oh, let's look at

675
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,477
the map."&nbsp;
Water well is on our map.

676
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,478
>> Oh!&nbsp;
>> Oh!

677
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,481
>> Oh!&nbsp;
>> Nicely done.

678
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,484
>> Not just a pretty face.&nbsp;
>> Looked at the map, found

679
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,487
"Water well," so it&nbsp;
was exciting because we'd been

680
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,490
needing water for so long.&nbsp;
This is our boat.

681
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,492
>> It's a trail.&nbsp;
>> So, it's back here.

682
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,494
>> So... So we should just&nbsp;
follow that trail on back there.

683
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:31,499
>> Yeah, let's go get
water.&nbsp;
>> Why didn't we check the map

684
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,501
earlier?&nbsp;
That's what makes me angry.

685
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,503
>> Well, we were so busy
with&nbsp;
everything.

686
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,505
>> I know.&nbsp;
We need to kick ass

687
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:42,510
on that shelter.&nbsp;
Here's one of these bad boys.

688
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,512
>> Actually yesterday, we
built&nbsp;
a half A-frame up against a

689
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,514
shale wall.&nbsp;
It's actually pretty funny,

690
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,516
because I think&nbsp;
the shale wall was the home

691
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,518
to about 300 hermit crabs,&nbsp;
which paid us a visit

692
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,520
in the middle of the
night.&nbsp;
So, I thought we should

693
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,523
probably move our shelter,&nbsp;
so we're doing a little

694
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,524
penthouse suite here.&nbsp;
It's actually going

695
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,526
to have a floor.&nbsp;
We don't want to be

696
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,528
on the floor anymore,&nbsp;
so... where the crabs can get

697
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,530
us.&nbsp;
>> One of the biggest things in

698
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,532
my troop is we tuck our
shirts&nbsp;
in.

699
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,534
We look like a Scout,&nbsp;
we act like a Scout.

700
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,536
>> Yeah.&nbsp;
>> And here I'm running around

701
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,538
with my blouse open...&nbsp;
>> You know...

702
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,541
>> My shirt tied at the
waist.&nbsp;
( laughing )

703
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,543
I'm gonna come home and&nbsp;
they are going to razz me.

704
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,545
>> They're going to
critique&nbsp;
you.

705
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,547
>> Ooh, baby.&nbsp;
>> Lillian, I think I'm her,

706
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,881
probably her best friend&nbsp;
at the moment.

707
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,550
She kind of looks at the
other&nbsp;
girls as trying to be cute

708
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,552
and pretty and stuff.&nbsp;
And, uh, an-and me,

709
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,554
me and her go off&nbsp;
and have a good time

710
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,555
and talk and stuff.&nbsp;
( Lillian gasps )

711
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,558
>> Damn!&nbsp;
( screaming )

712
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,561
>> Yes!&nbsp;
>> Oh! You are wonderful!

713
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,563
>> We did it.&nbsp;
>> Oh! Oh!

714
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,567
Oh, how cool are you?&nbsp;
The one person who befriended

715
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,572
me with sincere friendship&nbsp;
was Ryan Shoulders.

716
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,574
Ryan's a good kid.&nbsp;
>> Yeah, I wish this stuff

717
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,576
was drinkable already.&nbsp;
>> I got an idea.

718
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,578
We ain't going to tell
them&nbsp;
where it's at.

719
00:38:50,661 --> 00:39:05,593
>> I was just thinking
that.&nbsp;
( snoring )

720
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,596
>> I'm a very active
person.&nbsp;
I don't like to sit around

721
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,599
doing absolutely nothing,&nbsp;
and we had this spear gun,

722
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,601
and I looked around, I was
like,&nbsp;
"Hey, guys, I think

723
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,603
I'm gonna go out."&nbsp;
>> Have you used it before?

724
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:26,614
>> Oh, yeah.&nbsp;
Shawn went with me, and we went

725
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,617
out and we were swimming
around&nbsp;
and got into this

726
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,622
huge mess of fish&nbsp;
just all over the place.

727
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,624
>> Burton had the spear at&nbsp;
first, then next thing

728
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:41,629
I know, he cocks it...&nbsp;
And, all of a sudden,

729
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,633
we got a fish.&nbsp;
( tribe cheering )

730
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,635
>> All right!&nbsp;
Nice work, guys.

731
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,928
>> You know, he's going to
be&nbsp;
tasty.

732
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,638
>> Yeah. He's a good fish.&nbsp;
>> He's going to be very tasty.

733
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,640
>> I'm so excited that,
you&nbsp;
know, all right, this thing

734
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,642
works; we can do this.&nbsp;
>> That is awesome.

735
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:59,647
>> Mmm.&nbsp;
>> It feels great to be able

736
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,649
to catch food, but I knew&nbsp;
that one fish just wasn't

737
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:07,530
going to be enough,&nbsp;
so I took the spear.

738
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,663
So, I start catching fish.&nbsp;
Oh, I got lunch!

739
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,666
>> Yeah!&nbsp;
Whoo-hoo!

740
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,669
>> After I got that,&nbsp;
I thought, "Okay, some more.

741
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,673
Some more."&nbsp;
>> Is that a catfish?

742
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,676
( women whooping )&nbsp;
>> I was thrilled.

743
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,678
I've never seen&nbsp;
a saltwater catfish.

744
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,683
I didn't know they made&nbsp;
such an animal.

745
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,686
>> You got another one?&nbsp;
>> Uh-huh.

746
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,690
>> He's going out again?&nbsp;
>> He's going to hurt himself.

747
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:47,695
>> Hey, Rupert.&nbsp;
Good job on those fish, man.

748
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:52,700
>> One, two, three, four,
five.&nbsp;
Three more.

749
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,703
>> Man, I hate to see
Rupert&nbsp;
out there.

750
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,871
Geez.&nbsp;
>> Wow, you're getting burned

751
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,707
on your shoulders, Rupert.&nbsp;
>> You look like you're

752
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,667
kind of getting red.&nbsp;
>> I got to the point

753
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,711
where I thought I was
going&nbsp;
to get eight of them.

754
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,713
Everybody was going&nbsp;
to get their own fish.

755
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,716
I didn't get eight,&nbsp;
but we got us fish.

756
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,717
>> You know what?&nbsp;
>> That's the best one

757
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,719
you caught, right there.&nbsp;
>> That one is.

758
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,887
>> No, the other one.&nbsp;
>> This guy?

759
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,722
I know if I could have
caught&nbsp;
more of these...

760
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,724
>> No, not that one, the&nbsp;
other one.

761
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,808
That one.&nbsp;
>> That one's a good one.

762
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,893
>> That's the best.&nbsp;
>> Rupert's definitely

763
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,729
a huge asset.&nbsp;
I mean, he worked his ass off,

764
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,731
but he was beat.&nbsp;
I mean, it took him hours to

765
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,734
recover from that.&nbsp;
>> Man, you are red.

766
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,738
>> I... I am burning up.&nbsp;
I had a great day.

767
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,742
I don't know if I can&nbsp;
keep up the workload

768
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,745
that I'm putting on
myself,&nbsp;
but that's what I told myself

769
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,747
I was going to do.&nbsp;
I'm coming out here

770
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,749
to be the caretaker.&nbsp;
I'm trying to make these people

771
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,752
believe that there is&nbsp;
no way you can get along without

772
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,756
me, and I think I'm doing
it.&nbsp;
>> Compliments to the catcher

773
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,758
today.&nbsp;
>> Absolutely.

774
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,759
>> Everyone did great.&nbsp;
>> Everybody.

775
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,636
>> Everyone did great.&nbsp;
>> There's mail.

776
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,785
>> Dude, it's our first
mail.&nbsp;
I guess, let's bring

777
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,787
it back and show them.&nbsp;
>> Great.

778
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,790
We have tree mail!&nbsp;
>> We got tree mail!

779
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,792
>> Mail, fools.&nbsp;
>> Whoo!

780
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,793
Read it out loud.&nbsp;
>> Read it out loud.

781
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,795
>> It's on.&nbsp;
>> Here we go. Here we go.

782
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,797
>>"You finally arrived&nbsp;
and so now it's on.

783
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,800
"Your first challenge is a
test&nbsp;
of your brains and your brawn.

784
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,804
"Like pirates of old,&nbsp;
it's the treasure you thirst.

785
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,807
But no booty will be had&nbsp;
if you're voted out first."

786
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,809
>> You know what booty that
is.&nbsp;
( all laughing )

787
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,811
>> Hey, I was thinking&nbsp;
for this challenge, seriously,

788
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,813
the challenge probably
won't&nbsp;
last very long.

789
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,817
So, if we just focus&nbsp;
for whatever, 15, 20 minutes...

790
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,819
>> The very first moment&nbsp;
Andrew gave the presence

791
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,822
of a leader, nobody
challenged&nbsp;
it.

792
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,073
>> Should we maybe...&nbsp;
>> Everything, everything...

793
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,825
>> ...appoint a leader?&nbsp;
Someone that just calls the

794
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,827
shots, so we don't get
stuck&nbsp;
fighting?

795
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,787
It makes no difference&nbsp;
to me who it is, but...

796
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,831
>> We need you.&nbsp;
>> Yeah, Andrew.

797
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,833
>> I made a suggestion
just&nbsp;
because I knew I didn't want

798
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,836
to be the leader, uh, but I
knew&nbsp;
that we needed somebody,

799
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,839
so we appointed Andrew&nbsp;
ahead of time as our leader

800
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,841
before the challenge.&nbsp;
>> Let's do it now, then.

801
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,843
Let's go out there.&nbsp;
>> The Morgan Tribe, I think,

802
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,846
is very ready for the
challenge.&nbsp;
Biggest concern from my

803
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:23,851
standpoint, from our tribe
is,&nbsp;
uh, Osten was having difficulty

804
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,853
with his shorts&nbsp;
last couple of days,

805
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,979
staying up.&nbsp;
The crack of his bottom

806
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,858
kept showing, and we said,&nbsp;
during any activity

807
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,860
against the other tribe,&nbsp;
if his shorts go down,

808
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,863
Ryan and I told him&nbsp;
that, uh, we're a team,

809
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,866
we're a family, and we
won't&nbsp;
make him embarrassed by being

810
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,745
nude, so, we'll, uh, do
the&nbsp;
same.

811
00:43:53,964 --> 00:44:06,894
>> PROBST: Come on in,
guys!&nbsp;
Everybody good?

812
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,897
Let's get to today's
challenge.&nbsp;
One of the things

813
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,900
the pirates had to do&nbsp;
with all the loot that they

814
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,902
plundered is protect it.&nbsp;
So, that often meant moving

815
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,906
from one island to another,
and,&nbsp;
in the process, they would have

816
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,908
to transport their
artillery.&nbsp;
That's what you guys

817
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,910
are going to do today.&nbsp;
You're going to transport

818
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,912
the cannons behind you&nbsp;
through a series of obstacles

819
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:28,916
along a jungle course.&nbsp;
First, you're going to take

820
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,918
apart your cannon&nbsp;
and get it through two fences

821
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,920
blocking the path.&nbsp;
Next, you'll hit the rock

822
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,923
garden, where you'll have
to&nbsp;
clear a path to move your cannon

823
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,926
forward to the third
obstacle,&nbsp;
where you're going to have to

824
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,930
push, pull and drag your
cannon&nbsp;
through a mud pit blocked by

825
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,933
wooden barriers.&nbsp;
Finally, it's a race along

826
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,936
the shoreline to the
finish.&nbsp;
One person will carry the tribe

827
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,354
flag.&nbsp;
One person will carry the torch.

828
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,941
First tribe to reach the
finish&nbsp;
line with all eight members and

829
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,943
their cannon intact wins&nbsp;
immunity.

830
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:56,944
Want to get a look&nbsp;
at the immunity idol?

831
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,946
>> Yeah.&nbsp;
>> Yeah.

832
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,907
>> PROBST: The most
valuable&nbsp;
thing in your 39 days is this

833
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,951
right here.&nbsp;
>> Yeah!

834
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,954
( applause )&nbsp;
Okay.

835
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,957
Big enough stakes.&nbsp;
Win this challenge, you're here

836
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,960
three more days, you are
safe.&nbsp;
Lose, somebody from your tribe

837
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,963
will be the first person&nbsp;
voted out at Tribal Council.

838
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,047
Give you a couple of minutes
to&nbsp;
strategize.

839
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:24,972
Wait for my "go."&nbsp;
Here we go, for immunity.

840
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:29,852
Survivors ready?&nbsp;
Go!

841
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,980
>> Go!&nbsp;
( indistinct voices )

842
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:40,988
>> Go! Go!&nbsp;
>> Move it, move it, move it!

843
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,991
>> Come on.&nbsp;
We're right behind them.

844
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:57,004
>> Yeah.&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Drake out to an early

845
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:10,017
lead.&nbsp;
>> We've got to take this apart.

846
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,019
That's the only thing...&nbsp;
>> Apart!

847
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,021
>> PROBST: Guys, you're going
to&nbsp;
have to take apart your cannons

848
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,023
to get it through the
fence.&nbsp;
>> Just push it.

849
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,025
Pull the cart all the way
up.&nbsp;
>> Watch your feet!

850
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,027
This thing's going to
fall.&nbsp;
>> Watch your feet!

851
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,029
>> Watch your feet!&nbsp;
Break it up!

852
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,031
>> PROBST: All wheels are
gonna&nbsp;
have to come off to get through

853
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,033
there.&nbsp;
Once everybody's through, you

854
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,035
can move through the other
one.&nbsp;
Let's go, Morgan!

855
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,037
You're falling behind.&nbsp;
>> Here we go.

856
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,038
Ready?&nbsp;
One, two, three.

857
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,041
Lift ya up.&nbsp;
>> Okay, let's go.

858
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,042
>> Ho-Hold on. Hold on.&nbsp;
Hold back!

859
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,045
( indistinct shouts )&nbsp;
All right!

860
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,047
Go!&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Drake through first,

861
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:44,051
still in the lead.&nbsp;
>> Walk it. Walk it.

862
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,054
>> Okay.&nbsp;
>> Let's rock and roll.

863
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:55,062
>> Go!&nbsp;
>> Get that log! Get that log!

864
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,064
>> Okay.&nbsp;
This?

865
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:01,068
We got to move this.&nbsp;
>> All the rocks?

866
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,027
Dude, we can't move&nbsp;
all those rocks.

867
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,071
>> Yeah.&nbsp;
>> We're not gonna get...

868
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:09,076
( indistinct voices )&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Let's go, Drake!

869
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:14,081
Got Morgan on your heels.&nbsp;
Ryan and Osten talking strategy.

870
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:19,086
>> My shorts?&nbsp;
( indistinct voices )

871
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:23,090
>> PROBST: What are you
guys&nbsp;
doing?

872
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,094
Osten, you are a first,&nbsp;
my man-- a totally nude

873
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,097
challenge.&nbsp;
We have two naked Morgan

874
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,101
members, and they are not&nbsp;
the guys anybody wants to see.

875
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,104
>> They better hope they
don't&nbsp;
lose their weenies out here.

876
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,107
>> Move some rocks, jerks!&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Great.

877
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:46,113
Now Andrew's naked.&nbsp;
>> Let's go, guys!

878
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:52,119
>> PROBST: Game is back
on!&nbsp;
You got a long way

879
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:59,126
left, guys.&nbsp;
It's going to be a great race.

880
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:05,132
( indistinct voices )&nbsp;
>> Run around and clear it!

881
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,134
>> PROBST: Drake still in
the&nbsp;
lead-- still controlling

882
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,136
the pace.&nbsp;
>> Go! Go! Go!

883
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,137
>> Go!

884
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,138
>> If you guys can

885
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,141
get out of the way
( indistinct shouts )

886
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:18,145
>> Push it! Push it!&nbsp;
>> Right, right, left, left!

887
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:23,150
>> Look out.&nbsp;
>> Go right ahead.

888
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,152
>> Good.&nbsp;
Come on, guys, push. Push.

889
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:29,156
( groaning )&nbsp;
( indistinct voices )

890
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,159
( grunting )&nbsp;
Watch out! Watch out. Watch out.

891
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,161
Come through. Come
through.&nbsp;
>> Let's go, let's go!

892
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:38,165
Let's go, let's go!&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Let's go, Morgan!

893
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:44,046
Keep it up!&nbsp;
( indistinct shouts )

894
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,176
>> Let's go!&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Through the flags!

895
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:55,182
Through the flags!&nbsp;
The cannons are heavy, guys.

896
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,266
They are going to&nbsp;
drag in the sand.

897
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,185
You're gonna have to&nbsp;
work hard to make it to

898
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,187
the finish.&nbsp;
Let's go, Drake!

899
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:04,191
Don't waste this lead!&nbsp;
Drake is bogged down.

900
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,193
>> Come on, we can do it!&nbsp;
We're beating 'em.

901
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,195
>> Come on, pull!&nbsp;
Watch out, guys!

902
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,198
>> Come on, Morgan!&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Keep going!

903
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:16,203
Morgan's taken the lead!&nbsp;
>> Push, push, push.

904
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:23,210
Come on, Morgan!&nbsp;
( indistinct shouting )

905
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:28,215
>> PROBST: It's a sprint to
the&nbsp;
finish!

906
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,217
First tribe across&nbsp;
with all eight members

907
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,223
and their cannon together&nbsp;
wins immunity.

908
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:40,227
Now Morgan's bogged down.&nbsp;
Here comes Drake,

909
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,230
back in the lead!&nbsp;
Down to the finish!

910
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,232
Got to get&nbsp;
through here!

911
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,234
Through here, Jon!&nbsp;
Through here!

912
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,238
( indistinct shouting )&nbsp;
>> Get up! Push!

913
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,240
( yelling )&nbsp;
>> Get up, get up!

914
00:49:53,323 --> 00:50:00,247
Get up!&nbsp;
( indistinct shouts )

915
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:09,256
>> PROBST: Drake wins
immunity!&nbsp;
Oh, my God.

916
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,258
Drake!&nbsp;
>> And we didn't even

917
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,260
have to get naked!&nbsp;
>> Whoo!

918
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,262
>> PROBST: Drake!&nbsp;
>> Here we go!

919
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,265
( cheering )&nbsp;
Wins immunity.

920
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,268
Congratulations.&nbsp;
>> ( chanting ): Drake! Drake!

921
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,271
Drake! Drake! Drake!
Drake!&nbsp;
Drake! Drake! Drake!

922
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:29,276
( cheering )&nbsp;
>> Sweet!

923
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,278
>> PROBST: Morgan, great
effort,&nbsp;
down to the end.

924
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,281
Unfortunately, it wasn't
enough.&nbsp;
Next time I see you,

925
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,283
it'll be Tribal Council.&nbsp;
Somebody's going home.

926
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:40,162
You have the night&nbsp;
to think about it.

927
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,304
>> Drake!&nbsp;
>> I think it looks so pretty on

928
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,307
there.&nbsp;
>> When they passed us...

929
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,267
>> Oh, dude...&nbsp;
>> ...I was ready to puke and

930
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,312
cry.&nbsp;
>> When we won that challenge,

931
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,315
we beat them not on brute&nbsp;
strength alone, but we beat

932
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,317
them on... on, basically,
in&nbsp;
my opinion, willpower.

933
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,319
They gave up.&nbsp;
And we didn't.

934
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,321
You know, we almost did, but
we&nbsp;
didn't.

935
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,323
And I think that's why&nbsp;
we made it to the end.

936
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,325
Dude, just too many&nbsp;
naked men behind us.

937
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,328
>> At the immunity
challenge,&nbsp;
I looked back and I saw one guy

938
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,331
with his junk just hanging
out&nbsp;
just like, you know,

939
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,332
nobody's business.&nbsp;
And that...

940
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,335
I was like, "Whoa!&nbsp;
I shouldn't be looking."

941
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,337
Their asses were in my
face.&nbsp;
>> Yeah!

942
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,341
So just say you looked.&nbsp;
>> Did you enjoy it?

943
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,343
>> I wasn't impressed.&nbsp;
I don't know what

944
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,344
was going on with them.&nbsp;
I wish their ding-a-lings

945
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,347
got stuck on a vine&nbsp;
or I don't know.

946
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,350
That was just stupid.&nbsp;
>> Do you know why the boys

947
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,434
took their panties off?&nbsp;
>> Dude, I have no idea.

948
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,353
>> Did you enjoy it?&nbsp;
>> When I turned around

949
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,356
and saw them idiots&nbsp;
bouncing around naked

950
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:53,360
in the mud and the muck&nbsp;
and the stickers and the thorns,

951
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,363
( chuckles ): it was
hilarious.&nbsp;
>> The coolest thing is,

952
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,364
thank God, we don't&nbsp;
have to send anyone home

953
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,365
tonight.&nbsp;
>> Yeah.

954
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,449
>>'Cause that would have&nbsp;
sucked.

955
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:11,378
>> Exactly right.&nbsp;
>> You know, that sucked,

956
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,382
any way you look at it.&nbsp;
We lost by about a foot.

957
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,385
We learn from it.&nbsp;
We move on, and we kick

958
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:22,389
their butt the next time.&nbsp;
And we remember how cocky

959
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:28,270
they were when they won.&nbsp;
All right?

960
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,399
>> Hey, guys.&nbsp;
We were just talking

961
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,567
and just thinking about...&nbsp;
>> You were?

962
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,402
What were you talking
about?&nbsp;
>> We were...

963
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,405
we were just thinking
about,&nbsp;
obviously, tonight.

964
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,408
>> You ladies saw what we
saw.&nbsp;
>> What did you see?

965
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,410
>> I saw our friend Ryan,&nbsp;
who's back at the camp,

966
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,413
just quit about a third&nbsp;
of the way in.

967
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,415
And every time I looked&nbsp;
over, he said, "What?"

968
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:52,419
It's like...&nbsp;
>> With Lilly, I mean,

969
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,421
she works hard when it comes
to&nbsp;
the fire and the water,

970
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,424
but we all can do fire and&nbsp;
water.

971
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,426
>> I think it's a big
mistake&nbsp;
if we expect other challenges

972
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,552
to be less strenuous.&nbsp;
>> Yeah!

973
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,430
>> So, the question is,&nbsp;
is Lilly up for that

974
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:07,434
or are we better off&nbsp;
with the limp noodle, Ryan?

975
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,436
>> But I don't fit in&nbsp;
here with the girls.

976
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,439
I don't fit in with the
boys.&nbsp;
>> Hang in there.

977
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:16,443
This thing changes every
day.&nbsp;
>> I took the challenge loss,

978
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:20,447
I think, the hardest,&nbsp;
because I feel like I am...

979
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,450
going to be encouraged to
leave.&nbsp;
( chuckles )

980
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,453
>> When your torch goes
out,&nbsp;
then give up.

981
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,456
>> All right.&nbsp;
>>'Cause it's over then.

982
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,458
( Lillian sighs )&nbsp;
>> But not until then.

983
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,462
>> I think my teammates like
me,&nbsp;
but someone has to go.

984
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,464
>> Do you want to try and
crack&nbsp;
one of them?

985
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:42,469
>> No one else has said
"Side&nbsp;
with me," other than Nicole.

986
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,472
>> Uh... Lill, I think&nbsp;
Tijuana is the person

987
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,474
that I think needs to&nbsp;
be taken care of quickly.

988
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,477
And, at this point, while
we're&nbsp;
still building the shelter,

989
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,478
we don't want to get&nbsp;
rid of any of the guys.

990
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,480
( chuckles )&nbsp;
Truth... truth be told,

991
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,484
I like all of them.&nbsp;
>> Nicole came to me, and...

992
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:04,491
she wants to get rid of
Tijuana.&nbsp;
You know, okay.

993
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,493
You know, why?&nbsp;
Well, this is...

994
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:10,497
this is what went on for
me.&nbsp;
Nicole comes to me, she tells

995
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,499
me, "Let's get rid of
Tijuana."&nbsp;
>> What?

996
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,502
That's a hell of a
strategy.&nbsp;
She says she's bugging her...

997
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,504
da da da.&nbsp;
"Will you help me?"

998
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:22,509
And I'm going, geez, you
know,&nbsp;
that didn't sound too cool.

999
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,511
>> Lilly...&nbsp;
I had... had some conversations

1000
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,513
with her, and I believe&nbsp;
everything she says.

1001
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,516
I don't think she has&nbsp;
a dishonest bone in her body.

1002
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,520
Lill said Nicole came to
her&nbsp;
and said, "Will you

1003
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,523
form an alliance&nbsp;
"with me to vote off...

1004
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,732
>> Are you serious?&nbsp;
>> Tijua..." Wait, wait.

1005
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,527
...to vote off Tijuana."&nbsp;
>> Nicole approached Lilly

1006
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,529
because Tijuana was
apparently&nbsp;
being too bossy and was

1007
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,531
annoying Nicole.&nbsp;
>> Are you serious?

1008
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,534
>> They're saying, too...&nbsp;
>> She told me that Lill went

1009
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,952
to her.&nbsp;
So she blamed it on Lill,

1010
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,539
and it's Nicole that's doing
it.&nbsp;
>> Lill has not denied it.

1011
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,542
Lill just tells you the
truth.&nbsp;
We're just trying to figure out

1012
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,545
who said what to whom
and...&nbsp;
and whether Nicole can be

1013
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,546
trusted.&nbsp;
>> Ooh! Ooh!

1014
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,507
That pisses me off.&nbsp;
What I had to do

1015
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,552
is find out is Nicole
lying.&nbsp;
Was she really trying to put me

1016
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,554
on the cutting block?&nbsp;
I really believe that she was.

1017
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,556
I think Lill...&nbsp;
I just don't think she has a

1018
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,559
reason to lie.&nbsp;
>> All I want to know is who's

1019
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,810
backstabbing me.&nbsp;
I don't have any...

1020
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,562
>> Nobody's backstabbing
you.&nbsp;
Nobody's voting for you.

1021
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,564
>> Somebody obviously is.&nbsp;
>> How?

1022
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,566
I did talk to Lillian&nbsp;
to get rid of Tijuana,

1023
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,568
but word got out of that&nbsp;
because Lill's freaked out that

1024
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,570
she's getting voted off
tonight,&nbsp;
so she's telling everybody.

1025
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,572
I set myself up&nbsp;
in a really bad position,

1026
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,574
telling some truths,&nbsp;
telling some half-truths

1027
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,575
and trying to get things&nbsp;
to go my way.

1028
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,577
She approached me.&nbsp;
>> Somebody's lying.

1029
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,580
It's either Lill or it's
you.&nbsp;
And that's not a good thing,

1030
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,583
because who knows when
you're&nbsp;
going to be talked about or

1031
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,585
lied about?&nbsp;
>> I was getting along

1032
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,587
with Nicole there&nbsp;
for a little while,

1033
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,588
which I still am.&nbsp;
But, you know, now I don't know

1034
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,964
if I can trust her.&nbsp;
>> Okay.

1035
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,592
>> You've made me feel
very&nbsp;
uncomfortable in this situation.

1036
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,594
>> But you're not
listening.&nbsp;
He told me.

1037
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,596
I didn't create it.&nbsp;
He told me, so I came

1038
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,598
directly to you.&nbsp;
I didn't want to make a

1039
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,640
judgment call.&nbsp;
>> And then you would go and...

1040
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,601
I wanted to ask you.&nbsp;
I wanted to ask you.

1041
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,602
>> If you don't trust me,&nbsp;
and if you think I'm out

1042
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,728
to get people...&nbsp;
>> I want to trust you.

1043
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,605
>> ...why would you want&nbsp;
to have an alliance?

1044
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,608
>> That's why I'm asking
you.&nbsp;
As far as Nicole, I think it is

1045
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,776
enemy status.&nbsp;
It's gotten to that point.

1046
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,611
I can't trust her.&nbsp;
So, yeah, she's definitely an

1047
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,613
enemy.&nbsp;
She came right off the bat

1048
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,615
trying to take me down.&nbsp;
For what purposes?

1049
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:13,620
For what?&nbsp;
>> The people that I

1050
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,623
think are at risk?&nbsp;
>> You're hungry, aren't you?

1051
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,791
>> Skinny Ryan.&nbsp;
I don't...

1052
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,626
he just hasn't been&nbsp;
pulling his weight at camp

1053
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,628
or at the challenge.&nbsp;
>> Well, we gotta go.

1054
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,631
>> Nicole, with the high
drama&nbsp;
today, she's been labeled in

1055
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,634
some people's eyes as
being&nbsp;
dishonest.

1056
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,637
And, uh, so her neck's&nbsp;
on the line, because we don't

1057
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,640
know if we can trust her.&nbsp;
And Lilly, is her neck

1058
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,643
on the chopping block?&nbsp;
Yeah, she's

1059
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,521
definitely, uh, a
contender&nbsp;
to be voted out tonight.

00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:53,720
Welcome to your first&nbsp;
Tribal Council,

1068
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,723
not the place you want to
be.&nbsp;
But, uh, before we get

1069
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,726
to the vote, let's talk
about&nbsp;
the challenge, the reason you

1070
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,687
guys are here tonight.&nbsp;
It's one thing to get naked

1071
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:06,733
for no apparent reason and
win,&nbsp;
but it's another thing entirely

1072
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,736
to have three guys walking&nbsp;
around naked and lose a

1073
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,739
challenge.&nbsp;
Any regrets about that?

1074
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,741
>> Absolutely not.&nbsp;
Not a regret.

1075
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,742
What's in the past&nbsp;
is in the past.

1076
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:20,747
We did it and we move on,&nbsp;
period.

1077
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,749
>> PROBST: So, how has it
been,&nbsp;
Ryan?

1078
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,752
How are the first three
days&nbsp;
of getting along with these

1079
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,754
people that you didn't
know?&nbsp;
The first three days has

1080
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:31,758
been good for me.&nbsp;
I... I get along with everybody.

1081
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,760
Everybody's really cool,&nbsp;
everybody's really helpful,

1082
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,763
but... food, I could care
less&nbsp;
about.

1083
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:40,767
The water aspect, I'm
struggling&nbsp;
a little bit.

1084
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,768
>> PROBST: Andrew, has
water&nbsp;
been the toughest part?

1085
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,770
>> No. Uh...&nbsp;
I'm very...

1086
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,772
I'm hydrated.&nbsp;
For me, it's the sleep.

1087
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,774
I haven't had more&nbsp;
than 45 minutes sleep

1088
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,777
the last three nights.&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Why?

1089
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:55,782
>> Well, we built a
fashionable&nbsp;
hut, and we put a floor down.

1090
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,785
And the poles were uneven,&nbsp;
so that didn't work very well.

1091
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,787
So, we didn't quite get&nbsp;
the job done.

1092
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,747
>> PROBST: Lill, you're a&nbsp;
scoutmaster, right?

1093
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,791
I mean, the...&nbsp;
it's not just decorative.

1094
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,794
>> No. It... it's
hard-earned.&nbsp;
It's 11 years of being

1095
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,798
scoutmaster of, um, troop
617&nbsp;
in Cincinnati, Ohio.

1096
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,800
>> PROBST: And has that
served&nbsp;
you well out here?

1097
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:18,805
>> It has served me well.&nbsp;
It has also given me patience.

1098
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,807
Uh, you can't work with&nbsp;
a bunch of young children

1099
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:27,814
without having patience,
so...&nbsp;
I'm patient.

1100
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,816
>> PROBST: Let's talk
about&nbsp;
friendships.

1101
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,818
How about you, Nicole?&nbsp;
Friendships out here?

1102
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,821
Um, I think I have some
social&nbsp;
friendships, but I don't...

1103
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,823
I think it's too early to
trust&nbsp;
anybody.

1104
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,825
I've already seen several
sides&nbsp;
of a few people.

1105
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,827
Just when questioned&nbsp;
or when threatened,

1106
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,829
I've seen people that are&nbsp;
normally very cheerful

1107
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,832
and very positive&nbsp;
turn very defensive.

1108
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,835
Um, having me feel funny,
that&nbsp;
was from the very first day.

1109
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,839
>> PROBST: Has anybody
emerged&nbsp;
as a leader that... that you

1110
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,841
guys are looking to now to&nbsp;
make decisions?

1111
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,844
Lill?&nbsp;
>> Um...

1112
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,847
Andrew is our leader.&nbsp;
We've elected him as a team,

1113
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,850
and he's done an excellent
job.&nbsp;
He's willing to listen

1114
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,853
to each one of us, and I
like&nbsp;
that in leadership.

1115
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,855
>> PROBST: Andrew, as the&nbsp;
leader, anybody here not

1116
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,858
pulling their weight?&nbsp;
>> Young Ryan.

1117
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,860
At the challenge,&nbsp;
we were side by side, I'm

1118
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,863
pulling the left-hand
side,&nbsp;
and he didn't wake up

1119
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,865
and show me the passion
that&nbsp;
we needed.

1120
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,868
So... yeah, I don't think he
was&nbsp;
pulling his weight.

1121
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,870
>> PROBST: So, Ryan, first
three&nbsp;
days, you been pulling your

1122
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,873
weight?&nbsp;
>> I know there has been some

1123
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:31,878
talk among some people&nbsp;
that I didn't give my 110%

1124
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:32,879
at the, uh, at the
immunity&nbsp;
challenge.

1125
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,882
And I thought I was giving&nbsp;
120%.

1126
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,883
If they see me otherwise,&nbsp;
that's fine.

1127
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,885
We'll go on.&nbsp;
>> PROBST: Okay.

1128
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:43,765
It is time to vote.&nbsp;
Nicole, you're up first.

1129
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,902
>> Ryan S., I'm voting for
you&nbsp;
because you're the only person

1130
01:00:55,985 --> 01:01:00,782
I know other people are
planning&nbsp;
to vote for.

1131
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,928
>> Nicole, you stabbed me
in&nbsp;
the back.

1132
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:27,809
Fortunately, I found out&nbsp;
and I was able to save myself.

1133
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,834
>> PROBST: I'll go tally
the&nbsp;
votes.

1134
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,973
Once the votes are read,&nbsp;
the decision is final.

1135
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,975
The person voted out will
be&nbsp;
asked to leave the Tribal

1136
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:13,855
Council area immediately.&nbsp;
I'll read the votes.

1137
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:20,862
First vote...&nbsp;
Nicole.

1138
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:30,872
Ryan S.&nbsp;
One vote Ryan, one vote Nicole.

1139
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:37,879
Nicole.&nbsp;
Two votes Nicole, one vote Ryan.

1140
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:47,013
Three votes Nicole.&nbsp;
Nicole.

1141
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:53,019
That's four votes Nicole.&nbsp;
The first person voted out

1142
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:56,022
of the Pearl Islands,&nbsp;
Nicole.

1143
01:02:56,105 --> 01:03:08,910
You need to bring me your
torch.&nbsp;
Nicole, the tribe has spoken.

1144
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:22,048
It's time for you to go.&nbsp;
Judging from tonight's

1145
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,051
Tribal Council, it's clear&nbsp;
a couple of you certainly

1146
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,053
thought that could have
been&nbsp;
your torch.

1147
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,055
So, maybe the thing&nbsp;
to be learned is that you are

1148
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:34,060
not out of this game until&nbsp;
your torch is snuffed.

1149
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,063
Keep that in your head&nbsp;
over the next 36 days.

1150
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,065
You can always save
yourself.&nbsp;
Grab your torches,

1151
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:43,945
head back to camp.&nbsp;
Good night.

from our next episode.

1156
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:09,095
>> PROBST: Next time on&nbsp;
Survivor: At Drake, life is good

1157
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,097
until Shawn causes Rupert&nbsp;
to lose his cool.

1158
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,101
>> That's why I wanted to be
the&nbsp;
only one... who did that.

1159
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:18,104
( yells )&nbsp;
And a member of the Morgan

1160
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,107
Tribe wants to quit.&nbsp;
>> We don't need people just

1161
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,108
walking around, "I
don't...&nbsp;
I want to go home."

1162
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,987
It's a real morale killer&nbsp;
for the tribe.

1163
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,119
>> I knew going in that&nbsp;
my biggest weakness

1164
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,120
was going to be keeping&nbsp;
my mouth shut.

1165
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,122
When I have an opinion&nbsp;
about somebody,

1166
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,290
I just can't seem&nbsp;
to keep it in.

1167
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,126
Um, based on past
experiences&nbsp;
in my life,

1168
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,128
it doesn't surprise me&nbsp;
that I'm sitting here.

1169
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,130
Um, I knew I'd either be&nbsp;
the first person off

1170
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,132
or the person that won.&nbsp;
So, it was one of the toughest

1171
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,134
things I've ever done.&nbsp;
And, even with a million

1172
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,136
dollars at stake,&nbsp;
I still had to say what I

1173
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,138
thought when I thought it.&nbsp;
And that's exactly

1174
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,514
what did me in.&nbsp;
I sort of shot myself

1175
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,142
in the foot by trying to
make&nbsp;
an alliance early on to get rid

1176
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,144
of someone that was just&nbsp;
annoying me, um, which I see

1177
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:03,024
now in hindsight is probably
not&nbsp;
the best way to play the game.
