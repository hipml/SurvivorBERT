1
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:04,267
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,163 --> 00:00:06,915
After the merger,

3
00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:09,967
the war 
between Domenick and Chris broke out.

4
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:11,787
It's the arms race.

5
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:14,518
These two can 
blow it all up if they want to.

6
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:17,463
But Angela and Desiree 
had their own target.

7
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:23,604
Naviti girls can date 
who I want to date. Libby.

8
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:26,835
At the council,

9
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:29,438
Domenick bluffed 
with his fake idol...

10
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:32,774
I'm going to put it on, because... 
It's the shell.

11
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,891
...and played the Heir Advantage.

12
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:36,667
I play it for me.

13
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:41,142
Libby received votes, 
but Chris was sent to the jury.

14
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,867
Chris, the tribe has spoken.

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,354
Thank you, Probst.

16
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:49,663
There are 13 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

17
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:00,767
Let's light this fire.

18
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,140
First council of the merger!

19
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,001
It's nothing!

20
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:08,710
Very delirious, huh!

21
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:12,567
But who voted for you?

22
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,367
I do not know.

23
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,767
No idea.

24
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:21,567
It's been three tips in a row 
that my name comes out.

25
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:23,642
And I don't know why.

26
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:27,598
Emotionally, you wonder 
what people have in mind.

27
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:29,638
But whatever I do

28
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:32,759
I have to make mistakes 
to be noticed like this.

29
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:36,501
So I have to keep my eyes open,

30
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:39,274
looking for something 
to help me a little.

31
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,076
I liked the shell necklace!

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,142
This guy wouldn't let me go.

33
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:47,382
What a relief 
to finally be free from Chris!

34
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:51,051
It had been so long. 
I can die in peace.

35
00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:52,665
He was after me.

36
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:56,229
I'm not jubilant tonight. 
I respect Chris a lot.

37
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:58,920
I know I did 
the show, but...

38
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,989
I am not proud of myself.

39
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:04,618
What worries me 
after my performance on the board,

40
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:08,466
it's that they think I'm 
as dangerous as Chris thought I was.

41
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,400
I didn't mean to 
sound pretentious or arrogant.

42
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:13,742
To do that is to become the target.

43
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,632
But if I can take a step back,

44
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:19,642
not be at the maneuver 
these next few days,

45
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,542
I will have a little more flexibility 
with them.

46
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,703
Besides, I still have 
my real idol in my pocket,

47
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:28,534
and that's good, 
because the war is anything but over.

48
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:48,809
Wendell cooks.

49
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,967
The advice went 
as we wanted.

50
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,307
Chris finally left, 
almost unanimously.

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,457
But the sequel 
is much less easy to predict.

52
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,864
There are so many discussions.

53
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,267
Everyone talks to everyone.

54
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:10,547
So my plan 
is to stick to the four

55
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,567
which no one knows anything about.

56
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:16,542
Me, Domenick, Laurel and Donathan.

57
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,767
And we go from there.

58
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,397
How are you ? 
Yes.

59
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,373
You seem far away.

60
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,644
Of you ? 
Yeah.

61
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,842
No, it rolls. 
Yeah ?

62
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,839
I would tell you otherwise. You know.

63
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,573
I base many of my actions

64
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,691
on non-verbal elements.

65
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,974
I sensed Laurel a little hesitant.

66
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,942
She can be a bit paranoid.

67
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,500
So the safer she feels,

68
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,478
the better it is for our alliance.

69
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:49,042
So you know Dom has an idol?

70
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,142
Does he have a real one? 
Yes.

71
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,042
This shell is a decoy.

72
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,151
I haven't seen it, but I believe it.

73
00:03:57,276 --> 00:04:00,342
She is at our disposal.

74
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:03,842
We can go to the end. 
I am with you.

75
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,342
If we are a close-knit quartet... 
There are no others.

76
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,342
Are you 1000% top four with me?

77
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,286
Yes. At 1000%.

78
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:18,442
I don't want to work 
with anyone else. Know the.

79
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,542
OK. I promise you 
we're going to the top four together.

80
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,136
I also have an idol.

81
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,313
There, I know you're lying. Why ?

82
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,491
Why shouldn't I have one?

83
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,642
You would have told me before.

84
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:35,250
Domenick and Wendell have a lot 
of power and influence.

85
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,686
And now 
he tells me he has an idol.

86
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,842
I have once again been 
left out, and I don't like it.

87
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:45,767
And of course, Dom hadn't told me 
about the Heir's Advantage.

88
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:48,630
It's frustrating 
that they still have something,

89
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:51,542
additional power.

90
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,742
You are the second to know.

91
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:56,342
I didn't tell anyone. 
I'm telling you...

92
00:04:56,467 --> 00:05:00,642
Wendell and I 
tell each other every day that we cover ourselves 100%.

93
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,272
But he has shown to be loyal 
only up to a point.

94
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,113
I'm hallucinating here.

95
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,539
Yeah. This is...

96
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,107
There, I downed my game.

97
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,432
Four people, two idols.

98
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:17,667
There is no more powerful. 
Let's eliminate the others.

99
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:18,967
Yeah. 
Good.

100
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:21,705
I distrust what Wendell tells me,

101
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:24,542
because he and Dom 
share too much power.

102
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,442
She is 1000% with us. 
Good.

103
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:31,318
At some point, I will have to shake 
the coconut tree, change something.

104
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:35,667
Because after the merger, 
you have to start making moves.

105
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:49,615
Over here, everyone!

106
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:02,797
Ready for 
today's reward event?

107
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:06,935
Today 
you will form two teams of six.

108
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,030
On my signal, 
you will cross a pontoon bridge

109
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,816
up to a slingshot.

110
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:15,310
With, you will send sandbags

111
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,442
to targets.

112
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:21,217
The first team 
to take down all six targets

113
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:22,837
win the reward.

114
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:25,360
Want to know what's at stake? 
Yes !

115
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,260
The six winners will enjoy 
an afternoon... of tacos...

116
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,567
...of burritos,

117
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,537
of quesadillas...

118
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,053
Damn it ! 
My God !

119
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:37,640
... and about the pearls...

120
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,044
...in Survivor's taco shack .

121
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:46,302
Also, the winners 
will send one of the losers

122
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:47,742
on Ghost Island.

123
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,967
We're going to do it schoolyard style.

124
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,837
Let's draw the captains 
and let's go!

125
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:01,994
The teams are formed.

126
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,342
In orange:

127
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,604
Domenick, Kellyn, Jenna,

128
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,471
They confront

129
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:14,442
Chelsea and Donathan.

130
00:07:14,692 --> 00:07:16,173
For the reward.

131
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:17,768
Survivors, ready?

132
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:23,261
Domenick and Wendell start.

133
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,067
Wendell... That's how it's done!

134
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,797
Come on Wendell!

135
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,368
Wendell is the first to slingshot.

136
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,467
Wendell backs up a lot.

137
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:38,791
He scores !

138
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:40,567
One for the Violets.

139
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,403
Wendell returns.

140
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:44,942
You have to cross the platform.

141
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,375
All must shoot at least once.

142
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,867
Laurel goes for the Violets.

143
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:52,558
We believe in you!

144
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,119
He hits and scores! 
It's okay, Domenick!

145
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,667
Tie, 1 1, 
with a giant reward!

146
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,939
This is Laurel.

147
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,346
Laurel shoots and scores 
for the Violets!

148
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,465
The Violets lead 2 1.

149
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:13,673
Sebastian shoots high and very far.

150
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:15,806
Not too high! A little lower !

151
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,467
This is Donathan.

152
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,783
He could 
extend the Violets' lead.

153
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:22,561
It goes too far!

154
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,149
Come back !

155
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:28,667
Sebastian fails, 
he shoots too high every time.

156
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,642
Big setback for the Oranges!

157
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,767
Donathan...

158
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,567
This sling 
is more powerful than him!

159
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,594
Back up a little harder!

160
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,867
He backs up and fires, but fails.

161
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,902
Come back ! 
Donathan gives up and leaves.

162
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,374
The Oranges 
have the opportunity to equalise.

163
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:58,023
The management was good. 
Just missed.

164
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:59,967
Angela, for the Violets.

165
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:01,775
Far too short. 
Come back !

166
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,542
The Violets have a strategy.

167
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,540
Take out their weak players 
as soon as possible

168
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:08,727
to be able to dismiss the forts.

169
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,218
We have to score here.

170
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,798
Straight to the target, it's good!

171
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:16,367
Equality, 2 2.

172
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:18,283
Chelsea for the Violets.

173
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:19,281
Come back !

174
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:22,967
Chelsea, their 
participation goal achieved, returns.

175
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,342
I'm super ready!

176
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:25,672
This is Kelly.

177
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,942
Four more targets 
for both teams.

178
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,439
The taco shack is in play!

179
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,566
She shoots. Too short.

180
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,242
Come on, come back!

181
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,077
Kelly's repartee.

182
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,098
The Oranges 
adopt the strategy of the Violets.

183
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,278
Come back, Lib!

184
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,467
Libby fires a shot and comes back.

185
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:49,342
You're going to rock, Wendell! 
Lots of strategy.

186
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:52,266
This is Wendell. 
All the Violets have passed,

187
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,269
leaving the field open 
to the best players.

188
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,942
This is Desiree. 
Come on, Des, come on!

189
00:09:58,345 --> 00:09:59,654
Nice shot.

190
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,567
She misses, 
but the direction was good.

191
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:03,942
Come on Wendell!

192
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:06,742
Desiree could 
give the advantage to the Oranges.

193
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,767
Wendell shoots for the Violets.

194
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:14,134
He scores again on the first try! 
Three for the Violets!

195
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,927
Lord, he is unleashed!

196
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,821
Wendell needs to come back 
and someone else go.

197
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:20,012
Come back, Des!

198
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:22,767
Desiree gives up and comes back.

199
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,267
Here comes Laurel again for the Violets.

200
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,600
Laurel proves to be strong 
in this ordeal.

201
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,228
And that's it for Laurel! Its good !

202
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,323
Laurel takes down a fourth target 
for the Violets.

203
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,780
Jenna's first shot.

204
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,027
Weak. In the sand. 
Go on !

205
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:44,018
Jenna is called back.

206
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,142
Wendell is back.

207
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,523
The Violets took down 
four out of six targets.

208
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,442
Oranges, only two.

209
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:54,242
Domenick must accelerate 
for the Oranges.

210
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,242
OK ?

211
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,347
Yeah, and you ? 
Good.

212
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:58,665
Come on, Dom!

213
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,008
Give tacos, Dom!

214
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:01,942
Everyone wants them!

215
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:04,542
Domenick scores, 
three for the Oranges!

216
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,643
He knocks down the fifth!

217
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,806
One more for the Violets!

218
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:13,061
Come on, Michael!

219
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:16,667
Michael tries to close the gap 
with this shot.

220
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:20,667
He must leave.

221
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,924
More than one target for the Violets, 
two for the Oranges.

222
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,159
Laurel can win for the Violets.

223
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:29,942
Domenick returns. 
Laurel begins to tire.

224
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,842
She is exhausted. 
I'm ready.

225
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,867
Laurel backs up and shoots.

226
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:37,842
Too short.

227
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,440
She is exhausted. Laurel leaves.

228
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:43,255
This is the opportunity 
the Oranges need.

229
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,167
Domenick just misses.

230
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,542
Come on, there you are!

231
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,290
Better not 
let Wendell back!

232
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:54,867
Wendell and Domenick 
are side by side again.

233
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:58,249
Everyone can smell these tacos!

234
00:11:58,374 --> 00:11:59,642
Take your time !

235
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,131
Wendell can win for the Violets.

236
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:03,597
Come on Wendell!

237
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:04,901
Come on, miss!

238
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,533
Wendell takes his time, 
for the victory!

239
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,237
And he succeeds!

240
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,167
The Violets win the reward!

241
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,542
Where to the tacos!

242
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,467
We've got it covered, friends!

243
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:20,467
How could we lose?

244
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:27,842
The Violets. 
In addition to a beautiful afternoon,

245
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,882
you decide who goes to 
Ghost Island. It's business as usual.

246
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:33,702
Either you make a unanimous choice,

247
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,642
or they pull the stones.

248
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,697
The stones, Jeff. 
The stones.

249
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,934
Palms up.

250
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:49,767
Reveal !

251
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,342
White, and this is Ghost Island.

252
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:55,542
Jenna has the white stone, 
she's going to Ghost Island.

253
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,367
Take your things, 
the boat will take you.

254
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,642
Six people go to the reward,

255
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:04,842
five return to camp, 
and Jenna goes to Ghost Island, alone.

256
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,467
You will return to camp 
tomorrow morning.

257
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,119
Angela, Donathan,

258
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:13,295
take your things, enjoy!

259
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,267
Fill your stomachs!

260
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,442
Desiree, Sebastian, Domenick, Kellyn 
, Michael,

261
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,912
nothing for you. 
Take your things, leave.

262
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:24,284
I am very excited 
about this award.

263
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:28,742
This is an opportunity to start 
building stronger bonds,

264
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,967
and perhaps to strengthen some of them.

265
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,767
Hoping 
to get the target off my back.

266
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,683
I am potentially 
at the bottom of the scale.

267
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,937
So pulling the stone, it was 
weird, I was almost happy.

268
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:10,512
I was told that we could play 
for an advantage or a disadvantage.

269
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:13,258
I'll try to approach this 
positively,

270
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:15,712
because at this stage, 
we are all playing individually.

271
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,887
I will therefore 
try to have an advantage,

272
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,584
it might help me.

273
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:25,975
Good.

274
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:29,637
Provided that there is something!

275
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:43,312
"No, not today. 
No game for you."

276
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:45,812
I broke an urn, and... 
No game for me.

277
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:47,212
It was disappointing.

278
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:49,624
When you come to the Phantom Island...

279
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:52,237
What's the point if we don't play?

280
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:55,100
People are talking, at camp, and...

281
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:57,612
Lots of things 
will happen without me.

282
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:00,069
And I'm even more pissed off

283
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,712
not to share 
the super Mexican feast.

284
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:05,596
My positive attitude 
has evaporated today.

285
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,164
God's goodness ! 
Lord !

286
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:14,612
What do we have here?

287
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:16,012
Tiki Tacos!

288
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:18,585
Our team 
couldn't seem to win.

289
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,712
All the tough guys were in front.

290
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,300
And we managed to win

291
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,912
this great reward.

292
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:27,790
Look at the margaritas! 
And beer!

293
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:28,912
At work !

294
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,524
Burritos, nachos, enchiladas...

295
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:32,812
The total!

296
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:34,632
Guacamole! 
Yeah !

297
00:15:34,757 --> 00:15:36,237
And above all, guacamole.

298
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:40,012
I'd probably 
even risk immunity for guacamole.

299
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:43,312
Congratulations to all !

300
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:47,237
We weren't the strongest, 
but we got them anyway.

301
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:50,312
Let's enjoy! 
Health !

302
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:54,412
On a personal level, 
I'm glad Laurel is here.

303
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,512
Health !

304
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:58,269
She's been my ally 
for two weeks

305
00:15:58,394 --> 00:15:59,992
and she is super strong.

306
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:02,912
But she seemed 
a little uncertain this morning.

307
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:05,805
It's good that she's here, 
to strengthen our ties.

308
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,012
And there's also Donathan, 
Laurel's right-hand man,

309
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,435
which I want to be very close,

310
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,879
because Domenick, Laurel, 
Donathan and I,

311
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:15,692
that's my top four.

312
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,768
Last night was epic.

313
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,612
I did not see anything coming.

314
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:24,915
You obviously do. 
But I do not...

315
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,812
I didn't see 
my name coming either, yet.

316
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:29,717
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

317
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:31,912
Tell me, if so!

318
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:33,612
The votes for you? 
Yes.

319
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:37,112
I do not know. Easy vote, 
I think, nothing else.

320
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,412
At first, 
you were close to Michael.

321
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:43,112
I think it comes from there.

322
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:46,350
When we have 
this label, this target,

323
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:48,112
it's hard to let go.

324
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:51,314
My name came out because of Michael.

325
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,337
They take us for a strong duo.

326
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:56,312
It sucks, cause I wanted 
him to be my ally,

327
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:59,012
but at this point i have to act

328
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:01,237
and step up my game.

329
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:24,431
I think the sun will come out, 
it will be great.

330
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:29,037
How do you feel the game? 
Good.

331
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:32,841
That Chris is gone is good.

332
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,772
It was the right first shot.

333
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:38,207
I believe that is the consensus. 
Yeah.

334
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:41,277
Chris was an easy vote.

335
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:44,712
There was no major division, 
no demarcation drawn,

336
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:47,882
which is usually the case 
at the first vote after the merger.

337
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:51,512
Chris gone, 
it's more like every man for himself.

338
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:55,612
Now 
I try to strengthen my alliances,

339
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:59,437
to make sure I prepare for 
the best possible conclusion.

340
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,377
Guys make me nervous.

341
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,512
Just the duo, Dom and Wendell.

342
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,612
Both are strong. 
Yes.

343
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:09,258
Wendell and Domenick, 
the two, as a duo,

344
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:12,263
it is very dangerous, 
because they work together.

345
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:17,306
This is why it seems important to me 
to release the most dangerous of the two.

346
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:18,612
Who first?

347
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,912
Wendell. Dom has no power.

348
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:25,512
Angela has been worried 
since Chris was eliminated.

349
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,582
So I was happy to hear

350
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:31,112
that it could strengthen our ranks 
for the next vote.

351
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:33,587
Only you were out of it, 
in the last vote.

352
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:38,737
Kellyn and Chelsea said they 
couldn't trust you.

353
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,098
In my relationship with Chris,

354
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:44,634
he only listened to his own ideas.

355
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:48,312
Now I feel free 
to play my way.

356
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:51,514
I'm definitely going to use 
what I learned in the military,

357
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:54,799
with psychological operations, 
in the civil affairs unit.

358
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:58,548
I'm going to mess things up, 
stir up emotions.

359
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,267
Michael said

360
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:04,843
that I shouldn't 
trust you, cause it's Chelsea and you

361
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,812
who didn't want to 
share the info on Chris.

362
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:11,112
When people hear 
their name being mentioned,

363
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,344
they go into "defense" mode 
and the war begins.

364
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:17,512
And that's what I want to see. 
The supreme battle.

365
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:20,512
I'm angry for the first time. 
What happened ?

366
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:24,440
And the war is over, I want 
to be triumphant, sword in hand,

367
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,712
all the victims on the ground,

368
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:31,514
and I stand proudly, 
for they are my victims.

369
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,437
We will all agree.

370
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,437
For me, it's Michael.

371
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,832
I spoke with Michael.

372
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,929
He says he wants 
to break the Dom Wendell alliance,

373
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:44,741
that you are too close 
and everyone knows it.

374
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,012
I said, "Who come out first?"

375
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:52,212
But I like it!

376
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:55,112
"Wendell will continue to win, 
he is strong."

377
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,012
Apparently 
Michael brings up my name.

378
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:02,411
He makes a mess, walks around 
and pushes people under the train.

379
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:06,949
So maybe we have 
an easy joint vote again.

380
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,537
So let's fire it!

381
00:20:24,552 --> 00:20:26,167
Over here, everyone!

382
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:41,070
Alright, let 
's get into today's immunity challenge.

383
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:43,985
First, Kellyn, 
I have to take the necklace back.

384
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:46,017
The best things have an ending.

385
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:53,194
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

386
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:57,408
Today you will be playing 
a Survivor classic.

387
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,145
It goes back to the first season.

388
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,603
This is the tasting test.

389
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,435
It is very simple 
and in several rounds.

390
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,706
The last person wins 
immunity, is immune to the vote.

391
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:15,750
The losers: on the council, 
a ninth person will be eliminated

392
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,619
and will become the second juror.

393
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,117
The finish is in sight now.

394
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:23,168
Nothing as simple as 
a psychological block

395
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:26,185
must come 
between you and victory.

396
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,547
We draw the seats 
and we go.

397
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:30,138
It's going to be good !

398
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,422
Well, on and go.

399
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:44,755
Reveal !

400
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:50,300
The most nutritious part 
of the fish.

401
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:51,385
The eye.

402
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,684
Local fishermen 
gave them to us.

403
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,596
Their families eat the flesh 
and you the eyes.

404
00:21:56,721 --> 00:22:00,161
Very simple. The first three 
who eat both eyes

405
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:02,669
and show me an empty mouth, 
qualify.

406
00:22:02,794 --> 00:22:03,931
Survivors, ready?

407
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,538
It can go fast, someone 
can swallow them all at once.

408
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,992
Open your mouth when it's good!

409
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:19,151
Michael, it's okay, step back! 
There are two places left.

410
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:23,257
Libby tries to push them down. 
Jenna is on it.

411
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:24,532
Come on, Libby!

412
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,813
Desiree, it's good! 
Laurel, it's good!

413
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:29,035
And There you go ! Libby, no, too late!

414
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,261
are qualified.

415
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:36,797
The next six! 
It's the same thing.

416
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:39,854
The first three qualify.

417
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:42,716
Let's go. Survivors, ready?

418
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,850
Wendell is way off the mark!

419
00:22:51,378 --> 00:22:53,099
Chelsea spits!

420
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:55,981
Do you see that! 
Angela, you've qualified!

421
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,395
Sebastian too.

422
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,192
C'est entre Kellyn et Domenick.

423
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:00,929
One person will qualify.

424
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:02,657
Both chew fast.

425
00:23:04,613 --> 00:23:06,882
Domenick, it's good! Qualified!

426
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:07,947
Oh, zu!

427
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:10,087
Kellyn, within seconds.

428
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:12,064
Wendell didn't even try.

429
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,823
Now that you're hot, 
let's make this more interesting.

430
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:20,344
Go ahead, reveal!

431
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:22,802
Oh my God !

432
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:25,385
Oh my God ! 
It would not be

433
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,452
a taste test without it.

434
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:30,145
beetle larva,

435
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,437
the one that Gervase couldn't swallow 
in the first season.

436
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:37,325
Will she come between you 
and your goal of reaching the end?

437
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:38,593
On and go.

438
00:23:38,843 --> 00:23:41,894
The first three 
to eat the three larvae

439
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,157
qualify.

440
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:45,160
Survivors, ready? 
Go!

441
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:48,368
Domenick shoves it.

442
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,912
Desiree chews, 
Laurel tries to tear her apart.

443
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:52,269
There you go, one more!

444
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:54,175
Angela doesn't dawdle.

445
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:55,876
Come on, Angel! Come on, Laurel!

446
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,971
Michael, it's good! 
Sebastian too!

447
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:01,349
And Angela too! 
She narrowly beats Desiree!

448
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,018
Wow ! Fast !

449
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,222
We move on to the next round.

450
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:12,776
Il ya Sebastian,

451
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:15,144
and Angela

452
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,489
Now 
we move on to the delicacies.

453
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,276
Reveal !

454
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,533
The yasawa sea slug.

455
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:26,404
The ocean is full of them.

456
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,476
You have probably come across some.

457
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:32,467
The first two to swallow both 
and show me an empty mouth

458
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,198
play the last round.

459
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:36,083
Immunity is at stake.

460
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,012
Let's go. Survivors, ready?

461
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:46,727
Angela, from the start, 
swallows a whole slug!

462
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:47,884
Wow !

463
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:50,258
Come on, one more! 
Michael works hard.

464
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:51,832
Sebastian hangs on.

465
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:53,123
This is delicious !

466
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,936
Angela is stuck, she takes it out.

467
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,939
I do n't know 
which is more disturbing.

468
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:01,259
It's good, Ang!

469
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:05,443
Angela is going to have to 
tear her to pieces.

470
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:08,082
Come on, sea bass! 
Michael is very calm.

471
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:11,719
He has slowly consumed the first 
and is on the second.

472
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:15,748
No one wants to go to council 
tonight without security.

473
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:18,125
Immunity is everything in this game.

474
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,464
Michael qualifies for the final!

475
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,243
Remain Sebastian and Angela.

476
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:23,622
Angela! 
Sea bass !

477
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:26,133
Angela succeeds! 
We have our face-to-face!

478
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,269
Michael versus Angela.

479
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,798
Congratulations to you !

480
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:33,501
Lots of protein! 
It was for-vomit-able!

481
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:40,014
Last round. The confrontation 
between Michael and Angela.

482
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:41,276
Reveal !

483
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,579
One of 
the most popular delicacies in Fiji,

484
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:47,819
mother-of-pearl conch.

485
00:25:48,217 --> 00:25:51,625
It's the flesh, 
and there's a lot of it.

486
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:53,901
The issues are clear.

487
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:55,854
Let's go. For immunity.

488
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:57,713
Survivors, ready?

489
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:02,042
Come on, Angel!

490
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,102
Both have the same strategy.

491
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,773
They start to bake

492
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:09,205
the flesh of the mother-of-pearl conch.

493
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,029
Angela is unleashed!

494
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:13,801
If she manages to swallow!

495
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,011
Endorse! 
You go-y !

496
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:18,881
Angela continues to bake.

497
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,799
Michael tries to follow.

498
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:24,323
He will have to speed up 
because Angela does not dawdle!

499
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:28,206
Angela still has a handful.

500
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:29,222
The last !

501
00:26:29,347 --> 00:26:31,653
But she is 
a bit ahead of Michael.

502
00:26:31,926 --> 00:26:34,978
Michael can't afford 
to take too long.

503
00:26:35,282 --> 00:26:38,811
You want immunity? Accelerate! 
Because Angela is launched.

504
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:40,428
Mode brutasse, you go-y!

505
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:42,372
Last track for Angela!

506
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,025
A ton of flesh!

507
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:48,069
Michael swallows another bite.

508
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:49,718
He only has one left.

509
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:52,289
Useless corn! Angela for purposes!

510
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:55,493
Angela wins 
individual immunity!

511
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,990
Away from the council!

512
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,669
Attractive ! 
Oh my God !

513
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:07,430
Oh my God ! Brutal fashion!

514
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:09,196
Don't kiss me!

515
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,938
Lord !

516
00:27:11,374 --> 00:27:13,713
I'll finish it, I want... 
Really?

517
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:16,015
I want to have eaten it all. 
Go for it !

518
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,890
Michael, explain to me.

519
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:25,695
The ordeal is over 
and you wanted to finish.

520
00:27:25,836 --> 00:27:28,472
I will never eat 
stuff like this again

521
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:30,967
and 
probably won't play Survivor again.

522
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:32,826
You have to do it when you can.

523
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,963
You were close, but not close enough. 
Angela, come here!

524
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,434
Angela, immunity is yours.

525
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,738
You're safe 
at tonight's council.

526
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:44,940
Others,

527
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:48,320
after 25 hard days 
in Survivor,

528
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:50,928
someone will be 
the ninth person eliminated

529
00:27:51,053 --> 00:27:53,501
and the second juror. 
It won't be you.

530
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:56,252
Take your things, leave. 
See you tonight. Congratulation !

531
00:27:57,196 --> 00:28:00,413
It's always disappointing 
to lose immunity.

532
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:02,195
But I trust the plan

533
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,624
that I put in place 
these last days

534
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,179
to eliminate Wendell.

535
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:08,914
Wendell and Domenick 
is the two-headed serpent.

536
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,241
So... we need to get Wendell out.

537
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:25,287
Angie, 
the sea slug terror!

538
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,486
Gaining immunity is very nice.

539
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:30,726
But beating Michael 
was clearly among my priorities.

540
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,497
Now voting seems easy,

541
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:36,877
because I had a plan to 
mess things up, and it worked.

542
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:40,327
So I think I have 
a bit of power right now.

543
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,875
It's clearly new, 
challenging and fun.

544
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,358
What's going on ? 
I do not know.

545
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:53,899
I think... 
everyone agrees.

546
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,282
Michael. 
Yes.

547
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:58,685
I haven't heard anything yet. 
What's going on ?

548
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,049
I believe that...

549
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:03,638
... the consensus 
is to eliminate Michael tonight.

550
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:05,636
Of course, it is decided as a group.

551
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:08,128
I'm not in a position 
to influence that.

552
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:11,212
I don't want 
you to have that impression.

553
00:29:11,337 --> 00:29:13,691
Think about it. 
In fact, you are the one...

554
00:29:13,816 --> 00:29:16,814
We depend more on you 
than you on us.

555
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:20,422
If Michael has the idol... 
We should split the votes.

556
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:23,437
Yeah, have a backup plan, just 
in case, like...

557
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:26,453
...five for Michael, 
and then four for Libby.

558
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:28,745
Even if it's fusion,

559
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,992
it's still original Naviti and original 
Malolo.

560
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:34,605
But if we can 
rally Laurel and Donathan,

561
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,280
we can divide the votes,

562
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:38,928
in case Michael or Libby 
have an idol.

563
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:40,610
Five votes on Michael,

564
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,257
four on Libby.

565
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:44,112
If we all follow the plan.

566
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:50,626
Hello. 
Hello.

567
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:51,689
How are you ?

568
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,524
So who for tonight?

569
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:59,444
I am between two waters, 
to be frank.

570
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,430
If the Naviti split the votes

571
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:03,711
and that the Malolos vote together,

572
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,640
we can take out whoever we want.

573
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:10,588
I think the Naviti are welded,

574
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,529
but if they split the votes,

575
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:15,360
the five of us 
can take anyone out.

576
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:18,780
We were demolished, shot down. 
It's our turn to be strong.

577
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,449
And... If I decide 
to play my idol tonight,

578
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:25,050
I know I'm quiet 
for one more vote, but...

579
00:30:25,175 --> 00:30:27,894
I would prefer 
not to have to.

580
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,596
Who do you prefer? 
Wendell.

581
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:37,232
My main allies 
are Donathan, Domenick and Wendell.

582
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:40,414
But getting Wendell out 
would be a big deal.

583
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,754
No doubt enough to fill a CV.

584
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:46,608
It's about whether I want 
to continue working with him.

585
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:50,166
But if he smells something, 
he could play his idol.

586
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:52,631
It will determine the course of the game

587
00:30:52,756 --> 00:30:54,480
and my future in the game.

588
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,503
It's a very big decision.

589
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,700
I'm trying to decide if we should 
be dangerous tonight.

590
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:05,627
The Malolos, we stay together. 
Yeah.

591
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,408
The closer it gets, 
the more my instinct tells me

592
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,733
to stay with Malolo 
one more vote.

593
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:14,735
Our chances would be better 
with more equal forces.

594
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:15,950
OK.

595
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:18,073
The longer I wait

596
00:31:18,198 --> 00:31:21,769
the more I fear 
that a Malolo will come out tonight.

597
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:24,062
I had this feeling 
today

598
00:31:24,187 --> 00:31:25,868
that i will never win

599
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:27,908
if there are too many Naviti.

600
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,221
But if I turn against them

601
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,229
and it turns out badly for us,

602
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:35,021
on the next tip, 
it will probably be me.

603
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:37,051
For you, is this the best thing to do?

604
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:40,561
The one I always 
trusted was Laurel.

605
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:42,575
But if I succeed

606
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,362
that would be great for my game.

607
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,170
Apparently it's Michael.

608
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,334
Voting with the majority.

609
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:52,915
It shows that you are.

610
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,399
It's smarter.

611
00:31:54,524 --> 00:31:57,461
I spoke with Dom. 
They vote Michael.

612
00:31:57,586 --> 00:31:58,917
I have my back to the wall.

613
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,237
So I should 
vote against my former ally

614
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,759
to save me.

615
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:05,809
Thanks. 
You are quiet tonight.

616
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:08,756
It sucks. I hate doing this.

617
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:14,229
We are five. They are more numerous 
and divide the votes.

618
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:17,022
Between whom and whom? 
Mike and you.

619
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:19,806
Dom tells me that I risk nothing.

620
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:23,104
Then Don tells me that they are dividing 
the votes between Michael and me.

621
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:24,539
Wait... what?!

622
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,090
Let's stick together one more vote. 
Yes.

623
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:29,768
To equalize the forces. 
Yes.

624
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,151
We want to solder the Malolos.

625
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:34,388
If we vote together, without betraying,

626
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:37,919
it can be 
a whole new start for me.

627
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:40,734
But I don't know who to believe anymore.

628
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,208
Who to trust, 
who to be wary of?

629
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:47,128
Will the Malolos remain united? 
I am torn.

630
00:32:49,524 --> 00:32:50,865
I feel it well.

631
00:32:51,032 --> 00:32:54,295
The only ones I can't decipher 
are Laurel and Donathan.

632
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:57,053
Yeah. We will be fixed this evening.

633
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:01,159
The council is approaching. 
I have Erik's idol,

634
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:03,979
and he made 
the dumbest decision

635
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:06,926
in Survivor Micronesia, 
Fans vs. Favorites.

636
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,535
I don't want to 
prolong Erik's curse.

637
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,838
But now, in the game of Survivor,

638
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:14,227
I have to be 
willing to take risks.

639
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:17,191
So I'm trying 
to avoid having to play it tonight.

640
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:20,234
We cannot necessarily believe everything 
on this island.

641
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:24,059
The board is the place to listen 
and hear the clues.

642
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:26,597
There is clearly a danger.

643
00:33:26,722 --> 00:33:29,416
But with any luck, 
I'll spend the night.

644
00:33:54,318 --> 00:33:56,346
Here is now the first juror.

645
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:02,417
Chris, eliminated at the last council.

646
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,350
Angela. 
Let's start with today's test.

647
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:14,859
You looked 
physically different today.

648
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:18,008
And your actions have confirmed it. 
What happened ?

649
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:20,501
I was tired 
of being at the bottom of the ladder,

650
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,709
to always be 
excluded from discussions,

651
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:25,126
to learn everything at the last moment.

652
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:28,270
I knew I had to win, 
take matters into my own hands.

653
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:31,725
Sebastian. 
Angela took a sea slug

654
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,081
and swallowed it.

655
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:35,416
It was quite impressive.

656
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,378
I work 
in seafood.

657
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:42,387
I was impressed to see 
a woman do this better than me.

658
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:46,835
Donathan. 
When you see such an effort,

659
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,089
do you feel the game 
getting stronger?

660
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:50,800
Yes. The last days,

661
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:53,734
people do their own thing,

662
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,489
alliances are formed.

663
00:34:55,614 --> 00:34:57,805
And it's no longer Malolo and Naviti.

664
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,969
It's Lavita, 
it's a brand new game.

665
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:01,746
Desiree. Do you agree ?

666
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:04,331
Or do you still feel 
that tugging?

667
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:07,275
"Naviti, Malolo... 
Should I get rid of it?"

668
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,730
Are we at the stage 
where we are considering big moves?

669
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:14,574
Who does not plan big shots 
at this stage, does not really play.

670
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:18,459
And if it's staying with Naviti, 
then it's staying with Naviti.

671
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:21,166
If it's joining Malolo, 
it's joining Malolo.

672
00:35:21,311 --> 00:35:24,738
In the end, 
it all depends on your analysis.

673
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:28,702
Domenick. Will 
the new final board format

674
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,727
favors those who strike

675
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:32,435
rather than followers,

676
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,760
because now, 
we can boast of his game?

677
00:35:35,893 --> 00:35:38,293
Absolutely. The new format

678
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:42,068
allows people to come here 
and betray their best friends,

679
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:44,657
while being able to explain

680
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:46,987
at the end, 
why it was necessary.

681
00:35:47,335 --> 00:35:50,622
Wendell. Is the risk 
that the smart follower

682
00:35:50,747 --> 00:35:53,261
says to himself: 
"Let the lions devour each other,

683
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:56,193
I will be the vulture that will come 
and pick up the pieces."?

684
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:57,741
It's a huge risk.

685
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,567
The strongest is in the jury, there.

686
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:04,505
And once an alpha male is gone, 
another seems to emerge,

687
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:06,858
but he becomes the new target.

688
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:08,694
So yes, very big risk.

689
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:12,422
Michael. How many moves in advance 
do you envisage, for the moment?

690
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:15,841
Because that shouldn't 
make you lose sight of this piece of advice either.

691
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,066
For me, only this advice counts.

692
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:21,580
I tell myself that some 
may feel too sure of themselves

693
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:24,163
and do not consider 
early blows

694
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:26,176
maybe they should do.

695
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:27,928
Laurel. Very interesting.

696
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:30,167
"Some people may be 
too sure of themselves."

697
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:32,759
Yes. The Naviti 
still have the power.

698
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:35,200
No matter what they say, 
this division lives on.

699
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:38,010
That's what we, Malolo, 
are trying to tell them.

700
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:39,862
They are not all at the top.

701
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:42,490
We're just trying 
to get one of them to act,

702
00:36:42,615 --> 00:36:44,300
to use us while we're here.

703
00:36:44,425 --> 00:36:46,593
Chelsea. Laurel says, basically,

704
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,940
that if you are 
in a real majority,

705
00:36:49,065 --> 00:36:51,020
are you sure you're 
not the bottom?

706
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,812
Frankly, 
if you're last in the group,

707
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:55,976
you are stupid to stay there,

708
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:58,559
because, congratulations, 
you are in the jury!

709
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:01,936
Wendell. It is therefore necessary to convince 
the others that they are in a better position!

710
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:03,063
Basically, yes.

711
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:06,584
You preach what you want 
others to believe.

712
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:09,564
“We dominate. You are calm.

713
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:10,904
Go to sleep."

714
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,763
It's very "cult", Jeff, 
really!

715
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:17,696
And yet, Domenick, 
everyone knows the lie.

716
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,648
Yes. It's no joke here.

717
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:22,102
Have all the conversations 
you want,

718
00:37:22,227 --> 00:37:24,293
you know you're being bullshit,

719
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:26,933
and, especially at this stage of the game,

720
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:30,719
we don't know if someone 
will change sides, or when.

721
00:37:30,844 --> 00:37:34,962
Kellyn. What would be the point, 
for someone, of changing sides?

722
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:38,332
It would be a huge change

723
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:41,721
which would undoubtedly require 
a masterful force of conviction,

724
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:44,638
because going from Violets to Oranges

725
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,709
wouldn't make much sense, 
you'd stay at the very bottom.

726
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:50,680
It's time 
to draw the lines

727
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:54,726
and one should know more 
from this advice than from any other.

728
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:57,183
What's your criteria 
tonight, Michael?

729
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,836
What move are you playing?

730
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:02,784
You have to do the right thing 
when you have a majority for that.

731
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:06,245
For some, maybe it 
's time to get out,

732
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,964
because they have the majority.

733
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:09,891
But it goes both ways.

734
00:38:10,016 --> 00:38:12,701
Sit too long 
on a bomb

735
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:15,208
and it can 
explode in your face.

736
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,621
Everyone really needs to think

737
00:38:17,746 --> 00:38:19,787
to blows at his disposal

738
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:23,132
and at the right time 
to seize the opportunity.

739
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:29,883
Well, it's time to vote. 
Desiree, over to you.

740
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:13,962
I will count the votes.

741
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,910
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

742
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:27,808
now is the time to do it.

743
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:44,258
I may be a bit paranoid

744
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:48,227
but I would hate to leave 
with that in my pocket.

745
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:56,370
So it was 
Ozzy's fake stick idol.

746
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:59,385
in Survivor Micronesia, 2007.

747
00:39:59,846 --> 00:40:01,308
I dedicate it to Ozzy.

748
00:40:06,225 --> 00:40:07,816
This is not...

749
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:10,150
...no longer just a stick.

750
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:12,892
He's a real idol.

751
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,689
Votes against Michael 
will not count.

752
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:20,928
I will read the votes.

753
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:25,939
Michael. Does not count.

754
00:40:28,985 --> 00:40:30,537
Michael. Does not count.

755
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,170
Michael. Does not count.

756
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:37,632
Michael. Does not count.

757
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:41,760
Michael. Does not count.

758
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:45,252
Michael. Does not count.

759
00:40:47,182 --> 00:40:49,100
Michael. Does not count.

760
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:06,944
Libby. Two Libby votes, 
one Wendell vote.

761
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,445
Ninth person eliminated 
and second member of the jury:

762
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,649
Libby. Three is enough. 
Bring me your torch.

763
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:19,764
Good luck to everyone. 
Hi Libby.

764
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:21,856
It will be fine. Good luck.

765
00:41:24,244 --> 00:41:25,658
Well done, sir.

766
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:32,162
Libby, the tribe has spoken.

767
00:41:33,915 --> 00:41:35,509
Goodbye ! 
Hi !

768
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:46,539
Survivor is often compared 
to a roller coaster.

769
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:49,778
After 25 days, two members of the jury

770
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:53,234
and Ghost Island still in play, 
it's far from over.

771
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,822
Take your torches, 
return to the camp. Good night.

772
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:09,426
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

773
00:42:12,817 --> 00:42:15,106
Next time in Survivor...

774
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:17,064
There is hope for Malolo.

775
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:19,074
I'm ready to take out the Naviti.

776
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:20,697
Properly armed...

777
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:23,441
Des tries to rally the Malolo 
against you.

778
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:25,097
I have to make them paranoid.

779
00:42:25,222 --> 00:42:27,043
...they could 
blow up the game.

780
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:29,647
Everyone freaks out. 
Who is telling the truth?

781
00:42:29,772 --> 00:42:31,421
A Malolo is going to leave.

782
00:42:31,546 --> 00:42:32,687
It's going to screw up.

783
00:42:32,812 --> 00:42:36,159
For three councils, 
my name came out for no reason.

784
00:42:36,284 --> 00:42:40,697
And that sucks, because you 
really trust people.

785
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:43,963
I did my best, 
I won trials,

786
00:42:44,088 --> 00:42:46,234
food rewards,

787
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:47,884
I made alliances.

788
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:49,443
I am proud of myself

789
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,608
and grateful 
to have had this experience.
