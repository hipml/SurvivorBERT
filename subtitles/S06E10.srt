00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,048
JEFF PROBST:<i> Tonight, join us</i>
<i>for a special episode</i>

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,760
<i>of</i> Survivor: The Amazon,
<i>as we take a look back</i>

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,762
<i>at the first 27 days,</i>
<i>through highlights</i>

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:18,268
<i>and never-before-seen footage.</i>

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,687
We're going to split it up
like-like a calendar,

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,731
and day one, two, three, and
we're going to make a crate...

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,065
'Cause Rob and I were
the great counters,

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,233
you know, for both tribes.

9
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,611
ROB:
<i>I had been painting with Heidi.</i>

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,405
<i>This is the hottest girl</i>
<i>I've ever talked to.</i>

11
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>She has both natural</i>

12
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,119
and man-made beauty qualities.

13
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,620
You know,
you guys want in the cage.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,705
-Kind of going...
-ROGER:<i> Christy, uh--</i>

15
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,998
<i>we have made her feel good</i>
<i>about herself.</i>

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,584
CHRISTY:<i> They thought,</i>
<i>"Yeah, that would be cool."</i>

17
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,127
<i>Be lots of signs, you know.</i>

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,336
<i>They were, like,</i>
<i>"We'll learn some signs."</i>

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,631
Tambaqui is a fish,
so this is fish.

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,927
That is so great that people
really want to, like, learn.

21
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,429
JEANNE:
There's been a lot more,

22
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,515
um, noises
in the jungle tonight,

23
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,351
and I just saw something
over there.

24
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,020
HEIDI:<i> I mean,</i>
<i>it's definitely an animal.</i>

25
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,689
<i>It's so close to our camp.</i>

26
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,524
So I'm a little freaked out
right now.

27
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,014
PROBST:<i> 27 days ago,</i>
<i>16 Americans were stranded</i>

28
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,351
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the Amazonian rain forest.</i>

29
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,896
<i>Immediately, the castaways were</i>
<i>separated into two tribes.</i>

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,356
As I call out your your name,

31
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,732
I want you
to climb down the rope ladder.

32
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,902
Jeanne. Heidi. Joanna.

33
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,904
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>the survivors</i>

34
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,532
<i>were divided</i>
<i>along gender lines.</i>

35
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,826
It is only fitting that, for the
first time, while we're here

36
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,788
<i>in the Amazon, we have a tribe</i>
<i>of women versus a tribe of men.</i>

37
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,622
(whooping and laughter)

38
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,916
DEENA:
<i>I was absolutely just</i>

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,918
<i>overjoyed that</i>
<i>it was an all-female tribe.</i>

40
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,753
<i>It's an all-chick thing.</i>

41
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,255
We can let our hair down.

42
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,965
We can pee
in front of each other.

43
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,091
-Dave.
-Dave?

44
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,634
DANIEL:<i> All the guys</i>
<i>were really pumped up.</i>

45
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,887
<i>There is no way that women</i>

46
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>are going to beat us</i>
<i>in anything--</i>

47
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,431
physical, mentally.

48
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,850
<i>We're never going</i>
<i>to go to Tribal Council.</i>

49
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,894
Tribal Council-- we ain't
goin' to Tribal Council.

50
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,937
JENNA:
<i>They're so freaking cocky.</i>

51
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,274
I just want to beat them to just
kind of like shut them up.

52
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,483
PROBST:<i> But the women</i>
<i>stumbled from the start.</i>

53
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,610
Ryan?

54
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,070
(indistinct chatter)

55
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,202
SHAWNA:<i> I just couldn't even</i>
<i>untie a boat,</i>

56
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,079
<i>and I just felt so stupid.</i>

57
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,414
The guys going off one way.

58
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,582
The girls couldn't untie...

59
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,750
Well, I couldn't untie the knot.

60
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,794
PROBST:<i> When the men arrived</i>
<i>at their camp,</i>

61
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,254
<i>they brimmed with confidence.</i>

62
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,298
-(whooping)
-Yeah!

63
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,133
You know, we're all... we're
all friggin' men of pride,

64
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,301
men of honor, whatnot...

65
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,928
(laughter)

66
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,471
-And right now, baby...
-Tell it.

67
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,056
Yeah, we're the favorites
right now.

68
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,558
PROBST:
<i>The Tambaqui men</i>

69
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,770
<i>aggressively began</i>
<i>to build their new camp.</i>

70
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,816
I think I missed my calling
in life as a lumberjack.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,488
PROBST:<i> At Jaburu,</i>
<i>Christy revealed her secret.</i>

72
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,157
I... It's not a big deal,
but I think it's something

73
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,827
that every tribe member
should know, that I am deaf.

74
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,288
I can't hear. I read lips.
Um, night time...

75
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,165
JANET:<i> Christy has</i>
<i>a hearing disability.</i>

76
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>She just asked us</i>
<i>to look at her</i>

77
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,962
and speak slowly,
so she could read our lips.

78
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,213
<i>It took us by surprise.</i>

79
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,714
Oh, my God.

80
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,341
PROBST:<i> Unlike the men,</i>
<i>the women struggled</i>

81
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,717
<i>to get their camp</i>
<i>up and running.</i>

82
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,719
(grunts)

83
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,888
We almost got it.

84
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,145
PROBST:<i> And unable</i>
<i>to read lips in the dark,</i>

85
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,188
<i>Christy felt like an outsider.</i>

86
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,856
Did you notice

87
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,025
the guys stared at Heidi
when they got on the boat?

88
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,569
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

89
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,030
I'm missing out on a lot
of the information.

90
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,409
<i>I could never be like them,</i>
<i>because I'm not.</i>

91
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,828
<i>I'm always totally different;</i>
<i>always have been.</i>

92
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,205
(voice breaking): Just, like,
I'm at a big disadvantage.

93
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,415
I'm at a big disadvantage.

94
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,583
(sniffles)

95
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,712

Okay?

97

Ryan, you want to stoke
that fire up

98
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:01,718
and check that water,

99
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,094
ROB:<i> Roger definitely</i>

<i>Go-Go do this, go do that.</i>

101
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,889
I just go-go and do it, but

102
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,307
<i>I'll put it all</i>
<i>in a mental note.</i>

103
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:12,020
PROBST:<i> Ryan and Daniel failed</i>
<i>to impress their tribe mates.</i>

104

ROGER:<i> This kid Ryan</i>
<i>and the kid Daniel--</i>

105
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,525
uh, they're just
not contributing.

106
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,193
<i>They're just useless.</i>

107
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,529
PROBST:<i> Despite their</i>
<i>differences, the men seemed</i>

108

<i>to have it together.</i>

109

ALL:
Tambaqui!

110
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,949
-Oh!
-Oh!

111
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,035
We're like
the Eight Musketeers.

112
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,079
PROBST:<i> But at Jaburu, the</i>

<i>We're having a difficult time</i>

169
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,710
There's some over here,
but they're hard to get into.

170
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,254
<i>The natural resources</i>
<i>in the Amazon are fish.</i>

171
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,382
<i>There's some plants that</i>
<i>we can eat, plenty of nuts,</i>

172
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,760
<i>and lots of fruit, but we</i>
<i>haven't explored enough, so...</i>

173
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,890
I just spend whatever time
I have available to go hunt.

174
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,224
-Oh, my...
-Oh, my God!

175
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,392
What? Did you find it?

176
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,729
-It's a pineapple!
-(both screaming)

177
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,064
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God! Pineapple!

178
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,232
(screaming)

179
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,775
(Joanna mumbles)

180
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,235
Are they under the ground?

181
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,778
Here's a pineapple.

182
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,156
-Oh, my...
-Thank you, Lord.

183
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,450
(yelling)

184
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,911
It's not ripe, but...

185
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,579
♪ Hallelujah! ♪

186
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,082
♪ Hallelujah! ♪

187
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,210
-So, I can't believe...
-Look at this.

188
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,754
JOANNA:<i> Jeanne and I came back</i>
<i>to camp with the pineapple,</i>

189
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,215
<i>and I had the pineapple</i>
<i>concealed in my jacket.</i>

190
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,633
And we wanted everyone
to be there

191
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,926
when we pulled out
this pineapple.

192
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,260
(singing a fanfare)

193
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,762
-Drum roll, please.
-Oh, no.

194
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,932
(all screaming and cheering)

195
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,099
That was a pineapple bush.

196
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,559
(cheering)

197
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,810
All right!

198
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,770
JOANNA:
This is the Amazon.

199
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,396
This may be the size
of the pineapples here.

200
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,731
It's yellowing.

201
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,982
(indistinct chatter)

202
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,400
Wait a minute, girl. No.

203
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,610
This is good, thank you.

204
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,278
-Yeah!
-Look at that, and...

205
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,739
-It's not green.
-It's not?

206
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,574
It is sweet. Mm-hmm.

207
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,828
-Oh, my God.
-(shrieking)

208
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,289
JENNA:
<i>I don't know if it's because</i>

209
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,583
<i>we're starving, and probably</i>
<i>anything tastes good.</i>

210
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,252
<i>But it was so good,</i>

211
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,295
and, uh, I think it kind of like
lifted everybody else's

212
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,380
<i>spirits a little bit,</i>

213
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,257
<i>because we were just,</i>
<i>like, delirious.</i>

214
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,926
Okay, I need about ten more,
and I'll be really good to go.

215
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,844
(laughter)

216
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,519
PROBST:<i> But the good spirits</i>
<i>didn't last long</i>

217
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,646
<i>when controversy</i>
<i>arose in the camp.</i>

218
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,814
Yeah.

219
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,315
What is that?

220
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,192
There's something in there
that shouldn't be in there.

221
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,152
JENNA:<i> We put all of our stuff</i>
<i>in the box.</i>

222
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,988
At the bottom,
there's a granola bar.

223
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,698
Somebody just needs to fess up.

224
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,825
DEENA:<i> Everybody is</i>
<i>adamantly denying it.</i>

225
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,119
And of course, I want to know
who took the candy bar.

226
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:42,498
Jeanne saw the little candy bar
thing inside of Janet's bag.

227
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,874
PROBST:
<i>With all eyes looking at her,</i>

228
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,627
<i>Janet denied any involvement.</i>

229
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,298
I don't know who smuggled it in,
but it wasn't me.

230
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,300
So if you're going to
vote me off,

231
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,218
that's fine, as long as
it's not for that reason,

232
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,761
because if it is,
you're making a mistake.

233
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,557
PROBST:
<i>For immunity, the men and women</i>

234
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,518
<i>faced off in their first</i>
<i>mental challenge.</i>

235
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,563
How many rungs are on
the outside ladder?

236
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,149
Deena says eight, Rob says six.

237
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,318
Correct answer: six.

238
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,862
<i>And the men celebrated</i>
<i>their first victory...</i>

239
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,863
(cheering)

240
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,868
<i>...sending the women</i>
<i>to their first Tribal Council,</i>

241
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,579
<i>where Janet was the second</i>
<i>person voted out of the Amazon.</i>

242
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,706
Janet.
That's four and that's enough.

243
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,915
Need to bring me your torch.

244
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,667
JANET:
<i>We'd gone, you know,</i>

245
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,044
<i>six days without food.</i>

246
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,004
We were having trouble
getting water boiled,

247
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,255
so we were barely drinking.

248
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,383
<i>And then hard, hard</i>
<i>physical labor all day long.</i>

249
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,219
Janet, the tribe has spoken.

250
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,806
JANET:<i> Here, these 23-year-olds</i>
<i>were dropping like flies,</i>

251
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,060
<i>so I had to wonder, at 46,</i>
<i>realistically here,</i>

252
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:48,230
<i>how much longer</i>
<i>could I really take out there?</i>

253
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,776
So, I think this is a midlife
crisis gone extremely wrong.

254
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,777
(laughs)

255
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,580
PROBST:<i> That night, after</i>
<i>Tribal Council, the women had</i>

256
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,416
<i>trouble sleeping,</i>
<i>as the Amazon came alive.</i>

257
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,876
JEANNE:
<i>There's been a lot more,</i>

258
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,253
<i>um, noises</i>
<i>in the jungle tonight.</i>

259
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,090
And I just saw something
over there.

260
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,425
<i>I did hear something</i>
<i>over where our food is.</i>

261
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,552
<i>Heidi heard the same thing.</i>

262
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,595
<i>She got up.</i>

263
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,097
<i>She had to go to the bathroom.</i>

264
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,264
The lantern's on the box.

265
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,267
HEIDI:<i> I've never heard</i>
<i>any noises this close</i>

266
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,561
<i>to our camp before,</i>
<i>and that just creeps me out.</i>

267
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,480
I really think that
they're just getting used to us.

268
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,648
I mean,
it's definitely an animal.

269
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,608
It's so close to our camp.

270
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,443
I'll go with you.
I'll bring my machete.

271
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,945
What is it going to do?

272
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,446
Okay.

273
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,951
(makes whooshing sounds)

274
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,876
Something's breathing
over there.

275
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,711
What's that?

276
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,631
HEIDI:<i> Literally, bats are</i>
<i>swooping down at our head.</i>

277
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,300
(grunting)

278
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,970
So I'm a little
freaked out right now.

279
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,430
(anxious laugh)

280
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,432
And I've really got to go
to the bathroom.

281
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,517
-You afraid?
-Yeah.

282
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,770
<i>So we run over, trying to</i>
<i>get away from the bats...</i>

283
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,772
I just-- I see something
glowing out there.

284
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,815
<i>...and here are these sets</i>

285
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,609
<i>of glowing eyes</i>
<i>just staring at us.</i>

286
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,194
-You see it?
-Yep.

287
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,490
Do you want to go down there
to go to the bathroom?

288
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,284
You can hold it?

289
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,660
Yes.

290
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,662
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little freaked.

291
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,497
-Come on, let's walk down here.
-No.

292
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,000
Come down here
and I'll dig a hole.

293
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,084
No.

294
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,794
HEIDI:<i> There is</i>

00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,006

Oh, Daniel...

299
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,019
can you get us some water?

300
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,062
Sure.

301
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,105
I don't, I don't...

302

If you, if you--

303
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,444
I'll go do it.

304
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,032
ROGER:
<i>It really got me hot.</i>

305
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,117
I-- tempted to slap the kid
around, to be honest with you.

306
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,704
DANIEL:<i> Roger-- he just</i>
<i>barks orders all the time.</i>

307

I mean, he's not
very friendly about it.

308
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,749
He just tells people what to do.

309
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,084
<i>Uh, I'm not really</i>

<i>Jaburu was coming together.</i>

312
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:23,552
So I think we should, uh,
maybe initiate a leader.

313
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,221
I, um, initiate Deena.

314
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,057
Do you accept the offer?

315
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,350
You know, I'm gonna--

316
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,352
All I want to do
is we delegate the tasks

317
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,229
that are important for the day.

318
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,855
DEENA:<i> I didn't take that</i>
<i>with open arms</i>

319
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,857
because that puts
a big target on your body.

320
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,943
And who wants to get
voted out of the game?

321
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,779
<i>But, yes, I am going to do it.</i>

322
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,448
PROBST:<i> Deena's leadership</i>

327
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,395

00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,748
Immunity, Jaburu!

338
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,834
(cheering)

339
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,633
<i>...sending Tambaqui</i>

340
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,261
<i>where Daniel was</i>
<i>the third person voted out.</i>

341
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,596
Dan. That's four votes,
that's enough.

342
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,014
Need to bring me your torch.

343
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,641
DANIEL:<i> I've never gone camping</i>

344
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,977
<i>I'm a city slicker,</i>
<i>and I hated camping.</i>

345
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,105
I would never, ever go
on a camping trip voluntarily.

346
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,481
<i>It was really for pure ego.</i>

347
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,484
<i>You know, I wanted to be the</i>

348
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,904
I'm sitting here, so that goal
didn't get accomplished.

349
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,283
It's time for you to go.

350
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,619
DANIEL:
<i>Bruce Lee once said,</i>

351

<i>"Low aim, not failure,</i>

00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,832
You know, it's sometimes
even glorious to fail.

353
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,673
PROBST:<i> On day ten,</i>
<i>the younger women of Jaburu</i>

354
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,509
<i>sought to solidify</i>
<i>their positions.</i>

355
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,677
SHAWNA:
<i>The older women might try</i>

356
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,347
<i>to weed out the meek or prissy.</i>

357
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,681
<i>So I figured,</i>

358
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,475
with my closeness to Deena,

359
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,185
that if we could
swing Deena's vote,

360
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,728
then it was, you know, game on.

361
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,021
I just need to know.

362
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:39,855
Yes.

DEENA:
<i>The other girls and I</i>

<i>talked very briefly,</i>

365
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,360

<i>that that would be</i>

Three fish for dinner.

369
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,951
Small but edible.

370
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,744
Cool.

00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,371
PROBST:
<i>Over at Tambaqui,</i>

372
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,831
<i>Rob was worried</i>
<i>about his position.</i>

373
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,750
ROB:
<i>I would say that maybe Matt</i>

374
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,002
<i>is the hardest worker</i>
<i>in the tribe.</i>

375
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>I work very hard,</i>
<i>but I'm not nearly as strong</i>

376
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,049
<i>as anybody else in the tribe.</i>

377
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,009
I try to do as much,
as much as I can,

378
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,928
but there's only so much
that-that I can do.

379
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,306
All right, Alex,
watch it, watch it.

380
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,683
I'm going to bring this in here.

381
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,020
<i>One thing that I try to do</i>
<i>consistently through this game</i>

382
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,146
<i>is never be lazy,</i>

383
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,233
<i>be, uh, well-liked</i>
<i>within the tribe, and</i>

384
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,068
scheme and plot my fanny off.

385
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,904
Those look pretty-pretty,
uh, tasty there, Rob.

386
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:29,905
Yeah.

387
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,658
<i>I'm a little nervous right now</i>

388
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,203

<i>making me the next person</i>
<i>to be voted out.</i>

390
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,960
What makes me think that I'm the
next one to go is just the way

391
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,920
<i>that Alex, Roger,</i>
<i>Butch and Dave</i>

392
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:49,091

<i>useful Matt is at catching fish</i>

393
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,342
<i>and doing things</i>
<i>around the camp.</i>

394
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,386
<i>I think that maybe they're</i>
<i>going to weigh it out</i>

395
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,595
<i>and decide that</i>
<i>the guy that does</i>

396

the wisecracks isn't as useful

397
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,223
as the guy
that catches the fish.

398
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,565
PROBST:<i> At the reward challenge,</i>
<i>the men were fired up.</i>

399
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,774
Nobody touch it.

400
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,775
Cheer it on, fellas.

401
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,776
Yeah!

402
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,111

Oh, yeah, boys.

409
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,081
Tambaqui!

410
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,084
<i>...Jaburu returned</i>
<i>to camp empty-handed.</i>

411
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,921
<i>And Shawna was ready</i>
<i>to call it quits.</i>

412
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,467
After we lost that Coke, it took
everything in my entire brain

413
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,428
to not make my body just want
to just sit on the sand

414
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,264
and be, like, I have to take
a three-hour break.

415
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,850
I don't see myself
lasting for 30 more days.

416
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,310
Are you at this point
right this very moment

417
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,437
where you say, "I want out"?

418
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,772
If we were going tonight,

419
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,483
I would be very tempted
to get out.

420
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,942
Yeah, I don't know
that I could do it.

421
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,325
PROBST:<i> Shawna sat out the next</i>

Tambaqui, congratulations.

00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,710
Yeah!

427
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,006
<i>Even though Shawna was weak,</i>

<i>the alliance of</i>
<i>Deena, Heidi and Jenna</i>

DEENA:<i> I feel a tremendous</i>

But at the same time,
you have an agreement.

432
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,518
And I don't want to get screwed
to help her out.

433
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,852
Joanna is clearly

434
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,855
<i>the most physical person</i>
<i>that we have on this team.</i>

435

436
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,567
Shawna, guess what?

437
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,902
You're not in charge here.

438
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,654
<i>It's about the core alliance.</i>

439
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,614
<i>Suck it up, baby, 'cause</i>

<i>I knew that</i>

Deena would come after me

446

because I was-- my presence
was very strong there.

447
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,258
Joanna, the tribe has spoken.

448
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,845
<i>The water's nasty,</i>
<i>I'm struggling,</i>

449

<i>I don't have any help out here,</i>

450
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,057
nobody's fishing, everybody's
laying down looking crazy,

451
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,684
it's hot, I'm hungry.

452
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,894
<i>I felt like I was playing</i>
<i>the physical aspect,</i>

453
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,272
<i>the survival aspect of the game</i>

454
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,029
PROBST:<i> The next morning,</i>
<i>Christy proved</i>

<i>the women could still provide</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,784
CHRISTY:
<i>Today, I kind of felt like,</i>

457
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,662
<i>kind of cool, you know,</i>
<i>and so I go out, I go fishing,</i>

458
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,414
and bam, bam, bam, I catch fish,

459
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,124
and I provide lunch
for the tribe.

460
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,919
<i>And it really does</i>

461
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,421
make you feel good, you know.

462
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,882
It feels good knowing
that you can actually

463
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,217
<i>get food for somebody,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

464
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,761
<i>So we can survive</i>
<i>without Joanna.</i>

465
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,268
Jeanne and Shawna
are commiserating.

466
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,104
Is that like,
discussing, arguing?

467
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:51,523
No, feeling really bad
for each other.

468

"I never would have let you
stay here."

471
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,238
Blah, blah, blah.

CHRISTY:
Commiserating?

473
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,449
DEENA:
Commiserate.

474
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,825
Commiserate.

475
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,954
JEANNE: I'm not going
to roll over and die because

476
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,789
Joanna's not here.

477
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,459
I mean, I think you should have
been voted off.

478
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,419
As much as I love you--
I think you're the greatest kid

479
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,587
in the world, you know I do.

480
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,796
No. Actually, it's a good point.

481
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,964
I know exactly
what you're saying now...

482
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,467
JEANNE: I think we need
as much energy as we can get.

483
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,510
-And you don't have it.
-I agree. I agree.

484
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,139
Maybe the tribe has a plan
that they didn't share with me.

485
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,683
PROBST:<i> Frustrated</i>
<i>by Joanna's departure,</i>

486
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,102

<i>She would like that.</i>

491
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,528
One meatball.

492
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:42,115
<i>I, uh, cooked the fish, and</i>
<i>then they all wanted manioc.</i>

493

<i>And I opened the lid</i>
<i>on our container of manioc,</i>

494

<i>and it contained</i>

495

pink fuzz, green fuzz.

496
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,790
I saw

497
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:54,002
<i>white maggots, ants,</i>
<i>skinny little worms.</i>

498

Good eating.
Good eating, folks.

500
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,384
<i>And I knew how to cook it</i>

501
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,136
<i>I went in, got a little</i>

dipped it

503

Got a little green mold,

505
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,396
<i>little hot dog,</i>
<i>bite-size morsels, and...</i>

506
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,523
<i>kind of dried them slowly</i>
<i>over the ashes.</i>

507
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,317
Meatballs are cooking, girls.

508
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,527
All right!

509
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,238
And they're gonna be... great!

510
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,031
CHRISTY:
Yay.

511
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,866
-We're gonna have a good meal.
-JEANNE: Oh, it's gonna taste

512
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,203
like beef stew
and your mom's biscuits.

513
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,246
They devoured them.

514
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,206
<i>They thought</i>
<i>they were sesame treats.</i>

515
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,457
Excellent.

516
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,835
-God bless you.
-CHRISTY: Mmm, Jeanne!

517
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,336
-This is the ticket.
-DEENA: This really is too good.

518
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,214
I wouldn't eat one
if you paid me.

519
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,924
<i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>they'll all keel over.</i>

520
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,843
<i>-They might.</i>
-Mm, wonderful.

521
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,012
-I could eat this all day.
-Mm-hmm.

522
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,023
PROBST:<i> In the morning,</i>

"The map will show
the place you're after.

526
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,116
Send your youngest

527
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,910
No way. Is that just--
Jenna's going?

528
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,252
PROBST:<i> So Dave and Jenna met</i>
<i>for date night in the jungle.</i>

529
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,379
-JENNA: Oh, my God.
-(Dave laughs)

530
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,922
JENNA:
<i>We were so excited</i>

531
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,216
<i>to actually talk</i>
<i>to someone of the opposite sex.</i>

532
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,762
We were, like, ready
to just, like, chat away.

533
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,097
DAVE:
<i>Jenna did go into great detail</i>

534
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,933
<i>about the status of her tribe.</i>

535
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,436
Heidi, who I've become
really close to...

536
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,979
-I expected that.
-She's, like,

537
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,564
really, really upbeat
all the time,

538
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,441
and Shawna's falling apart.

539
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,609
She doesn't want to be here.

540
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,777

543
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,451

00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,081
Good morning.

547
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,248
-We had fun.
-PROBST: Yeah?

548

-We, really...
-Uh-huh.

549

And we didn't... we didn't
hold back anything.

550
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,920
We told it all.

551
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,630
We pretty much know everything
about each other.

552
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,131
Well, I am glad to hear

553
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,258
that you guys shared
a little bit of information,

554
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,427
and that information's gonna
come in real handy.

555
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,137
We're gonna have a little draft,

556
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,891
and you two are in charge
of picking new tribes.

557
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,813
You go first.

558
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,980
Heidi.

559
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,274
I'm gonna have to pull Alex.

560
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,652
-Butch.
-Deena. Deena by far.

561
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,821
PROBST:<i> When they were done,</i>
<i>Dave had picked Heidi,</i>

562

<i>Christy and Jeanne to join him</i>

563
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,242
Honey, we're home!

564
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,078
PROBST:<i> And Alex, Rob</i>
<i>and Matthew went to Jaburu,</i>

565
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,956
<i>where their arrival had</i>
<i>an immediate impact on Shawna.</i>

566
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,958
-Yay!
-Yeah!

567
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,293
DEENA:<i> It's amazing</i>
<i>what a little bit</i>

568
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,962
<i>of testosterone can do</i>
<i>for somebody.</i>

569
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:47,175
Boys come into the camp, and
Shawna is 180 degrees better.

570
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,343
Hi. (giggles)

571
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,511
How are you?

572
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,679
We all stink really bad. Hey.

573
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,930
Oh, it's okay. How are you?

574
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,849
-ALEX: Good.
-Hey.

575
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,517
-This is nice...
-(indistinct conversation)

576
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,062
PROBST:<i> At Tambaqui, Christy</i>
<i>was made to feel right at home.</i>

577
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,357
CHRISTY:<i> The one thing</i>
<i>I like about this tribe is,</i>

578
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,152
they're very aware that, okay,
we got somebody who's deaf.

579

581
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,198

<i>in the evening conversations,</i>

583
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,245
and make her feel
even more welcome.

584
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,414
I'm just really glad
to be in a group

585
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,708
where this lantern is useful,
you know.

586
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,795
In that Jaburu tribe,
it was never possible.

587
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,880
So I really, you know...

588
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,716
And me feeling comfortable,
I will definitely do,

589
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,260

Don't quit.

some responsibilities

615

I felt like a lot of the other

very tactical and strategic

Okay, you know, Shawna, that
I'm never gonna stop you,

630

-CHRISTY: Um, yeah. Really loud.

-...boom!
-CHRISTY: But some deaf people

652

really overdo it.

653

They add, like, bass,

654
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,057
and like
"a-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom,"

655
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,060
and then they get the techno
music, and it's just, like,

656

"boom, boom, boom"
the whole time.

00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,250
Hold one hand...?

668
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,585
It doesn't matter what hand,

669
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,962
but, um, kind of like, you know.

670
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,049
<i>They said, "Yeah, you know,</i>
<i>it'd be cool if we had</i>

671
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,593
<i>some signs," you know,</i>
<i>or they could learn some signs,</i>

672
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,096
<i>and I was, like, "Yeah, man."</i>

673
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,599
Like, that is so great
that people really want to,

674
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,935
like, learn, 'cause, I mean,

675
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,812
I'm able to
contribute that, you know?

676
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,481
<i>And I was, like, "Okay, so if</i>
<i>we could have a cheer,</i>

677
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,941
<i>"how could</i>
<i>I come up with, like,</i>

678
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,942
<i>a little, like, name thing</i>

679
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,610
<i>for the team?"</i>
<i>And then "Tambaqui..."</i>

680
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,404
-So we got "team."
-Mm-hmm.

681
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,989
-DAVE: I like that.
-Fish-- "Tambaqui."

682
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,783
<i>And they all practiced it, and</i>

683
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,285
they would, like, tap me, and
be, like, "This, or this or...?"

684
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,121
You know?
I'm, like, "Yeah." Fix it up.

685
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,789
-More.
-Did I do it right?

686
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,999
Okay, you're going like this.
Okay, see how I'm doing it?

687
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,960
I'm doing it...
more of like a... Yeah.

688
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,337
Drawing a circle around.

689
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,923
And-And that made me feel
so good.

690
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,341
Just, like, "Yes!"

691
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,135
<i>Tambaqui is my home now.</i>

692
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,636
<i>I think we are a tribe.</i>

693
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,804
I like that.

694
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,055
CHRISTY:
Team Fish.

695
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,140
I like that.

696
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,642
I see no reason why we need
to add anything more.

697
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,817
Survivors ready! Go!

698
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,610
<i>At the immunity challenge,</i>

699
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,655
<i>Tambaqui gnawed their way</i>
<i>to victory.</i>

700
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,324
By a tiny margin,
Tambaqui wins immunity.

701
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,660
(whooping, indistinct chatter)

702
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,706
Tambaqui!

703
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,960
PROBST:<i> So Jaburu went</i>
<i>to Tribal Council,</i>

704
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,714

706

Are you here?

707
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,925

709

711
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,977
<i>Shawna was voted out</i>

712
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,187
SHAWNA:
<i>As a 23-year-old,</i>

713
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,688
I went in thinking, you know,

714
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,814
"Of course I'm a bad-ass,"

715
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,358
<i>and what I found out</i>
<i>in the end was this</i>

716
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,027
<i>total facade that I had,</i>
<i>that I was such a rock.</i>

717
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,031
<i>Well, I'm disappointed that</i>
<i>I physically gave in,</i>

718
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,741
and I got the label of being

719
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,992
kind of a pantywaist,
so, basically,

720
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,536
<i>when it comes down to it,</i>

ROB (imitates computer voice):
"Welcome. You have treemail."

<i>On Day 19, the arrival</i>

725

Dave, Roger, Butch.

734
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,526
Amen to that, "sistah."

735
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,528
Jenna, thanks for
bringing us all together.

736
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,737
-Yeah.
-Oh, no problem.

One for all.

739

PROBST:<i> The tribes paddled</i>

00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,709
<i>they would merge</i>
<i>into one tribe.</i>

742
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,587
You started this as a tribe
of women and a tribe of men.

743
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,258
Today you will form
one final tribe.

744

Jaburu and Tambaqui are no more.

Jacaré...

-Jacaré!
-...which is Portuguese

757

-for "alligator."
-For "caiman."

What we're gonna do--
we're gonna split it up like...

765
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,260
like a calendar

both natural

-Right.

<i>Day One: men versus the women.</i>

This is the hottest girl
I've ever talked to,

778
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,168
even though she's wearing
a retainer all the time.

779
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,295
How about on the days
that there were challenges,

780
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,839
we make... we-we box it out
a little bit like this,

781
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,507
to indicate
what team won the challenge?

782

<i>are pretty creative</i>

783
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,011
<i>about this whole calendar</i>
<i>of events.</i>

784
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,888
We both know,
like, seriously know,

785
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,891
day by day, of what has happened
in both the tribes.

786
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,809
-Okay, so... -You guys won the
challenge, though, then we...

787
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,061
-Then that's blue.
-The box... Blue.

788
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,355
And then you guys won the reward
challenge for the, in the box.

789

-Day Seven.
-Yup.

ROB:
<i>It's very exciting for me</i>

00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,819
that... to have a chance to be

792
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,988
in such close contact
with this girl,

793
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,283
and not have to have
a handful of singles in my hand.

794

-Where did Roger go?
-PROBST:<i> At Jacaré,</i>

<i>the tribe enjoyed getting</i>
<i>acquainted,</i>

<i>but Roger brought an end</i>
<i>to all the fun.</i>

797

ROGER:<i> We had a tendency</i>
<i>to be festive all afternoon,</i>

798
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,427
forgetting the fact that we had
to get a shelter built.

CHRISTY: Um, can I start
putting the floorboards down?

800
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,396
ROGER: Well, we got that...
we have that under control.

801
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,565
Helping Rob split the fronds
would be really great.

802
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,526
Okay? Can you lift...?

803
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,237
CHRISTY:
<i>I'm not working on the shelter,</i>

804
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,405
which really pisses me off
because

805
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,739
I really would like
to be a part it.

806
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,740
PROBST:
<i>Roger felt</i>

ROGER:<i> Yeah, we got six guys</i>

the six guys against...

against, the, uh...
against the girls,

812
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,461

DEENA: But you understand
what we have to do.

815
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,802
We have to start
picking off the stronger males.

816
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,929
Yeah, but please
let Roger go first, please.

817
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,597
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, no...

818
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,141
I don't care
what you want after that, but...

819
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,936
-DEENA: No.
-But then after Roger, who?

820
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,229
I don't know,
but he's got to go.

821
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,606
ALEX:
<i>Roger is of the belief</i>

All right, I've had it.

828
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,373

<i>Roger felt safe...</i>

835
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,439
You gotta feel
a little bit confident.

836
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,649
I would say, yeah,
I-I probably do.

837
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,651
You know, obviously,
if I really felt

838
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:35,114
that I needed that immunity,
I would have given it my all.

839
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,200
PROBST:
<i>...and was blindsided</i>

840
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:40,161

841
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,330
ROGER:
<i>I was a cocky...</i>

842
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,248
<i>You know, and I still am.</i>

843
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,959
<i>You never lose</i>
<i>that self-confidence,</i>

844
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,669
<i>that positive, you know?</i>

845
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,465
I'm a Type-A personality;
I am a leader, I don't sit back.

846
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,760
I'm opinionated, and that never

847
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,761
<i>goes away.</i>

848
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,721
Roger, the tribe has spoken.

849
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,058
ROGER:
<i>I came to win the game, but</i>

850
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,184
I wasn't deceptive enough.

851
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,354
<i>I should've bit my tongue</i>
<i>and laid low.</i>

852
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,357
<i>I should've not exuded</i>
<i>that confidence.</i>

853
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,359
And, uh, I've no one
to blame but myself.

854
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,361
<i>They were better</i>
<i>than I am at the game.</i>

855
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,538
PROBST:<i> The next morning, Dave</i>
<i>pondered his new situation.</i>

856
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,498
DAVE:
<i>What happened last night</i>

857
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,917
<i>was an interesting turn</i>
<i>of events.</i>

858
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,836
<i>All my stability and everything</i>

859
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,547
<i>has now been</i>
<i>turned upside down,</i>

860
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,217
<i>because I did put my roots</i>
<i>into an alliance with Roger.</i>

861
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,010
<i>Now...</i>

862
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,264
I gotta play the game according
to how things are right now.

863
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,765
PROBST:
<i>Dave tried to prove</i>

864
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,184
<i>he was still valuable</i>
<i>to the tribe.</i>

865
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,228
DAVE:<i> Hopefully, just being</i>
<i>a hard worker and dedicated,</i>

866
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,397
<i>motivated and fun to be with</i>

867
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,607
will keep me around
for a little bit longer

868
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,192
<i>and start building, uh,</i>
<i>some alliances</i>

869
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,236
<i>with the people who are left.</i>

870
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,530
PROBST:<i> That evening,</i>
<i>while tending the fire,</i>

871
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,614
<i>Dave pleaded his case</i>

872
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,285
<i>to Christy and tried</i>
<i>to swing her vote.</i>

873
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:06,539
I felt guilty in a lot
of the way I acted at Tambaqui.

874
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,874
That's kind of why I wanted

875
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,792
to have fire duty
with you tonight.

876
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,129
(whispering): I voted for you
last time and I felt bad.

877
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>You know, at my point,</i>

878
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,424
<i>it's cleaning the slate,</i>
<i>making sure</i>

879
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,301
<i>that nobody's harboring</i>
<i>any hard feelings,</i>

880
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,387
and, uh, also, you know,
maybe get a vote or two.

881
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,724
I'm a little stronger than
some people, so I'm competition.

882
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,267
Yeah.

883
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,436
People want to get rid of me.

884
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,647
And, uh, it kind of sucks.

885
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,815
<i>Shortly thereafter,</i>

886
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,525
<i>Christy said how much</i>
<i>she loved to dance.</i>

887
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,110
I happen to also like to dance,

888
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,654
and when I asked her
if she knew how to swing dance,

889
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,740
she responded that she only knew
how to salsa.

890
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,575
(whispering):
Swing dancing is on six beats

891
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,035
instead of four beats, right?

892
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,453
Okay.

893
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,621
DAVE:
<i>So I took the opportunity</i>

894
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,747
to teach her
a little swing dancing.

895
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,460
-(snoring) -DAVE: The guy leads,
and the girl follows,

896
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,462
and it has to work like that,

897
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,423
because if we both try to lead,
it's not gonna work.

898
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,633
-(Christy whispers)
-Right.

899
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,968
So, in this case,
it works pretty good

900
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,637
'cause I know what I'm doing,

901
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,347
and you don't know
what you're doing.

902
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,933
So, for you,
the beat is one, two...

903
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,480
All right.

904
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,315
Over here, like this.

905
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,156
-Piece of cake, right?
No problem? -Yeah.

906
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,200
So now that we got that...

907
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,746
Or we can do this.

908
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,715
Yeah. Not too bad.

909
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,883
Yeah.

910
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,052
CHRISTY:<i> It was a fun</i>
<i>fire watch, you know?</i>

911
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,345
<i>It was entertaining.</i>

912
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,847
<i>Dave, in general, seemed</i>
<i>like a really good guy,</i>

913
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:51,102
<i>but I-I think he was</i>
<i>exaggerating a little bit</i>

914
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,354
<i>on how much</i>
<i>he really appreciates me.</i>

915
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,690
That's it.
So now you're a pro.

916
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,566
CHRISTY:<i> If you really</i>
<i>appreciate me,</i>

917
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,152
maybe you could show that
a little bit throughout the game

918
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,362
instead of, like, the day before

919
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,030
you think you're going
to get voted off.

920
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,871
PROBST:<i> At the immunity</i>
<i>challenge, Dave needed to win.</i>

921
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,331
It's payback.

922
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,542
PROBST:
<i>But his hopes were smashed</i>

923
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,835
<i>when he was taken out early.</i>

924
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,338
<i>Jenna was</i>
<i>the last one standing.</i>

925
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:24,010
<i>So at Tribal Council, Dave made</i>
<i>a final plea to the tribe.</i>

926
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,720
DAVE:
These next three days

927
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,930
are... are important
to me, and, um,

928
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,224
and I would like to spend them
with the-the eight people

929
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,892
that are sitting down
here in front of me.

930
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,227
PROBST:
<i>But it wasn't enough,</i>

931
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,063
<i>as eight votes made him</i>
<i>the first member of the jury.</i>

932
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,024
DAVE:<i> I guess that's what</i>
<i>really kind of caught me</i>

933
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,234
<i>surprised when I finally</i>
<i>realized that,</i>

934
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,403
you know,
I am perceived as a threat.

935
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,780
<i>It was, "Wait a minute.</i>
<i>Now I'm the bad guy."</i>

936
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,074
Dave, the tribe has spoken.

937
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:51,287
DAVE:<i> My case is a prime example</i>
<i>how it is very difficult</i>

938
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,999
to plan any more
than a few days in advance.

939
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,919
<i>I miscalculated and found</i>
<i>myself walking on thin ice,</i>

940
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,797
<i>and it broke and sent me home.</i>

941
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,429
PROBST:<i> By Day 25, the alliance</i>
<i>of Deena, Rob, Alex,</i>

942
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,931
<i>Jenna and Heidi started</i>
<i>to unravel.</i>

943
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,309
DEENA: Heidi, tell me
how well you think

944
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,227
you're gonna be able
to advance if-if Matt

945
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,604
or Alex is in this game?

946
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,813
Matt's not in the picture.

947
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,231
I understand that.

948
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,525
What if Matt wins immunity
tomorrow?

949
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:28,991
It seems to me, if Matt wins
immunity, then Alex has to go.

950

and I knew she'd speak
to Alex about it.

956
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,258
She's... turned on us.

957
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,011
So, we need to get her off.

958
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,472
Deena stabbed us all in the back
because she's being selfish.

959
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,973
I'm really pissed at her.

960

<i>Backed into a corner,</i>

961

<i>Alex decided</i>
<i>to turn the tables on Deena.</i>

962
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,978
And so I grab Rob,

963
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:58,854
"Rob, dude, what's going on?"

964
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,815
She wants you done
sooner than later.

965

You know what?
Here's my plan then.

966
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,152
We keep Christy,
and we keep Butch.

967
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,113
