1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,180
It is one of the most amazing 
places in the world.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,180
Crystal clear waters,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,980
a varied and dangerous fauna

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,520
and hundreds of 
breathtaking islands.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,060
This will be the battlefield

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,060
from a culture war 
to the Survivor.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,540
These 20 Americans don't know it yet,

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,670
but they are about 
to be separated into two tribes.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,350
Generation Y,

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,480
18 years old

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,700
at 31 years old.

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,050
For my generation,

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,710
what matters 
is doing what you want.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,300
And I did a lot.

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,820
Beekeeper, beer brewer, 
snowboard teacher,

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,750
I went 
to North Dakota...

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,320
I'm definitely the Peter Pan type.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,710
I will never grow up.

20
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,750
I am like this. 
I can not change.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,930
I earn my living 
by playing online video games.

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,030
To adults, we say all the time,

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,020
"Grow up, stop playing, 
it's not a game.", but...

24
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,230
I want my whole life 
to revolve around gaming.

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,750
Survivor is the ultimate game.

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,870
And I will win it.

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,680
The stereotype of young people is,

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,120
always on social networks, 
always on Twitter.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,330
But I don't like 
being glued to my phone.

30
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,220
I really don't like 
technology.

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,240
Twitter is the worst thing 
ever invented.

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,550
Well, I'm on Twitter, 
but it's still horrible.

33
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,930
Generation X,

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,790
aged 33

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,230
at 52 years old.

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,460
I am a lawyer,

37
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,700
I am 38 years old.

38
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,520
And I know the older ones 
are actually listening to you.

39
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,670
They use their experiences.

40
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,380
If you've already been knocked down,

41
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,440
you know how to get up 
and fight.

42
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,240
I have four children

43
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,680
and I'm surprised 
by the 25-year-old kids

44
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,260
living with their parents, 
always on video games.

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,830
I feel like 
they're more like

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,200
"time will tell".

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,670
"It takes me seven years 
to finish school? So what?

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,990
My parents pay."

49
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,870
I write for television.

50
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,530
It took me 14 years of purgatory 
as an assistant

51
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,170
to finally become an author.

52
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,240
And I doubt the younger ones would 
spend so much time

53
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,880
to their dream, whatever it may be.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,880
They would find themselves another dream.

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,710
two generations

56
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,680
with two very different ways 
of approaching life.

57
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,610
They will be abandoned 
and left to fend for themselves.

58
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,960
They must learn to adapt 
or they will be eliminated.

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,290
In the end, only one will take home 
the million dollar prize.

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,550
39 days,

61
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,090
20 people,

62
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,960
a survivor.

63
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,280
Good ! Welcome 
to the 33rd season of Survivor.

64
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,760
Take your name, 
don't open it yet,

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,030
wait for me.

66
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,980
Very exciting time.

67
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,130
Which tribe will I be in?

68
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,780
All right, unpack all your bandanas.

69
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,640
Take a seat on your mat

70
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,810
and greet your new companions.

71
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,850
If you're purple, 
go purple.

72
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,610
If you are orange, 
go orange.

73
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,450
Put on all your bandanas.

74
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,230
It's not official

75
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,270
than when the bandana 
is somewhere on your body.

76
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm so happy 
to have this thing on my head!

77
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,380
Well then.

78
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,580
Once again, 
Survivor shakes things up.

79
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,780
This year it's Survivor, 
Gen Y versus Gen X.

80
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,560
I thought, "Damn,

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,690
clearly, 
it is a war of generations.

82
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,680
From the start, we tear each other apart.

83
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,960
That's crazy !

84
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,750
May the best generation win!

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,490
Gen X, born between 1963

86
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,230
Old !

87
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,540
Gen Y, born between 1984 and 1997.

88
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,330
This division

89
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,710
is deeper 
than just "old versus young".

90
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,850
They are two very different philosophies of life .

91
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,580
What we will test this season 
is which is better suited

92
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,150
in the game of Survivor.

93
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,080
Someone among Gen Y

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,820
does he want to assume he was born in 1997, 
the youngest person?

95
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,720
Without hesitation ! 
What's your name ?

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,290
- Will. 
- 1997. How old are you?

97
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,730
- Do you have your baccalaureate? 
- No, still in high school.

98
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,900
I left high school 
to play this game.

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,110
- I'm ready to play! 
- Graduate first !

100
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,080
It's a first !

101
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,880
Our first high school student.

102
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,950
Good. And does anyone among Gen X 
want to assume

103
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,240
being born in 1963, 
which makes him the oldest?

104
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,710
What's your name ?

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,140
- Paul. 
- Paul.

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,560
So, Paul, how does it feel

107
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,260
to live in this environment 
where at one time, Generation X

108
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,670
tear down the walls

109
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,310
and rebuild the culture?

110
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,700
Now you are the oldest, 
and the next generation is coming.

111
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,170
In our generation,

112
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,270
there was no trophy 
without winning.

113
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,040
In our generation,

114
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,440
only the winners 
had a trophy.

115
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,530
We had to do without an iPod, 
an app for this, an app for that.

116
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,940
You had to go to the store 
to buy milk.

117
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,550
It was not delivered by drone.

118
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,750
Madam, in front, what is your name?

119
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,590
- What what. 
- What what.

120
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
You nodded, "Yes, yes!"

121
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,060
Absolutely.

122
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,520
They do not work,

123
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,060
we give them everything.

124
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,210
You have to work 
to get what you want.

125
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,560
This is how you can truly 
know success.

126
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,410
- The guy in the middle, your name? 
- Adam.

127
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,510
Good. Adam.

128
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,660
You see what I mean ?

129
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,280
So, you hear that, this is how 
we sum up Generation Y.

130
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,880
"Participation trophies", 
"We don't want to work"...

131
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,420
Does that seem true to you?

132
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,760
I do not think so.

133
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,940
When we win 
the first immunity,

134
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,120
we'll see who has to work to win.

135
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,320
Good. You are about to pass 
your first test.

136
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Scattered in this piece of jungle

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,900
find 
helpful articles for the next 39 days.

138
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,610
Some have 
short-term value,

139
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,710
others a long-term value.

140
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,570
Moreover, each tribe

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,350
has two positions.

142
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,140
You will choose an item

143
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,900
at each position.

144
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,080
Leave the other where he is.

145
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,490
These will be your first 
big decisions in the game.

146
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,050
Are you ready to go?

147
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,250
So, forward!

148
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,460
Quick !

149
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,660
Forward, Gen Y!

150
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,380
You have two minutes

151
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,070
to bring as many as possible 
to your carpet.

152
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
If it's on your mat, 
it's up to you.

153
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,770
The friends !

154
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,890
"Choose one."

155
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,320
We need that.

156
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,420
Gen X 
make their first decision.

157
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,680
They take the pan 
and the utensils

158
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,710
and leave the hammer where it is.

159
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,390
You make decisions

160
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,760
that will influence 
the next 39 days.

161
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,330
There are things to find 
in every corner!

162
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,210
- Hammer and nails? 
- You can cook in bamboo.

163
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,340
Les Gen Y,

164
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,530
half the tribe 
for a single decision!

165
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,810
Someone decide, 
no need to all be there!

166
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,090
Some are already coming back.

167
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,610
Take all you can!

168
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,150
There are articles in the trees, 
others at the foot of the trees.

169
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,580
Don't forget anything.

170
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,930
Quick quick !

171
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,020
On the ground, there was an envelope.

172
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,370
I caught her,

173
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,430
stashed behind my back 
and I continued.

174
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,870
It was a moment where you said to yourself, 
"My God! I have to continue!"

175
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,270
But my heart was pounding, 
because it had to be a good thing.

176
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,080
- Take the gear. 
- I'm taking care of it.

177
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,000
Gen X 
take the fishing gear

178
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,930
and leave the chickens.

179
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,170
30 seconds left!

180
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,320
Bring what you want 
on your mat!

181
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,660
Adam, let's go!

182
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,800
Come back and get 
some if you've laid everything!

183
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,930
Hey, them Gén Y!

184
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,440
The chickens. The chickens.

185
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,120
15 seconds left! 
Come back, that's it!

186
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,220
Gen Y took the chickens

187
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,850
and left the fishing gear.

188
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,920
Big difference right away.

189
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,000
Gen X think long term.

190
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,240
Gen Y think in the short term.

191
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,840
Latest post!

192
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
End of time!

193
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,970
It's finish ! Put down your items 
and come back to your mat!

194
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,570
The chickens ? Good choice !

195
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,870
Let's recap the big picks.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,210
You took 
the fishing gear.

197
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,410
Paul, why prefer 
him to chickens,

198
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,080
which are ready to be eaten?

199
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,270
Fishing gear is... 
39 days.

200
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,460
This is the most important item 
we took.

201
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,690
Taylor. You 
guys took the chickens.

202
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,430
Why ?

203
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,330
They lay eggs, Jeff!

204
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,200
Good.

205
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,440
Let's go. 
Gen X, the map

206
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
to reach your beach!

207
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,130
Les Gen Y,

208
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,120
the map to reach your beach!

209
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,810
Before I release you...

210
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,110
It's hurricane season.

211
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,420
Here in Fiji.

212
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,150
It was tough.

213
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,620
We are in a hollow here.

214
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,620
Another heavy storm is expected 
soon.

215
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
It's not sham, 
it's for real.

216
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,960
This season more than any other,

217
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,760
you must attack your shelter 
immediately on the camp,

218
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,300
because you will need it.

219
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,300
Take your things, let's go! 
Good luck !

220
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,590
Generation Y versus Generation X.

221
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,670
It's a war of generations.

222
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,740
I guarantee some 
in this Gen X tribe

223
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,780
said exactly 
the same thing as me,

224
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,720
"It's the best generation 
ever."

225
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,180
Our sweet home!

226
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,850
Walk along this beach 
and see the tribe's flag...

227
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,720
Everyone is super excited,

228
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,470
very happy to meet.

229
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,510
And we're going to make the clichés lie

230
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,010
on Generation Y.

231
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,480
We take a walk, everyone says their name?

232
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,190
My name is Figgy. 
My real name is Jessica, but...

233
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,720
I am 23 years old

234
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,330
and I'm a bartender.

235
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,000
My name is Mari

236
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,160
and I make a living playing video games.

237
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,790
In good Gen Y,

238
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,400
we touch everything.

239
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,740
Nobody has an ordinary job. 
I think it's great.

240
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,910
My name is Michelle, I'm 28 years old

241
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,770
and I do missionary work

242
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,870
for an organization 
that translates the Bible.

243
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,210
Yeah !

244
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,020
I clearly think 
that our tribe and our generation

245
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,790
see things 
completely differently.

246
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,010
And as Gen Y, 
that's a huge plus.

247
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,930
Let's take some bamboo stalks 
to form the base.

248
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,930
You have to be above the ground.

249
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,450
Go to work !

250
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,410
- I like... 
- Yeah, everyone here looks serious.

251
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,510
I have a great tribe.

252
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,710
I have a very good contact with Jay.

253
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,540
He has a very cool haircut

254
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,880
and he's a real friend, I can see that.

255
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,680
With him, I will get along easily.

256
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,770
We're putting a beam 
between the trees around here.

257
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,860
I had thought of that earlier, but...

258
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,100
- But if... 
- Oh, you're so smart!

259
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,790
You are so intelligent!

260
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,260
And I clearly get 
along with Figgs,

261
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,490
because she is downright cute.

262
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,500
I will make the fire.

263
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,240
Do you have wires in your pockets? 
It would take right away.

264
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,560
- Soggy. 
- Yeah, we're all soaked.

265
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,380
Hair ? 
It would take!

266
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,250
- One of your braids! 
- The Jedi Braid!

267
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,250
Also, Michelle is cool.

268
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,320
And they are both pretty.

269
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,820
And I like pretty girls.

270
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,160
So I already have a connection 
with those people.

271
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,350
- I'm so excited! 
- That's crazy !

272
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,670
I am appalled. 
I'm with a bunch of Gen Ys.

273
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,480
I'm 28, but to be honest,

274
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,800
I never referred to myself 
as a "Gen Y". Never.

275
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,660
I'm not dressed 
for the youth parade,

276
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,340
but for the "meetings" night 
at the Miami retirement home.

277
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,970
Like, I'm actually 80 years old.

278
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,170
It's like tidying up my room!

279
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,210
Like, "Oh no! 
Where's that going?"

280
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,900
I am in a tribe of children.

281
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,450
When I saw all these kids 
around me,

282
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,180
I thought, "You know what those kids 
never had?

283
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,320
A real job."

284
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,050
Let's go bowling!

285
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,990
They don't know how to do anything!

286
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,300
- To the youth! 
- I love you all !

287
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,240
Our sweet home, friends!

288
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,050
Great job, everyone!

289
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,890
I expect Gen X 
to be Gen X,

290
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,660
that they are people 
of my caliber.

291
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,980
People my age work hard.

292
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,440
They have strong 
family values.

293
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,400
strong opinions,

294
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,180
but based on a solid 
decision-making process.

295
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,240
Hey, friends! 
One moment, huh?

296
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,300
Being the oldest

297
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,880
I would just like to say...

298
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,990
When Jeff said how 
the tribes would be made up,

299
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,220
it changed everything.

300
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,550
From top to bottom.

301
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,220
It went from, 
"Wow, as long as it's not..."

302
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,650
to, "Damn, there are 
thinking people here!

303
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,880
Who know how to build, who know..."

304
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,870
We are also a generation 
that has been taught humility.

305
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,260
These kids shouldn't be underestimated . They are lively, gifted...

306
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,770
We grew up 
working with our hands.

307
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,530
They work with their minds. 
Don't underestimate them.

308
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,880
Underestimate your enemy 
and you'll get your ass kicked.

309
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,230
- [???] 
- Shall we get on the shelter?

310
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,880
Let's go!

311
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,710
Let's take advantage of the daylight.

312
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,540
I spent the last five years

313
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,190
away from it all, in the Maui jungle.

314
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,540
So when it comes to setting up camp, 
getting to know the environment,

315
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,530
find food, all that...

316
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,530
Let me help you on that.

317
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,730
It's like it's my home.

318
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,930
I want to help, guide my team 
in the direction that I consider necessary.

319
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,340
The beach is on this side.

320
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,380
But do this by supporting them 
and putting them in a good mood,

321
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,400
and that they know they 
can count on me.

322
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,410
Shall we form a group 
to bring back all this gear?

323
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,110
- Let's go! 
- We're making an A-frame for the shelter?

324
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,050
This area is nice.

325
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,900
Yes. If you could 
take this debris

326
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,340
and pile them up...

327
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,120
Once dry, it can be used 
as kindling.

328
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,030
When I was running 
to collect items,

329
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,700
I found something 
in a nice envelope.

330
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,150
Need more bamboo?

331
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Yeah.

332
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,430
It's Survivor. It could be 
a lot of wonderful things.

333
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,610
And I don't want to 
be found with,

334
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,240
because I think 
that would make me a target.

335
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,290
"Congratulations, you have found 
The Heir's Advantage.

336
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,450
If you have this message 
on the 36th day,

337
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,340
you will receive 
an advantage in the game.

338
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,990
If you are eliminated,

339
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,620
you will have to bequeath it 
to another player."

340
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,780
It's the first time in Survivor

341
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,090
that there is this Heir Advantage.

342
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,650
If I'm still here on the 36th day,

343
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,030
I will receive an advantage in the game.

344
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,860
This is a good thing.

345
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,970
And I will be there on the 36th day.

346
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,070
So no one but me 
will have this.

347
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,620
I want to baptize one of the chickens.

348
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,190
I don't want to call him Tai, 
otherwise I won't be able to kill him.

349
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,480
Can you help me with the chickens?

350
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,660
At home, 
I am the center of attention.

351
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,060
I like to flirt.

352
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,200
And I'm good 
at manipulating men.

353
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,890
I risk splitting my head!

354
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,380
People think 
I'm just a pretty face,

355
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,470
they don't know 
the brain behind it.

356
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,180
I might end up making 
the million AND getting myself a husband.

357
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,400
Did you see 
the cocos we brought back?

358
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,810
- There are other things to bring. 
- On the beach ?

359
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,290
On and goes?

360
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,330
Where is everyone? 
I do not like it.

361
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,960
- I do not like it. Where are they ? 
- They're looking for idols.

362
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,300
Seriously !

363
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,670
But seriously, where are they?

364
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,430
I don't like separation. 
I like to know where everyone is.

365
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,100
You, him and me, 
it works between us, there.

366
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,520
Yeah, I know.

367
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,690
We need, like, three more, 
but we're out of the question.

368
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,940
No, I know, me neither, but...

369
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,440
Join the discussion!

370
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,060
We three are welded.

371
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,630
Jay and I 
had a connection from the start.

372
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,690
Then Taylor is my 
blue-eyed hottie,

373
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,510
and I find it too crunchy.

374
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,570
I'm tired, my hands are shaking.

375
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,050
Biceps, buddy!

376
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,320
And I knew 
that these two boys were close.

377
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,730
So of course, I want to be in it, 
it's going to be solid.

378
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,740
We're invincible, 
we're, like... The Triforce!

379
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,900
I love Taylor.

380
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,100
Taylor is my buddy. 
I can tell

381
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,350
because he's like my friends 
at home.

382
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,910
It's like, "Hey, 
the waves are nice, let's go!"

383
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,160
Michelle is with us or what? 
Because she...

384
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,040
- Who is Michelle? 
- The one who travels and...

385
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,630
- Namaste? 
- The Christian.

386
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,940
Yeah, she's with us.

387
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,890
Besides, Figgy is cool.

388
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,420
this is my band,

389
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,750
I really like them, 
they're great.

390
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,470
Who do you feel good?

391
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
You me...

392
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,330
- Him, cool. 
- Cool.

393
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,270
But you and me, that's for sure.

394
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,440
And then I have Namaste, 
whose name is actually Michelle.

395
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,910
I know we're cool.

396
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,250
And she's super good too, 
by the way. Super good.

397
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,000
You know ? I hate to hear, 
"I slept like a baby.",

398
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,880
because I have known babies

399
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,700
and they don't sleep at all!

400
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,260
They sleep very badly!

401
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,530
I look around, 
and it makes me nervous to see

402
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,860
all the beautiful faces 
of "Kappa Kappa Survivor",

403
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,370
because I don't want to be 
the obvious first eliminated.

404
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,890
But it's hard when 
you don't fit in immediately.

405
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,110
I'm still trying 
to remember all the names.

406
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,420
Me too.

407
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,760
- Michelle. 
- Michelle, okay.

408
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,190
So you're doing missionary 
for the Bible?

409
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,910
It's nice.

410
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,240
- It's cool. 
- Actually, I'm a recruiter.

411
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,410
How do you approach people?

412
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,690
"Do you like Bibles? That's it!"

413
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,690
I'm just a Jewess 
who doesn't know anything about the Bible!

414
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,020
I think I am seen 
as a sincere person,

415
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,450
no doubt by my faith, 
by my belief.

416
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,990
So people approach me.

417
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,900
I created a little bond with Jay.

418
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,700
And Hannah told me 
she would trust me.

419
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,200
And in this game, 
trust you,

420
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,770
to be seen as someone 
who cares about others,

421
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,600
it is very beneficial.

422
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,820
You and me, we're doing fine.

423
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,880
- Do we dig and build from there? 
- Alright, let's do this.

424
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,090
How deep 
do you want this hole to be?

425
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,820
I think we should...

426
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,560
- How far do you want to dig? 
- Not too deep.

427
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,950
Afterwards, I would like to put... 
You can leave that.

428
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,270
What is "not too deep"?

429
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,290
I need two [???] 
and small pieces of [???].

430
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,880
That's not 15 cm. 
We have to dig some more.

431
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,010
You see ?

432
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,580
- We're in business here! 
- In effect.

433
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,560
You like to play more than work.

434
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,090
You you you !

435
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,570
You like to laugh.

436
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,900
I have to keep him focused!

437
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
Really ?

438
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,170
Rachel wants too much.

439
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,170
She is too confrontational.

440
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,840
In a forming group,

441
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,690
it can bring 
a lot of negativity.

442
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,240
And people don't like that.

443
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,440
Are you gonna do 
what you were supposed to do,

444
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,440
namely to collect wood 
for the fire?

445
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,110
I think you and me 
should take the machete

446
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,330
and we build this damn thing, 
because it's a lot of talk, but...

447
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,990
I know, I will.

448
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,940
We need four corners, 
obviously.

449
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,790
And I think it takes one 
in the middle of each side, that's six.

450
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,990
Honestly, I've never 
built a shelter before.

451
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,240
But I'm good 
at following orders and...

452
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,770
Welcome to the club !

453
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,040
I don't like sleeping outside, 
bugs or the sun.

454
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,170
I don't like water or the ocean.

455
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,880
All of these things are horrible.

456
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,950
What I like is strategy, that's 
what I'm here for.

457
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,350
- Do we just knock on it? 
- Yeah, let's knock!

458
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,250
Wow, that hits well!

459
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,380
Just there ?

460
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,560
Yeah, right after the join.

461
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,960
Dave is afraid of his shadow.

462
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,920
I was cutting a bamboo

463
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,160
and he was jumping and covering 
his ears, like, it's too loud!

464
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,570
Cover your ears!

465
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,200
Dave better toughen up.

466
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,310
The girls at camp 
have more testosterone than him!

467
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,670
It's almost there. 
Not complicated, right?

468
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,230
I believe 
they have found the immunity idol.

469
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
Why ?

470
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,280
They had 
something in their hands and...

471
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,620
I think they have it.

472
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,090
- Who is it ? 
- It's... Ken and Paul.

473
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,120
- You think ? 
- Yes.

474
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,350
We should intercept them. 
What do you say ? Is it weird?

475
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,800
Better we all know 
that than suspect it.

476
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,990
- I doubt. Why do you believe that? 
- That thing in his left hand.

477
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,260
- He doesn't hide it. 
- Clearly.

478
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,640
He plays the innocent, 
he doesn't want it to show.

479
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,140
No, they would have fled 
into the woods. I can not believe.

480
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,860
I don't want to be paranoid.

481
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,900
But that's downright suspicious.

482
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,210
Keep an eye on his hand, and if he comes back 
with something that looks like [???]...

483
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,740
He will come back with nothing.

484
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,530
Yes, that's what I'm saying. 
If he comes back with something...

485
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,150
If he comes back with nothing, 
he has an idol.

486
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,600
Dave was very paranoid.

487
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,230
He is afraid.

488
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,190
He is also funny, sometimes, 
and also quite charming.

489
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,070
I like you, I trust you, 
I hope it's mutual.

490
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,860
If I hear your name mentioned, 
I'll tell you.

491
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,220
Chris! Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris! 
I believe in you. OK ?

492
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,360
I believe in you. If I hear 
your name mentioned, I'm coming to see you.

493
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,460
Please do the same for me. 
I'll try to find out what's going on.

494
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,180
Stay cool.

495
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,740
No. Everything is fine.

496
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,560
The paranoia started.

497
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,360
He does way too much.

498
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,960
He stirs things up 
and talks strategy.

499
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,460
I think it's too early 
to go all the way there.

500
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,430
It's funny, though.

501
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,330
- The game is started. 
- I say !

502
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,830
He's a little paranoid, 
it makes me a little nervous.

503
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,300
The wind picks up.

504
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,160
I don't know if that's a good sign.

505
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,970
It's not the moment.

506
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,710
- Should we pick him up? 
- Yeah.

507
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,840
As the first night approaches,

508
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,070
I'm very nervous because...

509
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,100
Our shelter is disaster!

510
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,720
We don't really have a roof,

511
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,920
but everyone here thinks

512
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,650
that everything will be fine.

513
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,630
Do we get naked? Nope !

514
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,280
Oh my God !

515
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,430
Believe my experience, 
not a good idea!

516
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,890
I say. I do not want...

517
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,130
But we are Gen Y, who cares!

518
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,930
Everyone is very excited,

519
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,980
very happy to get to know 
the others.

520
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,170
Alright, let's have a blast, kids!

521
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,580
I look at the sky, it's darkening

522
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,120
and it will only get worse.

523
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,980
But no one seems to care.

524
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,350
Come on, team!

525
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,030
The difference 
between Gen X and Gen Y,

526
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,730
is that Gen Xers believe 
in spending time

527
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,890
to achieve its goals.

528
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,720
Gen Y don't believe it.

529
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,010
They think 
if we set a goal

530
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,930
and that we are not afraid to dream, 
we can realize it now.

531
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,490
I don't know what they are doing. 
Mom says, "Come back now!"

532
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,980
Our projects are all half finished.

533
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,450
We were partying on the beach, 
we realized it was getting darker.

534
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,550
We came back in a hurry,

535
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,330
because the shelter was not built.

536
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,960
Come on, guys, 
I need some palm fronds!

537
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,190
Here is one.

538
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,920
We tried to install 
palm fronds,

539
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,390
to keep us dry, 
we thought the rain was coming.

540
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,550
We were rushing to build the shelter, 
Jay and I trying to put the roof together.

541
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,410
It was clearly one of the worst shelters 
in Survivor history.

542
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,400
Be careful !

543
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,080
We all went into the shelter,

544
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,910
but with the weight, it sank.

545
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,890
How are you ?

546
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,040
- Nope. Oh my God ! 
- [???]

547
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,310
Oh no ! Apparently 
there is a weight limit.

548
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,780
And it ended up crashing.

549
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,730
I thought to myself, "No chance

550
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,350
that we finish the shelter in time."

551
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,100
I'm a little scared

552
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,230
that our shelter 
is not yet one.

553
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,000
I know it's not finished, but...

554
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,710
It is a work in progress.

555
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,290
It will be fine. 
We will survive this night.

556
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,800
We are doomed !

557
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,200
It's going to be horrible!

558
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,280
What's going on ?

559
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,330
We were terrified, 
because it was the flood

560
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,030
and we had no shelter.

561
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,500
We were sitting in the rain, 
freezing.

562
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,830
It's the worst thing I've ever known

563
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,590
the longest night of my life. 
I was shaking.

564
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,140
You could feel people 
breaking down mentally.

565
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,140
We believe it will never end.

566
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,910
We heard

567
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,180
rumblings, 
thunder and lightning,

568
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,840
and we saw the storm,

569
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,770
in the distance on the water, 
approaching us.

570
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,900
Like monsters 
coming to catch us

571
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,020
and punish us

572
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,750
for not having built a shelter.

573
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,480
It doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.

574
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,950
We must continue.

575
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,470
- I think they should be cut. 
- Yeah.

576
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,310
What a rotten day.

577
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,970
My hands are...

578
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,240
- I can't do anything about it. 
- Look at mine!

579
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,950
Oh, damn it! 
Do not say that.

580
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,390
We spent a night in hell.

581
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,320
It seems so easy, with you!

582
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,330
We didn't finish our shelter in time 
and it started to rain.

583
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, my God, it's so cold!

584
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,590
And it never stopped.

585
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,780
And it never stopped!

586
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,560
And it never stopped 
raining!

587
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,900
And it's still raining!

588
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,370
Oh yeah, that one is twisted.

589
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,610
This sheet 
is not terrible either, sorry.

590
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,280
- The mail ! 
- The mail !

591
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,320
- And a package! 
- Oh, Lord!

592
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,400
It's big! Is it a tarp?

593
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,490
It's probably four tarps.

594
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,930
The mail ! Come on all of you,

595
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,460
it's the first !

596
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,660
- Some mail ! 
- Is it a tarp?

597
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,990
Mail is cool, 
but I want to see this.

598
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,330
"It's an unusually strong storm

599
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,860
and it will last.

600
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,420
I know you have 
n't had time to build a shelter,

601
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,870
so as a gesture of goodwill, 
receive the protection of this tarpaulin

602
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,280
until you can 
protect yourselves.

603
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,560
When the rain stops, 
bring me the tarp.

604
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,600
If I have to come and pick her up, 
it'll cost you more than a tarp.

605
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,650
Good luck, 
and try to stay dry.

606
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,820
I don't think they knew 
what was coming.

607
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,220
Do we put it above the leaves?

608
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,560
I don't remember a tribe

609
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,100
has ever received a tarp.

610
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,920
We hang it here, like this?

611
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,690
We'll see 
what some are made of.

612
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,090
It's going to be a tough season 
of Survivor, in my opinion.

613
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,480
This time 
will be something for which

614
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,510
none of us are ready.

615
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,930
"As a gesture of goodwill, 
receive the protection of this tarpaulin

616
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,350
until you can 
protect yourselves.

617
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,660
Good luck, 
and try to stay dry.

618
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,420
Big hugs, Jeff."

619
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,290
He does not say "big kisses"!

620
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,120
You know it's bad 
if Jeff gives you a tarp.

621
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,190
You don't even have to earn it, 
it arrives in the mail.

622
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,840
That's also when we knew 
the weather was going to get worse.

623
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,360
So we have a job.

624
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,680
Alright, you wanna 
tear it all up on the shelter?

625
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,270
Put that up there.

626
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,030
Watch your head!

627
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,890
I would rank our camp 
at the "pig barn" level.

628
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,580
It's just a puddle of mud

629
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,950
with bits of bamboo

630
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,660
planted haphazardly.

631
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,020
And I'm like, "Great. 
We're building the base, we've got a tarp,

632
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,430
it will be less bad 
than the time before."

633
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,660
But it's hard,

634
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,390
because the rain never stops.

635
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,730
And last night

636
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,530
was one of the worst of my life.

637
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,400
So I don't see 
how it could get worse.

638
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,780
- That's not bad. 
- OK. It holds... Almost.

639
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,120
Well tight !

640
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,900
Oh ! What is this...?!

641
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,670
Oh, my God, Probst!

642
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,080
We were there, in the mud 
created by the storm,

643
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,930
and Jeff Probst shows up 
quietly on the camp.

644
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,960
And I don't know what's gonna happen

645
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,030
but I'm a little nervous.

646
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,000
Are these the traces of last night?

647
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,940
- Nobody slept. 
- We haven't slept at all.

648
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,020
The storm is getting worse.

649
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,400
We thought the tarp 
would help you support it.

650
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,650
But in the last few hours, 
she has been recategorized again.

651
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,320
It is now a cyclone.

652
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,000
And we predict that tonight 
it will be much worse

653
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,630
than last night.

654
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,890
What does it mean ?

655
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,970
So for the first time

656
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,470
in 33 seasons of Survivor,

657
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,280
we will evacuate you.

658
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,400
Oh my God !

659
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,350
Is that a bad thing?

660
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,990
It means it's serious.

661
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,350
It's serious !

662
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,020
My jaw dropped.

663
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,740
It is unprecedented!

664
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,640
This is unheard of !

665
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,880
There have been nasty storms 
in Survivor,

666
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,930
but that's never happened 
in 33 seasons of Survivor.

667
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,590
This is what will happen.

668
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,200
You will gather 
your personal belongings,

669
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,870
take your chickens, 
we're not going to leave them here.

670
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,540
You wanted adventure?

671
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,700
You have some !

672
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Good.

673
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,590
Where are you going?

674
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,000
We just arrived!

675
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,240
Everything will be completely destroyed.

676
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,300
It's no joke.

677
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,810
It's for real.

678
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,280
It's a real cyclone 
and real lives are at stake.

679
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,330
If the storm returns, we're finished.

680
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,250
It's wide open.

681
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,750
If it crosses, 
we will take it directly.

682
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,510
- Yeah, it's not good. 
- Look !

683
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,200
- Jeff! 
- What ?!

684
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,340
It's him !

685
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,830
- What's going on ? 
- [???] The tarpaulin.

686
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,020
Seeing Jeff,

687
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,660
I stopped breathing.

688
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,950
What's up, Jeff?

689
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,880
I knew 
something was wrong,

690
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,420
because Jeff very rarely comes 
to the camp,

691
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,330
unless 
it's a security issue.

692
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,490
Hi all !

693
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,310
- Thanks for the tarp. 
- Thanks.

694
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,540
Yes. That's why I'm here.

695
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,670
The tropical storm

696
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,610
I told you about yesterday

697
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,070
gains in intensity.

698
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,270
She was again recategorized.

699
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,140
It's a hurricane.

700
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,210
So,

701
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,110
we will get you off 
this beach,

702
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,420
take you to a safe place 
until it passes.

703
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,650
Can we take our bags 
before leaving?

704
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,320
Your personal affairs.

705
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,520
The rest...

706
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,060
We'll see what we have in the morning.

707
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Good !

708
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,800
Do we put the food and the gear 
in the shelter?

709
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,460
[???] bad idea.

710
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,910
Wow, the wind is coming.

711
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,240
A cyclone is going to hit today, 
and I'm not surprised, actually.

712
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,520
The weather is going to be terrible tonight.

713
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,810
We will therefore be evacuated.

714
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,190
Lord God!

715
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,480
Welcome, rain!

716
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,830
Oh my God !

717
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,110
Go up, go up!

718
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,320
Oh my God !

719
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,500
Oh shit.

720
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,800
- The biggest tree fell. 
- Yeah, he broke everything.

721
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,930
We would have... 
clearly been hurt.

722
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,910
On the 3rd day, we returned to the camp 
after the passage of the cyclone.

723
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,580
Everything was overturned

724
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,430
and a tree had fallen 
on our shelter.

725
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,960
We thought, 
"Lord, this is scary!"

726
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,500
We talk about our lives.

727
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,970
A falling tree 
could injure someone.

728
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,430
It was good that we were evacuated.

729
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,460
It was clearly a good thing 
that Jeff decided to do this.

730
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,970
We have work.

731
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,510
Alright, let's start clearing!

732
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,440
- Well received, let's get started! 
- Yeah, let's go!

733
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,630
The first few days in Survivor 
are all about building a shelter.

734
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,060
And I suck at it.

735
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,000
And we had to do it twice.

736
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,980
No one perceives me 
as physically strong.

737
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,200
- Dave, do you need help? 
- Its good !

738
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,230
So they have no reason 
to want to keep me.

739
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,720
So it all resonates with me,

740
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,010
this paranoia, 
this nervousness, this anxiety,

741
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,610
that I am in danger.

742
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,570
I've always been neurotic.

743
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,090
I've been afraid of dying 
since birth,

744
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,680
I think about it every day.

745
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,190
You mean, afraid of dying 
on a plane, of drowning...?

746
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,060
- Die in general. 
- In general.

747
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,980
I do not want to die. 
Because, you know...

748
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,390
So here you are really 
out of your element.

749
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,950
I came to broaden my horizons, 
it's the best way.

750
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,160
Want something new? 
Take this little guy!

751
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,910
Don't, don't!

752
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,540
It's just a stick insect, 
it's harmless.

753
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,380
- Are you sure ? 
- [???]

754
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,770
- Except walking around on you. 
- It doesn't sting?

755
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,550
- Are you sure ? 
- Yes.

756
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,940
There is little hope for me 
in this Survivor game.

757
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,350
But I'm a Gen X, 
I'm not giving up.

758
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,390
I will work hard 
to make it work.

759
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,740
I will reverse 
the situation for me.

760
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,990
I have 
to start researching the immunity idol thoroughly.

761
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,500
It may be the only thing 
that can save me.

762
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,770
Dave is looking for an idol.

763
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,620
Where ? On the beach ?

764
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,040
On the track there.

765
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,780
- He lost his mind. 
- I want to know what he's doing.

766
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,080
He was looking up there.

767
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,360
We need to calm him down, 
before it gets out of hand.

768
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,500
You must be really stupid.

769
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,560
Dave was madly looking for an idol

770
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,400
while we were building the shelter.

771
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,730
And that pissed off a lot of people.

772
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,360
If David has an idol,

773
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,740
That would probably complicate 
things later on.

774
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,950
So if we lose, it will be David.

775
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,760
I have an idea for the roof.

776
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,070
You can take 
bamboo strips

777
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,830
and tie them firmly.

778
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
OK.

779
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,700
We come back to camp 
and it's a mess.

780
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,160
We have the base of the shelter, 
but no roof.

781
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,010
So we had 
to tinker with the shelter.

782
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,270
And I led the construction 
of the second shelter.

783
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,550
It has to be 
at the height of the roof.

784
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,110
I don't know how to build a shelter. 
I live in Brooklyn!

785
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,350
Taking the metro is the limit 
of my outdoor skills.

786
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,410
Keep putting them through.

787
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,890
But you know what ? 
I took the plunge and did it.

788
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,710
And against all odds,

789
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,930
I became the boss.

790
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,990
I never see myself as the one 
who will adapt to the outside.

791
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,410
Go on, go on, go on!

792
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,340
You and it is, you and it is!

793
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,950
I'm not like that.

794
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,840
But the idea of ​​proving 
my toughness intrigues me.

795
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,550
You and it is, mec!

796
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,820
We are there, we are there!

797
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,320
So strangely,

798
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Survivor helps me 
reach my potential.

799
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,690
- Fire ! 
- Come on !

800
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,830
We have fire 
and I made it!

801
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,730
I never imagined

802
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,430
that I would be the one 
who would make a fire without flint!

803
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,570
We did it !

804
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,850
Yeah, my hen!

805
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,690
It is a moment in my life 
to mark with a white stone.

806
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,470
I am a new man.

807
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,640
The master of fire!

808
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,420
They say Survivor changes people, 
I feel changed already.

809
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,560
Dude, nothing will be the same!

810
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,580
I feel like I'm growing here.

811
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,380
I am affected by this experience,

812
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,120
in a very positive way.

813
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,090
I'm very proud of myself here.

814
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,250
- We are solid, do you think? 
- But yes.

815
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,900
I adore you both.

816
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,260
- I say. Me too. 
- We're a big threat.

817
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,730
I know I know.

818
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,320
- Honestly... 
- Yo, we're solid!

819
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,390
- The Triforce! 
- Damn, I love you!

820
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,280
- The Triforce! 
- Damn, I love you!

821
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,770
By observing the group,

822
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,710
I started to notice

823
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,360
that there really is 
a kind of division

824
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,250
between canon high school students

825
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,980
and weird nerds.

826
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,650
The cannons against the marginalized.

827
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,490
And it looks like the marginalized 
are going to be in the minority.

828
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,930
So, what do you think 
of the tribe so far?

829
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,730
Figgy and the boys are dangerous.

830
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,770
So I have to nip this in the bud.

831
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,940
I just want one person 
in this game to trust.

832
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,240
And I don't want the 
great-looking dorks to win.

833
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,260
You know what ? Remaining in the majority 
is important, at the beginning.

834
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,780
It can take two directions.

835
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:14,180
That of the handsome 
or that of the marginalized, us.

836
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,030
We can say so!

837
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,430
The group of cool hunks

838
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,530
isolates himself from the tribe.

839
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,830
So we have to break up this group.

840
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,390
I want to play with...

841
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,990
- Marginals. 
- Outcasts.

842
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,070
My goal is to play 
like I would play video games.

843
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,680
So at this point I gather

844
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,940
the marginalized, the excluded, 
in a way.

845
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,750
They isolate themselves at four.

846
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,220
So I started to insinuate

847
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,280
than the four foppish ones

848
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,750
were inseparable.

849
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,210
Figgy is very aggressive.

850
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,590
She holds the reins.

851
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,260
And that is dangerous.

852
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,830
So while we have the majority,

853
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,590
this is our opportunity to strike.

854
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,030
Over here, everyone!

855
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,020
Good.

856
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,030
First, I'm glad to see 
the two tribes bringing back their tarps.

857
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,300
Thanks a lot.

858
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,460
You can drop them off 
and leave them there.

859
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,480
Ready for your first 
immunity test?

860
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,060
This is what you covet 
in this game.

861
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,490
The immunity idol.

862
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,620
In possession of this, 
you are safe.

863
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,900
Without, you risk elimination.

864
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,480
Today 
you will make choices

865
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,680
who will help you either at the beginning 
or at the end of the event.

866
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,100
Here's how it works.

867
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,820
You will dash under an obstacle 
and retrieve a war club.

868
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,700
Then comes a rope tunnel.

869
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,940
You can cross in the state

870
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,940
or use a shortcut

871
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,080
which will make it much easier.

872
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,870
You will then reach a beam.

873
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,390
You can cross as is 
or use a shortcut

874
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,120
which will make it much easier.

875
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,560
You will then carry a crate 
to the finish

876
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,320
and solve a puzzle 
with the pieces it contains.

877
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,920
Here is the dilemma.

878
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,060
Every shortcut used

879
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,000
add ten pieces to the puzzle.

880
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,960
So if you think you're 
good at puzzles,

881
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,000
you might want 
to take the shortcut,

882
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,300
rush to the end 
and attack him as soon as possible.

883
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,630
If you are unsure about 
the puzzle,

884
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,010
you may have to cross 
the course as it is,

885
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,820
knowing that you will be behind,

886
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,320
but that you can reassemble 
with a smaller puzzle.

887
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,790
This test will be decided 
according to the group which, in a few days,

888
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,030
will have learned 
its strengths and weaknesses.

889
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,990
The first to finish 
win immunity,

890
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,040
are safe from the vote, and in addition...

891
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,440
Fire, in the form of flint.

892
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,160
The losers will go to the board

893
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,440
where someone will be 
the first person eliminated

894
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,690
of Survivor, 
Generation Y versus Generation X.

895
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,070
One minute to get organized 
and we'll get started.

896
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,320
Who will get the club?

897
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,630
- I will do it. 
- The big one ?

898
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,120
- I'll take care of the big one. 
- Are you sure ?

899
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,160
Who does the puzzle, at the end?

900
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,900
- Him and Rachel. 
- Unless someone is very good.

901
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,900
The beam may be...

902
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,190
We have to take the shortcut 
on the beam.

903
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,290
- Without even trying? 
- Yeah.

904
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,020
Well, on and go.

905
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,240
For immunity and fire.

906
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,710
Survivors, ready?

907
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,620
First step, detach

908
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,200
all your clubs.

909
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,990
Two on each side.

910
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,030
There's already a fight down there.

911
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,170
Jay and Chris face off!

912
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,640
You must untie all your clubs.

913
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,630
These 
and those along the pole.

914
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,240
Go to your mat, 
wait for the others!

915
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:37,450
Everyone must be there, 
with all your clubs.

916
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,780
- I'll hold his hands. 
- I'm holding his hands.

917
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,920
Chris blocks two Gen Ys, alone. 
They cannot reach their clubs.

918
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,620
You must all be gathered.

919
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,790
Do we have them all?

920
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,660
It's a fight! 
Chris is out.

921
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,050
Two Gen Ys are missing! 
Go ahead, Gen X!

922
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,230
On the eye!

923
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,470
On the eye!

924
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,620
Gen X 
will take the first shortcut.

925
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,510
Rachel takes a long time.

926
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,910
Its good ! Go for it !

927
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,670
Gen Ys 
don't take shortcuts.

928
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,680
From the outset, Gen X 
greatly simplifies the obstacle.

929
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,570
A wise choice, given their size.

930
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,420
They opened it.

931
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,900
Gen Ys are much finer.

932
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,450
They cross 
without taking the shortcut.

933
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,200
The Gen X are in the lead.

934
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,430
Here is Paul, the most imposing, 
finishing the obstacle!

935
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,930
Go ahead, Gen X!

936
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,340
Gen X will take 
the second shortcut.

937
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,470
Go for it !

938
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,880
Gen X 
took both shortcuts.

939
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:53,520
Go for it!

940
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,390
Forward, forward!

941
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:59,350
Gen Y are always 
on the first hurdle.

942
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:02,970
They may regret 
not taking the shortcut.

943
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,170
Huge advance for Gen X.

944
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,600
They arrive at the last post

945
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,030
where they will work 
on the most difficult puzzle.

946
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,080
Go ahead, Gen Y!

947
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,350
And There you go ! The Y Gens 
are going to take the second shortcut.

948
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,970
Ahead !

949
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,110
Gen X 
took both shortcuts.

950
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,400
They will work 
on a 70 piece puzzle.

951
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,780
Take a handful!

952
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,660
Here are Gen Y, 
who took advantage of a shortcut.

953
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,960
They will work 
on a 60 piece puzzle.

954
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,530
They have ten coins less.

955
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,300
Gen X have ten more.

956
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,740
Their puzzle 
is significantly more difficult.

957
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,480
They are far behind us, 
they have many more coins!

958
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,080
It's David and Rachel

959
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:49,870
and it's Michelle and Figgy.

960
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:53,780
Everything will depend on how quickly you 
solve this puzzle.

961
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,860
Gen Y 
are starting to pick up the pace.

962
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,320
They see their puzzle taking shape.

963
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,110
David and Rachel squandered 
the lead taken with the shortcuts.

964
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,160
If you see something, 
tell me!

965
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,070
We can't see, 
you want to exchange?

966
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,300
Yeah, go!

967
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,470
You go-y !

968
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,150
David and Rachel leave.

969
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,210
Jessica and Sunday replace them.

970
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,010
They try to make up for 
all the lost time.

971
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,330
More progress among Gen Y.

972
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,860
Ignore it, you progress.

973
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,850
Gen Xers 
are starting to make progress.

974
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,830
It starts to take shape.

975
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,090
It's good !

976
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,760
Only a few pieces 
left for Gen Y.

977
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,730
Gen X 
are desperately trying to come back up.

978
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:45,630
There are [???] on both sides.

979
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,790
Rachel offers a lot of help 
from the side.

980
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,110
She was there first 
and couldn't do anything.

981
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,400
Not nothing ! 
I did something !

982
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,950
This one goes sideways. 
This one there.

983
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,220
Gen Y are getting closer to the goal.

984
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,290
More than the one in the middle!

985
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,650
Gen Ys 
gain first immunity

986
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,080
and the reward!

987
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,790
Sending a signal to Gen X.

988
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,720
One, two, three, Gen Y!

989
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,370
Gen Y, congratulations!

990
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,900
The first immunity. 
Who wants it?

991
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,050
Congratulation.

992
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,660
No one will leave 
the Gen Y tribe.

993
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,790
Also, fire in the form of flint.

994
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,960
Not that we need it!

995
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,950
Take your things, 
return to camp.

996
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,090
Gen X. For one of you, 
that will be the end of the road.

997
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,840
Tonight, 
someone will be eliminated from this game.

998
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,810
The first person eliminated. 
Nobody wants to go through this.

999
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,510
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

1000
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,950
The test did not go 
as expected.

1001
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,410
It was a disaster.

1002
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,400
Rachel was barking orders.

1003
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,100
David, who claimed to be 
the king of the puzzle, screwed up.

1004
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,430
So these two are in danger.

1005
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,950
I wanted so much to beat Gen Y, 
and I really believed in it.

1006
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,920
We have a lot of 
strong and experienced people.

1007
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,500
I really thought

1008
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,460
that we would eclipse them today, 
and I'm shocked that we lost.

1009
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,950
Never do that again.

1010
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,130
I approve.

1011
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,110
They are fast. They are lively.

1012
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,200
But we had a strategy 
for the start of the event.

1013
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,010
We got fucked on the puzzle.

1014
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,610
In the immunity test,

1015
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,390
Rachel tells everyone 
she knows how to do puzzles,

1016
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,750
that's his thing. 
And she fucks us all.

1017
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,830
I'm going to fetch water. 
Anyone want some?

1018
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,380
Let's go.

1019
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,200
You want to come ? Great.

1020
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,120
- Are you going in the water? 
- Yeah, we have to go wash up.

1021
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,140
We have to wash up.

1022
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,600
We have to win races.

1023
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,940
Physically, 
we were there.

1024
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,020
You two, sorry, 
but you should have done the puzzle,

1025
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,450
because you would have succeeded 
with a little more time.

1026
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,520
If you say, "I'm doing the puzzle!", 
and then you fail,

1027
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,190
then you disqualify yourself.

1028
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,900
If a person does not insure 
in an event,

1029
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,050
it will always 
shine the spotlight on her.

1030
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,820
That's how things go here.

1031
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,590
I think we're good with her.

1032
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,800
So for now, 
we're going to vote for Rachel.

1033
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,570
But my fear is of course 
that someone has an idol.

1034
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,070
- We're in agreement, huh? 
- Absolutely.

1035
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,790
Everyone is strategizing 
without including me.

1036
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,360
I don't think anyone 
trusts me at this point.

1037
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,810
I know my position in the game.

1038
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,580
My head is on the block. 
I'm thinking of leaving tonight.

1039
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,620
Hey, I'd like to talk to you

1040
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,120
when you have a moment.

1041
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,530
- I don't want to leave tonight. 
- Yeah.

1042
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,700
I'm ready to write 
whatever name you like.

1043
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,820
Good.

1044
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,150
I want certainty 
that you don't have an idol.

1045
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,040
100% I don't.

1046
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,000
And believe me, I would love to, 
I would play it tonight.

1047
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,430
- But no. 
- We would have made an agreement, otherwise.

1048
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,640
I don't have one, 
so what, okay?

1049
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,180
You seem to think I have one. 
But no, really not.

1050
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,780
Well, I know rumor 
has it you have one.

1051
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,620
I tell you everything, I explain to you.

1052
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,010
That's exactly 
what went through my head.

1053
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,580
I got a little paranoid

1054
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,210
I had the impression

1055
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:55,760
not to be included 
in the strategies and everything.

1056
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,650
So what I did... 
Yes, I came here,

1057
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,550
I searched the area, 
hoping to find something.

1058
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,000
Of course, you can 
write my name, it's your choice.

1059
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,340
I hope not.

1060
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,670
If you don't, 
you'll have my loyalty.

1061
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,870
I think David has an idol 
despite his denials.

1062
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,110
And that makes me very nervous.

1063
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,910
So I want him to be comfortable.

1064
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,150
Don't be paranoid and you'll be fine.

1065
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,240
- I appreciate. 
- Yes, it will be fine.

1066
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,120
My decision is, Rachel or David.

1067
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,440
It's interesting, 
they talk to everyone except me.

1068
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,420
Rachel is useless in trial.

1069
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,160
For me, it's a handicap.

1070
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:34,400
And I might vote David tonight, 
because I believe he has an idol.

1071
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,760
Its good ? Its good.

1072
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,000
I appreciate.

1073
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,050
But if I have six people, 
that's enough to split the votes.

1074
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,510
And I think we got me, Chris,

1075
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,480
So, Cece, Ken, Rachel and Dave

1076
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,070
will be excluded from the decision.

1077
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,950
- It's Rachel or him. 
- Yes, Rachel or him.

1078
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,230
Let's divide the votes.

1079
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,290
Pass the word to Sunday and then...

1080
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,870
- Who do you think they are thinking about? 
- I do not know.

1081
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,090
I wonder if people think 
I've given up on the puzzle.

1082
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,420
- We sit together tonight, okay? 
- Yeah, sure.

1083
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,340
Something weird is going on, isn't it?

1084
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,570
- Do you see alliances forming? 
- Yes.

1085
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,870
Say no more words.

1086
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,400
I do not know.

1087
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,530
I don't really know 
what's going on.

1088
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,800
I never imagined 
feeling this so early in the game.

1089
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,250
I believe Cece and I 
are in danger.

1090
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,740
What do you think ?

1091
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,230
I do not know,

1092
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,570
I haven't had time 
to think about it.

1093
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,070
- I do not believe it. 
- Believe it!

1094
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,990
It's not a good sign 
when people tell you, "I don't know."

1095
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,300
So I'm not too sure 
where I stand.

1096
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,470
- Relax, man! 
- I appreciate.

1097
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,940
I am at the mercy of my comrades.

1098
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:50,810
I'm my own worst enemy 
in the game, I've been paranoid.

1099
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,210
I hope that the speech 
that I made to them

1100
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,540
will be enough

1101
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,050
to reassure 
them and save me.

1102
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,570
I'm afraid not.

1103
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,840
I'm almost sure not.

1104
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,280
But I won't know until the council.

1105
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,170
Behind you, torches.

1106
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,300
Take one,

1107
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,810
approach the fire, 
immerse it and light it.

1108
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,910
It is part 
of the council ritual,

1109
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,190
because in this game,

1110
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,820
fire represents your life.

1111
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,080
If he disappears

1112
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,260
you too.

1113
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,090
Alas, 
one of you will be tonight.

1114
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,260
But let's start at the beginning,

1115
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,340
because those first days 
were among the hardest

1116
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,350
never experienced by Survivors.

1117
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,870
Jessica, even looking at your eyes! 
What's going on ?

1118
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,040
When we had to be evacuated 
because of the cyclone,

1119
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,410
the winds 
were deliriously strong,

1120
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,270
raising a lot of sand.

1121
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,190
I took sand in the right eye.

1122
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,150
I now have 
a bacterial infection in my eye,

1123
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,660
which went into the other eye.

1124
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,330
Bret, even when I approached 
the beach,

1125
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,550
the sand was bombarding me violently, 
and the storm was not yet here.

1126
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,170
I thought it was comparable 
to a northeast storm in Boston,

1127
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,490
but I think 
it was ten times worse.

1128
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,840
It was intense.

1129
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,340
It felt 
like it would never end.

1130
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,800
- David. 
- Oh, shit!

1131
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,180
- Sorry ? 
- I said, "Oh, shit!"

1132
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,510
Why, "Oh, shit!" ?

1133
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,540
Because he is afraid of everything!

1134
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,070
He is afraid of everything.

1135
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,510
Wow, David, 
all nine say it in unison!

1136
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,690
This is the first time I have camped 
in 21 years.

1137
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,360
The world where I feel 
safe has shrunk.

1138
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,290
But here, in nature,

1139
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,990
I am stripped of everything 
and I am transparent.

1140
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,630
It's as if these four days

1141
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,310
had lasted a year.

1142
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,080
I am very happy 
with this experience.

1143
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,750
These are the words of someone 
who wouldn't mind leaving.

1144
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:09,910
"I am very happy 
with this experience."

1145
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,940
I don't want to leave tonight.

1146
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,220
But I risk leaving.

1147
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,150
My worst enemy in the game, 
honestly, is myself.

1148
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,060
That's what 
I'm up against here.

1149
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,090
Cece, do you sympathize 
with David's pain?

1150
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,690
No one wants to be eliminated,

1151
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:28,070
but above all, 
no one wants to be the first.

1152
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,230
Of course, I sympathize.

1153
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,410
You dreamed of being in Survivor 
and you risk leaving...

1154
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,100
I wouldn't wish that on anyone. 
It's horrible.

1155
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,560
Sunday, is it great 
to hear someone say,

1156
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,000
"It could be me." ?

1157
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,550
Absolutely, because, 
you know, I love David,

1158
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,330
but we all want to stay.

1159
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,280
And if someone gets attention, 
it turns it away from you

1160
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,130
and you may 
be less likely to leave.

1161
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,380
Among you ten,

1162
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:57,900
who, in the last few days, 
thought, "That could be me." ?

1163
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,730
All of us !

1164
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,660
Chris, is this 
a real impression

1165
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,660
or just this paranoia,

1166
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,190
"Who knows 
if they are frank with me?"

1167
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,260
Probably just paranoia.

1168
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,510
On the second day, I thought I was isolated. 
I actually thought,

1169
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:16,040
"My God, I'm going out on the first 
and it's going to be hell when I get home.

1170
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:19,050
But I thought, 
"It's probably in my head.

1171
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,650
I'm going to show them 
that I can work hard."

1172
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,480
And I feel much better today.

1173
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,690
Rachel, how about you?

1174
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:28,050
Tell me about the time you 
thought, "Maybe I'm in trouble."

1175
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,860
Today, in fact, 
when everyone seemed undecided,

1176
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,870
without reaction and approached.

1177
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,280
These were very unusual behaviors .

1178
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,230
So I don't feel comfortable.

1179
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,940
Either it's paranoia 
or I'll walk away.

1180
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,680
Why would it be you?

1181
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,670
I do not know. 
I may have been very frank.

1182
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,770
I say what I think 
as I think.

1183
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,480
It's not out of malice

1184
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,380
or to intentionally injure.

1185
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,800
I don't hurt 
feelings on purpose.

1186
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,520
Whether they vote for me or not, 
I want to do my mea culpa.

1187
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:04,810
I apologize to everyone 
if I have offended you.

1188
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,270
Good. Let's talk about idols.

1189
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,860
Jessica, what do you think?

1190
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,000
Are there any idols in play? 
Could anyone here have some?

1191
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,140
There are clearly idols 
in this game.

1192
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:19,400
And some 
have had opportunities to look for it.

1193
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,370
It must have played a part 
in David's paranoia,

1194
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,850
because that is one of the concerns 
that have arisen about him.

1195
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,640
And we come back to David!

1196
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,290
Yeah, isn't that great?

1197
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:33,590
You know, 
I respect that answer.

1198
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,760
I want to prove tonight

1199
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,390
that you can trust me.

1200
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,400
So it's a test.

1201
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,960
Good. It's time to vote.

1202
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,310
Paul, over to you.

1203
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:29,410
I will count the votes.

1204
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,850
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

1205
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,880
now is the time to do it.

1206
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,470
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

1207
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:51,990
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

1208
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,600
I will read the votes.

1209
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,380
What what. A Cece vote,

1210
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,780
one David vote, one Rachel vote.

1211
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,600
Rachel. 
That's two votes Rachel.

1212
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,660
Cece. 
That's two Cece votes.

1213
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,870
Cece. 
Equality. Three votes Cece,

1214
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,370
three votes Rachel,

1215
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,170
a David vote.

1216
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,180
Rachel. 
Four votes Rachel,

1217
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,650
three votes Cece,

1218
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,320
one vote remains.

1219
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,330
First person eliminated 
from Survivor, Gen Y against Gen X...

1220
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,010
Rachel. 
Bring me your torch.

1221
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,650
Rachel, the tribe has spoken.

1222
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,210
It's time to go.

1223
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:25,160
One of the distinctive traits 
of Generation X,

1224
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,920
hard work doesn't scare you.

1225
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:29,500
And you've clearly been 
working hard these past few days.

1226
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,470
The big question is,

1227
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,900
how are you going to recover 
from these Gen Y?

1228
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:35,470
Good news,

1229
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,780
fire, in the form of flint, 
will be waiting for you at camp.

1230
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:40,450
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

1231
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,190
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

1232
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,470
Next time in Survivor...

1233
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:02,860
There is romance in the air.

1234
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,540
I have Chimene's eyes.

1235
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,370
Man, couples don't last.

1236
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,180
Sometimes women blind you. 
Wake up !

1237
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:12,290
And someone's stay 
could be cut short.

1238
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,500
Breathe, my friend.

1239
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,040
He may have had 
a heart attack.

1240
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,950
It could be positive for me.

1241
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,450
Survivor is...

1242
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:24,040
one of the toughest and most brutal 
social games on the planet.

1243
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,420
But I'm happy 
to have had this experience.

1244
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,540
I hope to use it 
to improve myself.

1245
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,480
Surviving the elements 
is much harder

1246
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,640
as you might think on TV.

1247
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,810
But for the most part, 
I had a lot of fun.
