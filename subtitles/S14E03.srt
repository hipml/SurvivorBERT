00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,087
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,337
>> Water!

4
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,214
>> Just lick some leaves, man.

5
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,132
>>PROBST: Life at Ravu was

6
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,216
bleak.

7
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:08,675
>> I never experienced

8
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,968
dehydration like this.

9
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,136
Half of us can't even stand up.

10
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,137
It's crazy!

11
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,305
We're starving here, bro.

12
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,184
>> Life at Moto was carefree.

13
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,060
>> We have a really plush couch.

14
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,688
We are very fortunate to be

15
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,605
living the way that we're

16
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,356
living.

17
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,190
>> Boo, be careful!

18
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,318
>> PROBST: And Boo got careless.

19
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,945
>> Boo is a real hazard to

20
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,155
hisself, and he will hurt

21
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,324
hisself out of the game.

22
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,743
>> Sylvia.

23
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,618
>> Is she here?

24
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,369
>> PROBST: Sylvia joined Ravu

25
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,246
after a night on Exile Island.

26
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,456
>> Welcome home!

27
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,915
When I went up to greet her, I

28
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:41,458
was actually quite nasty.

29
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,376
I look over her shoulder, and

30
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,836
I open up her shoulder bag to

31
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,462
see if she found the immunity

32
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,422
idol.

33
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,173
>> Tonight, we ought to go out

34
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,924
and get some oysters.

35
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,467
>> PROBST: But her presence

36
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,259
brought on new frustrations.

37
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,303
>> I was not really excited for

38
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,095
Sylvia to come back.

39
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,930
I personally think she's a

40
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,932
little bossy.

41
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:58,892
>> PROBST: At the immunity

42
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,684
challenge...

43
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,935
>> I'm pulling out the...

44
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:01,895
>> PROBST: Erica's certain she's

45
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,062
right!

46
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,689
Erica spoke up, while Moto

47
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,982
pulled ahead.

48
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,902
Moto wins the challenge!

49
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,195
Moto.

50
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,697
Moto took home fishing supplies,

51
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,033
and banished Earl, who battled

52
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,578
the serpents on Exile Island.

53
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,957
Facing Tribal Council...

54
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,666
>> PROBST: ...Mooky and Rocky

55
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,126
turned against Erica...

56
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:25,668
>> Now you want Erica, huh?

57
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,128
She freaked out.

58
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:27,712
>> PROBST: ...blaming her for

59
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,297
Ravu's loss.

60
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,381
>> She was screaming, she's on

61
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,758
people about peace and this

62
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,592
and that, when it wasn't even

63
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,844
her place to be there.

64
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,470
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council...

65
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,137
>> Sylvia is used to dictating

66
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,348
and telling people what to do.

67
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:38,807
>> PROBST: ...Sylvia's

68
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,433
personality was scrutinized.

69
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,392
>> You have a habit of

70
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,936
kind of throwing out an idea and

71
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,020
saying, "Let's do it," and not

72
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,522
actually talking with anybody.

73
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,064
>> PROBST: But it was Erica

74
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,357
whose torch was snuffed.

75
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,276
Erica, the tribe has spoken.

76
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,904
17 are left.

77
00:01:52,987 --> 00:02:10,296
Who will be voted out tonight?

78
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,090
>> The two back-to-back losses

79
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,299
have really affected us, and

80
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,176
this last Tribal Council was

81
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,220
very brutal.

82
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,305
We came to a realization that

83
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,850
we are quite... not quite

84
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,392
connected together yet as a

85
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,310
tribe.

86
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:24,894
>> First thing in the morning,

87
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,478
let's cut some coconuts, get

88
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,647
some... get hydrated, cut some

89
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,107
pineapples.

90
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,942
>> I would like to, if I see

91
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,111
big sun, if I could try and

92
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,571
start a fire.

93
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,363
>> Yeah, I'll be out there on

94
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:35,947
the beach with you, too, with

95
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,281
some glasses.

96
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,282
>> Being the biggest group of

97
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,325
losers that<i> Survivor</i> has ever

98
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,869
seen sucks!

99
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,911
It's no fun.

100
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,912
We can't win challenges right

101
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,496
now; I don't know what it is.

102
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,123
I don't know if they put,

103
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:45,748
like, a jinx on us or a curse,

104
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,834
but we just can't win right now.

105
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,127
Let's say we do have a challenge

106
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,545
tomorrow, okay?

107
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,297
I'm not telling you what to do.

108
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,298
I'm just throwing out a

109
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,299
suggestion.

110
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,341
Maybe... maybe, like, somebody

111
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,260
could just-- not even take

112
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,261
charge-- just one person can

113
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:58,595
talk at a time.

114
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,138
When everybody talks over each

115
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:00,889
other, it doesn't work.

116
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,891
>> Right.

117
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:03,975
>> At this point, we still have

118
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,143
the desire to win, but we

119
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,769
really need to get our act

120
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,979
together and have a good

121
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,438
strategy going in.

122
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,690
>> Let's put egos aside and put

123
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,942
tribe and winning first, and

124
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,444
just, you know, have...

125
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,029
We've got to try.

126
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,156
>> The more we lose, the more

127
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,033
difficult it is to recover.

128
00:03:27,332 --> 00:04:43,491
(theme song playing)

129
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,535
>> This is going to dry real

130
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,452
quick.

131
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,620
>> Looks nice, huh?

132
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,621
>> It's pretty.

133
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,580
>> I like it.

134
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,456
>> Lisi suggested that we paint

135
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,000
the floor to kind of seal up the

136
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,042
wood to prevent the ants from

137
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,419
coming in.

138
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,378
It will look nice, but there's

139
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,338
a function to it.

140
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:57,880
>> It looks pretty, but it

141
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,298
wasn't done with the intention

142
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,341
for aesthetics.

143
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,384
I'll bet the ant lines are going

144
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,804
to be a lot less tonight.

145
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,056
>> Hurry, hurry, to the pot.

146
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,390
>> Very good.

147
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,475
>> Oh, they're perfect.

148
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,476
>> This is going too great.

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,519
>> Yeah. It's, like, too good to

150
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,729
be true, man.

151
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,771
>> We gotta take a poll.

152
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,480
>> Are we really on<i> Survivor,</i>

153
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,400
or are we dreaming?

154
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,359
>> We're just having a party

155
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,486
out here, really.

156
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,071
We're telling jokes, lounging

157
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,364
around on a hammock.

158
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,449
We don't have to win anything

159
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,160
else as far as survival.

160
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,453
It's not even survival.

161
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,455
It's "thrive-al."

162
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,706
>> I really wouldn't be

163
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,915
surprised if the people on the

164
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,833
other side just started dropping

165
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,876
like flies because they

166
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,501
just don't seem to be catching a

167
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,503
break, man.

168
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,191
>> Big Earl!

169
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,069
>> Ravu!

170
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,570
>> Welcome home!

171
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,238
>> You guys got a fire?

172
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,073
>> No.

173
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,157
The sun, we seen it today, man.

174
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,699
>> But you got some water,

175
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,367
sweetie?

176
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,161
>> I'm back from Exile Island.

177
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,204
The first thing they asked me,

178
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,371
"Do you have water?"

179
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,790
It was like walking on the

180
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,582
beach to a bunch of begging

181
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,793
children.

182
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,460
>> Was the clue really obscure?

183
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,547
>> The clue is interesting.

184
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,591
As far as the immunity idol, I

185
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,095
sure have no idea where it is.

186
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,596
I mean, I don't know how it

187
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,098
really works, with the clue

188
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:30,681
thing, like, I mean, you guys

189
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,433
probably know more than I do.

190
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:32,975
I mean, I have to give more

191
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,643
thought, and really survey the

192
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,603
land.

193
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,105
It's under something that's

194
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,815
high, and it can be anywhere,

195
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,025
but I'll figure something out.

196
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,320
Losing-- it hurts.

197
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,571
Yeah, I mean, come on.

198
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,949
It's, like, no fire again?

199
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,367
We're trying to take advantage

200
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,743
of any of this sun or are we

201
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,036
just, like, dead?

202
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,703
>> Now we're waiting for the

203
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,746
point where it gets up high

204
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,623
enough.

205
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,501
>> Dear Sun, Michelle would

206
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,710
like you to come out and play

207
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,254
today.

208
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,464
Please participate in my game.

209
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,841
Sincerely, Michelle.

210
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,800
>> It's coming out.

211
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,759
It's going to come out.

212
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,011
>> Yeah.

213
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,139
We haven't had fire, so I

214
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,432
decided to just go out and give

215
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,436
it a go while we have some sun.

216
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,647
The sun's moving fast, oh, geez.

217
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,192
Using glasses to start a fire

218
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,195
is absolutely possible.

219
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,989
I started to pray, because I

220
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:28,573
know my momma doesn't want me

221
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:33,327
to die out here.

222
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,412
Come on.

223
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:40,918
Burn, baby, burn.

224
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,503
Whoo!

225
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,838
I looked down about a minute

226
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,714
and a half later, and I see the

227
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,259
start of a fire, so I go running

228
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,385
back to the beach.

229
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:49,969
First person I see is Anthony,

230
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,596
and I hand that off to him.

231
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,514
I'm, like, "Start a fire with

232
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:53,723
this."

233
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,515
>> Fire!

234
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,017
>> Fire?

235
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,434
>> Help.

236
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,143
>> Oh, here, here, here, here.

237
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:57,685
>> I got to go.

238
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,686
Where am I going?

239
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,353
>> Oh, my God.

240
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,147
>> There you go.

241
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,273
>> Give me some tinders.

242
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:02,899
>> Somebody blow, somebody blow.

243
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,649
Gentle, gentle.

244
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,735
Anything you got here, get it

245
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,613
going, come on.

246
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,909
(cheering)

247
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,497
>> Awesome.

248
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,708
(cheering, whooping)

249
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,711
>> We're not gonna die.

250
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,754
>> We've been struggling a long

251
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,130
time, and now we finally got a

252
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,215
shot in the ass that we needed,

253
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,507
so I think it's going to be a

254
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,508
good day.

255
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,092
I'd be scared to be the other

256
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,802
team right now because we're,

257
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,179
we're just so fired up, it's

258
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,391
ridiculous.

259
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,353
>> PROBST: Moto, come on in.

260
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,733
Ravu, come on in.

261
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,860
Moto, getting your first look at

262
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,071
the new Ravu tribe.

263
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:50,655
Erica voted out at the last

264
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,991
Tribal Council.

265
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,997
Ravu, last time I talked to you

266
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,541
guys, life was not enjoyable.

267
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,918
Rocky, things still tough over

268
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:04,919
there?

269
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,128
>> Uh, things are tough, but,

270
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,129
but they're getting better.

271
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:07,755
My, uh, my girl Michelle over

272
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,466
here started a fire today...

273
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,717
boiled some water; things are

274
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,718
looking up.

275
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,970
>> PROBST: You started fire?

276
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,971
>> Yes.

277
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,680
>> Michelle did, yes, we did.

278
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,305
>> Yes.

279
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,223
>> PROBST: Ravu, I got to say

280
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,850
you have done what very few

281
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,477
tribes have ever done in this

282
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,937
game, which is start fire on

283
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,938
your own.

284
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:24,730
Congratulations.

285
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,815
Because you have fire, you no

286
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,857
longer have to earn it.

287
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,733
Here's your flint.

288
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,443
(cheering)

289
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,237
You now have your flint, same as

290
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,238
Moto.

291
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,239
Hopefully, you'll be able to

292
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,199
keep your fire going.

293
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,659
All right, for today's reward

294
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,868
challenge, you will race head-

295
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,371
to-head as you slide down a

296
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,665
slippery course to retrieve a

297
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,500
numbered ball that I will

298
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,919
randomly assign each round.

299
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,671
First tribe member to toss your

300
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,715
ball into a basket scores a

301
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,841
point for their tribe.

302
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,800
First tribe to six wins reward.

303
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,885
Want to know what you're playing

304
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:55,886
for?

305
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,721
>> ALL: Yeah!

306
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,263
>> PROBST: You will have a

307
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,556
choice.

308
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,516
First reward you might choose is

309
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,892
a little taste of home in the

310
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,687
form of your luxury items.

311
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,688
>> Wow.

312
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,188
>> PROBST: If that's not

313
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,608
whetting your appetite...

314
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,320
(gasping, murmuring)

315
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,405
...an exact duplicate set of the

316
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,865
fishing gear that Moto won.

317
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,158
If you don't like either of

318
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,660
those, third choice: instant

319
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,830
gratification-- fresh fruit.

320
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,332
In addition, the winning tribe

321
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,916
will send one member from the

322
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,003
losing tribe to Exile Island.

323
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:29,712
This time, however, that person

324
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,506
will not be immune.

325
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,300
They will rejoin their tribe

326
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,301
before the next challenge.

327
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,302
Moto, because you have one extra

328
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,303
member, you're sitting somebody

329
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,304
out.

330
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,180
>> I want to sit out.

331
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,056

Lisi, you'll take a spot on the

334
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,391
bench; everybody else,

335
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,809
we'll get started.

336
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,066
>> PROBST: For the first round,

337
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,733
it will be Anthony for Ravu;

338
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,737
Gary, Papa Smurf, for Moto.

339
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,531
You are going for number nine.

Survivors ready?

341
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,660
Go!

342
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,745

344
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,998
>> PROBST: Gary trying to run,

345
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,958

Anthony sliding his way across.

347
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,089
Gary and Anthony both tiptoeing.

348
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,132
Oh! Gary takes another one,

349
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:15,800
hard.

350
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,801

351
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,095

Gary scores for Moto!

358
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,108
Moto leads, one-zero.

359
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,610
Next round will be two women.

360
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,861
For Ravu, it is Rita taking on

361
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,946
Cassandra.

362
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,490
For Moto, going for number

363
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,866
three.

364
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,201

365
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:42,368

Oh! Cassandra takes a hard fall

371
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,835
and turns it into a great slide!

372
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,338
Cassandra has her ball.

373
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:54,922
She knocks off Rita's.

374
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,967
Cassandra's trying to stay up.

375
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,010

380
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,312
Choice of rewards on the line.

391
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,379
Paddling right to number seven,

392
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,005
grabs it on his way and heads

393
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,090
to the basket.

394
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,925

(teams shouting)

405
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,994
Stacy really working that slide,

406
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:07,828
every bit of it.

407
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,498
She's got her ball and drops it

408
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,457
and falls.

409
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,126
Michelle has hers and drops it.

410
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,254
They're both gingerly tiptoeing.

411
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,839
To the shooting line.

412
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,090
Michelle tosses.

413
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,469
She's short.

414
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,722

415
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,976

Go!

425
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,412

426
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,540
Mookie launches himself.

427
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,293
Alex surfing across the course.

428
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,254
Mookie has his ball.

429
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,005
Alex has his and drops it and

430
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,048
falls.

431
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,259
Mookie gets off a shot, but it's

432
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,804
missed.

Go!

441
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,992
>> Come on, Liliana!

442
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,909
>> PROBST: Oh!

443
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,120
Sylvia takes a hard fall.

444
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,205
Liliana right on target.

445
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,582
She's got her ball, and she's

446
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,417
heading to the shooting line.

447
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,918
Sylvia struggling to get to her

448
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,295
ball.

A big lead for Liliana.

450
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,425
Sylvia walking very gingerly,

451
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,260
tiptoeing her way across this

452
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,177
course.

453
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,054
Giving Liliana a lot of free

454
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,598
shots.

455
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,140
Sylvia still not at the

456
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,019
shooting line.

457
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,979
Liliana scores for Moto!

458
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,065

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,988
Going for number 11.

462
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,656
Survivors ready?

463
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,199
Go!

464
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,160
Edgardo out of the gate quickly.

465
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,580
Earl catches up quickly.

466
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,875
Both guys now on their feet.

467
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,127
Edgardo's got his ball.

468
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,754
Earl has his.

469
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,422
Edgardo launches his first shot

470
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,715
and misses.

471
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,550
Earl taking his time...

472
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,304
and just misses for Ravu.

473
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,681
Edgardo scores for Moto!

474
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,644

Next round, Yau-Man for Ravu

476
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,981
against Dre for Moto.

477
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,192
>> (laughs loudly)

478
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,235
>> PROBST: Moto leads, five-two.

479
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,195
It takes six to win.

480
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,697
Dre could win it right here for

481
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,698
Moto.

482
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,324
Yau-Man trying to keep Ravu in

483
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,950
it.

484
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,203
You are going for number five.

485
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,039
Survivors ready?

486
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,917
Go!

487
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,421
(teams shouting)

488
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,049
Yau-Man right in this with Dre.

489
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,634
Dre has his ball.

490
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,010
Yau-Man has his.

491
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,011
Yau-Man looking very light on

492
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:16,475
his feet.

493
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,810
Dre misses short.

494
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,603
Yau-Man with a nice toss, just

495
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,104
misses.

496
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,230
>> Come on, Dre!

497
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,023
>> PROBST: Oh!

498
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,567
Dre's is in and out for Moto.

499
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,151
Yau-Man needs to score to keep

500
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,696
Ravu in it.

501
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,905
Very close.

502
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,073
Moto could win it with this

503
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,241
shot.

504
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,659
Just short.

505
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,077
Yau-Man launches for Ravu.

506
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,704
>> Oh!

507
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,997
>> PROBST: Close again.

508
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,207
Dre rims it.

509
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,254
Ravu can stay alive.

510
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,966
Yau-Man just misses.

511
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,217
Dre scores for Moto!

512
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,470
Moto wins reward!

513
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,018
Moto, congratulations.

514
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,520
You continue to dominate,

515
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,271
undefeated in challenges thus

516
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,148
far.

517
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,858
Which of the three rewards are

518
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,067
you going to take?

519
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,193
>> The fishing gear.

520
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,111
>> PROBST: Fishing gear.

521
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,571
Which tribe member of Ravu's

522
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,072
are you going to send to Exile

523
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:12,281
Island?

524
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,657
>> Sylvia.

525
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,366
>> PROBST: Sylvia.

526
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,325
>> I was afraid of that.

527
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,410
>> PROBST: Sylvia, grab your

528
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,244
bag.

529
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,538
Boat's waiting.

530
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,998
>> Bye, sweetie.

531
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:21,707
>> Good luck. Sorry.

532
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,083
>> PROBST: Moto, more riches.

533
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,877
Come get your reward, head back

534
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,379
to camp.

535
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,481
>> Today at challenge, I didn't

536
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,357
do very well, and I'm very

537
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,359
embarrassed by it.

538
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,819
This is the second time I've

539
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,987
been separated from my tribe in

540
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,655
only seven days, and they're

541
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,198
probably sitting around and

542
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,408
saying, "We should've let Sylvia

543
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,910
go sooner 'cause she's a real

544
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:02,414
albatross around our neck."

545
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,041
Clue number three: "When night

546
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,334
has fallen and the tribe is

547
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,503
asleep, you'll find it under the

548
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,421
cave's threshold if you dig

549
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,298
deep."

550
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,925
Interesting.

551
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,219
The third clue is so helpful.

552
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,762
It said, dig right under the

553
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,096
tallest part of the arch of the

554
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,223
cave, and the immunity idol

555
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,226
will be there.

556
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,269
I'm in a... probably the most

557
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,270
tenuous position right now with

558
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,106
my tribe.

559
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,234
The idol is right smack-dab in

560
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,194
the middle of camp, so I need to

561
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,112
figure out a time and a place to

562
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,572
look for the idol as quickly as

563
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,743
possible.

564
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,911
>> SEVERAL (chanting): Moto!

565
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,496
Moto! Moto!

566
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,164
(whooping)

567
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,041
>> Oh, man, we are eating good.

568
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,209
>> Oh, yeah, baby!

569
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,210
>> We take no prisoners, not

570
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,212
even women and the children.

571
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,505
>> I loved that challenge,

572
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,507
seeing people slip and fall.

573
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,259
>> I am so happy we got this.

574
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,802
>> And as long as we keep the

575
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,178
lead, our morale stays up,

576
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,556
their morale goes down-- bam,

577
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,849
there it is right there, that

578
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,349
whole game, every time.

579
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,350
So funny when Papa Smurf

580
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,060
fell down.

581
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,354
(laughter)

582
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:07,938
>> That<i> was</i> funny.

583
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,356
>> When he fell down, I was,

584
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,315
like, "Golly!"

585
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,775
>> Who?

586
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:27,207
>> Papa Smurf.

587
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,292
>> I've busted ribs before, and

588
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,377
it feels like I... just like

589
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,545
when I broke that one, can't get

590
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,504
a deep breath.

591
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,840
Just... had some dizziness, uh,

592
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,675
before, where I kind of just...

593
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,719
and it feels like it's the same

594
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,761
thing.

595
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,345
>> We were all sitting around,

596
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,723
and all of a sudden, you know,

597
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,682
we noticed Gary wasn't doing

598
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,391
too well.

599
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,143
He took a pretty hard fall in

600
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,603
the challenge, so, you know, we

601
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,105
were just concerned.

602
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,773
So we got the medics to come out

603
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,526
here and take a look at him.

604
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:18,383
>> Is it hard for you to talk?

605
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,594
>> No, no.

606
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,107
>> Yeah... okay.

607
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,151
>> And that's... I don't know...

608
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,824
>> He was afraid.

609
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,909
He said he didn't want to die

610
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,994
in Fiji.

611
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,246
And that he was real afraid.

612
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,498
He couldn't-- he didn't know

613
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,500
where he was.

614
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,751
I know this is a passion for

615
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,086
him.

616
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,420
A lot of people look at it as a

617
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,590
game, but he's older.

618
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:04,930
And I just want him to be okay.

619
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,099
>> Yeah.

620
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,044
>> See if that helps you.

621
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,336
>> Okay.

622
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,462
>> Will that be all right?

623
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,172
>> Yes.

624
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:39,923
>> All righty?

625
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,967
>> Yes.

626
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,551
>> The plan for now is to have

627
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,013
Gary just rest for a while, see

628
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:46,638
how he wakes up in the morning.

629
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,514
>> Thank you.

630
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,433
>> Take care.

631
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,685
>> But my thinking is if he

632
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,062
cannot breathe, you know,

633
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:54,730
it's...

634
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,856
It's best for him to just go

635
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,692
and get that taken care of.

636
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,282
>> Yeah.

637
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,074
>> Gary's a great guy.

638
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,159
I mean, we all kind of look up

639
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,243
to the guy, and, you know, he's

640
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,244
in our prayers, and we just

641
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,705
hope he gets better.

642
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,341
>> Tree mail!

643
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,634
Come and get it!

644
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,552
>> We've got mail?

645
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,386
>> Yep.

646
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,637
>> "Keeping your tribe together

647
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,681
won't require brawn.

648
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,308
This one is a true test of

649
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,559
will, and now it's time to get

650
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,227
it on."

651
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,145
>> A physical one.

652
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,313
>> No, it won't require brawn.

653
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,189
It's endurance.

654
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:37,773
>> Today, we're getting ready

655
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,524
for another challenge.

656
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,860
Don't know what it entails.

657
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,444
It's kind of hard to speculate

658
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,780
because, in this game, when you

659
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,031
think it's going one way, all

660
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:52,579
of a sudden, it goes the other.

661
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,539
>> Gary showing up to the next

662
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,749
challenge in this sort of

663
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,125
weakened position is going to

664
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,210
hurt our tribe, so if it's

665
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,586
going to be the case that he's

666
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,712
just not going to be able to

667
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,421
perform, then it's in his best

668
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,548
interest, as well as ours, to

669
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,759
just-- he should just call it

670
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,844
quits.

671
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,012
We're going to keep a close eye

672
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,055
on him, and, you know, if

673
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,431
anything happens, his health is

674
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,808
more important than the game to

675
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,311
us.

676
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:25,695
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

677
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,614
We'll now bring in Sylvia,

678
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,699
returning from Exile Island.

679
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,538
First things first.

680
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,540
Edgardo, bring me the immunity

681
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,542
idol, please.

682
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,627
Thank you.

683
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,631
Once again, immunity is back up

684
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,925
for grabs.

685
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,635
For today's challenge, you will

686
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,594
compete head-to-head in a

687
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,680
food-eating competition.

688
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,518
Ravu very excited to have food.

689
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,437
>> We're hungry!

690
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,480
We're a lot hungrier than those

691
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,898
guys, there.

692
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,108
>> PROBST: First tribe member

693
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,401
to get their food down scores a

694
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,652
point for their tribe.

695
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,029
First tribe to four wins

696
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,531
immunity, guaranteed at least

697
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,658
another day out here in Fiji.

698
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,702
Losers, Tribal Council tonight,

699
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,580
somebody will be going home.

700
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,665
First round, Liliana for Moto

701
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,626
taking on Rocky from Ravu.

702
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,711
I can assure you, everything

703
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,045
you're going to eat today

704
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,547
Fijians eat.

705
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,927
First round is giant clams.

706
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,762
(everyone groaning)

707
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,930
>> PROBST: Eat it however you

708
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:34,973
can get it down.

709
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,057
When you're done, show me an

710
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:36,558
empty mouth.

711
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,310
If there's still something in

712
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,436
there, I'll let you know.

713
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,228
If you're good, I'll say you

714
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:40,687
win.

715
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,607
Three, two, one, eat.

716
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,567
Rocky shoves it down his mouth.

717
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,527
Trying to swallow it.

718
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,862
Liliana taking her time and

719
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,614
chewing.

720
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,199
That's a lot of giant clam.

721
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,366
No, you're not done.

722
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,534
A little bit in the teeth.

723
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,703
No, Rocky!

724
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,622
For Ravu.

725
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,706
Liliana, you still got it

726
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,166
hanging down.

727
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,709
Ravu leads one-zip.

728
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,753
Just so we're clear, when I say

729
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,837
empty mouth, it's got to be

730
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,255
empty.

731
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:07,839
If you got stuff hanging down,

732
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,717
it's not empty.

733
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,845
Next round is Sylvia for Ravu

734
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,931
taking on Dreamz for Moto.

735
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:16,723
>> Sylvia, you're hungry.

736
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,724
>> PROBST: Octopus.

737
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,643
You will each eat one octopus

738
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,728
tentacle.

739
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,357
Ready?

740
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,733
Three, two, one, eat.

741
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,196
Those are big tentacles.

742
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,072
Dreamz's chewing that like a

743
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,032
piece of beef jerky.

744
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,034
Sylvia's torn hers all apart

745
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,870
into bite-size.

746
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,247
>> Attagirl!

747
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,580
Let's go!

748
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,499
>> PROBST: We are very close

749
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:42,791
once again.

750
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,459
Sylvia getting a lot of hers

751
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,544
down.

752
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:48,797
Very close.

753
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,131
Got to show me a completely

754
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,800
empty mouth.

755
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,095
Who can swallow fastest?

756
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,012
Sylvia got a little nub on

757
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:56,221
there.

758
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,098
Don't lose it.

759
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:02,560
Dre has it for Moto!

760
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,480
We are tied one-one.

761
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,274
Next round is Lisi taking on

762
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,650
Mookie.

763
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,404
Peanut worms.

764
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,909
Moto leads two-one.

765
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,785
You're playing to five.

766
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,454
Three, two, one, eat.

767
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:21,788
>> Go!

768
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,832
>> PROBST: Mookie digging in,

769
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,751
chewing on those peanut worms.

770
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,796
Lisi off to a slower start.

771
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:30,964
>> Yeah!

772
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:31,881
Chew it up!

773
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,173
Chew it up!

774
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:32,799
>> PROBST: Mookie not messing

775
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,510
around.

776
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,678
Lisi is in trouble.

777
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,762
Not looking good for Moto on

778
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,638
this one.

779
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,765
>> Come on, Mook.

780
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,683
Come on!

781
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,892
>> You're good.

782
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,602
One more, baby, one more!

783
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,271
>> PROBST: Mookie taunting

784
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,398
Lisi, trying to get her to

785
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,608
vomit.

786
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,694
Trying to get her to throw up.

787
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,239
Mookie very close for Ravu.

788
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:56,823
>> Show me the money, Mook!

789
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,743
Show me the money, Mook.

790
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,994
>> PROBST: Mookie has it for

791
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,996
Ravu!

792
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,998
Ravu leads two-one.

793
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,542
>> Was it nasty?

794
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,084
>> It was nasty.

795
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:08,835
>> PROBST: You didn't like the

796
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,836
taunting?

797
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,505
>> Well, no, not at all.

798
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,089
I mean, that-- that might have

799
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,133
just have stopped our goodwill

800
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:15,675
towards them.

801
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,886
Goodwill and sportsmanship is

802
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,388
to be humble.

803
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,599
>> You guys taunt, too, bro.

804
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,892
It's not one-sided brother.

805
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:24,934
>> We don't taunt, and we still

806
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:25,810
wish all the best of luck.

807
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,353
>> I wish you the best of

808
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,604
luck too, but it's all fair in

809
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,730
love and war, baby.

810
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,398
Chill out; relax.

811
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:30,940
You blow off two people and

812
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:35,362
then tell me how you feel, bro.

813
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,321
>> PROBST: Ready to keep going?

814
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,113
>> Yeah.

815
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:37,739
>> Please.

816
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,532
>> PROBST: It's going to be

for Moto.

819
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,162
Sea cucumber.

820
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:44,996
>> Easy, bro.

821
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,122
>> Got it.

822
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,958
>> PROBST: Three, two, one, go.

823
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,709
Earl can't even hold on to his,

824
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,796
he's so excited to eat.

825
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,589
>> All right, Alex, come on.

826
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,048
Come on!

827
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,634
>> Come on, Alex!

828
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,427
Come on, Alex!

830
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,763
second piece of sea cucumber.

831
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,722
Earl still working on his first.

832
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,474
>> Come on, Earl!

833
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,100
You're behind, baby!

834
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,851
Come on.

835
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,811
>> PROBST: Alex now on his

836
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,397
third and final piece of sea

837
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,356
cucumber.

838
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,607
>> Swallow it!

839
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,651
Swallow it!

840
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,568
>> PROBST: Earl, it's mind over

841
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,362
matter.

842
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,197
>> Come on!

843
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,864
>> Come on, Earl.

844
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,365
Come on, come on, baby.

845
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,700
>> PROBST: Does he have it?

846
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,159
Alex has it for Moto!

847
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,120
We are tied two-two.

848
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,122
>> No water... no water...

849
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,124
>> It wouldn't go down?

850
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,750
>> Yeah-- no water.

851
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,335

Edgardo for Moto.

854
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,300
Fish eyes.

855
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,470
>> Nice, Michelle.

856
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,139
>> PROBST: Three, two, one.

857
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,057
Eat.

858
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,183
Edgardo just swallowing, not

859
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,518
even messing around.

860
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,186
Michelle quickly falling behind.

861
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,979
>> Come on, Michelle!

862
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,980
Come on, Michelle!

863
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:52,981
Come on, Michelle!

Moto leads three-two.

868
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,112
>> Yes!

869
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,488
>> That's okay, Michelle.

870
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,490
That's all right, baby.

871
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,575
>> PROBST: This could be the

872
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,160
last round.

873
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,829

for Moto, taking on Anthony for

875
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,583
Ravu.

876
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,000
A lot on the line.

877
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,252
Gary, you could win immunity

878
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,254
again for Moto.

879
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,964
Anthony, fate is in your hands.

880
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,341
You have to win or you guys are

881
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,885
going to Tribal Council tonight.

882
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,099
Let's see how you do with pig

883
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,018
snouts.

884
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,187
Still a little hair on the

885
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,272
snout.

886
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:36,733
>> Come on, baby!

887
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,152

888
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,362

>> Papa Smurf!

891
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:45,992
>> Papa.

892
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,952
>> Let's go, Anthony!

893
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,495
>> PROBST: Gary like he's

894
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,038
done it every day of his life.

895
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,041
Hammering that snout down.

896
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,709
Anthony struggling to get it

897
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,919
down.

898
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:56,544
>> Hey, you don't got to chew

899
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,712
all of it.

900
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:58,338
You don't got to chew all of it.

901
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,422
Just swallow, baby.

902
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,048
>> We're behind, baby, come on!

903
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,425
Chew fast!

904
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,051
>> PROBST: Papa Smurf starting

905
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,844

>> Come on, Papa Smurf.

907
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,015
>> PROBST: Anthony has really

908
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,725
slowed down his chewing.

909
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,060
>> Come on Anthony!

910
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,479

911
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,189

Anthony still struggling with

914
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,151
that first bite.

915
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,488
>> TEAM: Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

916
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,281
Papa Smurf!

917
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,407
>> PROBST: Moto wins immunity

918
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,493
again!

919
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,421
Moto remains undefeated so far

920
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,048
in this game.

921
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,841
Ravu, still winless, more bad

922
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,051
news, Tribal Council tonight.

923
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,970
Another member of your tribe

924
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,054
going home.

925
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,681
Grab your bags, head back to

926
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,098
camp.

927
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,267
See you at Tribal.

928
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,070
(squawking, chittering)

929
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,365
>> (yells)

930
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,659
We lost again.

931
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,910
>> That was a tough challenge.

932
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,161
Hey.

933
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,163
>> Four times in a row is hard.

934
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,498
What are you gonna do?

935
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,124
>> I just want to let you guys

936
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,501
know I was absolutely mortified

937
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,794
yesterday by my performance,

938
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:20,503
okay?

939
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,129
I just wanted to say I'm really

940
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,506
sorry that I let the team down

941
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,174
on that one challenge.

942
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,884
>> If, at the moment, that was

943
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,553
the best you can do, then...

944
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,679
>> Okay, thanks for letting me

945
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,722
get it off my chest.

946
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,723
(indistinct chatter)

947
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,224
I don't know if the tribe is

948
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,809
still connected to me.

949
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:35,435
I certainly still feel connected

950
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,020
to the tribe.

951
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,189
But I was gone for almost 24

952
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,359
hours, and... I've been a target

953
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,986
since first day.

954
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,988
Because I'm definitely the

955
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,324
oldest woman, and the least

956
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,326
amount of strength, probably the

957
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,827
least amount of skills.

958
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,787
It is absolutely essential that

959
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,372
I find the idol before Tribal

960
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,082
Council, or else I will be the

961
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:12,180
next one voted off.

962
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,973
>> She's trying a bit too hard.

963
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:14,515
>> I'm right there with you.

964
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,142
I'm just trying to keep my butt

965
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,018
in the game.

966
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:17,518
I'm trying not to scramble

967
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,187
around too much.

968
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,189
I think that Sylvia's getting

969
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,191
voted out tonight.

970
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,276
Probably the most interesting

971
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,778
complication that can happen

972
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,363
during Tribal Council will be if

973
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,199
Sylvia actually has the idol.

974
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,116
And if she breaks it out, it's

975
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,369
gonna change up some...

976
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,411
everything.

977
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,581
Because whoever she picks...

978
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,083
goes home.

979
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,626
>> So, let's run over what we're

980
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,919
gonna do tonight, huh?

981
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:43,670
>> Um...

982
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,505
>> Sylvia's... Basically, the

983
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,048
majority, uh, is gonna vote for

984
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,716
Sylvia on this one, all right?

985
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,717
>> Okay. Mm-hmm.

986
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,385
>> And then, to back it up, just

987
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,261
in case she does have the idol--

988
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,554
'cause, you know, she's playing

989
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,222
off like she doesn't, but not a

990
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,683
big deal-- we'll put Anthony's

991
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,226
name in there, too, 'cause we...

992
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,143
>> So we have a backup.

993
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,144
>> Yeah. Cool?

994
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,145
>> Sounds like a plan.

995
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,064
>> Ready, break?

996
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,107
Ready, break. All right.

997
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,733
>> James approached me and said

998
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,235
that the plan was that Sylvia

999
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,071
was gonna be voted out unless

1000
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,989
she had the immunity idol, and,

1001
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,741
then, in which case, we would be

1002
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,242
voting, uh, Anthony out.

1003
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,744
>> Does he irk you at all, or

1004
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,746
no?

1005
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,292
Yeah.

1006
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,627
He just seems like a... like

1007
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,962
a... like a... a little on the

1008
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:26,921
whiny side, you know?

1009
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:27,714
>> Well, like, he's so

1010
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,423
wishy-washy.

1011
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,716
>> Yeah.

1012
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,008
>> I don't want to vote out

1013
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,176
either Sylvia or Anthony.

1014
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,762
We've made our voting decisions,

1015
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,180
supposedly, to try to make the

1016
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,306
tribe stronger, but the

1017
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,183
reality is that it hasn't.

1018
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,728
So I'm gonna do something that's

1019
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:47,150
not "with the tribe."

1020
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,193
>> Anthony, he's... he's the

1021
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,028
most, you know...

1022
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:51,654
I don't know what's going on in

1023
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,405
his mind.

1024
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,740
And especially today, when

1025
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,699
someone puts a gun to your head,

1026
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,033
"Finish this in a minute."

1027
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:56,617
I don't care if you have no

1028
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,994
water in your mouth, you're

1029
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:58,703
going to finish it.

1030
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,328
He was still on the same little

1031
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,121
bit, and then he's, like,

1032
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,247
complaining about it.

1033
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,374
>> That bothered you, huh?

1034
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,709
>> This bit!

1035
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,085
Anthony just... I was not happy

1036
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,047
at all with his performance in

1037
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,422
the challenge.

1038
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,798
He's just not that strong, and I

1039
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,133
think it's just the effort that

1040
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,301
he put forward that just really

1041
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,012
irritated me.

1042
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:16,304
So, uh...

1043
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,847
>> Mm-hmm?

1044
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,723
>> Where's Anthony?

1045
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,017
>> Not around.

1046
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,601
>> So you're good with that,

1047
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,186
Sylvia?

1048
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,729
>> Mm-hmm, yeah.

1049
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,189
>> Okay.

1050
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,190
>> I'm good.

1051
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,984
I'm not sure how it's going to

1052
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:30,401
go tonight.

1053
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,862
I mean, I hear, supposedly, that

1054
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,781
majority is going to vote for

1055
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,074
Anthony, but I'm not feeling

1056
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,702
really absolutely certain.

1057
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,412
I am pretty sure I know where

1058
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,039
the idol is.

1059
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,582
From the three clues that have

1060
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,501
been given out so far, it seems

1061
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,045
to me that it's going to be at

1062
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,048
the threshold of the tallest

1063
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,301
point of the cave.

1064
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,094
So I still have a little bit of

1065
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,513
time before Tribal Council, and

1066
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,305
I'm going to dig right now and

1067
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,516
try to get that idol as my

1068
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,352
insurance policy.

1069
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,729
If I get the idol now, and if

1070
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,439
the vote does go my way, I will

1071
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:35,299
be able to surprise everybody.

1072
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,759
>> PROBST: Let's start with a

1073
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,636
quick poll, one word answers.

1074
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,304
What is the state of the tribe?

1075
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:40,555
Anthony.

1076
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,973
>> Tired.

1077
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,849
>> PROBST: Yau-Man.

1078
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,267
>> Not very happy.

1079
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,184
>> PROBST: Michelle.

1080
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:45,977
>> Hungry.

1081
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,936
>> PROBST: Rocky.

1082
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,728
>> Tired.

1083
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,688
>> PROBST: Mookie.

1084
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,647
>> Bad.

1085
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,982
>> PROBST: I'm watching a group

1086
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,399
of people that are

1087
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,317
disintegrating, emotionally,

1088
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,777
before my eyes.

1089
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,737
Mookie, what needs to happen

1090
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,155
with this tribe?

1091
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:58,739
The game is slipping through

1092
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,116
your fingers.

1093
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:00,741
>> We need to come through in a

1094
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,784
challenge.

1095
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,077
Uh, I think the more we lose,

1096
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,662
the idea the rich get richer,

1097
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,788
the poor get poorer, comes

1098
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,164
to seep into our minds, and,

1099
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,583
uh, it's starting to mess with

1100
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,750
us, definitely.

1101
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,002
>> PROBST: Sylvia, you struggled

1102
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,920
in the reward challenge.

1103
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,921
>> I did.

1104
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,214
I mean, I was just mortified for

1105
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,008
disappointing the tribe, for not

1106
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,509
getting that one more basket in.

1107
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,218
The second thing was a little

1108
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,680
bit of self-performance here:

1109
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,099
why are you not able to do the

1110
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,434
clutch move when you need to do

1111
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,393
it?

1112
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,146
>> PROBST: Anthony, today, you

1113
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,356
squared off against Gary-- Papa

1114
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,608
Smurf.

1115
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,984
The head-to-head between you two

1116
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,820
guys was over before it started.

1117
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,821
>> I was just trying to swallow,

1118
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,281
and I had no spit to swallow.

1119
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,158
You know, I was out here in the

1120
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:42,783
tropics chewing pig snout and

1121
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,367
enjoying it.

1122
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,411
I just couldn't swallow it.

1123
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,455
>> PROBST: Rocky, trust.

1124
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,373
Does it start to become even

1125
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,792
more difficult, when you lose

1126
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,252
time after time after time,

1127
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:53,628
to trust people?

1128
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,378
>> I think it becomes more

1129
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,213
important.

1130
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,089
You have to trust that there is

1131
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:57,673
a possibility that one day you

1132
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,382
are going to snap out of this

1133
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,051
and you're going to start

1134
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:00,885
winning.

1135
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,886
If you lose that, you might as

1136
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,221
well just not even show up to

1137
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,597
the game.

1138
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,223
>> PROBST: Anthony, Mookie

1139
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,100
trustworthy?

1140
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:08,809
>> I think Mookie is pretty

1141
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,852
trustworthy.

1142
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,478
I'm generally the person who,

1143
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,855
for the most part, gives people

1144
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,231
the benefit of the doubt.

1145
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:14,899
>> PROBST: The problem with that

1146
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:15,483
is, by the time you figure out

1147
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,317
you can't trust him, it could be

1148
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,569
as you're walking out of here.

1149
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,488
>> You know, I often wonder

1150
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,239
if the... if these folks even

1151
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:22,490
like me.

1152
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,783
I think... I like to think they

1153
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:24,867
like me, but you know, sometimes

1154
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,410
you can't tell.

1155
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,453
>> PROBST: Mookie, what's your

1156
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,205
thought on what Anthony said?

1157
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,873
>> To be honest, after the

1158
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,084
challenge, I was really pissed

1159
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,293
off.

1160
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,461
And one person that just brought

1161
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,255
me over the top was Anthony.

1162
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,132
I understand that it's hard to

1163
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,425
swallow, but when you take a

1164
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,718
little piece of snout this

1165
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,553
small, you can will yourself to

1166
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,263
throw it down.

1167
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:46,847
>> PROBST: Anthony, he's not

1168
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,431
only saying you didn't have

1169
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,392
enough effort today, he's

1170
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,395
questioning your will to win.

1171
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,396
>> I have the will to win.

1172
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,438
I have the will to be here.

1173
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,439
I have the will to keep going

1174
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,857
through this game.

1175
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,234
I'm out there in the same stuff

1176
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,277
with you, dude.

1177
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,819
I guess I pissed you off.

1178
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,904
Okay, fine.

1179
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:02,905
But, you know, you want to

1180
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:03,364
question my will...

1181
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:03,948
>> I don't... I don't want to

1182
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:04,365
make it personal.

1183
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,950
The thing is...

1184
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:06,659
>> Well, you know, it's gonna

1185
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,284
be personal.

1186
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,119
>> Not everyone was able to put

1187
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:08,411
it down.

1188
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,036
>> Well, apparently I'm the only

1189
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,331
one who put you over the top.

1190
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,874
>> PROBST: One last topic to

1191
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,376
talk about: hidden immunity

1192
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:15,543
idol.

1193
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,460
Earl's been out there once,

1194
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,754
Sylvia twice.

1195
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,131
What was the mood back at camp

1196
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,966
today, Rocky, knowing she had

1197
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,300
three clues?

1198
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:23,926
Were you trying to figure out if

1199
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,053
she had the idol or not?

1200
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,013
>> Of course we are.

1201
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,222
She could be holding it in her

1202
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:28,681
back pocket right now.

1203
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,933
I don't know.

1204
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,517
>> PROBST: Okay, if somebody

1205
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,561
does indeed have the hidden

1206
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,478
immunity idol and you want to

1207
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,605
play it, you would play it after

1208
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,398
the votes have been cast, before

1209
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,441
I read them.

1210
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,401
It is time to vote.

1211
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:48,868
Mookie, you're up.

1212
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,453
>> It's not your will.

1213
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,914
It's your attitude.

1214
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,635
>> I just got to know if you

1215
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,306
have the idol or not.

1216
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,663
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1217
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,834
votes.

1218
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,548
>> PROBST: If you have the

1219
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,759
hidden immunity idol and you

1220
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,552
want to play it, now is the time

1221
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:52,264
to do so.

1222
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,980
Once the votes are read, the

1223
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:00,940
decision is final.

1224
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:01,857
The person voted out will be

1225
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,691
asked to leave the Tribal

1226
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,653
Council area immediately.

1227
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:10,324
First vote, Sylvia.

1228
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:17,540
Anthony.

1229
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,125
Sylvia.

1230
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:19,667
Two votes Sylvia, one vote

1231
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,171
Anthony.

1232
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:29,802
Anthony-- two votes Anthony.

1233
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:35,307
Sylvia-- three votes Sylvia.

1234
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,517
Anthony.

1235
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,893
We're tied: three votes

1236
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:42,148
Anthony, three votes Sylvia.

1237
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,442
Earl.

1238
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,569
That's one vote Earl, three

1239
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,612
votes Anthony, three votes

1240
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:52,992
Sylvia, one vote left.

1241
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,290
Third person voted out of

1242
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,918
<i>Survivor: Fiji...</i> Sylvia.

1243
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,213
You need to bring me your torch.

1244
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:17,474
Sylvia, the tribe has spoken.

1245
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,518
Time for you to go.

1246
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,564
>> Good luck.

1247
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,072
>> PROBST: Well, one good thing

1248
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:32,907
that came out of tonight's

1249
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,950
Tribal Council: a little

1250
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,035
honesty.

1251
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:36,702
Maybe it will make a difference.

1252
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,537
Grab your torches.

1253
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,247
Go back to camp.

1254
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:51,634
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1255
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,676
from our next episode.

1256
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,765
>> PROBST: Next time on

1257
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,724
<i>Survivor:</i>

1258
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,226
>> I just can't... I can't

1259
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:00,768
function.

1260
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,102
>> PROBST: Gary breaks down.

1261
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,187
>> His head spinning is just

1262
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,854
getting worse.

1263
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,563
>> If he doesn't get better,

1264
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,105
he's going to have to go.

1265
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:05,731
>> PROBST: Liliana makes a move

1266
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,650
on the guys.

1267
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,361
(laughing)

1268
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,071
And Anthony takes a beating.

1269
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:12,655
>> You get all sentimental and

1270
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,406
sensitive.

1271
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,241
>> There's no way in hell I'm

1272
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,868
gonna give it up.

1273
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,375
>> So I've been had, and, um,

1274
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,709
I'm not too happy about it.

1275
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,419
Um, I actually really, really

1276
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,421
liked the entire group of both

1277
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,464
tribes because we had three days

1278
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:31,840
to get to know everybody, and

1279
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,301
I'm not that angry or resentful

1280
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,469
right now.

1281
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:36,011
I'm just looking forward to

1282
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,888
seeing them all after they've

1283
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,556
clawed each other's eyes out

1284
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,642
later on.
