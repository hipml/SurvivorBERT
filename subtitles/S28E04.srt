2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,710
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,000
18 new castaways 
were divided into 3 tribes:

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,050
Muscle, Intelligence and Beauty.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,710
And in eight days, things 
were anything but predictable.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,560
In the Muscle tribe, 
Tony, who played alone...

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,110
I am alone. 
It's me, myself,

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,080
my idol, and me again. 
We are four.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,230
...formed several alliances.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,950
I am with you.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,400
You only have me, and vice versa.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,260
Even lying to a 
police colleague to achieve his ends.

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,040
Cliff and Lindsey want to eliminate you.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,130
It was a lie 
to lure him to my side.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,290
The Intelligence tribe 
was a disaster.

16
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,200
On what criteria were 
the Intelligents chosen?

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,180
I would like to see this data.

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,460
And for the Beauty tribe, 
nothing could go wrong.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,480
But in the immunity test, 
everything changed.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,510
The Beauty Tribe is falling apart!

21
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,420
For the first time, 
Intelligence did not lose.

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,540
The Intelligence tribe gains immunity!

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,510
And Beauty lost 
her first immunity test.

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,280
Approaching the board,

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,090
Jeremiah was caught 
between two alliances.

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,200
Alexis, Jefra and LJ, 
and Brice and Morgan.

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,810
I am stuck.

28
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,110
At the tribal council,

29
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,620
he rallied the majority...

30
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,830
Third person eliminated 
from Survivor Cagayan.

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,480
...eliminating Brice, and leaving 
Morgan alone, in bad shape.

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,990
There are fifteen left, 
who will be eliminated tonight?

33
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,860
Let's try not to do that again.

34
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,950
It cost me a lot.

35
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,940
There, I am 
emotionally paralyzed.

36
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,360
The counseling did 
not go as planned.

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,810
I am furious and frustrated.

38
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,460
Jeremiah is a little coward, 
he chickened out.

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,070
He came to us, 
then he changed sides.

40
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,710
It is very likely 
that I will leave next,

41
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,160
unless I manage to save myself.

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,470
Jeremiah, why 
did you change your mind?

43
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,130
You and Brice approached me 
with this idea.

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,580
And suddenly, you vote for Brice.

45
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,950
I am confused.

46
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,130
I say. It's that...

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,230
My first alliance was 
with LJ, Alexis and Jefra.

48
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,080
I gave them 
my word, and I thought

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,040
that was 
the best way for me.

50
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,790
He is incredibly good, 
socially.

51
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,110
- Brice or LJ? 
- Brian. It is good.

52
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,970
It scared me.

53
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,670
Morgan confronted me 
in front of everyone.

54
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,200
She asked me why 
I changed my mind,

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,340
in front of everybody. 
Well, no problem.

56
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,880
It's Survivor.

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,660
It was a big decision 
for me tonight.

58
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,740
It was trying. We'll see 
if it was a stupid move.

59
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,280
Alexis, sorry 
to have voted for you, but...

60
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,700
I do not know.

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,440
Four days ago, Jeremiah launched 
this witch hunt against LJ.

62
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,960
He came to see us, 
Brice and me, and told us

63
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,230
that LJ had to go out, 
that he was his main opponent.

64
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,180
All that stuff he's willing 
to sacrifice his partner

65
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,430
because we need 
LJ in the trials.

66
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,320
- I'm sorry, Alexis. 
- So I was an easy target.

67
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm skeptical 
of what Morgan says,

68
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,090
that it was Jeremiah 
who planned to eliminate me.

69
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,870
But the way she says it, 
it seems vaguely plausible.

70
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,410
Thanks for your honesty.

71
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,460
So I have to keep an eye on it.

72
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,170
Jeremiah? I do not know.

73
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,730
I think he stuck 
a big target in his back.

74
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,300
We have mail.

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,360
"Can you see yourself in chief?

76
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,560
Can you see your tribe falling?

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,840
Can you see protein 
at the end of the win?

78
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,980
When you ca 
n't see anything at all."

79
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,240
This is the game 
blindfolded and the guide.

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,490
Apparently, 
it's just a reward.

81
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,050
Yes, probably.

82
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,470
It is an important test.

83
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,460
We want to consolidate our victory.

84
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,750
We want to show that our tribe 
is capable of playing.

85
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,600
- Coaching. 
- We can do it.

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,410
Let's visualize this.

87
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,020
Spencer, right.

88
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,620
Honestly, I was thinking 
of leaving last time.

89
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,490
Just like the time before.

90
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,610
Because I threw away the rice. 
It is because of me that we are hungry.

91
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,690
I'Tia, left.

92
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,200
I want to help them 
with food,

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,100
because I put us 
in this situation.

94
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm going to rock 
in this ordeal.

95
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,500
J'Tia, a little to the left.

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,650
Over here, everyone!

97
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,930
discover the new Beauty tribe.

98
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,740
Brice was eliminated from the council.

99
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,200
Ready for 
today's reward event?

100
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,790
Today, 
one person will be your guide.

101
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,340
The rest of the tribe 
will be blindfolded.

102
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,350
Only by voice, the guide 
will lead a pair of team members

103
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,640
to collect five items.

104
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,010
As soon as you have one, 
you have to bring it back

105
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,680
and hoist it up to the guide.

106
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
Once all five items have been collected,

107
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,700
the guide will send you to 
get a flag.

108
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,290
The first two tribes 
to bring back their flag

109
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,970
to their guide 
earn a reward.

110
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,770
Normally, I would ask 
you if you want to know what is at stake,

111
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,520
but I believe you hear it.

112
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,050
- Want to see what's at stake? 
- Yes!

113
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,720
For the first tribe:

114
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,620
three laying hens and a rooster.

115
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,490
For the second tribe:

116
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,930
A dozen eggs. 
Not as good, but not bad.

117
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,470
Anything.

118
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,690
Muscle, two people 
will not participate.

119
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,190
Keep in mind 
that the same people

120
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,400
cannot stay away 
two races in a row.

121
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,130
Woo and Sarah will not participate.

122
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,510
- Beauty, you have one more member. 
- I'm not participating.

123
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,250
Morgan is not participating 
for the Beauty Tribe.

124
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,410
One minute to organize yourself, 
and we'll begin.

125
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,610
Alright, here we go. 
For the reward,

126
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,770
Survivors, ready?

127
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,660
Left, left!

128
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,870
Straight ahead, five steps!

129
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,560
Communication is the key.

130
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,860
Kass, you got it!

131
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,470
Kass and Spencer have an item 
for the Intelligence tribe.

132
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,140
LJ and Jefra have an item 
for the Beauty Tribe.

133
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,790
A bit more! Its good!

134
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,250
Once back, you have 
to put it on the platform

135
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,800
and hoist it.

136
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,320
It takes a lot of teamwork 
and coordination.

137
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,790
Shoot, shoot!

138
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,940
And then it falls.

139
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,120
Carry on!

140
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,140
Beauty is the first tribe 
to bring back an object

141
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,770
- and to hoist it to its guide. 
- Carry on!

142
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,460
Cliff sends his tribe 
to the farthest place

143
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,300
to start with the hardest.

144
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,720
Intelligence is always 
on its first object.

145
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,410
They are close. 
Tasha has it!

146
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,350
Each tribe must 
collect five items,

147
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,900
no longer their flag.

148
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,420
Beauty has its second object.

149
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,120
Tony and Lindsey bring back 
the first object for Muscle.

150
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Put it there, drop it. 
Splendid.

151
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,960
LJ, left.

152
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,020
The only place 
we would like to avoid,

153
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,940
and LJ got it.

154
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,160
- That's it? 
- Yes!

155
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,020
The Intelligence tribe 
has its second object.

156
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,710
Now we have to come back.

157
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,280
- Muscle has its first object. 
- Let's go!

158
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,150
Beauty now has 
its second object, that's it.

159
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,080
While Muscle 
goes to get his second object.

160
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,170
Lindsey takes a punch in the stomach.

161
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,660
LJ and Jefra return 
with their third item.

162
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,880
Great teamwork 
from the Beauty tribe.

163
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,230
- PULL! Stop! 
- Intelligence has its second object.

164
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,570
They can leave.

165
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,040
Tony and Lindsey have 
the second object for Muscle,

166
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,650
but they have to bring it back.

167
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,700
Left, Spencer, left!

168
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,170
- How are you? 
- Stop, let them pass!

169
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,320
- I got it! 
- Beauty is in the lead.

170
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,040
They have their third object.

171
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,560
Come on, let's go, over here!

172
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,790
Straight! 
You will bump into yourself!

173
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,600
Sorry.

174
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,250
LJ starts to get frustrated.

175
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,090
- To the left! 
- Right, right, LJ!

176
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,940
Okay, forward!

177
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,050
Spencer and Kass return 
with their third item.

178
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,640
Spencer takes a bad hit 
in the same spot as LJ.

179
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,780
- I got it. 
- Yeah!

180
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,930
Muscle has its second object. 
They're going to get the third one.

181
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,370
Straight on, LJ, straight on! 
Okay, stop, LJ!

182
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,200
To your right, LJ!

183
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,250
Intelligence hoists 
its third object.

184
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,260
I got it, let go!

185
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,960
Three for Intelligence, 
three for Beauty, two for Muscle.

186
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,430
Beauty returns 
with its fourth object.

187
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,680
This ordeal will leave 
its mark, that's for sure.

188
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,930
-LJ! 
- Come on, stay with me!

189
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,990
Muscle returns 
with its third item.

190
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,760
Go on! Turn around! Picked up!

191
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,390
Intelligence returns 
with a fourth object.

192
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,710
Beauty hoists her fourth object.

193
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,260
- I got it! 
- Alexis has it!

194
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,820
Beauty takes the lead.

195
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,730
- I got it! 
- Muscle has its third object.

196
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,370
Straight! Hurry up!

197
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,700
Intelligence hoists its fourth object.

198
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,850
I got it!

199
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,720
Equality.

200
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,440
Intelligence and Beauty 
have four, Muscle have three.

201
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,660
Right, right!

202
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,820
- I can not hear you. 
- Straight!

203
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,940
- Yeah, let's go! 
- Beauty has its fifth object.

204
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,360
- All right, LJ. 
- Intelligence has its fifth object.

205
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,740
- Straight! 
- It was neck and neck the whole time.

206
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,260
Come on, hurry up!

207
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,460
Tony has the fourth item for Muscle.

208
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,790
Got it, here we go, Linds.

209
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,510
Beauty returns 
with its fifth object.

210
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,260
- That's perfect. 
- Run, run!

211
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,490
Spencer and Kass return 
with their fifth object.

212
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,830
Kass crashes into a barrel. 
It will leave a mark.

213
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,670
- Ready? PULL! 
- Beauty and Intelligence neck and neck.

214
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,160
Carry on! Come on, Spencer!

215
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,910
- Intelligence loses its object. 
- Get her back down!

216
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,880
- Got it, go ahead! 
- Beauty takes the lead.

217
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,800
All they need now is 
their tribe's flag.

218
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,420
Intelligence has just 
made a big mistake.

219
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,860
Yeah, spear, Ton!

220
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,540
Come on, we're late, 
we have to put the package!

221
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,320
Intelligence tries again 
to hoist this fifth object.

222
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,100
Intelligence leaves to seek its flag.

223
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,790
Muscle has its fourth object. 
He is upstairs.

224
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,390
Beauty leads. 
Intelligence is behind.

225
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,290
Muscle is losing ground.

226
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,640
Come on, get excited!

227
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,530
Straight!

228
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,340
LJ and Jefra have their flag, 
they're coming back.

229
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,830
Muscle returns with its fifth 
object. Hurry up!

230
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,690
LJ and Jefra are close 
to the goal and the victory.

231
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,090
Spencer, flag, flag!

232
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,870
- U-turn! 
- Lord!

233
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,300
Beauty is back with her flag, 
they just have to hoist it.

234
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,670
Kass and Spencer 
have their flag, they're coming back.

235
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,500
Two tribes earn a reward.

236
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,930
- Beauty is near. 
- ...Two three...

237
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,420
Closer and closer. 
Alexis has the flag!

238
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,680
Beauty wins the reward!

239
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,250
Three laying hens and a rooster!

240
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,700
Two, one, two! 
Let's go!

241
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,820
Cliff has the fifth item 
for the Muscle Tribe.

242
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,120
They can go back there.

243
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,020
Muscle goes to get his flag.

244
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,860
You must run!

245
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,410
Intelligence already has its own,

246
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,430
but they struggled 
to hoist their items.

247
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,090
Straight, straight!

248
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,600
Intelligence, 
back with its flag.

249
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,230
Tony and Lindsey 
look for their flag.

250
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,210
Can they reach it in time 
and come back? That's the question.

251
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,760
Pull it a little bit, that's it.

252
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,060
- Its good? 
- Yes.

253
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,240
This ordeal escapes them.

254
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,620
Tony waves his arms frantically.

255
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,780
The Intelligence flag 
is on the platform.

256
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,070
- Once again, it falls! 
- He fell, J'Tia!

257
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,520
Intelligence loses its means 
at the stage of the platform.

258
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,600
Tony and Lindsey have the 
Muscle Tribe flag.

259
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,950
You are still in the race!

260
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,780
- Come on, let's hurry! 
- Come on!

261
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,460
To the right!

262
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,090
Put it on the right.

263
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,350
Here it is, like this.

264
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,960
No, further forward! Nope!

265
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,790
I Tia try to place it 
on the platform,

266
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,750
while Tony and Lindsey 
run back.

267
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,690
We have real competition!

268
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,520
Oh, Lindsey takes another hit!

269
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,230
- She falls! 
- Hurry up!

270
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,370
Get your hand back! 
Your hand, not the flag!

271
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,560
- A little to the left. 
- Go on!

272
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,620
Go on!

273
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,350
J'Tia panic.

274
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,640
Intelligence fails 
to put it on the platform.

275
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,830
It will be an incredible comeback,

276
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,180
and a huge setback for Intelligence.

277
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
Go on!

278
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,270
Rise, rise!

279
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,230
Unbelievable! Muscle placed him 
on the platform!

280
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,220
- OK. 
- Let's go!

281
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,110
The Muscle Tribe hoists their flag.

282
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,230
A huge comeback!

283
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,200
Muscle finishes second, unheard of!

284
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,330
Intelligence loses the test, 
victory was at hand.

285
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,990
Never 
give up in this game!

286
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,290
It was hard.

287
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,720
No big deal, we did a good job.

288
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,510
Beauty, very good communication,

289
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,580
huge effort, big reward.

290
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,740
Three laying hens and a rooster.

291
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,160
Come get your reward, 
get your stuff,

292
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,180
return to camp and enjoy.

293
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,630
Muscle, good effort to go up.

294
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,770
Take your things, 
return to camp.

295
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,490
Enjoy your eggs.

296
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,530
Intelligence, 
a huge wasted opportunity.

297
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,100
Spencer, you threw away 
your bandana in disgust.

298
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,310
It's frustrating. We were so close.

299
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,560
We thought we would win, 
so the disappointment is huge.

300
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,280
Intelligence, 
I have nothing for you.

301
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,870
Grab your things 
and head back to camp.

302
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,950
This reward event 
was a lot of fun.

303
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,800
She kind of gathered the group together,

304
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,600
she reminded us that we are 
all here to win, to fight,

305
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,840
and we can win.

306
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,500
It's a beautiful day.

307
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,890
There's food left 
for them in there.

308
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,470
But we could 
give them a little more.

309
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,110
- Oh, a message! 
- Read the message!

310
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,940
"Walk along the rocks. 
It's easier at low tide.

311
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,910
Spend some time near the reef, 
and you could be protected tonight.

312
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,990
Attached to solid is 
the idol you seek,

313
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,600
well hidden, but not too deep. 
You'll have to get wet."

314
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,630
That is why? The hidden idol?

315
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,390
Oh yeah.

316
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,700
Jeremiah finds 
the clue for the idol in the bag.

317
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,190
Alas, everyone is there.

318
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,540
The clue was so precise.

319
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,690
Thank God I have it, because it 
would have been found today.

320
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,570
It would have been a collective idol, 
and therefore a huge problem.

321
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,310
I had never been so 
close to a live chicken.

322
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,630
So the rooster has 
to climb on one of the hens

323
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,380
- to make eggs? 
- I wondered.

324
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,150
- Nope. 
- Nope?

325
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,310
Are the eggs still coming out?

326
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,240
- Yes. 
- Yes.

327
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,650
- To make chicks. 
- So what is the rooster for?

328
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,350
There was a chicken and egg debate .

329
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,910
But I think 
they pretend to know.

330
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,000
So they are, what, asexual?

331
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,810
What makes them 
lay eggs?

332
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,390
They need something, like... 
A heat lamp.

333
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,180
No one knows how 
chickens are born.

334
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,660
I don't know, I...

335
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,380
I find it hard to believe that people 
can say such things.

336
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,180
You don't have any eggs, do you?

337
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,790
Ah, so a guy has to come and...

338
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,050
We have the 
Beauty tribe stereotype.

339
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,780
It's really unfortunate.

340
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,800
I don't think that's it.

341
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,220
I don't know.

342
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,980
I just know they 
taste really good.

343
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,310
We all know 
the egg was there before,

344
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,980
because the dinosaurs 
laid them.

345
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,370
And they were there 
before the chickens, so...

346
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
You'll be delicious, I'm sorry.

347
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,410
Do you do it or do you want 
me to?

348
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,550
- You can do it? 
- I will do it.

349
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,300
- I leave you. 
- Just in case.

350
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,220
It's a little hard, 
because after the advice,

351
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,800
I gotta work 
my southern charm,

352
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,260
stay in their good graces,

353
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,730
I try to take the lead 
and do as much as possible.

354
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,490
- Oh Lord. 
- Lord.

355
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,310
Oh my God.

356
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,340
It's a head, is it detached?

357
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,380
- Yes. 
- I know how to work.

358
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,950
He ripped it off.

359
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,080
Chickens don't need 
brains to function?

360
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,240
It will continue to move.

361
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,600
It was disgusting.

362
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,140
Jeremiah, looks 
like you've done this before.

363
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,750
I hope I scored 
some points today.

364
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,820
I grew up in the countryside, 
but I don't know anything about chickens.

365
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm a model, you know?

366
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,050
Jeremiah killed the chicken, 
and that's cool.

367
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,660
I will be able to eat it, 
I appreciate it, I will say thank you.

368
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,100
It's the best idea 
since we've been here.

369
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,100
But in the end, I do 
n't like Jeremiah at all.

370
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,140
He is dumb as his feet.

371
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,850
And he's a big liar.

372
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,290
I don't understand why 
he is in this tribe.

373
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,050
He is not handsome enough 
for the tribe of the handsomest.

374
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,650
We're going to have to stick together.

375
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,580
Of course we're going to have 
to stick together.

376
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,410
Sooner or later there will be...

377
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,780
A surprise elimination.

378
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,870
Don't take this the wrong way, but you 
guys are very emotional.

379
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,010
- Do you want me to do more? 
- Nope.

380
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,580
- Oh, let's go. 
- No, I do not want.

381
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,740
Cliff and Lindsey are very close.

382
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,440
They want to eliminate me.

383
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,340
Tony heard them and told me.

384
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,590
If you come after me, 
I'll come after you, only worse.

385
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,540
I want Cliff gone.

386
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,010
I like Cliff, but 
he doesn't need the money.

387
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,570
- We do. 
- Yeah.

388
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,870
What if we lose... 
The next... Cliff?

389
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,290
- Possible. 
- Good.

390
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,120
It's a big 
necessary move in this game.

391
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,500
We are young. 
You know what I mean?

392
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,260
- It's our turn to shine. 
- I agree.

393
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,360
Woo would turn on Cliff, 
that surprised me.

394
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,320
He has a nonchalant attitude.

395
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,140
Me too.

396
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,590
Woo really wants to win.

397
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,730
It is an impression, 
a feeling.

398
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,830
But I believe we are allies.

399
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,090
I like the idea 
that our chances of winning

400
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,030
- are much more important. 
- Than hers.

401
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,940
- He's already rich. 
- I say.

402
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,480
I really admire Cliff, 
he's a basketball superstar.

403
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,450
I have idealized him for a long time.

404
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,210
But it would be nice 
if one of us,

405
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,070
other than Cliff, become a millionaire.

406
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,730
When we say his name, 
it means it's time.

407
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,750
High five. OK?

408
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,730
I try to relate to the majority.

409
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,460
When the opportunity arises, 
I have to seize it.

410
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,050
In the end, I want us...

411
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,490
Yeah, I agree.

412
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,770
We agree.

413
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,550
We agree, Tony.

414
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,010
Just tell me 
what's going on, okay?

415
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,650
- Sure. 
- Yeah.

416
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,960
I saw Woo and Sarah whisper.

417
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,290
I asked what was going on.

418
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,760
I walked up, and they were...

419
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,400
Like a deer in the headlights, 
as soon as I approached.

420
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,440
I took Sarah aside 
to ask her what was going on.

421
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,170
Woo is with us.

422
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,740
- You are sure of it? 
- Positively.

423
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,010
A few days ago 
I lied to Sarah,

424
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,140
telling him that Cliff 
and Lindsey wanted to eliminate him.

425
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,860
I believe that from there,

426
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,190
I changed the game 
by luring him to my side.

427
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,630
I believe that now 
she is my ally.

428
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,060
Tell me the truth, 
I trust you,

429
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,990
I believe in your word.

430
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,370
You tell me to trust 
Woo, that's alright,

431
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,760
but I don't trust him.

432
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,930
For Sarah, Woo is on her side,

433
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,130
and therefore it is also mine.

434
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,240
So we have 
a covenant of four now,

435
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,000
against Cliff and Lindsey.

436
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,340
Swear on your badge 
not to betray me.

437
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,750
On everything I love, 
I will not betray you.

438
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,980
She made me swear on my badge.

439
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,590
It doesn't mean anything to me.

440
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,170
I'm here to 
lie, cheat and steal.

441
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,060
I'm here to destroy 
other people's dreams for my own.

442
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,070
I am here for this. 
I will do what it takes.

443
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,140
It's that simple.

444
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,080
Two cops in the final. 
We have never seen that.

445
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,490
A little mail.

446
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,790
Let's see.

447
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,860
“Castaway on an island 
is always swim or sink.

448
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,900
You will sink today 
if you don't score a basket.

449
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,250
The tribal council 
could be dismal."

450
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,410
Score a basket, man, 
score a basket.

451
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,810
It's you, Cliff.

452
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,200
We have an 
immunity test today.

453
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,020
And it could be basketball.

454
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,340
I'm sure everyone 
expects me to score,

455
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,110
because I played basketball.

456
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,700
It looks fun.

457
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,710
I spent 18 years in the NBA.

458
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,060
I was in the ten best 
players of all time.

459
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,340
I played more games 
than Michael Jordan,

460
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,440
So hopefully 
it will be a walk.

461
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,890
Here's the thing, Trish.

462
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,140
Come on, I listen to you.

463
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,780
First, Lindsey will not participate.

464
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,850
So you, me and Woo 
can easily lose on purpose.

465
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,120
I know we said 
we'd never lose on purpose,

466
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,590
because it doesn't work.

467
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,140
However, 
we cannot risk

468
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,550
that Cliff is still there 
during the merge.

469
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,340
I've never done anything like that, 
it's a funny feeling.

470
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,020
But I can do it, 
trust me.

471
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,630
Sounds stupid. 
Why renounce the majority?

472
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,520
But he's not in 
our majority, that's why.

473
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,120
It's Lindsey and him.

474
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,260
I was told that 
Cliff wanted to eliminate me.

475
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,190
So I'm doomed 
if Cliff's still here.

476
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,780
And if it shows that we lost 
on purpose, it doesn't matter. He will leave.

477
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,290
The problem is convincing Woo.

478
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,980
Let's lose on purpose and eliminate it.

479
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,780
Trish is in.

480
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,990
But we have the majority.

481
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,180
What if we merge?

482
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,820
Losing on purpose is not smart.

483
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,100
Some of them 
may want to do it,

484
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,740
but Cliff and I 
are very close.

485
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
And I can imagine it.

486
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,190
Putting baskets. 
Look at this throw!

487
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,680
It's undeniable. 
With my buddy Cliff!

488
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,890
But my allies 
think differently.

489
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,390
So what to do? 
Damn it!

490
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,740
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

491
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,520
Yeah.

492
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,670
First, approach 
the idols and throw them at me.

493
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,810
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

494
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,040
Today you will dive 
to release a buoy.

495
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,850
When you have it, come back, 
and the next one goes.

496
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,030
When you have all five buoys, 
you will throw them into a basket.

497
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,610
The first two tribes 
to achieve this

498
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,520
gain immunity, 
are protected from voting.

499
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,510
The losers will go to the council, 
where a fourth person will be eliminated.

500
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,900
Muscle, you're two more. 
Who will not participate?

501
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,440
Remember 
it can't be

502
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,840
the same people 
two events in a row.

503
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,850
Tony and Lindsey will not participate.

504
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,330
Beauty, you are one more. 
Who will not participate?

505
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,180
- Moi. 
- Alexis.

506
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,480
Alexis will not participate.

507
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,630
The others, you have 
one minute to organize yourselves

508
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,870
and we start.

509
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,610
For immunity, 
Survivors, ready?

510
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,590
J'Tia!

511
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,110
The first buoy is 
one meter deep.

512
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,930
It will be the easiest.

513
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,980
LJ goes up first 
for the Beauty tribe.

514
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,820
Woo reassembled for the Muscle Tribe.

515
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,610
J'Tia is still on it. 
She can not.

516
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,780
Jefra is in the water 
for the Beauty tribe.

517
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,100
Sarah is in the water 
for the Muscle Tribe.

518
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,030
Jefra has the second buoy 
of the Beauty tribe.

519
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,400
At only one meter deep, 
J'Tia does not succeed.

520
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,530
She comes back, 
wasting them a ton of time.

521
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,570
Sarah is still at work.

522
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,650
Now it's Tasha's turn.

523
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,820
She will try to bring back 
the buoy that J'Tia left.

524
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,930
Once again, Intelligence 
is quickly left behind.

525
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,360
Sarah finally has her buoy 
for the Muscle tribe.

526
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,200
It took him a long time.

527
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,020
She has it, Tasha comes back.

528
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,780
Morgan has the third buoy 
of the Beauty tribe.

529
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,370
Trish is in the water 
for the Muscle Tribe.

530
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,370
Tasha brought back the first 
intelligence tribe buoy.

531
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,220
Now it's Trish 
who's having trouble.

532
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,730
Jeremiah fetches the 
Beauty Tribe's fourth buoy.

533
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,430
Kass returns empty-handed.

534
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,630
The second member of Intelligence 
who returns empty-handed.

535
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,170
Spencer will try 
to shake things up.

536
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,080
Jeremiah returns with the fourth 
buoy of the Beauty tribe.

537
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,860
Trish returns empty-handed 
for the Muscle Tribe.

538
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,860
Giving Intelligence 
a chance to return.

539
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,810
Spencer brings back the second 
intelligence tribe buoy.

540
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,500
LJ goes to look for the fifth 
and last buoy.

541
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,770
Tasha goes to get 
the third buoy.

542
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,140
Cliff fetches the 
Muscle Tribe's third buoy.

543
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,480
Tasha comes up empty-handed.

544
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,900
LJ goes down to 4 meters 50

545
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,580
and quickly returns with 
the fifth and last buoy.

546
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,490
Go into the water, 
start casting.

547
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,330
The Beauty tribe dominates.

548
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,350
The Intelligence tribe is 
still on its third buoy.

549
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,800
Cliff has the third buoy.

550
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,520
Spencer has the third buoy.

551
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,160
They are neck and neck.

552
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,390
It's Jeremiah and Morgan shooting.

553
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,710
Jeremiah scores a first point.

554
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,770
Spencer returns to the water 
for Intelligence.

555
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,490
Jeremiah scores a second point 
for the Beauty tribe.

556
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,030
Woo must descend to 3.50 meters 
for the fourth buoy.

557
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,000
Spencer, back again 
with another buoy.

558
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,600
Spencer single-handedly keeps 
his team in the running.

559
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,590
Jeremiah scores a third point 
for the Beauty Tribe.

560
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,000
Woo comes back with 
the fourth buoy for Muscle.

561
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:09,110
4.50 meters, and Spencer brings 
in the fifth and last buoy.

562
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,570
Jeremiah scores a fourth point. 
Like at the carnival.

563
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,100
And that's it! 
The Beauty Tribe wins immunity!

564
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,120
Protected from the tribal council!

565
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,280
We need another tribe.

566
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,380
Spencer returns with the fifth 
buoy for Intelligence.

567
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,000
He's worn out.

568
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,320
Intelligence can start shooting.

569
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,990
Woo will have to descend to 4.50 meters 
to free the last buoy.

570
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,690
Spencer is going to shoot for Intelligence.

571
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,150
Intelligence has 
another problem now.

572
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,900
Neither of the two women in the water

573
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,190
can't get 
the ball back to Spencer.

574
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,440
Woo is still underwater 
for Muscle.

575
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,710
Can he bring back a buoy?

576
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,700
Woo has the fifth buoy 
for Muscle.

577
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,290
You must bring her back.

578
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,540
Spencer scores a first point 
for Intelligence.

579
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,490
Against all expectations, 
they remain in the race.

580
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,310
There you go, Muscle, you've got all five.

581
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,960
You can start shooting.

582
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,650
Spencer scores a second 
point for Intelligence.

583
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,300
It's a duel at the top 
between Spencer and Cliff.

584
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,820
Intelligence has two points, 
Muscle must place the five buoys.

585
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,740
Spencer's enters and exits.

586
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,660
Cliff scores a first 
point for Muscle.

587
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,140
Good job, good job!

588
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,000
You have to hurry 
if you want to bounce back.

589
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,330
J'Tia loses the buoy for Intelligence.

590
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,400
You need to get it back fast

591
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,020
to be able to shoot.

592
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
Cliff scores a second 
point for Muscle.

593
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,590
Tied, 2-2.

594
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,140
Cliff scores a third 
point for Muscle.

595
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,410
Spencer is still waiting for 
the ball, frustrated.

596
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,800
Make good passes, 
or you're wasting time.

597
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,160
Cliff scores a fourth point.

598
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,760
More than one for Muscle, 
is it this one?

599
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,590
Spencer scores a third 
point for Intelligence.

600
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,280
There are 4 to 3.

601
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,150
Cliff enters and exits.

602
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,830
Spencer shoots the fourth.

603
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,530
She goes in and out.

604
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,180
That's it, Cliff scores 
the fifth point for Muscle!

605
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,040
Muscle gains immunity!

606
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,510
Once again sending 
Intelligence to the council.

607
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,760
Here, Alexis.

608
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,420
Immunity for the Beauty Tribe.

609
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,240
No Tribal Council 
for the Muscle Tribe.

610
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,810
Intelligence, good effort, 
but just insufficient.

611
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,410
Once again, advice.

612
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,680
One of you will be 
the fourth eliminated from this game.

613
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,150
See you tonight at the council.

614
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,690
We tried so hard 
to lose this event.

615
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,880
Seriously, Intelligence, 
I tried to help you!

616
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,530
But this team sucks.

617
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,220
They deserve 
to lose after that.

618
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,760
That's all I can say.

619
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,040
- Spencer, you rocked. 
- It's hard.

620
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,530
- You ripped. 
- It's my fault.

621
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,100
No, it was a collective effort.

622
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,150
I don't blame 
anyone in particular.

623
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,750
I'm just disappointed that we lost.

624
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,950
I feel a little scammed 
to have to go to the council,

625
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,930
while I do 
very well in the trials.

626
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,900
It's my team 
that doesn't do it at all.

627
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,410
- Spencer, you nailed it. 
- Yeah, you did.

628
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,710
- It was so tight... 
- Really tight.

629
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,020
The worst thing about this tribe 
is that the girls have managed

630
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,670
to take a dominant position.

631
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,120
The problem is that by doing that, 
they put the tribe down.

632
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,280
J'Tia keeps screwing up 
in the trials.

633
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,620
It's beyond frustrating.

634
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,630
History does not preach 
in my favor.

635
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,170
I am an asset in the trials.

636
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,070
- You agree? 
- Yes.

637
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,280
I think J'Tia 
is quite the opposite.

638
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,010
If we keep losing 
and we're decimated,

639
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,450
- we're all in trouble. 
- Exactly.

640
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,830
The best thing for the tribe 
is to keep me.

641
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,390
I don't know if they 
comfort me before they take me out,

642
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,070
or if they are really trying to reinstate me.

643
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,490
Spencer can't 
be trusted.

644
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,020
Is there any logic 
in eliminating Spencer?

645
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,370
At this point, no.

646
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,260
If I could I would.

647
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,470
- But J'Tia can't do anything. 
- Light.

648
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,940
We can't win with her.

649
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,470
Yes, we will be eliminated one by one

650
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,750
if we don't have 
the best possible tribe.

651
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,640
Namely you, Spencer and me.

652
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,030
I'm happy with our decision, 
eliminating J'Tia makes sense.

653
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,840
If we have another event, 
we will have a tough guy with us.

654
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,890
Rather than someone 
known to have a propensity for failure.

655
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,560
I don't want to tell him 
he's safe.

656
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,240
Absolutely not.

657
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,370
I want us to play 
it like it's him.

658
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,790
And that J'Tia feels perfectly 
safe, to avoid any new...

659
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,920
I'm still mad about the rice.

660
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,390
- Let's go. 
- Let's go.

661
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,670
- It's hard, I like Spencer. 
- Light.

662
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,360
- Like us. 
- If we keep it,

663
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120
and there's a merge 
or something,

664
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,640
he will go with the men.

665
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,830
The important thing is trust.

666
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,510
At some point in the game, you have 
to be able to trust someone.

667
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,250
And I don't 
trust Spencer.

668
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,090
I have for me to be loyal.

669
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,750
But let's be honest. On the 6th day, 
I threw the rice on the fire.

670
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,030
Since then, I cling 
by the nails,

671
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,260
like the cat on the poster. 
"Hold on!"

672
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,260
It's me.

673
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,720
My best bet 
is that my wedding ring holds.

674
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,540
If tomorrow the tribes are mixed,

675
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,400
I trust you more than...

676
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,670
You have done a lot for me.

677
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,480
Whatever happens, if we're mixed up, 
I'm with you.

678
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,520
- Yes. 
- I believe you.

679
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,970
I believe you more than Spencer.

680
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,560
Initially, I was thinking 
of voting for J'Tia,

681
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,190
but I believe J'Tia loyal.

682
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,810
Thank you, ladies.

683
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:37,080
And you never know, Jeff might 
have a surprise in store for us.

684
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,850
In a game where you 
need someone loyal.

685
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,140
It is to be taken into account.

686
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,350
Are we in this game

687
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,530
to win races?

688
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,700
Or to go as far as 
possible with loyal people?

689
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:56,710
If we're mixed up, I guarantee you 
we can count on J'Tia.

690
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,140
The interesting with Tasha,

691
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,670
it is like a pendulum, 
here one moment, there the next.

692
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,350
It will change maybe 
five more times before the council.

693
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,370
I want her to leave.

694
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,980
But then 
I think for a moment:

695
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,050
for the long term, is this 
the wisest thing to do?

696
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,520
You make sense, 
I wanted to talk to you about it.

697
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,610
' Cause I might 
miss the mark, Kass.

698
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,760
Either way, it's a risk.

699
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,880
Tasha can't stop thinking about it.

700
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,890
I say: 
make a decision and let it flow!

701
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,860
But this is my life.

702
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,790
I always have to decide 
for others and live with them.

703
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,910
So we're gonna 
kick out J'Tia or Spencer.

704
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,490
I can live 
with both decisions.

705
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,170
For me, it's a gamble 
either way,

706
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,580
because I can't predict 
what will happen tomorrow.

707
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,730
J'Tia, what place 
do you occupy in this group,

708
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,160
in terms of responsibility 
for the defeats?

709
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,660
Honestly, today 
in the water I did my best.

710
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,520
It's a 
strange position for me.

711
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,190
Generally, in situations 
of great stress, I excel.

712
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,170
I don't think I have 
any physical shortcomings.

713
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,050
But swimming is not my thing.

714
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,900
Tasha, does that sound right to you,

715
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,900
that J'Tia was weak 
only once, namely today?

716
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,900
No, J'Tia was weak in 
most events, Jeff.

717
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,740
In the tests, we must 
find a role for him

718
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,790
which is as small as possible.

719
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,160
J'Tia, how does it feel 
to hear someone say

720
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,110
that if he voted for the 
weak link, it would be you?

721
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,660
She says I'm 
the weakest in trials,

722
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,660
not that I'm the weak link. 
Big difference.

723
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,120
Survivor isn't just about 
being stronger, it's also about being smarter.

724
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,090
You have to take that into account.

725
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,890
But you forget one aspect,

726
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,300
which is that you have to 
hold out long enough

727
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,790
to outlast the others.

728
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,750
And at this rate, none of you 
will be there in the end.

729
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,740
That's the real dilemma, 
isn't it, Tasha?

730
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,170
This is the decision to be made.

731
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,660
Do we keep the strongest 
to the trials, Spencer?

732
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,610
Him who kicked me out of the alliance 
with him and Garrett.

733
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,000
Or do we choose 
the one who has proven her loyalty?

734
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,540
Kass, what happens 
when you factor in

735
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,740
that J'Tia threw 
95% of your rice on the fire?

736
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:41,200
I view this incident 
as an emotional response,

737
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,990
not as a sign of disloyalty.

738
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,730
It's a hothead.

739
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,090
But I understand it, 
I was too.

740
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,800
Doesn't mean 
I'm not loyal,

741
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,870
just that I made 
bad decisions.

742
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:55,050
The problem is that these decisions 
can cost you a million.

743
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,770
Yes, tonight, I could make 
a very bad decision.

744
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,750
I feel the weight of it.

745
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,150
Spencer, how 
do you feel about all of this?

746
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,760
I believe the rice 
does not plead for it.

747
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,180
Maybe you give 
signs of loyalty,

748
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,290
but being unpredictable is 
as dangerous as being disloyal.

749
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,410
I won't make 
that kind of stupid mistake.

750
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,550
And I will move forward with this group.

751
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,520
You've said that before, so...

752
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,490
Yes, and I think...

753
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,670
I can't help it, I was the jerk 
on the wrong side of the vote the other time.

754
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,530
J'Tia and Spencer, are you aware 
that while you're chatting,

755
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,990
Kass and Tasha talk to each other?

756
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,610
I hear them whisper in front of me.

757
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,080
I know what we talked about 
before coming.

758
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,460
I hope the alliance will hold.

759
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,340
Spencer, they... 
Nod to each other.

760
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,710
That's crazy. As a 
viewer, I would love that,

761
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,000
but here, now, 
it's rather creepy.

762
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,310
Kass, you seem to be enjoying this.

763
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,710
If I was in front of my TV,

764
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,270
"Don't do anything stupid, Tash!"

765
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,320
"Don't do anything stupid, Kass!"

766
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,700
But what is stupid?

767
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,540
- That's the question. 
- That's the question now.

768
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,150
And you, Spencer? 
What do you feel?

769
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,830
Are you a big fan of the show?

770
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,580
and you haven't really had 
a chance to actually play.

771
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,170
It's infuriating.

772
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,150
And at this point, I'm 
ready to do anything to avoid it.

773
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,160
Tash doesn't even listen to you.

774
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,600
She looks at Kass

775
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,040
and they seek the decision.

776
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,390
It is decided at this moment.

777
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,500
I mean I'm 
loyal to you two.

778
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,700
I want to help you 
win events.

779
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,930
All I ask 
is an opportunity.

780
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,560
Well, it's time to vote. 
Kass, it's up to you.

781
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,840
I've never been 
so nervous in my life.

782
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,210
I know it's you or me.

783
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,360
So there is nothing to think about.

784
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,400
I've been on probation since 
I threw the rice away.

785
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,200
I hope it's you and not me.

786
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,390
I will count the votes.

787
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,110
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

788
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,110
now is the time to do it.

789
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,690
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

790
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,620
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

791
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,770
I will read the votes.

792
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,420
First vote.

793
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,020
J'Tia.

794
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,550
I Tia. 
Two J'Tia votes, one Spencer vote.

795
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,880
One vote remains.

796
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,350
Fourth person eliminated 
from Survivor Cagayan.

797
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,350
J'Tia.

798
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,650
Bring me your torch.

799
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,570
Good luck to you.

800
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,910
- Thanks. 
- Thanks.

801
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,630
J'Tia, the tribe has spoken.

802
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,950
It's time to go.

803
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,130
I will prove 
to you that you have done well.

804
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,810
I say.

805
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,910
- I am with you 100%. 
- I say.

806
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,180
With all the ups and downs 
of this tribe,

807
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,110
the only constant is 
that you remain unpredictable.

808
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,450
Let's hope this new 
configuration brings you stability,

809
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,450
because you need it.

810
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,040
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

811
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,500
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

812
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,710
In the next episode of Survivor...

813
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,840
It was really intense.

814
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,920
The Intelligence tribe 
is on the verge of extinction.

815
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,530
Our way of playing is ridiculous.

816
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,110
We are not "Intelligence", 
we are "Imbecility".

817
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,500
But a turnaround 
revives the game.

818
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,940
Throw away your bandanas.

819
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,520
Intelligence, Muscle 
and Beauty no longer exist.

820
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm not surprised 
they eliminated me.

821
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,050
I threw away all the rice 
and was weak in the trials.

822
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,370
So yes, these are good 
reasons to eliminate me.

823
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,580
What to say?

824
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,530
I am shared. 
I wish them good luck,

825
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,330
and at the same time I hope 
they will starve.

826
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,250
But that's life.

827
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,250
You live, you learn 
from your mistakes, you grow.

828
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,470
I'll just grow 
outside of the game.
