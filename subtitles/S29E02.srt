HE DOESN'T WANT THE GUYS TO KNOW

92
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:23,328
THAT ME AND HIM ARE ALIGNED.

WAY BUT IT WAS ALSO SKETCHY AND

95
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,499
SCARY THAT HE DIDN'T TELL ME

96
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,668
BEFORE HE WAS GOING TO WRITE MY

97
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,753

THAT WAS TOO INTENSE FOR ME.

113
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,586
>> WE HAVE JON AND WE HAVE DREW

114
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,381

SAYING?

123

WHICH FOR ME IS GOOD BECAUSE I

124
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,560
KNOW ALL THE GIRLS CAN'T STAND

125
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:29,894

143
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,129
LOSING THAT IS NOT GOOD.

144
00:04:56,212 --> 00:05:00,091
WELL, GREAT.

PROBABLY GOING TO DO A LOT TO

155
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,610
MAKE UP FOR ME.

156
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,864

IS THAT ACCEPTED BY EVERYONE?

160
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,453
I HAVE NO IDEA UPON.

161
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,705
I MEAN, I'M VERY NERVOUS ABOUT

00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,540
IT, VERY NERVOUS ABOUT IT.

00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,383
NOT-TRADITIONAL SITUATION THAT

378
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,718
WE'D LIKE TO PROPOSE TO YOU.

379
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,052
>> Jeff: OKAY.

380
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,095
>> OUR TRIBE SEEMS TO HAVE

381
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,306
MISPLACED OUR FLINT.

382
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,891
AND SO WE WERE WONDERING IF WE

383
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,850
COULD POTENTIALLY BARTER WITH

384
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,061
YOU AND TAKE THE FISHING

385
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,312
EQUIPMENT BUT TRADE YOU THE

386
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:38,943
BEANS FOR OUR FLINT.

387
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,028
>> Jeff: FIRST, LET ME

388
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,737
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.

389
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,323
SO THE TRIBE WITH TWO FIREMEN,

390
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,033
KEITH AND JEREMY, YOU'VE LOST

391
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:46,283
IT.

392
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,535
>> IT'S GONE, JEFF.

393
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,911
>> Jeff: SO YOU WANT TO MAKE A

394
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,538
TRADE BUT YOU WANT TO KEEP THE

395
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,997
FISHING GEAR AND YOU WANT TO

396
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,666
TRADE THE BEANS.

397
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,376
WALK ME THROUGH THIS FROM A

398
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:55,876
NEGOTIATION STANDPOINT.

399
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,002
YOU'RE THE ONES WHO NEED TO MAKE

400
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:57,670
THE DEAL.

401
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,713
MY LIFE IS FINE.

402
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,090
SO YOU COME IN, SURVEY THE

403
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,217
SCENE, SEE WHAT THE REWARD IS,

404
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,678
AND THEN OFFER ME THE THING OF

405
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,012
LEAST VALUE, POSSIBLY A HALF A

406
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,349
BAG OF BEANS AT THIS POINT, I'M

407
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:10,599
GUESSING.

408
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,434
>> A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT.

409
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,019
>> JEFF, IF YOU DON'T ASK, YOU

410
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:14,436
DON'T KNOW.

411
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,479
>> IT'S ALMOST FULL.

412
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,105
>> Jeff: A BETTER NEGOTIATION

413
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,565
WOULD HAVE BEEN TO WALK IN AT

414
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,650
THE TOP OF THE CHALLENGE SAY,

415
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,735
"CAN WE TRADE OUR BEANS?"

416
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,069
STRAIGHT UP.

417
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,862
YOU CAME IN TO SEE IF YOU COULD

418
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,155
WIN, AND THEN LEVERAGED THAT.

419
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,491
AND THAT DOESN'T WORK ON

420
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,158
"SURVIVOR."

421
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,994
I GOT ONE OFFER FOR YOU IF YOU

422
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,579
WANT TO MAKE IT, AND THAT IS YOU

423
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,913
GIVE UP ALL THIS FISHING GEAR

424
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:33,914
FOR A NEW FLINT.

425
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,500
>> NO, WE'LL JUST KEEP

426
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,418
COLLECTING FIREWOOD.

427
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,127
>> Jeff: NOW I KNOW WHEN YOU

428
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,919
DON'T HAVE A FLINT, WHEN IT

429
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,338
RAINS AND IT WILL AND YOUR FIRE

430
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,090
GOES OUT, AND NOW YOU NEED TO

431
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,676
MAKE A TRADE, THE PAIN WILL BE

432
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,135
MUCH TOUGHER.

433
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,386
THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY NOW TO

434
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,053
SEIZE IT IF YOU WANT IT, BECAUSE

435
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,639
I PROMISE YOU TO GET A FLIPT

436
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,223
LATER WILL COST YOU MORE THAN

437
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:51,557
FISHING GEAR.

438
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,101
>> WE'LL KEEP THE FIRE GOING.

439
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,060
>> I'LL EAT RAW FISH.

440
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,187
>> NO, WE CAN'T SURVIVE WITHOUT

441
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:57,396
FIRE.

442
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,647
>> NO, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE

443
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:58,981
FIRE GOING.

444
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,315
>> YOU GUYS --

445
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,065
>> Jeff: WHAT'S THE DECISION.

446
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,984
>> WE GOT DPAWRNTED--

447
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,403
>> WE'LL TAKE THE FLINT.

448
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,321
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'LL

449
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,865
LEAVE THE FISHING GEAR BEHIND.

450
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,658
YOU'LL HAVE A NEW FLINT WAITING

451
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,618
FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

452
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,745
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.

453
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,371
>> Jeff: COYOPA, I GOT NOTHING

454
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,164
FOR YOU.

455
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,206
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

456
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:16,999
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

457
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,792
HUNAHPU, GRAB YOUR STUFF AND

458
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,585
HEAD OUT.

459
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,462
>> CATCHING SOME FISH WOULD HAVE

460
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,505
BEEN JUST HEAVENLY.

461
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,506
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DIDN'T GET IT

462
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,591
BECAUSE ALL WE DID WAS TRADE IT

463
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,383
FOR FLINT.

464
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,760
LOSING THE FLINT WAS A PRETTY

465
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,260
BIG MISTAKE.

466
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,597
IT WAS MY FAULT WE WASTED OUR

467
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,389
CHANCE AT FISHING GEAR.

468
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,030
>> YAY!

469
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:48,739
FLINT!

470
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,032
>> LET'S NAIL IT TO A TREE.

471
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,326
>> I KNOW, RIGHT?

472
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,202
>> GOOD JOB, JULIE.

473
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,995
>> THANK YOU.

474
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,289
>> IT WAS AWESOME, AWESOME,

475
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:03,420
AWESOME.

476
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,715
>> I LITERALLY HAVEN'T CRIED

477
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:06,924
FOREVER.

478
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,384
>> IT'S PENT UP PUP NEED TO GET

479
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:08,926
IT OUT.

480
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,469
>> YOU KNOW ALL THE STUFF WE'VE

481
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,512
BEEN GOING THROUGH.

482
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,638
YOU CAN LET IT ALL OUT NOW.

483
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,223
>> I WOULD HAVE SAID I THINK

484
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,140
THERE'S NO OTHER BOND BESIDES A

485
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,560
MOM AND A DAUGHTER, BUT MAN,

486
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,478
TWINS.

487
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,146
WOO"P" AND IT'S REALLY PRETTY

488
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,064
TOUCHING TO SEE A TOUGH GIRL

489
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:22,231
CRY.

490
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,066
I WANT TO HELP HER.

491
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:30,322
SHE'S AS BIG AND BAD ASS AS YOU

492
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,199
ARE YOU SHE'S PERFECTLY FINE.

493
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,326
>> YOU CAN REMIND YOURSELF IT'S

494
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,453
A GAME BUT IT'S STILL YOUR

495
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:36,704
FAMILY.

496
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,038
IF IT WAS YOUR DUDE, YOU WOULD

497
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:38,497
PROBABLY BE ALL RIGHT.

498
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,249
BUT IT'S YOUR SISTER.

499
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,501
>> NADIYA GOT VOTED OFF, AND

500
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,377
SHE'S PROBABLY FINE.

501
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,753
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE NOT

502
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,003
TOGETHER.

503
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:45,671
THAT'S THE HARD PART.

504
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,964
NOW IT'S REALLY GOOD MOTIVATION

505
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,757
FOR ME TO KEEP MY HEAD IN THE

506
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,134
GAME AND JUST PLAY HARD SO THAT

507
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,760
I CAN JUST AT LEAST GO AS FAR AS

508
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:59,101
I CAN.

509
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,272
>> I CAN TOTALLY REMEMBER SEEING

510
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,982
ROCKER, ATLANTA BRAVES, ON THE

511
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:05,441
BACK OF THEIR JERSEYS.

512
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,150
>> WHAT'S HIS LAST NAME?

513
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,527
>> ROCKER.

514
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,236
THAT'S MY POINT.

515
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,195
>> JOHN ROCKER?

516
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,656
>> JOHN ROCKER.

517
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,992
>> WAS HE THE GUY THAT GOT RAN

518
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:15,909
OUT OF THE LEAGUE?

519
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,994
>> THE WHAT?

520
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,329
>> I'M NOT SURE BUT THERE WAS A

521
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,623
PITCHER FOR ATLANTA THAT GAVE AN

522
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,624
INTERVIEW, AND HE LET EVERYBODY

523
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,043
KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE

524
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,503
ETHNIC MAKEUP OF THE PEOPLE THAT

525
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,088
RIDE THE SUBWAYS IN NEW YORK.

526
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,173
HE GOT OFSRACIZED FOR BASEBALL

527
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,299
JUST ABOUT FOR IT.

528
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,176
>> WELL, MAYBE HE'S CHANGED.

529
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,845
>> JUST BECAUSE JOHN DOES THINGS

530
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,722
I DON'T LIKE, DOESN'T MEAN I

531
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,098
DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH HIM

532
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:38,682
BECAUSE I THINK THAT MAKES HIM

533
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,477
EVEN MORE OF AN ASSET TO BE USED

534
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,687
BECAUSE HE'S PISSING OFF SO MANY

535
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,023
PEOPLE ALREADY THAT, YES, I WANT

536
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,399
HIM ON MY TIME TEAM!

537
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,110
>> JOHN AND JEREMY ON EXILE.

538
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:57,868
>> BETTER BE A BIG DAMN ISLAND.

539
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:08,086
>> EXILED IS NOT A HAPPY PLACE.

540
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,421
IT'S DESOLATE.

541
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,088
IT'S DRY.

542
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,673
THERE ARE NO COCONUTS.

543
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,257
IT IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE.

544
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,385
PLUS THE ICING ON TOP IS NOW I'M

545
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,804
STUCK OUT HERE WITH JOHN ROCKY.

546
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,763
I KNOW WHO HE IS.

547
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,388
HE USED TO PITCH FOR THE BRAVES

548
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:18,764
AND EVERYTHING.

549
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,142
>> YOU MUST EACH CHOOSE AN URN.

550
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,269
HE WAS PLAGUING AGAIN THE NEW

551
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,229
YORK METS, AND TALKING ABOUT

552
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,273
BLACK PEOPLE AND HOMOSEXUALS AND

553
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,858
ALL THIS OTHER STUFF.

554
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,610
I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT HE

555
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,320
SAID BUT I REMEMBER HE SAID

556
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,363
RACIST THINGS.

557
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:38,742
>> BUPKUS.

558
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,076
IT'S NOTHING.

559
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,370
>> IT IS UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU

560
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,955
SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH

561
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,789

00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,333
AN IDOL, AND JACLYN'S MY ONE AND

937
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,083
ONLY ALLIANCE.

938
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:54,918
BUT I'M PREPARED TO MAKE BIG

939
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,629
MOVES TO MAKE SURE THEY STAY IN

940
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,923
THIS GAME.

941
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,821
IT WAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST

942
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,948
THINGS I EVER HAD TO WATCH.

943
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,241
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN PROUDER

944
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,576
THAN ANYBODY IN MY LIFE THAN

945
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:28,785
KELLEY.

946
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,661
WELL, JACLYN?

947
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,746
>> I CURRENTLY HATE HERE.

948
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,957
BUT IT'S JUST IN THE MOAPT.

949
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,042
I'M SURE I'LL GET OVER IT.

950
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,252
>> SHE NEVER QUIT.

951
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,002
SHE WAS DOWN, HER TRIBE WAS

952
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:42,006
DOWN, AND SHE GAVE HER TRIBE THE

953
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,257
WIN.

954
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,636
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS THE WRONG

955
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:46,844
TRIBE.

956
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,012
>> IT WAS A PLEASURE HANGING OUT

957
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,472
WITH JEREMY.

958
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,141
>> YOU PROBABLY GOT A CLUE.

959
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:52,475
>> JEREMY DID.

960
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,852
>> DID HE SHARE IT WITH YOU.

961
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,103
>> YES.

962
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,189
>> I FOUND ONE ON THE ISLAND

963
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:58,398
HERE.

964
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:02,110
>> BASICALLY, I'M SAVING ME AND

965
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:02,318
JACLYN.

966
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,529
RIGHT NOW, I AM IN A TIGHT

967
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,989
SITUATION BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

968
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:06,906
AN IDOL.

969
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,908
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

970
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,994
I AM JUST LYING.

971
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,870
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

972
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,913
I HAVE TO PLAY BIG.

973
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,999
OR I'M GOING HOME.

974
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,960
SO SAVE YOURSELF AND FIND IT.

975
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,421
>> VAL'S CLAIMING TO HAVE TWO

976
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,088
IDOLS AND I'VE SEEN THE CLUE.

977
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,591
I THINK AT THIS POINT, I NEED TO

978
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,925
GET OFF MY ASS, AND START

979
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,885
LOOKING FOR IDOLS.

980
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,430
THE CLUE I GOT SAID, "DIG, WEL,

981
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,140
NORTH, 7."

982
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,101
I'M THINKING WELL, SEVEN PACES

983
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,978
NORTH, DIG.

984
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,646
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A SHOT.

985
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,732
SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND.

986
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,026
HOPE SOMETHING GOOD TURNS UP.

987
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:50,825
RIGHT NOW, ALL I'VE GOT IS ROCKS

988
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:51,367
ROCKS.

989
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,918
AND BINGO, BOYS.

990
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,255
HERE IS WHAT JOHNNY ROCK HAS

991
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,967
BEEN LOOKING FOR.

992
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,886
I FOUND AT LEAST AN EXTRA THREE

993
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,804
DAYS IN THE GAME.

994
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,058
WEAR IT WITH PRIDE.

995
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,976
TEND TO BE THE ATHLETE TYPES

996
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,977
ALWAYS MAKE IT RIGHT BEFORE THE

997
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,520
MERGE AND THEY'RE GONE, SO I

998
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,814
WOULD LOVE TO SAVE THIS ABOUT

999
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,859
THE FOURTH, FIFTH COUNCIL, PLAY

1000
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,694
IT AND TAKE MYSELF TO THE MERGE

1001
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,073
BUT THIS HAS BOUGHT ME SOME

1002
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:30,323
PRATIME.

1003
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,700
NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

1004
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,787
TO PROTECT VAL.

1005
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,757
>> IF SHE DOES HAVE TWO, YEAH,

1006
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,133
THEN ONE OF US 5 GUYS IS GOING

1007
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,220
HOME, SO THE ONLY OTHER WAY

1008
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,805
AROUND THAT AND NOT LETTING THEM

1009
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,725
THAN THREE VOTES ARE GOING FOR

1010
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:04,315
BAYLOR.

1011
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,246
>> ALL RIGHT.

1012
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,832
>> I DID MAKE A PROMISE TO

1013
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,500
JEREMY, IF I WANT TO ENSURE

1014
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,209
JULIE'S SAFETY, I HAVE TO ENSURE

1015
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,085
VAL'S SAFETY.

1016
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,547
SO SHE PLAYS HER IDOL, TONIGHT,

1017
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,548
SHE SHOULD BE FINE.

1018
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,173
PLAY THAT IDOL.

1019
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,802
>> I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE AN

1020
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,053
OSCAR-WINNING MOMENT.

1021
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,097
I DON'T HAVE THE IDOL.

1022
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,516
BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

1023
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,226
BECAUSE THREE OF THEM VOTE

1024
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,186
BAYLOR, AND JACKIE AND I VOTE

1025
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,105
BAYLOR, THAT'S FIVE AGAINST

1026
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:44,313
BAYLOR.

1027
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,943
I KNOW ME AND JACLYN ARE SAFE.

1028
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:05,334
♪ ♪ ♪

1029
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,089
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN JOHN AND VAL

1030
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,132
WALKED OFF TOGETHER.

1031
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,009
THEY'VE NEVER WALKED OFF

1032
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:13,301
TOGETHER.

1033
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:18,222
LIKE, THEY-- JUST THOSE TWO?

1034
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,016
I KIND OF WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S

1035
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,518
GOING ON ABOUT THAT, AND I DON'T

1036
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:28,024
THINK HE'S BEING HONEST WITH ME.

1037
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,192
SPLITTING A VOTE IS DEFINITELY

1038
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,778
RISKY AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME

1039
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,361
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME PEOPLE

1040
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,280
ON OUR TEAM THAT YOU WONDER

1041
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,907
ABOUT SOMETIMES.

1042
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,242
SO TONIGHT, WHAT ENDS UP COMING

1043
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,869
DOWN TO IS WHAT DO I THINK IS

1044
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:54,300
GOING TO GET ME TO THE TOP.

1045
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,270
>> Jeff: DALE, YOU'RE 0 FOR 4

1046
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,439
IN THIS GAME.

1047
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,275
>> WELL, I THINK WE MADE

1048
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,402
MISTAKES STRATEGIZING IF ARE THE

1049
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,529
CHALLENGE TODAY.

1050
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,947
EXCEPT FOR BAYLOR AND HER MOM,

1051
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,448
EVERY TIME LOVED ONE AND LOVED

1052
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,408
ONE WENT HEAD TO HEAD, WE LOST.

1053
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,285
I THINK IT'S A PRIDE THING.

1054
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,286
I CAME HERE TO FIGHT MY FAMILY

1055
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:22,537
MEMBER.

1056
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,205
>> IT WAS DEFINITELY A PRIDE

1057
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,956
THING FOR ME.

1058
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,332
>> HE WALKED RIGHT UP AND CAME

1059
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,875
UP ON THE SHORT END.

1060
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,710
>> Jeff: SO THERE'S A LOT MORE

1061
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,546
STRATEGY WITH THIS LOVED ONE

1062
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,172
THING THAN IT APPEARED AT FIRST.

1063
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,215
>> I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

1064
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,552
DOING THAT WITH DREW FOR A LONG

1065
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:37,718
TIME.

1066
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,261
I DIDN'T COME OUT ON TOP.

1067
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,387
IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT THE

1068
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,305
SMARTEST MOVE FOR ME TO GO UP

1069
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,849
AGAINST DREW BUT THIS ISN'T THE

1070
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,391
FIRST TIME WE'VE FAILED TO

1071
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,893
DECIDE BEFORE WE JUST THROW OUR

1072
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,310
MATCH-UP OUT THERE.

1073
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,855
>> AT SOME POINT, JEFF, IT'S

1074
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,273
GOING TO GEL AND CLICK AND WE'LL

1075
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:54,610
BE RIGHT BACK THERE MENTALLY AND

1076
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:54,902
PHYSICALLY.

1077
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,486
>> Jeff: JOSH, THAT WORKS IF

1078
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,279
TIME IS NOT AN ISSUE.

1079
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,238
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

1080
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,740
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BROADWAY

1081
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,366
SHOW THAT STARTS THEIR PREVIEWS

1082
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,451
AND THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD A

1083
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,202
GREAT SHOW AND ALL OF A SENT

1084
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,996
AUDIENCES HATE IT.

1085
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,914
SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY STOP AND

1086
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,874
REWORK THE SHOW.

1087
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,292
THEY TAKE OUT SONGS, THEY PUT

1088
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,710
OTHER THINGS IN AND THEN THEY DO

1089
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,044
IT AGAIN AND HAVE AN OPENING

1090
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,212
NIGHT WITH ALL THE CHANGES AND

1091
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:13,588
COME OUT STRONG.

1092
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,464
SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME

1093
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,757
CHANGES TO MAKE US STRONGER

1094
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,675
COMING OUT.

1095
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,343
>> Jeff: SO HOW TO YOU DO

1096
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:19,594
THAT, VAL?

1097
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,137
>> WELL, JEFF, I THINK IT GOES

1098
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,930
BACK TO JUST EVEN HOW CAMP IS.

1099
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,473
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE PEOPLE IN CAMP

1100
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,391
THAT TRY TO PLAY BOTH SIDES OF

1101
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,309
THIS GAME.

1102
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,269
>> Jeff: WHICH IS WHO?

1103
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,522
>> BAYLOR.

1104
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,982
>> Jeff: SO, BAYLOR, NOW

1105
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:33,774
YOU'RE UNDER THE BUS.

1106
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,569
>> YEAH, I FEEL LIKE VAL'S BEEN

1107
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,278
OUT FOR ME FROM THE MOMENT SHE

1108
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,113
WALKED ON THE ISLAND.

1109
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:39,739
SHE BROUGHT THE GIRLS TOGETHER.

1110
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,406
WE HAD A DISCUSSION.

1111
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,533
>> AND CHOSE TO GO WITH THE GUYS

1112
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:42,867
AT THAT POINT.

1113
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,619
>> YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING WITH

1114
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,036
US.

1115
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,411
>> WELL...

1116
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,413
>> Jeff: WHO IS "US" JACLYN?

1117
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,750
>> ME, VAL, NADIYA, AND BAYLOR.

1118
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,834
AND THEN YOU FLIPPED.

1119
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,502
>> AND THEN YOU TOLD US TO VOTE

1120
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,004
FOR DALE BECAUSE I HADN'T BEEN

1121
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:55,212
THERE.

1122
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,757
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY, AND THE

1123
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,633
ONLY PEOPLE THAT WERE TALKING TO

1124
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,383
ME WERE THE GIRLS.

1125
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,427
>> THAT WASN'T ME SAYING, "LET'S

1126
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,678
VOTE DALE."

1127
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,846
>> THAT EXACTLY WAS.

1128
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,640
YOU TOLD ME TO VOTE DALE.

1129
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,350
STRAIGHT UP, YOU TOLD ME TO VOTE

1130
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,225
DALE RIGHT AT CAMP.

1131
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:08,476
>> WOW.

1132
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,352
>> WOW IS RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU

1133
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:09,518
DID.

1134
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,897
OWN IT.

1135
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,857
>> Jeff: WES, THERE IS CLEARLY

1136
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,441
TENSION IN THIS TRIBE.

1137
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,026
>> UH-HUH.

1138
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,194
>> Jeff: AND WHEN THERE'S

1139
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:18,819
TENSION, AS VAL SAID, IT'S HARD

1140
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,571
TO PERFORM AT YOUR BEST.

1141
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,366
>> SHE SAYS SHE HAS AN IDOL.

1142
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,325
THAT'S THE MAIN REASON RIGHT

1143
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:24,492
THERE.

1144
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,118
>> I HEARD TWO.

1145
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,371
>> AND I HEARD TWO, TOO.

1146
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,622
>> YOU HEARD TWO WHAT?

1147
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,540
>> I HEARD SHE HAD TWO IDOLS.

1148
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,792
>> Jeff: WES WHAT, IS THE

1149
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,294
IMPACT OF VAL SAYING SHE HAS TWO

1150
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:35,503
IDOLS?

1151
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,297
>> VOTE FOR HER, DRAW WITHIN

1152
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:38,464
OUT.

1153
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,924
>> Jeff: VAL, WILL YOU BE

1154
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,550
SURPRISED IF YOU GET VOTES

1155
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,009
TONIGHT?

1156
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:42,176
>> NO.

1157
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,678
>> Jeff: BAYLOR, WOULD YOU BE

1158
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,096
SURPRISED IF YOU GOT VOTES?

1159
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,430
>> NOW, I'M NOT, BUT IT WOULD BE

1160
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,515
A SHAME TO SEE A LOT OF FLIPPING

1161
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,351
HAPPENING NOW JUST BECAUSE OF

1162
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:55,022
SOME-- SOME CRAZY TALK.

1163
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,023
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1164
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,817
TO VOTE.

1165
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:13,582
ALEC, YOU'RE UP.

1166
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,549
>> YOU'RE AS SWEET AS YOU CAN

1167
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,634
BE, BUT YOU GOTTA GO.

1168
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,599
>> I JUST WANT TO SEE THAT IDOL,

1169
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:46,032
GIRL.

1170
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,909
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1171
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,160
VOTES.

1172
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,419
ALL RIGHT, IF ANYBODY HAS A

1173
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,254
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

1174
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:01,547
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE

1175
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:09,513
THE TIME TO DO SO.

1176
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,515
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1177
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,433
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1178
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,642
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1179
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,062
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1180
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:16,353
IMMEDIATELY.

1181
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,273
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1182
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:26,113

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REVOTE.

00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,023
HERE'S HOW IT WILL WORK.

1200
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,567
YOU CAN ONLY VOTE FOR VAL OR

00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,672
AND I TOLD YOU WHAT WAS GOING TO

1207
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:24,880

1208
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,632
YOU MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A LIAR TO

1209
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:39,770
YOUR HUSBAND.

1210
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,106

SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF

"BLOOD VERSUS WATER."

1223
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:14,847
VAL.

1224
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:26,650
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1225
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:31,530
VAL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1226
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:41,832
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1227
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:42,917
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY

1228
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,336
THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU.

1229
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,712
HAVEN'T WON A CHALLENGE, LOST

1230
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,671
TWO TRIBE MEMBERS.

1231
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,672
SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE QUICKLY

1232
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,551
OR ONE BY ONE YOU WILL EACH BE

1233
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,136
OUT OF THIS GAME.

1234
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:54,762
GRAB YOUR STIFF, HEAD BACK TO

1235
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:54,929
CAMP.

1236
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,640
GOOD NIGHT.

1237
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,027
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1238
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,862
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1239
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,116
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1240
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,742
"SURVIVOR":

1241
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,744
>> YOU ALL DON'T KNOW WHO JOHN

1242
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,411
ROCKER IS.

1243
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:19,787
I KNOW WHO HE IS.

1244
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,039
>> Jeff: JOHN ROCKER'S PAST IS

1245
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:22,581
FINALLY EXPOSED.

1246
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,791
>> HE SAID A WHOLE BUNCH OF

1247
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,124
RACIST STUFF.

1248
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,836
>> HE'S A BIGOT.

1249
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,213
>> Jeff: AND SO HAD HIS

1250
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:29,630
TEMPER.

1251
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,006
>> YOU'RE A BAD SPORT.

1252
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,799
>> TAKE DOWN ALL THE STUFF AND

1253
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,091
WE'LL FIGHT.

1254
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:40,349
>> JOHN, JOHN, STOP!

1255
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,309
>> I FEEL LIKE I PLAYED BIG,

1256
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,644
MADE BIG MOVES, CONSIDERING THAT

1257
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,896
I WASN'T WITH THE TRIBE FOR TWO

1258
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,105
DAYS.

1259
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:46,855
IT WORKED FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

1260
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:47,731
I WISH IT WOULD HAVE WORKED FOR

1261
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,774
LONGER, BUT I'M HAPPY WITH WHAT

1262
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,650
I DID.

1263
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,735
AND I THINK JEREMY SEEING ME

1264
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,820
GONE WILL BE A SHOCK TO HIM

1265
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,696
INITIALLY, BUT I THINK IT WILL

1266
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,282
MAKE HIM GO HARDER IN HIS GAME.

1267
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,700
AND I THINK IT WILL INSPIRE HIM.

1268
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,785
SO I'M HAPPY WITH THAT.
