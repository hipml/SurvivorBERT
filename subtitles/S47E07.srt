1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,426
My god! Yeah!

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,240
Hey, hey, hey, let's go!

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,426
<i>Previously on survivor</i>

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,766
I'm just letting you know.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,976
- Thank you for letting me know.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,146
<i>I think I might be a little bit</i>

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,790
of a mastermind right now, you know?

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,596
<i>Rome just talks, talks, talks,</i>

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,930
and it's crap, crap, crap.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,480
Rome is now, in case
anybody wants to know,

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,906
my number one hit.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,550
<i>First opportunity, Rome's outie.</i>

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,426
Everybody here would be very happy

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,356
voting Rome tonight.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,240
I would love it if there
was a second name.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,900
- Yeah.
- Are you guys okay with Andy?

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,736
If it's Andy, it's Andy.

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,830
Yeah.

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,690
Andy.

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,660
Sixth person voted out
of survivor 47: Rome.

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,170
The tribe has spoken.

22
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,356
Yes, congrats.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,550
Yay.

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,216
<i>Right now, I am feeling</i>

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,906
so, so, so, so good about
what happened at tribal council.

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,836
<i>Rome, my biggest source</i>

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,426
<i>of paranoia and stress in this game,</i>

28
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,526
<i>was collectively voted out.</i>

29
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,526
<i>And not only is the amulet advantage</i>

30
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,076
out of my hands.

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,116
It was also played on me

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,666
so that I didn't even have
a chance of going home.

33
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,690
- Congrats. All right?
- Congrats.

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,860
<i>But beyond that, sol</i>

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,806
is the only known person
who wrote Andy's name down,

36
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,620
<i>and he needs to do some
damage control, because</i>

37
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,520
obviously, Andy's
gonna be upset with that.

38
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,046
I did not want to do that.

39
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,620
I promise you with all my heart,

40
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,356
- I did not want to do that, okay?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,766
I genuinely believed Rome had an idol.

42
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,076
- Right.
- I really did.

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,426
- Okay?
- Yes.

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,116
And if he puts my name down...

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,426
- And everyone is on Rome...
- Yeah. - I'm gone.

46
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,240
Okay, so you're very confident - yeah.

47
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,004
That he has an idol
and he's gonna play it.

48
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:28,326
Right.

49
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,766
That means you're very confident
that you're sending me home.

50
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,496
Well... Of everyone on god's green earth,

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,620
- right.
- You chose me.

52
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,860
Right.

53
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,100
- Why?
- Okay.

54
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,356
<i>Me voting for Andy
gives me some work to do.</i>

55
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,736
<i>I knew there was a chance
that Andy would still be here,</i>

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,666
<i>but I had to protect myself, so now</i>

57
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,310
I know I have to give up some things

58
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,550
to earn his trust back, and,
I have no problem with that.

59
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,356
I didn't want to do it, Andy,

60
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,216
but they were all coming back to me,

61
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,146
and were like, "hey, Rome wants you."

62
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,420
I was like, "okay, fine, but
we have to have a backup."

63
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,170
Okay. Okay.

64
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,420
- So that's when I was like...
- Who-who, exactly?

65
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,550
It was Sam.

66
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,806
<i>Sam is the one who said</i>

67
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,806
that you're the backup, okay?

68
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,526
<i>I did a lot of work to get
out of gato alive and have</i>

69
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,186
a decently strong alliance
with Sam and Sierra,

70
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,216
but I feel like,

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,906
as time has gone on,
little things have started

72
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,170
<i>to not add up in terms of how
they're moving in this game.</i>

73
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,456
<i>And when sol tells me
that they are using me</i>

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,146
<i>as a sacrificial lamb, I wasn't shocked.</i>

75
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,620
<i>I wasn't that surprised,
but I was, you know, sort of</i>

76
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,596
woken up, and things
became very clear to me.

77
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,946
Based off what you're telling me, - yeah.

78
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,900
I need significant help from real allies.

79
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,930
So, I want some protection
from this in the future.

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,930
And what I want is an alliance - yeah.

81
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,596
Where people are not
gonna be throwing my name

82
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,660
as a backup option.

83
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,396
- Do you want to be a part of that?
- Absolutely.

84
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,550
- You...
- The next, like, three, four moves,

85
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,906
you need to make are just...
Need to be exactly how I expect.

86
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,046
- Okay, man.
- And we get rid of gata.

87
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,456
You got it, man. My man.

88
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,216
<i>After this vote, I realize</i>

89
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,596
if I'm gonna survive the
second half of this game, like,

90
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,046
<i>I need to flip the switch.</i>

91
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,480
<i>I need to take control
and have authorship</i>

92
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,666
<i>over how the rest of this
game is gonna go for me.</i>

93
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,480
<i>And right now, that
means I should just gun</i>

94
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,496
<i>for my gata tribe mates, because</i>

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,496
if they're gonna come for me,

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,930
<i>I need to get them first.</i>

97
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,930
<i>Whatever you need, Sierra.</i>

98
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,496
<i>Do you want my shot in the dark?</i>

99
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,836
<i>I can give you my shot in the dark.</i>

100
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,596
I mean, I would love that.

101
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,076
<i>I'm so thankful for you.</i>

102
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,396
- Yeah, man. I got you.
- Let's go.

103
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,070
- You know I got you.
- Yeah, I do.

104
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,216
It was Sam.

105
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,520
<i>Sam is the one who said
that you're the backup.</i>

106
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,116
<i>Last night really got my head spinning</i>

107
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,116
<i>because I really feel like I invested</i>

108
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,146
<i>in those relationships
with Sam and Sierra</i>

109
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,550
<i>on the early days of gata.</i>

110
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,426
<i>But I'm realizing that I am a third wheel</i>

111
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,100
<i>and ultimately, very expendable.</i>

112
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,046
<i>Not even just at the
endgame, but even now.</i>

113
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,146
<i>And so, I'm reevaluating my game</i>

114
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,070
<i>coming into this merged tribe.</i>

115
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,456
<i>I feel like I have an opportunity</i>

116
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,216
<i>to find, really, sort of my people</i>

117
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,596
<i>that I can really roll with for
the long term in this game.</i>

118
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,620
<i>And, long story short.</i>

119
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,216
I want to swing away from gata.

120
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,216
<i>Did you have an okay sleep?</i>

121
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,310
I slept okay.

122
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,666
Tribal council was interesting, obviously.

123
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,930
I know.

124
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,426
My god. How are you feeling?

125
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,806
I really just need to know
how to go forward, like...

126
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,666
Last night, my number one
went home, and I'm, like

127
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,766
I'm not taking a second to mourn it.

128
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,596
<i>"All I'm thinking is," okay,</i>

129
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,116
<i>I'm in the market for a new ally,"</i>

130
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,046
<i>and top of my list is Andy.</i>

131
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,146
We need to find a way to, like,

132
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,806
not just be the singles, you know,

133
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,666
- because the singles, no one's afraid of.
- Yes.

134
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,526
- Yeah, let's do something about it.
- Yeah.

135
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,318
Like, let's take the
game into our own hands.

136
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:20,876
I love that.

137
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,550
After the first immunity challenge,

138
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,806
Andy had what I can only describe

139
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,240
as a moment of, like,
true, raw, vulnerable panic.

140
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,076
<i>But I really felt for him in that moment,</i>

141
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,596
<i>and he's still here.</i>

142
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,046
<i>I think, probably, because
people were using him</i>

143
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,170
<i>to further their agendas,
but now he has an agenda</i>

144
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,240
<i>and I have an agenda, and if we can</i>

145
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,666
work together, we
can take back a little bit

146
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,286
<i>more power at this stage in the game.</i>

147
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,526
Okay, so if there's 12
of us, we need seven.

148
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,356
So, if you and I always have,

149
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,310
like, open conversations,
we can kind of figure out

150
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,426
what's going on and
who's telling what to who.

151
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,456
You know what I mean?
Like... I have a vision.

152
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,356
I have a vision for how
this game could go for us.

153
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,046
- Okay.
- And I like it.

154
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,456
Is it good? Is it a good vision?

155
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,876
- Yeah, it's a good vision.
- Yeah.

156
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,526
It could be, like, a big sneak attack

157
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,146
- in this game.
- Yeah.

158
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,806
That'll serve us both so well.

159
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,286
- Yeah.
- That would be so good.

160
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,906
<i>In order to change my fate,</i>

161
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,016
here's what I'm missing right now:

162
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,046
A real number one in this game.

163
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,496
I've worked closely with a few people.

164
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,836
I've worked closely

165
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,620
<i>with Sam, but that's drifting away.</i>

166
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,550
<i>And until now,</i>

167
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,310
<i>Genevieve is someone I
didn't know left from right.</i>

168
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,806
<i>I didn't really know where she stood.</i>

169
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,596
<i>I didn't know what her game plan was.</i>

170
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,100
<i>But I'm kind of seeing her, really,</i>

171
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,456
as a pretty good opportunity for me

172
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,836
<i>to pick up that one person who
also doesn't have a number one.</i>

173
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,046
- I'm excited for what we could do.
- Yeah.

174
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,076
The possibilities.

175
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

176
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,790
Wait, sue. They told me

177
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,186
I can't believe you don't play pickleball.

178
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,100
I'm, like... Being a tennis player.

179
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,456
I have played it, but it's not...

180
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,526
- It's not?
- I play racquetball every day.

181
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,310
- Yeah, so that's...
- So, and then...

182
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,836
She needs her adrenaline high.

183
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,836
<i>This morning, we're
just getting our buffs,</i>

184
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,636
we're just officially
making it into the merge.

185
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,806
<i>And it's, like, there's been
so much going on at once.</i>

186
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,976
<i>Like, we're trying to,
like, all chill at camp.</i>

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,456
<i>And then, of course,</i>

188
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,876
Genevieve comes about, and she's like

189
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,310
I have tree mail.

190
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,806
<i>In survivor,</i>

191
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,790
<i>you can't let your
guard down, and it's, like,</i>

192
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,240
actually the most exciting
part, but also terrifying.

193
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,550
"A nerve-racking situation,

194
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,596
"the vote looming overhead.

195
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,356
"Lose your focus and lose this test,

196
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,806
tonight, your game just might be dead."

197
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,286
Nice.

198
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,046
<i>So at this point, I'm, like, really</i>

199
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,496
trying to look ahead, and I'm really trying

200
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,736
to see who I'm clicking with.

201
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,596
Got to get out of this
blazer before we friggin'

202
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,806
- I love that you have a blazer.
- My god.

203
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,240
<i>Right now, I feel really
good about the tuku women.</i>

204
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,976
<i>I feel really good</i>

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,100
about, I mean, most of the
women in this game, honestly.

206
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,116
<i>I think that, ideally,</i>

207
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,620
<i>I'm going to find six
to eight of these people</i>

208
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,480
<i>that I really feel like can work together,</i>

209
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,426
<i>and we can start kind of</i>

210
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,186
picking off "the other
side," quote, unquote,

211
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,806
you know, whoever that may be.

212
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,170
Like, we all...

213
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,480
Exactly.

214
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,766
- Dude, that'd be... sick.
- Yes.

215
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,076
I would love...

216
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,620
And we have the power
to do it, so let's do it.

217
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,356
In the survivor lexicon, I feel like

218
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,806
the all-girls alliance is almost, like,

219
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,116
mythologized at this point.

220
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,806
It's been done before.

221
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,496
<i>We've seen the black widow brigade</i>

222
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,076
<i>pull off some of the
best moves in this show.</i>

223
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,046
<i>Since then, it gets
snubbed before it even</i>

224
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,456
gets a chance to kick off and start.

225
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,930
<i>But the way that I would
dream to play this game</i>

226
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,310
is to form an all-women's
alliance and eat all the men.

227
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,860
That's, I mean, just an
ideal-case scenario for me.

228
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,666
<i>And I really like the ladies here,</i>

229
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,046
<i>and I think that we could
all get on the same page.</i>

230
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,456
So, who are... who are
some prospects? Like...

231
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,426
My god, I... Like, me,
personally... I'm sorry.

232
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,930
Gabe is a threat.

233
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,356
<i>There are more</i>

234
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,076
women than there are men
in this post-merge sequence.

235
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,456
<i>But for me, I have to really start</i>

236
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,076
<i>to weigh the options of if I want</i>

237
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,496
to continue to stay in this tuku five

238
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,860
<i>or if I want to completely flip ship</i>

239
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,496
<i>and try to form genuine connections</i>

240
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,116
<i>and a genuine alliance
on the other side, because</i>

241
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,906
I think that this is a perfect
opportunity to get Gabe out.

242
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,456
<i>I've been wanting Gabe
out since the beginning.</i>

243
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,076
<i>I feel like I cannot trust this man.</i>

244
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,666
<i>But no matter what, I
want people to see me</i>

245
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,426
<i>as an individualized player, and that</i>

246
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,420
I can make my own moves
on my own time, in my own way.

247
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,690
Come on in!

248
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:09,690
Day 13, the merged tribe of survivor 47.

249
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,310
So, Andy,

250
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,170
the last tribal council,
you voted out Rome.

251
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,426
It wasn't unanimous, but
it was the vast majority.

252
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,456
You've got the 12 people

253
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,766
that you want to move forward with

254
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,666
- and battle against.
- Yeah.

255
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,930
So now how does the game change

256
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,596
as we head into the next challenge?

257
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,596
It's just gonna get a lot tougher.

258
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,790
I feel like we got into the same beach,

259
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,310
and one person sort of

260
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,216
sunk their own game, immediately.

261
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,146
And that's a really
good consensus-builder.

262
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,496
That built this community.

263
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,046
But, now, it-it just starts.

264
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,076
It gets that much more dangerous.

265
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,596
We don't know who the next target is.

266
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,076
We have to play survivor

267
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,496
and see what shakes out tonight.

268
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,216
All right. Well, let's get
back into the game, then.

269
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,736
First things first. Kyle, got to take it back.

270
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,280
Yes, sir. Thank you.

271
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Thank you.

272
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,100
- You're holding onto that.
- Yeah.

273
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,240
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

274
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,976
For today's challenge,
you're gonna need balance,

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,216
concentration and endurance.

276
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,426
Here's how it works.

277
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,046
<i>You're gonna stand on a narrow beam</i>

278
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,930
<i>while balancing a ball at
the end of a very long pole</i>

279
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,480
<i>while holding the pole above your head.</i>

280
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,976
<i>At regular intervals, you're gonna</i>

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,496
<i>move farther down the beam,</i>

282
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,426
<i>making it more difficult to
balance and concentrate.</i>

283
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,426
<i>And the longer you're in the challenge,</i>

284
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,666
<i>more difficult to keep
that pole above your head.</i>

285
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,596
<i>If at any point you fall
off or your ball drops,</i>

286
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
<i>you're out.</i>

287
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,310
So, now that you have
the community you want,

288
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,790
let's divide that community

289
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,596
and pit you against each other.

290
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,426
Here's how it's gonna work today.

291
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,806
We're gonna randomly
divide into two groups of six.

292
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,736
The one person who lasts the longest

293
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,100
for the entire challenge wins,

294
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,240
for their group, immunity.

295
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,170
- My god.
- Everybody on that team

296
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,146
will be safe tonight at tribal council.

297
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,426
You will watch tribal council
but you won't cast a vote,

298
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,766
and you can't have a
vote cast against you.

299
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,146
You are safe. You will see

300
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,836
- day 14 of survivor 47.
- Wow.

301
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,356
The person who lasts the
longest for the losing group

302
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,426
earns individual immunity,
and you will need it,

303
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,666
because that group is
going to tribal council,

304
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,100
where somebody will be

305
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,170
the seventh person
voted out of survivor 47.

306
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,906
And as a penalty for being voted out,

307
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,660
you won't even make the jury.

308
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,240
In addition,

309
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,456
- you're playing for reward.
- All right.

310
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,766
Want to know what you're playing for?

311
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,736
The winning six will go
back to camp and enjoy

312
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,976
an afternoon of baby back ribs.

313
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,240
- My god.
- No!

314
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,930
- No.
- Potato salad.

315
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,146
- Potato salad. Potato salad.
- Yes.

316
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,116
- Potato salad.
- Corn on the cob.

317
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,170
No. Shut up.

318
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,596
Beer and soft drinks.

319
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,620
- My god.
- My god.

320
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,550
Losers, nothing but a date
with me tonight at tribal council.

321
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,286
Big enough stakes?

322
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,736
All right, gonna do a rock draw.

323
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,906
- My gosh.
- Always twisting, Jeff.

324
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,076
- Always twisting us up.
- All right, take a rock. Don't look at it.

325
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,496
You know I love this part.

326
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,550
Which color are you gonna get?

327
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,356
Which color do you want?

328
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,526
Who else is gonna have the same color?

329
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,100
Who are you gonna be competing with?

330
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,040
Who you gonna be competing against?

331
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,590
Let's see what we have.

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,520
Everybody, put out your palms,

333
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,766
and let's reveal.

334
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,116
If you are blue, come
right over here on my left.

335
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,730
- Yellow, the far end.
- Okay.

336
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,216
Feel like we got some
endurance in here today.

337
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,480
All right, so let's see
how this worked out.

338
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,496
We have Genevieve, Sierra, teeny, sol,

339
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,240
Andy and Sam.

340
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,836
Sam, what do you
make about this draw?

341
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,766
Yeah, I mean, it's three gata, three lavo,

342
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,076
and I think this is now
a team of six because

343
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,550
if one of us can clutch up for
the other five, we're all safe.

344
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,620
So, I'm trying not to think
too much about the dynamics

345
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,766
and trying to focus on
how can I make sure

346
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,790
that all six of us, feel good tonight.

347
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,426
All right, the other six.

348
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,496
We have Rachel,
Caroline, sue, tiyana, Gabe

349
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,100
- and Kyle.
- Wow.

350
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,736
Tell me, sue. You've got your hands out.

351
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,116
We have our whole tuku tribe.

352
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,596
- Plus me.
- Plus Rachel.

353
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,526
Rachel. On one hand,

354
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,976
if you lose, things, on
paper, might not look good.

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,790
- Yeah. Sure.
- Five versus one.

356
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,596
But we're in the merge.
Everybody's wearing purple.

357
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,620
Yeah. I mean, there are
other dynamics in play here.

358
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,480
And if worse comes to worse,

359
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,860
and we're the group going, like,

360
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,620
I'll-I'll do everything I can to stay safe.

361
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,356
<i>I am terrified.</i>

362
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,496
<i>I look down the line and see</i>

363
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,280
the entirety of the tuku tribe and me.

364
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,526
<i>So, I need to win today</i>

365
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,620
<i>or I'm leaving the fate of my game</i>

366
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,836
<i>in the hands of five tuku members.</i>

367
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,830
I cannot believe that this is happening.

368
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,790
All right.

369
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,526
Here we go.

370
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,286
Everybody has their
Poles above their head.

371
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,100
Balls are balanced.

372
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,730
This challenge is on.

373
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,526
Everything that you
are focused on right now

374
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,216
is about one thing:

375
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,216
Balancing that ball.

376
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,590
Do not let it drop.

377
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,666
The stakes are big.

378
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,496
The person who lasts the longest overall

379
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,766
wins, for their group, immunity and food.

380
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,766
The person who lasts the longest

381
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,860
for the losing group earns for themselves

382
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,116
individual immunity, which
you will need, because

383
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,900
the losing group is going to tribal council.

384
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,310
Andy drops. Set your pole down.

385
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,930
Take a spot on the bench.

386
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,766
My god.

387
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,930
Rachel's ball on the move.

388
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,116
Rachel cannot survive the first round.

389
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,760
Set your pole down,
take a spot on the bench.

390
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,496
Just like that, we are down to five

391
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,860
in each group.

392
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,526
Now we're gonna
move to the next section,

393
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,620
and it's a live transition.

394
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,930
You have 15 seconds to do it.

395
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,760
Starting now.

396
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,526
You got to have both feet
in that next section of beam,

397
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,100
the wood section that isn't painted.

398
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,286
Now, with everything else
you're doing, you've got to move.

399
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,070
Sierra can't do it. Sierra's out.

400
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,790
Tiyana drops. She's out.

401
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,550
Genevieve, you're good.

402
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,076
Gabe, you're good.

403
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,456
Everybody's good.

404
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,976
Back to concentrating.

405
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,906
We're down now to four on yellow

406
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,000
and four on blue, just like that.

407
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,116
You are earning it every
single day on survivor.

408
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,736
Tribal council tonight.

409
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,216
You don't know who you
can trust, who you can't.

410
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,146
Person voted out tonight will have no say

411
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,480
in how this game plays
out, won't make the jury.

412
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,860
All that work, you make the merge,

413
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,736
but you're one day short.

414
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,970
One tribal council, and it's over.

415
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,286
Sol drops. Sol takes a spot on the bench.

416
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,836
We're down to three for yellow.

417
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,620
Remember, all it takes is
one person in your group

418
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,590
to outlast everybody
else, and you are safe.

419
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,116
Day 13, survivor 47.

420
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,170
This is it, right here.

421
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,520
This is the only thing you care
about right now, nothing else.

422
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,970
All right, start making your
move to the next section.

423
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,216
Tiny steps.

424
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,100
You got time.

425
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,210
Sam, you're good.

426
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,790
Teeny, you're good.

427
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,806
Genevieve, you're good.

428
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,666
Gabe, you're good.

429
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,930
Caroline, good.

430
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,620
- Kyle, good.
- Thank you.

431
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,806
Shoot.

432
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,766
Sue drops. She's out.

433
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,456
And we're down to three on three.

434
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,076
It is a showdown right now.

435
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,836
Sam, teeny, Genevieve taking on

436
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,216
Gabe, Caroline and Kyle.

437
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,040
Comes down to one person.

438
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,070
Who can last the longest?

439
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,146
Keep concentrating.

440
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,070
Check in on your ball.

441
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,240
Little movement with
Sam, but a nice recovery.

442
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,240
Nice.

443
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,666
You are vying for immunity

444
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,216
for your yourself and,
potentially, immunity

445
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,170
for everybody else on your team.

446
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,456
You want to be a
hero, here is a moment.

447
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,240
- Nice job, teeny.
- Big food reward,

448
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,806
security tonight. It will be worth it.

449
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,550
Yeah.

450
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,976
This is where you got
to get into that tank.

451
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,930
You've got a little gas in
there. You know you do.

452
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,790
Caroline really shaking, but still in it.

453
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,970
Nice recovery.

454
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,836
All right, here we go.

455
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,906
Let's move to that next section.

456
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,450
I will tell you when you're good.

457
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,976
Everybody start making your move

458
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,550
down the beam. This is a live transition

459
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,830
to the last section.

460
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,286
Gabe can't do it. He's out.

461
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,860
Caroline, you're good.

462
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,100
Caroline drops. She's out.

463
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,736
Genevieve, you're good.

464
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,100
- Sam, you're good.
- Keep going, Kyle.

465
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,310
- Good job, Kyle.
- Kyle's ball is on the move.

466
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,520
Sam drops. He's out.

467
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Kyle trying to hang on.

468
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,170
Teeny fighting to hang in there.

469
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,760
Genevieve fighting to hang in there.

470
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,116
No.

471
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,046
Kyle's out. That's it. It is over.

472
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,286
Just like that.

473
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,596
Teeny, Genevieve, you don't have

474
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,906
to compete anymore.

475
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,906
Kyle's earned individual immunity.

476
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,526
It doesn't matter on yellow.

477
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,146
The entire group has immunity.

478
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,620
Wow.

479
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,350
My god, I didn't think I'd last.

480
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,596
Good news for Genevieve, teeny, Sierra,

481
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,860
Andy, sol and Sam.

482
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,766
Group immunity, no need
for individual immunity.

483
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,480
Nobody from your group going home.

484
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,480
You will go to tribal council tonight.

485
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,046
You will watch tribal council.

486
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,836
You will not cast a vote,

487
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,620
and nobody can cast a vote for you.

488
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,240
But for now, the six of
you are going back to camp.

489
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,046
Baby back ribs, potato
salad, corn on the cob,

490
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,736
beer and soft drinks.

491
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,100
- Yes.
- On the other side, Kyle, come on over.

492
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,076
For the second straight time,

493
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,976
individual immunity is yours.

494
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,426
Well, you're still struggling.

495
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,426
- Man, that's no joke right there.
- Yeah?

496
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,550
That-that messes with a guy.

497
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,456
- Good job, Kyle.
- Kyle,

498
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,496
for the second straight time this season,

499
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,076
individual immunity is yours.
That means you are safe tonight,

500
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,116
cannot be voted out of this game.

501
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,766
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

502
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,836
Have a spot back with your group.

503
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,286
All right, for the six of you... Gabe, sue,

504
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,526
Caroline, tiyana, Rachel and Kyle

505
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,860
you are not going
back to your tribe camp.

506
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,240
You're gonna go to the old lavo camp,

507
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,930
where you will spend the afternoon

508
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,800
with no food, nothing
but time to figure out

509
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,706
what's gonna happen
tonight at tribal council.

510
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,666
You'll go to tribal council
directly from that camp.

511
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,930
Tonight, the seventh person

512
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,426
voted out will not make the jury.

513
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,496
Biggest stakes so far in this season.

514
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,946
Grab your stuff, head out.
See you tonight at tribal.

515
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,860
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Jeff.

516
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,970
<i>We're going to tribal.</i>

517
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,456
<i>And even though I was, like,</i>

518
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,596
<i>trying to herd cats with this
alliance at tuku sometimes,</i>

519
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,216
we have a great contingency plan

520
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,356
because Rachel's the only
person who wasn't on the tuku tribe.

521
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,620
We have an easy vote out

522
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,456
<i>with Rachel, in my opinion.</i>

523
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,480
<i>However, the easy vote
might not be a smart vote,</i>

524
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,550
<i>and I want to make a smart move.</i>

525
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,836
- Let's go.
- My god.

526
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,496
Holy cow.

527
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,146
Potato salad looks like the best
thing I've ever seen in my life.

528
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,256
- Who wants a beer?
- Yes, please! -I would love a beer.

529
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,596
<i>Today was another
fantastic day in Fiji because</i>

530
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,860
I surprised myself and
maybe everybody else

531
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,050
<i>and helped win the
challenge for the yellow group</i>

532
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,146
<i>which included safety for all six of us.</i>

533
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,930
<i>It included food for
all six of us, and we all</i>

534
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,240
have the certainty knowing
that we made the jury.

535
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,046
So, today was, like,
chef's kiss, perfect day.

536
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,240
This looks like the best
potato salad I've ever seen.

537
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,620
- More ribs? -Please.
- Yeah.

538
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,790
I feel like I'm not even taking the...

539
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,766
The proper amount of time to, like

540
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,076
- I know.
- Appreciate the fact

541
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,636
- that we are all safe tonight.
- My god.

542
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,310
- We make it to...
- We made the journey.

543
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,930
No matter what happens, we are here

544
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,356
to vote for the winner.

545
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,660
I want to know what's happening.

546
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,426
I want to know what's going on.

547
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,046
- We're gonna watch it.
- Are we watching

548
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,766
or, like, participating?

549
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,526
We're watching.

550
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,350
- Really?
- Only watching, not talking, yeah.

551
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,806
Yeah.

552
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,240
- Poor Rachel.
- I know. Can we talk about

553
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,790
Rachel being the only one?

554
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,216
- I think she's in trouble.
- I think... - Really?

555
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,596
<i>My former gata members</i>

556
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,666
<i>and I get to bond with the former</i>

557
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,806
lavo members, a-and
really kind of solidify

558
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,806
<i>some trust and common happiness</i>

559
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,480
<i>and joy with sol, teeny and Genevieve.</i>

560
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,240
<i>But then, I realized,</i>

561
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,426
<i>my gata girl Rachel's over
there with the losing group.</i>

562
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,426
<i>She's sitting there with five tukus,</i>

563
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,550
<i>the entire tribe.</i>

564
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,550
<i>She's the odd woman out. Like,</i>

565
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,146
if things hold to form,

566
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,736
she's just getting picked off tonight

567
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,666
and there's nothing
that I can do to save her.

568
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,906
The fact that that tuku group is...

569
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,356
Five strong is scary.

570
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,356
So, if it is Rachel
tonight and Rachel goes,

571
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,240
I would like to see this six

572
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,596
- vote together in the next...
- Yeah.

573
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,216
- Truly.
- Thing.

574
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,637
I know.

575
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:58,046
I think we need to knock
off some of those tukus,

576
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,146
- especially if there's five of 'em.
- Yeah, we would.

577
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,900
- If they stay strong tonight.
- I agree.

578
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,620
<i>Because there was a triple amulet played</i>

579
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,076
<i>at the last tribal council,
which acted as a full idol,</i>

580
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,496
<i>I think it's possible that there
could be some sort of idol</i>

581
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,766
or advantage hidden, which
would be massively important.

582
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,906
<i>And if anyone were to find it,
then it could change everything.</i>

583
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,286
I think someone's gonna find an idol.

584
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,790
I think it's gonna be a crazy tribal.

585
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,620
<i>My gut is just on the ground.</i>

586
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,146
<i>This is worst-case scenario.</i>

587
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,310
There's just nothing you
can do in certain situations

588
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,736
if you draw the wrong-colored rock,

589
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,310
and you just get put between
a literal rock and a hard place.

590
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,426
<i>You can always hope that
there's divisions and cracks</i>

591
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,620
<i>within original tribes, but you can't look</i>

592
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,806
at five tuku members
and one gata member

593
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,520
and not think, "well, that's easy."

594
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,116
Look, guys, I know it's a pretty

595
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,550
precarious situation for me.

596
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,480
So, if you guys want your
time, I will give it to you,

597
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,286
but I'd also appreciate
everybody else's time.

598
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,046
Of course. Yup.

599
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,046
<i>Rachel was somebody
who has been perceived</i>

600
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,860
<i>as a very big threat in this game early on.</i>

601
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,356
She's very personable,
she's very charismatic.

602
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,976
<i>She's also very smart.</i>

603
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,526
<i>So to have her in this
vulnerable of a position</i>

604
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,860
is very advantageous

605
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,930
for everybody in season 47 right now.

606
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,280
Yeah.

607
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,520
Okay.

608
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,836
<i>The way that rock draw
at the challenge played out</i>

609
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,526
<i>was also perfect for tuku</i>

610
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,496
because it's one more tribal

611
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,590
that all five of us get to survive.

612
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,736
<i>All these people are in this game</i>

613
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,496
are tools for me to use,

614
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,736
and having this tuku majority survive

615
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,790
as long as it can is a very valuable tool.

616
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,450
Yeah.

617
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,790
The thing is, though,

618
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,356
that means when Rachel
leaves, <i>they have six now,</i>

619
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,240
<i>with three lavos, three gatos.</i>

620
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,766
<i>They're gonna come after one of us.</i>

621
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,146
<i>From the outside looking in,</i>

622
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,526
<i>Rachel is the obvious
vote. It's super easy.</i>

623
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:53,170
<i>However, I know with
my whole frigging heart</i>

624
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,100
that if we go back to our camp

625
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,806
with five strong of tuku,

626
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,046
we are going to be picked off

627
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,806
because we don't have the majority

628
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,806
and we totally blew our cover.

629
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,790
<i>We technically lied to everyone else</i>

630
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,930
<i>about how close we were.</i>

631
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,760
So, not only are we really,
really strong, but we're liars.

632
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,596
What are we supposed to do with that?

633
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,836
This kind of seems like
the perfect opportunity

634
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,116
to get Gabe out.

635
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,180
- Yeah, it is a perfect opportunity for it.
- Yeah.

636
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,076
<i>"Right away, I kind of was
like, "Rachel, you're doomed.</i>

637
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,836
<i>No doubt about it."</i>

638
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,620
<i>But then I realized it
doesn't have to be Rachel.</i>

639
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,620
This could be the prime
opportunity to get rid of Gabe.

640
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,610
There's a very good
chance that it could stick.

641
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,766
You have a better connection
with Rachel than I do.

642
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,876
- Do you think you could pitch it to her?
- Okay. Caroline?

643
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,286
<i>So, we need Rachel to be all in on this.</i>

644
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,860
<i>We need her to not play
that shot in the dark because</i>

645
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,736
we're about to make
something awesome happen.

646
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,526
I'm gonna be, like, totally
straight-up and honest with you.

647
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,100
I want to work with
you, and I know that, like,

648
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,550
you are also close with,
like, Sierra, and, like,

649
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,076
you make good connections

650
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,076
because I feel like
you're a genuine person.

651
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,396
I feel really good about you ladies.

652
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,806
Like, so good.

653
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,170
So... my game plan

654
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,620
that I just brought up to Kyle

655
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,930
I'm gonna pretend like it's five strong.

656
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,976
But I've been itching for an
opportunity to get Gabe out.

657
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,906
<i>Okay.</i>

658
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,286
I mean, I love to hear
it. I wasn't sure because,

659
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,793
you know, like, it's hard
to read the dynamics.

660
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:28,186
E-Exactly.

661
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,666
And, like, you do a good
job of, like, you know,

662
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,116
- seeming very tight, so...
- No.

663
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,356
<i>Tiyana comes up to me and says,</i>

664
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,100
"I actually want to get Gabe out."

665
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,860
<i>I mean, that's music
to my ears, obviously.</i>

666
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,046
<i>I'm gonna vote for whoever that's not me</i>

667
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,480
to get me out of this very sticky situation.

668
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,146
The thing is, it all comes
down to, I think, Caroline.

669
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,790
<i>But I know she's a smart girl.</i>

670
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,480
<i>She knows, moving forward,
if we go back with five, we are</i>

671
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,836
- completely screwed. Like, there's no...
- Yeah, I get it.

672
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,180
Everyone is gonna gang up on you.

673
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,706
- Everyone is gonna gang up on us.
- Yeah.

674
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,806
And honestly, what better way
to prove that we have cracks

675
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,426
- than to vote out Gabe?
- Yeah.

676
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,146
<i>What tiyana's saying is completely true.</i>

677
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,240
Tuku is already a very
threatening presence as it is.

678
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,620
And to go back and
show that they are united

679
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,806
in voting out someone who, you know,

680
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,496
is pretty much on "the bottom,"

681
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,906
<i>as far as anybody can tell</i>

682
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,396
<i>I was left out on the Anika vote and now</i>

683
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,596
<i>I'm the freaking underdog here... like,</i>

684
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,116
that's not a good look for them.

685
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,496
And so, tiyana has, like,
a very good point that

686
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,146
<i>taking out someone like
Gabe would be really smart.</i>

687
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,906
<i>So, if tiyana can swing Caroline</i>

688
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,496
<i>and Kyle wants to also go
along with this Gabe plan,</i>

689
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,420
like, I'm in.

690
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,790
Wow.

691
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,736
I don't normally like ribs,
but those are amazing.

692
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,480
So psyched we won that.

693
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,550
I'm full. I don't even want to say it.

694
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,736
<i>This has been a very
interesting and weird season</i>

695
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,076
<i>in terms of advantages.</i>

696
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,526
They've all shown themselves early.

697
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,930
A lot of advantages have come out

698
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,076
and kind of just been
flushed sort of preemptively,

699
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,216
<i>or in weird situations, like
at last night's tribal council.</i>

700
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,526
<i>And when those leave the game,</i>

701
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,906
new ones come to replace
them, typically, and so,

702
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,496
<i>finding an advantage could be</i>

703
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,310
<i>a very, very, very beneficial thing for me.</i>

704
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,860
<i>Andy has just been somebody</i>

705
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,806
<i>we've been keeping around
because we needed his vote</i>

706
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,790
<i>on gata, so I am not surprised</i>

707
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,326
<i>that Andy is searching for an advantage.</i>

708
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,976
<i>And he's a sloppy
player, plain and simple.</i>

709
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,046
He's just all over. You
can't, like, track him.

710
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,270
And I'm like, that's just not
somebody I can work with.

711
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,456
<i>Now that I'm working with Andy,</i>

712
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,860
<i>I cannot stress enough
how important it is</i>

713
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,310
<i>for him to be careful.</i>

714
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,806
I honestly feel like if you
go looking for an advantage

715
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,666
this early into merge,

716
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,280
<i>you have to be sure that you can find it.</i>

717
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,976
<i>I'm at this amazing reward.</i>

718
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,906
I'm loving everything
about life in this moment.

719
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,286
<i>We're all just kind of chilling, you know,</i>

720
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,480
<i>getting our, food comas on, taking naps,</i>

721
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,666
<i>and, I'm just not tired, and</i>

722
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,766
<i>I'm like, "hey, sometimes
there's something on these,</i>

723
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,620
rewards, some type of advantage."

724
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,976
<i>And so, I start creeping
around, you know, taking a look,</i>

725
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,900
<i>and I'm making sure
everyone's got their eyes closed.</i>

726
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,790
<i>So, I feel like I have free rein</i>

727
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,596
<i>to go searching for an idol.</i>

728
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,046
<i>I'm, like, looking, you know,</i>

729
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,456
<i>around the plates and everything.</i>

730
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,040
<i>And so, I'm like, "ain't nothing here."</i>

731
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,286
<i>Then, all of a sudden, on
the corner of my eye, I see</i>

732
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,216
<i>and the way it was positioned,</i>

733
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,666
<i>it was hidden very, very well</i>

734
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,310
<i>because it almost camouflaged.</i>

735
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,976
<i>Like, it was right next to me for an hour,</i>

736
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,690
<i>and I never saw it.</i>

737
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,666
Feels so good to just lay in the sun.

738
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,906
I'm just, like, taking it in.

739
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,596
This is amazing.

740
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,596
<i>I've been looking for so long.</i>

741
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,046
<i>I do my very best to be chill, be calm,</i>

742
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,860
<i>"but inside, and I'm like," damn,</i>

743
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,286
<i>this could shift the game."</i>

744
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,596
- Look at it.
- My god.

745
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,906
- I don't like that.
- It was so good.

746
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,766
Look at it. Bones!

747
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,906
- Well, hey, we did that.
- Bones.

748
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,210
- You guys did it!
- Well done. Look at that.

749
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,116
Okay. We talk out loud.

750
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,976
This is not... I'm not saying that I'm

751
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,566
- going to do it.
- Let's purely brainstorm. Yes.

752
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,590
Purely brainstorm.

753
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,286
You would never think of actually

754
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,836
getting Gabe out, would you?

755
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,310
Are you debating?

756
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,860
Let's... I want to hear your...

757
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,456
'Cause, like, the whole
thing is that this is an alliance

758
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,116
- where we talk things through.
- Right. Exactly.

759
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,496
- Yes.
- Like, I just know,

760
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,480
keeping the five strong
would be awesome.

761
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,620
But we can't.

762
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,736
If we come back with five...

763
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,076
- We are screwed.
- Yeah.

764
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,496
<i>Tiyana mentioned, you know,</i>

765
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,286
going after Gabe is an option,

766
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,790
and it's something we should debate.

767
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,310
<i>And there is a fear that</i>

768
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,736
<i>if we successfully vote out Rachel,</i>

769
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,146
<i>five tuku strong,</i>

770
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,860
we get picked off one after one after one.

771
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,930
I think you're right

772
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,930
in that they're gonna come after us

773
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,170
- yeah.
- When we're five.

774
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,766
Here's the thing. I think
they will go after us,

775
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,456
but they're not going after us.

776
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,946
<i>They're gonna go after Kyle if he doesn't</i>

777
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,426
<i>get the necklace. And if he does</i>

778
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,046
- <i>get the necklace, it's Gabe.
- Yeah.</i>

779
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,596
Here's another thought. I
personally think Rachel is

780
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,356
<i>the most dangerous player in this game,</i>

781
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,216
<i>and I actually think
it's much easier for us</i>

782
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,930
<i>to get numbers with
girls with Rachel out,</i>

783
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,146
because Rachel's the one
who's connecting everyone.

784
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,426
Rachel is the best
I've seen in a long time.

785
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,116
I personally think Rachel
is the glue of the gata tribe,

786
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,356
and if we get rid of her,

787
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,976
a lot of options open up for tiyana and I.

788
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,216
Once Rachel's gone, it's easier

789
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,146
for us to be in the mix.

790
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,216
If it was anyone but Rachel, I'd be down.

791
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,900
I agree with you.

792
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,356
That's so... For Rachel, man.

793
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,076
I like her, too. That's
the issue. Guess what?

794
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,636
Out of all of them, I liked her the best.

795
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,046
I do like her the best.

796
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,930
- She's that good.
- Right.

797
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,596
<i>Caroline does bite just a little bit,</i>

798
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,976
but she does have some reservations.

799
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,116
<i>And since Caroline is not on board,</i>

800
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,356
<i>it really is disappointing, because</i>

801
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,356
I wish, wish, wish

802
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,900
<i>that there was a way to
get Gabe out of the game.</i>

803
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,496
I think tonight can be

804
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,736
- one of two things, right?
- Yeah.

805
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,116
We can go tuku strong, five deep.

806
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,456
But, like, what problems does that create

807
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,766
- when we get back home?
- Yeah, definitely.

808
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,806
And I think it creates
a lot of big problems

809
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,456
- when we get back home.
- A lot of big problems.

810
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,310
Or we can get somebody
we've been wanting to get out

811
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,310
for a bit now out of the game.

812
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,480
<i>Everybody on tuku seems
to be on the same page:</i>

813
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,046
<i>It's Rachel tonight.</i>

814
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,620
The dilemma is how can we get her

815
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,116
to not play her shot in the dark?

816
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,216
<i>Because if she plays her shot in the dark</i>

817
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,496
<i>and it hits, then we got
to cannibalize each other,</i>

818
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,680
and we don't want to do that.

819
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,766
<i>We can go back,</i>

820
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,906
<i>and we don't have this tuku majority</i>

821
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,736
- target on our back anymore.
- Right.

822
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,046
And that's the thing
that I'm most scared of.

823
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,550
Y-You know, I'm no dummy.

824
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,906
If we were to take all five of us back,

825
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,860
I'm not the last person on the list

826
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,356
- that people want to get out.
- Yeah. Yeah.

827
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,836
- I'm gonna be high on that list.
- Yeah.

828
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,146
<i>Gabe's plan... because he is also</i>

829
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,456
so adamant that if they
go back as a strong five,

830
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,806
that he'll be next or
he'll be the one after next

831
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,976
he wants Caroline out.

832
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,836
<i>I want to believe it, but all the bs</i>

833
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,550
<i>that I've bought along
the way in this game</i>

834
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,480
it's felt so good, it's felt so right.

835
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,310
In that moment, it made
sense, and yet it was all fake.

836
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,860
If nothing else, you, me, Kyle

837
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,496
could throw a three on Caroline,

838
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,596
and in our worst-case
scenario, we're going to a tie.

839
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,426
But then what happens?

840
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,426
I mean, I would go to rocks

841
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,216
- over that, because...
- Genuinely?

842
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,526
Well, I mean, what the... am I
supposed to do at that point?

843
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:47,808
Yeah.

844
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:49,766
Because then it's like,
"hey, Caroline, like,"

845
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,496
- I put your name down."
- Yeah.

846
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,356
And then, "okay. Hey, I'm sorry."

847
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,046
- Yeah, valid, valid.
- Like, i-I'll backtrack,

848
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,995
and, you know like,
"okay, let's just do Rachel."

849
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:57,286
Yeah.

850
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,706
- So, it's, like... you know?
- My god, Gabe.

851
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,326
I mean, you're giving
me so much hope here.

852
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,216
<i>It's, like, the best thing I
could have ever hoped for</i>

853
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,456
and it sounds so
implausible at the same time.

854
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,426
<i>Either tuku is completely playing me</i>

855
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,860
<i>or maybe I have some
kind of hope in this game,</i>

856
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,550
and I'm still figuring
out which-which one it is.

857
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,496
- Well, thank you.
- So... yeah, of course.

858
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,736
- Can I hug you?
- Of course.

859
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,116
- Yeah, of course. Of course.
- My god.

860
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,216
<i>This is by far the most precarious place</i>

861
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,426
<i>I've been in this game,</i>

862
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,596
because at least in the other situations,

863
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,076
I wasn't actually the person
on the chopping block.

864
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,666
<i>If I screw up tonight, I will not be</i>

865
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,620
on the jury, I will not
be in this game anymore.

866
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,970
And I... That's... terrifying.

867
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,420
No foul balls over here.

868
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,040
Change up. Change up.

869
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,456
<i>I found my first advantage in this game.</i>

870
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,100
<i>I was cool, calm, and I found it.</i>

871
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,620
And so, I'm pretty
sure no one else saw it.

872
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,116
In fact, I know nobody else saw it.

873
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,820
<i>Otherwise, they would
have said something.</i>

874
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,790
Home run!

875
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,666
<i>So now, I'm gonna have</i>

876
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,526
<i>to put on my Oscar-winning performance</i>

877
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,526
<i>and go off all by myself,</i>

878
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,170
<i>because in this game,
secrets are very, very rare.</i>

879
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,170
<i>But for me, I'm keeping it to myself.</i>

880
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,356
So right now, no one else knows

881
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,806
in this game what I'm about to pull.

882
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,596
Come on, come on. What is it?

883
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,690
What is it? What is it?

884
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,496
<i>I got a lot of power right now.</i>

885
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,100
<i>I finally get to use an
advantage in this game</i>

886
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,310
and change the outcome of some things.

887
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,806
My god. That's gonna be so great.

888
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,146
What this advantage does is it gives

889
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,806
someone the opportunity to block a vote.

890
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,426
<i>Which is simply, if someone
writes a vote, you can say,</i>

891
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,356
"nope, that's not gonna count."

892
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,930
Or they can have safety without power.

893
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,766
So, in the middle of tribal council,

894
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,790
they can literally just leave tribal council,

895
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,596
go back to camp, and they're safe.

896
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,356
I got to think about this.

897
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,000
It's a good day, baby.

898
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,836
I just want go to tribal.

899
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,836
My god. It's close to sundown.

900
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,216
I think we're leaving soon.

901
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,620
I want to go to tribal right now.

902
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,286
- Like, right now. I can't.
- I can't think of that now.

903
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,456
Like, I'm... Like, my entire body is just

904
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,240
- I just want to get it over with.
- Yeah.

905
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,526
<i>This is a big decision, and</i>

906
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,946
I'm not sure what I'm gonna do yet.

907
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,170
<i>I could give it to Rachel, but I'm not sure</i>

908
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,426
<i>if that's actually good for my game.</i>

909
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,170
<i>And if I don't give it to Rachel,</i>

910
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,356
<i>then I could build incredible bonds</i>

911
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,930
<i>with someone on the tuku tribe</i>

912
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,286
<i>and have another
option to get to the end.</i>

913
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,906
<i>Ultimately,</i>

914
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,596
what it's gonna come down to
is what's gonna help my game.

915
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,356
<i>I want to help somebody else,</i>

916
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,146
<i>but this decision is based
on what's best for me.</i>

917
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,860
<i>My heart is beating very, very fast,</i>

918
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,100
<i>and I just can't wait to get it going.</i>

919
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,550
Now bring in the other six.

920
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,550
All right. So, last tribal council,

921
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,976
we had everybody... 13 people.

922
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,100
Now we're back down to small numbers.

923
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,790
Six people chosen
randomly, and we had the most

924
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,496
lopsided draw we
could have with five tuku

925
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,100
the most people left in
the game from one tribe,

926
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,930
and Rachel. On top of it, you have to

927
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,116
make this decision in front of six people

928
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,790
who can just watch
because they're not in trouble.

929
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,620
They don't vote. But,
man, they can observe.

930
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,356
All right, so let's look at the obvious.

931
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,046
If there was no emotion or game play

932
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,046
and it was just
numbers, take out Rachel.

933
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,286
But any time you hear
the word "easy" on survivor,

934
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,766
you should be terrified,
because survivor is never easy.

935
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,836
Caroline, five tuku.

936
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,100
Maybe this is a time to make a move.

937
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,286
Maybe you don't want
to be part of all five tuku.

938
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,566
Here's an opportunity, because
you have Rachel as a vote.

939
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,766
I can guarantee you that was
running through people's minds.

940
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,790
We have to realize
numbers are numbers,

941
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,456
and it's gonna look threatening.

942
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,596
But it sucks, 'cause I see
pros and cons both ways,

943
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,480
and it's hard to figure out

944
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,550
which one is gonna hurt my game less.

945
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,496
Gabe, one of the premises of survivor

946
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,356
is numbers. You got
to have the numbers.

947
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,736
But if you have too many numbers,

948
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,216
then you got to get rid
of some of the numbers

949
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,976
because too many looks threatening.

950
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,736
I look around and I see the five people

951
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,100
that I've been with for 13 days so far.

952
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,496
And I know, on the
surface, it looks simple,

953
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,806
but any of those five people might say,

954
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,860
"tonight's a hell of a night to
make one of those moves."

955
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,146
So, Rachel, the minute
the challenge ended

956
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,596
and you had lost and you
knew you were coming here,

957
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,146
you could not have predicted to hear,

958
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,456
"Rachel's not a for-sure.

959
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,930
There are opportunities
all over the place."

960
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,480
I mean, yeah.

961
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,806
This rock draw, nobody
can deny that this is, like,

962
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,736
the worst-case scenario.

963
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,286
But I don't know

964
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,836
if Gabe is blowing smoke
up my ass right now.

965
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,116
If you're actually a tight five,

966
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,766
and you're trying to stay together,

967
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:20,620
the plan would be to convince
me that you have cracks,

968
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,356
and to get me not to
play my shot in the dark.

969
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,790
So, it's scary.

970
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,830
It's not been an easy day for me.

971
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,170
Kyle, once again,

972
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,736
you have individual
immunity, and it does give you

973
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,216
just a little bit of breath

974
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,076
that you can stand back and
say, "I'm noticing some things."

975
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,426
What'd you see?

976
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,836
Yeah, so, Rachel did a good job today.

977
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,736
I mean, she took time
to pull everybody aside.

978
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,736
She talked in groups,

979
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,286
she went on solo
adventures with people.

980
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,496
She did her job, trying to find cracks,

981
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,906
and may have found some,
and... And she did her little wiggle.

982
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:54,526
Tiyana, I find it fascinating that you have

983
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,766
five tuku members, all
maybe independently thinking,

984
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,350
"how could I use Rachel?"

985
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,766
You really just put
our pickle on blast, Jeff.

986
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,286
That's exactly what I've been
thinking all day long because

987
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,806
this is a very important vote. Like,

988
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,976
being able to make the
jury, for me, personally,

989
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,666
it just means the absolute world,

990
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,456
and I know it means the
world to everybody here.

991
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,620
So, I got to go with my gut,

992
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,426
and honestly, with the vote tonight,

993
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,906
I'm just hoping that I send a message

994
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,526
to the people that I really trust

995
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,146
that I can be worked
with and I'm someone that

996
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,170
can be trusted in an alliance.

997
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,906
Caroline, tell me more about

998
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,906
the importance of making the jury.

999
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,806
I think the universal feeling that

1000
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,286
I want to say almost every
single survivor player has

1001
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,286
who actually cares about the game

1002
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,216
you want to have an impact on the game.

1003
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,906
It's not that we're sitting here
dreaming of being on the jury,

1004
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,620
but we're dreaming of
having an absolute, tangible,

1005
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,976
irrefutable piece of evidence

1006
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,350
that we made an impact on this game.

1007
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,480
All right. So, Rachel,
for you, this afternoon,

1008
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,496
the subject line is easy.

1009
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,116
"Vote, vote, vote. I'm a vote."

1010
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,790
But you're not just a vote.

1011
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,240
You want this vote to have
some impact tomorrow.

1012
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:04,906
Well, I think

1013
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,906
sometimes in survivor, you
can plan three steps ahead

1014
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,836
and sometimes you just
have to get through the night.

1015
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,170
And today was one of those days

1016
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,566
where I just had to get through the night.

1017
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,310
And so, today was

1018
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,766
anybody else that I
can possibly, like, hope

1019
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,216
that these people want
to vote out that isn't me.

1020
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,286
When you went from person to person,

1021
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,526
was your hope meter undulating?

1022
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,216
It undulated. There was some chaos.

1023
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,146
There was some
paranoia. There were stories

1024
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,596
that were not cross-checking, and

1025
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,496
this has been the hardest
day of survivor for me.

1026
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,146
So, sue, given where
we are in the game,

1027
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,550
and all the uncertainty,
maybe the five tuku,

1028
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,170
for tonight, take out Rachel.
That's the easy move.

1029
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,706
"And we all make the
jury and we'll figure it out."

1030
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,620
Yeah, that is the easiest move,

1031
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,596
and it's almost like
the most obvious move.

1032
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,550
But, you know, I learned real quick,

1033
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,550
this game basically
changes almost on the hour.

1034
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,046
You can't predict anything.

1035
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,046
You can say, "okay,
I'm set in stone this way."

1036
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,456
Next thing you know,
you're totally flip-flopped.

1037
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,116
So it's just, like, my head is spinning.

1038
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,930
It's really, really... this is
very difficult for me tonight.

1039
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,550
Tiyana, part of playing
survivor is making a move,

1040
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,620
but also, maybe to not make a move.

1041
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,906
Is that part of the discussion
that tuku was having?

1042
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,836
"We could just vote out Rachel"?

1043
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,256
Absolutely, that was always an option.

1044
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,736
I mean, just look at five versus one.

1045
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,076
It kind of seems like the obvious option,

1046
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,356
but you want to make big moves

1047
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,860
because if I just go for it
and I swing for the fences

1048
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,550
and it doesn't work out,
at least I know I went for it.

1049
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,426
What happens if tomorrow,
I didn't take that chance

1050
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,100
and I go home with regrets?

1051
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,906
That is, like, my biggest nightmare

1052
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,356
from this entire experience is
going home with any regrets.

1053
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,976
This is your shot.
This is your opportunity.

1054
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,736
You got to go for it or
you're gonna miss it.

1055
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,526
Caroline, the risk is

1056
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,550
the tuku five blow it tonight.

1057
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,620
You had five. This was easy.

1058
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,076
And you make a move
and it was a little too soon.

1059
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,356
I think you're hitting the nail on the head.

1060
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,216
In the new era, there's such
an emphasis on big moves,

1061
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,426
and granted, big
moves win you the game,

1062
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,496
but it's big, smart moves.

1063
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,216
There's a very big
distinction between a big move

1064
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,286
that changes things

1065
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:08,766
in a way that's not good for you,

1066
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,596
in a way that blows up your game.

1067
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,100
And that's what I'm
playing my game on, is

1068
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,850
what are the smart
moves that I can make?

1069
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,620
Sometimes they're not always flashy,

1070
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,976
but I'm making the moves
that are best for my game

1071
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,046
and for my alliance.

1072
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,240
So, Rachel, it all centers around you.

1073
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,906
The tuku five are in charge.

1074
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,076
The question is can you find a way

1075
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,550
to get at least one or two
of them to come with you

1076
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,806
and try to make a
move? What's the feeling?

1077
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:37,550
Is it optimistic, pessimistic or hopeful?

1078
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,076
You know, still anxious,
but anxiously hopeful.

1079
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,426
I think that I know
what the plan is tonight,

1080
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,596
and I think that I'm a part of that plan,

1081
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,170
and I have given my word
that I'm gonna do something

1082
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,240
and I intend to do it
and I just really hope that

1083
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,666
no one's giving me a shakedown.

1084
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,480
Gabe, concerning at
all that Rachel's saying,

1085
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,256
"hey, man, I was told there's
a plan and I'm a part of it

1086
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,310
and if it works, I'm
gonna be here tonight"?

1087
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,170
Well, I mean, it's concerning

1088
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,356
if you don't know what that plan is.

1089
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,286
And depending on what
perspective you look at it on,

1090
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,930
Rachel could be totally helpless,

1091
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,480
drowning in the water, hoping
somebody grabs her hand.

1092
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,930
But if she can sow enough
discord between all of us,

1093
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,736
all of a sudden, Rachel might be sitting

1094
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,286
on top of the mountain saying,

1095
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,046
"I'm choosing who's going home tonight."

1096
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,480
And that's a pretty
crazy thing to think about

1097
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,480
when you really dig deep into it.

1098
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,736
So, as we get ready for the vote,

1099
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,596
it seems like it is a very simple question.

1100
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,596
"Will the tuku five stick together

1101
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,280
or are the tuku five going
to turn on each other?"

1102
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,666
All right, it is time to vote.

1103
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:46,830
- Sue.
- Jeff?

1104
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:54,046
About 20 minutes...
and I mean 20 minutes

1105
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,766
before we left for tribal,

1106
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:58,240
I found a scroll in my
bag. And when I ran

1107
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,930
into the woods to
read it, I discovered that

1108
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,286
somebody sent me... An advantage...

1109
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,860
Only good for tonight.

1110
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,480
Rachel, read your advantage for me.

1111
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,380
Sorry. My hands are shaking.

1112
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,496
"When Jeff says it's time to vote,

1113
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,000
announce that you have the
safety without power advantage."

1114
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,976
"You will leave tribal council immediately.

1115
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,286
"You will not cast a vote

1116
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,520
but more importantly,
you cannot be voted out."

1117
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,860
So, I hope that you all understand.

1118
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,806
My husband gave me a
couple words of wisdom

1119
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,356
before I came out here
and one of them was,

1120
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,496
"do not go home with
something in your pocket."

1121
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,766
So, assuming I was
getting strays tonight,

1122
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,790
this is a lifeline, and thank
you to whoever sent it.

1123
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,736
All right. So, Rachel's playing

1124
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,806
the safety without power. Rachel,

1125
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:01,930
you can grab your
torch, head back to camp.

1126
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,240
Well, that answers that question

1127
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,280
about the tuku five.

1128
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,040
My god.

1129
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,836
So... Now what?

1130
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,906
- Clearly, - this was a shock.
- Yes.

1131
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,310
Yeah, little bit.

1132
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,620
We're going to vote tonight.

1133
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,456
It is going to be a tuku member,

1134
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,860
and it's going to happen
soon. So, Gabe, where are we?

1135
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:33,550
I mean, you know,
the game has changed.

1136
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,396
- Just like that.
- That goes without saying.

1137
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,116
The game has certainly changed.

1138
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,146
There were many times

1139
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,456
where we had to be
prepared to go to tribal

1140
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,806
as a tuku five before the merge.

1141
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,116
People kind of got to wind the clock back

1142
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,240
in their head a little bit
and think about, "well",

1143
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,550
"if we lost immunity with five people,

1144
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,186
"what were we gonna
do again?" You know?

1145
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:55,326
And so, I think that's kind
of where a lot of people's

1146
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,526
- heads are at.
- Kyle, this is fascinating.

1147
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,170
I mean, what Gabe just said

1148
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,906
"it's as if we did a time warp.

1149
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,480
We're back to the tuku tribe."

1150
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,806
So, where's your heart right now?

1151
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,286
It's pounding through
the back of my... my body.

1152
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,426
I-I don't really know.

1153
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,860
I mean, yes, of course
I'm safe, so, great.

1154
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,650
But this vote, whatever
happens right now,

1155
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,146
is going to propel into the future.

1156
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,766
It's gonna have repercussions, right?

1157
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:21,976
And that could break my
game apart, like, quick.

1158
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,100
Tiyana, you are looking up to the sky,

1159
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,766
you're looking for
answers from somewhere.

1160
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,666
What is the game now?

1161
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,790
Damn. This is... I'm not gonna lie to you.

1162
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,456
Spending 13 days with
people is not something

1163
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,860
that I take for granted, and it just is, like

1164
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,836
I don't know. My anxiety is,
like, really through the roof

1165
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,046
and it's hard to think
and process words and

1166
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,170
I even just told you that
the jury means everything.

1167
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,860
Like, getting there means everything.

1168
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,620
So... I don't know.

1169
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,806
It's gonna suck.

1170
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:02,480
Is the emotion more that you're worried

1171
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,806
you will be voted out tonight

1172
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,836
or is the emotion that
you're not sure what to do

1173
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,806
because this wasn't the plan?

1174
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,170
Both.

1175
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,790
Like, it's very, very
possible that it could be me,

1176
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,550
and that would just, like, devastate me,

1177
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,690
and that would be horrible, and...

1178
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,806
Damn. But at the same time,
I have a pit in my stomach

1179
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,480
that I got to send somebody home that

1180
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:26,666
I know really, really wants to be here.

1181
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,170
So it's almost like I'm
crying for both myself

1182
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,356
and others, and it... I've never

1183
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,661
done this before. I've never
cried for myself and others.

1184
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,046
It doesn't even make
sense because it's literally

1185
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,596
the exact same situation.

1186
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:39,216
I got to say, from here,
it makes total sense.

1187
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,666
You're terrified it could be you

1188
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,426
and if it's not you, you're
horrified by the thought

1189
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,526
that you have to do it to somebody else.

1190
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,526
My family's gonna kill me that I'm crying.

1191
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,790
Damn.

1192
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,116
Awesome. While I'm crying,

1193
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,860
everyone's talking. Okay, cool.

1194
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,240
I'm just gonna get up now.

1195
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,076
I was, like, "time

1196
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,450
for frigging debates
to happen over here."

1197
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,240
- So, we're back on?
- I...

1198
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,170
Okay.

1199
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,420
Okay.

1200
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,550
Okay.

1201
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,210
So, Caroline, what's
in your head right now?

1202
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,286
I'll be honest. I don't even know how

1203
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,860
to answer your question.
My brain is not equipped

1204
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,426
to handle this at this moment. It's not.

1205
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,900
So it's-it's just overwhelmed right now?

1206
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,170
Yeah.

1207
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:40,596
How about you, Gabe?

1208
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,836
We all have relationships.

1209
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,240
<i>Survivor is a game of relationships,</i>

1210
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,806
and you got to trust 'em.

1211
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,666
So tonight, I'm trusting my relationships,

1212
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,480
and we'll see

1213
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,930
if that trust pays off in
a few minutes, I'm sure.

1214
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,480
All right, it is time to vote.

1215
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,100
Sue, you're up.

1216
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:06,830
I'll go tally the votes.

1217
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,860
If anybody has an advantage or an idol

1218
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,480
and you want to play it, now
would be the time to do so.

1219
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,590
Okay, I'll read the votes.

1220
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,690
Gabe.

1221
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,070
Tiyana. One vote Gabe, one vote tiyana.

1222
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,930
Tiyana. That's two votes
tiyana, one vote Gabe.

1223
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,526
Seventh person voted out of survivor 47:

1224
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,076
Tiyana. That's three. That's enough.

1225
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,240
Need to bring me your torch.

1226
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,210
Tiyana, the tribe has spoken.

1227
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,310
Time for you to go.

1228
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,100
No. No. No, no.

1229
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,480
Grab your torches, head back to camp.

1230
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,620
Good night.

1238

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1239
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:18,590
They're not gonna see me coming.

1240
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,566
I thought I could trust

1241

<i>I think I played a genuinely honest game,</i>

1246
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:37,310
<i>and it was true to myself,</i>

1247
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,076
and I don't regret the
way I played the game.

1248
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,620
I just regret who I trusted.
