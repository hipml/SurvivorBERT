>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,587
<i>Survivor:</i> 16 castaways began

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,673
their adventure as four tribes.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,049
This is Exile Island.

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,551
Throughout this game, tribe

6
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,969
members will be banished to

7
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:11,261
this island.

8
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,513
The tribes immediately faced

9
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,973
off in their first reward

10
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:15,724
challenge.

11
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,224
>> Yeah.

12
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:16,641
>> Let's get it on.

13
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,560
>> PROBST: The losing tribe will

14
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,771
choose one person to stay behind

15
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,898
on Exile Island right off the

16
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,358
bat.

17
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,068
In a race to find three amulets,

18
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,029
the older men, the younger men,

19
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,406
and the older women were all

20
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,158
winners.

21
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,701
The young women finished last

22
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,912
and chose Misty to stay behind.

23
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,247
>> All right, I'm here.

24
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,874
>> PROBST: And a secret of Exile

25
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,167
Island was revealed.

26
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,044
Hidden somewhere on this island

27
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,838
is an immunity idol.

28
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:47,464
Along the way, you'll be given

29
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,883
clues as to the whereabouts of

30
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,427
that idol.

31
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,512
At the older women's camp, Tina

32
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,723
emerged as a natural leader.

33
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,307
>> Okay, here we go, kids.

34
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,309
Starting a fire was highly

35
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,853
successful.

36
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,645
>> PROBST: The young men

37
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,521
floundered.

38
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,647
>> That is the sorriest shelter

39
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,690
I think we could have possibly

40
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,608
come up with.

41
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,567
>> PROBST: And the younger women

42
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,860
struggled with indecision.

43
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,694
>> Are you feeling it?

44
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,320
>> Next.

45
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,280
>> I started to get a little

46
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,573
bit frustrated with the whole,

47
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,157
like, where we should do the

48
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,116
shelter.

49
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,243
>> PROBST: The older men thrived

50
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,453
>> That's the best-smelling

51
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,788
stinking fire I've seen in a

52
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,121
long time.

53
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,081
>> PROBST: And Dan, the

54
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,333
astronaut, bonded with Terry,

55
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,292
the fighter pilot.

56
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,126
>> I'll shake on that.

57
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,211
>> PROBST: But Shane was on

58
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,086
edge.

59
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,004
>> I smoke three packs of

60
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,089
cigarettes a day, and I haven't

61
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:30,673
had a cigarette in, like, 31

62
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,383
hours.

63
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,471
It is unbelievably hard.

64
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,014
>> PROBST: Alone on Exile

65
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,058
Island, Misty toughed it out...

66
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:40,975
>> I'm hungry.

67
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:41,810
I'm really, really, really

68
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,227
thirsty.

69
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,394
>> PROBST: ...and made a plan.

70
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,562
>> When I see my tribe mates at

71
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,939
the next immunity challenge,

72
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,148
I'll trick them into thinking

73
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,192
that I found the immunity idol.

74
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,693
>> PROBST: Misty returned to her

75
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,488
tribe at the immunity challenge

76
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,864
and helped the younger women

77
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,616
make a comeback.

78
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,118
Younger women have immunity.

79
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,248
Older men win immunity.

80
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,791
Younger men win immunity.

81
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,375
Older women going to Tribal

82
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,961
Council.

83
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,420
Before Tribal Council, Cirie

84
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,839
knew she was in trouble.

85
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,131
>> I'm really nervous.

86
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:12,715
I don't want to be the first

87
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,009
one to go home.

88
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:15,635
>> PROBST: So she campaigned to

89
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:21,933
have Tina voted out.

90
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:22,267
>> Whoa!

91
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,435
>> PROBST: But when Tina found a

92
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,937
fish, the decision was

93
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,980
complicated.

94
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,314
>> I do think that Cirie is the

95
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,107
weak link.

96
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,608
There are a hundred reasons to

97
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,861
keep Tina.

98
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,112
>> PROBST: But at Tribal Council

99
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,196
Tina ruffled feathers when she

100
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,156
criticized her tribe mates.

101
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,366
Do you think these other three

102
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:38,908
are pulling their weight?

103
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,910
>> Not as much as I would like.

104
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,036
>> No offense to Tina, but it's

105
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,162
not like she's out there

106
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:43,788
working and the three of us are

107
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,373
taking a nap.

108
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,583
>> PROBST: In the end, Cirie got

109
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,209
her wish when the older women

110
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,544
voted off their strongest

111
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,461
member.

112
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,381
Tina, the tribe has spoken.

113
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,465
15 are left.

114
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,219
Who will be voted out tonight?

115
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:04,309
Captioning sponsored by

116
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,394
(theme song playing)

117
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:24,996
(thunder)

118
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,456
>> Yo, it's such a drag because

119
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,416
shelter is somewhat useless

120
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,168
because the way the rain is

121
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:30,543
coming.

122
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,377
>> Yeah, how could we have

123
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,462
known?

124
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,636
>> Uh, well, the update is that

125
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,804
we're in a torrential downpour.

126
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,807
And our canopy wasn't completely

127
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,267
built, so we rushed to try and

128
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,227
get the palm fronds on there,

129
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,354
and we did it.

130
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,064
The problem is that the rain is

131
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:51,648
coming in from the other side

132
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,942
now, so a little bit of bad

133
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,652
luck.

134
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,654
This place breeds bad luck.

135
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,574
(thunder cracking)

136
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,732
>> Okay, we're getting close.

137
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:42,615
It's going out.

138
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,825
>> That's no good.

139
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,118
>> We don't have enough stuff

140
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:45,702
right here.

141
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,703
>> I feel like I want to hammer

142
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,204
the freaking thing!

143
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,122
(laughing)

144
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,627
>> Oh, shoot.

145
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,505
>> I got it.

146
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,674
>> That's it, honey.

147
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,300
Come on.

148
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,218
Oh, it's ripe.

149
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,720
Oh, we can eat this right now.

150
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,763
>> Almost.

151
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,681
>> It's going to be so good.

152
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,099
That's just me stabbing it.

153
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,392
>> You rock.

154
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,893
>> Nice job, girl.

155
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,645
>> Yeah!

156
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,730
>> Whoo!

157
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,606
>> I'm so happy.

158
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,191
>> Ta-dah...!

159
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,568
>> Mm, perfect.

160
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,402
>> Cheers.

161
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,445
>><i> Salud.</i>

162
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,529
>><i> Salud.</i>

163
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,572
Papaya love.

164
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:22,905
>> Papaya love.

165
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,116
>> Sisters de bayoneta, our

166
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,453
first papaya.

167
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,913
>> Savor it.

168
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,581
>> I like it soft like that.

169
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,000
It's really juicy.

170
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,295
>> Okay, this is just...

171
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,047
I'm like, wow!

172
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,797
>> Mm...

173
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,257
>> Mm...

174
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,216
>> It's almost orgasmically

175
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,468
wonderful, honestly.

176
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,635
>> Yeah!

177
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,803
>> It's so good.

178
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,429
Oh, it's like heaven.

179
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,848
I'm about to cry.

180
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:54,562
We have food.

181
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,772
>> It looks... it looks bad to

182
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,356
the west, and it looks bad to

183
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,486
the north.

184
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,446
>> You know, I think about

185
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,614
everything that I'm missing

186
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:04,864
right now.

187
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,531
I think about my kid.

188
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,658
I think about, you know, it's

189
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,494
football practice, and we have

190
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:14,040
a game Saturday, and I miss him

191
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,001
so much.

192
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,336
I miss my kid a lot.

193
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,755
I don't, you know, there's no...

194
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:21,464
there's no reason for me to be

195
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,465
doing this.

196
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,259
Like, we are going... I mean, I

197
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,302
more than enough money.

198
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,720
I don't know why I did this to

199
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,888
myself.

200
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,015
>> I don't like you, sand flea.

201
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,642
I don't like flea!

202
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,853
>> This whole scenario is so

203
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,188
different from the way that I

204
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:37,855
live my life.

205
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,440
Like, my life is very busy and

206
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,525
it's always all the time, it's

207
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,194
like constant, like ADD, you

208
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:43,820
know what I mean, psycho boy.

209
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,655
But I'm just... I have a real

210
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,448
hard time with the nothing-to-do

211
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,491
part.

212
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,827
I mean, there's plenty to do,

213
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,245
but it's monotonous, and it's

214
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,788
hard.

215
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,416
It's hard.

216
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,545
No more torrential downpours,

217
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,839
sir God!

218
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:15,685
No more of those!

219
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,855
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

220
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,280
You're getting your first look

221
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,323
at the new group of older women.

222
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:29,866
Tina voted out at the last

223
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,409
Tribal Council.

224
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,327
All right, let's get to it.

225
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,453
Everybody take a spot on the

226
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,288
disk.

227
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:35,872
Men on the light disks, women

228
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,748
on the dark disks.

229
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,417
Your choice.

230
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,461
Find one you like.

231
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,046
Okay, everybody take a step

232
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,257
back, flip over your disk.

233
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,468
If you see a buff, pick it up.

234
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,053
Terry, take a spot over here to

235
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,139
the left.

236
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,682
Danielle, over here to the

237
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,059
right.

238
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,685
Four tribes are about to become

239
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:04,609
two tribes.

240
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,943
Terry, you're the first member

241
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,819
of La Mina.

242
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,112
Danielle, you're the first

243
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:08,613
member of Casaya.

244
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,697
We're going to do a schoolyard

245
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,573
pick.

246
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,450
It doesn't matter who goes

247
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,242
first.

248
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,410
Because a man has to pick a

249
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:14,952
woman, a woman has to pick a

250
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:15,578
man.

251
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,538
Therefore, ladies first.

252
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,250
Danielle, you're choosing a man.

253
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,835
>> The cool guy with the Boston

254
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,462
tattoo.

255
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:24,837
>> The cool guy.

256
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,756

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,341
buff, get rid of yours, put that

258
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:28,758
one on.

259
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,093
Terry, you're picking a woman.

260
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,347
>> Okay, uh... green sweats.

261
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,765
>> PROBST: Sally.

262
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,351
Here's the buffs.

263
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,852
Shane, picking a woman.

264
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,728
>> You're right there, little

265
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,980
lady.

266
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,315

267
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,025

Sally, picking a guy.

269
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,946
>> I'll pick the fast guy, John

270
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,280
Deere hat.

271
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,323
>> PROBST: Austin becomes a

272
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,450
member of La Mina.

273
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,618

275
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,162

277
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,665
Deep sigh of relief to be on a

278
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,583
tribe.

279
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,501
Austin.

280
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,126
>> I'm going to go with Exile

281
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,920
Island over there.

282
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,505
>> PROBST: Misty becomes a

>> Misty.

285
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:10,967
Good to meet you.

286
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,884
>> Good to meet you.

287
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,927

290
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,639
Cirie?

>> PROBST: Okay, only one choice

318
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,093
left.

319
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,761
So, Ruth Marie, you are in

320
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,221
effect, choosing your last

321
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:57,847
tribe member, and also telling

322
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,974
one of these two guys nobody

323
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:07,481
wants him on their tribe.

324
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,775
>> This young man right here.

325
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,651

00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,657
>> PROBST: Okay, so that leaves

330
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,783
you, Bruce.

331
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,035
>> My own tribe.

332
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,785
>> PROBST: How tough would it be

333
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,495
four days in to be going home?

334
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,539
>> I would be really

335
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:24,081
disappointed because I came

336
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,708
here to win.

337
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,335
>> PROBST: Well, not only are

338
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,795
you not going home, you, out of

339
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,965
all 15, are the only person

340
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,884
guaranteed to be safe at the

341
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,635
next Tribal Council.

342
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,304
>> Yeah, thank you!

343
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,597
Whoo!

344
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,848
>> PROBST: The next three days,

345
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,849
you're going to be spending on

346
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,059
Exile Island.

347
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,226
You won't return back to this

348
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,811
game until the next Tribal

349
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,062
Council.

350
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,647
At which point, you will sit in

351
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:48,939
and listen.

352
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,441
>> Oh.

353
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,484
>> PROBST: After that tribe has

354
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,319
voted somebody out, you will

355
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,945
replace that person as the new

356
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,489
member of their tribe and be

357
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,656
back in this game.

358
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,449
>> Wow.

359
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,450
>> PROBST: In addition, there's

360
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,701
still a hidden immunity idol

361
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,702
that may or may not be out

362
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,578
there.

363
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,704
Theoretically, Misty could

364
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,122
already have it.

365
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,040
>> I'm ready for this.

366
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:06,916
>> PROBST: Go.

367
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,751
The boat's out there.

368
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,752
You'll have flint waiting

369
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,796
for you, so you can make a fire.

370
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,881
>> Go, Bruce!

371
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,764
>> PROBST: Okay, two tribes-- La

372
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,308
Mina in orange; Casaya, wearing

373
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:24,809
purple.

374
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,851
Shall we get to today's reward

375
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,894
challenge?

376
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,438
(all agreeing)

377
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,356
>> PROBST: For today's

378
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:30,981
challenge, you are going to race

379
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,775
through an obstacle course,

380
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,859
collecting six wooden snakes

381
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,113
along the way.

382
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,489
One member of your tribe is

383
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,073
responsible for carrying all

384
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,534
six snakes throughout the

385
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:41,951
entire course.

386
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,828
On my "go," you'll make your

387
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,287
way to the first station, where

388
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:45,955
you will collect your first two

389
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,748
snakes.

390
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,833
Once you have those, you'll

391
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,875
crawl under a fence, over a

392
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,003
12-foot A-frame wall.

393
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:53,796
You'll make your way under the

394
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,506
bamboo crawl, grab two more

395
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,590
snakes.

396
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,091
You now have one person

397
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,593
carrying four snakes.

398
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,178
You then go across a ladder

399
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,179
bridge.

400
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,222
If you fall off the bridge, you

401
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,390
got to go back to the start

402
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,391
and go again.

403
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,934
For the last phase, you go

404
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,727
through the water and into a pit

405
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,563
of leaves, where you must find

406
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,606
the last two snakes.

407
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,649
First tribe to cross the finish

408
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,484
line with all six snakes wins

409
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,444
reward.

410
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,319
You want to know what you're

411
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:17,987
playing for?

412
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,322
>> Yeah!

413
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,365
>> PROBST: Fishing gear.

414
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,908
>> Beautiful!

415
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,535
>> PROBST: In addition, waiting

416
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,662
for you at camp, one raft, four

417
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,247
paddles to go with it.

418
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,331
Should help you trying to

419
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,416
get some food.

420
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,459
Worth playing for?

421
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:31,792
>> Yeah.

422
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,376
>> Definitely.

423
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,127
>> PROBST: All right, let's take

424
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,919
our spots.

425
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,504
We'll get started.

426
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,094
La Mina, who is going to be

427
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,429
your snake wrangler?

428
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,180
Nick.

429
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,432
For Casaya, Courtney.

430
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,058
Here we go, for reward.

431
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,811
Survivors ready?

432
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,104
Go!

433
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:56,984
Both tribes pushing people up

434
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,111
quickly.

435
00:12:59,195 --> 00:12:59,904
You've got to get the untied,

436
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,907
and one person is carrying them.

437
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,950
Danielle and Courtney have the

438
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,870
first snake untied for Casaya.

439
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,916
La Mina has their first snake.

440
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,918
Sally has the second snake for

441
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,628
La Mina.

442
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,922
Both tribes have both snakes.

443
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,007
Got to get everybody on the mat.

444
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,050
La Mina, go!

445
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,135
Casaya, go!

446
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,099
Both tribes are dead even.

447
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,101
When you have all seven over to

448
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,771
the other side, you can go.

449
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,981
>> Go, go, go!

450
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,900
>> Go!

451
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,859
>> PROBST: Carry those snakes.

452
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,695
That a way.

453
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,532
Casaya, go!

454
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,699
Two more snakes to collect on

455
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,701
your way through.

456
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,787
Both tribes pretty even.

457
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,708
Both snakes are free for La

458
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,126
Mina.

459
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,212
Both snakes are free for Casaya.

460
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,884
La Mina, go!

461
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,512
Casaya, go!

462
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,057
>> Take your time.

463
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,684
>> PROBST: Shane falls off,

464
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,644
heads back to the start.

465
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,895
This is going to be a challenge

466
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,647
for the snake wranglers.

467
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,940
It's a lot to handle.

468
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,025
Nick's across.

469
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,279
Move on!

470
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,071
Courtney's across.

471
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,156
Go!

472
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,661
Last stage.

473
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,746
We are neck and neck again.

474
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,415
Two snakes left buried in the

475
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,124
leaves.

476
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,209
>> Got one!

477
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:39,670
>> PROBST: Terry's got his hands

478
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,131
on one.

479
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,632
>> Got one, got one, got one.

480
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,758
>> PROBST: Aras has a snake

481
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,469
for Casaya.

482
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,180
>> I got it, I got it!

483
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,265
>> PROBST: Dan's released the

484
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,099
sixth one for La Mina.

485
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,809
They've got 'em all.

486
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,977
You got to get all six across

487
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,062
the finish.

488
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,067
La Mina wins reward!

489
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,236
>> Yeah!

490
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:14,622
>> PROBST: Casaya, you guys

491
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,080
worked well together.

492
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,832
I don't even think you were

493
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:17,750
out-hustled.

494
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,751
You just loss.

495
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,918
I got nothing for you.

496
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,544
You're heading back to the

497
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,046
Casaya beach, previously the

498
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,589
older women's camp.

499
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,089
Head on out.

500
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,966
La Mina, nice effort, won

501
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,385
yourself a nice reward.

502
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,094
Come get it, head on out,

503
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,097
heading to the older men's camp.

504
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,988
>> It looks like a nice camp.

505
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:48,572
>> Yeah, this camp is so much

506
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,366
nicer than ours.

507
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,284
We didn't stop working.

508
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,507
I'm in a much better mood than

509
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,258
I was this morning.

510
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,468
I've always related better with

511
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,052
younger people.

512
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,095
I'm 34, but I'm definitely

513
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,596
young for my age in the way

514
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,722
that I think about life.

515
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,306
When I was at the older tribe,

516
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,849
I was thinking about every

517
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,433
single minute about when I was

518
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,227
gonna be leaving.

519
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,105
Here I haven't thought about,

520
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,940
you know what I mean, I

521
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:23,732
haven't thought about leaving

522
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,734
yet.

523
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,985
>> Do you all want to see your

524
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,236
new home?

525
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,030
>> We have not been wet at all.

526
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,031
>> I'm so impressed.

527
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:31,824
Why?

528
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,283
This is how we made ours.

529
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:33,534
>> Wow!

530
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,160
>> You see this, Bob?

531
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,161
>> We can add a little bit more

532
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,538
on this side to make it wider,

533
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,580
maybe.

534
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,039
>> How are the bugs?

535
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,999
>> Not bad.

536
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,625
>> You guys, this is definitely

537
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,210
the best spot for that.

538
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,671
>> You guys are awesome, man!

539
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,631
>> It's so great.

540
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,799
We're going to have fun.

541
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,175
>> This is so much better.

542
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,427
I'm so excited.

543
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,886
>> Oh, my God.

544
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,555
We have been invaded.

545
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,765
>> Fire!

546
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,893
Way to go, way to go, way to go.

547
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,811
I like our name.

548
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,062
I like our color.

549
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,439
I like our people.

550
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,149
First and foremost...

551
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,151
>> I mean, some of the people,

552
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,485
like Danielle, she's okay, and

553
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,237
Courtney, like, I mean, you

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,905
know, like, she, like...

555
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:12,281
>> I'm, like...

00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,951
I'm, like, gangster Hollywood,

557
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:16,910
man.

558
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,078
I'm like near like<i> Playboy,</i>

559
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,079
liquor and stuff.

560
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,789
I'm, like, where the Hill

561
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,416
starts to rise, you know?

562
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,419
I can walk to Avalon.

563
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,628
>> It's like that game where

564
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,671
you have to figure out what

565
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,716
doesn't belong in a group, and

566
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,300
Cirie and I are the ones that

567
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,177
stick out.

568
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,928
>> it's so fun having so many

569
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,429
more people.

570
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,472
>> It's fun for me having girls

571
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:36,680
around.

572
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,015
I like having girls around.

573
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,683
>> If our tribe loses the

574
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,226
coming-up immunity challenge, I

575
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,480
think Cirie and I are screwed.

576
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,234
Yep, we're screwed.

577
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,154
>> I just have to get the

578
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,615
heat and now I'm happy.

579
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,741
>> What?

580
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,867
>> Yo, you, it's the three of

581
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,743
us.

582
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,369
It's the three of us and Aras.

583
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,204
>> Totally.

584
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,246
>> The four of us.

585
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,581
>> Here's the deal.

586
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,833
Can we not make it dramatic

587
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,876
and like cheat on each other

588
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,586
five people in, just the four of

589
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,546
us go to the four, done?

590
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,255
No more discussion about it.

591
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,591
If I just can get through this

592
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,510
part, which is the surviving,

593
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
and do well in the challenges,

594
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,096
we're going to be fine.

595
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,722
I got on the beach, and I was

596
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,098
right there.

597
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:20,682
I was like here it is, you,

598
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,017
you, you, you, let's lock

599
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,937
in right now.

600
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,729
You've just been welcomed into

601
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,190
the group.

602
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,358
I swear to you on my son's

603
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,609
life...

604
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,110
It's us four.

605
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:38,408
>> Yeah, totally, 100%.

606
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,953
>> For Shane, the first five

607
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,955
minutes we were there, he was

608
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,248
just like, "us four."

609
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,501
me, Shane, Aras and Courtney.

610
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,836
The people that don't talk and

611
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,920
communicate and see what's

612
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,004
going on and see how people

613
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:51,588
are feeling and look people in

614
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,173
the eye, they're the ones who

615
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,300
get voted off.

616
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,011
>> No way!

617
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,930
>> Oh, my God!

618
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,473
>> This is so awesome.

619
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,224
>> This is really nice.

620
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,392
>> Let's make sure we get some

621
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,060
poles, though.

622
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,271
I am thrilled with this outcome.

623
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,272
It was a close call for me.

624
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,858
I was the 15th guy picked, but

625
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,483
Ruth Marie did pick me, and this

626
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,902
was the team I definitely

627
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,236
wanted to be on.

628
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,990
>> Oh, fire!

629
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,491
It feels so good.

630
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,742
Thank you so much for letting

631
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,910
us come here.

632
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,578
>> Terry and I have a fantastic

633
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,163
relationship and a strategy

634
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,415
that's going to take us all the

635
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,291
way.

636
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:32,546
So it's great.

637
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,213
>> Dan and I were talking that

638
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,257
we'd like to make a bond with

639
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,135
you guys, look each other in the

640
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,679
eye, shake hands, and say, you

641
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,305
know, we're going to do our

642
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,348
best to get everyone to the

643
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,058
merge, but if we have to start

644
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,476
dropping people it's not going

645
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,227
to be one of us four guys.

646
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,563
>> It's in our best interest,

647
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,522
probably.

648
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,732
>> You have my word, you know,

649
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,442
you have my word, definitely.

650
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,359
>> What do you think?

651
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,527
>> It makes a lot of sense.

652
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,820
Terry just laid it out there.

653
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,155
He said him and Dan are together

654
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,281
and they want Austin and I with

655
00:19:59,364 --> 00:19:59,489
them.

656
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,658
I think that him and Dan are

657
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,826
both strong players, both in the

658
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,410
challenges and around camp.

659
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,870
>> It's done.

660
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,454
>> Okay, thanks a lot, man.

661
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,039
>> Trust you, and I need you.

662
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:07,623
>> I trust you and I need you.

663
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,082
If we're gonna do this, I need

664
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:09,416
you.

665
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:09,958
>> We're gonna do this, all

666
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,500
right.

667
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,585
>> It makes sense for the short

668
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,669
term in the tribe.

669
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,503
The four of us really have

670
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,463
nothing to worry about with the

671
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,714
majority over the three women.

672
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,215
But, I don't know, you never

673
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,675
know what's going to happen.

674
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,177
>> So let's talk strategy for a

675
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,427
minute.

676
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,597
I talked to Misty a little bit,

677
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,058
and we were thinking if the

678
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,476
four of us stuck together,

679
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,979
meaning you and Nick, we would

680
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,272
have the numbers, and then it

681
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,649
feels kind of even because it's

682
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,983
you know, two girls, two guys,

683
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,026
and we can figure it out from

684
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,277
there, you know?

685
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,113
We would definitely want to vote

686
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,490
with you guys if you wanted to.

687
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:41,698
>> Okay.

688
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,034
>> So talk to Nick when you can.

689
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:44,952
>> All right, I will.

690
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,827
Cool.

691
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,579
It is definitely Austin and

692
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,956
Nick in the middle right now.

693
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,123
We are right in the middle of a

694
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,124
tug-of-war.

695
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,125
It lets me know that this game

696
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:52,834
is serious.

697
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,044
This isn't just all fun and

698
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:54,294
games.

699
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:54,836
Somebody is going to have to

700
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:09,726
get hurt out here.

701
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,978
>> "Clue one, day one.

702
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:11,520
You also have a lot of time

703
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,356
to think about why fate chose

704
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,566
you to be the first one out

705
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,151
here."

706
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,737
"Clue two, it is above the tide

707
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,822
line."

708
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,865
I read the clue.

709
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,409
The clue just showed me a

710
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,077
little section where the idol

711
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,369
is not.

712
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,038
Also it said it's above the

713
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,290
tide mark.

714
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:32,874
So I figured right against the

715
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,793
cliff someplace.

716
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,836
I'm going to be ripping this

717
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,213
island apart, and I'm going to

718
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:38,714
find that immunity idol.

719
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,506
That's where I'm going to put

720
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,591
most of my energy, after I get

721
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,969
the fire set up.

722
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,595
And it's a little bit miserable.

723
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,475
Inconvenience, that's all it is.

724
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,856
(murmuring)

725
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,608
It's all worn out.

726
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,452
(yells)

727
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,995
>> My practice will

728
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,289
really help me clear my mind,

729
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,583
focus, get my mind ready, like

730
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,584
for battle.

731
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,710
And then I get my mind ready

732
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,544
the same way to be on this

733
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,504
island.

734
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,472
>> This place is, like,

735
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,058
horrible, evil...

736
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,851
It's like not good to be here.

737
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,477
I would not wish this on my

738
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,604
worst enemy.

739
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,564
(thunderclap)

740
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,242
>> All right, I'm gonna go catch

741
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,202
us dinner.

742
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,244
>> Are you going to do the spear

743
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,245
and the goggles?

744
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,246
>> I never used one of those.

745
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,247
>> I haven't either.

746
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,248
We'll have to experiment with

747
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,249
that a little bit.

748
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,250
>> Yeah, let's play with it.

749
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,795
>> At the reward challenge, we

750
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,463
won fishing gear: spear gun,

751
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,007
hooks, tackle, a couple of drop

752
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,634
lines, fins and a mask and the

753
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,136
raft.

754
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,346
So it's pretty exciting.

755
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,806
It will be nice to get out

756
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,431
there and bring in some fish

757
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,517
for everybody.

758
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,017
Just point at the fish,

759
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,520
hopefully, and there you go.

760
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,813
>> That's kind of fun.

761
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,106
>> Just remember to hold on to

762
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,566
it.

763
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,111
>> I saw some fish just right

764
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,862
over there.

765
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:26,988
Look at them!

766
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:27,489
>> That's amazing.

767
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,782
Should we toss in a line?

768
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,825
>> Let's just see what it's

769
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,200
like down here.

770
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,409
>> Yeah, might as well.

771
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:38,750
We've paddled enough.

772
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,501
I was sitting on the edge of

773
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,087
the raft, and I decided I'm

774
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,588
going to try the spear, and I'm

775
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,673
like, oh, this will be a

776
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,340
practice shot.

777
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,342
So you...

778
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,511
Oh!

779
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,516
>> Uh-oh.

780
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,393
>> The first time I attempted to

781
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,728
use that stupid spear, it flew

782
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,647
off my arm, and I dove down,

783
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,650
and it was so deep.

784
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,152
>> Any sign of it?

785
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,070
>> I should have stuck to what

786
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,029
I knew.

787
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,364
>> That's all right.

788
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,615
Is it down 30, 40 feet,

789
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,449
probably?

790
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,450
>> I can't see anything.

791
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,451
>> Don't, like, stress out.

792
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,578
Don't, like, hurt yourself.

793
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,878
>> Nick was cool about it.

794
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,670
He was like just don't worry

795
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,588
about it, but I was really

796
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,547
nervous to come back and tell

797
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,548
the rest of the tribe.

798
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,591
I have some bad news.

799
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,427
>> What?

800
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,471
>> I lost that spear.

801
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,390
It was so... it was stupid.

802
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,349
>> Did it fall over or

803
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,893
something or fell through?

804
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,894
>> I'm so sorry.

805
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,895
>> Did you try to go back with

806
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,896
the mask?

807
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,897
>> It was so deep, I couldn't

808
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,898
get down there.

809
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,775
>> We were out about 100 yards,

810
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,111
probably 30, 40 feet of water.

811
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,571
>> I was very frustrated about

812
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,572
the spear.

813
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,199
I have no doubt in my mind we

814
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:52,824
would be eating tons of fish if

815
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,743
we had that spear.

816
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,286
>> I lost our spear.

817
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,287
I feel terrible.

818
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,288
>> Don't worry. We'll make...

819
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,291
We can make one.

820
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,885
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

821
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,893
Okay, how is everybody doing?

822
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,894
Misty, how're you hanging in

823
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:21,895
there?

824
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:22,896
>> Pretty good.

825
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:23,897
The good part about our team is

826
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,898
we're all very upbeat.

827
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,899
And that's kind of our rule:

828
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,900
Don't get down and out; just be

829
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,901
thankful and stay positive.

830
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:28,902
>> PROBST: Casaya, how are

831
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,903
things going for you?

832
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:30,904
>> I don't know how people

833
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:31,905
want to feel about stuff, but

834
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,906
I'm not gonna lie.

835
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:33,907
We are in a dire situation.

836
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,533
And you know, the whole like

837
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,910
"Ooh, let's act like we're

838
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,744
doing all right, so the other

839
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,372
tribe thinks we're..."

840
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,706
You know what I mean?

841
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,333
Screw that, we are not in a

842
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,460
good way.

843
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,630
Physically, we're wrecked.

844
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,298
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to

845
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:50,715
today's challenge.

846
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,968
Here's how it works: today's

847
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,427
immunity challenge will test

848
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,845
your ability to work together

849
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,639
while transporting a giant

850
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,225
zombie head from the ocean to

851
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,226
the beach.

852
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,103
Each tribe has a boat.

853
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,396
That boat is anchored to the

854
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,647
bottom of the ocean floor with a

855
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,565
large wooden box.

856
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,943
In addition, each boat has six

857
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,696
holes, filled with rubber plugs.

858
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,656
On my "Go," five tribe members

859
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,574
pull out the plugs and begin

860
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,493
bailing the water that is now

861
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,452
coming in the boat.

862
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:19,995
The other two tribe members

863
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,247
jump into the water, start

864
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:22,789
moving the boat forward by

865
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,166
pulling the anchor, which is

866
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,251
very heavy.

867
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:26,835
Once you get to shore, clip

868
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,837
your boat into the hitching

869
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,546
post.

870
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,256
You must now transport the

871
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,174
anchor up the beach to your

872
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:33,758
finish mat.

873
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,844
The first tribe to get their

874
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,387
zombie head on the zombie body

875
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,805
wins immunity, safe from Tribal

876
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,806
Council.

877
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,807
Losers, somebody going home

878
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,808
tonight; big enough stakes?

879
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,559
>> Yes.

880
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,184
>> PROBST: Swim out, we'll get

881
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,313
started.

882
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,400
For immunity...

883
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,695
Survivors ready?

884
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,488
Go!

885
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,490
Aras in the water for Casaya.

886
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,660
Bobby's right behind.

887
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:04,956
Going to have to work together

888
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,167
to keep that water out of the

889
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,794
boat!

890
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,089
Terry and Nick in the water for

891
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,175
La Mina.

892
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,772
Casaya's going backwards.

893
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,066
Nick and Austin going to switch

894
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,818
it up for La Mina.

895
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,455
>> PROBST: Bobby and Shane

896
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,791
swapping out for Casaya.

897
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,466
Shane made zero progress in the

898
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,758
water.

899
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,260
La Mina still in the lead but

900
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,261
only because Casaya is

901
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,347
absolutely inept.

902
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,186
Casaya switching out members

903
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,772
again.

904
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,149
>> You take the back.

905
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,235
I'll take the front.

906
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,577
>> PROBST: Casaya making up some

907
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,787
ground.

908
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,788
>> Go, let's go!

909
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,789
>> PROBST: Casaya getting

910
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,790
closer.

911
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,875
La Mina, got to pick it up!

912
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,300
Terry pulling that anchor in.

913
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,301
La Mina's first back to the

914
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,302
beach.

915
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,388
Casaya not giving up.

916
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,517
Get that anchor to the shore.

917
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,477
Get that boat clipped in.

918
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,854
>> Pull!

919
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,605
>> PROBST: The boat is stuck.

920
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,692
La Mina trying to muscle it in.

921
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,694
Still a few inches short.

922
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,237
Casaya starting to close the

923
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,530
gap.

924
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,407
Misty's got it clipped!

925
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:02,991
The boat is done.

926
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,243
Get the anchor to the finish

927
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,077
mat.

928
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,162
>> Pull.

929
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,163
>> Come on, come on!

930
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,666
>> Come on, hurry!

931
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,961
(indistinct shouts)

932
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,216
>> PROBST: Casaya still has a

933
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,092
shot.

934
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,094
La Mina very close.

935
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,929
(indistinct shouts)

936
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,974
You're good.

937
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,518
Get the head on the body for

938
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,895
immunity.

939
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,021
>> Get closer.

940
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,022
>> You got it.

941
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,023
>> PROBST: La Mina wins

942
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,024
immunity!

943
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,069
(cheering)

944
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,071
(muttering)

945
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,245
La Mina, immunity.

946
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,246
>> Whoo-whoo!

947
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:50,872
>> PROBST: No Tribal Council.

948
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,957
Congratulations.

949
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,710
Casaya, Tribal Council tonight.

950
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,086
It's going to cost you a member.

951
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,087
You have the afternoon to

952
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,255
figure out who that's going to

953
00:29:59,339 --> 00:29:59,756
be.

954
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,258
See you at Tribal tonight.

955
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,114
>> Whenever there's a

956
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,658
competition of any sort, I don't

957
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,743
like to lose, you know, I just,

958
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,119
uh, I hate to lose anything.

959
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,121
I'm beat. I'm wiped-out.

960
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:32,872
I want a cigarette.

961
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:33,915
I want a coffee.

962
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,042
I want to have a big sandwich.

963
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,252
I want to call my kid.

964
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,545
I want to tell him I love him

965
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,546
and this is just the stupidest

966
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,088
thing I ever did in my whole

967
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:40,880
life.

968
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,300
I am not well without him.

969
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,303
I'm not well without him.

970
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,101
>> Shane, what are you doing?

971
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,395
>> It's not what I'm doing or

972
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:55,937
what I'm not doing.

973
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,523
I'm telling you, I can't finish.

974
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,525
I'm gonna quit. I have to quit.

975
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,526
>> Come on.

976
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,527
>> It only gets better from

977
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,528
here, we're gonna win food...

978
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,529
>> Really, just give it a

979
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,656
chance, please.

980
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,866
Don't fall down on this moment.

981
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,909
>> What's up?

982
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,536
>> He's just not feeling so

983
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:11,911
good right now.

984
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,414
>> Emotionally? Physically?

985
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,415
>> I just, you know, I don't

986
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,749
want to be here anymore.

987
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,251
Like, I really just want you

988
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,711
guys to vote me off.

989
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,086
>> That's nuts.

990
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,338
>> We need you, man.

991
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:22,964
I mean, you're dropping on us,

992
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:23,923
too, you know that, right?

993
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,175
>> I'm not dropping on you guys.

994
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,302
>> Yeah, you are.

995
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,720
Shane is letting us down

996
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,929
completely.

997
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,556
He's leaving us high and dry,

998
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,099
and I just feel like he snapped

999
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,059
today and threw in the towel.

1000
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,394
I mean, it's just like, come

1001
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:55,204
on, man, pick it up!

1002
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,205
>> Where is he?

1003
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,582
>> Just when we thought it was

1004
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,752
over, Shane wants to quit.

1005
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,961
Aahh!

1006
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,172
You have people begging to stay

1007
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,506
here.

1008
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,717
If somebody wants to quit, let

1009
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,718
him quit.

1010
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,719
>> So you, basically this is

1011
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,136
what'll happen.

1012
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,137
You're gonna, you know, we're

1013
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,013
gonna be here.

1014
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,223
We're going to have water.

1015
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,517
And we're going to have food

1016
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,518
tomorrow, you'll be set.

1017
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,519
And we'll be eating not like a

1018
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,355
champion...

1019
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,689
>> I don't want to be here.

1020
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,357
>> Are you sure?

1021
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,775
>> I'm positive. I'm positive.

1022
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,150
I'm sorry.

1023
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,152
>> Shane, come back here.

1024
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,153
You-You know that thought was

1025
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,155
in your head.

1026
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,156
>> I just don't want to, like,

1027
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,157
if I get hydrated, and I get

1028
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,494
food...

1029
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,797
>> Just try it. Okay?

1030
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,631
>> Okay. All right.

1031
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,632
>> Just 'cause it's not like I

1032
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,384
can do anything.

1033
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,427
>> I know, but...

1034
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,138
>> We can just bring it up

1035
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,974
right now.

1036
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,101
Hey, guys, I hate to be the one

1037
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,478
to bring this up...

1038
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,521
>> Oh, no.

1039
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,855
>> But Shane wants to stay.

1040
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,524
He doesn't want to go home.

1041
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,442
>> I'm really sorry about my,

1042
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,236
like, insanity flip-flop today.

1043
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,029
It's like there's no reason why

1044
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,989
I shouldn't try and stay.

1045
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,658
I haven't had water in two days.

1046
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,785
It's like, if I drink, I might

1047
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,786
feel better in my brain and in

1048
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,787
my head, and I might want to

1049
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,539
stay, you know what I mean?

1050
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,540
So like...

1051
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,125
>> And so now we have to talk

1052
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,127
about who we're going to vote

1053
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,670
off.

1054
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,088
So, I'm... I just want to do

1055
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,132
this with honesty and like

1056
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,718
openness, and-and where I stand

1057
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,344
here is, like, I want our tribe

1058
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,679
to be as physically strong as

1059
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,680
possible.

1060
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,057
So, I think, like, for me, I

1061
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,059
per... and this is nothing

1062
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,645
against you two, either one, but

1063
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,271
I'm going to throw my vote

1064
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,189
either with you or you.

1065
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,524
And I haven't decided yet.

1066
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,775
Cirie, you're looking at me

1067
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,776
like you hate me, and I...

1068
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,777
>> No, I just don't...

1069
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,778
What do you want me...

1070
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,779
I don't know what to say about

1071
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,865
that.

1072
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,160
>> Well, since you just dropped

1073
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,162
this bomb on here, seriously...

1074
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,163
>> I just wanted... I just

1075
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,164
wanted to put it out there.

1076
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,081
>> Jason just dropped a huge

1077
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,082
bomb, like, boom!

1078
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,083
>> I don't want anyone to show

1079
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,084
up at Tribal Council and have

1080
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,085
their back stabbed.

1081
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,086
>> Aras literally came over to

1082
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,423
the shelter, not having spoken

1083
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,841
to anyone about what he was

1084
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,801
about to do, and he said, "Cirie

1085
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,802
or Melinda are going to go home

1086
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,804
tonight."

1087
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,181
It was so stupid.

1088
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,307
And it was his decision.

1089
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,308
He just came over and was like,

1090
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,310
"Boop!"

1091
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,519
>> There's been an arrangement

1092
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,228
obviously made.

1093
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,563
What he said sounded insincere.

1094
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,147
I don't know what to tell you.

1095
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,900
Like, I don't care which one of

1096
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:29,901
you goes.

1097
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,902
You know what I mean?

1098
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,694
I just don't...

1099
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,737
Like, whoever doesn't go now

1100
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,279
is going next.

1101
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,491
>> And then Shane piped in, you

1102
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,117
know, that yeah, it's the four

1103
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,578
of us, like literally just said

1104
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,245
right out loud that we have an

1105
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,121
alliance.

1106
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,915
You don't let...

1107
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,166
You don't tell everyone what's

1108
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:45,458
going on.

1109
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,544
If this total instability

1110
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,922
continues, it's going to be

1111
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,006
very hard to know that he will

1112
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:54,091
be there for us.

1113
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,182
>> We're screwed.

1114
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,517
I think it's me.

1115
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,936
I think it's me, and whatever.

1116
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,063
There's nothing I can do right

1117
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,064
now.

1118
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,900
I'm going to stop... (mumbles.)

1119
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,735
>> I don't know who's going to

1120
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,736
go first.

1121
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,904
Cirie seems to think she'll go

1122
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,073
first, but I-I'm not so sure

1123
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,074
that it won't be me.

1124
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,494
>> I... I feel so awful.

1125
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,495
I don't like this.

1126
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,580
>> (crying): Yeah, there's a lot

1127
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,289
about it that's not fair.

1128
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,042
There really is.

1129
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,336
I was the last one picked of

1130
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,338
our group, so that's one reason

1131
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,340
that I think it might be me.

1132
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,299
And I'm not all, "Ooh,

1133
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,301
meditative, cool, yeah."

1134
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:43,724
That's just not me.

1135
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,143
>> I mean, it's one or the

1136
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,144
other at this point.

1137
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:47,728
Cirie and Melinda are going to

1138
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,188
go one-two, whatever, you know.

1139
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,190
They're the first two to go.

1140
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,609
The thing I don't feel safe

1141
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,277
about is my brain giving up.

1142
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,319
Like, I have this part of me

1143
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,320
that wants to go into Tribal

1144
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,321
Council tonight and just say,

1145
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,322
"Listen, cut me out, because

1146
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,323
I don't, I don't want to be here

1147
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:15,506
anymore."

1148
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,382
>> PROBST: For those of you who

1149
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,508
don't have torches, there's one

1150
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,509
behind you.

1151
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,510
Go ahead and grab it and

1152
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,511
approach the flame, dip it in

1153
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,972
and get fire.

1154
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,267
This is part of the ritual at

1155
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,310
Tribal Council, because in this

1156
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,479
game, fire represents your life.

1157
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,898
As long as you have fire,

1158
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,065
you're in the game.

1159
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,483
When the fire is gone, so are

1160
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,318
you.

1161
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,112
We'll now bring in Bruce from

1162
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:41,616
Exile Island.

1163
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,786
During Tribal Council, Bruce is

1164
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,580
just listening in, trying to

1165
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,873
get a gauge of the tribe

1166
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,957
dynamics.

1167
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,500
Once the vote's over, he will

1168
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,044
join this tribe, go back to

1169
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,254
camp with you guys.

1170
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,548
Shane, you made no bones about

1171
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,175
it at the challenge today.

1172
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,176
You said, "Jeff, I'm not going

1173
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,177
to pretend for the other tribe

1174
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,178
that everything's fine.

1175
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,179
It's miserable."

1176
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,180
>> Yeah, it's the worst thing

1177
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:04,805
that has ever happened to me in

1178
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,264
my entire life.

1179
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,308
Like I wanted to quit.

1180
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,684
I wanted them all to write my

1181
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,977
name down and I wanted to leave

1182
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,313
here because I couldn't get out

1183
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,357
of the mania of dehydration,

1184
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,859
not being able to eat, and on

1185
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,985
top of that, I smoke three

1186
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,445
packs of cigarettes a day, and

1187
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,530
quit the day I got here, so

1188
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,491
I'm in the midst of this insane

1189
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,201
withdrawal from that, and I was

1190
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,202
done.

1191
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,328
I wanted out of here.

1192
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,704
>> PROBST: So is this like a

1193
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,830
detox for you?

1194
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,456
>> It's like, it's some kind of

1195
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,794
psychotic, bad-idea detox.

1196
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,045
(laughter)

1197
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,713
>> PROBST: Cirie, let's talk

1198
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,839
about what's going on at camp

1199
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,590
life.

1200
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,217
>> I think for the most part,

1201
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,551
everybody was okay with

1202
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,971
everyone else, up until today.

1203
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,305
>> PROBST: What happened today?

1204
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,224
>> Well, no matter how happy

1205
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,142
you try to be, it's hard to

1206
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,894
stay like that when you're

1207
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,230
told, "It's us four," and

1208
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,148
that's basically what it was.

1209
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,316
And either one of y'all are

1210
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,317
going to go home today.

1211
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,318
It's hurtful.

1212
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,445
I mean, I'm human.

1213
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,698
>> Especially when I think in

1214
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,490
the challenges that we have

1215
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,741
competed together in the team.

1216
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,742
I don't think that there's

1217
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,744
anything that Cirie or I did or

1218
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,037
didn't do that they have

1219
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,038
point... that they could point

1220
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,415
out to and say, "You should

1221
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,791
have done that better."

1222
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:14,333
>> PROBST: So if it's you

1223
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,377
tonight, just the way it goes?

1224
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,629
>> No.

1225
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,214
I mean, I'm disappointed.

1226
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,424
I'm pissed.

1227
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,426
I'm... hurt.

1228
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,052
It bothers me when somebody

1229
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,804
even remotely had the thought

1230
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,015
to quit, and you have me here

1231
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,268
who is trying my best to stay.

1232
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,062
>> PROBST: Cirie, if it's you

1233
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,480
tonight, six days is not bad.

1234
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,526
>> Six days isn't bad, but the

1235
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,445
disappointment that my family

1236
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,405
would have is bad.

1237
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,365
>> PROBST: Why would they be

1238
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,366
disappointed in you?

1239
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,454
You're giving it your all.

1240
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,626
>> My family might not be

1241
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,419
disappointed, but I will be

1242
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,546
disappointed for them,

1243
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,131
because part of the reason I

1244
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,424
come... came here was to help

1245
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,053
them, so...

1246
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,138
They probably wouldn't be, um,

1247
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:14,518
disappointed... but I would.

1248
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,564
>> PROBST: To me, this tribe

1249
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,900
seems a little all over the map.

1250
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:21,859
I'm curious to see how it plays

1251
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:22,860
out.

1252
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:23,861
It is time to vote.

1253
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,947
Cirie, you're up.

1254
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,043
>> (whispering): Shane, you made

1255
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:39,668
me promise that I would vote for

1256
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,047
you, and I don't go back on a

1257
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,132
promise.

1258
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,727
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1259
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,813
votes.

1260
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:07,822
Once the votes are read, the

1261
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,614
decision is final.

1262
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,615
The person voted out will be

1263
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,616
asked to leave Tribal Council

1264
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,617
area immediately.

1265
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,120
I'll read the votes.

1266
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,372
First vote...

1267
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,793
Shane.

1268
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,795
Shane.

1269
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:26,674
Two votes Shane.

1270
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,466
Melinda.

1271
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,470
One vote Melinda.

1272
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,930
Melinda.

1273
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:33,931
That's two votes Shane, two

1274
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,268
votes Melinda.

1275
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,020
Three votes Melinda, two votes

1276
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,942
Shane.

1277
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,193
Second person voted out of

1278
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,945
Survivor Exile Island: Melinda.

1279
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,113
That's four, that's enough.

1280
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,198
You need to bring me your torch.

1281
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,626
Melinda, the tribe has spoken.

1282
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,963
It's time for you to go.

1283
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,048
>> Take care.

1284
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,558

1285
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,559
buff.

Join your new tribe, Casaya.

1287
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,522
>> How are you doing?

1288
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,610
Yeah, brother.

1289
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,527
Hey, brother.

1290
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,821
>> PROBST: Here's your buff.

1291
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,115
Grab your torches.

1292
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:33,574
Head back to camp.

1293

>> I just found myself on the

1318
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,162
tribe that's like, "Hey, man,

1319
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,040
yo, dude, what's up?"

1320
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:23,749
And that's just not me.

1321
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,210
It won't ever be me, nor do I

1322
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,503
think I want it to be me, so I

1323
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,339
just wish Cirie luck because I

1324
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,340
know she didn't want to go back

1325
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,341
there without me.

1326
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,342
It's just going to be hell.

1327
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,343
But I'm going to have a shower,

1328
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,344
and I'm going to drink water,

1329
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,429
and I'm going to eat food!
