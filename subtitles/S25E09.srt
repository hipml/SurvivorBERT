A RETURNING PLAYER OUT NEXT.

PENNURE DOWN TO TWO PIECES.

28
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,133
PENNER WINS IMMUNITY.

29
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,385
PENNER WON IMMUNITY AND LISA

30
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,220
DECIDED TO MAKE A BIG MOVE

31
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,264
ATTEMPTING TO SAVE SKUPIN.

00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,605
AND HIS IDOL UNDER THE BUS.

36
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,939
>> EVERYBODY IS GOING MAD IN THE

37
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,690
PAST HOUR.

38
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,525
IF THIS THING EVEN SEEMSCROSE

39
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,860
I'M PLAYING IT.

40
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,235
>> .

41
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,781
>> I PUT MY FAITH IN A LITTLE

42
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,949
TEXAS GIRL AND SHE THROUGH ME

43
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:15,366
UNDER THE BUS.

44
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,743
>> I THINK THIS IS LUDICROUS.

45
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,037
AND MALCOLM WAS WAY SLONGENER

46
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,872
OUR ALLIANCE THAN SKUPIN EVER

47
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:21,039
WAS.

48
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,040
>> Jeff: AND IT BECAME CLEAR

49
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,460
THERE WERE TWO MAJOR ALLIANCES.

50
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,629
THERE IS THE TANDANG FIVE, AND

51
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,799
THEN THERE IS THEICAL BOW FOUR

52
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,593
AND MALCOLM, EACH WITH THEIR OWN

53
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:33,927
IMMUNITY IDOL.

54
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,969
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

55
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,639
>> Jeff: IN THE END, TANDANG

56
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,932
STAYED AND GOT THEIR WAY.

57
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,099
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

58
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,851
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

59
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,018
JEFF.

60
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,394
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

61
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,730
NINE ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED

62
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:59,577
OUT TONIGHT.

63
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,747
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS THE MOST

64
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,374
AMAZING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE LISA

65
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,168
MADE HER BIG MOVE TO SAVE ME.

66
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:12,090
SO GOING FROM "IT'S YOU" TO

67
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,508
"IT'S NOT YOU" IN THE MATTER OF

68
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,051
FIVE MINUTES IS A SENSE OF

69
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:15,260
RELIEF.

70
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,678
I MEAN, THE GAME COULD HAVE BEEN

71
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,929
FLIPPED AROUND WITH ONE OR TWO

72
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,597
MORE VOTES FOR PETE, BUT WHETHER

73
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,976
PETE WENT OR WHETHER JEFF WENT,

74
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,811
THEY'RE BOTH THE TWO MOST

75
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,979
OUTSPOKEN PEOPLE ABOUT GETTING

76
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,398
RID OF RETURNING PLAYERS.

77
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,441
SO HAVING ONE OF THEM GO WAS A

78
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,694
WIN-WIN FOR ME, EITHER WAY.

79
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,362
>> THANKS IF YOUR VOTE, MIKE.

80
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:34,737
THAT WAS LOVELY.

81
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,825
>> I DIDN'T VOTE FOR YOU, ABI.

82
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,534
I DIDN'T VOTE FOR YOU.

83
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,535
>> WHO VOTED FOR ME?

84
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:40,910
>>

85
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,119
>> DID.

86
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:41,536
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

87
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,246
>> YOU VOTED FOR ME?

88
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,248
>> YEAH, I WAS P.O.'D.

89
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,084
SOME PLAN CAN THE B" GOING.

90
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,836
NOBODY TELLS ME ABOUT THE PLAN

91
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,003
"B."

92
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:50,503
THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

93
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,379
>> YOU VOTED FOR ME?

94
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,839
>> I VOTE FOR YOU.

95
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,383
I DON'T LIKE BUYING PLAYED LIKE

96
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:55,592
THAT.

97
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,426
THAT PISSED ME OFF.

98
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,802
THAT WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE

99
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,429
TRIBAL I HAVE EVER BEEN A PART

100
00:02:59,512 --> 00:02:59,596
OF.

101
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,388
THAT WAS CRAZY.

102
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,973
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HELL

103
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:02,265
HAPPENED.

104
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:02,765
>> SO WHO VOTED FOR JEFF?

105
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,225
>> ALL FIVE OF TANDANG.

106
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,311
>> AND MALCOLM AS WELL?

107
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,355
>> NO.

108
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,608
MALCOLM-- THERE WERE FOUR PETE,

109
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,942
ONE ABY, FIVE JEFF.

110
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,277
>> SO I AM THE ONE WHO BLEW IT?

111
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,905
BY NOT VOTING FOR PETE?

112
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,614
>> THAT SUCKS.

113
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,406
>> THAT SUCKS.

114
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,949
>> THERE WAS NO PLAN.

115
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,533
NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS HELL WAS

116
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,409
GOING TO HAPPEN.

117
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,786
SO DID MY VOTE SCREW IT UP?

118
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,370
EVEN IF I VOTE FORWARD PETE,

119
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,581
TALL WOULD HAVE DONE WAS TIED IT

120
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:26,748
UP.

121
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,207
SO I VOTED FOR ABY.

122
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,292
AND NOW WE'LL SEE WHERE I STAND.

123
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,295

126
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,675
>> NO.

127
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,303
>> IT WAS TERRIBLE.

128
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,430
>> YOU WERE PLAYING THE GAME.

129
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,765
I WAS PLAYING THE GAME.

130
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,599
I JUST WENT FOR IT.

131
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,767

132
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,351

135
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,229
BIG MOVE.

136
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,398
I TRIED TO PLAY THE GAME LIKE A

137
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,485
REAL "SURVIVOR," AND IT'S JUST

138
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,822
NOT ME.

139
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,367
AND I LIED, AND I BETRAYED, AND

140
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,994

>> IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

149
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,842
I LOVE THIS GAME, BUT I THINK

150
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,052
IT'S TOO BIG FOR ME.

151
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,596
I DON'T THINK I'M-- IT'S BIGGER

00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,329
IT WAS A BIG, BOLD SET OF MOVES.

190
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:11,954
MAYBE UNPRECEDENTED IN THE

191
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,916
HISTORY OF THE "SURVIVOR," BUT

192
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,417
YOU REALLY WERE TRYING TO WORK

193
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,170
FOR YOUR ALLIANCE, WEREN'T YOU?

194
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:19,420
OKAY.

195
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,547
WHO THE HELL CAN ARGUE WITH

196
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:21,839
THAT?

197
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:26,010
YOU KNOW.

198
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,804
I CERTAINLY ADMIRE YOU, LIKE

199
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,347
YOU, AND MAYBE EVEN COMING TO

200
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,722
LOVE YOU.

201
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,641
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THAT'S GOD'S

202
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,391
HONEST TRUTH.

203
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,435
WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE--

204
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,106
YOUR HISTORY, AND YOUR CHILDHOOD

205
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,943
AND HOW THAT WOULD BE A VERY BIG

206
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,987
PART OF THE MAKEUP AND

207
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,613
PSYCHOLOGY OF SOMEONE WHO HAD

208
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,990
THE LIFE THAT YOU HAVE HAD,

209
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,576
BEING A PLEASER, BEING-- OF "AM

210
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,953
I OKAY?

211
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,371
DID YOU LIKE THAT?

212
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:53,746
WAS THAT GOOD?"

213
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,540
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW ONE LOOK FROM

214
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,876
THE WRONG PERSON SAYING, "YOU'RE

215
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,586
GOING TO GO OUT LOOKING LIKE

216
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:00,795
THAT?

217
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,587
YOU PUT ON A COUPLE OF POUND."

218
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,423
>> OH, MY GOSH, STOP.

219
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,133
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

220
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,010
>> A PERSON IN YOUR POSITION.

221
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,262
DEVASTATING.

222
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:13,182
AND SO HUTO BE A PLEASER.

223
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,018
I'M GONNA PAY FOR MY FAMILY'S

224
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:16,269
WHATEVER.

225
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:16,727
I'M THE BREAD WINNER.

226
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,480
I'VE GOT THESE RESPONSIBILITIES.

227
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,481
DO YOU LIKE ME?

228
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,524
AM I BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH?

229
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,526
AM I PRETTY ENOUGH?

230
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,570
AM I STAYING PRETTY?

231
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,364
AM I FUNNY ENOUGH?

232
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,365
I MEAN.

233
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,199
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

234
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,618
>> THAT'S MY BUSINESS, TOO.

235
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,663
>> I KNOW THAT PENNER IS ALWAYS

236
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,457
SCRAMBLING TO FIND A WAY TO

237
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,542
STAY, BUT HE REALLY STRUCK

238
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,086
SOMETHING VERY, VERY DEEP, THIS

239
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,628
INTERNAL CONFLICT.

240
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:47,049
I THINK PROBABLY AT SOME LEVEL,

241
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,470
IT'S SPENDING A LIFETIME

242
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,515
PERFORMING, TAP DANCING, ACTING,

243
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,434
DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES TO DO

244
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,813
THE RIGHT THING, TO BE LIKED.

245
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,690
>> AND YOU ARE MAYBE ONLY NOW

246
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:07,486
REALLY GETTING TO DEAL WITH HOW

247
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,282
THE TOLL, THE COST OF THAT

248
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:11,866
EXTRAORDINARY YOUTH THAT YOU

249
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,951
HAD.

250
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,495
IT DID COST YOU SOMETHING.

251
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,496
YOU LOST SOMETHING.

252
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,207
AND NOW YOU KNOW.

253
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,710
AND I LOVE YOU.

254
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,755
>> MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN BASED

255
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,758
ON PUBLIC PERCEPTION.

256
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,551
YOU BE, I'VE LIVED MY LIFE ON

257
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,637
THE SAME SINCE I WAS SEVEN YEARS

258
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,263
OLD.

259
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,351
AND EVEN BEFORE THEN, LEARNED TO

260
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,728
GET LOVE BY PERFORMING AND BEING

261
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,646
GOOD AND BEING LIKABLE.

262
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,899
SO THIS IS A WHOLE LIFETIME OF

263
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,107
THIS.

264
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,567
>> I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU

265
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:46,734
CRY.

266
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,903
>> NO, IT'S-- JUST TO BE

267
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,571
UNDERSTOOD.

268
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,949
AND YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND

269
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:53,449
MYSELF.

270
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,494
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

271
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,620
IF I DO THE WRONG THING, WILL I

272
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,039
STILL BE OKAY?

273
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,541
IF I AM NOT LIKED OR IF I'M

274
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,834
JUDGED, WILL THAT BE OKAY?

275
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:09,632
CAN I SURVIVE NOT BEING, YOU

ON MY GO, ONE PERSON FROM EACH

MUDDY WATER, OVER THE A-FRAME,

288
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,965

THIS REWARD IS QUITE

00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:50,175
EXTRAORDINARY.

00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,385
PEOPLE OF ALL AGES ARE JUST

511
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,303

AM I CLOSE?

518
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,409
WE PLAYED A LOCAL GAME WHICH IS

519
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,619
SIMILAR TO A PINATA KIND OF GAME

520
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,203
WE WOULD HAVE, AND I SORT OF,

521
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,458
YOU KNOW, JOKED AROUND A LITTLE

522
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,960

MICRONESIA FOR A YEAR.

535
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,269
REMEMBERING ALL THE GOOD TIMES

536
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,063
I'VE HAD WAS A GOOD REMINDER OF

537
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,107
HOW MUCH I ENJOY WORKING WITH

538
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,817
KIDS, AND HOW FULFILLING THAT

539
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,444
CAN BE

540
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,487
( LAUGHTER )

541
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,156
>> WHAT!

542
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,699
WHY DID I GIVE THIS UP?

543
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,494
THIS MEANS SO MUCH FOR TO ME

544
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,662
THAN POURING DRINKS FOR GIRLS IN

545
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:00,829
BARS.

546
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,456
IT REALLY MADE ME CONSIDER WHAT

547
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,208
I WAS DOING WITH MY LIFE FOR THE

548
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:04,917
PAST YEAR.

549
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,376
IT REALLY WAS A LIFE-SHAPING

550
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:06,794
EXPERIENCE FOR ME.

551
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,129
>> OH, MY GOD!

552
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,298
>> OH, MY GOD!

553
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,926
>> I WANT SOME SO BAD.

554
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,301
>> YES, PLEASE!

555
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,220
I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING!

556
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,723
THE FOOD WAS FABULOUS.

557
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:24,478
>> NUM-NUM-NUM.

558
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,355
>> IT'S A GREAT BREAK FROM THE

559
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,148
GAME ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE GET TO

560
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,567
TALK STRATEGY OVER A BEER OR TWO

561
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,235
BECAUSE I'M IN A VERY TOUGH

562
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:31,527
POSITION.

563
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,362
>> THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD

564
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,656
MAKE THIS BETTER IS IF WE HAD

565
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:35,864
SKUPIN.

566
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,075
>> IF WE GET SKUPIN.

567
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,993
LISA I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

568
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:40,327
CAREFUL WITH.

569
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,913
>> SKUPIN WAS TREATED HORRIBLY

570
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,789
BY THOSE GUYS.

571
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,249
>> HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE A

572
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:45,499
TRAITOR.

573
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,377
>> THAT WOULD GIVE MORE MERIT TO

574
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,295
LEAVING THAT THAN STAYING WITH

575
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:50,504
THAT.

576
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,466
OUT OF JUST SOME SENSE OF

577
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:54,842
LOYALTY.

578
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,303
>> RIGHT NOW, THE LINES HAVE

579
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,056
BEEN DRAWN AND IT'S FORMER

580
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,266
TANDANG VERSUS EVERYONE ELSE,

581
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,934
BUT LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

582
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,352
THEY MADE A MOCKERY OF SKUPIN.

583
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,896
I FEEL LIKE HE'S BEEN MISTREATED

584
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,439
AND THEY MISTREATED LISA.

585
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,190
SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET SKUPIN

586
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,484
AND LISA IN WITH US BECAUSE

587
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,277
THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY THE

588
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,320
BIGGEST ROLE IN WHICH ALLIANCE

589
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,240
MOVES ON AND WHICH STARTS

590
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:25,455
GETTING PICKED OFF.

591
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,585
>> I'M PISSED, ARTIS.

592
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,044
>> ME, TOO.

593
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,337
>> LOSING A CHALLENGE LIKE THIS

594
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:32,588
IS AWFUL.

595
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,299
IT'S REALLY DEMORALIZING.

596
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,342
YOU KIND OF NEED THAT ENERGY.

597
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,386
BUT AT LEAST I GET TIME WITH

598
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,262
LISA WHO DOESN'T REALLY KNOW

599
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,681
WHAT'S GOING ON AFTER THE TRIBAL

600
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,348
COUNCIL, WHERE SHE GOT

601
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,602
OBLITERATED, AND SKUPIN.

602
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,477
>> BUMMER!

603
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,520
>> YUP.

604
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,688
IT'S REALLY IRONIC SOMEONE I

605
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,355
WANTED TO GET RID OF FIRST OR

606
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,482
SECOND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

607
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,192
GAME NOW I'M FORCED TO WORK

608
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:54,401
WITH.

609
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,444
BUT WE NEED THE MAJORITY RIGHT

610
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,820
NOW, AND IT DOESN'T REALLY

611
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,446
MATTER WHO IT IS, BUT WHY NOT GO

612
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,489
TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE STARTED

613
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,365
THIS GAME WITH?

614
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,284
WE'RE BACK TO TANDANG STRONG.

615
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,744
THEY'RE GOING TO TRUST US A LOT

616
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,913
MORE THAN THEY'RE GOING TO TRUST

617
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:06,788
PENNER OR ANYBODY.

618
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,998
SO GETTING THEM CLOSE AND

619
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:08,624
KEEPING THEM CLOSE IS DEFINITELY

620
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,626
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO, AND

621
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,170
MAKING THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE.

622
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,465
>> YOU KNOW, IF PENNER DOESN'T

623
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,257
WIN IMMUNITY NEXT, HE NEEDS TO

624
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:17,424
GO.

625
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,134
>> NO, I KNOW.

626
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,470
>> HE NEEDS TO GO ASAP.

627
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,221
HE'S VERY DANGEROUS.

628
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,096
>> AND HE'S ANNOYING.

629
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,807
>> YEAH, AND HOPEFULLY YOU'RE

630
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,018
NOT GOING TO BE... AGAIN, LISA.

631
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:28,894
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BRING

632
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,562
INFORMATION FROM OUR SIDE TO

633
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:30,771
THEM.

634
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,481
YOU DON'T NEED TO BRING THAT UP

635
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:32,648
AGAIN.

636
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,273
I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.

637
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,275
>> I'D LIKE TO SAY, SOME MAY I

638
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,860
SAY SOMETHING--

639
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,444
>> ANYWAY, WITH ALL OF THAT

640
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,279
BEING SAID, I UNDERSTAND

641
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,989
EVERYTHING YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.

642
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,324
I THINK YOU'RE JUST GULLIBLE.

643
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,492
I THINK YOU'RE JUST NAIVE, AND

644
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,453
YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO-- TO

645
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,080
DO BOTH.

646
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,623
YOU KNOW-- YOU-- YOU JUST DIDN'T

647
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:49,998
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

648
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:56,421
>> ABY IS JUST A LOOSE CANNON.

649
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,674
SHE THINKS SHE KNOWS SO MUCH

650
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,883
ABOUT THE GAME AND SO MUCH ABOUT

651
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,425
PEOPLE IN GENERAL.

652
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,385
I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD HER THAT.

653
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,680
BUT SHE NEEDS TO SHUT UP BEFORE

654
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,139
SHE SCHIEWZ EVERYTHING ALL UP.

655
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,642
>> IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US

656
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,435
FIVE RIGHT NOW, AND HOPEFULLY

657
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,854
MIKE WILL BE ON BOARD, TOO, TO

658
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,523
MAKE SURE THAT FTHAT MAN,

659
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,650
PENNER, DOES NOT WIN IMMUNITY

660
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,693
TOMORROW, HE'S GOING HOME.

661
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,485
ALL FIVE OF US HERE NEEDS TO

662
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,737
VOTE FOR HIM BECAUSE I'M SURE

663
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,823
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME OR

664
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,448
FOR PETER AGAIN.

665
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,324
SO WE HAVE TO BE REALLY STRONG,

666
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,951
THE FIVE OF US.

667
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,036
>> ONCE PENNER GOES HOME, THIS

668
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,288
IS A CAKEWALK.

669
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,498
>> YEAH, LIKE BEING-- YOU JUST

670
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,417
NEED TO BE A FIGHTER NOW AND YOU

671
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,418
HAVE TO MAKE SURE PENNER GOES

672
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:34,626
HOME.

673
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,502
>> I'M ALL FOR THAT.

674
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:39,548
VERYINTERESTING HOW THINGS SPLIT

675
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,717
AT THE CHALLENGE TODAY.

676
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,552
MY THOUGHT WAS AT LEAST WE GOT

677
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,220
SOME TIME.

678
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,805
MAYBE WE COULD REEVALUATE AND BE

679
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,557
SOLAND I HAD BE TANDANG FIVE.

680
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,225
BUT THEN I GET BACK HERE TO THE

681
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,852
ISLAND, AND ABI WAS TERRIBLE.

682
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,688
>> YOU GOTTA KEEP SKUPIN ON A

683
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,815
LITTLE BIT OF A LEASH, TOO--

684
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,358
>> OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY.

685
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,027
>> SO MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE TO GO

686
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,319
WITH THE OTHER ALLIANCE.

687
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,571
BUT I'VE MADE THIS GRAND STAND

688
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,241
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR LOYALTY TO

689
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:07,409
TANDANG TO KEEP SKUPIN, SO TO

690
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,829
FLIP OVER TO KALABAW LOOKS ON

691
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,497
THE OUTSIDE REALLY AWFUL, BUT ON

692
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,541
THE INSIDE, IT PROBABLY MAKES

693
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,792
MORE SENSE.

694
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,711
SO I'M JUST ABSOLUTELY-- I DON'T

695
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,630
EVEN KNOW WHAT TO THINK NOW.

696
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:45,197
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

697
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,239
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

698
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:46,656
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

699
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,199
>> YUP.

700
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,075
>> YEAH.

701
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,992
>> YEAH.

702
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,952
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

703
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,161
PENNER.

704
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,496
I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK.

705
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,580
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO HELP.

706
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,667
>> OH, NO.

707
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,503
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY

708
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,130
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

709
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,174
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL

710
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,718
EACH BALANCE AN OVERSIZED PADDLE

711
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,969
ON A STAND.

712
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,638
YOU'LL ROLL A BALL DOWN THE

713
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,056
PADDLE AND ATTEMPT TO LAND IT IN

714
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,682
ONE OF SIX SPOTS.

715
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,727
FIRST PERSON TO GET A BALL ON

716
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,771
ALL SIX SPOTS WINS IMMUNITY IS

717
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,814
SAFE FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL,

718
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,482
GUARANTEED A ONE IN EIGHT SHOT

719
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,984
AT WINNING THIS GAME.

720
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,695
A LOT OF SMILES ON THAT.

721
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,533
GOOD ODDS, HUH, ART, A S?

722
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,327
>> REALLY GOOD ODDS IF YOU KNOW

723
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,036
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

724
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,081
>> Jeff: LOSERS WILL GO TO

725
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:36,665
TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY

726
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,334
WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

727
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,419
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

728
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:41,753
FOR IMMUNITY.

729
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,506
A ONE IN EIGHT SHOT AT WINNING

730
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,924
THIS GAME.

731
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,551
SURVIVORS READY?

732
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:53,223
GO.

733
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:53,765
OBVIOUSLY, THERE WILL BE A

734
00:23:53,849 --> 00:24:01,148
LEARNING CURVE TO THIS.

735
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,483
YOUR GOAL IS TO LAND SIX BALLS

736
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:08,155
ON YOUR PADDLE ALL AT ONCE.

737
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:18,707
>> SORRY.

738
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,917
>> Jeff: SKUPIN LANDS HIS

739
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:28,633
FIRST WALL.

740
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,095
PETE LANDS ONE.

741
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,309
ARTIS CLOSE.

742
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:43,315
SKUPIN LANDS A SECOND WALL.

743
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,609
LISA'S GOT NOTHING.

744
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,778
ABI HAS NOTHING.

745
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,946
PENNER'S GOT NOTHING.

746
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,072
PETE LOOKING FOR THAT SECOND

747
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:51,656
BALL AND HE'S GOT IT.

748
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,659
PETE NOW WITH TWO.

749
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,077

00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:09,007
SKUPIN WITH FOUR.

753
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,383
PETE LANDS HIS FOURTH.

754
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,928
PETE NOW WITH FOUR.

755
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,096
SKUPIN WITH FOUR.

756
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,390
A TWO-HORSE RACE RIGHT NOW.

757
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,476
IT'S GOING VERY QUICKLY THESE

758
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:19,684
GUYS.

759
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,521
SKUPIN CLOSE TO HIS FIFTH.

760
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:32,530
SKUPIN STICKS HIS FIFTH ONE.

761
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,573
PETE KNOCKS ONE OF HIS OFF.

762
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,617
NOW PETE'S GOT ANOTHER ONE

763
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:35,825
ROLLING.

764
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,537
PETE LOSING OAR ONE, DISASTER.

765
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,124
PETE LOSES TWO BALLS ON THAT

766
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,000
ONE.

767
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,293
SKUPIN LOOKING FOR HIS SIXTH AND

768
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:50,131
FINAL BALL TO WIN IMMUNITY.

769
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,132
AND HE DOES IT.

770
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,969
SKUPIN WINS IMMUNITY!

772
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,347
AT WINNING THIS GAME.

773
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,182
>> NICE JOB!

774
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,642
WHAT THE HELL!

775
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:05,105
>> Jeff: SKUPIN, COME ON OVER.

776
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,566
( APPLAUSE )

777
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,818
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING

778
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,279
TO TAKE TO WIN IMMUNITY ON THIS

779
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,280
SHOW.

780
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,906
SKUPIN SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL

781
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,156
COUNCIL.

782
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,868
>> THERE YOU GO, SCUPPER.

783
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,036
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY ELSE IS

784
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,704
FAIR GAME.

785
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,205
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

786
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,623
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK TO

787
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,082
CAMP.

788
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,667
I WILL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL

789
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:25,875
COUNCIL.

790
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,835
>> TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL,

791
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,586
NECESSARY SOMETHING GOES WRONG

792
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,547
WE CAN GET PENNER OUT AND WE CAN

793
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,923
ACTUALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A

794
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,135
LONG TIME, COME BACK TO CAMP,

795
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:39,431
TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND SAY

796
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,516
WOOSAA.

797
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,327
>> A NEW CHALLENGE WIN-TIME

798
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:00,535
RECORD.

799
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,370
>> I DIDN'T WIN THAT IMMUNITY

800
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:02,620
CHALLENGE.

801
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,747
SO I BE MY DAYS ARE NUMBERED IF

802
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,833
I CAN'T PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER.

803
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,959
THE PROBLEM IS THE NUMBERS.

804
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,003
I NEED FIVE VOTES TO EVEN HAVE

805
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,047
AN ICE CUBE'S CHANCE OF HELL OF

806
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,464
STAYING IN THE GAME.

807
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,466
>> I CAN'T BEAT YOU GUYS AT THE

808
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,008
PHYSICAL ONES.

809
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,553
I MIGHT AS WELL BEAT YOU AT THE

810
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,012
BALANCE ONES.

811
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:19,721
>> I WISH I WOULD BE VOTING OFF

812
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,057
MIKE TODAY, BUT WE NEED HIM FOR

813
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,974
THE NUMBERS.

814
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,477
>> YEAH, I WAS LOUSY AT THAT.

815
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:25,727
I GOT ONE.

816
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,771
>> PENNER IS A WIGGER THREAT,

817
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,814
THOUGH, BUT MIKE IS REALLY

818
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,065
ANNOYING.

819
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:35,278
>> IT'S SO DIFFERENT HAVING

820
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:35,570
IMMUNITY.

821
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:42,994
INDIVIDUAL, THAT IS.

822
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:43,161
OH!

823
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,037
>> SORRY.

824
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,456
SORRY, ARE YOU OKAY?

825
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,207
ARE YOU OKAY?

826
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,958
>> I MEAN, I'M NOT GOING TO DIE.

827
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,793
>> YOU KNOW, PENNER IS ACTUALLY

828
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,710
REALLY CHARMING.

829
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,506
A LITTLE TOO SMART FOR HIS OWN

830
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:54,714
GOOD.

831
00:27:54,798 --> 00:28:00,470
SO TIME FOR HIM TO GO HOME.

832
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,473
>> UNLESS ONE OF OUR TWO PEOPLE

833
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,517
THAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT TURNS

834
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,394
ON US TONIGHT.

835
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,270
>> NAH.

836
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,939
>> BUT I DON'T KNOW.

837
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,690
LEASE AND SKUPIN KIND OF WORRY

838
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:12,857
ME.

839
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:17,112
>> SHHH.

840
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,948
>> HERE'S A THOUGHT-- AND I

841
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,491
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS THINK--

842
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,328
I'M AFRAID, ONE, ABI COULD BE

843
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:31,292
SELFISH AND JUST PLAY THE IDOL

844
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:31,668
HERSELF.

845
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,919
SHE COULD END UP PASSING IT OFF

846
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:33,670
TO PETE.

847
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,213
>> HEY, GUYS!

848
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,548
I JUST FOUND A HUGE CLAM.

849
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:36,965
>> SHE FOUND A CLAM.

850
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,801
>> YA, WHOOPI.

851
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,885
YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT GOING TO GIVE

852
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,762
IT TO ARTIS.

853
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,433
ONE THOUGHT IS TO VOTE ARTIS.

854
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,809
>> ARTIS IS A SURE THING.

855
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,020
>> SHOULD I TELL PENNER ARTIS.

856
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,814
>> YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW, I'VE GOT

857
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,776
MY ALLIANCE WITH MALCOLM AND THE

858
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,945
FORMER KALABAW TRIBE, CARTER AND

859
00:28:59,028 --> 00:28:59,863
JONATHAN, AND THE GOAL FOR

860
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,614
TONIGHT IS DEFINITELY TO GET RID

861
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,616
OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL TANDANG

862
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,410
MEMBERS, BREAK THAT LITTLE

863
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,828
EMPIRE UP, AND THEN REALLY

864
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,997
CONTINUE TO JUST TURN THIS GAME.

865
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,624
BUT THE PLAN VERY MUCH HINGES ON

866
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,000
SKUPIN AND LISA.

867
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,210
IF WE CAN'T GET THE NUMBERS,

868
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,922
JONATHAN IS GOING HOME.

869
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,467
>> I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A

870
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:20,717
QUESTION.

871
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:20,967
>> OKAY.

872
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,635
>> I'M LIKE A STORYTELLER.

873
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,972
THAT'S WHAT I DO, YOU KNOW?

874
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:26,848
"SURVIVOR" IS A BIG STORY.

875
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,807
WHAT'S THE STORY THAT'S GOING TO

876
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,642
BE TOLD THIS SEASON?

877
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,603
WHO ARE THE GOOD GUYS AND WHO

878
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,604
ARE THE BAD GUYS?

879
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,605
WHO IS THE UNDERDOG?

880
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,898
WHO IS THE AUDIENCE GOING TO BE

881
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:35,982
ROOTING FOR, CONSCIOUSLY OR NOT?

882
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,109
WHAT DOES THE AUDIENCE WANT TO

883
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:38,776
HAVE HAPPEN?

884
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,986
THE AUDIENCE IS GOING TO WATCH

885
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:40,153
YOU.

886
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,988
AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY, "SHE'S

887
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:45,658
BEING LOYAL TO THE PEOPLE THAT

888
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,242
SHE'S BEEN LOYAL TO ALL ALONG,

889
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,870
AND THAT'S A WONDERFUL THING."

890
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,454
>> RIGHT.

891
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,663
>> BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE

892
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,707
HAPPY THAT YOU ARE HELPING THESE

893
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,250
THREE GUYS GO FURTHER, AND I'M

894
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,044
NOT GOING TO TRY TO INFLUENCE

895
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,087
YOU TO COME OVER TO MY SIDE, BUT

896
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:58,838
I HOPE THAT YOU AND SKUPIN DO

897
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,007
THE RIGHT THING AND TELL A

898
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,300
BETTER STORY.

899
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,594
>> I LIKE JONATHAN SO MUCH.

900
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,762
I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM HIM

901
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,888
OUT HERE.

902
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,851
BUT, MAN, MY HEAD IS SPINNING.

903
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:17,065
I STILL WANT TO BE LOYAL.

904
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,068
BUT IS THAT THE OLD LISA?

905
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,695
IS THAT THE LEASE ON WHAT SPENT

906
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,197
HER LIFE WONDERING WHETHER BWHAT

907
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,990
OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING?

908
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,784
>> LISTEN, THIS IS MY

909
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,535
PERSPECTIVE ON THE STORY.

910
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,078
AND YOU'RE IN THE THICK OF IT.

911
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,579
YOU MIGHT BE THE FULCRUM

912
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,623
CHARACTER, YOU KNOW.

913
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,210
I AM PLANTING SEEDS WITH LISA

914
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,128
BECAUSE I'M PLAYING MY ASS OFF

915
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,296
OUT HERE.

916
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,256
BUT I CANNOT PANIC.

917
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,299
I HAVE TO BE CALM, COOL,

918
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:43,591
COLLECTED.

919
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,885
AND I HOPE THAT I GOT TRUE TO

920
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:46,928
HER, WHETHER IT CHANGES HER VOTE

921
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,847
OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW.

922
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,391
BUT I ONLY NEED ONE OF THEM,

923
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,768
EITHER HER OR SKUPIN.

924
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:57,230
HOW DO YOU FEEL, HONESTLY?

925
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,898
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN VOTE

926
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:04,445
WITH US AND NOT WITH THEM?

927
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,321
WITH US?

928
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,114
WE'RE GUARANTEED THE FINAL FIVE.

929
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,449
YOU'RE THE FULCRUM VOTE.

930
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,410
I THINK THAT YOU COULD GO EITHER

931
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:10,577
WAY.

932
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,453
>> I KNOW THAT PEN SER

933
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,871
INTERESTED IN CREATING

934
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,122
SOMETHING.

935
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,582
>> LET'S LOCK IT DOWN.

936
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:15,915
IT'S ARTIS--

937
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,334
>> BUT LISA AND I AGREED ON DAY

938
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,752
ONE WE'LL ALWAYS TELL EACH OTHER

939
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,045
THE TRUTH, AND, YOU KNOW, SHE

940
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,089
ORCHESTRATED A PRETTY BIG MOVE

941
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,384
THE OTHER DAY IN AN EFFORT TO

942
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,385
SAVE THE TANDANG ALLIANCE IN

943
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:27,969
ORDER TO SAVE ME, SO I WANT TO

944
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,472
PLAY THIS GAME WITH LISA.

945
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,141
BUT I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IF I'M

946
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,935
GOING TO MAKE A BOLD MOVE THAT

947
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,895
SHE'S FIRMLY ON THE SIDE THAT

948
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,771
I'M CHOOSING.

949
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,189
>> WELL, TALK TO ME.

950
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,358
HELP ME OUT HERE AS FAR AS THE

951
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,110
BIG PICTURE HERE.

952
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:49,490
YOU UPON, THERE KNOW, THERE'S

953
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:49,741
THOUGHTS.

954
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,325
ONE, WHICH GROUP CAN YOU GET

955
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,579
FURTHER WITH?

956
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,830
TWO, WHICH GROUP WOULD YOU

957
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,123
RATHER PLAY WITH?

958
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,625
MY QUESTION IS ALWAYS THEN HOW

959
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,668
CAN WE STAY LOYAL TO SOMEBODY

960
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,919
WHO IS NOT LOYAL TO US.

961
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,503
>> RIGHT.

962
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,921
>> LIKE, WHERE IS THAT LOYALTY?

963
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,424
>> WHAT ABOUT BIGGER PICTURE,

964
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,008
YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE I'M

965
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,176
SWINGING HERE, SWING THERE,

966
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,970
LOYAL HERE, LOYAL THERE, SAYING

967
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,347
THIS AND CHANGING MY MIND.

968
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,598
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

969
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,059
>> THE BIGGER PICTURE SUAND I

970
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,101
HAVE AN ALLIANCE TO THE VERY

971
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,102
END.

972
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,146
SO, I MEAN, IS THERE EVEN THE

973
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,607
THOUGHT OF YOU GOING THE OTHER

974
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:22,774
WAY?

975
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,401
>> I'M REALLY CONSIDERING IT.

976
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,944
FROM THE BEGINNING I'VE THOUGHT

977
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,988
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS KEEP

978
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,032
TANDANG MEMBERS STRONG BECAUSE I

979
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,785
WANT TO STAY LOYAL TO TANDANG.

980
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,994
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY FROM

981
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,039
THE BEGINNING I WAS LOYAL TO

982
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:38,539
TANDANG.

983
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,833
BUT IF TANDANG IS NO LONGER

984
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,127
LOYAL TO ME, THEN AM I BEING

985
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,547
EXACTLY WHAT ABI ACCUSES ME OF

986
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,131
BEING-- JULLIBLE AND NAIVE?

987
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,008
AND I HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT

988
00:32:49,092 --> 00:33:03,064
THAT.

989
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,148
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

990
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,609
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

991
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,736
R.C.

992
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,320
AND JEFF VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

993
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:17,245
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

994
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,413
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS ONE OF

995
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,999
THE CRAZIEST I'VE EVER SEEN.

996
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,793
LISA, WAS THERE MUCH FALLOUT?

997
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,337
>> THE FALLOUT WAS SO INTERNAL

998
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,463
IN ME.

999
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,048
AND YET, WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE

1000
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,344
ISLAND, I WAS WELCOMED WITH SUCH

1001
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:33,553
GRACE.

1002
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,513
EVERYBODY SAID, "IT'S A GAME.

1003
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,348
YOU TRIED TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.

1004
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,099
YOU DIDN'T PLAY IT TOO WELL, BUT

1005
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,601
YOU WERE PLAYING IT."

1006
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,102
>> Jeff: ABI, YOU WEREN'T

1007
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:45,356
HAPPY AT ALL AT THE LAST TRIBAL

1008
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,606
COUNCIL.

1009
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,191
DID YOU SHOW GRACE TO LEASE AS

1010
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:47,400
WELL?

1011
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,068
>> DID I SHOW GRACE TO YOU AS

1012
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:49,277
WELL?

1013
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,530
>> I ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED MORE

1014
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,657
DWRAIS FROM THE PEOPLE THAT I

1015
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,826
WAS AGAINST THAN THE PEOPLE I

1016
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,994
WAS TRYING TO PROTECT THE

1017
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,830
NUMBERS FOR.

1018
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,039
>> Jeff: WHAT'S THAT

1019
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,710
INDICATIVE OF, LISA?

1020
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,003
>> MATURITY.

1021
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:07,295
EXPERIENCE.

1022
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,254
I THINK THERE ARE MORE

1023
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,297
"SURVIVOR" FANS ON THE OTHER

1024
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,717
ALLIANCE THAT COULD SEE I WAS

1025
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,886
TRYING TO FLUSH OUT AN IDOL, AND

1026
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,054
BLINDSIDE THE BIGGEST THREAT,

1027
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:17,638
PROTECT SKUPIN AND KEEP THE

1028
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,474
NUMBERS AND DO EVERYTHING, AND

1029
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,560
THEN THE PROVERBIAL POOP HIT THE

1030
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,145
FAN, AND THE FAN WAS POINTED

1031
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,314
TOWARDS ME AND LANDED ON ME.

1032
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,774
>> Jeff: ABI, I HAVE TO SAY

1033
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,317
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE IS SO

1034
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,943
TENSE IT'S LIKE VENOM IS READY

1035
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:31,402
TO COME OUT.

1036
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,487
>> I WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO

1037
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,322
WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.

1038
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,199
IT'S INTERESTING.

1039
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,993
I MEAN, THAT THE OTHER ALLIANCE

1040
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,161
IS MORE PROTECTIVE OF HER THAN

1041
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:40,369
WE ARE.

1042
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,163
I DON'T THINK SO.

1043
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,122
>> Jeff: I.

1044
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,417
>> Jeff: I DIDN'T HEAR HER SAY

1045
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:46,709
PROTECTIVE.

1046
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,920
I JUST HEARD HER SAY THEY SHOWED

1047
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:49,128
GRACE.

1048
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,379
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

1049
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,130
I FELT LIKE I HAD SHOWN GRACE TO

1050
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,884
HER AS WELL, BUT APPARENTLY NOT.

1051
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,010
>> Jeff: ARTIS, ARE YOU

1052
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,512
SURPRISED THAT THIS DEEP INTO

1053
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,056
THE GAME IT'S STILL TANDANG

1054
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,599
VERSUS KALABAW?

1055
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,351
>> NO.

1056
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,394
TANDANG HAD ONE OF THE MOST

1057
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,188
POWERFUL TRIBES PUT TOGETHER IN

1058
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:07,772
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY AND IT'S

1059
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:08,356
PLAYING OUT LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED

1060
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,233
TO PLAY OUT.

1061
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:10,650
>> Jeff: TENIECE?

1062
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,695
>> THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT.

1063
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,363
BUT BIG MOVES ARE ALWAYS MADE IN

1064
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,282
THIS GAME AND WHO KNOWS WHEN

1065
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:18,699
THINGS CAN SHIFT.

1066
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,326
SO TO THINK IT CONTINUES TO GO

1067
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,328
SMOOTHLY I THINK IT'S A REAL

1068
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,871
RISK TO TAKE IN THIS GAME TO

1069
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,247
THINK THAT WAY.

1070
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,457
>> LET'S CLEAR THE AIR.

1071
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,835
I'M NOT SAYING I'M TOTAL LEEL

1072
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,211
100% COMFORTABLE AND SAFE.

1073
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,339
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AT ANY

1074
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,633
MOMENT IN THIS GAME I COULD BE

1075
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,009
BLINDSIDED JUST LIKE ANYBODY

1076
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:37,218
ELSE.

1077
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,346
>> Jeff: SO, PENNER, WAS WITH

1078
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,640
SKUPIN HAVING THE NECKLACE

1079
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,308
TONIGHT DOES IT GO BEYOND

1080
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,726
FEELING SAFE?

1081
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,353
THAT IS CURRENCY AROUND HIS

1082
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:47,562
NECK.

1083
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:47,895
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1084
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,897
I THINK A NUMBER OF US HAVE OVER

1085
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,566
THE COURSE OF THE LAST NUMBER OF

1086
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,985
DAYS SEEN OURSELVES AS MAYBE

1087
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:54,986
FULCRUM VOTES, THAT THIS COULD

1088
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,779
BE A WAY TO TIP THE BALANCE ONE

1089
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,405
WAY OR THE OTHER, AND I GUESS

1090
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,907
TONIGHT WE'LL FIND OUT.

1091
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,449
>> Jeff: SKUPIN, NOT ONLY DO

1092
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,493
YOU HAVE IMMUNITY TONIGHT, YOU

1093
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:02,785
HAVE A VOTE.

1094
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,912
AND WITH NINE PEOPLE, WE'RE

1095
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,955
GETTING DOWN TO IT.

1096
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,206
>> I'LL TELL YOU, HAVING THIS

1097
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,917
AROUND YOUR NECK IS AN

1098
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,543
UNBELIEVABLE FEELING.

1099
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,170
I NEVER FELT IT BEFORE.

1100
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,963
IT'S BEEN 12 YEARS, AND I'VE

1101
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,381
NEVER GIVEN UP THE DREAM OF

1102
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,799
PLAYING THIS GAME AGAIN BECAUSE

1103
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,051
I CAME OUT ORIGINALLY FOR THE

1104
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:19,260
MONEY.

1105
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,971
AND THEN THE GAME GOT BIGGER

1106
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,097
THAN THE MONEY.

1107
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,057
>> Jeff: SO AS A FAN OF THE

1108
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,602
GAME, DID YOU APPRECIATE LISA'S

1109
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,644
MOVE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL?

1110
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,146
>> WELL, AND IT WAS REALLY FOR

1111
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,440
THE WHOLE TANDANG TRIBE AT THAT

1112
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:32,648
POINT.

1113
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,318
THE I LOVED IT.

1114
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:35,735
I LOVED THE MOVE.

1115
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,486
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?

1116
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,071
ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT

1117
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,364
MY LIFE IS BIGGER THAN THIS

1118
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,909
GAME, AND THIS GAME IS BIGGER

1119
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:43,117
THAN ME.

1120
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,827
>> Jeff: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1121
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,871
>> WHAT THAT MEANS IS, IS THIS

1122
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,457
JUST A GAME OR CAN I JUST CUT

1123
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,168
OFF MY HEART TO PLAY IT?

1124
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,545
AND THEN I LEARN, NO, I CAN'T.

1125
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,465
AND THIS IS SUCH A HUGE,

1126
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,258
LIFE-ALTERING EXPERIENCE FOR ME

1127
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,052
ALREADY, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I

1128
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,137
CAN LEARN IT ALL IN 39 DAYS.

1129
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,599
BUT I DO KNOW THESE 39 DAYS ARE

1130
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:10,519
GOING TO PROBABLY CHANGE MY MORE

1131
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,273
THAN MAYBE 39 OF MY 49 YEARS.

1132
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,358
>> Jeff: PENNER, YOU'VE GOT TO

1133
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,401
APPRECIATE SOMEBODY WHO PLAYS

1134
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,819
THIS GAME.

1135
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,738
>> I DO APPRECIATE IT.

1136
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,364
AND I HOPE THAT THE NUMBERS MAY

1137
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,158
HAVE SHIFTED, AND I'LL STAY IN

1138
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:24,825
THE GAME.

1139
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,368
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR.

1140
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,495
>> Jeff: DENISE, IS EVERYONE

1141
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,664
AWARE THERE'S A CHANCE THE

1142
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,248
NUMBERS COULD HAVE SHIFTED?

1143
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,457
>> YOU KNOW, I HONESTLY DON'T

1144
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,627
THINK THE TANDANG TRIBE BELIEVES

1145
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,419
THE NUMBERS WILL SHIFT, BUT

1146
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,337
DEFINITELY THAT'S THE HOPE.

1147
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,505
THE NUMBERS MAY SHIFT AND THINGS

1148
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,591
WILL BE UPSIDE DOWN TONIGHT.

1149
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,843
>> Jeff: ABI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

1150
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,469
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO

1151
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:43,844
HAPPEN TONIGHT?

1152
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,597
>> I HOPE TANDANG HAS THE

1153
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,099
NUMBERS, AND I DON'T AGREE WITH

1154
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:48,265
YOU.

1155
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,268
I THINK THAT TANDANG HAS REALLY

1156
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:51,852
CONSIDERED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE

1157
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,688
THE NUMBERS.

1158
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:53,896
WILL BE.

1159
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,480
>> Jeff: AND WHAT WOULD THAT

1160
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:54,689
MEAN?

1161
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,482
WHO WOULD YOU NOT HAVE?

1162
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,068
>> I AM NOT VERY SURE ABOUT LISA

1163
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,822
AT THIS POINT.

1164
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:07,618
>> INCREDIBLE.

1165
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:07,952
>> Jeff: WOW.

1166
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,621
>> JEFF, THIS IS WHAT I HAVE

1167
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,289
GOTTEN ALL ALONG.

1168
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,084
AND I'VE TRIED TO SAY THAT

1169
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,210
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORD,

1170
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:17,628
AND MY ACTION HAVE ONLY BEEN

1171
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,421
LOYAL TO TANDANG.

1172
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,965
BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I NEED TO

1173
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,634
HEAR THESE WORDS AND THESE

1174
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,053
ACTIONS AND... THINK ABOUT A

1175
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,764
DECISION.

1176
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,390
>> Jeff: WELL, ONCE AGAIN, WE

1177
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,643
GO INTO A VOTE WITH A LOT OF

1178
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:32,935
UNCERTAINTY.

1179
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:33,477
LET'S TRY TO CLEAR IT UP.

1180
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,521
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1181
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,772
CANNOT VOTE FOR SKUPIN.

1182
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,691
ANYBODY ELSE, FAIR GAME.

1183
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:49,160
ARTIS, YOU'RE UP.

1184
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,457
>> I'M NOT SENDING YOU HOME

1185
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,876
BECAUSE YOU'RE A RETURNING

1186
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,084
PLAYER.

1187
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,294
I'M SENDING YOU HOME BECAUSE

1188
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,670
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THIS GAME

1189
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:12,308
AND I RESPECT THAT.

1190
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,519
>> I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT ABI IS

1191
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,689
NEVER GOING TO GIVE YOU HER

1192
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,690
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1193
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,334
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1194
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,086
VOTES.

1195
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,055
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1196
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:51,680
IDOL AND WANT TO PLAY TNOW WOULD

1197
00:39:51,764 --> 00:40:00,981
BE THE TIME TO DO SO

1198
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,149
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTE ARE READ,

1199
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,150
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1200
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,402
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1201
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:08,239
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1202
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:08,531
IMMEDIATELY.

1203
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:08,989
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1204
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:13,577
FIRST VOTE, ARTIS.

1205
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,539
PENNER.

1206
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,665
ARTIS.

1207
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:22,586
TWO VOTES ARTIS.

1208
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:22,837
PENNER.

1209
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,004
WE'RE TIED.

1210
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,923
TWO VOTES ARTIS, TWO VOTES

1211
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,967
PENNER.

1212
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,175
PENNER.

1213
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,053
THAT'S THREE VOTES PENNER.

1214
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:31,679
PENNER.

1215
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:37,685
THAT'S FOUR VOTES PENNER.

1216
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:37,893
ARTIS.

1217
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,647
THAT'S THREE VOTES ARTIS.

1218
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,773
ARTIS.

1219
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,732
WE'RE TIED.

1220
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,360
FOUR VOTES PENNER, FOUR VOTES

1221
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:46,527
ARTIS.

1222
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,905
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1223
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,448
TENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

1224
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,161
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY, ARTIS.

1225
00:40:55,244 --> 00:41:06,672
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1226
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,929
ARTIS, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1227
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:20,144
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1228
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,153
ONCE AGAIN, THIS GAME JUST

1229
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:29,403
TURNED.

1230
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:30,905
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

1231
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:31,071
CAMP.

1232
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:31,489
GOOD NIGHT.

1233
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,548
>> Jeff:Next time on

1234
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,468
"Survivor":

1235
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,429
SKUPIN HAS A PLAN TO STEAL LISA

1236
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:55,846
FROM HER ALLIANCE.

1237
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,598
>> YOU AND ME IN THE FINAL FOUR.

1238
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,766
>> WOW!

1239
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,477
>> Jeff: BREAKING UP WITH

1240
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:01,936
ABI IS HARD TO DO.

1241
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,021
>> I CAN'T BE IN AN ALLIANCE

1242
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,147
WITH SOMETHING WHO DOESN'T TRUST

1243
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:05,314
ME.

1244
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:05,940
>> BUT YOU STARTED THE GAME WITH

1245
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:06,106
US.

1246
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,274
>> I DID.

1247
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,235
I HAVE NEVER BEEN GOOD AT

1248
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,363
BREAKUPS.

1249
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,615
>> WELL PLAYED FOR PENNER.

1250
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,660
HE MANAGED TO PULL OFF THE

1251
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:17,952
IMPROBABLE.

1252
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:18,285
WELL-PLAYED.

1253
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,995
ALL I CAN DO IS APPLAUD HIM.

1254
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,331
I HAVE NO ILL WILL TOWARD

1255
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:22,957
ANYBODY IN THE GAME BECAUSE WHEN

1256
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,418
IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE, IT IS A

1257
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:26,835
GAME.

1258
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,711
I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE

1259
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,754
HAPPY.

1260
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,547
I TAKE THAT BACK.

1261
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,130
YES I COULD HAVE, IF I HAD WON

1262
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:30,881
THE MILLION DOLLARS.
