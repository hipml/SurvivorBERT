00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,850
CRAZY.

192
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,559
Jeff: YOU'RE BECOMING A

193
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,269
LEGITIMATE FORCE.

194
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,063
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LEGITIMATE

195
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:19,605
FORCE.

196
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,064
Jeff: ALWAYS BEEN A

197
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,523
LEGITIMATE FORCE.

198
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,649
MY WHOLE LIFE.

199
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,567
Jeff: WITH EACH WIN, YOU'RE

200
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,862
GETTING CLOSER TO GETTING BACK

201
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,737
INTO THIS GAME.

202
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,574
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

203
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,658
HEAD BACK TO REDEMPTION.

204
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,202
WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT DUEL.

205
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,705
CHRISTINE HAS BEEN ON A HOT

206
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,414
STREAK.

207
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,374
SHE HAS WON FIVE DUELS IN A ROW.

208
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,584
WHEN WE MERGE, SHE COULD GO TO

209
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,669
THE OTHER SIDE OR SHE COULD COME

210
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,378
WITH US.

211
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,005
PEOPLE ARE THINKING THE MERGE IS

212
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,423
COMING AFTER THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

213
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,508
SO IF WE LOSE THE NEXT CHALLENGE

214
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,593
TMIGHT BE WORTHWHILE FOR US TO

215
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,679
SEND SOMEBODY TO REDEMPTION THAT

216
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,014
CAN BEAT CHRISTINE, COME BACK IN

217
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,640
THE GAME, AND EVEN OUT THE

218
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,349
NUMBERS.

219
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,058
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE BIG

220
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,894
MOVES IN THIS GAME, AND IF WE

221
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,604
HAVE TO, THAT MIKE A BIG MOVE

222
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,356
WORTH MAKING.

223
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,878
YOU KNOW,US OF US BEING IN

224
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,881
THIS POSITION WE'RE IN, WE'RE ON

225
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,593
DIFFERENT, OPPOSITE POLES BUT

226
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,428
STILL THE SAME SIDE OF THE LOOP.

227
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,554
WE SHOULD HELP EACH OTHER AS

228
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,180
MUCH AS WE CAN.

229
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,640
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO

230
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,265
SAY.

231
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,892
THE ONLY THING I'M WORRIED

232
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,644
ABOUT, CHRISTINE WON TODAY.

233
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,771
IF-- IF WE DON'T WIN WE'RE GOING

234
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,275
TO HAVE TO SEND SOMEBODY INTO

235
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:46,984
REDEMPTION.

236
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,110
COCHRAN AND I GOT BACK FROM THE

237
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,612
DUEL, AND I WANTED TO LET

238
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,990
COCHRAN IN ON MY WORST-CASE

239
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:53,574
SCENARIO PLAN.

240
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,617
WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEND?

241
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,245
WELL, THE THING IS, IS WE

242
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,955
HAVE TO SEND SOMEBODY WHO WE

243
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,623
KNOW CAN BEAT HER.

244
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,666
THAT WAY WE CAN GET OUR NUMBERS

245
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:01,958
BACK.

246
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,960
YEAH.

247
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,419
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO

248
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,587
REDEMPTION, BUT IF IT COMES DOWN

249
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,674
TO IT, IF IT'S LIKE A DO-OR-DIE

250
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,049
SITUATION.

251
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:10,591
I WILL GO.

252
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,260
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

253
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:12,969
WHAT I'LL HAVE TO DO IS I'LL

254
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,137
HAVE TO TAKE THE IDOL, I'LL HAVE

255
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,931
TO GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY.

256
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:17,640
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL PROMISE TO

257
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,309
GIVE IT BACK IF I MAKE IT BACK.

258
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,061
SO THEN I WOULD GO TO REF

259
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,354
DEMPTION, HOPEFULLY WIN--

260
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,981
THE GENERAL SENSE AROUND CAMP

261
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,316
IS THAT THE MERGE IS HAPPENING

262
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,442
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

263
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,860
AND NOW OZZY SUGGESTED HE'D BE

264
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,488
WILLING TO MAKE A PRETTY BOLD

265
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,323
MOVE IN THE EVENT WE LOSE OUR

266
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:34,991
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

267
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,828
HE'S CONSIDERING LENDING HIS

268
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,788
HIDDEN IMMINT IDOL TO SOMEBODY

269
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,290
ELSE ON THE TRIBE, ALLOW HIMSELF

270
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,125
TO GET VOTED OFF THE TRIBE SO HE

271
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,710
CAN BE SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

272
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,462
ARENA AND DUEL AGAINST KRISTINA,

273
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,046
HOPEFULLY WIN, COME BACK IT OUR

274
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,507
TRIBE AND KEEP OUR NUMBER

275
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,343
INTACT, 6-6 TIE GOING INTO THE

276
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,011
MERGE.

277
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,970
I WAS THINKING IT OVER IN MY

278
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,388
HEAD, AND IT MIGHT BE-- IT MIGHT

279
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:57,930
BE ONE OF THOSE BIG MOVES THEY

280
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,224
MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE.

281
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:00,933
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN

282
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,185
HAPPEN, BUT THIS IS, LIKE, MY

283
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,187
WORST-- THIS IS, LIKE,

284
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,814
WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

285
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,899
IT'S AN ADMIRABLE THING, MAN.

286
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,525
SERIOUSLY.

287
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:13,362
IT'S-- SOMETIMES YOU JUST

288
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,282
GOTTA LIKE SUCK UP AND GO FOR

289
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:16,949
IT.

290
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,576
NOW OSSIE SEEMS TO HAVE GONE

291
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,704
FROM A BITTER FREE AGENT, TEMPER

292
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,872
TANTRUM THROWING BABY TO A NEW

293
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,581
MAN.

294
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,333
IF OZZY WAS BEING HONEST, WOULD

295
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,000
WILLINGNESS FALL ON HIS SWORD

296
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,544
FOR HIS TRIBE, THAT WOULD BE

297
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,211
GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE THAT WOULD

298
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,506
MEAN I WOULDN'T BE GOING HOME AT

299
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:42,558
THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

300
00:10:42,641 --> 00:11:00,743
THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

301
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,620
THIS TRIBE IS DOWN IN THE

302
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,287
DUMPS.

303
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:03,913
WE FEEL AFTER THE VOTE LAST

304
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,747
NIGHT THAT WE'RE DIVIDED.

305
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,582
WE FEEL LIKE WE BLEW THE LAST

306
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:06,999
CHALLENGE, AND WE FEEL LIKE

307
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:07,750
WE'VE LOST.

308
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,585
WE NEED A SHOT IN THE ARM RIGHT

309
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,086
NOW, AND WE NEED SOMETHING TO

310
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,629
BOOST OUR SPIRITS.

311
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,130
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS TO

312
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,423
SAY, LOOK, GUYS.

313
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,550
WE'VE GOT THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

314
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:16,842
IDOL.

315
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,468
GO TEAM.

316
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:22,098
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

317
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:22,890
THERE'S WAVES WITHIN WAVES IN

318
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,768
THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR" TO

319
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:40,116
SURVIVE.

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,284
LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL.

321
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,160
WE'RE UNIFIED.

322
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,453
WE ARE EVEN NUMBERS.

323
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,663
WE'RE GOING INTO A CHALLENGE.

324
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,664
WE'RE PLAYING THE GREATEST GAME

325
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,456
IN THE WORLD.

326
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,499
IT'S A GREAT ADVENTURE.

327
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,834
IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER,

328
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,419
AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT,

329
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,128
PERIOD.

330
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,631
LOOK, WE'VE GOT A CLUE TO THE

331
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,133
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AND IT

332
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:57,967
SAYS IT'S BEHIND A WALL OF

333
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,468
ROOTS, OKAY.

334
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,136
WE KNOW--

335
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,430
SO RIGHT NOW, SOPHIE, ALBERT,

336
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,098
AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE THE IDOL.

337
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,808
IT'S CLOSE TO THE BEACH, BUT

338
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,809
IT'S IN THE JUNGLE.

339
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,353
BUT PEOPLE LIKE RICK AND

340
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,855

00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,836

IN JESUS' NAME.

353
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,797
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE PRAYER

354
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,299
THING, FOR ME, IT DOESN'T WEIGH

355
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,467
AS HEAVILY ON MY MIND BECAUSE

356
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,135
I'M NOT THE ONE SPEAKING THE

357
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:41,844
PRAYER.

358
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,679
I FIND COACH TO BE LITTLE MORE

359
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,680
QUESTIONABLE WHEN HE ACTUALLY IS

360
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,348
THE ONE SAYING, YOU KNOW, "DEAR

361
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,142
GOD, HELP US FIND THE IDOL,"

362
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:48,976
WHEN HE KNOWS HE HAS THE IDOL IN

363
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,019
HIS POCKET.

364
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,812
IT GIVEES ME A LITTLE BIT OF AN

365
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,938
ICKY FEELING.

366
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,856

TICKETS.

755
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,489
HAVE A GOOD TIME AT THE MOVIES.

756
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,326
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, CONGRATS.

757
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:13,743
SEE YOU, GUYS.

758
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,746
GOD BLESS ME.

759
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,583
Jeff: OSSIE, THIS THE MOST

760
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,750
INTENSITY I'VE SEEN YET IN A

761
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,212
SEASON THAT HAS BEEN VERY

762
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,255
INTENSE AND VERY CLOSE.

763
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,548
WHAT IS THE FEELING RIGHT NOW

764
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,215
FOR YOU?

765
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,383
PURE FRUSTRATION AND ANGER.

766
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,886
I FEEL LIKE WE ALMOST HAD IT.

767
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,053
WE WERE THERE.

768
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:32,721
SOMEONE DIDN'T CONNECT THE RIGHT

769
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,597
ROPE TO THE RIGHT PERSON OR

770
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,306
WHATEVER.

771
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,057
& WE WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE

772
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,642
AND GOT TANGLED UP.

773
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,519
I CAN'T EVEN BIG GWIN TO

774
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,562
DESCRIBE THE FRUSTRATION BECAUSE

775
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,563
WHEN YOU ARE JUST ABOUT TO GRAB

776
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,399
SOMETHING AND IT GETS PULLED OUT

777
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,609
OF YOUR HANDS IT'S THE WORST

778
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,568
FEELING AND YOU IMAGINE AND NOW

779
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,279
WE HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL --

780
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:49,696
ALL RIGHT, SAVAII, TRIBAL

781
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,405
COUNCIL.

782
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:50,947
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF

783
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,449
THIS TRIBE AND SENT TO

784
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,408
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

785
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,076
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK TO

786
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,827
CAMP.

787
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,621
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL TOMORROW

788
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,246
NIGHT.

789
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,414
BEFORE THE CHALLENGE, OZZY

790
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,124
REASSURED ME IN THE EVENT WE

791
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,084
LOST, OZZY WOULD SAY SEND ME,

792
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:03,919
OZZY, TO REDEMPTION ISLAND, AND

793
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,379
COME BACK AND RESTORE OUR

794
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,088
NUMBERS.

795
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:07,923
BUT AFTER I BLEW THE CHALLENGE,

796
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:08,757
IT SEEMED LIKE THAT PLAN WENT

797
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,674
OUT THE WINDOW.

798
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,718
I KNEW IMMEDIATELY THAT WAS THE

799
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,427
NEXT TARGET.

800
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,429
I REALLY DID FEEL LIKE CRYING

801
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,223
BUT I STAYED AS STRONG AS I

802
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,308
COULD AND PUT UP WITH IT.

803
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:34,115
WHAT AN ADVENTURE, GUYS.

804
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:34,741
AWESOME!

805
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,951
"JACK AND JILL, BABY!

806
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,785
AWESOME JOB.

807
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,160
YEAH!

808
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:43,416
LET'S DO IT!

809
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,753
THIS REWARD AND IMMUNITY IS

810
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,464
SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR TEAM AND WE

811
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,341
FEEL GREAT HAVING THIS PRIVATE

812
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,509
SCREENING OF THE NEW MOVIE WITH

813
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,469
HOT DOGS AND PRETTY MUCH

814
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,387
UNLIMITED CANDY.

815
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,138
HOW WE DOING?

816
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,640
WHERE WERE YOU!

817
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,642
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR

818
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,351
YOU.

819
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,644
THIS PLACE IS CREEPING ME OUT.

820
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,938
SOME TWINS HAVE STRANGE

821
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:05,480
POWERS AND THEY CAN FEEL WHEN

822
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,275
THE OTHER ONE IS HURT.

823
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,401
LITTLE HARDER.

824
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:09,818
WHAT!

825
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:19,035
OH!

826
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,912
"JACK AND JILL" LOVED IT.

827
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,498
I LOVE ADAM SANDLER.

828
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,666
PERSONALLY, I'M A FAN.

829
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,709
THE HOUSE LOOKS AMAZING!

830
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,837
YOU GOT A NEW CHANDELIER?

831
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,171
IT WAS GOOD BECAUSE IT WAS

832
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:30,964
FUNNY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE

833
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:31,965
WAS A MESSAGE AND THE MESSAGE

834
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:32,882
WAS, HEY, FAMILY COMES FIRST.

835
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,385
IT'S A GREAT MESSAGE FOR US TO

836
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,220
BE REMINDED THAT GOING INTO

837
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,055
THESE DAYS TO COME, IT WILL GET

838
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:39,723
TOUGH.

839
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,683
IT WILL GET TO BE A POINT OF

840
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,183
COMPROMISE.

841
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,854
BUT WE HAVE TO BE

842
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,688
UNCOMPROMISABLE AS A UNIT.

843
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,897
UNBREAKABLE, THAT'S WHAT OUR

844
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,233
TRIBE IS, AND NOW WE'RE READY TO

845
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,986
PLAY THE SECOND HAMP OF THIS

846
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:53,528
GAME.

847
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,195
( APPLAUSE ).

848
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:04,205
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY, AGAIN.

849
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:13,923
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY, AGAIN.

850
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,092
I MEAN, IT WAS A DISASTER.

851
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:16,926
IT WAS A DISASTER.

852
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,429
YOU KNOW THE THING SWE COULD

853
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,972
HAVE WON THAT SO EASILY BECAUSE

854
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,932
WE WERE RIGHT THERE.

855
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,560
IF YOU ALL WANT TO VENT AT

856
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,354
ME, I'M WILLING TO HEAR

857
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,063
EVERYTHING.

858
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:28,396
I CRIED LIKE A BABY THE WHOLE

859
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,023
WAY BACK.

860
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,232
I FEEL--

861
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:31,858
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

862
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,070
IT WAS THAT-- WHAT WAS SO

863
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:35,570
DIFFICULT?

864
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,237
I REALLY DON'T.

865
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,448
SO WE GET BACK TO CAMP AFTER

866
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,741
THIS DEVASTATING LOSS, WHICH I

867
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,242
GUESS, APPARENTLY, I CAUSED.

868
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,078
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE

869
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,913
AN OUTCAST ON MY TRIBE, BUT THIS

870
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,874
WAS A REAL-- A HUGE-- THIS WAS--

871
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,252
THIS WAS A NEW LEVEL OF

872
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,295
OFTRASCIZZIM, AND IT FELT

873
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:52,921
HORRIBLE.

874
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,090
THAT LOSS JUST KILLED ME.

875
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,257
LIKE I'M SAYING, IF YOU WANT

876
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,802
TO VENT AT ME, I'M TAKING IT

877
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,427
ALL.

878
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,054
IT'S ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO

879
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:01,763
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

880
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,264
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD

881
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,974
DECIDE AS A GROUP, BECAUSE--

882
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,478
WE HAVE TO DECIDE AS A GROUP

883
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,480
AND THEY HAVE TO AGREE WITH IT.

884
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,606
THIS IS IT.

885
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,982
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL RIGHT NOW.

886
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,442
THAT MOMENT, THE HIGH I HAD

887
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,110
BEEN EXPERIENCING FROM THE

888
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:15,860
KNOWLEDGE THAT, REALLY, I WASN'T

889
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,279
GOING ONLY IN ANY EVENT.

890
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,572
I WAS SAFE, NOBODY WAS GOING TO

891
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,490
KICK ME OFF.

892
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,033
THAT INVOLVEMENTED INSTANTLY,

893
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,827
AND I KNEW IMMEDIATELY THAT I

894
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,911
WAS THE NEXT TARING.

895
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,954
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY

896
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:26,955
TCOCHRAN, BUT YOU LOST IT FOR

897
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:27,664
US.

898
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,749
AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY YOU

899
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,543
LOST IT FOR US, BUT IT WAS-- IT

900
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,795
WAS A HUGE-- IT WAS A HUGE

901
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,462
ERROR.

902
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,673
AND IT ENDED UP COSTING US THE

903
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,340
WIN.

904
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,591
I'M WILLING TO DO WHATEVER.

905
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,303
I FEEL HORRIBLE.

906
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,012
AND, YOU KNOW, I SHOULD BE HELD

907
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:43,638
ACCOUNTABLE.

908
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,765
IT'S A RISKY MOVE TO SEND

909
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,975
COCHRAN TO REDEMPTION.

910
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,936
IT'S A RISKIER MOVE TO SEND ME

911
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,855
TO REDEMPTION AND HAVE THE MERGE

912
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,773
BE DELAYED ONE MORE CHALLENGE.

913
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,151
COCHRAN VOLUNTEERED TO GO TO

914
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:56,860
REDEMPTION.

915
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,986
IT'S GOING TO BE HIS CHANCE TO

916
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,114
REDEEM HIMSELF.

917
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,115
COCHRAN, WE ALL BELIEVE YOU CAN

918
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:02,615
DO IT.

919
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,283
WE DO.

920
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,284
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE YOU CAN

921
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:04,742
DO IT.

922
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,326
THAT'S THE KEY.

923
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:05,827
BUT YOU GOTTA BELIEVE IN

924
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,494
YOURSELF, MAN.

925
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,831
YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE THE

926
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,499
WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

927
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,834
IT'S NOT WORDS OF

928
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,920
ENCOURAGEMENT UPON IT IS THE

929
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,672
IDEA OF REF DEMPTION.

930
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:18,339
IT REALLY IS.

931
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,549
IT'S TIME TO REDEEM.

932
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:23,303
INSTEAD OF SENDING OZZY, THE

933
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,054
TROJAN COURSE TO REDEMPTION

934
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,848
ISLAND AND DESTROY CHRISTINE,

935
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,891
THEY'RE SENDING THE COURT

936
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:28,516
JESTER.

937
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,642
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M

938
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,561
SUPPOSED TO BE BESIDES A FUNNY

939
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,813
LITTLE DANCE AND MAKE MY HANDS

940
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,356
AROUND IN A COMICAL MANNER.

941
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,483
IT'S NOT GOING TO WIN THE

942
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,901
CHALLENGE AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT

943
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,194
GOING TO GET THAT MANY LAUGHS SO

944
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,862
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE HOPING

945
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,404
FOR.

946
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,071
FEEL IT IN YOUR HEART.

947
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,990
YOU CAN WIN.

948
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,241
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN

949
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:45,825
ANTICIPATE.

950
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,368
I MEAN, REALLY, DON'T BE

951
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,036
AFRAID.

952
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,870
YOU'VE GOT TO PUSH FEAR OUT.

953
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,913
EVERYBODY WAS ON ABOARD WITH

954
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,373
VOTING ME OFF, AND WHAT MADE IT

955
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,417
WORSE WAS THEY HAD THIS KIND OF

956
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,919
WEIRD KUMBAYA RATIONALE FOR

957
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,545
VOTING ME OFF THAT ONLY

958
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,922
CONFIRMED THEIR BELIEF THEY

959
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,590
SHOULD GO, SO I'M TERRIFIED.

960
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,925
I DON'T NEED TO BE A HERO AT

961
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:02,634
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

962
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,176
I DON'T NEED TO BE THE PERSON

963
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,052
THAT SAVES MY TRIBE.

964
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,513
I'M NOT HERE TO BE A HERO.

965
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:10,391
I'M HERE TO MAKE A AS FAR AS I

966
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,227
CAN, WHETHER THAT MEANS

967
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,686
SLITHERING ON THE GROUND.

968
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,063
I DON'T WANT TO SHINE RIGHT NOW.

969
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,065
I'M WILLING TO SHINE LATER.

970
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,233
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO TO

971
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:18,942
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

972
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,318
YOU'RE GOING TO GO THERE, AND

973
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,362
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL CHRISTINE--

974
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,406
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IS SO PAL

975
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:25,949
PANEL, THAT CHRISTINE WILL SAY

976
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,450
THAT'S IT.

977
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,117
I'M DONE.

978
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,994
I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN PULL

979
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,247
OFF THE WHOLE, "I'M

980
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:32,914
INDESTRUCTIBLE TO YOU OF SOW YOU

981
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,084
BETTER BE SHAKING YOUR BOOTS YOU

982
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,211
STUPID BITCH."

983
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,276
HOW YOU DOING, OZZY?

984
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,653
MY HEAD HURTS.

985
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,738
I COULD NOT SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

986
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,739
I BLEW IT.

987
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,282
I'M SORRY.

988
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,158
I WON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

989
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,410
YOU DON'T NEED TO APOLOGIZE

990
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:10,952
TO ME.

991
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:11,619
I'M JUST EMBARRASSED.

992
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,913
THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING I'M

993
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,539
FEELING, REALLY.

994
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,707
THAT'S WHY I FEEL LIKE THE

995
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,332
NOTION OF REDEMPTION ISLAND

996
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,628
TAKES ON, LIKE, A LITERAL.

997
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,170
RIGHT?

998
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,130
IT'S TO REDEEM YOURSELF.

999
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:29,137
YEAH.

1000
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,848
YESTERDAY, BEFORE COCHRAN

1001
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,474
COST US THE CHALLENGE, I TOLD

1002
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,685
HIM THAT I'D BE WILLING TO GO,

1003
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,312
SACRIFICE MYSELF, GO TO

1004
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,146
REDEMPTION, BEAT CHRISTINE AND

1005
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,856
GET BACK IN THIS GAME AND GIVE

1006
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,607
OUR TRIBE AN EDGE.

1007
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,984
AND LAST NIGHT I HAD SOME CRAZY

1008
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,319
DREAMS ABOUT ACTUALLY DOING WHAT

1009
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,696
I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO.

1010
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,698
I HAD TO BRING THE IDOL OUT OF

1011
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,199
MY HIDING SPOT, JUST SO

1012
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,160
EVERYBODY REALLY KNOWS THEY

1013
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,788
ACTUALLY DO HAVE IT.

1014
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,207
I MIGHT AS WELL MAKE A GRAND

1015
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:58,916
ENTRANCE.

1016
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,626
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THIS IS

1017
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,836
COCHRAN'S OPPORTUNITY, THAT HE

1018
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,005
SHOULD GOING TO REDEMPTION AND

1019
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,340
REDEEM HIMSELF BUT I CAME TO

1020
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,049
REDEEM MYSELF, SO IT'S MY

1021
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,759
OPPORTUNITY, REALLY.

1022
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,177
THE QUESTION IS WILL THE TRIBE

1023
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,642
GO ALONG WITH MY IDEA?

1024
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,769
WOW.

1025
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,020
YOU'RE AMAZING.

1026
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,856
THAT'S IT.

1027
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,815
YOU WANT TO TOUCH IT?

1028
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,318
YEAH, GIVE IT TO ME, MAN.

1029
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:29,030
SERIOUSLY, I'LL TAKE IT.

1030
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:29,614
REALLY?

1031
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,657
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

1032
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,240
I REALLY-- I'M KIND OF

1033
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,327
THINKING I SHOULD GO TO

1034
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:34,994
REDEMPTION.

1035
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,205
WHAT DO YOU THINK, COCHRAN?

1036
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:42,001
IT'SA-- YOU KNOW, I AGREE THE

1037
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,212
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SAY IT

1038
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:44,921
SHOULD BE ME.

1039
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,255
I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CONFIDENCE

1040
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,757
THEY WILL DO WELL.

1041
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,300
OZZY COMES WALTZING INTO THE

1042
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,094
CAMP WITH THIS PEARLY NECKLACE

1043
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,347
AROUND HIS NECK SAYING VOTE ME

1044
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,056
OUT.

1045
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:55,890
SEND ME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1046
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:56,599
IT WAS LIKE THE GOSPEL.

1047
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,393
I COULD HAVE DIED RIGHT THERE.

1048
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,228
WHAT MAXES YOU THINK THIS?

1049
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,939
I JUST THINK THAT I'VE GOT

1050
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,440
BETTER ODDS.

1051
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,900
I DON'T THINK SO, MAN.

1052
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,276
I DON'T KNOW.

1053
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,277
THE REACTION TO OZZY

1054
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,278
ANNOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE

1055
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,614
WILLING TO GO TO REDEMPTION

1056
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,117
ISLAND WAS MET WITH SOME

1057
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,076
OPPOSITION, SO I DON'T KNOW

1058
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,786
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

1059
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,079
AND IT'S CREEPING ME OUT.

1060
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,915
MY PIECE WITH IT IS I THINK

1061
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:23,459
EVERYONE SHOULD STAND UP FOR

1062
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,377
THEIR OWN ACTIONS AND THAT'S

1063
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,087
WHAT I DO IN LIFE AND THAT'S THE

1064
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,922
REASON I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH IT.

1065
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,633
OZZY IS TALKING ABOUT GOING

1066
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,217
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1067
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,927
EYE WON'T AGREE WITH IT.

1068
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,594
WHAT WORRIES ME MOST ABOUT THE

1069
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,096
PLAN IS THAT THE MERGE IS NOT

1070
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,973
GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE WE THINK IT

1071
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:37,640
IS.

1072
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,307
WE ARE ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR

1073
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,601
WEAKEST LINK, AND THAT'S

1074
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,310
COCHRAN.

1075
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,603
SO COCHRAN'S LEFT TO BASICALLY

1076
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,105
PULL THE REST OF THE WEIGHT THAT

1077
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,231
OZZY LEFT BEHIND, AND I DON'T

1078
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,484
REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH HOPE WE

1079
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,111
HAVE FOR ANOTHER TEAM CHALLENGE.

1080
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,487
AND I KNOW KEITH DOESN'T LIKE

1081
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,280
THIS IDEA.

1082
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,115
I UNDERSTAND WHAT KEITH'S

1083
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:54,699
SAYING.

1084
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,117
AND I FEEL THAT WAY VERY

1085
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,784
STRONGLY AS WELL.

1086
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,245
IF WE'RE WRONG ABOUT THEIR

1087
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,413
BEING A MERGE AFTER THE NEXT

1088
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,497
REDEMPTION ISLAND, THE BIGGEST

1089
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,124
DEAL WOULD BE IF WE HAVE ANOTHER

1090
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,459
CHALLENGE AND WE'RE DOWN OZZY

1091
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,919
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, DAWN'S OUR

1092
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,838
THIRD GUY, COCHRAN WOULD BE OUR

1093
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,007
FOURTH GUY.

1094
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,134
SCARY POSITION TO BE IN.

1095
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,321
Jeff: SO, OZZY, AT THE END

1096
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,655
OF THE HALF THE CHALLENGE, THERE

1097
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,783
WAS A LOT OF EMOTION.

1098
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,076
WAS THERE ANY FINGER POINTING

1099
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,660
WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO CAMP?

1100
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,286
( LAUGHS ).

1101
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,704
YEAH, THERE WAS A LOT OF

1102
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,413
EMOTION, AND A LOT OF FINGER

1103
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,041
POINTING, MOST OF THE FINGERS

1104
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,335
WENT TO COCHRAN.

1105
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,961
Jeff: COCHRAN, WHAT

1106
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:49,587
HAPPENED?

1107
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,505
I MEAN, I RECOGNIZED THERE

1108
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,255
WAS A PROBLEM WHEN DAWN AND

1109
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,174
KEITH RETURNED AND THE ROPE WAS

1110
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,968
ALL TANGLED UP AND THAT'S WHEN I

1111
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,178
STARTED TO PANIC BECAUSE I

1112
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,679
WASN'T SURE HOW TO DEAL WITH IT

1113
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,056
IN A FAST WAY.

1114
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,060
I REMEMBER LOOKING UP AT JIM,

1115
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,187
AND JUST BEING BLANK.

1116
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,564
, THINKING, GOD, THIS IS MY

1117
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,106
WORST NIGHTMARE.

1118
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,191
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

1119
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,360
Jeff: SO, JIM, YOU SAW

1120
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,528
COCHRAN PANICKING.

1121
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,030
COCHRAN HAD GOTTEN TO A POINT

1122
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,781
OF FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THE TWO

1123
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,033
WERE TANGLED UP AND HE HAD KIND

1124
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,743
OF THROWN HIS HANDS UP IN-- THIS

1125
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,328
WAS THE LOOK THAT I HAD GOTTEN.

1126
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,371
Jeff: COCHRAN, HAVE YOU

1127
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,414
FOUND YOURSELF IN SITUATIONS

1128
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,874
LIKE THIS WHERE YOU'RE MAYBE OUT

1129
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,543
OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE AND THE

1130
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,711
PANIC SETS IN?

1131
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,421
I'M USUALLY PRETTY CALM, COOL,

1132
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,130
AND COLLECTED.

1133
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,883
THIS WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR

1134
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,425
ME.

1135
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,302
IT WAS A HEARTBREAKING

1136
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,680
EXPERIENCE FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S A

1137
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,222
WELL FOUND BELIEF THAT WE'RE

1138
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,348
GOING TO MERGE TOMORROW.

1139
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,433
IT'S MIXED EMOTIONS IN THAT

1140
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,435
WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING DOWN IN

1141
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,645
NUMBER BUT WE'RE HOPING

1142
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,396
REDEMPTION ISLAND CAN WORK IN

1143
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,564
OUR FAVOR IN SOME WAY AND GET

1144
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,233
THE NUMBERS BACK UP TO 6-6.

1145
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,693
Jeff: DAWN, COCHRAN SAYS WE

1146
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,110
HOPE SOMEHOW REDEMPTION ISLAND

1147
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,152
WILL HELP US.

1148
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,112
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

1149
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,906
WELL, OUR HOPE IS THAT

1150
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,574
WHOEVER GOES TO REDEMPTION

1151
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,117
ISLAND CAN WIN THAT DUEL AND

1152
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,578
SEND HOME CHRISTINE AND RE-ENTER

1153
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,080
THE GAME, AND THEN THAT LEAVES

1154
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,916
US SIX UPOLU AND SIX SAVAII

1155
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,418
TRIBE MEMBERS.

1156
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,128
Jeff: SO, OZZY, YOUR PLAN

1157
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,754
IS WHOEVER WE VOTE OUT TONIGHT

1158
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,798
SHOULD GO TO REDEMPTION, TRY TO

1159
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,925
WIN, COME BACK AND REJOIN US.

1160
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,427
YEAH.

1161
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,803
Jeff: I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED

1162
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,929
BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING

1163
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,932
ON ONE HAND, COCHRAN, COCHRAN,

1164
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,934
COCHRAN, COCHRAN, COX RAN?

1165
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,518
YEAH.

1166
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,436
Jeff: WHY IS HE GOING TO

1167
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,937
PUT HIS LIFE ON THE LINE IF YOU

1168
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:30,313
VOTE HIM OUT?

1169
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,022
OF COURSE.

1170
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,608
THE THING ABOUT IT IS, JEFF, I'M

1171
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,776
PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE.

1172
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,611
Jeff: YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR

1173
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:36,903
LIFE ON THE LINE.

1174
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:37,528
YES.

1175
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,280
Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE

1176
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:39,614
GOING TO GO TO REDEMPTION

1177
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:39,864
ISLAND.

1178
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:40,573
YES.

1179
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,742
YOU CAN BASICALLY SAY I HAD A

1180
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,159
DREAM.

1181
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:43,951
I SAW THE MERGE.

1182
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,121
AND I SAW MY CHANCE AT MY OWN

1183
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,122
REDEMPTION, WHICH HAS BEEN

1184
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,123
HAUNTING ME SINCE THE LAST TIME

1185
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:49,832
I PLAYED.

1186
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,667
AND THAT'S BY NOT PLAYING THE

1187
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,294
IDOL, BY NOT LISTENING TO MY

1188
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,462
SENSES AND NOT LISTENING TO MY

1189
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,463
HEART AND MY GUT.

1190
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,465
AND THIS TIME MY HEART AND MY

1191
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,634
GUT IS SAYING GET YOUR ASS TO

1192
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,635
REDEMPTION ISLAND AND PROVE TO

1193
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,928
YOUR TRIBE THAT YOU ARE WORTH

1194
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:02,845
KEEPING IN THIS GAME.

1195
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,640
THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO NOT

1196
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,224
ONLY MAKE THE BALLSIEST MOVE I

1197
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:07,975
COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF, BUT TO

1198
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,019
PLAY THE BIGGEST, CRAZIEST GAME

1199
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,646
I WANT TO PLAY, AND NOT ONLY DO

1200
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,481
I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BUT I HAD

1201
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,484
THE IDOL.

1202
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,361
Jeff: YOU HAVE THE HIDDEN

1203
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:18,653
IMMUNITY IDOL?

1204
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,278
YEAH.

1205
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,696
Jeff: AND THIS ISN'T NEWS

1206
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,114
TO ANYBODY.

1207
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,700
SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE IDOL?

1208
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,493
I GIVE THE IDOL UP.

1209
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,828
AND THIS IS THE PART WHERE IT

1210
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,537
GETS INTERESTING.

1211
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,872
I'M GOING TO MAKE UP A STORY.

1212
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,832
I'M GOING TO TELL CHRISTINE,

1213
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,709
THAT COCHRAN, THE LITTLE SMART

1214
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,294
WEASEL HE IS THAT HAS BEEN TO

1215
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,713
HARVARD LAW AND WATCHES THE GAME

1216
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,006
RELIGIOUSLY, FOUND THE IDOL,

1217
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,341
KEPT IT FROM US, WE GO TO VOTE

1218
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,509
HIM OUT, HE WHIPS OUT THE IDOL,

1219
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,511
SEE YOU LATER, OZZY.

1220
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,471
NOT ONLY IS COCHRAN THE VILLAIN,

1221
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,556
BUT HE'S NOW THE DOUBLE AGENT.

1222
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,725
SO I THINK THAT THAT GIVES US

1223
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,478
THE BEST SHOT AT TAKING THEM BY

1224
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,813
SURPRISE AND POSSIBLY GETTING IN

1225
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,148
FRONT OF THIS GAME.

1226
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:56,607
Jeff: WHAT IF WE DON'T

1227
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,274
MERGE TOMORROW?

1228
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,734
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT

1229
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,027
WE DON'T MERGE.

1230
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,737
AND THAT THESE GUYS GO TO

1231
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,364
ANOTHER CHALLENGE WITHOUT ME.

1232
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,532
BUT AT LEAST I'VE GONE OUT ON MY

1233
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,534
TERMS, AND I HAVEN'T GONE OUT ON

1234
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,037
SOMEONE ELSE'S TERMS LIKE LAST

1235
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,705
TIME.

1236
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,747
Jeff: LET ME OFFER ANOTHER

1237
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,373
ARGUMENT.

1238
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,040
IF YOU DON'T WIN THE DUEL

1239
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,417
TOMORROW, YOU GO OUT A BIGGER

1240
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,003
FOOL THAN YOU DID LAST TIME.

1241
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:17,420
YEAH.

1242
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,047
Jeff: KEITH, ANY

1243
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,424
RESERVATIONS AT ALL ABOUT THIS?

1244
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,217
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE

1245
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,926
MOST VOCAL.

1246
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,053
I THINK THIS IS COCHRAN'S TIME

1247
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:26,762
TO REDEEM HIMSELF.

1248
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,973
AND IT'S HIS CHANCE TO KIND OF

1249
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,683
PROVE HIS WORTH TO THE TRIBE.

1250
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,892
Jeff: WHITNEY, WHAT'S YOUR

1251
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,560
TAKE ON THIS?

1252
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,229
YOU KNOW, OZZY'S ONE OF OUR

1253
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:36,230
STRONGEST PLAYERS.

1254
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:36,939
IF WE DO HAVE ANOTHER CHALLENGE

1255
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,566
BEFORE THE MERGE HAPPENS, WE'RE

1256
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,235
NOT AT OUR 100% WITHOUT OZZY.

1257
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,404
Jeff: JIM, WORST THING THAT

1258
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:43,904
HAPPENS TOMORROW MORNING WHEN

1259
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,531
YOU WAKE UP?

1260
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,576
OZZY LOSES AND WE HAVE TO GO,

1261
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,161
THE FIVE OF US STRONG, AGAINST

1262
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:54,290
THE SIX OF THEM.

1263
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:54,874
Jeff: WELL, IT IS

1264
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,792
DEFINITELY A RISKY MOVE.

1265
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,335
LET'S SEE IF YOU HAVE THE

1266
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:58,878
COURAGE TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

1267
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,214
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1268
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:10,931
KEITH, YOU'RE UP.

1269
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,518
22 SEASONS OF "SURVIVOR" I'VE

1270
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,271
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS,

1271
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,814
AND I'M THRILLED TO BE A PART OF

1272
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,900
IT, ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS

1273
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:26,447
SAVING MY ASS FOR ONE MORE TIME

1274
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:36,457
THANK YOU.

1275
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,501
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1276
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:45,633
VOTES.

1277
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,301
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1278
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,344
IMMUNITY IDOL THAT YOU WANT TO

1279
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,679
PLAY OR GIVE TO SOMEONE ELSE,

1280
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,640
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1281
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,267
UHM, I THINK I CHANGED MY

1282
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:55,976
MIND.

1283
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,019
I THINK I'M GOING TO LET COCHRAN

1284
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,522
GO TO REDEMPTION.

1285
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,775
JUST KIDDING.

1286
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,860
YOU'RE A BASTARD, MAN.

1287
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,320
HOLD ON TO IT, AND--

1288
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:07,530
IT'S GOING TO BE YOURS.

1289
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,448
YOU BETTER GIVE THAT TO ME.

1290
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,866
IT'S RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

1291
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,867
LET'S DO THIS.

1292
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,244
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, ONCE THE

1293
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,870
VOTES ARE READ THE DECISION IS

1294
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,538
FINAL.

1295
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,163
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1296
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:16,664
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1297
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,165
COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY.

1298
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,668
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1299
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:29,718
THE FIRST VOTE, OZZY.

1300
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,472
TWO VOTES OZZY.

1301
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,098
OZZY.

1302
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:38,477
THREE VOTES OZZY.

1303
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,813
