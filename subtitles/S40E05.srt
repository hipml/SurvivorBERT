The lions always go at it
all the time,

225
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,044
and the hyenas come from the
sidelines and-and win the game.

226
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,463
They take out the big lions
when they're wounded.

500
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,958
<i>I'm looking, I'm doing,</i>
<i>I'm trying to adapt</i>

501
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,586
<i>and do what these</i>
<i>new-school guys do,</i>

502
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,089
<i>but I just have</i>
<i>very little experience.</i>

503
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,091
<i>I'm not usually in this spot,</i>

504
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,093

508
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,272
<i>I underestimated 'em at first.</i>

509
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,691
I won't make that mistake again.

510
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,444
Did you guys already find it
or did I miss the...

511
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,945
-opportunity?
-Hey, empty your pockets.

512
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,405
Empty your pockets.

513
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,325
Yeah. No, no, no.

514
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,077

<i>So, I emptied my pockets</i>
<i>with the rest of them,</i>

515
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,497

00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,791
looking happy.

517
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,921
<i>Because while the whole group</i>

00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,297
<i>I found</i>

519
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,008
this lovely new bracelet.

520
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,849
<i>I was given half</i>

521
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,268
<i>And then I gave it back to Kim</i>
<i>before the swap.</i>

522
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:28,685
<i>But I can now see</i>

523
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,021
Kim's dilemma.

524
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,023
You did?

there were two big alliances

But there's always a crack.

883

The question is:
Is the crack big enough

884
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,410
that you can wedge
your fingers in there

885
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,413
and pull it apart
to take a look inside?

886
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,876
Um, the crack today was, like,
seven words long for me.

-What does that mean?
-SARAH: That's about

888

I mean, I feel like I had

891
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,426
the same experience.
I maybe got eight words.

892
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,721
I was expecting people
to go off in duos,

893
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,431
somebody to pretend to go get
firewood, looking for the idol.

894
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,935
Instead, these three marched off
to the well and came back,

895
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,478
and the whole mood of camp
had shifted.

896
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,315
Nobody looked at me.
Nobody talked to me.

897
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,817
There wasn't even a moment that
I could get one person alone.

898
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,277
And these are people,
the last couple days,

899
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,445
that I felt like
I was getting to know.

900
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,448
It was like, you know,
the command was down,

901
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,491
and that was it.

902
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,285
But I do take issue
a little bit,

903
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,786
Jeff, with the word "crack."

904
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,413
I feel like it implies
that Sarah and I

905
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,291
are, like, these invaders
trying to find weaknesses.

906
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,293
Like, "Where do I find the crack
that I get to wedge

907
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,461
my way in and screw you all up?"

908
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,131
But I see this as just as much
of an opportunity

909
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,382
to build real alliances.

00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,010

Rob, Sophie's comment
is a really interesting one.

916
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,485
I used the word "crack"--
it gets used a lot here--

917
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,654
that there's always something
between a group.

918
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,364
Sophie's point is, "There
doesn't have to be a wedge

919
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,450
"to provide an opportunity

920
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:28,037
to better everybody's situation,
including mine."

921
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,289
ROB:
And that's
a good selling point. I mean,

922
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,668
we weren't necessarily
a tight three.

923
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,836
I basically blindsided Adam.

924
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,798
Ben basically blindsided me.

925
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,218
We are probably
the most unlikely three

926
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,011
of Sele to sit here.

927
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,807
But the fact of the matter is
<i>Survivor's</i> a numbers game,

928
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,518
and with five people,
there's little room

929

in front of everybody,

932
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,193
"I blindsided Adam.
Ben blindsided me."

933
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,529
Is that trying to build trust,
to say, "There are no secrets,

934
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,031
-but we're still a three"?
-BEN: Jeff,

935
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,033
this has never been a situation
that I've been in

936

where there was
two easy vote outs.

937
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,872

comes a sense of security.

938
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,040

943
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,551
we went and had a talk
at the well,

944
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,263
and then we sat around camp
and talked about a lot of food,

945
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,224
uh, pies and-and cookies
and not a lot

946
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:32,518

947

949
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,398
how clever everybody is,
they're all winners,

950
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,318
and five of you are sitting
at camp, talking about cookies?

951
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,612
Yeah. I mean, sometimes,

952
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,032

read into that?

954
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,454
I mean, it's scary.

955
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:55,875
Rob won his season
by corralling people

956
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,753
and by keeping people
in the same mindset.

957
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,588
And a lot of that was just
keeping people together,

958

having a buddy system.
