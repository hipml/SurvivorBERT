5
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,396
Hidden deep in the jungle these

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,440
ruins are a monument to a once

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,859
powerful and sophisticated

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:31,072
civilization, the Maya.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,615
Best-known for their advanced

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,117
celestial knowledge and uncanny

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,369
ability to calculate time, the

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,538
Maya culture thrived and then

13
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,915
mysteriously vanished.

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,167
Today, these jungles are home to

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,086
exotic and dangerous wildlife--

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,297
jaguars, poisonous snakes and

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,549
crocodiles that lurk in every

18
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,633
body of water.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,259
It is an unforgiving

20
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,219
environment, where extreme

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,097
temperatures, high humidity

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,307
and torrential rainstorms

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,225
bring even the strongest

24
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,311
to their knees.

25
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,146
It is here that a group of

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,565
Americans have already begun the

30
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,947

together to create a new society

36
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,379
while battling the elements and

37
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,130
each other.

38
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,590
They must learn to adapt, or

39
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,257
they will be voted out of the

tribe.

41
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,885
In the end, only one will remain

It is going to be hot.

00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,520
There are poisonous snakes at

00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,313
every corner.

This is a marathon, not a

189
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,389

192
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,268

00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,313
Nakum, you will head up these

196
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,440
steps, follow the path to the

197
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,441
left.

198
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,360
Waiting for you is a compass and

199
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,361
a map.

200
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,072
You'll also find water, fruit,

201
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,365
bags of corn.

202
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,450
It is up to you to decide how

203
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,452
much you want to carry with you.

204
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,453
I'll be waiting for you at the

205
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,454
finish.

206
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,039
<i>Survivor: Guatemala</i> is set to

207
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,582
begin.

208
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,042
Survivors ready.

209
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:51,804
Go!

210
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,390
>> When we first saw all the

211
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:57,059
fruit, all the water, we had to

212
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,853
decide what stuff we were gonna

213
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,645
carry with us.

214
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,730
It was kind of a little bit of

215
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,315
mass chaos.

216
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,232
>> Grab the bananas.

217
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,067
>> Somebody bust something open

218
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,068
and let's eat it while we're

219
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,069
here.

220
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,946
>> None of us have ever talked

221
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,531
before, so to figure out a

222
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,491
strategy on the spur of the

223
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,160
moment was a little tough.

224
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,786
>> Take a thing of corn.

225
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,954
>> I say we just go ahead and

226
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:17,622
start going, guys.

227
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,290
>> Let's go, guys.

228
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,791
>> Being a farmer and

229
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,919
everything, the last time I

230
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,670
hiked 11 miles was never, but,

231
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,090
uh, I took off after 'em, you

232
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,383
know-- yeehaw!

233
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,887
You know, ready to do this, man.

234
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,555
>> Oh, yeah. Feels good.

235
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,224
>> We'll get over there, man.

236
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,099
Just lay down, relax.

237
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,100
>> Yup.

238
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:38,726
>> Just hang out, sing some

239
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,727
songs.

240
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,395
Being back in<i> Survivor,</i> I was

241
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:41,896
glad to get a new start.

242
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,232
I felt like a million bucks at

243
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,234
the beginning of the race.

244
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,151
But we've got to make time

245
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,569
because I guarantee you, Miss

246
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,570
Stephenie is over there running

247
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,571
things, and she won't, she won't

248
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:50,821
take time.

249
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,323
You drop it, you leave it, you

250
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,115
go.

251
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:53,699
>> So one person in the water.

252
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,910
(<i> overlapping voices</i> )

253
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,994
>> No, I'm all right.

254
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:57,787
>> All right.

255
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,664
>> My main fear coming into the

256
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,416
game was that, yes, I may be

257
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,210
sort of like a tool 'cause I-I

258
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,962
have experience and I kind of

259
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,922
came in almost like an outsider.

260
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,257
But Yaxha welcomed me with open

261
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,466
arms.

262
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,467
>> Stephenie, you're the reason

263
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,301
why I'm here.

264
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,427
>> Oh, stop it.

265
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,637
>> Totally awesome.

266
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,805
>> But I still have that

267
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,515
nervousness that maybe they will

268
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,724
see me as too threatening or

269
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,351
maybe I'm not as spectacular as

270
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,727
they thought I would have been.

271
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,312
And maybe they<i> do</i> want to just

272
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:23,938
get rid of me.

273
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:24,730
>> Let's roll.

274
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,940
>> Let's go.

275
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,316
>> How do you pronounce our

276
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,276
tribe?

277
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:28,609
>> Yasha.

278
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,444
>> Yasha.

279
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:40,663
>> Yasha.

280
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,707

>> We're gonna have a leader?

>> Why don't we leapfrog?

288
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,013
Go right for that big, tallest

00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,640
Blake...

291
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,767
>> Might need to come this way.

292
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,769
>> Come to your right, Blake.

293
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,729
>> What?

294
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,771
>> Come to your right.

295
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,023
The jungle, you know, you

296
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,441
can't move ten feet straight

297
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,442
ahead.

298
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,443
So, I put one of my tribesmen

299
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:10,693
ahead.

300
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,112
I'd have him walk up to a point

301
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:13,863
on my compass.

302
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,739
And then we all walked to him,

303
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,741
and it was slow going.

304
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,700
Can we see him, anybody?

305
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,327
>> Um...

306
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,286
>> No.

307
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:20,911
>> Oh, I see him, I see him.

308
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,829
Okay.

309
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,830
All right, stay right there.

310
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,372
Most of the people couldn't

311
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:23,873
read a compass.

312
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,167
I've done it before, you know,

313
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,543
in the Marine Corps, but you can

314
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,544
walk in circles in that stuff if

315
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,545
you don't do it right.

316
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:30,546
>> Is everybody here?

317
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,547
>> Yeah.

318
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,548
>> It's going to get too thick

319
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,549
to do this.

320
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,175
>> Well, it's gonna get too dark

321
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:34,759
to do it, is what's gonna

322

happen.

323
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,095

>> Hey, uh, Gary, you going the

332
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,071
right way?

333
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,696
>> Yeah, you're right.

334
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,864
>> That way. We go left.

335
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,948
>> Go right around 'em.

336
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,116
>> No question, straight south.

337
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,117
Go.

338
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:00,868

takes leadership.

342
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,250
And it was clear at the

343
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:08,793
beginning that Gary was our

344
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,710
leader.

345
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,296
He's taller than everyone.

346
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,381
He's gray-haired.

347
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,341
He was our leader, no question.

>> West through...

00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,134

now, north.

352
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,806
>> All right.

353

>> You know, they've asked me

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,726
what I do, so I told them I was

a landscaper.

356
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,062
15 years ago, I was in the

357

NFL for 11 years.

358
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,899
My real name is Gary Hogeboom,

359
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,817
but I don't think anybody needs

360
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,361
to know that, because I'd be

361
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,445
voted off immediately.

362
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:36,946
I don't see any markers.

363
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,823
What do you think?

364
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,199
If somebody does recognize me,

365
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,243
I'm just gonna say that's not

366
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,161
me.

00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:44,912

both took a compass and we were

the navigators, basically.

374
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,130
Make sure we're going the

00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,048
right way.

376
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:56,799

you know, miss a trail or

whatever.

But, uh, oh, my gosh, you know,

00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,825

you want to go, and just...

418
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,033
It was, by far, one of the

00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:36,472
>> Let's go.

574
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,265
>> We actually found the other

575
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,100
tribe, Nakum, which was great,

576
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,310
because we were... last we knew,

577
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,812
we were hours behind them.

578
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,938
>> Yaxha, come on.

579
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,314
>> Let's go, guys.

580
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,982
We got to move.

581
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,067
>> Come on, guys.

582
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,027
>> Meeting up in the jungle with

583
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,987
the other tribe took quite a bit

584
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,489
of air out of our balloon.

585
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,491
>> The other team's on our back.

586
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,659
>> Let's go.

587
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,828
>> Hey, we got road!

588
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:07,086
>> Yeah, baby!

589
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,337
>> Everybody coming?

590
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,088
We came out of the jungle

591
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,924
into a more open trail before

592
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,801
the other tribe, but they were

593
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,343
still right behind us.

594
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,303
>> Come on, Yaxha!

595
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,596
>> We cannot lose this entire

596
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,597
tribe.

597
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,599
>> We-We just wanted to get them

598
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,475
off our tails.

599
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,060
>> Come on, pick it up.

600
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,604
They're behind us.

601
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,980
It was like the movie<i> Sea</i>

602
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,148
<i>Biscuit,</i> when he sees his

603
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,942
competition and he kicks it in.

604
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:30,859
I was just like...

605
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,319
I felt like I couldn't put one

606
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,195
foot in front of me and all of a

607
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,531
sudden I'm running down this

608
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,824
trail in the muck.

609
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,034
>> We need to get right on their

610
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,452
ass, if not pass them.

611
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,703
>> Yeah. Come on, guys.

612
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,622
Push it.

613
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,957
We had Nakum.

614
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,250
They were right in front of us,

615
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,626
and then, all of a sudden, a

616
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,252
couple people, unfortunately, on

617
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,504
our tribe-- like Lydia and Amy,

618
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,964
who aren't as fit-- they were

619
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:52,548
kind of like lagging behind.

620
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,258
And it's a challenge that

621
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,717
you're only as strong as your

622
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,343
weakest link and we had to wait

623
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,261
for everybody till we could move

624
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,262
on.

625
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,097
And we had them.

626
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,765
They were right in front of us,

627
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,183
and we lost them completely.

628
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,268
>> You want me to take that

629
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:04,977
flag?

630
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,811
All right. Ready?

631
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,728
We're gonna do a slow jog

632
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:06,979
together.

633
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,021
Ready?

634
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,065
>> Yeah.

635
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,158
>> Let's go, Nakum.

636
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,161
>> Come on, Bobby Jon.

637
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,455
>> All of a sudden, I just got

638
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,332
cold as ice and my body

639
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,376
severely, severely cramped.

640
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:29,835
>> My hand's cramping.

641
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:30,419
>> Okay.

642
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,253
>> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

643
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,296
>> Okay, it's okay.

644
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,299
>> Get some water, please.

645
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,967
>> All right now.

646
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,468
>> Bobby Jon started getting

647
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,137
really bad cramps.

648
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,638
It's dehydration, overexertion.

649
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,182
He carried two bags of corn the

650
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,308
entire trek.

651
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,309
So, here comes Margaret the

652
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,603
nurse lady, and she just talked

653
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,437
him through it.

654
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,938
>> All right, I'm-I'm good.

655
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,856
>> Keep this leg...

656
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,857
Bend this leg up first.

657
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,858
>> Here you go, Bobby.

658
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,650
Okay.

659
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,735
>> I have to try. Let's go.

660
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,277
>> Okay.

661
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,278
>> I think people were

662
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,738
surprised, because this guy's in

663
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,405
better shape probably for this

664
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,741
and knows what to expect more

665
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,742
than anybody and he's going down

666
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,076
early.

667
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,536
I don't think anybody expected

668
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:04,745
that.

669
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,289
>> Okay?

670
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,668
>> Can we move faster, guys?

671
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,461
Can we move faster?

672
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,504
>> Yup.

673
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:14,838
>> All right.

674
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,464
>> How is everyone feeling?

675
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,341
>> You guys, everybody doing

676
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,050
okay?

677
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:18,800
>> Everybody good?

678
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,760
>> Yep.

679
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,761
>> Because we have a chance to

680
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,762
catch up with 'em.

681
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,388
>> Okay. Good job.

682
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,608
>> Hey, do I see water?

683
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,777
>> Guys, we're almost there.

684
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,698
>> Ow! Ow!

685
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,619
>> When I saw the boats, by that

686
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,037
time I was just absolutely

687
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,413
winded, but I knew that's the

688
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,207
light at the end of the tunnel.

689
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,209
Here we go.

690
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,210
>> "Paddle your canoe west-

691
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,795
southwest to the first wooden

692
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,379
pier, which is attached to the

693
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,130
stone steps.

694
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:57,714
Follow the path up to the Maya

695
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,549
ruins to the winners' camp."

696
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,051
>> All right, let's go, guys.

697
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:01,593
>> Everybody in, pile in.

698
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,637
When the other team shows up,

699
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,013
it's gonna be a race to the

700
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:14,439
finish.

701
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,440
>> Come on, guys, paddle.

702
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,151
Get it together.

703
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,069
>> Here they are.

704
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,696
>> There they are.

705
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,447
>> Guys, we have to pick it up.

706
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,199
Just stay hard.

707
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,200
Slow but hard.

708
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:26,326
(<i> shouting</i> )

709
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,703
>> Emerging from the jungle, we

710
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,996
see Nakum right there in the

711
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,998
middle of the lake.

712
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,290
We were so much closer than we

713
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,417
thought we were.

714
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,127
And we just booked it to our

715
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,752
canoe.

716
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,753
We knew we had caught up.

717
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,672
It was a huge morale booster.

718
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,423
>> Stroke.

719
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,882
>> Come on, guys.

720
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:49,641
>> Stroke.

721
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,684
>> I think we need to get in a

722
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,852
rhythm.

723
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,395
>> Never give up, guys, come on.

724
00:21:53,478 --> 00:22:04,489
Stroke.

possible.

us up.

>> We get to the dock, and old

Judd jumps out of the boat.

733
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,379
He had a premature evacuation.

734
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,132
And he gets into this mud that's

735
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,675
almost like quicksand.

736

Don't stop.

00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,559
You got it.

742
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,233
Come on!

00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:43,945

746
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,197
come on.

00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,116
Come on.

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,492
>> Pull.

751
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,118
>> Oh, my God.

752
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,079
Getting out of the boat was a

753
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,581
nightmare.

754
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,958
I knew it was dehydration, but

755
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,959
I've never felt that type of

756
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,002
pain before.

757
00:22:59,086 --> 00:22:59,544
I knew the other tribe was

758
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,963
definitely on our tail, so it's

759
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,465
kind of like you got to suck it

760
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,716
up.

761
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,927

the way there, we lose, so we

827
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,205
had to paddle all the way across

828
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:40,789

829
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,916

00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,299
>> We need to just make rounds

953
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,968
with them and give them water.

954
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,511
That's all we need to do.

955
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,011
The girls are holding up

956
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:42,887
remarkably well.

957
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,056
>> Big enough so you don't get

958
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,057
sick again.

959
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,892
>> But we didn't expect the guys

960
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,185
to go down so quickly.

961
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,603
Don't get up, lay down.

962
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,062
Stay down, stay down.

963
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,606
>> It was a bittersweet victory

964
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,441
because we won.

965
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,443
We got there first.

966
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,986
We got the fire and the best

967
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,778
camp, but some of us were in

968
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,531
such bad shape, you're thinking

969
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,241
if we lose 'em, it's not even

970
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:19,382
worth having all this.

971
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,051
>> Oh, my God, it's an oar.

972
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,974
>> Let's go back, let's go back.

973
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,559
>> "Your first two days were

974
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,894
grueling, but now is no time to

975
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,895
rest.

976
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,896
You've come too far to lose it

977
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,855
now.

978
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,981
This will put you to the test.

979
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,858
You'll be competing like the

980
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,859
Maya.

981
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,985
This is more than just a game.

982
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,945
Fail to pull your weight today,

983
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,364
and be the first to lose your

984
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,365
flame."

985
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,700
>> Okay, here's what I've

986
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:46,201
learned from my thing...

987
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,161
Uh, for me, this is really

988
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:48,912
exciting to have another chance

989
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,289
at immunity and possibly come

990
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,248
out with a victory.

991
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:52,874
Usually the person who steers

992
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,376
is one of the strongest, 'cause

993
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,836
they row both sides and steer.

994
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,671
But also it's a lot of pressure,

995
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,172
because if we lose this

996
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,508
challenge I'm going to be really

997
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:09,766
down.

998
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,226
>> Tree mail.

999
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,769
>> It says we're going to be

1000
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,853
competing like the Maya.

1001
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,355
>> Definitely our tribe not

1002
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,773
being in tip-top shape right now

1003
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,774
is a concern.

1004
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,816
>> We're all staying here

1005
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,359
tonight.

1006
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,360
>> Yeah.

1007
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:20,944
>> Nobody is going home.

1008
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:21,986
>> I think the girls

1009
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,446
right now are the strongest

1010
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,030
physically, but if our guys

1011
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,990
go up for this challenge

1012
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,534
and turn it on like no other

1013
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,993
then we're definitely going to

1014
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,163
have a good day today.

1015
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,218
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

1016
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,427
to your first immunity

1017
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,095
challenge?

1018
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:47,971
>> Yeah.

1019
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,222
>> PROBST: Let me show you what

1020
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,474
you're playing for.

1021
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,517
This is it.

1022
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,478
(<i> applause</i> )

1023
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,313
The game revolves around

1024
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,565
immunity.

1025
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,941
As long as you have it in your

1026
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,568
possession, whether as a tribe

1027
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,027
or an individual, you're safe.

1028
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,028
If not, you're in danger of

1029
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:04,988
going home.

1030
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:05,989
Okay, let's get to the

1031
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:06,281
challenge.

1032
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,616
It is based on the method that

1033
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,243
the Maya used for transporting

1034
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,286
materials to build their

1035
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,078
pyramids.

1036
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,329
Here's how it works.

1037
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,123
On my "go" all nine of you will

1038
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,082
paddle out in a boat, around a

1039
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,835
buoy, grab a torch, come back.

1040
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,670
Once you reach the shore, you'll

1041
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,463
drag your boat up the beach and

1042
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,715
attach it to a rope.

1043
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,508
At that point, four people will

1044
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,926
race up the hill and begin

1045
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,219
pulling on that rope.

1046
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,053
As you pull, you'll move the

1047
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,222
boat over a series of rolling

1048
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,223
logs.

1049
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,766
This is how the Maya did it.

1050
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,310
Every time you clear a log, four

1051
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,102
other people will take that back

1052
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,479
log and move it to the front.

1053
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,480
That'll keep the momentum

1054
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,481
going.

1055
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,733
That leaves one person left.

1056
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,192
Their sole responsibility is

1057
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,360
carrying that torch.

1058
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,112
Once the boat crosses the finish

1059
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:46,988
line the person with the torch

1060
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,865
lights the fire.

1061
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,325
The first tribe to get their

1062
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,784
flame lit wins immunity.

1063
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,703
For the losers, Tribal Council.

1064
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,663
First person will be voted out.

1065
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,290
Yaxha, you still need fire.

1066
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,541
Win this challenge,

1067
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,709
you get your fire.

1068
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,669
>> We're going to get it, guys.

1069
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,254
>> PROBST: Pick your spots.

1070
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,340
Wait for my "go."

1071
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,051
Here we go.

1072
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,969
For immunity, Survivors ready.

1073
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:10,970
Go.

1074
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:11,971
>> Let's go, guys. Let's go.

1075
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,016
>> Come on, guys.

1076
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,279
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

1077
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,405
>> PROBST: Both tribes out

1078
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,200
pretty even.

1079
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,285
>> Come on. Dig.

1080
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,370
>> Come on...

1081
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,996
>> Come on, you guys.

1082
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,125
(<i> shouting</i> )

1083
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,544
>> PROBST: Dead-even at the

1084
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,213
buoy; Yaxha has their torch.

1085
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,632
They're making their turn.

1086
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,216
Gonna have a collision.

1087
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,635
>> Nakum struggling at the

1088
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:54,514
buoy, trying to get their torch.

1089
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,139
Yaxha working well.

1090
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,601
Navigates through.

1091
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:02,021
Chance to take the lead.

1092
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,315
>> Come on, Yaxha.

1093
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,443
>> Row! Row! Row!

1094
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,278
>> Stroke!

1095
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,948
(<i> indistinct shouting</i> )

1096
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,282
>> PROBST: Very tight coming

Yaxha getting off their boat.

Nakum off their boat.

1100
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,832
Going to take strength

1101
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,250
and working together.

1102
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,085
Got to work together.

My foot, my foot is under the

1121

log.

is back ahead.

boat.

1129
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,133
Yaxha is really digging in.

1130
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,177
They've closed the gap.

1131
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,428
Both tribes are even.

1132
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,763
>> Push wit your legs.

1133
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,221

a lead.

1188
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,929

1194
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:28,853
myself.

We knew this challenge ought to

1201
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,444
be something brutal, and it

1202
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,237
turned out that it was.

1203
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,282

1216
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,883

1218
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,635

I mean, I definitely don't want

1223
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,893
any of the women to go yet and

1224
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,436
we've really shown that we have

1225
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,188
the endurance for 40 days.

1226
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,106
I mean, I feel fine, and we...

1227
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,816
I mean, all of us were able to

1228
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,360
stick through it really hard

1229
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,361

1246
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,636

1247
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,388
these crippled, you know,

1248
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,390
broke-down guys.

1249
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,933

1250
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,351
half of these people are even

1251
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,811

1252
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,312
Blake, he's all crippled up and

1253
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,522
his shoulder is like killing

1254
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,648
him.

1255
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,482
He's kind of, you know, still

1256

throwing up, and he's getting

1257
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,903
cramps really bad, and he's the

1258
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,738
one I'm most concerned about.

1259
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,447
>> You got to take a sip.

1260
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,033

1264

1265
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,791
back-- a third of your team is

1266
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,584
out-- you know, strategizing is

1267
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,044
a little bit tough.

1268
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,754
I really like Bobby Jon.

1269
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,923
I think he's a strong player.

1270
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,425
Jim, he's a great guy.

1271
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,384
He's got a lot of offer.

1272
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,510
I-I like Blake.

1273
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,512
In this tribe, they are all

1274
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,598
great people, but it's-it's all

1275
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,767
about who can help carry this

1276
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,061

1277
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,180
>> PROBST: Behind each of you is

Go ahead and grab a torch

1280
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,349
and approach the flame,

1281
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:12,767
because in this game

1282
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:18,105
fire represents your life.

1283
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,191
When your fire is gone, so are

1284
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,859
you.

1285
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:26,155
Take a seat.

1286
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,740
Before we get started, we have

1287
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,449
to acknowledge where we are.

1288
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,659
You're in the midst of the North

1289
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,660
Acropolis.

1290
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,578
These are authentic Maya ruins,

1291
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,247
and thousands of years ago this

1292
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,791
is a spot where leaders would

1293
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,501
decide the fate of their people.

1294
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,460
Couldn't be a more fitting spot

1295
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,419
for Tribal Council.

1296
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,838
All right, so let's get to it.

1297
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,506
This is the toughest beginning

1298
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,966
to any<i> Survivor</i> we've ever had.

1299
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,550
Blake, immediately your head

1300
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,886
just went down like, "Yeah, I

1301
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,845
know."

1302
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,554
>> It's been pretty tough, Jeff.

1303
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,973
That first day, you know, Bobby

1304
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:53,599
Jon, myself and Jim and Judd, we

1305
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,768
were cramping all up and down

1306
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,269
and sick to our stomachs and

1307
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,687
couldn't keep anything down and

1308
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,605
dehydration, and...

1309
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,232
it was definitely a hard start

1310
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,441
to this adventure, for sure.

1311
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,026
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, how about

1312
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,152
for you?

1313
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:05,694
>> I don't like getting beat

1314
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,570
down like that this early in the

1315
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,739
game.

1316
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,740
I've never had that happen to me

1317
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,658
before.

1318
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,575
I mean, I know I could be saying

1319
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,493
sayonara tonight.

1320
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,619
I hope... I hope to God I don't

1321
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,620
have to.

1322
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,956
I mean, not many people get

1323
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:17,957
two chances to win a million

1324
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,208
bucks.

1325
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,918
>> Danni, looking at this group,

1326
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:21,502
you've got a lot of young,

1327
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,254
strong guys.

1328
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,922
You had you to be a little

1329
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,841
surprised to see four of your

1330
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,633
five guys on their back.

1331
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,552
>> Well, I was a-a little

1332
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,053
surprised, but I think a lot of

1333
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:31,679
times guys have more physical

1334
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,806
strength, but women tend to have

1335
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,890
a little more endurance.

1336
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,433
Maybe that played a part of it,

1337
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,685
but also, they were carrying at

1338
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,270
the beginning, a lot of the load

1339
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,604
and so they were throwing up and

1340
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,605
getting sick and that's going to

1341
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,731
happen.

1342
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,732
That's just part of the game.

1343
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,900
>> PROBST: Judd, you come out.

1344
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,152
If I'm looking, I'm thinking,

1345
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:46,777
"All right, I've got to rely on

1346
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,529
Judd," especially through this

1347
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,905
trek and some of these physical

1348
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,906
challenges and you're on your

1349
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,824
back.

1350
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:52,950
You have to be thinking "Am I in

1351
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:53,659
trouble?"

1352
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,660
>> Not at all.

1353
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,661
I mean, I was... I was only on

1354
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,954
my back for like an hour at the

1355
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:57,830
most.

1356
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,248
I mean, I got right over it.

1357
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,624
I puked and I got up and I went

1358
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,042
to do what I had to do, man.

1359
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,127
I mean, I don't know what to

1360
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,253
tell you.

1361
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,421
I'm ready to do a back flip if

1362
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,088
you want me to.

1363
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,131
I mean, I feel great.

1364
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:07,715
>> PROBST: Wow, I just asked a

1365
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,341
simple question.

1366
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,635
(<i> laughing</i> )

1367
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,720
Let's talk about today's

1368
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,512
challenge.

1369
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,513
Jim, so what is up with your

1370
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,265
arm?

1371
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:16,974
'Cause you've made a

1372
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,350
homemade sling over there.

1373
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,810
>> Yeah, first thing out of the

1374
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,228
chute when we picked up the

1375
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,229
boat, I grabbed it with my left

1376
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,230
arm.

1377
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:23,814
And I was under the impression

1378
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,983
everybody else had ahold of it.

1379
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:26,567
Sure didn't, and it just tore

1380
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,444
that bicep muscle.

1381
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,612
>> PROBST: When did you know?

1382
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,821
Did you know instantly?

1383
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,697
>> I knew when I picked it up.

1384
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,033
It popped. I heard it pop.

1385
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:34,617
I was 50%, but I'm not blaming

1386
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,576
it on my arm.

1387
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,370
When you don't have everybody at

1388
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,622
100%, it's going to hurt.

1389
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,623
It's going to hurt the-the

1390
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:40,831
tribe.

1391
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,042
>> PROBST: Margaret, three days

1392
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,043
in, a lot of people have taken

1393
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:44,960
lumps.

1394
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,503
What thoughts have you been

1395
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,130
thinking about in terms of "What

1396
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,715
do we need to do in this game?"

1397
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,716
>> I mean, all of us are very

1398
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,510
worried about how to pace our

1399
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,304
team to put us in the winning

1400
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,056
position for both the rewards

1401
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,766
and not to be here at Tribal

1402
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,725
Council, so we<i> are</i> trying to

1403
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,269
realign our priorities and

1404
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,146
conserve energy, keep ourself

1405
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,023
healthy and think straight, so

1406
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,192
that's what I see coming.

1407
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,193
>> PROBST: Okay.

1408
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,028
It is time to vote.

1409
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,489
Blake, you're up.

1410
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:29,797
>> One of the toughest dudes I

1411
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,300
know.

1412
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,690
>> I know you're a fighter, and

1413
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,275
I know you don't want to quit,

1414
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:49,817
but I have to make this vote

1415
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,027
thinking of the team for long

1416
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,072
term.

1417
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,878
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1418
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,339
votes.

1419
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,683
Once the votes are read, the

1420
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,934
decision is final.

1421
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,102
The person voted out will be

1422
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,145
asked to leave the Tribal

1423
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,229
Council area immediately.

1424
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,772
I'll read the votes.

1425
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,276
First vote...

1426
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,820
Jim.

1427
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,867
Jim. Two votes Jim.

1428
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,371
Jim.

1429
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,915
That's three votes Jim.

1430
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,794
Jim.

1431
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,921
Four votes Jim.

1432
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,925
First person voted out

1433
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,177
of<i> Survivor: Guatemala</i> -- Jim.

1434
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,845
That's five. That's enough.

1435
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:03,057
You need to bring me your torch.

1436
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:10,564
Jim, the tribe has spoken.

1437
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:11,774
Time for you to go.

1438
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,776
>> Thanks, Jim.

1439
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,779
>> Thanks, Jimbo.

1440
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,994
>> PROBST: You have 36 more days

1441
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,080
out here, and it seems like the

1442
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,248
dilemma for this tribe is how to

1443
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,750
give it your all without

1444
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,709
destroying yourself in the

1445
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,752
process.

1446
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,004
Grab your torches and head back

1447
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:34,963
to camp.

1448
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:35,964

about Blake.

1470
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,542
He's struggling to get breaths,

1471

and something's not right.

surprised by the outcome of all

1474
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,094
this, you know, given the

difficulty of this game and, you

1476
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,055
know, being an older guy.

1477

get out and do things-- you

1481
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,312
know, do something for yourself.

1482
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,313
I don't blame the guys for

1483
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,148
voting me out.

1484
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,232
