JEFF PROBST:
<i>Tonight on a special episode</i>

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,257
<i>of</i> Survivor: Thailand,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,051
<i>we'll take a look back</i>
<i>at the first 30 days,</i>

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>through highlights</i>
<i>and never-before-seen footage.</i>

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:19,310
JAKE:<i> You know, the canoe weighs</i>
<i>2,321 pounds, I'm convinced.</i>

6
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,979
<i>That was the worst canoe</i>
<i>I've ever been in</i>

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>in my entire life.</i>

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,608
How many of you vote
for burning the ... canoe?!

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,653
-Ooh.
-JAN:<i> Clay.</i>

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,946
He's an ass man, apparently.

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,449
(Clay whoops)

12
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,743
It's just part
of Clay's personality.

13
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,120
CLAY:
<i>Erin's a neat girl, and</i>

14
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,456
isn't she a bubba-loo.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,624
Damn. Mmm.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,126
(humming)

17
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,170
GHANDIA:
<i>I like the whole model scene,</i>

18
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,297
you know, 'cause I'm fine,
I realize that.

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,632
Do the camera. Do the camera.
(imitates clicking)

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,343
TED:
<i>We call Ghandia the Diva Queen.</i>

21
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,511
Then I'll whip out the camera

22
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,471
and say, "Oh, work it,
work it, girl."

23
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,098
"Who she think she is,
calling her diva?"

24
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,475
Uh, hello!

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,102
I'm a diva, and you're not.

26
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,379
PROBST:
<i>On day one,</i>

27
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,215
<i>the survivors left</i>
<i>a small fishing village</i>

28
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,385
<i>as a group of men</i>
<i>and a group of women.</i>

29
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,055
<i>Right from the start, they knew</i>
<i>there would be some surprises.</i>

30
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,016
JOHN:<i> We came in and walked</i>
<i>through this ancient Thai</i>

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,935
fishing village,
got on our boats--

32
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,937
<i>men in one, women in</i>
<i>the other-- which of course,</i>

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,064
<i>led us to believe that</i>
<i>the tribes were going to be</i>

34
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,232
<i>the men against the women.</i>

35
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,025
PROBST:
<i>But they soon learned</i>

36
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,110
<i>that wasn't the case.</i>

37
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,195
You're going to choose
your own tribes, right now.

38
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,781
<i>In keeping</i>
<i>with the Thai tradition</i>

39
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,742
<i>of honoring the elders,</i>
<i>Jake and Jan, the two oldest,</i>

40
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,453
<i>were allowed</i>
<i>to pick their own tribes.</i>

41
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,789
When Jeff said that
we were picking the tribes,

42
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,585
<i>I was scared, because, um,</i>
<i>I'm not really a leader.</i>

43
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,921
JAKE:<i> I like to see</i>
<i>athletic-looking people, so,</i>

44
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,423
<i>I based picking the team on</i>

45
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>just that gleam</i>
<i>in their eye that looks</i>

46
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,093
<i>like they'd be there</i>
<i>for the duration.</i>

47
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,763
PROBST:<i> Jan chose</i>
<i>an older group for Chuay Gahn,</i>

48
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,726
<i>while Jake went with youth</i>
<i>and brawn for Sook Jai.</i>

49
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,728
JAKE:
<i>You know, I've got a crew</i>

50
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,980
<i>that's totally enthusiastic</i>
<i>and ready to go.</i>

51
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,774
You can totally
swing on this, guys.

52
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,984
JAKE:
<i>But they know</i>

53
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:13,860
nothing.

54
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,783
PROBST:<i> At Chuay Gahn,</i>
<i>the tribe was quick</i>

55
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,619
<i>to make use of</i>
<i>the natural cave,</i>

56
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,663
<i>while John was quick</i>
<i>to delegate chores.</i>

57
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,540
-This'll be...
-You see? That's not dry, and...

58
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,000
You don't think it's dry enough?

59
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,960
-No, sir. We got plenty of that.
-All right.

60
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,671
CLAY:<i> John's over trying</i>
<i>to start a fire, and he wants</i>

61
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,840
to sit there and not go out
and hunt for the dry stuff.

62
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,300
He keeps telling everybody

63
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,676
<i>to go hunt the dry stuff, but</i>
<i>he wants to sit there and try</i>

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,596
<i>to strike leaves. He needs</i>
<i>to get up and go try to find</i>

65
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,597
<i>some dry stuff.</i>

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,681
<i>Everybody is hunting for that,</i>

67
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,183
except him,
and he's sitting there

68
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,434
saying, "You can't strike it,
you can't strike it."

69
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,602
JAN:
We got fire!

70
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,811
HELEN:
Don't-Don't count your chickens.

71
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,104
-Getting the fire is easy.
-TED: Oh.

72
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,482
-Getting the dry stuff to, uh,
burn is-- -Gettin' it to ignite.

73
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,984
CLAY:<i> John-- he's already pissed</i>
<i>everybody off.</i>

74
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>Everything you do: "Oh, no, no,</i>
<i>no. Oh, no, no. Oh, no, no."</i>

75
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,739
<i>We had all the stuff</i>
<i>to start a fire.</i>

76
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,157
<i>Well, he decided that wasn't</i>
<i>good, so he thought...</i>

77
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,118
<i>And he wants to sit there, and</i>
<i>everybody go find him fire.</i>

78
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,663
What would happen if we just
chop up what we have, or...?

79
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,165
That would work, except
it just doesn't ignite quickly.

80
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, I got a real good idea.

81
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,293
We're-We're gathering bamboo,

82
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,670
we're gathering coconuts
and all this.

83
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,838
If we don't have this,
ought to go find some.

84
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,507
Then come right back
and do it.

85
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,052
<i>Okay, you want us to go gather</i>
<i>the straw to-to make your fire,</i>

86
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,389
do all this, and you're going
to sit here and look at this.

87
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,015
Why don't you come help us?

88
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,976
This won't work?
This right here won't work?

89
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,227
JAN:
Clay?

90
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,187
I'll start that damn...

91
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,355
-Oh! Oh!
-There you go.

92
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,024
-There, that...
-Oh!

93
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,069
CLAY:<i> John? No, me and John</i>
<i>don't think alike a lot.</i>

94
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,197
<i>As far as compassion to family,</i>
<i>we think a lot alike,</i>

95
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,325
<i>but wilderness, outdoor</i>
<i>surviving, we don't think</i>

96
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,369
<i>alike at... at all.</i>

97
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,210
Let's go to the beach.

98
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,420
PROBST:
<i>When night fell,</i>

99
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,130
<i>the mood</i>
<i>at Sook Jai was upbeat.</i>

100
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,923
ROBB:
<i>We were so excited about</i>

101
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,216
the team that we ended up with,

102
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,217
<i>we all decided to come down</i>

103
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,552
<i>to the beach</i>
<i>and just check it out.</i>

104
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,220
(laughing)

105
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,221
Stephanie even got naked.

106
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,222
Oh, my God, are you naked?

107
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,432
Fixin' to be.

108
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,351
Oh, my God, she is wild,
she is crazy.

109
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,894
You look good in the moonlight.

110
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,688
-It suits you.
-Well, thank you.

111
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,903
PROBST:<i> But on day two, Sook</i>
<i>Jai's happy mood began to sour,</i>

112
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,364
<i>when the tribe clashed</i>
<i>over priorities.</i>

113
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,366
ROBB:<i> So many people are going</i>
<i>in so many directions</i>

114
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,201
and doing stuff, and it's...
they're not producing anything.

115
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,786
-Let me see your hands!
-I understand your hands.

116
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,580
-Let me see your hands! -Dude,
I was told to go get food, okay?

117
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,707
Okay, I'm not saying that,
sweetie. Let me see your hands.

118
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,292
-That's my point, dude.
-Listen.

119
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,418
I'm not here
to be yelled at by you.

120
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,419
Pick up something, dude.
I'm not yelling at you, sweetie!

121
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,420
I'm saying, I want to sleep
tonight, okay?

122
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,756
How'd you sleep last night?
Pretty good, huh?

123
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,591
My point, exactly. Walk away.

124
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,051
SHII ANN:
<i>You do not mess with</i>

125
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,762
the Shii-Devil and not get
the horns, okay?

126

00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,813
<i>And the tribe got lost looking</i>

129
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,607
HELEN: There's no way that if
this is the water source that

we're supposed to be able to
come up here every couple days

131

with a big, huge gallon jug

132
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,112
and fill it up
and go back down again.

133
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,074
So I-I don't think
we're on the right track.

134
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,786
Here we go, guys.
Immunity at stake.

135
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,287
Survivors ready?

136
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,413
Go!

137

PROBST:<i> At the first</i>
<i>immunity challenge,</i>

<i>Chuay Gahn made the hike</i>

<i>John, who was feeling secure.</i>

151
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,826

<i>And he picked up that card</i>

John.

this bump in the pit

161
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,809
You know, your name resonates
in a way it never has before.

<i>Then when he turned the other</i>
<i>one over</i>

<i>there was an alliance</i>
<i>that I was left out of.</i>

170
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,033
That's four votes, John,
and that's enough.

171
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,368
You need to bring me your torch.

172
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,871
<i>You almost want to jump up</i>

"That's enough humiliation.

174
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,915
This hurts too bad."

175
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,835
John, the tribe has spoken.

176
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,839
<i>I mean, I came in</i>

180
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,812

TED:
<i>My luxury item is</i>

182
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,442
a shaving kit.

183
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,161
<i>I usually shave my head every</i>
<i>three days, and in this world,</i>

184
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,789
<i>every three days is the Tribal</i>
<i>Council, so...</i>

185
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,792
I figure to start
a new, renewed spirit after

186
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,878
<i>each Tribal Council,</i>
<i>I'm going to shave my head.</i>

00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,382
-Oh...!
-Looking good!

189
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,592
He's got his own routine
going on.

190
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,135
Got the shaving,
got the beauty stuff.

191

He's probably got--
I'm sure he's got

192
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,223
facials and manicures
as well as pedicures.

193
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,557
Whatever.

194
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,226

203

STEPHANIE:<i> 'Cause right now,</i>
<i>Jed's pretty much taking care</i>

207

<i>of food and I've been</i>
<i>primarily the water.</i>

208
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,929
<i>So, if you took the two of us</i>
<i>out of the equation,</i>

209
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,515
I'm not sure
how the other six would do.

<i>At one point,</i>
<i>I was about ready to--</i>

<i>if I had a pistol</i>
<i>in my pocket,</i>

00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,634
-This is much better than
our shelter, I think. -Really?

665
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,177
SHII ANN:
Wow, this is your bed?

666
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,512
-Yeah.
-Did you guys build this?

667
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,513
Yes, we did.

668
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,681
There it is.

669
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,890
KEN:
<i>How about you guys?</i>

670
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,350
How is it set up over there?

671
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,977
Same type of water hole,
but like I said,

672
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,021
you got to swim
at least a mile to it.

673
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,064
PROBST:<i> When the four</i>
<i>ambassadors returned,</i>

674
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,567
<i>they had a decision to make.</i>

675
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,820
The two tribes will now
live together on one beach.

676
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,198
The question is, which beach
are you going to live on?

677
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,366
-Looks like we're going
to Chuay Gahn. -Chuay Gahn.

678
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,784
Going to Chuay Gahn, all right.

679
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,202
One, two, three.

680
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,370
Family!

681
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,663
(cheering)

682
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,000
It was a huge successful merger
of two tribes.

683
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,084
I don't want to be...

684

710
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,972
I never would have expected
our merge

711
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,058
to have gone
as smoothly as it has.

712
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,768
-You said, "merge."
-Yes.

713
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,602
I certainly didn't say anything

714
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,104
to give you that impression,
did I?

715
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,814
What I said to you guys
when you left is,

716
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,317
"Two tribes will live together
on the same beach."

717
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,112
The two tribes never merged.

718
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,364
<i>Strategies were thrown</i>
<i>into turmoil.</i>

719
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,992
<i>And for some, immunity became</i>
<i>more important than ever.</i>

720
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:23,952
Shii Ann!

721
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,745
HELEN:
All right, Shii Ann.

722
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,790
<i>That night, it was Chuay Gahn</i>
<i>who escaped the vote.</i>

723
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,584
Chuay Gahn wins immunity!

724
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,674
<i>Sook Jai went directly</i>
<i>to Tribal Council,</i>

725

<i>and Shii Ann found herself</i>
<i>in the hot seat.</i>

726
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,679
ERIN: Some people weren't
being true to our tribe,

727
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,140
and it is kind of disheartening

728
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,766
thinking that,
you know, your tribe

729
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,184
that you thought you trusted

730
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,812
now is starting to really
look out for themselves.

731
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,815
PROBST:<i> Shii Ann made</i>
<i>a desperate play for her life</i>

732
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,942
<i>and tried to target Penny.</i>

733
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:59,988
Penny, you're manipulative,
because-- I know you don't--

734
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,157
I know that that's not
a-a pleasant word,

735
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,117
but it's the way
that you've played the game.

736
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,163
If we go back today
and I'm out, and not Penny,

737
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,124
that's going to leave another
impression with those guys.

738

PROBST:<i> But Shii Ann's plea</i>
<i>didn't work.</i>

739

Shii Ann.

SHII ANN:
<i>My last Tribal Council</i>

741

00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,888
I shook up everyone in Sook Jai.

743
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,764
I let it all come out.

744
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,975
Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken.

745
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,936
Good luck, you guys.

746
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,813
<i>I stirred up the pot</i>
<i>so badly last night,</i>

747

748

"I'm liberated!"

750
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,488
The Shii-Devil is here.

751

I'm here to serve a little
trouble for all the rest of you.

752
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,911

PROBST:<i> On day 22,</i>

Whew.

765
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,074

BRIAN:
Oh, yeah.

767
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,410
I didn't know if you--
I just got to clue you in.

768

-I'm a little older,
little wiser. -No, trust me,

769

-Whew.
-I know who you're going to be

CLAY:
Ain't no doubt about it.

I must remind myself.

No, Erin,

them ol' butts that just...

Them ol' race horses
prancing out there.

782
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,892

difficult thing to do.

830
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,583
BRIAN:
<i>Fishing was extremely tough.</i>

831
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,709
<i>We don't have the right</i>
<i>equipment to spear.</i>

832
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,295
Only thing we've got
is the right snorkel and fins.

833
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,297

836
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,059
Only two people left
in the water:

837
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,937
Brian for Chuay Gahn,
Jake for Sook Jai.

838
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,023
The only way Sook Jai can win
is if Jake

839
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,192
stays under the water
longer than Brian.

840
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,403
<i>But Jake faltered before Brian.</i>

841
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,404
Jake is up.

842
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,239
Chuay Gahn wins immunity.

843
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,118
<i>Sook Jai would be</i>

<i>Tribal Council in a row.</i>

845
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:20,623
Do we want to go ahead
and reveal who's going tonight?

846
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,084
I would only want to know
if everybody's in agreement

847
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,627
that that's what
we're going to do.

848
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,878
It's got to be unanimous.

849
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,798
-PENNY: Let's just save it for
Tribal Council, then. -Yeah.

KEN:<i> I kind of laughed</i>

851
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,136
and I'm fighting back tears?

852
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,929
<i>I used to compare this</i>

First member of our jury-- Erin.

ERIN:<i> The biggest lesson</i>

<i>going into the game,</i>
<i>the Sook Jai tribe</i>

859
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,947
got really big heads
from the very beginning.

860
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,490
We thought that our tribe was

861
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,909
<i>stronger, thinking,</i>
<i>"Oh, you know,</i>

862

ERIN:<i> Sook Jai thought</i>
<i>that they were--</i>

865
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,168
<i>we were a very strong tribe,</i>
<i>and once we actually went</i>

866
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,129
<i>to live with the Chuay Gahn</i>
<i>members, we realized that</i>

867
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,299
<i>they were a much closer tribe</i>
<i>than... than we were.</i>

868
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,468
<i>So I think</i>
<i>my biggest lesson was</i>

869
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,761
<i>don't take anything</i>
<i>for granted.</i>

870
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,305
<i>You know, first impressions</i>
<i>aren't always true.</i>

871
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,114
Sleep tight, everyone.

872
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,014
Oh!

873
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,015

<i>next to me,</i>
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>

876
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,524
I heard this racket.

877
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,692
Came right up
and hit me on the head.

878
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,569
<i>And it took off</i>
<i>and then I could hear it again.</i>

879
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,862
(making buzzing noises)

880
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,114
<i>Sounded like it had, like,</i>
<i>ten wings or something.</i>

881
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,742
It's not a bat?

882

(making buzzing noises)

884
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,706
Here it came back.

885
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,708
It's back. (muttering)

886
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,088
CLAY:<i> Jake and Brian</i>
<i>got attacked by a bug.</i>

887
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,132
<i>It was pretty funny.</i>
<i>I never saw it or heard it,</i>

888
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,716
but I'm going to tell you what,

889
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,386
it kept them excited
for a little while last night.

890
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,014
JAKE:<i> I leaped up and swatted</i>
<i>something. I didn't know</i>

891

what I was swatting.

892
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,726
<i>I don't have any idea</i>
<i>what it was.</i>

893

PROBST:<i> On day 26,</i>

894
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,526
<i>when the two tribes</i>
<i>finally merged.</i>

895
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,570
You're probably assuming

896

these gold buffs
are for your new tribe?

897
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,116
Finally, an assumption
that's right.

(cheering)

899
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,202
Sook Jai and Chuay Gahn
are no more.

900
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:07,081
The eight of you are now
one tribe, from here to the end.

JAKE:<i> You know, I guess, the</i>
<i>thing that bothered me most is</i>

996
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,311
<i>Penny came up and snuffed me</i>
<i>right from the very beginning.</i>

997
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,563
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>I guess she had her reasons.</i>

998
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,315
<i>I don't know what they were.</i>

999
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,943
Helen says B, Vietnam.
That is right.

1000
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,319
Snuff his torch.

1001
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:06,403
I'm sorry, Ted.

1002
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,322
PROBST:<i> But it was Helen</i>
<i>who walked away</i>

1003
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:09,990
<i>with the immunity necklace.</i>

1004
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,035
Guaranteed a one-in-six shot
at being the sole Survivor.

1005
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,040
<i>At Tribal Council,</i>
<i>Penny learned</i>

1006
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,126
<i>that her betrayal</i>
<i>had backfired.</i>

1007
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,628
<i>The former members</i>
<i>of Chuay Gahn targeted her,</i>

1008
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,505
<i>and she was voted</i>
<i>out of the tribe.</i>

1009
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,842
The tenth person voted out
of the tribe: Penny.

1010
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,512
PENNY:<i> I knew that I had</i>
<i>a very little amount of time</i>

1011
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:36,183
to work with to be able
to try to, um, rescue myself.

1012
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,354
<i>I was really trying to get</i>
<i>to know Chuay Gahn very well,</i>

1013
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:44,358
<i>because I felt threatened</i>
<i>that I was going to be going.</i>

1014
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,235
Penny, the tribe has spoken.

1015
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,487
<i>It's an uncomfortable feeling.</i>

1016
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,866
<i>Knowing that</i>
<i>you don't have complete control</i>

1017
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,869
<i>over your destiny is definitely</i>
<i>not a good feeling, because</i>

1018
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,038
<i>you want to survive another</i>
<i>three days on the island.</i>

1019
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,922
PROBST:<i> 16 castaways</i>
<i>came to Thailand</i>

1020
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,049
<i>seeking the adventure</i>
<i>of a lifetime.</i>

1021
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,677
<i>Now, only six remain.</i>

1022
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,389
<i>How will Ted, Jake, Jan,</i>

1023
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:20,728
<i>Helen, Brian and Clay</i>
<i>fare over the final nine days?</i>

1024
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,605
<i>What bonds will they make?</i>

1025
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,024
<i>What experiences</i>
<i>will they share?</i>

1026
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,401
<i>How will their actions</i>
<i>affect the jury?</i>

1027
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:29,737
<i>And who will</i>
<i>outlast all the rest</i>

1028
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,031
<i>to become the sole Survivor?</i>

1029
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,159
<i>Join us next week</i>
<i>back at our regular time.</i>

1030
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,962
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

1031
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,383
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor...

1032
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,928
<i>Clay speaks his mind to Jake.</i>

1033
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,221
I didn't like that statement
worth a ...

1034
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,597
up there at that council
meeting.

1035
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,725
HELEN:<i> I don't think Clay</i>
<i>liked that because it's true.</i>

1036
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,602
Jake does more work than Clay.

1037
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,646
PROBST:
<i>And a reward with a twist.</i>

1038
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,606
Today, we're going to
change things up a little bit.

1039
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,441
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1040
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:08,817
Stay seated.

1041
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,575
Start, finish.

1042
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,245
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1043
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,121
Now go.

1044
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,124
-Okay.
-Okay.

1045
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,626
-Oh!
-(groans)

1046
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,627
(laughter)

1047
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,254
Close.

1048
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,464
Yeah.

1049
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,926
-Oh!
-(laughter)
