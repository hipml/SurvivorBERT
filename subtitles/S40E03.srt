<i>At this point,</i>

738

<i>the most dangerous person</i>

me and him are like that.

802

-Fine.
-Are you good with that?

803
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,706
Yeah, I guess we could.

804

<i>ROB:</i>
<i>Adam's forcing my hand.</i>

<i>If somebody's coming after one</i>
<i>of my alliance members,</i>

806
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,503
I'm coming after them.

807
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,130
He told me the whole plan.

808
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,049
-PARVATI: He told you it's me?
-He told me it's you.

809
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,676
-He told you it's me?
-I'm supposed to be
good with it.

810
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,221
All right, if we're voting Adam,
I'm down to do that.

811
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,682
<i>Because Adam broke</i>

812

the cardinal rule of<i> Survivor</i>

813
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,144

814
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,022
<i>who's aligned with the person</i>
<i>who you're planning</i>

815

<i>it's got to be Adam.</i>

819

820

<i>I'm ready to pounce on Adam,</i>
<i>devour that guy</i>

821
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,495

822
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,082
MICHELE:
Yeah. I think

823
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,377
it has to be one of them.

824
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,213
-In my opinion.
-You think Parv?

825
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,010
The benefit of going Ethan...

826
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,471
-Ethan will be weakening Rob.
-Yeah.

827
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,555
<i>Right now</i>

828
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,682
it seems absolutely essential

829
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,224
that we break up the trio--

830
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,518
Rob, Ethan and Parvati,

831
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,937
because they're
running the show.

832
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,564
<i>But it pisses me off</i>
<i>that Adam would go</i>

833
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,066
scurry on over to Rob
and tell him the whole plan

834
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,110

and throw me and Jeremy

835
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,278
<i>under the bus.</i>

836
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,239

But we got back to camp.

872
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,021
There was probably
about 40 minutes of silence

Ethan, losing does make

887
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,549
unity very hard to find.

888
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,885
And when you don't have it,
people, out of desperation,

889
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,428
-start to just look out
for themselves.
-ETHAN: Yeah.

890
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,099
You know, certain people
are working with certain people,

891
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,351
and information comes to you
in a variety of different ways.

892
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,396

ADAM:
Yeah. Ethan sort of hit it,

896
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,279
which is everybody is close
to somebody on this tribe.

897
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,239
And so the concept

898
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,158
of coming together
in one clean vote

899
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,285

even within a fractured tribe?

906
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,047
I mean,
it's kind of like dating.

-That's how
I'm seeing it right now.
-(chuckles)

908
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,301
Like, the people
who make me feel

909
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,720
really giddy, those are

910
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,679
the people
that I'm gonna roll with.

911
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,265
And hopefully,
they have the same feeling,

912
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,474
and they choose me, too.

913
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,228
PROBST:
Rob, is that a fair analogy
in that sometimes,

914
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,898
it really is just a feeling,

915
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,649
-a gut?
-ROB: Yeah.

916
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,944
This is a game
where you have to trust someone,

917
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,947
but inherently, you're
not supposed to trust anybody.

918
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,617
So tonight, you have to put

919
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,786
your trust in other people

920
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,955
and hope that they're
gonna do the right thing.

921
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,541
And maybe they do,
maybe they don't.

922
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,419
But you really don't know
until after you vote.

PROBST:
Parvati, does that
bode well for you?

924
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:56,964
It's a little different
for me, Jeff,

925
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,425
because I'm walking around
as, like,

926
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,968
a billboard target.

927
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,970
If people want to work with me,

928
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,305
they have to want to work
with me. It's like,

929
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,974
do I want to go this way,
or do I want to go that way?

930
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,809
I don't have that many options.

931
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,978
My name was
definitely thrown up today.

932
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,189
PROBST:
Adam, do you agree with Parvati

933
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,690
that she might have
a bigger target?

934
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,484
ADAM:
Yeah, I mean,
when you have played the game

935
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,194
a lot of times or there's

936
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,780
a statue of you built somewhere
on this island,

937
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,074
uh, then, you know, it...
(chuckles)

938
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,367
It's like
people will look at you,

939
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,702
and that can either be

940
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,497
-an opportunity or threat.
-Wow.

941
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,957
Rob.

942
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,500
I understand what he's saying,

943
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,378
but at the same time,
by him saying that,

944
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,171
he's playing the game.

945
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:40,174
But nobody needs
to remind anyone. I-- Like,

946
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,342
-I-I don't think...
-That's what you're doing.

947
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,177
-You're reminding everyone.
-No, no. No, but-but I'm...

948
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,013
But it's not like people
don't already know it.

949
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,682
And so maybe
even by saying it, like,

950
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,350
it just states the obvious,

951
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,810
-and then you can move on.
-ROB (chuckles):
You're helping me.

952
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:51,519
-Thank you.
-No, I... Look,

953
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,063
he has a statue built of him.

954
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,524
I'm not saying you have
to vote him out because of that,

955
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,358
but it's the truth.

Ben,

957
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,196
it's a tricky road to walk

958
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:04,573
because you're
really putting a lot

959
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,367
in the hands of other people.

960
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,828
This alliance thing
is very new for me.

961
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,496
Like, I don't know
how else to put it,

962
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,040
but it's like a circle,

963
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,583
and everybody's
in their own little bunker.

964
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,376
Right? And people are jumping up

965
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,087
out of their bunker and talking.

966
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,797
But everybody's still pointed
at each other.

967
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,340
You know, I'm happy

968
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,384
with what bunker
I have jumped in.

969
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,680
I'm not in mine,
but I'm happy where I'm at.
