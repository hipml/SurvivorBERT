1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:02,252
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,253
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,170
WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.

4
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,088
OH, MY GOD!

5
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,716
Jeff: AFTER AN UNEXPECTED

6
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,758
SWITCH, AN EVEN BATTLE BETWEEN

7
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,301
MEN AND WOMEN TURNED INTO A

8
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:10,969
LOPSIDED AFFAIR.

9
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:14,431
IT'S LIKE GREEK GODS VERSUS

10
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,014
PEASANTS.

11
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,099
Jeff: SALANI DREW ALL THE

12
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,934
STRENGTH LEAVING MANONO AS THE

13
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:18,601
CLEAR UNDERDOGS.

14
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,270
I GOT ON A TRIBE WITH PEOPLE

15
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,272
WHO SUCK!

16
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,775
Jeff: SALANI WINS REWARD!

17
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,317
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

18
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
SALANI WINS IMMUNITY!

19
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,363
THE NEW SALANI WERE SEVEN STRONG

20
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,116
AND THEY DOMINATED EVERY

21
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:33,825
CHALLENGE.

22
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,494
SALANI WINS ICE CREAM REWARD!

23
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,288
WE'RE KICKING THEIR ASS.

24
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,791
I MEAN, BOTTOM LINE.

25
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,501
AT MANONO, LOSING WAS TAKING

26
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,961
A TOLL ON THE TRIBE BUT FOR

27
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,963
COLTON IT WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL.

28
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,964
YOU CAN QUIT OR YOU CAN JUMP

29
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,299
IN THAT FIRE, WHICH EVER IS MORE

30
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,800
CONVENIENT FOR YOU.

31
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,301
I'M RUNNING THIS ENTIRE SHOW

32
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,471
RIGHT NOW.

33
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,221
IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT YOU ARE

34
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:55,889
HELEN KELLER.

35
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,349
Jeff: THEN A SUDDEN ILLNESS

36
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,769
PUT A STOP TO COLTON'S PLANS.

37
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,771
BUT EVEN A MEDICAL EVACUATION

38
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,313
COULDN'T STOP COLTON FROM

39
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,064
INFLUENCING THE GAME.

40
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,983
HE'S GOING TO KEEP THE

41
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,818
IMMUNITY IDOL FOR A SOUVENIR.

42
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,320
CALL ME A BAD PERSON BUT ALL I

43
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,323
KEPT THINKING WAS STRATEGY THE

44
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,407
WHOLE TIME.

45
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,325
Jeff: COLTON'S DEPARTURE

46
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,494
SENT BOTH TRIBES TO TRIBAL

47
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,288
COUNCIL WHERE THEY REUNITED AT

48
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,290
AN UNEXPECTED MERGE.

49
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,794
YOU CAN DROP YOUR BUFFS, WE

50
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,503
MERGED.

51
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,129
THE GAME HAS COME FULL CIRCLE

52
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,008
AND WE ARE EVEN.

53
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:35,136
GRAB YOUR TORCHES HEAD BACK TO

54
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,678
CAMP.

55
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,138
SIX MEN AND SIX WOMEN.

56
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:37,847
12 ARE LEFT.

57
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,891
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

58
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,150
FOOD!

59
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:54,322
OH, MY GOD, THERE'S CHEESE!

60
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,199
THIS SEEMS LIKE "SURVIVOR" TO

61
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,326
ME NOW.

62
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,246
IT'S A MERGE, IT'S ME AGAINST 11

63
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:01,913
PEOPLE.

64
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:02,622
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED, THAT'S

65
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,916
WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO

66
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:05,834
BRING IT ON.

67
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:11,214
OH!

68
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,049
WOULD ANYBODY LIKE MY SIP?

69
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:14,843
I DON'T DRINK.

70
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,055
YOU CAN HAVE MINE.

71
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,850
I KNEW THE MERGE WAS COMING.

72
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,395
I'M SURE CHRISTINA... I DON'T

73
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,272
THINK SHE'LL BE IN THE GAME MUCH

74
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:27,856
LONGER.

75
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,565
IT'S CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

76
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,108
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHRISTINA

77
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,235
GOING HOME AND NOT COLTON.

78
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,280
BY COLTON LEAVING, HE SCREWED ME

79
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,866
OVER, ESPECIALLY FACT THAT HE

80
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,243
DIDN'T GIVE ME HIS IMMUNITY IDOL

81
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,411
SO I HAVE TO START ALL OVER

82
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,120
AGAIN.

83
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,539
MAYBE I'LL GO BACK TO MY HOME

84
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,415

00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,542

I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A GENERAL

128
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,499
ONE OF THE 12 PEOPLE THAT MIGHT

129
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:55,003

130
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,171

GAME RIGHT NOW, I THINK SALANI'S

146
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,860
PEOPLE ARE VIEWING THIS AS A

147
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,612
CHANCE TO VOTE EVERYBODY ELSE

00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,864
OUT OF THE OLD MANONO TRIBE

149
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:23,698
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

150
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,199
OH, THIS IS GOING TO HURT MY

151
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:25,867
MOUTH.

152
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,076

00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,086
I WAS HOPING THAT THE GUYS WOULD

161
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,421
BE SOLID AGAINST THE GIRLS BUT

162
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:47,096

CAN I BE PART OF THE TEAM?

165
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,600

00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,773
SIX GUYS; SIX GIRLS.

170
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,982
RIGHT.

171
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,609
BUT WE HAVE A GIRL THAT WILL

172
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,276
DEFECT.

00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,236
ALICIA, SHE'S BEEN COLTON'S

174
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,528

00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,408

00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,703
TARZAN HE IS TRYING TO GET THE

181
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,121
GUYS TO STICK TOGETHER.

182
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,414
HE FEELS THAT IF THE GUYS STICK

183
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,583

00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,126

00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,116
MICHAEL IS THROUGH VERY QUICKLY.

383
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,953
START WORKING ON THE PUZZLE.

384
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,246

TROYZAN AND CHRISTINA FOR THE

390
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:55,631
ORANGE TRIBE.

391
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,298
THIS IS IT.

392
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,800
FEEL FREE TO START WORKING,

393
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,092
TARZAN.

394
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,176
I AM.

395
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,969
Jeff: COMMUNICATION WILL BE

396
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,470
KEY IN WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS

397
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:01,929
PUZZLE.

398
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:02,513
YOU'RE RIGHT.

399
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:07,268
Jeff: PIECES ARE ALL VERY

400
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:07,643
SIMILAR.

401
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,394
BEAUTIFUL!

402
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,353
Jeff: EVERYBODY CAN TASTE

403
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,479
THAT PIZZA.

404
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,022
THEY CAN IMAGINE THE COLD BEER.

405
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,274
TROYZAN AND CHRISTINA WORKING

406
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,024
TOGETHER VERY WELL.

407
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,152
TARZAN AND JONAS NOW STARTING TO

408
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,820
PULL AHEAD FOR THE BLUE TRIBE.

409
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,822
CHRISTINA AND TROYZAN, WHATEVER

410
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,991
MOMENTUM THEY HAD IS

411
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,366
EVAPORATING.

412
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,284
THERE IT IS.

413
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,702
Jeff: TARZAN WITH A PIECE

414
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,369
NOW.

415
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,162
I GOT A FEW PIECES, COME ON.

416
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,497
TARZAN, QUIT TALKING, DUDE.

417
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,373
Jeff: WE ARE VERY CLOSE

418
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,040
RIGHT NOW.

419
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:30,916
EITHER TRIBE COULD WIN THIS

420
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,625
CHALLENGE.

421
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,502
IT'S COMING DOWN THE LAST COUPLE

422
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,171
OF PIECES!

423
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,339
BOTH TRIBES DOWN THREE PIECES.

424
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:37,840
PIZZA, BEER ON THE LINE.

425
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,384
WHO WANTS IT?

426
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:45,848
THE ORANGE TRIBE WINS REWARD!

427
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,016
(SCREAMING)

428
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:51,187
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

429
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,604
OKAY.

430
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,522
OH, MY GOD!

431
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,192
(SCREAMING)

432
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,069
THIS IS MY ISLAND!

433
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,697
Jeff: NICE AFTERNOON

434
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,573
AWAITING YOU.

435
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,949
PIZZA, COLD BEER AS WELL AS THIS

436
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:04,992
NOTE WHICH YOU WILL READ AFTER

437
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:09,705
YOU FINISHED EATING.

438
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,040
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT.

439
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,877
ENJOY THE AFTERNOON.

440
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,171
TARZAN, KAT, KIM, MICHAEL,

441
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,923
JONAS, LEIF, GOT FOR FOR YOU.

442
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,841
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

443
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,926
CAMP.

444
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,061
OH, MY GOD!

445
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,938
OH, MY LORD!

446
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,857
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PIZZA

447
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,399
SINCE DAY ONE.

448
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,568
YOU GUYS, EVERYONE DID A

449
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,236
FANTASTIC EFFORT.

450
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,279
TO ENDURANCE.

451
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,864
THE CHALLENGE WE HAD TO DO TODAY

452
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,573
WAS A DOOZY.

453
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,867
IT WAS A NAIL-BITER BUT AT THE

454
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,702
VERY END WE WON.

455
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,411
THIS PIZZA COULD HAVE BEEN ICE

456
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,539
COLD AND I WOULD HAVE TORE IT

457
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:51,956
UP.

458
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,624
I DON'T CARE.

459
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,042
I KNOW GOOD PIZZA, I'VE BEEN

460
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,502
LIVING IN NEW YORK FOR TEN

461
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,211
YEARS.

462
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,629
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS DRY-ASS

463
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,089
RICE WE'RE EATING OUT HERE AND A

464
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,757
CHICKEN WE CATCH EVERY BLUE

465
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,051
MOON, IT'S GREAT SO PIZZA WAS

466
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:04,718
PRICELESS.

467
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,387
THEY COULD HAVE BROUGHT OUT

468
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,556
FRIED SKUNK.

469
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,056
(LAUGHTER)

470
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:09,765
(BELCHES)

471
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,058
OH, MY GOSH!

472
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,143
ROCK 'N ROLL!

473
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,436
ALL RIGHT, GUYS WE HAVE THIS.

474
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,689
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

475
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,607
IT SAYS "OPEN WHEN YOU'RE

476
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,775
FINISHED EATING BEFORE YOU GET

477
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:20,109
BACK TO CAMP."

478
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,780
ALL RIGHT.

479
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,447
"IMMUNITY IS THE ONLY WAY TO

480
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,157
GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY IN THIS

481
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:27,783
GAME.

482
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,785
AS PART OF YOUR REWARD FOR

483
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,663
WINNING TODAY'S CHALLENGE, ONLY

484
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,956
YOU SIX WILL KNOW THAT THERE IS

485
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,084
YET ANOTHER IDOL HIDDEN BACK AT

486
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:37,710
CAMP."

487
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,587
THE LESS PEOPLE THAT KNOW

488
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,129
ABOUT THE IDOL THE MORE LIKELY

489
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,089
ONE OF US CAN FIND IT.

490
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,466
SO IF I WERE UP TO ME I WOULDN'T

491
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,217
GO BACK TO CAMP AND BE LIKE

492
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,469
"HEY, THE LETTER SAID THERE WAS

493
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,638
AN IDOL SOMEWHERE."

494
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,265
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS THAT THE

495
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,433
IDOL IS STILL OUT THERE.

496
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,977
MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS FOR

497
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,104
SOMEONE ON THE MANONO TRIBE TO

498
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,315
FIND THE IDOL GOING INTO THE

499
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,484
NEXT VOTE.

500
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,653
AND MESSING UP OUR NUMBERS.

501
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,447
BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE A SALANI

502
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:13,829
GO HOME.

503
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,456
I WANTED THAT PIZZA AND BEER

504
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,206
SO BAD.

505
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,002
I GOT SAND EVERY PART OF MY

506
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:20,669
BODY.

507
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,838
YOU TRYING TO TELL US YOU'RE

508
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,465
GOING TO BE POOPING SAND FOR THE

509
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,841
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?

510
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,676
WE NEED TO GET STUFF TOGETHER

511
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,302
HERE, YOU KNOW?

512
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,679
LIKE SUPPLIES?

513
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,514
OR, LIKE, THOUGHTS?

514
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,516
NO, JUST WHATEVER OUR PLAN

515
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,643
IS, YOU KNOW?

516
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,311
I THOUGHT TARZAN ALREADY

517
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,521
ESTABLISHED THAT.

518
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,522
WHAT WAS THAT?

519
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,358
THAT THE GUYS STICK TOGETHER

520
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,734
AND ALICIA IS THE SWING VOTE.

521
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,777
THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD THAT YOU

522
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,028
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT PLAN

523
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,362
IS.

524
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,029
YEAH.

525
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,738
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING BUT

526
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,073
HE SHOULD PROBABLY FILL YOU IN

527
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:49,698
WITH THE PLAN.

528
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:54,870
WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO

529
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,206
TALK.

530
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,040
I'LL ASK ABOUT THAT LATER ON.

531
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,751
APPARENTLY, THE BRIGHT TARZAN

532
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,419
GOES AND HAS A SECRET MEETING

533
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,296
WITH MIKE AND TELLS HIM THIS

534
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,344
PLAN WHICH I'M NOT EVEN AWARE

535
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,721
OF.

536
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,056
THE GUY MAKES ZERO SENSE.

537
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,933
HE'S A LOSE CANNON AND DOES

538
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,061
WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTS WE

539
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,730
CAN'T HAVE THAT.

540
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,439
YOU TELL THE LEAST RELIABLE GUY

541
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,108
THE PLAN, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE

542
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:24,733
TOW-TO-YOU?

543
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,443
YEAH, BECAUSE WE NEED SIX

544
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,152
GUYS.

545
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,112
YOU TELL HIM RIGHT BEFORE THE

546
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,738
VOTE, NOT TWO DAYS BEFORE!

547
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,365
IF HE'S PLAYING BOTH SIDES, WHAT

548
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,700
IS HE GOING TO DO?

549
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,451
HE'S GOING TO TELL THE WOMEN AND

550
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,536
THEN WE'RE (BLEEP)ED.

551
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,120
THIS IS MY POINT.

552
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,081
WE NEED TO CONSULT AS AN

553
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,457
ALLIANCE BEFORE WE START

554
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:40,874
BLABBING.

555
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,583
I THOUGHT...

556
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,334
WHEN DID IT CHANGE AND WHY AM

557
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,503
I THE LAST GUY TO KNOW?

558
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,296
TWO DAYS AGO I TOLD YOU THAT

559
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,964
PLAN.

560
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:47,256
TWO DAYS AGO I TOLD YOU THAT

561
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:47,923
PLAN!

562
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,467
LISTEN TO ME, I'M NOT DONE

563
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,093
SPEAKING.

564
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,303
YOU ARE SUCH A CONFUSED

565
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,221
(BLEEP), I'M DONE TALKING WITH

566
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:54,680
YOU.

567
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,556
I'M DONE TALKING.

568
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,932
YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF

569
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:57,558
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

570
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,767
DON'T (BLEEP)ING INTERRUPT

571
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,393

572
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,310
LISTEN TO ME FOR A SECOND!

573
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,730
STOP (BLEEP)ING INTERRUPTING ME.

574
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,398
I'M TIRED OF YOUR (BLEEP)ING

575
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,107

576
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,774
AND YOU TELLING ME... I'M NOT

577
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:10,112
EVEN IN THE (BLEEP)ING LOOP.

578
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,407
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT?

579
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,950
THERE'S SO MUCH CONFUSION I'M

580
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,617
GOING TO DROP OUT OF THE TRIBE

581
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,453
AND YOU GUYS CONTINUE WITHOUT

582
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,120
ME.

583
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,830
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

584
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,415
I'M DROPPING MY ALLEGIANCE WITH

585
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,249
YOU GUYS BECAUSE EVERY TIME I

586
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,168
TRY TO TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU

587
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,794
CONTRADICT MED, YOU DON'T

588
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,837
REMEMBER WHAT I SAY.

589
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,839
I'M DONE WITH IT.

590
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:33,135
WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING ABOUT.

591
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,595
MISUNDERSTANDING.

592
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,637
JONAS, LET'S ADMIT IT.

593
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,555
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

594
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,848
DON'T TALK TO ME ANYMORE.

595
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,474
I'M OUT OF IT.

596
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,266
ALL RIGHT.

597
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:43,854
GOOD LUCK.

598
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,773
I'LL FALL ON THE SWORD.

599
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,149
I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO DO IT.

600
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,985
I CAN ONLY PLAY THIS GAME SO

601
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:55,365
LONG BEFORE IT'S IRRITATING.

602
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,200
I DO NOT LIKE JONAS.

603
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,660
I DO NOT LIKE THAT GUY ANYMORE.

604
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,996
WHEN I SAY SOMETHING I MEAN IT

605
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,456
FROM MY HEART AND I DON'T GO

606
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,374
BACK ON IT.

607
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,502
CAN'T LOOK AT THAT FACE ANYMORE.

608
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,022
EVERYONE ALWAYS SLEEPS IN AND

609
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,816
I GET UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING

610
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,234
SO I'M GOING TO FIND THE IDOL.

611
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,193
THESE KNUCKLE HEADS AREN'T GOING

612
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:41,286
TO BE AWAKE FOR ANOTHER HOUR.

613
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:59,680
TO BE AWAKE FOR ANOTHER HOUR.

614
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,265
YES!

615
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,226
THAT'S IT!

616
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:12,192
(LAUGHS)

617
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,986
EARLY BIRD GETS THE IDOL AND

618
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:18,407
GETS THE POWER.

619
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,617
I HAD MY EYE ON THE TWO BIG

620
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,535
TREES CLOSE TO THE BEACH AND I

621
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,411

622
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,412
TO FIND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

623
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,206
IDOL, THAT'S LIKE WINNING THE

624
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,915
GOLD MEDAL.

625
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,876
GOD, I WANT TO, LIKES, WEAR IT.

626
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,127
TROYZAN IS SAFE!

627
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,879
THIS COULD BE A MILLION DOLLARS.

628
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,632
THIS IS CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT IT.

629
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:40,470
THIS COULD TAKE ME FREAKING FAR.

630
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:49,938
COME ON IN, GUYS!

631
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,315
SO IS THERE A NEW TRIBE NAME?

632
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,482
TIKIANO.

633
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,901
Jeff: WHAT'S IT MEAN?

634
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,278
WELL, TIKIANO MEANS GOD AND

635
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,363
ANO MEANS YEAR SO IT'S LIKE YEAR

636
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,114

637
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,782
Jeff: READY TO GET TO

638
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,742
TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

639
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,284
FIRST THINGS FIRST, CHRISTINA,

640
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:09,750
I'LL TAKE IT BACK.

641
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,338
TRIBAL IMMUNITY IS NO MORE.

642
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,505
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS NOW WHAT

643
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,550
YOU SEE.

644
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,135
WITH THIS AROUND YOUR NECK AT

645
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,803
TRIBAL COUNCIL, YOU CAN'T BE

646
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,971

ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

648
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,767

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

652
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,149
WOODEN DISK.

653
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,817
AT REGULAR INTERVALS WE WILL ADD

654
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,778
MORE BALLS MAKING IT MORE

655
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,487
DIFFICULT.

656
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,488
IF AT ANY POINT A BALL DROPS OR

657
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,658
YOU FALL OFF THE PERCH YOU'RE

658
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,325

00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,166
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL, SOMEBODY

662
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,460

663
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,462
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

664
00:20:55,545 --> 00:21:02,970

673
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,667
AND THAT CAUSES SOME PROBLEMS

674
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,044
FOR A FEW PEOPLE.

675
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,755
MAKE SURE THE DISK DOES NOT HIT

676
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,214
YOUR BODY.

677
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:44,302

GREAT JOB.

792
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,814
JONAS, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT

793
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,024
PULL IT OUT WITH YOUR CHEF

794
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:49,524
SKILLS.

00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,026
GREAT JOB, BRO.

THANKS, BUDDY.

797
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:53,987
YOU DID GOOD.

00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,531
HAVE TO TALK LATER.

800
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,366
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

801
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,576
GOING TO BE DOING SOME

802
00:26:59,659 --> 00:26:59,868
SCRAMBLING ACTION.

803
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,535
YEAH.

804
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:04,331
THIS IS LIKE "SURVIVOR" TO

805
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,081
THE ULTIMATE.

806
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,334
I MEAN, I WON AN IMMUNITY TODAY,

807
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,044
I HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

808
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,879
I'VE GOT A GROUP THAT I FEEL

809
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,380
SOLID, MY OLD SALANI WHO

810
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,048
BASICALLY HAVE BEEN PRETTY

811
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,968
STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH ME AND SO

812
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,512
WHATEVER THEY DECIDE TO DO

813
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,181
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

814
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,224
I THINK IT'S PRETTY PLAIN AND

815
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,726
SIMPLE THAT WE STICK TO SALANI

816
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,060
OR 7-5.

817
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,602
YEAH.

818
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,897
JUST PICK OFF THEIR FIVE

819
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,274
STRONGEST TO WEAKEST AND THEN

820
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,192
WE'RE BACK AT SALANI.

821
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,943
SO, LOOK, WE NEED TO FIGURE

822
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:39,908
OUT WHO WE WANT OFF I SAY JONAS

823
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,617
AALICIA.

824
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,951
WE CAN ASK AROUND, TO, BUT MAKE

825
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,578
JONAS THE FIRST CHOICE.

826
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,287
OKAY.

827
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,914
IT'S GUYS VERSUS GIRLS BUT THE

828
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,582
WAY I SEE IT IS WE KEEP IT

829
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,210
SALANI VERSUS MANONO WE SHOULD

830
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,586
TAKE OUT MANONO'S STRONGEST

831
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,253
PEOPLE FIRST.

832
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,547
I DON'T THINK THAT... WOULD

833
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,257
YOU GUYS BE COOL VOTING JONAS

834
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:56,841

835
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,300
LET'S GO JONAS FIRST.

836
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,928
JONAS IS FIRST.

837
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,554
I THINK JONAS IS THEIR

838
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,222
STRONGEST PLAYER RIGHT NOW.

839
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,766
WHICH I HATE BECAUSE HE'S A

840
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,434
GREAT COOK.

841
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,936
GREAT POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

842
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,187
FUN TO BE AROUND.

843
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,979
BUT JONAS I'M THINKING IS GOING

844
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:15,110
TO BE THE NEXT TO GO.

845
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:15,902
HEY, YOU.

846
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:16,486
HEY, YOU.

847
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,571
NO ONE HAS COME UP TO ME.

848
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,783
COME UP TO ME, GIRLFRIEND.

849
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,284

00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,619

NICE AND HE COOKS GOOD SOUP."

853
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,125
I DON'T CARE WHETHER HE MAKES

854
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,626
A GREAT SOUP.

855
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,128
FOR TONIGHT'S VOTE WE WANT TO

856
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:33,962

857
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,963
BIGGEST THREAT AND KEEP

858
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,382

HONESTLY I WAS THINKING JONAS

872
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:56,317
CAPABLE.

I KNOW.

874
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,945
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

875
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,071
TALKING ABOUT JONAS BECAUSE THEY

876
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:00,822
THINK THEY FEEL HE'S A BIG

877
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,324
THREAT AND HE'S THE SMARTEST OF

878
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:03,992

THEY MENTIONED MY NAME.

888
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,506
YEAH, THEY DID.

889
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,049
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO VOTE

890
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:20,508
ME?

891
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,176
I HAVE NO IDEA.

892
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,803
WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR NAME HAS

893
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,514
COME UP, YOU IMMEDIATELY THINK

894
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,308
OH, CRAP, I'M GOING HOME.

895
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,476

FEELING THAT I'M OUT OF THE

897
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:30,727
LOOP.

898
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,979
IT MAKES NO LOGICAL SENSE TO ME

899
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:37,692
STRATEGICALLY TO VOTE ME OUT

900
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,985
I'M, LIKE, THE LEAST THREATENING

901
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:39,986
GUY HERE.

902
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,029
THERE'S MIKE WHO'S THE MOST

DOMINANT PERSON AS FAR AS

00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,698
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES SO THEY WANT

00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,034
TO KEEP HIM AROUND OVER ME AND

906
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,037

THAT'S ALL WE GOT.

944
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,803
SO WE'RE VOTING FOR KAT KIND

945
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,180
OF AS A LAST-MINUTE SCRAMBLE.

946
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,225
I'D RATHER VOTE MIKE OUT INSTEAD

947
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,060
BUT WE FIGURED, YOU KNOW, KAT,

948
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,396
SHE DOESN'T PULL HER WEIGHT ALL

949
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,606
A WHOLE LOT, SHE KIND OF ANNOYS

950
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,274
A LOT OF PEOPLE SO THAT'S MY

951
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,570
ONLY HOPE AT THIS POINT IS I'M

952
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:07,907
VOTING KAT.

953
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,908
DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOTHING THAT

954
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:09,576
NEEDS TO BE BOILED.

955
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,452
JUST MY UNDIES.

956
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,161
EXCELLENT.

957
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,997
THIS IS NOT POOP, OKAY, IT'S

958
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,289
DIRT.

959
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,832
OKAY.

960
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,207
OKAY.

961
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,667
ALL RIGHT.

962
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,835
BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT LOOKS

963
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,127
TO ME HOW IT COULD BE POOP,

964
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:19,460
RIGHT?

965
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,086
I KNOW.

966
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,171
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK IN THAT

967
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:22,755
DIRECTION.

968
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,215
I SWEAR TO GOD IT IS NOT

969
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:24,799
POOP.

970
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,466
IT'S CHOCOLATE, OKAY?

971
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,759
IT'S DIRT.

972
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,802
IT'S DIRT, I SWEAR.

973
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:31,306
SO WHY IS THERE DIRT

974
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,432
CONCENTRATED IN ONE AREA?

975
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,642
BECAUSE IT'S NEAR MY BUTT.

976
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,019
I SWEAR, IF IT'S IN BOILING

977
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,437
WATER YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

978
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,146
EVEN IF IT WAS POOP PANTS.

979
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:45,486
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

980
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,196
WE TALKED ABOUT WHO WE

981
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,323
THOUGHT SHOULD GO HOME NEXT.

982
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,157
I WANTED TO GET A GOOD BATCH OF

983
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,159
LAUNDRY DONE, GET MY STUFF

984
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:51,868
CLEAN.

985
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,202
SO I PUT IN THE THE SALT WATER,

986
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,329
SCRUBBED IT REALLY GOOD WITH

987
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:54,996
SAND.

988
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,167
I WAS GOING TO HAVE SOME CLEAN

989
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,546
CLOTHES.

990
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,174
IT'S NOT POOP, IT'S DIRT, I

991
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:06,716
SWEAR.

992
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,176
YEAH, BUT I'VE ALREADY

993
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,385
CLEANED MY OWN IN THE OCEAN.

994
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,220
YOU NEED TO CLEAN THEM THE

995
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:11,846
OCEAN.

996
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:12,221
THESE HAVE BEEN CLEANED IN

997
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,848
THE OCEAN.

998
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,099
DON'T DO THAT.

999
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,476
LET ME CLEAN THEM IN THE

1000
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:16,893
OCEAN FIRST.

1001
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,686
I KNOW ALL ABOUT

1002
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,270
MICROBIOLOGY.

1003
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,480
LET ME GET MY STUFF OUT

1004
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,022
FIRST.

1005
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:21,856
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY

1006
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,565
DIFFERENCE.

1007
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,276
I HAVE BEEN WORKING ABOUT IT.

1008
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,027
EVEN SO THE MICROBES ARE DEAD

1009
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,029
WHEN IT BOILS.

1010
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,156
IT'S NOT THAT CONTAGIOUS.

1011
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,409
I'M GOING TO GO PUKE, I'LL BE

1012
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,035
RIGHT BACK.

1013
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,913
YOU DON'T WANT TO TEND THE

1014
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:50,677
FIRE?

1015
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,428
IF IT WERE UP TO ME TARZAN

1016
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,138
WOULD GO HOME BECAUSE I'M ALL

1017
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,683
ABOUT WHO DESERVES TO BE HERE.

1018
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,726
WHO HAS A POSITIVE ATTITUDE?

1019
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,310
WHO BRINGS EVERYONE UP WHEN

1020
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,019
EVERYONE'S DOWN?

1021
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,730
WHO'S JUST A GOOD PERSON TO BE

1022
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,523
AROUND?

1023
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,192
TARZAN DOESN'T FILL ANY OF THOSE

1024
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,236
EMPTY LINES.

1025
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,904
JONAS WORKS HAS ASS OFF AND

1026
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:10,863
FEEDS ALL OF US.

1027
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:15,952
CAN WE SPARE HIM A COUPLE MORE

1028
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:16,577
DAYS?

1029
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,328
AND TAKE TARZAN'S ASS OUT.

1030
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,329
AT LEAST WE HAVE SOMEONE AROUND

1031
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,248
THAT'S FEEDING US.

1032
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,958
TARZAN JUST PISSES EVERYONE OFF,

1033
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:22,583
YOU KNOW?

1034
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,459
I UNDERSTAND YOUR THOUGHT.

1035
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,293
YOUR THOUGHT WAS TAKE OUT DEAD

1036
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,002
WEIGHT.

1037
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:29,716
I COMPLETELY HATE TO SEE DEAD

1038
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,300
WEIGHT ALICIA, CHRISTINA,

1039
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,343
TARZAN, LEIF, I HATE THEM

1040
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,095
SITTING AROUND CAMP.

1041
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:34,887
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT.

1042
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,933
IF YOU SET A PLAN IN PLACE AND

1043
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,476
IT GETS BROKEN ALL HELL CAN

1044
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,394
BREAK LOOSE AND COME BACK TO

1045
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:51,446
BITE YOU IN THE BUTT.

1046
00:33:51,529 --> 00:34:06,794
BITE YOU IN THE BUTT.

1047
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,172
Jeff: SABRINA, WHAT'S THE

1048
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,089
SINGLE-BIGGEST DIFFERENCE NOW

1049
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,299
THAT YOU'RE MERGED AND IT IS

1050
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,134
EVERY INDIVIDUAL FOR THEMSELVES?

1051
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,927
IT'S VERY CHAOTIC.

1052
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,471
EVERYONE'S TRYING TO PREDICT

1053
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,180
WHERE THEY WILL STAND, WHO'S

1054
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,974
WITH WHO AND JUST LIKE, OKAY, IT

1055
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:24,812
CAN'T BE PEACEFUL RIGHT NOW NOT

1056
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,313
ONE SOMEONE'S HEAD IS ON THE

1057
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,190
CHOPPING BLOCK.

1058
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,274
Jeff: JONAS, IS IT

1059
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,150
INEVITABLE TO BE THINKING "WHO

1060
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,444
DO I WANT TO SIT NEXT TO AT THE

1061
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,988
END AND HOW DO I MAKE SURE I'M

1062
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:34,697
THERE?"

1063
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,491
IT IS CRITICAL BUT YOU CAN BE

1064
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,492
THINKING WAY TOO FAR AHEAD.

1065
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,326
I HAD PEOPLE TODAY SAY "HEY,

1066
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,162
YOU'RE A THREAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A

1067
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,163
PROVIDER AND YOU COOK."

1068
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,498
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T VOTE THAT

1069
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,832
GUY OUT FIRST!

1070
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,834
NOT ONLY THAT, YOU WANT TO GO TO

1071
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,171
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES AGAINST THIS

1072
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:50,755
GUY?

1073
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,549
THAT'S NOT GOOD STRATEGY.

1074
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,009
MIKE VERSUS ME?

1075
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,010
AS YOU CAN TELL TODAY I

1076
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,845
DIDN'T REALLY PERFORM THAT WELL.

1077
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,806
YOU CAN BE GREAT AT PUZZLES, I

1078
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,431
MIGHT SUCK.

1079
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,350
I'M NOT DONE, BRO, I'M NOT

1080
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,351
DONE SPEAKING.

1081
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,478
I'M PROPOSING TO THOSE PEOPLE

1082
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,483
THAT KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

1083
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,359
I'M VOTING FOR MIKE TONIGHT.

1084
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:15,363
WELL, MIKE, HOT SEAT BROTHER.

1085
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,241
I DISRESPECT WHAT JONAS JUST

1086
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,867
DID.

1087
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,493
I DISRESPECT IT DEEPLY.

1088
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,160
GIVING UP HIS PRINCIPLES,

1089
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:21,869
THROWING MIKE UNDER THE BUS.

1090
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,537
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO FIGHT FOR HIS

1091
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,206
LIFE AND THAT'S THE END OF THAT.

1092
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,374
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING

1093
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,333
ELSE.

1094
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,419
Jeff: SO, JONAS, TARZAN IS

1095
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,254
SAYING "RELAX, BROTHER, YOU'RE

1096
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,172
NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT."

1097
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,715
I'M NOT SAYING THAT NOW

1098
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,050
BECAUSE HE MAY HAVE THROWN

1099
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:36,676
HIMSELF OVER THE BUS.

1100
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,011
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

1101
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,263
DESPITE YOUR BRILLIANT PLAN WE

1102
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,683
DO NOT HAVE THE VOTES TO VOTE

1103
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:48,688
OFF KAT.

1104
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,356
WHAT'S I DO?

1105
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:50,731
TARZAN, YOU CAN TELL ME.

1106
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,274
IT'S OKAY.

1107
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,235
HE'S LYING, KAT, OKAY?

1108
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,361
IT'S GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AS

1109
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,529
YOU GO ON, JONAS.

1110
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,030
YOU DID PROPOSE THAT.

1111
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:58,573
YOU WANT TO ATTACK ALL OF US

1112
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,407
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

1113
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,201
I'M JUST STATING THE FACT.

1114
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,244
JEFF, I THINK WE OUGHT TO

1115
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,496
VOTE JONAS OUT.

1116
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,039
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT IT, WE MIGHT

1117
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,416
AS WELL VOTE HIM OUT.

1118
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:12,795
I'M SICK OF THIS.

1119
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,421
Jeff: WHY THE BIG REACTION?

1120
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,339
WHAT ARE WE NOT GETTING?

1121
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,258
JONAS HAS BEEN ON MY BACK

1122
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:17,925
FROM DAY ONE.

1123
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,218
HE'S ALWAYS UNDERMINING ME.

1124
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,428
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

1125
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,721
I'M GOING TO GO UP THERE AND PUT

1126
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,055
HIS NAME DOWN.

1127
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,223
I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I'M GOING

1128
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:24,932
TO DO.

1129
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,183
I'M SICK OF IT, I HOPE YOU GO

1130
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:26,934
HOME TONIGHT.

1131
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,935
I'M SICK OF FIGHTING WITH YOU.

1132
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,103
THAT'S FINE.

1133
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:29,687
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I'M

1134
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,355
TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME.

1135
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,941
YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR THAT.

1136
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,734
JEFF?

1137
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,401
Jeff: CHELSEA?

1138
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,778
ON JONAS' DEFENSE, I THINK

1139
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,490
MORE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ISSUES AND

1140
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,742
ARGUMENTS WITH TARZAN THAN THEY

1141
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,076
HAVE WITH JONAS.

1142
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,453
Jeff: SABRINA YOU'RE

1143
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,287
NODDING YOUR HEAD IN AGREEMENT.

1144
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,413
I'VE HAD A COUPLE RUN-INS

1145
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,749
WITH TARZAN LIKE EVERYONE ELSE

1146
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,333
I'M SURE HAS BUT I HAVE HAD ZERO

1147
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:54,003
ISSUES WITH JONAS.

1148
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,254
Jeff: BUT...

1149
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,798
THE THING IS, JEFF, IF YOU'RE

1150
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,466
COMPARING LIKABILITY I ADMIT I'M

1151
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,384
NOT AS LIKABLE AS JONAS.

1152
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,803
I'M AWKWARD OUTSIDE MY

1153
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,304
ENVIRONMENT.

1154
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,055
Jeff: WHAT IS YOUR

1155
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,598
ENVIRONMENT?

1156
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,807
MY ENVIRONMENT IS A HOSPITAL

1157
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,975
AND OPERATING ROOM AND I DO

1158
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,144
GREAT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT.

1159
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,520
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN OF

1160
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,480
THE SHIP IN AN OPERATING ROOM OR

1161
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,649
SOMEBODY DIES.

1162
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,983
Jeff: SO THIS IS A VERY

1163
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,859
DIFFERENT WORLD FOR YOU BECAUSE

1164
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,443
THERE IS NO CAPTAIN OF THIS

1165
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,152
SHIP.

1166
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:21,864
YOU KNOW, I HAVE IDEAS THAT I

1167
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,324
THINK HELP PEOPLE AND WHEN THEY

1168
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,367
DON'T SEE IT, IT IRRITATES ME.

1169
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,204
Jeff: SO, KIM, IT'S VERY

1170
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:28,496
INTERESTING WHAT DEVELOPED HERE

1171
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,163
TONIGHT.

1172
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,998
YOU HAVE JONAS WHO EVERYBODY

1173
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,167
SAYS IS LIKABLE AND PROVIDES.

1174
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:33,876
HE STIRS THE POT AND OUT COMES

1175
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,461
THE GUY ON THE END WHO SAYS "I'M

1176
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,630
THE OLD GUY, I DON'T REALLY LIKE

1177
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,215
THIS SOCIAL PART OF THIS

1178
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:39,840
GAME...".

1179
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,633
I DIDN'T SAY I DIDN'T LIKE

1180
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,217
THE SOCIAL.

1181
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,635
I SAID I'M AWKWARD IN IT.

1182
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,011
Jeff: CASE IN POINT.

1183
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,471
EVEN I CAN'T GET IT RIGHT.

1184
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,515
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF A MERGE,

1185
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,183
I THINK.

1186
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,018
YOU KNOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE

1187
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,478
LIKE JONAS BECOME A THREAT AND

1188
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,313
PEOPLE LIKE TARZAN BECOME AN

1189
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:54,897
ASSET.

1190
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:55,189
Jeff: DEPEND HOW YOU LOOK

1191
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:55,898
AT IT.

1192
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,025
SURE.

1193
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:58,526
Jeff: CHELSEA, WHERE DO YOU

1194
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,194
WEIGH IN ON THIS?

1195
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:01,487
I JUST THINK THERE'S PEOPLE

1196
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,822
YOU WANT TO KEEP AROUND BECAUSE

1197
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,365
THEY'RE POSITIVE, THEY'RE

1198
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,075
PROVIDERS, THEY HELP OUT SO MUCH

1199
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,703
AND THEN THERE'S DEAD WEIGHT.

1200
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,538
DID YOU MEAN ME?

1201
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,874
MAYBE.

1202
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,043
Jeff: SO, TARZAN, AS THIS

1203
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,838
TRIBAL HAS EVOLVED ARE YOU

1204
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,214
CONCERNED IT COULD BE YOU

1205
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:20,923
TONIGHT?

1206
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,092
I CAME HERE WONDERING WHETHER

1207
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,927
ALLEGIANCES WOULD BE MAINTAINED

1208
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,887
AND I SENSE WE'VE FALLEN APART.

1209
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,225
SO THAT MAKES THE WHOLE THING

1210
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,727
TOTALLY MERCURIAL AT THIS POINT

1211
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,228
NOT KNOWING WHICH WAY OR HOW

1212
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,146
IT'S GOING GO.

1213
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,941
I MEAN, IF THEY WANT TO VOTE ME

1214
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,234
OFF THAT'S FINE.

1215
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:40,860
I'M VOTING FOR JONAS TONIGHT

1216
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,947
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID.

1217
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:45,656
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S FIND

1218
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,533
OUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO SHAKE

1219
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,242
OUT.

1220
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,869
YOU CAN NOT VOTE FOR TROYZAN.

1221
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:50,578
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1222
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,454
IT IS.

1223
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,248
TIME TO VOTE.

1224
00:38:54,331 --> 00:39:03,424
ALICIA, YOU'RE UP.

1225
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:45,966
ALICIA, YOU'RE UP.

1226
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:55,976
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1227
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,937
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1228
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,146
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1229
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,150
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1230
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,693
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE

1231
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,986
DECISION IS FINAL, THE PERSON

1232
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,363
VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE

1233
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,989
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1234
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:09,532
IMMEDIATELY.

1235
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:13,536
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1236
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,707
FIRST VOTE, JONAS.

1237
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,166
MICHAEL.

1238
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,296
TWO VOTES MIKE.

1239
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,005
JONAS.

1240
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:30,010
TWO VOTES MIKE; TWO VOTES JONAS.

1241
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,514
THREE VOTES JONAS.

1242
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:37,685
FOUR VOTES JONAS, TWO VOTES

1243
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,435
MIKE.

1244
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,563
JONAS, THAT'S FIVE VOTES JONAS,

1245
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,357
TWO VOTES MIKE.

1246
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,154
SIX VOTES JONAS.

1247
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,822
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE

1248
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,866
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY, JONAS,

1249
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,367
THAT'S SEVEN, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1250
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,580
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1251
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:01,542
TARZAN, NO HARD FEELINGS

1252
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,084
BROTHER.

1253
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:02,376
HARD FEELINGS TO YOU.

1254
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,670
OKAY.

1255
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:08,716
Jeff: JONAS, THE TRIBE HAS

1256
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,258
SPOKEN.

1257
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,219
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1258
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,013
HEY, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT FOOD

1259
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:14,305
SITUATION.

1260
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,558
(LAUGHS)

1261
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,768
Jeff: WELL, YOU JUST VOTED

1262
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,897
OUT SOMEBODY WHO ALMOST

1263
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,356
EVERYBODY AGREES WAS LIKABLE,

1264
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,609
WAS A PROVIDER AND WAS LOYAL.

1265
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:30,696
AND THAT MEANS NOBODY IS SAFE.

1266
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,032
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1267
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,116
CAMP, GOOD NIGHT.

"SURVIVOR."

1275
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,424
SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT WHO'S

1276
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:51,592
NEXT TO GO?

1277
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,053
JAY AND TROYZAN HAVE THE

1278
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:54,720
JITTERS.

1279
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,262
HE'S A BIG THREAT AND NEEDS

1280
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,139
TO BE TAKEN OUT A.S.A.P.

1281
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:57,848
THERE'S TOO MANY GIRLS THAT

1282
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,934
COULD START KNOCKING OUT THESE

1283
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,267
GUYS.

1284
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:00,851
GUYS.

1285
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:01,477
Jeff: WITH GOOD REASON.

1286
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,103
WE HAVE TO DECIDE IF WE'RE

1287
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,563
GOING TO, LIKE, MAKE OUR MOVE

1288
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:04,939
BECAUSE THIS IS NEVER GOING TO

1289
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:05,731
BE THE SAME.

1290
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,815
I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS IS ABOUT

1291
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,861
TO GO DOWN.

1292
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,906
SO I CAME HERE TO GO BIG OR

1293
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,116
GO HOME AND I WENT BIG AND NOW

1294
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,742
I'M GOING HOME.

1295
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,453
(LAUGHS)

1296
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:21,997
BUT YOU KNOW I GAVE IT ALL I GOT

1297
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,916
AND THE FACT THAT I GOT VOTED

1298
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:27,002
OUT IT KIND OF SUCKS BUT AT

1299
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:27,836
LEAST... AT LEAST THEY SAID I

1300
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,921
WAS A GOOD FISHERMAN AND A GOOD
COOK
