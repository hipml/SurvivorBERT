1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Previously on Survivor.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,400
There are three idols in play, held by Adam, David and Jay.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,560
It stays between me and you.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,320
After the merge, Chris, Brett and Sunday saw Jessica as the biggest threat.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm reading about Jess.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,560
But the majority had already made their decision.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,440
It's the safest bet to split the votes between Taylor and Jay.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,200
This is the last meal.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Cheers.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,160
With little hope left, Taylor revealed Adam's secret.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,040
Adam has an advantage in this game.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,040
But the tribe couldn't forgive him for stealing food.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
You ate it?

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
Yeah, me and Jay ate it today because we thought you guys would vote us out.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Today?

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Yep.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
Sending him to the jury.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Taylor, the tribe has spoken.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,360
Elevener left.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:01:06,760
Who will be voted out tonight?

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,480
Yeah that was some tribal, huh?

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
That was insane.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,400
If I can just say, I am very sorry to all of you for not telling you.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,160
It was not possible because Taylor knew about the advantage that I didn't want to reveal

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,680
to the group yet.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
And I am sorry.

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,880
You know, Taylor stole food from us.

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,440
That's why he is gone.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's look at the bigger picture here.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,800
Oh man, Taylor and Jay dragged my name through the mud.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,880
And now everybody knows about my advantage.

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,400
I want Jay out of this game so badly, I can taste his blood in my mouth.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,360
Is there any food left from the feast hidden somewhere?

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I do know where it is.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
It was a vault.

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
You said he moved it.

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Oh well, I don't know where it is.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,360
He said he moved it because he didn't want you to have any food.

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Right, of course.

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,480
Dude, so I'm in tribal council just thinking, Taylor, stop talking dude.

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
You're burying me with you.

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,760
Like, not only are you going out, but now you're making sure that I go out next.

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,560
How am I going to clean this up?

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,600
Here it is.

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,960
So I unburied the food just as like a good faith.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,640
Like hey, here's the food, this is what's left and I'm going to be honest about it.

47
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Oh you found it?

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
A little bit.

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Yeah.

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm literally up against the wall, literally.

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,920
But considering the fact that I haven't used my idol this whole time, it's perfect because

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
now they really think I don't have one.

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,520
It's just a good reason we can't leave Taylor.

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Who cares?

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I don't care.

56
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Yeah, he's still a crazy idiot.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,480
I mean, did anybody not know he was a complete moron?

58
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,920
Taylor leaving was my goal, Taylor left.

59
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,480
Next move, let's go.

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,600
Jay is seemingly on the bottom, but he's not right now in my opinion.

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,360
That's about to get real.

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
You understand that, don't you?

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Oh yeah.

64
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
I don't know what to do.

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Well, I know what to do.

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
We have to get rid of Jess.

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
You know what I mean?

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Yeah.

69
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
It's got to be Jess.

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,040
90% of it is she's a strategic player, 10% of it is I owe her one.

71
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,960
For the blindsiding Pauly and my alliance, and if I don't hit her first, she's going

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
to hit me.

73
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,280
And we got to have six solid, me, you, Sunday, keep Zeke close to her.

74
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,720
We need to keep him.

75
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Zeke's good.

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,480
We definitely do this, but we get a tip toe, not for big time.

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,480
This is a small tactical squad that's got to go in and take out Jess, and if it's the

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:38,240
last thing I do, I will vote her out.

79
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,480
Sunset was nice, but the sunrise.

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
Beautiful.

81
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,680
It's hard to have a bad day after that, you know?

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,320
And Survivor, you got to find a way to connect to someone who's drastically different from

83
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
you.

84
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
And I do flirt with Ken.

85
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,960
I just, you look at Ken and you're like, Ken, Ken wouldn't have any sort of crush on me.

86
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,440
Cause like, look at him.

87
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,280
Just, you know, the first few seconds of the day you can look at the sun.

88
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Ken, you told me that.

89
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Yeah, and it doesn't hurt your eyes.

90
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
But maybe, just maybe.

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,600
Yeah, Ken and I, yeah.

92
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,760
No, it's, yeah, I could, I could see that.

93
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,640
How are you feeling this morning?

94
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,880
I didn't even know where the vote was supposed to end up.

95
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,560
I figured it was Taylor, but I didn't know for sure.

96
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,280
Obviously you have more information than me at this point because I wasn't a part of that

97
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
big alliance.

98
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Yeah.

99
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,440
So like David, Chris and I brought together the big votes that we've been seeing.

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Right?

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Cause we each have like our people.

102
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,640
Yep.

103
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
But now you know.

104
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Now the game beats up.

105
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Yeah.

106
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,160
I'm done working with Jay.

107
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,960
It's time to jump off the second ship onto a life raft.

108
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,200
And that life raft's name is Zeke.

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,440
Now that you are letting me in on all this, there is something I have to tell you.

110
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,000
Jay does have an idol.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
We found it together on Ikebukuro.

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,400
But if anybody else finds out and that gets back to Jay, then I'm screwed.

113
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,040
So that's me giving up information.

114
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
That's good.

115
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Yeah.

116
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,120
I want to give up information to just really solidify this right now that you and Hannah

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,640
are my alliance right now.

118
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Good.

119
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Dude, we're a hundred percent.

120
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Okay.

121
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Thank you for telling me.

122
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Yes.

123
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,400
Telling Zeke that Jay is the idol is a way to build trust between Zeke and I.

124
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,600
Just don't tell anybody about the idol.

125
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I won't.

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Yeah, I know you won't.

127
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,160
But you know, I don't want to tell too many people, but telling one individual who I need

128
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600
to build trust with definitely doesn't hurt my game.

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,320
If anything, it only helps my game.

130
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,280
Will told me Jay does have an idol.

131
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Does have an idol.

132
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
That's good to know.

133
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Jay does have an idol.

134
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,720
But did you hear what Will told Zeke?

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
No.

136
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
What?

137
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Jay has an idol.

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
We know Jay has an idol.

139
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,280
I can confirm Jay has an idol.

140
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,000
Jay does have an idol.

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,240
Will told Zeke that Jay has an idol.

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
So Jay has an idol.

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
This coming from Will?

145
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Yeah.

146
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,040
He's turning up to be kind of handy.

147
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,960
I need to have the most power in the game and everything in Survivor is about relationships.

148
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,320
There's no better way to build trust with an ally than revealing the location of a hidden

149
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
immunity idol.

150
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,200
And on top of that, a person with a hidden immunity idol has a major advantage in this

151
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,320
game.

152
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,360
But if everybody knows that they have it, that advantage decreases significantly.

153
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,520
I think we have like a misinformation campaign.

154
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
And make Jay feels like he's the next target.

155
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Yeah.

156
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
We can do that.

157
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Blush it.

158
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,600
I'd like to knock Jess out.

159
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
That's fine.

160
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
I think we do knock Jess out.

161
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,760
But we just got to keep the blind side between six or seven people and leave it be.

162
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,080
Look, I mean, Hannah and Will got them unlocked.

163
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Okay.

164
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
You got your people.

165
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Right.

166
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Cool.

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Keep our eye on the prize.

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
What's doing?

169
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
All right, buddy.

170
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,980
We wanted to get Jay to think he's the next one to go.

171
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,080
So he plays the hidden immunity idol.

172
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,760
But in actuality, Chris wants to vote out Jess.

173
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,800
You know, we've had these two nice votes with a lot of people voting together.

174
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,160
But now the time has come to turn on each other.

175
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,280
The opening shots have been fired and the war is about to get bloody.

176
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:27,640
Come on in, guys.

177
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:43,160
All right, you guys ready for today's reward challenge?

178
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Yeah.

179
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,880
For today's challenge, you're going to be divided into two teams of five.

180
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,680
On my go, you'll swim out to a raft and work together to pull yourself to a platform.

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,640
You'll climb up a ladder, retrieve a key, slide down a pole, and erase it to shore.

182
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,200
Once you have all your keys, you will unlock a set of blocks and then stack them so that

183
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,200
there are no repeating colors on any side.

184
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,680
First team to finish wins a reward.

185
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
Want to know what you're playing for?

186
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Yeah.

187
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,000
It is a floating pizza restaurant that will be anchored 50 yards outside your camp where

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,840
you can enjoy pizza, chicken wings, cold beer.

189
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,920
While the losers sit at camp so close they can almost smell it.

190
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,040
So far, they'll never taste it.

191
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,000
That's messed up, Jeff, but I love it.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
A survivor brother.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, it is.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We're going to draw randomly for teams, which means one person will not be on a team.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,040
I think everybody would feel that I'm such a crappy swimmer.

196
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,000
Nobody wants me on their team, right?

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
David, don't do that.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Are you sure?

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I mean, I just...

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Are you already bailing out of this challenge?

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,960
It's just that I don't have a lot of confidence in my swimming ability, and I don't want people

202
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,960
to blame me for them missing out on pizza and beer.

203
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
That's all.

204
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
You can do it, dude.

205
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
You got it.

206
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
You never give up.

207
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Yeah, I won't do that.

208
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,920
David, what does it feel like to feel that support?

209
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,320
Because I don't think ever in 33 seasons of Survivor anybody has said, I'll sit out because

210
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,080
I don't want to bring you guys down, and then have the rest of the group say, no, you can

211
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
do it, man.

212
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Don't give up.

213
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,760
No, it feels really good.

214
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:42,200
These guys have really been helping me deal with my anxiety and fear, and I'll never...

215
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
You're a good man.

216
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
You're a good dude.

217
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
It's all right, dude.

218
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
You're a good guy.

219
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,080
I'll never forget the support that they've given me, like game or no game, I'll never

220
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
forget it.

221
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,600
That said, I do not want to be my ability.

222
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Choose a rock, Dave.

223
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Choose a rock.

224
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Choose a rock, brother.

225
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Yeah, choose a rock.

226
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Everybody's picking rocks.

227
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
All right, let's do it.

228
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Oh, my God.

229
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:12,120
All right, we have our two teams.

230
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,360
It is Ken, Jessica, Chris, David, and Will taking on Brett, Zeke, Sunday, Hannah, and

231
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Adam.

232
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,680
J picked the odd rock.

233
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Will not compete.

234
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Here we go.

235
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Four rewards.

236
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Survivors, ready?

237
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Go!

238
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
You got to get to that raft and then pull yourself in.

239
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Everybody's got to be on the raft.

240
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Go, go, go.

241
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,800
Orange is released.

242
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
They're starting to pull.

243
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
It takes a lot of teamwork to move that raft.

244
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Apples and crabs.

245
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Ken, Jessica, Chris, Will, and David with a slight lead.

246
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,280
Got to get everybody to that platform before you can start working on the keys.

247
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Now you've got to untie five keys.

248
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Go, Orange!

249
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Purple now slowing down.

250
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Got to get everybody on that platform.

251
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Ken up first for Orange.

252
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Ken's got a key.

253
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
He dropped it.

254
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
He's got to go back and get it.

255
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Come get it.

256
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Come get it.

257
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Purple now at their platform.

258
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Hannah's going to go up first.

259
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Don't drop it.

260
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Don't drop it.

261
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Ken's got his key.

262
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Take your time.

263
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
You got it.

264
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Go ahead, Hannah.

265
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Nice.

266
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Good job, Hannah.

267
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Hannah has her key.

268
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Ken lost a lot of time.

269
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Go.

270
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Good work, Hannah.

271
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Go.

272
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
It's Jessica now.

273
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Here comes Hannah.

274
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
You've got to get all the way up this beach, Hannah.

275
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Put it on the ring.

276
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Go.

277
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Go, Sunday.

278
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
It is now Sunday going up for Purple.

279
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Jessica now has a key.

280
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Whiply down that pole.

281
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Come on, Sunday.

282
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Sunday, go.

283
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Go, Sunday.

284
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Go, Sunday.

285
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Go, Sunday.

286
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Go, Sunday.

287
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Go, Sunday.

288
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Go, Sunday.

289
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Go, Sunday.

290
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Go, Sunday.

291
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Sunday has a key.

292
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
That's it, Sunday.

293
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Let's go, Sunday.

294
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
A big fall by Sunday.

295
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
That's the way you're doing it.

296
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Go, Sunday.

297
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Go.

298
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
It is now Chris heading up the ladder for Orange.

299
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Come on, Sunday.

300
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Sunday's struggling in the water.

301
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Come on, Chris.

302
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Chris has this third key.

303
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Sunday's taking a long time with that second key.

304
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Go.

305
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Adam is now going up for Purple.

306
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Chris is sprinting through the sand.

307
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
A huge effort by Chris.

308
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Go.

309
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Go, Sunday.

310
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Go, Sunday.

311
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Go, Sunday.

312
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Go, Sunday.

313
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Go, Sunday.

314
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Go, Sunday.

315
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Go, Sunday.

316
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Go, Sunday.

317
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Go, Sunday.

318
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Go, Sunday.

319
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Go.

320
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
It is now Will heading up.

321
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Good job, Will.

322
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
That's it.

323
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
That's it.

324
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Adam has a key now.

325
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Orange with a one-person lead right now.

326
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
That's it.

327
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Come on, Adam.

328
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Adam's fighting through the water.

329
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Now he's got to track down that key.

330
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
He's got it.

331
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Will has the key for Orange.

332
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Adam back with the third key.

333
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Go.

334
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
It is now Zeke heading up for Purple.

335
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Will back with the fourth key.

336
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Go.

337
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
David, the last one to go for his team.

338
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
You got this.

339
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Go on, David.

340
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
Go on, David.

341
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Go on, David.

342
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Go on, David.

343
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Go on, David.

344
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Go on, David.

345
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Go on, David.

346
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Go on, David.

347
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Go on, David.

348
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Zeke working on untying the key.

349
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
David untying the key.

350
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Zeke heading down the pole.

351
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
David down the pole.

352
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
No problem.

353
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Hit those legs up.

354
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Let's go, Zeke.

355
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
David fighting through the water.

356
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
He has the last key for his team.

357
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Excellent.

358
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
I'll do the first key.

359
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I'll do the first key.

360
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Go.

361
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:18,000
It is now Brett up for Purple looking for that fifth and final key.

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They're looking to unlock four locks right now.

363
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, Brett.

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Come on, Brett.

365
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Come on, Brett.

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,560
Ken working on that first lock and he's got it.

367
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,280
Chris now working on the second one.

368
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Go.

369
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Go.

370
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,760
He's now Zeke going for that first lock for Purple.

371
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Orange already has one.

372
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
You got it, Chris.

373
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
You got it.

374
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
You got it.

375
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Chris has the second lock for Orange.

376
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
That one.

377
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Zeke has the first one for Purple.

378
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
And he quickly has the third lock.

379
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Go, David.

380
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Go.

381
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
There comes David.

382
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Go.

383
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,240
He's still working on that second lock.

384
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
What's the last one?

385
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
David has the fourth lock released.

386
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
That was quick.

387
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Adam finally has it.

388
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:00,680
Orange can now take those blocks up and start stacking them.

389
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Sunday now working on that third lock for Purple.

390
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,400
It is David and Chris stacking those blocks.

391
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,760
You don't want any repeating colors on any side.

392
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
You got two yellows on this side.

393
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Yes.

394
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Nice.

395
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Sunday has the third lock for Purple.

396
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
How are you doing?

397
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
You got it.

398
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
You got it.

399
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
You got it.

400
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Brett has the fourth lock.

401
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Go.

402
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
You're good.

403
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Go, guys.

404
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
You guys have good?

405
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Good.

406
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Two reds.

407
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
No good over here.

408
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Turn this one around.

409
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,920
It is Zeke and Adam trying to make up a lot of time on the puzzle.

410
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,880
David and Chris have had a lot of time to study it and work on it.

411
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,680
If there are any repeating colors, it's not right.

412
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,440
Come on, guys.

413
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Come on.

414
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,560
Chris, trying to figure out what is missing.

415
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
It's easy to get three.

416
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
It's getting that fourth one.

417
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Takes the work.

418
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,080
Go to my side.

419
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Is there a pattern?

420
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
And this side needs red.

421
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Or is it just process of elimination?

422
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,680
Zeke and Adam think they have something.

423
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,960
Yes, this looks good.

424
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Are they right?

425
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Yes.

426
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
You think you got it.

427
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
This is good.

428
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
That side's good.

429
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Reward.

430
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Adam.

431
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:18,800
Zeke, Hannah, Sunday, and Brett in a huge come from behind.

432
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Sorry, man.

433
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
I'm sorry.

434
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
No, no, no, no.

435
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I'm sorry, guys.

436
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,440
Zeke, Brett, Adam, Sunday, Hannah, nice afternoon.

437
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,200
Pizzeria brought to you.

438
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,240
You'll enjoy the works while these guys dream about it.

439
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

440
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Thanks, Chef.

441
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
You're welcome.

442
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,240
This is cool.

443
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Where is the food?

444
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Oh my God.

445
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Nice fish.

446
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Look at those wings.

447
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Give me the lettuce.

448
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
I want the lettuce.

449
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
This reward was my first reward.

450
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
I couldn't help it.

451
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
My body just reacted with elation.

452
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,240
I just collapsed into myself in happiness.

453
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,240
We've got to be quiet.

454
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
They're literally right there.

455
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,240
I also felt pretty guilty because I could see people back at camp, people who you know

456
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
are hungry, and I've been on that side of it.

457
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Hey, here's a chicken wing.

458
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Guys, it's crazy.

459
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
The sound travels, like they literally can hear it.

460
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Okay, Hannah, I'm eating.

461
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
I don't care right now.

462
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
It's just crazy.

463
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,240
You know, I don't care what everyone else thought back at camp.

464
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Rewards are huge for your game because it makes you feel human again.

465
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,240
It was like I was sitting at a bar having a few beers and some pizza with some friends.

466
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Can you give me a beer?

467
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Absolutely.

468
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I want a beer for Brett.

469
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
You like this beer, Zeke?

470
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Yeah, it's a good beer.

471
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
I'm not too much of a casey.

472
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
It's a little lighter than the other one, but I think I kind of like the other one better.

473
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,240
And it was good because Zeke and I really bond, and I think that's really going to be a big

474
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,240
help down the road because he's been a lot closer with Chris and I needed that bond.

475
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Zeke, cheers.

476
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Cheers, brother.

477
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
So, Brett, is this everything you dreamed of?

478
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
This is very nice right now.

479
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Yes.

480
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
This does not suck.

481
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Fula, everyone.

482
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
This is for you guys.

483
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Oh, my God.

484
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Oh, my God.

485
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Oh, boy.

486
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Oh, my gosh.

487
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Got some lettuce from home.

488
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Hey, a pass.

489
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Thanks.

490
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Nice.

491
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
No, no way.

492
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Thank you so much.

493
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Thanks.

494
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
All right, everyone.

495
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Take it easy.

496
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Take it easy.

497
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Oh, my God.

498
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
Let it take a moment.

499
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:47,240
To get a letter from home, I don't know that anyone will ever know what that meant.

500
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,840
I'm so glad we won this one.

501
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:59,320
The other four saw that it meant a lot to me, but they don't know that my mom was diagnosed

502
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
with cancer.

503
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:12,280
And one of the hardest parts out here is the fear that at any point it's not going to be

504
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,520
good news for me.

505
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:22,820
So every day that I know my mom's doing okay and every day that I stay here, that I make

506
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,120
it further in the game, that I get closer to that loved one's visit and closer to the

507
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,520
end is another big win.

508
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,920
My dad sent a message from his dog, Memphis.

509
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Wait, let me see.

510
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,800
It's nice to hear from family, isn't it?

511
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Yeah.

512
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,320
Just that little piece.

513
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,040
It's enough to keep me going, to get me through these last two weeks of the game.

514
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Is everyone ready?

515
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,320
Three, two, one.

516
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Yeah!

517
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:08,160
It is cold blooded of Jeff to put that right out there in front of us.

518
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
But so goes the game.

519
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,120
So how are you holding up, man?

520
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,760
Pizza and beer is exactly what I was craving, have been craving for days.

521
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,760
But you know what?

522
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:29,880
We'll have our own dinner here.

523
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,720
Mentally and emotionally, how are you holding up?

524
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,760
I don't want to cry again, so I don't want to talk about it really.

525
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,160
I really appreciate your support and everyone's support.

526
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,240
You guys have really been awesome.

527
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,840
Dude, what you've done and what you've accomplished, the ways that you've evolved, changed, grown

528
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,800
since you've been out here, everybody respects.

529
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,080
I'm on a journey and it's about coming out of this game as a better person than the person

530
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,320
I walked in as.

531
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,200
My whole life I've had this gigantic fear of death, but over the years it became something

532
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,660
far worse.

533
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,080
It morphed into a fear of life and that's why I'm here.

534
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm here to start taking control of my life and I really believe that if any experience

535
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,840
can give me that power, it's this game of Survivor.

536
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,480
Even though I really wanted to win that challenge more than anything, it's nice to reconnect

537
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
with you.

538
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,720
We're always going to be good in this game, you and I, okay?

539
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,240
I'm still all about final three with you, okay?

540
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,560
I want to sit next to you there.

541
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
I trust you, that's why.

542
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
You know you can, man.

543
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,100
Ken and I had some alone time and he really gives me a sense of confidence within myself

544
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,760
and I'm realizing just in life and in this game, you have to take control of your own

545
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
destiny and you know what?

546
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,560
Timing is everything in Survivor, but the threesome of Chris, Brett and Sunday is too

547
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
strong.

548
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm uncomfortable with how deep in this game they've made it.

549
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,760
It's time for me, Jessica and Ken to make a big move right now.

550
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,160
The thing is, Chris, Brett and Sunday, they're a threesome.

551
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Yeah.

552
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
We just gotta break that up.

553
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,920
Yeah, we gotta cut off on the heads.

554
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,720
So three of us vote out Chris.

555
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Chris?

556
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Yeah.

557
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Oh yeah, I gotcha.

558
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,480
And I think Hannah and Zeke will vote against Chris.

559
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
And Adam.

560
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Yeah, and Adam, that's six.

561
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,560
You're 100% sure on Zeke.

562
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,360
He's pointing Chris aside to go on walks.

563
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Look, here's the deal.

564
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
Okay, I'm just asking.

565
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,000
No, no, no, I'm just telling you what's happening, or what I see happening.

566
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,720
Honestly, if I had to pick anybody in this game that is playing it the best, it's Zeke.

567
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,640
But with this particular vote, I believe that maybe I'm wrong, but I really do believe it's

568
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,400
in his best interest to get rid of Chris as well.

569
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Okay?

570
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Mm-hmm.

571
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,640
David wants to vote out Chris, which would be incredible because I feel like he's my

572
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,320
arch nemesis out here.

573
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,200
We had some issues on our initial tribe together.

574
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,960
So as far as I'm concerned, Chris needs to go home.

575
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,800
Come on in, guys.

576
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:37,840
All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?

577
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Yeah.

578
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Yeah.

579
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
First things first, Ken.

580
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,400
Come back.

581
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,040
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.

582
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,200
For today's challenge, you're gonna stand on a narrow beam while balancing a statue

583
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,480
with a long pole.

584
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,000
At regular intervals, you're gonna move farther away from the statue, making it more difficult

585
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
to balance.

586
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,040
At any point, you fall off the beam where your statue drops, you're out.

587
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,800
The first person left, Sam, wins immunity.

588
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Safe from the vote, losers go to tribal council where somebody will be the 10th person voted

589
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,920
out and the third member of our jury.

590
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
We'll drop your spots.

591
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
We'll get started.

592
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Let's do this.

593
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
All right.

594
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
All right.

595
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:37,880
Everybody has their statue balanced at the end of the pole, and this challenge is on.

596
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,320
You can push it off or it can fall backward.

597
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Either one, you're out.

598
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,920
What about ants crawling on your stomach?

599
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,760
You have ants right now or just daily?

600
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:54,480
I meant literal ants crawling on me right now.

601
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:08,120
We'll go five minutes in this section and we will move a little farther away from that

602
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
statue.

603
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
All right.

604
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Everybody has transitioned to the second stage of this challenge.

605
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,480
Now the balance beam is a little more narrow.

606
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,680
You're a little farther away from the statue.

607
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,840
It's a little more difficult.

608
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,760
We'll go five minutes again in this section.

609
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,960
Sunday's pole and she's closer and closer to the top of her statue, but she's still

610
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,400
in it.

611
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,100
Hannah Drops is the first person out of this challenge.

612
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,600
No shot at immunity.

613
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,480
Have a spot on the bench.

614
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,600
And Ken is the second person out of this challenge.

615
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:58,080
We're down to nine.

616
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
All right.

617
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,200
Everybody has now moved back to the third section of this challenge.

618
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,800
The beam just got even narrower and now you're even farther away from the statue and holding

619
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,000
onto more pole.

620
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,280
Ken's ants have moved on to me.

621
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,240
Adam with ants and movement.

622
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,520
Not a good combo.

623
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:29,760
Nine people still left in this challenge and no sooner do I say that, we are down to eight.

624
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,440
Chris, right behind her.

625
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Will drops.

626
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Will is out of the challenge.

627
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,720
Jay, the slightest bit of a slip and Jay is out followed right behind him by Brett back

628
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
to back.

629
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,040
Do you have something in your eye?

630
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, an ant crawled in there.

631
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,320
Ants proving to be a big nuisance at this challenge.

632
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,440
We are down to four.

633
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:10,320
Jessica, the only woman left in this challenge along with Adam, Zeke and David.

634
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,640
We are now in the last phase of this challenge.

635
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,120
Most of your feet are at the farthest end of the beam and the most narrow.

636
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,560
You're fully extended on a 10 foot bamboo pole.

637
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,540
We go now until we have a winner.

638
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,240
No more time limits.

639
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,720
Zeke quickly in trouble.

640
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Statue moving.

641
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,160
This pole has dropped now to the very bottom.

642
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,600
Here comes the wind and the wind knocks Adam out.

643
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,320
Adam is out and we are down to three.

644
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,640
It is Jessica, Zeke and David.

645
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,320
Zeke trying desperately to keep that statue balanced.

646
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,560
A lot of movement.

647
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,080
Out of nowhere, Jessica drops and we are down to two.

648
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,720
She looked so solid.

649
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,240
Just how difficult this challenge is and how much toll 28 days can take on you.

650
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,040
It is now Zeke and David.

651
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,160
David has proclaimed himself the underdog.

652
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,120
Who would have predicted this final two?

653
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,200
Zeke, very close to dropping again and saves it again.

654
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,720
David, looking very solid.

655
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,040
Don't lose your concentration.

656
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,400
Keep doing what you're doing.

657
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,680
Let's stay here all day.

658
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:49,600
Zeke, back and forth, teetering dangerously close to dropping.

659
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,080
Here comes the wind again.

660
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,720
No.

661
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:12,920
Big gust blowing David's buff nearly off his head but he's still in it.

662
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Zeke drops.

663
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,920
David wins individual immunity.

664
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Nice job.

665
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Nice work.

666
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Nice job, David.

667
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,880
Huge battle between Zeke and David.

668
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,880
All right, David.

669
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,520
Great job.

670
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:38,200
David, come on over.

671
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Individual immunity.

672
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,660
I got to ask, you came into this game and you have been so vulnerable about the things

673
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,780
you see as flaws, your inability to swim, you're not as athletic and yet here you stand

674
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,400
with the most valuable thing around your neck that you earned.

675
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,200
You're going to make me cry again, Jeff.

676
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,520
Well, what is it?

677
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,780
There are so many people that watch this game and think I could never do that.

678
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,960
You were one of them.

679
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,760
Yeah, and I'm just trying to like tamper down that voice in my head that says I can't and

680
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,920
start listening to a voice that says I can't.

681
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,640
David, safe tonight.

682
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,400
We'll live to see day 29, make it to the final 10.

683
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,640
As for the rest of you, somebody will be voted out and become the third member of our jury.

684
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,860
It will not be you.

685
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,160
Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you tonight at tribal.

686
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Congrats.

687
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Thanks, Jeff.

688
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,960
This immunity necklace can only be the beginning.

689
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,720
It can't be the end.

690
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,560
And it's a risk to put your foot down.

691
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:47,240
If I have anything to say about it, Chris is going to go home.

692
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,160
Hello, David.

693
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Congrats.

694
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,320
Thanks a lot.

695
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,720
I appreciate it.

696
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,920
Thank you for all the support.

697
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Nice job, buddy.

698
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Thanks, man.

699
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
I appreciate it.

700
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,960
So the immunity challenge was today and I freaking blew it.

701
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Damn it.

702
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Good job, brother.

703
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Thanks.

704
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Amazing job.

705
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Now I got to go to tribal without immunity and it freaks me out because I have no idea

706
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
what's going on.

707
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
What's the word?

708
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
I don't know.

709
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Yeah, you do.

710
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Kids hold multiple words.

711
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:32,400
Well, I know I'm one of them.

712
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
No one wants to talk to me.

713
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,600
All I know is if I feel it in my gut to use this idol, I'm going to pull it out and just

714
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,440
throw it out there.

715
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,840
Something in my gut says if we don't get Jess out, we're going to get played.

716
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,320
What we're talking about is we still move on Jess, but we got to play it up to Jay.

717
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,720
You better play your idol.

718
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,280
Chris and Brad are ready to vote out Jessica.

719
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,960
And that's exactly what I wanted to do the last vote because I'm worried literally every

720
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,680
day that she's putting something together to get me out of the game.

721
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,360
Nobody should tell him to play an idol because I know we're trying to flush it.

722
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
No, we are.

723
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
I know.

724
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Yeah.

725
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,080
Tonight's the night that we finally make a move on Jess.

726
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,360
My man Zeke and his group are on board and in a perfect world, Jay would play his hidden

727
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
immunity out tonight.

728
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,560
It would be flushed and Jess would go home.

729
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,000
It's written stone going after Jess.

730
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,320
That's it.

731
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,120
How you feeling about tonight?

732
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,840
Well, I'll just make my pitch to you and maybe it lines up with yours.

733
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
And if it doesn't, let me know what yours is and I'll it'll probably be better than

734
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
mine.

735
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Sure.

736
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,120
I feel like we just got to go after Chris.

737
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,960
Chris wants to go after Jess and David wants to go after Chris.

738
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,120
So this is what I am deeming the Gen X Civil War.

739
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,360
And I think I feel secure because Will will vote.

740
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,160
This is going to be real easy, I think.

741
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Yeah.

742
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,120
I'm tight with Chris, but if this war is starting, I want to have the power and the control.

743
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,040
So now it's time to pit the Gen Xers against each other.

744
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,720
And you know Chris is coming after Jess.

745
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,640
Chris is targeting Jess.

746
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,740
He's been targeting Jess since the beginning of the game.

747
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,880
So Jessica is not safe as long as Chris is in this game.

748
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,840
You are next according to Chris, okay?

749
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,760
The plan, his plan is to vote you out next and get Jay to play as item.

750
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,280
So I'm wondering what's going on between Zeke and Chris.

751
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,480
Nothing.

752
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,640
I have been told point blank that my name is getting written down by Chris and that's

753
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,880
a scary feeling because I feel like he's got it out for me.

754
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,340
Like he has been gunning for me since the decision to vote Paul out.

755
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,720
If I get voted out, I have to give the legacy advantage to someone else.

756
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,760
But that's not happening because I'm a fighter and I'll do whatever I have to do to survive.

757
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,680
Chris is going to be voting for me.

758
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Okay.

759
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Not Jay.

760
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Okay.

761
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,640
Obviously you, me, Ken, Dave are 100%.

762
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,360
I do think that Zeke is with us.

763
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
I think so too.

764
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
But it's not 100%.

765
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
And we don't.

766
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,800
I wish it wasn't coming to this already.

767
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
I know.

768
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
Why can't we just vote out Jay?

769
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,000
We will but we got to take care of the Chris problem first.

770
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Right.

771
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,480
The best thing for me is to have Chris go home.

772
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,440
But we need to have Zeke.

773
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,600
Tonight I have to trust an enormous amount of people.

774
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:33,560
Like what do you think?

775
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,320
You know, both sides think they're pulling off a blind side.

776
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Yeah.

777
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,720
And they don't want to feel like they can trust the one who's, you know.

778
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
I know.

779
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,920
It's a game of trust, you know?

780
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Yeah.

781
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,040
Right now I have what I've always wanted to have, which are options, right?

782
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,000
Two sides think they're pulling off a blind side.

783
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Right.

784
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That's crazy.

785
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,200
And then we're trying to flush and idle.

786
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,480
My little clique of nerdy millennials can't work with Chris, my like oaky buddy, or I

787
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,320
can work with David and make this huge move.

788
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,760
But it's hard for me because like I trust both of these guys.

789
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,120
To win this game, you have to know where you're going and you have to know who you need to

790
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
get there.

791
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,640
And so this next vote is all about amassing the soldiers I need to march my army down

792
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:37,040
the field.

793
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,680
Now bring in the members of our jury.

794
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:52,520
Michelle and Taylor voted out at the Last Tribal Council.

795
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,040
So Jay, pick up from Last Tribal.

796
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,840
The food scandal erupted.

797
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,960
Taylor's voted out.

798
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
That leaves you.

799
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Yeah.

800
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,160
Today I kind of felt like this lone wolf just traveling around waiting for like a crack

801
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,680
to happen or someone to approach, but I'm still in the outs right now, Jeff.

802
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,480
David, did you see that going on in relation to Jay because he had to be a central figure

803
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,080
in the conversation one way or the other?

804
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,920
Well that's an interesting question.

805
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,680
There are different voting blocks.

806
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,800
So tonight is about whether the voting blocks decide to unite to eliminate a single threat

807
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,440
or there's a division and multiple targets emerge.

808
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,080
So it's predictability versus blindside tonight.

809
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,400
Zeke, is voting block the right term for what's happening?

810
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,160
I think what we're maybe seeing is some sort of permutation between a voting block and

811
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,520
an alliance, but it's premised upon trust just as an alliance is, it's just smaller.

812
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,440
Hannah, what's your take?

813
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
It is something between an alliance and a voting block.

814
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,400
I call it a trust cluster.

815
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,360
Trust cluster is a great term.

816
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,440
Because voting blocks can be broken up in the blink of an eye and an alliance never

817
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,880
changes but a trust cluster is somewhere in between.

818
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,360
Brett, where do you weigh in on the trust cluster?

819
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Why is that funny?

820
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,000
It's just amazing to hear you say a term I just created.

821
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm sorry.

822
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,920
It's just like the fan in me is like I said trust cluster and now you're asking about

823
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,600
it but I'm very focused.

824
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,440
Hannah, you're fantastic.

825
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,200
I love it.

826
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,760
So Brett, do you think there are multiple trust clusters tonight?

827
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,440
Yeah, Jeff, I do.

828
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,520
And you know, my thing is the trust part of it.

829
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,360
You know, who can I trust going forward in this game and getting rid of people I can't

830
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,240
trust going forward in this game.

831
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,960
Chris, where is the game right now from your point of view?

832
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,040
I think there's a couple of groups but where are you going to fall trust wise within those

833
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
groups?

834
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,520
Every vote, the line gets drawn again but trust should not be an issue tonight.

835
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,080
And yet, Adam, tribal after tribal, when I read the last vote, there's somebody going,

836
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,200
oh my God, another blind side.

837
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,760
I think it's because Jeff, there's sort of a Cold War brewing and the question is can

838
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,440
we focus on a single threat?

839
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,920
And Jay would be one of those people that we're talking about.

840
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,600
Jay, backhanded compliment.

841
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,780
Thank you.

842
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,440
But I know what's happening.

843
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,320
Hi, I'm like the biggest target on the board right now so it's kind of nerve wracking at

844
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
the moment.

845
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,000
Sunday, where do you think this vote is going to go tonight?

846
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,920
I think it's more about who we can't trust than who we can trust in the end of the vote

847
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,320
but the truth is when you have to trust somebody, the only way you can trust them is by looking

848
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,560
at their past actions.

849
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,680
So who here believes they've done something that might be viewed as a past action that

850
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
would get them a vote?

851
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,440
Okay, so we've got Adam and Jay and that's the whole food thing.

852
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,120
Jessica, what's yours?

853
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:00,160
I unfortunately had some run-ins with the Gen Xers way back when.

854
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,640
Chris, she's talking in code.

855
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,680
Do you know what Jessica's referring to?

856
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,280
Yeah, she blindsided Brett and Polly, you know, and me but you have to have a short

857
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,400
memory in this game so Jess has nothing to worry about.

858
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,640
David, how certain are you that tonight's vote will go as you think it's going to go?

859
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,440
I actually feel 100% certain, maybe it's because I'm wearing this necklace but I'm not worried

860
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,840
about tonight's vote.

861
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,680
Zeke, David's 100%, where are you?

862
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
100%.

863
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
This is fantastic.

864
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,400
Sunday, how confident are you?

865
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
100%.

866
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Chris, 100%?

867
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
You bet.

868
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Jay?

869
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm 100% sure I'm ready to go.

870
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,240
I have no idea what the hell is going to go on tonight.

871
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,000
Zeke, if somebody had approached Jay, the last thing Jay's going to do is say, yep,

872
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,320
I'm solid tonight.

873
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,240
Yes, that's very true.

874
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,920
From a group of people who have all participated in blindsides, we're very good at playing

875
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,000
that we can stick to the plan.

876
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,120
So appearances are very deceiving in this game.

877
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,960
All right, it is time to vote.

878
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:27,160
Phil, you're up.

879
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:40,760
You still are holding a grudge, regardless of what you said tonight at tribal.

880
00:39:40,760 --> 00:40:09,440
I'm going to go tally the votes.

881
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,800
Somebody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it?

882
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,960
Now would be the time to do so.

883
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,520
Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final.

884
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,080
Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.

885
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,520
I'll read the votes.

886
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
First vote.

887
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Chris?

888
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,760
Jessica?

889
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,000
Chris?

890
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Jessica we're tied.

891
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,720
Two votes Jessica, two votes Chris.

892
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Chris?

893
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,280
Jessica, we're tied again.

894
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,440
Three votes Jessica, three votes Chris.

895
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,520
Chris, that's four votes Chris.

896
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,560
Jessica, tied again.

897
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,320
Four votes Jessica, four votes Chris.

898
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:17,560
Chris, that's five votes Chris, four votes Jessica.

899
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,200
Tenth person voted out, the third member of our jury.

900
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,160
Chris, that's six, that's enough.

901
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:31,160
Need to bring me your torch.

902
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:37,000
Chris, tribe is spoken.

903
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Boomer.

904
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Sooner.

905
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:56,880
Well, alliances, voting blocks, trust clusters, whatever you call it, this game is being played

906
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,880
at a very high level and that means one thing, more blindsides to come.

907
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:10,040
Grab your torch and head back to camp, good night.

908
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,560
I was completely blindsided today.

909
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,920
It's disappointing, I wanted to go further in the game, but Jess outplayed me man.

910
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,320
I've been going after her for a long time, so I'm just having a hard time processing

911
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
it.

912
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,280
But no regrets, I'm coming home to my boys soon, Jackson Costner and my wife, I love

913
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:48,640
you for letting me have the adventure of a lifetime.

914
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Great move.

915
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,360
Holy crap, I didn't know what the heck was going on.

916
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,520
That was so awesome.

917
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,120
I was sitting there, I'm like, no one's really talking about me, don't use it.

918
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,280
It was a million dollar gamble and I was right and my name didn't even show up once.

919
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Sorry I wrote your name.

920
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,880
You don't need to apologize, you have no reason to apologize at all.

921
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,240
Sending Chris home solidifies things for the group that I trust because we had a plan and

922
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,520
everybody stuck to it and the next vote should be Jay.

923
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,480
He was totally in control, so that move needed to be done whether it was now or in a couple

924
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,360
days and I'm a huge fan of Chris, but he would have won the whole game.

925
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:39,400
Yeah, I think that was just short of the feeling, but I want to say I'm sorry that we couldn't

926
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,120
have done this together and in my mind, you and Sunday are not on the bottom.

927
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,680
I appreciate you hearing that, I knew you and I had a really good before in the last

928
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680
couple days.

929
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,680
Yeah.

930
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,080
Tonight's vote went as I anticipated, it was necessary to see Chris go because Chris was

931
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,760
in a major power position.

932
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,160
He controlled Brett and Sunday.

933
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,680
I would love to move forward if you'll do it.

934
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,680
Alright, I'd love that too, Brett.

935
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Alright, awesome.

936
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,680
Let's talk more in the morning.

937
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Definitely.

938
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
Great.

939
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,200
I saw going forward, I was going to need to make a move against David and his coalition.

940
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,400
If I'm going to come for David soon, I need at least six.

941
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,960
Brett and Sunday are integral to that six and I like most of all that I got to them

942
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
before David did.

943
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:26,960
Look at the calm the water is today.

944
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,960
It's beautiful.

945
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:37,080
I just want to tell you guys just because like, you know, I flipped on Chris yesterday

946
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,080
doesn't mean that I'm like, okay, now you, now you.

947
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,440
No, no, no, no, listen, we had to all think about it at some point.

948
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Yeah.

949
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,440
And Chris is my buddy too.

950
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,440
I know, I know.

951
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
And he could have won this whole thing.

952
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
He's a strong player.

953
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,440
It's out with, out mass and out play.

954
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
Yeah.

955
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,440
So like you said, just do what you can until I tell you that.

956
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
Yeah, that's exactly it.

957
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
I still think Jay should go.

958
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,440
Don't you think?

959
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Is it next time?

960
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Yeah.

961
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,960
I want to make Jay the next vote, but the fact is the person winning this game right

962
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,720
now is Zeke.

963
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,360
And so I think I need to eliminate Zeke in three votes because I do want to get rid of

964
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:19,560
Jay, then Will, then Zeke.

965
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,360
You guys know who's playing the best game right now.

966
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Okay.

967
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:28,360
The guy has an individual conversation with everyone in this game.

968
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,320
He gives up enough information so that people trust him.

969
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,360
He's going to win.

970
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,280
Unbeknownst to David, I've signed on with Zeke because David, I know he can't be trusted.

971
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,000
So I'm nodding and I'm thinking David needs to go and he needs to go fast.

972
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,680
How are you feeling this morning, dude?

973
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
I feel, no, I feel good, man.

974
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,360
What concerns me is that I think David needs to go.

975
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,680
He mentioned to me this morning, Zeke's playing the best game, Zeke's friends with everyone,

976
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Zeke needs to go.

977
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,920
Wouldn't you know, I wake up this morning and David has already started to come for

978
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
me.

979
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,680
I mean, like it's understandable, right?

980
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,520
Because I've already started to come for David.

981
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,320
You want to know something about David?

982
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,320
What?

983
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
He has an idol.

984
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,320
I know he's got an idol.

985
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
Okay.

986
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Do you know why I know he has an idol?

987
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
Because he always has an idol.

988
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,320
Yeah.

989
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
If you're going to snuff him, you got to do it without him knowing and that's going to

990
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,320
be hard.

991
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,240
I'm like the doughy little gay guy and like a lot of people just didn't believe I could

992
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
hack it out here.

993
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,240
And I think it's developed the toughness in me.

994
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
But I'm telling you, watch David.

995
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,800
Yeah, no, I know.

996
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,040
Today I am a warrior because my goal ultimately is to make a move against David.

997
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,000
That's what I call foilant.

998
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:59,800
I will make coconut popcorn for my friend.

999
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Yes.

1000
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,000
The thing about Zeke and I, I think we're chess players in this game of Survivor.

1001
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,560
And I feel like I can read Zeke's mind.

1002
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,240
I feel like we're having much the same thoughts.

1003
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,760
And I hope people see Zeke as playing harder than I am.

1004
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:24,560
So I don't think it'll be such a hard sell when it comes time to vote him out.

1005
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,760
David and I are very similar people.

1006
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,800
But like I understand that I'm threatening.

1007
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,800
David understands that I'm threatening.

1008
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,760
I think people see it.

1009
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:40,360
But I think David is more of a threat to win than I am.

1010
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,320
This is the war that everyone has been alluding to.

1011
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,000
And now it's a scramble for who has the troops.

1012
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,120
I had a good talk with Brett this morning.

1013
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,440
He told me that David approached him this morning and said that I am David's next target.

1014
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,560
So interesting.

1015
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,400
So David has an idol.

1016
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
He found it the morning after he played it.

1017
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Get out of town.

1018
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,040
I think the more dangerous couple right now is Will and Jay.

1019
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,360
I just want to object to this by saying that like neither Will nor Jay is coming after

1020
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
me right now.

1021
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,360
It's true.

1022
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,360
Yeah.

1023
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,720
I want both David and Zeke to feel like I'm in their corner.

1024
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,160
And they're both two extremely threatening players.

1025
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,120
Look, like this is the first time someone's brought your name up.

1026
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,120
Right.

1027
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,880
I mean, I would love to work with David.

1028
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,160
Ben and I are very similar, both very neurotic people.

1029
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,640
But it's been a month of Zeke and me working side by side.

1030
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,440
So I don't know who I choose, either Zeke or David.

1031
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:57,640
Come on in, guys.

1032
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:04,400
All right.

1033
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,440
You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?

1034
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,440
Yes.

1035
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,080
For today's challenge, you'll be divided into three teams of three.

1036
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,360
Your feet will be tied together.

1037
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,680
Your arms will be bound to your sides.

1038
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,240
One at a time, you will slither through the sand through a series of obstacles.

1039
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,880
Then you'll work together to solve a snake puzzle.

1040
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,920
First team to finish wins reward.

1041
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,520
Want to know what you're playing for?

1042
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Yes.

1043
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,640
The winning three will be picked up here in this beautiful sand spit in the middle of

1044
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,640
Fiji by Chopper.

1045
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Oh, my God, Chopper.

1046
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,320
You'll go up in the air and get a nice tour of this beautiful place you've been living

1047
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,440
for the last 29 days.

1048
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,280
You'll then touch down and enjoy a survivor picnic.

1049
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,840
Oh, my word.

1050
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,840
Fried chicken.

1051
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Oh.

1052
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
Mac and cheese.

1053
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,840
Mac and cheese?

1054
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,680
Wine, beer, soft drinks, pie.

1055
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Oh, Lord.

1056
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,480
Great afternoon and a nice chance to strategize away from all the losers.

1057
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,280
There's one twist to this challenge because only nine of you are going to run.

1058
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,560
That means one person will not have a chance to earn their shot at reward, and they won't

1059
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
have to.

1060
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,120
If you draw the white rock, you don't participate.

1061
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,960
You automatically earn a spot.

1062
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Whoa.

1063
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,440
Think of it as a survivor lottery.

1064
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,440
Give me the white one.

1065
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,840
We're going to draw for teams.

1066
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
We'll get started.

1067
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,840
Let's do it.

1068
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,920
All right.

1069
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,120
We have our teams.

1070
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,120
It is Hannah, Jessica, and Adam.

1071
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:43,000
It is Will, Ken, and Jay, and it is Sunday, Zeke, and Brett.

1072
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,440
David chose the white rock.

1073
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,080
This is going to be one of the most physical challenges, and all David has to do is just

1074
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,480
wait for it to end.

1075
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,240
He's going on reward either way.

1076
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,240
Here we go.

1077
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,240
I'm going to draw for reward.

1078
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,240
Survivors ready.

1079
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,240
Go.

1080
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,560
Go, Hannah.

1081
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:05,320
Come on, Sunday, you got it.

1082
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,320
Hannah, Will, and Sunday, like inchworms.

1083
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,920
Will off to the fast start.

1084
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,840
Face down, not afraid to get dirty.

1085
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
Will is working it.

1086
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
Go, Willie.

1087
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
Starting to lose those shorts.

1088
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,840
That American flag about to get left behind.

1089
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,840
Come on, Hannah.

1090
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
You're almost there, Hannah.

1091
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
Hannah, like an elephant seal, trying to beat yourself.

1092
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,840
All right.

1093
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
You got it.

1094
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,840
You got it.

1095
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,720
Hannah like an elephant seal trying to beat herself.

1096
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,720
Kick it!

1097
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,640
And Sunday at last will very close to the relay point.

1098
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,640
Go Ken!

1099
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,640
Come on Ken!

1100
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,920
Now Ken's got to start up and over these sand mounds.

1101
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
Here comes Hannah!

1102
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
Push, push, push, push, push!

1103
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
Go Jessica!

1104
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
It is now Ken in the lead.

1105
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
Come on Ken!

1106
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Warrior!

1107
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
Jessica digging!

1108
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
This is difficult!

1109
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,920
Come on Sunday you're almost there!

1110
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
Go Z!

1111
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:54,240
Come on Zeke you got this man!

1112
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,800
Zeke now going up and over.

1113
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,800
Jessica working.

1114
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,800
You can do it Jessica!

1115
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,800
Ken is moving very fast extending the lead for green.

1116
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
Go Jen!

1117
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,800
Go!

1118
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,800
Now green with a huge lead over purple and orange.

1119
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,800
Zeke now starting to get a rhythm going.

1120
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,800
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice!

1121
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,800
You're almost there Jess!

1122
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
Jessica struggling.

1123
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,800
I can't get it!

1124
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Almost there.

1125
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,800
I can't get it!

1126
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:21,320
Jay is flying through the course.

1127
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:27,840
Once Jay gets to the end, all of green can release.

1128
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
Go green!

1129
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
Starting in time you can work on the puzzle!

1130
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,840
Zeke is almost here!

1131
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,840
Face down covered in sand!

1132
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,840
You got it buddy!

1133
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,840
Zeke looks like a survivor mind.

1134
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:41,040
Go Brett!

1135
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,440
Orange trying to get in it now.

1136
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,320
Jessica still trying to get up that last mound.

1137
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,320
I can't do it!

1138
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,160
Will, Ken and Jay working on that snake puzzle.

1139
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,040
Good job Brett!

1140
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,520
Brett is really moving.

1141
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,720
He's going to make up a lot of time.

1142
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,760
Let's go Brett you're almost there!

1143
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,160
You got it!

1144
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:14,160
That white butt glowing in the sun!

1145
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,160
Jessica really struggling!

1146
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,160
A massive setback for purple.

1147
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,160
One last effort away!

1148
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,160
Go Adam!

1149
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,160
Push!

1150
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
Adam has not slowed down at all.

1151
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Push!

1152
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
Touch that mat and you are good.

1153
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,160
Go purple!

1154
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,160
Start in time!

1155
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,160
We've now got two groups working on the puzzle.

1156
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,160
Look for small pieces that go towards the tail.

1157
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,160
And purple is now back in it thanks to Adam.

1158
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,160
I'm here, come on Jess, come on.

1159
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,160
Everybody working on the puzzle now.

1160
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:46,160
Ken, Will and Jay have had a big head start working on this puzzle for a while.

1161
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
There we go.

1162
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,160
Jessica, Hannah, Adam, and Jessica are all working on the puzzle.

1163
00:53:50,160 --> 00:54:09,160
Brett, Zeke and Sunday are making a lot of progress very quickly.

1164
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,960
It is now Will, Ken and Jay that are trying to catch up.

1165
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,160
Look at the piece that we need next and look forward on the table.

1166
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,160
Suddenly all three teams are in this.

1167
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,160
That is why you never, ever give up.

1168
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Oh my God.

1169
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,160
Three people will join David on a massive reward.

1170
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,160
There we go.

1171
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,160
There we go.

1172
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,160
Brett with another piece.

1173
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,160
That's it.

1174
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,160
Try that again.

1175
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,160
Out of nowhere it is Brett, Zeke and Sunday about to close the door on this.

1176
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,160
Let's go, keep going, keep going.

1177
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,160
There we go, there we go.

1178
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
There we go, there we go.

1179
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,160
Yes, yes, yes!

1180
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
They think they have it.

1181
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,160
And they do!

1182
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,160
Yes!

1183
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:50,160
A massive comeback for Brett, Zeke and Sunday's reward chopper ride of Survivor Picnic.

1184
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,160
We get our helicopter ride.

1185
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,160
I got naked on Survivor.

1186
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Sunday, Brett, Zeke and David, come on over.

1187
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160
Your ride is coming in right now.

1188
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:11,160
Oh my God.

1189
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:17,160
I have an advantage in this game that allows me to steal a reward from another player.

1190
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:23,160
I was very tempted to use it, especially because David didn't earn this one.

1191
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:35,160
But I felt like it was the best decision for me to hang on to my advantage and save it for another day.

1192
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:41,160
All right, Adam, Jessica, Hannah, Ken, Jay, Will, got nothing for you, grab your stuff, head back to camp.

1193
00:55:41,160 --> 00:56:06,160
My dream was not only to get on Survivor, but to win a helicopter reward.

1194
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,160
So this ranks up there as one of my favorite days, literally ever in my life.

1195
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,160
I feel like I'm 10 years old.

1196
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,160
Cheers.

1197
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
Cheers.

1198
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
Oh, cheers, guys.

1199
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,160
Wow.

1200
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,160
Zeke, here we go again, brother.

1201
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Here we go again.

1202
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,160
I got a nice buzz on, I'll tell you that right now.

1203
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,160
My new drinking buddy is Brett.

1204
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,160
I don't really like to drink beer, but I really want to cultivate a relationship with Brett.

1205
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,160
So if he wants me to be his new drinking buddy, I'm his new drinking buddy.

1206
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,160
I need to take a walk.

1207
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,160
I'm going to take some beer and wine with me.

1208
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,160
Yeah, do something, will you?

1209
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,160
Really cool.

1210
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,160
And then there were two.

1211
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
And then there were two.

1212
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,160
Two drunks.

1213
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,160
Don't talk about anything important while I'm gone.

1214
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,160
No, I won't.

1215
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Two drunks sitting on a beach in Fiji.

1216
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
My drinking buddy.

1217
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,160
My drinking buddy.

1218
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,160
Well, it's nice breaking bread with you.

1219
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,160
We're going to be part of each other's lives, whether we like it or not.

1220
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,160
You know, I've been a big fan of Survivor, and it's just a part of my life.

1221
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:59,160
And as I get older, you start to learn who you really are, and you start to not care what people think.

1222
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,160
What's up?

1223
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,160
I'm trying to get closer to Zeke, because I want to work with Zeke.

1224
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160
And I just like him as a person.

1225
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,160
My family's going to play it down in the cave, so.

1226
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,160
Yeah, we'll do it if we can, like, you know, in like July or August or whatever.

1227
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,160
Absolutely.

1228
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,160
Right on.

1229
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,160
Yeah.

1230
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:18,160
Well, I will tell you, you're not the only gay guy out here.

1231
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,160
You?

1232
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,160
I'm playing a game here.

1233
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,160
Fine, dude.

1234
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,160
I was going to tell everyone, and then I had, you know, macho group.

1235
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,160
I had Ken, Chris.

1236
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Sure.

1237
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,160
I was like, I got to shut my mouth here.

1238
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,160
Yeah, yeah.

1239
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,160
So it just didn't happen.

1240
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,160
Oh, yeah.

1241
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,160
It will, brother.

1242
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,160
Right on.

1243
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
I'm a different generation.

1244
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,160
No, I understand.

1245
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,160
You know, we don't talk about it.

1246
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,160
It's different for everybody.

1247
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,160
Yeah.

1248
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,160
I didn't grow up in a time when it was normal to talk about being gay.

1249
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,160
And the millennials do not care.

1250
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,160
Zeke finds comfort in being himself, and I think that's great.

1251
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:54,160
And I'm hoping that, you know, as my life goes on from here on out, I can be that way.

1252
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,160
I've never had a problem.

1253
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Like, you tell your friends, nobody cares.

1254
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
You know what I mean?

1255
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,160
It's just in my head.

1256
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,160
It's been in my head my whole life, you know?

1257
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,160
Yeah.

1258
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,160
So it's, but, you know, you become forward and you're like, I don't care what anyone

1259
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,160
thinks anymore.

1260
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,160
You know what I mean?

1261
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,160
I am who I am.

1262
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,160
I have great friends.

1263
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,160
I do whatever I do.

1264
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,160
You know what I mean?

1265
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,160
Yeah, no.

1266
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,160
It's interesting because, like, I never thought about not saying anything.

1267
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,160
All right.

1268
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,160
I've lived with not saying anything.

1269
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,160
So for me to come out here and not say anything...

1270
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,160
It's life.

1271
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,160
I've lived like that.

1272
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,160
Well, you have to, like, play Survivor the way you live your life.

1273
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,160
You know?

1274
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,160
That's like, I think you can't try to do something new on Survivor.

1275
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,160
I owe a lot to Brett's generation.

1276
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:42,160
I would not be able to come out at 15 were they're not the pioneers who paved the way.

1277
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,160
And I think it really reflects this millennial Gen X divide, right?

1278
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,160
He spent time in the military during the Don't Ask, Don't Tell era where he couldn't have

1279
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,160
been in the military if he told people he was gay.

1280
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,160
And I'm excited that now Brett is getting a chance to, like, reap the rewards of what

1281
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,160
he has sowed.

1282
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,160
Cheers.

1283
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,160
Cheers, brother.

1284
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,160
So Zeke and I were starting to talk.

1285
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Yeah.

1286
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,160
But we wanted to wait till you get back.

1287
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,160
Oh, thank you.

1288
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,160
So what's your thoughts on...

1289
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,160
David?

1290
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,160
Yeah.

1291
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,160
I'm nervous.

1292
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,160
I'm nervous, too.

1293
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
You?

1294
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,160
I'm nervous.

1295
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,160
I'm glad he's here.

1296
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
Me, too.

1297
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,160
So I can...

1298
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,160
I know what he's up to, you know?

1299
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,160
I think, like, if we can get Jay and Will on board, then I can bring in Hannah.

1300
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,160
We can pull off the blind side.

1301
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,160
We just have to make sure David doesn't sense that we're coming for him.

1302
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,160
Right.

1303
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,160
Brett and I, we've got, like, the rainbow connection.

1304
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:37,160
And Brett, Sunday, and I, we're all like, David's the biggest threat in this game.

1305
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:42,160
And I am delighted to hear this because now, I think, I have united them against an enemy,

1306
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:50,160
and they are my loyal soldiers.

1307
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,160
Hey, kids.

1308
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,160
Hello.

1309
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,160
Hey, Hannah.

1310
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,160
Was it cool?

1311
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,160
It was great.

1312
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,160
It was all right.

1313
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,160
Shut up, Brett.

1314
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,160
You loza.

1315
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,160
So the winners get back, Zeke, Brett, Sunday, and David, and I immediately grab David.

1316
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,160
Yeah.

1317
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,160
Yeah.

1318
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,160
I've never...

1319
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,160
I'm playing between you and David.

1320
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,160
Yeah.

1321
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,160
I'm playing between David and Zeke, but I'm going with my gut, and my decision is to go

1322
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:21,160
after Zeke because Zeke, he's condescending, and he can be a flip-flopper.

1323
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,160
Go ahead.

1324
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,160
So Brett tells Zeke, you're gunning for him.

1325
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,160
Zeke turns to Adam and tells him you have an idol.

1326
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,160
Oh.

1327
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,160
But don't freak out.

1328
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,160
Don't freak out because here's the good part.

1329
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
Wait, wait, wait.

1330
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,160
What is the good part?

1331
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,160
No, no, this is the good part.

1332
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
Ready?

1333
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
What?

1334
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,160
The good part is, Zeke trusts me.

1335
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,160
No, but, I mean, I appreciate that, but...

1336
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
No, no, no, no, no.

1337
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,160
So if he's going to make a move against you, I'm going to know.

1338
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,160
Okay, here's the deal, Hannah.

1339
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,160
My idol, it's for me and it's for you.

1340
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,160
Okay.

1341
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,160
Okay?

1342
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,160
Okay, Brett's walking up.

1343
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,160
He's walking up?

1344
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,160
He's walking towards the water.

1345
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,160
He's just there.

1346
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,160
So here's the thing.

1347
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,160
You're making me so nervous and Brett just...

1348
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,160
We should stop looking.

1349
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,160
Zeke is now telling people that I have an idol at the very...

1350
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,160
Oh, here comes Jay.

1351
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,160
Oh, my God.

1352
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:14,160
You look beautiful, like a Peruvian Ozzy.

1353
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,160
Here's the other thing.

1354
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Hannah, Hannah, I blew up my game, clearly.

1355
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
No, you didn't.

1356
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,160
I blew up my game.

1357
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160
No, you didn't.

1358
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,160
Hannah tells me that Brett told Zeke that I'm gunning for him, which is, like, complete

1359
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,160
miscalculation on my part.

1360
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,160
I'm sorry.

1361
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,160
No, no, no, no.

1362
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,160
I knew you'd be upset.

1363
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,160
I know you're not.

1364
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,160
You're not.

1365
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,160
Hey, hey.

1366
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,160
Don't get neurotic on me.

1367
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,160
I'm not.

1368
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,160
Because then you're gonna waste your idol.

1369
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,160
Here's...

1370
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,160
Okay, can I pitch something?

1371
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,160
We go after Zeke now.

1372
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,160
Let the vote be me.

1373
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,160
I play my idol.

1374
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,160
Zeke goes home.

1375
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
I want to see where Zeke's head is at.

1376
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,160
If Zeke finds out I'm working with you, then I'm...

1377
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Hey!

1378
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
Hey!

1379
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,160
Hey!

1380
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,160
Hey!

1381
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,160
Hey!

1382
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,160
Hey!

1383
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,160
Hey!

1384
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,160
Hey!

1385
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,160
Hey!

1386
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,160
Hey!

1387
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,160
Hey!

1388
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,160
Hey!

1389
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,160
Hey!

1390
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
Hey!

1391
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
Hey!

1392
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,160
Hey!

1393
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,160
Hey!

1394
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,160
Hey!

1395
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,160
Hey!

1396
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,160
Hey!

1397
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,160
Hey!

1398
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,160
Hey!

1399
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,160
Hey!

1400
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,160
Hey!

1401
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,160
Hey!

1402
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,160
Hey!

1403
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,160
Hey!

1404
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,160
Hey!

1405
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,160
Hey!

1406
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,160
Hey!

1407
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,160
Hey!

1408
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,160
Come on in, guys!

1409
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:26,880
All right, shall we get to today's immunity challenge?

1410
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,880
Yes!

1411
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,880
First things first, David.

1412
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,200
I need to give it up.

1413
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,280
I know you do.

1414
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,560
Once again, immunity is back up for grabs.

1415
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,520
For today's challenge, you're gonna stand behind a cage door,

1416
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:45,200
and you'll maneuver a handle through a maze.

1417
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,520
Once your handle's free, you'll unlock the door

1418
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:54,640
and race to complete a slide puzzle.

1419
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,920
First person to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-nine shot

1420
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
at winning this game.

1421
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,740
Losers, tribal council, somebody will become

1422
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,480
the fourth member of our jury.

1423
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Draw for spots.

1424
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:12,480
We'll get started.

1425
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,280
All right, here we go.

1426
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,280
For immunity, survivors ready?

1427
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,280
Go!

1428
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,640
First, you've got to untie your handle.

1429
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:29,360
Then you start working it through the maze.

1430
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,520
You are blind, you cannot see where the maze is leading,

1431
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:41,440
so you have to do all of this by touch.

1432
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,080
This is gonna be about trying pathways that work,

1433
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,360
and then running into a dead end, and trying to remember,

1434
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,000
I don't want to go back there.

1435
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Where was that?

1436
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,240
How'd I get out of here?

1437
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,280
So easy for me, I can just follow the color.

1438
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,240
I know if you're doing well or not.

1439
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,880
I will not be saying who is in the lead and who is falling behind.

1440
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:17,760
You will not know where you are in the maze until you're out of it.

1441
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,800
Everybody trying to figure this out, is there a pattern?

1442
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,400
Am I at the same dead end?

1443
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:28,240
You can use your hands to try to feel ahead, or you can just go for it.

1444
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,200
But if somebody gets through this quickly,

1445
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:42,400
you will have a giant start on that slide puzzle.

1446
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,800
Jay has his free.

1447
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,280
Jay is through his door.

1448
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,520
Jay can start working on the slide puzzle.

1449
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,920
Now we got it going on.

1450
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:01,720
Now you are trying to catch Jay.

1451
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,280
Jay quickly gets to work on that puzzle, sliding pieces around.

1452
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:13,440
It looks so close, and you can be one piece off, and it's a setback.

1453
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,400
This could be over quickly if Jay is good at slide puzzles.

1454
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,280
Mechanic now really setting in.

1455
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:32,800
Am I even close, do I have a shot?

1456
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,240
Jay thinks he has it.

1457
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,120
That looks like the survivor logo to me.

1458
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,120
Jay wins individual immunity.

1459
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,960
Not even close.

1460
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,040
Nobody even out of their maze.

1461
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,680
That is an official survivor blowout.

1462
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,160
Wow.

1463
01:05:52,160 --> 01:06:01,120
Jay, come on over.

1464
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,120
It was pretty to watch.

1465
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,400
It's because I was in pink, Jeff.

1466
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,400
Individual immunity.

1467
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,200
Jay, safe tonight at Tribal Council.

1468
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,840
You will not be going home.

1469
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,120
As for the rest of you, 30 days is a long time to play this game.

1470
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,280
But for one of you, that's as far as it goes.

1471
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,880
Somebody voted out will become the fourth member of our jury.

1472
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,880
It won't be you.

1473
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,200
Grab your stuff, head back to camp.

1474
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:40,160
See you tonight at Tribal.

1475
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
Thank you.

1476
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,680
Thank you, guys.

1477
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,440
We had an immunity challenge today, and guess who came out?

1478
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,440
Champion.

1479
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,440
Oh, boy.

1480
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,440
I did.

1481
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,440
I won.

1482
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,440
I crushed these fools.

1483
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,440
So who are you going to give it to?

1484
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,440
For this one?

1485
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,640
I think it's going to stay there.

1486
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,480
And surprise, I still have an idol.

1487
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,480
But I'm not playing it tonight.

1488
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,560
I saved it so long for myself, I'm going to keep it for myself.

1489
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:06,120
Boy, I deserted up here quick.

1490
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,120
Is it just you and I?

1491
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,120
It appears that way.

1492
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,200
I have a favor to ask you.

1493
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:17,360
Basically, all I did, I was trying to lure Brent and Sunday over to our side.

1494
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:21,880
And I told Brent that I'm like, you know who the biggest threat in this game is?

1495
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,880
And you know who it is, right?

1496
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,880
Oh, Zeke.

1497
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,880
Exactly.

1498
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,880
Yeah, that's not a good thing that you did.

1499
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,640
I need us to write down Zeke's name tonight.

1500
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,640
You, me, and Ken.

1501
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,240
Why are we doing that?

1502
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,000
Because he's gunning for me tonight.

1503
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,680
Oh, Lord.

1504
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,760
I have to protect David and vote for Zeke.

1505
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,760
Because David actually played a hidden immunity idol for me.

1506
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:46,120
But if David had just let well enough alone and not said anything, this wouldn't be happening.

1507
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,600
Zeke.

1508
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:51,880
Zeke is going to vote David.

1509
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm going to stay with David.

1510
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,120
I made a promise to the man that I would never put his name down.

1511
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:00,600
And so I want to go out swinging and fighting with David in this game.

1512
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,840
Like, I want to work with you.

1513
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:07,420
David is a guaranteed winner who has an idol.

1514
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,880
So would you say that overall, like ranking threats, that David is the most threatening

1515
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,880
person in the game?

1516
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:16,440
Uh.

1517
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,680
Would you agree with that assessment?

1518
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,240
It said a little harshly, but I just.

1519
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,280
No, here, just, just, Ken, is that fair?

1520
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,160
Because I'm trying to make a larger point.

1521
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,440
I know, I'm thinking.

1522
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,560
I have attempted to cultivate Hannah as a very, very close ally.

1523
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:41,160
And as we're talking, it becomes very clear to me that Hannah does not have my best interest

1524
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,160
at heart.

1525
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,960
You don't talk to David and tell him I'm like coming for him hardcore, are you?

1526
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,600
You both know you're coming for each other.

1527
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,560
Right, but you don't like talk to him about that, do you?

1528
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:53,120
David, through the grave, like, you both know it.

1529
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,120
Right.

1530
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,880
I think this is a question of whether or not you're going to play the rest of this game

1531
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,800
with David or you're going to play the rest of this game with me.

1532
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,400
Okay.

1533
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,920
I realize that I'm no longer going to be working with Hannah.

1534
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
The vote.

1535
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,160
I'm going to be David, but David has an idol and if David plays an idol, we're screwed.

1536
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:17,800
So if Hannah wants to become one of David's numbers, she becomes my enemy and I have no

1537
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,280
problem voting her out of the game.

1538
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,080
Hannah is in David's pocket.

1539
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,720
We can vote for Hannah.

1540
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,720
I don't trust Hannah.

1541
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Yeah, I need to do it.

1542
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,720
Hannah is in David's pocket.

1543
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,720
I think so.

1544
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1545
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,720
So I'm going to vote Hannah.

1546
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,720
Okay.

1547
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,720
Okay, we got it.

1548
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,720
Okay, we got it.

1549
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,720
Okay.

1550
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,720
J. I'm ready, Hannah.

1551
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,720
H-A-N-N-H.

1552
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,720
That's how you spell her?

1553
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,480
Yeah.

1554
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,280
Deal, I'm going to write Hannah.

1555
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,920
We've come to the day where it's going to be either David's army or my army.

1556
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,560
So I'm trusting Brett and Sunday and Jay and Will.

1557
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:59,080
So we have five votes together, which is half, which means at worst we talk.

1558
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,720
Zika Roni wants David out.

1559
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,720
Right.

1560
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,720
David wants Zika Roni out.

1561
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,480
What you and I need to do is stick together and choose a side.

1562
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,840
I trust you because you and I genuinely want to sit at the end and switch houses.

1563
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Yeah.

1564
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,840
Yeah, so what do you want me to do?

1565
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,840
Who do we vote for?

1566
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:14,840
Zika.

1567
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:22,720
Hannah wants to vote for Zika tonight, but I'm not confident about the plan tonight because

1568
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:28,320
I have been sitting back a little bit and allowing Hannah to run the show a little bit.

1569
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,320
And Hannah is a nervous girl and it makes me nervous.

1570
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,320
Adam wants to work with me.

1571
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,320
I'm with you 120%.

1572
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,320
So who do we have then?

1573
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,320
Just...

1574
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:44,200
Me, you, Adam, Jess, Kenneth, all vote for Zeke, which gives us five.

1575
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,880
But if they put five in five, I'm the one they're going to target.

1576
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,760
Well, you don't know that's just a gut feeling.

1577
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,760
You're nervous.

1578
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:51,760
You're getting neurotic.

1579
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,760
No, Zeke, he doesn't trust me.

1580
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,000
I just, I have a feeling, I know it's me.

1581
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,440
I'm probably going to need your idol tonight.

1582
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,440
Right.

1583
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,480
My OCD is going crazy right now.

1584
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,320
It's like the anxiety is like too much.

1585
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,000
My body can't handle it.

1586
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,240
I feel like David should play his idol for me because if the vote changes at all, it's

1587
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,240
going to be against me.

1588
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:17,360
If it is a five-five tie, let's say I did play the idol for you and it's not you, then

1589
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,560
there's a revote.

1590
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:25,240
It'll probably come back as a tie again and then rocks get drawn.

1591
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,920
Tonight is huge.

1592
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:31,360
If we really do have five votes and there's no really anymore, who the hell knows what's

1593
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,440
happening?

1594
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:37,360
But if we really do have five votes against Zeke, then it would be a tie and then we'll

1595
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,080
have to revote and it will require somebody flipping.

1596
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:49,120
Question is, who would flip my people, their people?

1597
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,640
But I'm not even sure that it will be five-five.

1598
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:56,040
So I'm really schizophrenic about what I'm going to do with my idol.

1599
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,560
I hope I play the idol for the right person.

1600
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,360
This is really the scariest part of the game for me thus far.

1601
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,240
Now bring in the members of our jury.

1602
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:29,240
Michelle, Taylor, and Chris voted out at the Last Tribal Council.

1603
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,400
Alright, so let's get into this.

1604
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:40,280
At the Last Tribal Council, I asked how many people are pretty certain you know where the

1605
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,400
vote is going and quite a few of you said 100%.

1606
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,240
How many people tonight feel the same way?

1607
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,960
Nobody?

1608
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,960
Wow.

1609
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:56,440
Okay, how many of you feel some sense of security that it won't be you tonight?

1610
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,800
You're the only one.

1611
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:03,920
David, is it going to be just another crazy vote or is this a turning point in the game?

1612
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,920
You know, I don't know.

1613
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,920
Here's the deal.

1614
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,040
I feel like one of those fruit bats back at camp.

1615
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,960
Like the world looks upside down right now.

1616
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,680
This is like the most chaotic tribal I think we've seen yet, or at least it's about to

1617
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,680
be.

1618
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,680
Really?

1619
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,680
Yeah.

1620
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,480
Alright, that to me says the gameplay is so good.

1621
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,840
You guys are playing as if this is your second time, but it's not.

1622
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,160
Yeah, I mean honestly everyone here is playing full on pedal to the metal.

1623
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:32,040
Let's do this because everyone's such a super fan of this game.

1624
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,240
See all this whispering.

1625
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,720
I don't know what is even being said.

1626
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,320
David, you're sitting almost smack dab in the middle.

1627
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,480
Yeah, this is what's known as a trust cluster muck.

1628
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,840
Oh, there's no clusters.

1629
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,120
There's a must, there's knock that crap off, alright?

1630
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,440
Brett, why did that get you so upset?

1631
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,600
Because this trust cluster, enough with this.

1632
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,600
Give me a break, okay?

1633
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,880
This is every man for himself right now.

1634
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,880
I mean this is insane.

1635
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,320
Listen, you talk, you hope what's being told you is correct and you move forward, you know?

1636
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,800
Well would members of Zeke's Alliance like to raise their hands?

1637
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,800
Oh David.

1638
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
The members of David's Alliance like to raise their hands.

1639
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,040
Oh no, I'm going to cry because I've got anxiety.

1640
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,040
Oh don't cry David.

1641
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,040
Oh stop.

1642
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,040
Is this affecting you?

1643
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,040
Okay, let's not bully.

1644
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,040
That's a personal attack.

1645
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,040
I haven't personally attacked anybody.

1646
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,040
Personal attack.

1647
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,040
Personal attack.

1648
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,040
Alright, alright.

1649
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:25,880
But that's where we're at right now.

1650
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,280
I don't even know what to say.

1651
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,200
Adam, what are you thinking right now?

1652
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,200
Are you nervous?

1653
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,920
Hell yes, I'm nervous, Jeff.

1654
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:38,360
I am now less sure of what was going on than I was when I walked into tribal council tonight.

1655
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,200
The vote is still very much live.

1656
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,440
Jessica, you look like, huh?

1657
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,440
How could it be live?

1658
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,440
What's going on?

1659
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,880
I am so utterly confused right now.

1660
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,960
I really have no idea what's happening.

1661
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,960
Wow.

1662
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,800
Ken, how do we know when it's time to say pencil's down, let's vote?

1663
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,760
Yeah, we got the guillotine ready, the knife's about to drop and we're still trying to figure

1664
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,000
out whose head are we throwing under.

1665
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I've never seen anything like this.

1666
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
There's so many conversations happening right here.

1667
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,600
I'm curious why we're so easily mixed up by someone simply whispering from us.

1668
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,600
That's insane.

1669
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,600
Ken, this is the game.

1670
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,600
I'm going to do it.

1671
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,600
Whoa.

1672
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,640
Oh, I'm know, I'm very well aware of that, Brett.

1673
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,640
What are we doing right now?

1674
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,040
That's what I'm asking.

1675
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,160
This is all smoke and mirrors, huh?

1676
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,480
You know, that's all nonsense.

1677
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,480
Smoke and mirrors.

1678
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:32,600
So Zeke, is tonight's vote about what is really true and what is just one big facade?

1679
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:38,040
Yeah, everyone wonders who they can trust, who they think they're voting with.

1680
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:42,160
I don't think anyone feels sure that those they have had conversations with are going

1681
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,080
to do what they said they were going to do.

1682
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,080
Wow.

1683
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,760
You know, Tribal Council's theater, Jeff, and I think we've proven that tonight.

1684
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,120
I say we vote.

1685
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,120
Should we vote?

1686
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,120
Yeah.

1687
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,120
Yeah, no, let's vote.

1688
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,760
All right, it is time to vote.

1689
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,760
Will, you're up.

1690
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,460
Oh.

1691
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:12,640
Oh.

1692
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:22,720
Oh my God.

1693
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,220
What the hell off me?

1694
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,220
What the...

1695
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:51,260
I'll go tally the votes.

1696
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,860
If anybody has a hidden immunity item and you want to play it, now would be the time

1697
01:16:54,860 --> 01:17:04,520
to do so.

1698
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,520
Sorry Jeff.

1699
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,520
What?

1700
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,520
Wait.

1701
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:19,720
Uh, here you go Jeff.

1702
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,000
Hold on.

1703
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,200
They were whispering over here that they want to vote for Ken.

1704
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,280
Wow.

1705
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,000
Jeff the idol is for...

1706
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Ken.

1707
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Whoa.

1708
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:43,880
All right, any votes cast for Ken will not count.

1709
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:44,880
Damn.

1710
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,520
I'll read the votes.

1711
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,480
First vote.

1712
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,480
Zeke.

1713
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,480
Hannah.

1714
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,000
Damn it.

1715
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Knew it.

1716
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,040
Told you.

1717
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,760
Zeke.

1718
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,760
Hannah.

1719
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,760
Two votes Zeke.

1720
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,760
Two votes Hannah.

1721
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,440
Zeke.

1722
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,440
We're tied again.

1723
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,440
Three votes Zeke.

1724
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,440
Three votes Hannah.

1725
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,880
Zeke.

1726
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,880
We're tied again.

1727
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,880
Four votes Zeke.

1728
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,880
Four votes Hannah.

1729
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,520
Zeke.

1730
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,040
That's five votes Zeke.

1731
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,480
Four votes Hannah.

1732
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,480
One vote left.

1733
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,200
Hannah.

1734
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,200
We're tied.

1735
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,520
So here's what's going to happen.

1736
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,920
We're going to have a revote.

1737
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,240
Hannah and Zeke, you will not vote.

1738
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:49,280
Everybody else, you can only vote for Hannah or Zeke.

1739
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,280
Will you come grab the urn?

1740
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,280
Oh, I'd love to, Jeff.

1741
01:18:51,280 --> 01:19:20,280
I have real line with people all the time.

1742
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,280
Jessica.

1743
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,280
Jessica.

1744
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,280
Oh my God.

1745
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,280
Oh my God.

1746
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,280
I'm just gonna flip up here.

1747
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:52,280
I'm just gonna flip up here.

1748
01:19:52,280 --> 01:20:04,280
I'll go tally the votes.

1749
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:09,280
I'll read the votes.

1750
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,280
Hannah.

1751
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,280
Zeke.

1752
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,280
Hannah.

1753
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,280
Zeke.

1754
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,280
Two votes Hannah.

1755
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,280
Two votes Zeke.

1756
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,280
Hannah.

1757
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,280
Zeke.

1758
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,280
Tied again.

1759
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,280
Three votes Hannah.

1760
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,280
Three votes Zeke.

1761
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,280
Hannah.

1762
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,280
That's four votes Hannah.

1763
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,280
Three votes Zeke.

1764
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,280
One vote left.

1765
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,280
Zeke.

1766
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,280
Oh my God.

1767
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,280
We are deadlocked.

1768
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,280
Here's what will happen.

1769
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:47,280
Per the rules of Survivor, if the eight of you can unanimously agree on either Hannah

1770
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:52,280
or Zeke, they go home.

1771
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:59,280
If you cannot unanimously agree, then Hannah and Zeke become immune and they join Jay and

1772
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,280
Ken, and all four become safe.

1773
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:09,280
And Will, Brett, Sunday, Adam, David and Jessica will all draw rocks.

1774
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,280
The odd rock goes home.

1775
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:16,280
This is a do or die moment right now.

1776
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:20,280
Guys, can the eight of us agree that none of us are willing to give up our games for

1777
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,280
either one of these two?

1778
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,280
I don't want to go home tonight.

1779
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,280
I don't want to go home tonight.

1780
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,280
I don't think anybody wants to go home tonight.

1781
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,280
So let the eight of us come to a decision on one or the other because I'm not going

1782
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,280
home.

1783
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,280
And if I can pitch something, I really do believe that Zeke is playing the best game

1784
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,280
of the people up here, but if you really believe that I am, then fine, just vote me out next.

1785
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,280
But tonight it has to be Zeke.

1786
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,280
David is never going to let me stay in this game and neither is Adam.

1787
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,280
Who wants to vote Hannah?

1788
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,280
Who wants to vote Hannah?

1789
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,280
Right here.

1790
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,280
You wanted Jessica.

1791
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,280
I was trying to get you to actually go home with that plan.

1792
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,280
Who did you vote for?

1793
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,280
You voted for Chris.

1794
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,280
You said you wanted to vote for Chris.

1795
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,280
I never said that and I didn't vote for Chris.

1796
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,280
I don't want to draw rocks.

1797
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,280
I do not want to draw rocks.

1798
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,280
Well, it's going to go there.

1799
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,280
So what I'm hearing right now is complete disarray.

1800
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,280
We don't have a unanimous decision.

1801
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,280
Wow.

1802
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,280
So here's what has now happened.

1803
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,280
Oh, boy.

1804
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:19,280
Because you guys can't control your own fate by coming to an agreement, Hannah, who was in trouble, is safe.

1805
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,280
Zeke, who is in trouble, is safe.

1806
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,280
Jay has immunity.

1807
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,280
He's safe.

1808
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,280
Ken has the immunity idol thanks to David.

1809
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,280
He's safe.

1810
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,280
So six people will draw rocks.

1811
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,280
Will, Brett, Sunday, Adam, David and Jessica.

1812
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:41,280
One of you is about to go home after 30 days in Survivor by making the biggest move you can in this game, going to rocks.

1813
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,280
Wow.

1814
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,280
There are five white rocks.

1815
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,280
There was one black rock.

1816
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
White means you're safe.

1817
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,280
Black means you're going home.

1818
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,280
All right.

1819
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,280
Oh, my God.

1820
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,280
Grab it and don't look.

1821
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,280
Jeff, I think I'm going to cry.

1822
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,280
All right.

1823
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,280
Million-dollar rock draw.

1824
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,280
Black means you are out of this game.

1825
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,280
Reveal.

1826
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,280
Oh, my God.

1827
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,280
Jessica.

1828
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,280
Sorry, Jessica.

1829
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,280
I didn't want to go to rock.

1830
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,280
David did.

1831
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:30,280
Oh, my God.

1832
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,280
You played a great game.

1833
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,280
Great job, Jessica.

1834
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:40,280
Jessica, I think it's more appropriate tonight to say the game has spoken.

1835
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,280
It's time for you to go.

1836
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,280
We drew rocks.

1837
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,280
Now I'm out of the game.

1838
01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:01,280
I found the legacy advantage, but since I'm not in the game anymore, I have to will this to somebody.

1839
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:08,280
So I am leaving this legacy advantage to Ken, and I hope that he will be able to do it.

1840
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,280
I'm going to go to rock.

1841
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,280
I'm going to go to rock.

1842
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,280
I'm going to go to rock.

1843
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,280
I'm going to go to rock.

1844
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,280
I'm going to go to rock.

1845
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,280
I found the legacy advantage to Ken.

1846
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:26,280
And I hope that he is here on day 36 so he can take advantage of whatever is contained within this envelope.

1847
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:34,280
Well, drawing rocks is the ultimate survivor, all-in move.

1848
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:42,280
And with this many people making an all-in move, it says the rest of this game is going to be insane.

1849
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,280
Grab your torches, head back to camp.

1850
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,280
I'm gonna set back to camp.

1851
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,280
Good night.

1852
01:24:46,280 --> 01:25:05,400
Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

1853
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,520
Next time on Survivor, David gets a glimmer of hope.

1854
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,320
David, I'm ready to start playing this game hard.

1855
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,480
I'm an endangered species, but there was music to my ears.

1856
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,600
And the loved ones visit.

1857
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,920
I think it is a perfect time for love.

1858
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,160
Oh, my God.

1859
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,240
Eclipse the game.

1860
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,160
I actually have an advantage in this game.

1861
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:31,040
This truly has been the most incredible experience that I could have ever hoped for.

1862
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:35,840
I'm incredibly proud of myself that I've made it as far as I have, but if I had just switched

1863
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,520
my vote to Hannah, I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

1864
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,520
Hannah would be.

1865
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,520
Oh, my God.

1866
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,520
I'm so proud of you.

1867
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,520
I'm so proud of you.

1868
01:25:43,520 --> 01:26:12,080
I'm so proud of you.
