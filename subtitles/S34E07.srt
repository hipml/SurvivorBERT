1
00:00:00,556 --> 00:00:02,962
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:05,948
In the Mana tribe,

3
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:09,860
Hali and Michaela were left out of Culpepper's alliance.

4
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:12,654
I have people with whom I want to move forward.

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,165
In the Nuku tribe,

6
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:17,110
Varner knew his game was breaking down.

7
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:20,361
If I leave tonight, I'll bring them all to their knees.

8
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:23,307
At the council,

9
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,983
Varner made a desperate blow.

10
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:28,170
There is deception here.

11
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,863
Deception on one level, Jeff,

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,807
that they don't even understand.

13
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,376
Why didn't you tell anyone you were transgender?

14
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,895
But it's personal.

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,595
He does not deceive us at all.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,708
It's personal. You should not have done that.

17
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,451
It's disgusting to mention that.

18
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,187
We don't have the right to do that.

19
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,020
And he was eliminated.

20
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,772
Varner, the tribe has spoken.

21
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:53,729
There are 13 left.

22
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,779
Who will be eliminated tonight?

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,481
Last night each of you

24
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,667
forgave Varner. I don't forgive him.

25
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,586
And it is your right. No problem.

26
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,647
I wanted to comfort him a little.

27
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:23,141
Out of sympathy. I am like this.

28
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:24,697
No problem.

29
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:26,446
No problem for me.

30
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:29,812
I hope you don't blame me... Not at all.

31
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,013
He took so much from Zeke.

32
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:35,304
Thinking about it, it bothers me.

33
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,849
I come from a very conservative background.

34
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,311
I didn't know a transgender person before.

35
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,343
And to have been with Zeke,

36
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:47,567
to have known him, as a person,

37
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:49,324
since the first day,

38
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,005
i love this guy.

39
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,956
And it doesn't change

40
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,469
who he is to me.

41
00:01:55,594 --> 00:01:58,286
Ultimately, it strengthens our bonds.

42
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,730
So this morning I woke up, and Zeke is Zeke.

43
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,390
It's almost unreal.

44
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:05,134
To me, you're just Zeke.

45
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,260
You see ?

46
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:09,502
Yeah. I don't want people crying, screaming,

47
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,042
so I was just, well... No worries.

48
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,770
I know, but that wasn't cool.

49
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:16,311
No, indeed.

50
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,538
And I was very touched by your reactions.

51
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:23,741
I didn't say it especially so that people would see me as I am.

52
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,187
Often in my life

53
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:29,220
when I say I'm trans, that's what we're talking about.

54
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:33,295
And everything else is set aside.

55
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,967
But Survivor makes you strong, enduring, more flexible.

56
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,667
I think I had these qualities before,

57
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,059
but they have been strengthened and developed.

58
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:46,533
I think I was able to show myself a little more courageous,

59
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:49,185
a little bolder, to help others,

60
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,248
and also to overcome my own fears,

61
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,526
exceed...

62
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,381
...My problems, complexes and anxieties

63
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,253
related to being transgender.

64
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,323
I'm glad we got past that.

65
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,727
It brought us closer.

66
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,987
I really like my playmates.

67
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:10,866
And it's comforting, in this game, that often,

68
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,209
when you're down, something ugly happens to you,

69
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:18,445
people who, in a sense, are your enemies,

70
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:21,340
come to your defense.

71
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:22,797
I was really touched.

72
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,137
But at the same time,

73
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:28,617
there is still a job to do, which I am determined to accomplish.

74
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:31,751
I'm here to make a million, to play Survivor.

75
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:34,073
It's time to get back to it.

76
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:40,596
Over here, everyone!

77
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,201
We come to the test

78
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,428
and there is a buffet on a table.

79
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,139
So I say to myself:

80
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,899
"Wow, a fusion feast!"

81
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,174
So we are happy.

82
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,010
Oh my God ! Look !

83
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,673
But at the same time,

84
00:03:56,798 --> 00:03:59,139
there's Jeff, next to a covered table.

85
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:00,908
So I'm like, "Oh, oh!

86
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,609
Something is off."

87
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,122
My heart is pounding.

88
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,510
Sierra, arriving

89
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,706
and noticing the fusion feast,

90
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,855
you said, "My heart is racing."

91
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,465
It's always like that.

92
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,333
I'm starving.

93
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,761
Ozzy.

94
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,251
How important is food at this stage?

95
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,826
We are all incredibly hungry

96
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:28,769
and are hyper aware of the importance of this,

97
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,915
just like what's underneath.

98
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:36,710
Interesting. Because it's about to come into play.

99
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,823
Before officially merging,

100
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:46,028
you have one last decision to make in tribes.

101
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,744
To be able to enjoy this splendid meal,

102
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:51,325
a person

103
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,493
of each tribe

104
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,993
must accept

105
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,340
not to take part.

106
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,215
Oh my God !

107
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,639
If we don't have two volunteers,

108
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,389
one in each tribe,

109
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:33,942
who renounce the feast,

110
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,310
the feast disappears,

111
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,280
and instead you will celebrate merging

112
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,841
with a biscuit per person and a sip of cold tea.

113
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:43,487
Oh my God !

114
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,065
Big dilemma.

115
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:47,739
Zeke.

116
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,892
This decision has several levels, it's complicated.

117
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,930
On the one hand, I could allow my allies to eat,

118
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,533
if I was ready to accept the burden.

119
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,097
On the other hand, I might need that energy,

120
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:01,937
because I could be targeted.

121
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,468
I'll do it, it's good.

122
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,465
It's good, it's good.

123
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,078
I'm not trying to... I can fish, I promise.

124
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,204
Culpepper.

125
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,748
You immediately said, "I'll do it."

126
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,175
Its good.

127
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,385
That's what Monica would do.

128
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:20,248
The Thing, with Brad Culpepper,

129
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:24,226
is that I doubt he liked his image in Blood vs. Water.

130
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,628
So he sacrifices himself

131
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,264
to be the hero, the great supplier.

132
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,879
It's part of the "Culpepper brand",

133
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:33,902
to sacrifice for others.

134
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:36,638
Well, we have a volunteer for Mana.

135
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,807
Nuku. Difficult decision.

136
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,343
Is anyone ready to say, "I'll do it." ?

137
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:43,370
I don't think I can do it.

138
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:55,557
It's decided.

139
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,401
Tai, is it decided? Yes.

140
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,896
I believe they will benefit more than me.

141
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:05,500
Andrea. Surprised by the speed at which two people

142
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,519
said, "It's not that important." ?

143
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:10,272
It doesn't surprise me that Tai does that.

144
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:13,241
He's so selfless, so caring...

145
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,178
Thank you so much. Oh no, I...

146
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,772
Seriously, you'll eat all the rice you want on camp.

147
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,616
No problem. It's okay with me.

148
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,752
Well, we have our two volunteers.

149
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,220
Brad for Mana

150
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,890
and Tai for Nuku

151
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:28,815
made the last tribal decision,

152
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,725
because it's officially the merger!

153
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,828
Y'all can throw away your bandanas.

154
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,414
Oh my God !

155
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:41,169
Brad and Tai scored symbolic points

156
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,973
by allowing, in a sense, the supply of everyone.

157
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,979
But it makes me suspicious

158
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:50,178
because in this game, everything is calculated.

159
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,705
Brad and Tai,

160
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,684
go to the beach, there is a trunk with two yellow bandanas.

161
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,177
En route!

162
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,079
Thanks guys ! Thanks !

163
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,290
Everyone else: happy feasting!

164
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,995
Oh, my God, cheese!

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,863
This is the best fusion feast!

166
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,223
Of pineapple !

167
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,733
Who wants ham?

168
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,391
I want some ! Am I going to be sick?

169
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:15,762
I have reached fusion,

170
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:18,198
I have to eat, I am a new woman.

171
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,874
And now I'll take out the heavy artillery.

172
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,012
I am ready to act.

173
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,672
I also have the Heir Advantage.

174
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:29,110
But it can only be used when there are 13 or 6 people left in the game.

175
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,954
There we are 13.

176
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,587
But I will do anything

177
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,889
to keep it until the last step.

178
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,538
Too bad for my figure. It was off to a good start.

179
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:39,961
It was starting to get better!

180
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,865
At fusion, everything takes off like a jet plane.

181
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,002
Yes, we are all happy, we eat, we drink,

182
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,937
we have our last meal together,

183
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,905
people are talking,

184
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,432
meet up,

185
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:54,585
we evaluate each other.

186
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,271
Things will take off, heads will roll,

187
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:00,807
so that's where I get stronger.

188
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:02,509
Congratulations to all !

189
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,085
Congratulations to all !

190
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,578
Poor Brad and Tai!

191
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:08,336
Brad is great because he's really starving.

192
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:11,084
I feel guilty. I love you, Brad and Tai!

193
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:12,487
Do not worry !

194
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:14,449
I love you ! We are fine !

195
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,296
My friend !

196
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,733
In football, only the next match counts.

197
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,659
I reached the fusion? Great.

198
00:09:20,784 --> 00:09:22,128
It's in the rear view mirror.

199
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:23,634
I look in front of me.

200
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,308
Who will be the next one ? Not me.

201
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,355
Congratulations on the merger. I am delighted.

202
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,658
Me too. It's a...

203
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:35,150
Tai and I have gotten closer more than once before.

204
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:38,953
I'm taking a bit of the role Caleb had in his season.

205
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,214
I think I can trust him.

206
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,991
And in my old tribe,

207
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,618
Michaela and Hali were at the bottom of the scale.

208
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:47,720
So I want to target them first.

209
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,351
How was it going over there?

210
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,801
What's going on ? You know...

211
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,969
First I have Sierra,

212
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,405
we have Troyzan, so we have lots of people.

213
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,074
But Michaela is a target.

214
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,978
And Hali too, they are immediate targets.

215
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:02,744
At the bottom of the ladder ? Yeah.

216
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,870
Why ?

217
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,639
Because we don't need them. It's a staffing issue.

218
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,541
If you are sure of yourself,

219
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,554
I'm happy, because there are a lot of us there.

220
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,076
We fire them first and then we advise.

221
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:16,658
And then... That's perfect.

222
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,626
I love Brad.

223
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,495
We have a lot in common.

224
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,509
I believe he protects me.

225
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:25,567
I have a majority, I am calm, I am happy.

226
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,335
Twerk ! Twerk ! Twerk !

227
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,167
Twerk ! Twerk ! Twerk !

228
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:31,539
What are they happy about?

229
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,433
I don't know, food.

230
00:10:33,752 --> 00:10:35,059
We do a little dance.

231
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,866
What did you take? You drank ?

232
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,438
Oh yeah. Here, come with me.

233
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,194
Shake with me! Turn around!

234
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:41,949
Come on, everyone!

235
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,184
Oh my God !

236
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,663
Little Debbie went wild, we couldn't stop her.

237
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:48,548
I think alcohol was an excuse

238
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:50,483
for Debbie to let loose.

239
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,093
We'll vomit together.

240
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,668
You have drunken eyes!

241
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:55,822
Oh my God !

242
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,966
It's okay with me

243
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,935
if you think I'm drinking.

244
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,129
But I never drank a drop of alcohol.

245
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:04,739
Debbie, are you drunk?

246
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:07,795
This!

247
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:10,203
Oh my God !

248
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:12,505
I don't... She showed me her ass!

249
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,433
I love you, sweetheart !

250
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:16,618
If I have to fake drunkenness

251
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:20,121
and twerk and shake my body to make them laugh

252
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,048
and make them feel comfortable around me,

253
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,383
I will do it.

254
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,061
I love you all !

255
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,915
No one is going to leave, I love you all!

256
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,400
At this point, 13 is still a lot.

257
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,460
And we don't know where the alliances are.

258
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:37,463
So relationships are important.

259
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,241
Because if you believe that this camp

260
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,869
not going to turn into total chaos, you are stupid.

261
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,725
Welcome !

262
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,122
Well, well! Not naughty!

263
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,216
Just as we left it.

264
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:08,397
Congratulations to all for reaching the fusion!

265
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,472
Congratulations to all !

266
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,241
We're a big family now!

267
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,314
Happy to see you. Me too.

268
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:18,827
I was wrong, sorry. I yelled at you, I freaked out.

269
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:21,501
We're hungry, we're stressed, we're tired... I know, I know.

270
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,194
I am on your side.

271
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:24,486
I say. I know it.

272
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,848
I swallowed my pride and apologized to Brad.

273
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:30,216
For in Exile, Cochran said:

274
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:32,965
"Reach out to everyone."

275
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,712
We reconciled.

276
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,093
I want to be sure

277
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:39,238
that Brad and I are as close as can be

278
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:41,273
in a game of deception and conspiracy.

279
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:43,921
Tell Jeff's story. And Sandra!

280
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,845
I'll tell you about Varner. So.

281
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,374
We come to the council

282
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:50,107
and in less than five minutes,

283
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:52,675
Varner decides to say:

284
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,011
"Zeke is cheating on you.

285
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,296
Because what Zeke doesn't tell you,

286
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:59,746
it's that he's transgender."

287
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:01,910
He said that?!

288
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,231
And that's true. Wait, let him talk.

289
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:08,096
I'm.

290
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,013
Even if it happened in an unhappy way,

291
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:13,301
I think I'm like all of you

292
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,240
changed forever,

293
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,783
changed forever by my experience in Survivor.

294
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:21,521
I am now much stronger, much more capable.

295
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,549
Nice bro. Much better for you.

296
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,610
I was super proud of Zeke. Unbelievable.

297
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:28,882
I have much more respect for him, for telling his story,

298
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,705
that for many of these jokers

299
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,479
I've known for 20 days.

300
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,934
And I think Zeke is right.

301
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,964
Survivor's experience makes you stronger.

302
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:42,067
And nothing will be easy in this fusion.

303
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,822
There are 13 people on this camp.

304
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:48,206
Now the game is to figure out who is where,

305
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:50,204
who is in and who is not.

306
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:53,308
Whatever you want to do, at this point,

307
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:56,682
with you two, Sierra...

308
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:59,251
I have Debbie in my pocket. As we all.

309
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:01,119
For my part,

310
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:02,546
everyone is cool.

311
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:05,524
My main goal is to reconnect

312
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,169
and consolidate ties with the people I was with,

313
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,087
those with whom I have had clashes.

314
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,881
I bonded with Tai.

315
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:14,700
Debbie came back and apologized to me.

316
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:18,470
And with Sierra, Troyzan and me... So far so good.

317
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:20,969
We can do whatever we want at this point.

318
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:24,243
It's Michaela or Hali. It's okay with me.

319
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:26,509
I was thinking: Michaela first.

320
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,939
She could do the tests. Sure.

321
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:30,958
She has always been at the top of my list.

322
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,066
If I think of me and who I can play best with,

323
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:36,300
I don't feel Michaela too much.

324
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:39,124
Its reputation precedes it a little.

325
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:40,885
In the long run, I don't trust her.

326
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,447
So here, I'm bringing everyone together so that we all agree.

327
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:46,119
And Michaela will be the first

328
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:48,229
to sink after melting.

329
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,665
As long as we start with Michaela...

330
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,246
Then we will have control.

331
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:54,398
It's okay with me.

332
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,208
OK. Cool. Let's do that.

333
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,866
Michaela. It's the first ?

334
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,345
I think so.

335
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:02,414
We're going to Michaela.

336
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:04,016
Oh. OK.

337
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:06,209
I believe it's Michaela.

338
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,553
Everyone is leaving.

339
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:11,256
Well, if that's the direction it's going.

340
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,525
There is a consensus, I believe,

341
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,837
to take out Michaela, then Hali.

342
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,231
It will be Michaela first.

343
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,129
100 %.

344
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,268
It's okay with me. Easy.

345
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:26,034
It's pretty.

346
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,180
Maku Maku?

347
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:28,761
I like it. Maku-Maku?

348
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,198
Who are you concerned about?

349
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,508
Michaela ?

350
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,935
I think Ozzy wants to take her out. As we all.

351
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,470
But she must ignore it.

352
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:39,772
Provided she does not gain immunity!

353
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,160
So her first. Wait, she's coming.

354
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,986
Brad and I don't want to work with Michaela.

355
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,288
I find it a bit dodgy.

356
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,291
She's not easy to live with, she's unpredictable,

357
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,018
She is a hit in the tests...

358
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:55,684
She will meddle in every conversation.

359
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,265
She is dangerous on so many levels.

360
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,802
Keeping it in play would harm many of us.

361
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:04,177
It's super easy, if you just...

362
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,732
...sticks to the plan! Yeah, we're sticking to the plan!

363
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:08,009
It's just.

364
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,485
This is Michaela.

365
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,886
Damn, we can't do anything without her showing up.

366
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:14,282
She drives me crazy.

367
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,850
As soon as I talk to someone,

368
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,310
Michaela rapplique,

369
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,011
always lurking around.

370
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:21,019
She doesn't let anyone argue.

371
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,795
Do you have a private conversation?

372
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,484
No. We do our laundry.

373
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:28,350
She's also very abrupt.

374
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:30,198
she lacks tact.

375
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:32,558
What did you tell people about me?

376
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:34,885
That you were very good at the tests.

377
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,740
And we can always read what you think on your face.

378
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,606
I'm always on edge

379
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:47,947
when she is there.

380
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:51,089
You have to take it out by surprise. She must know nothing.

381
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,588
If something sets it in motion,

382
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,456
we're all screwed.

383
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:00,987
There's something on the roof that makes things fall!

384
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,304
What is a hen? But yes !

385
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:05,691
What morons!

386
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,487
Go ahead, talk, it's okay.

387
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,906
You, me, Andrea

388
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,032
and Sara...

389
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,342
It's us four.

390
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,103
Until the end. [???]. I believe you 100%.

391
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:18,346
Genre...

392
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,230
If Michaela is number one, frankly...

393
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:21,507
So that would be...

394
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:22,882
And after ?

395
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,686
We gotta strike before Brad

396
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,580
and Sierra did come out one of us.

397
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:28,706
Just.

398
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,706
Michaela is a potential ally.

399
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,052
So this vote

400
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,388
is much more important than it seems.

401
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,128
There are more or less two natural groups

402
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:42,036
who are vying for the position of power.

403
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,972
It's Cirie, Sarah, Andrea and me

404
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:47,120
against Brad and Sierra's group.

405
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:51,307
And everyone wonders: "Are the others going to strike first?

406
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:53,272
Am I going to get screwed like a rookie?"

407
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:56,519
Well, let's be clear: the hen must come down from the roof.

408
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:58,844
She keeps dropping things on me.

409
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,664
And we have to strike first.

410
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,634
These are the last moments of this simulacrum of cordial agreement.

411
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,327
What is she doing up there? I do not know.

412
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:09,030
It's the smiles before the bloodbath.

413
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:11,230
Eh !

414
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,883
That's why she came up!

415
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:27,006
Who is it ?

416
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:28,714
Andrea.

417
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:34,795
Attractive !

418
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:44,955
We're fixing the bench, because a part is broken.

419
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,969
We need a screwdriver. I say.

420
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,937
During a merger,

421
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,229
it is...

422
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:52,707
There are people everywhere,

423
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,609
conversations in every corner.

424
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,461
It's impossible to track who's talking to whom.

425
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:01,949
Few people work with me at this point.

426
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:06,254
Michaela seems to be on the hot seat.

427
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,223
But I want to work with her. I find her great.

428
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,964
And she would strengthen my ranks.

429
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:14,577
So I gotta shake it up a bit

430
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:17,165
to launch a strategy that could benefit me.

431
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:19,233
Bravo !

432
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,902
I think

433
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,299
that at this stage of the game,

434
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:24,764
we just have to make sure we have the majority on this vote,

435
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:27,480
to know who will vote with you and not against...

436
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:29,623
...toi.

437
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:32,004
Are people trying to vote against me?

438
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,073
I heard your name once.

439
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,418
We can become a target

440
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,793
very quickly here.

441
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,850
My name is already out, and I didn't do anything.

442
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:44,590
And that tends to annoy me.

443
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:46,961
I was about to explode.

444
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:50,552
To be out of the game at this stage of the game is very dangerous.

445
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:53,159
I'll have to find people I can trust

446
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:54,927
to avoid leaving.

447
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:57,238
And it could be Cirie.

448
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:01,593
I heard that my name was being mentioned.

449
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:03,477
It's a good way to piss me off.

450
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,107
You are very smart.

451
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:08,564
You have to control your emotions.

452
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,751
You can't ignore other people's discussions,

453
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:15,174
but you don't have to...

454
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,017
...show nothing.

455
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,899
I wanted to take you aside

456
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:22,465
between women,

457
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,694
to tell you to calm down about it.

458
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:27,248
Whatever's going on in your head, if you're hungry,

459
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:28,605
starve yourself.

460
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,875
If you're pissed off, get pissed off.

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,999
I have to work on this. Yes. I experienced that.

462
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,644
Michaela is on edge.

463
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,197
I was like that.

464
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:41,342
When I was his age,

465
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,463
I was a hothead like her.

466
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,413
I thought I knew...

467
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:48,956
I thought I knew everything. But I learned

468
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,959
that being on the defensive pushes people away.

469
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,370
And in such a game, you have to attract as many people as possible,

470
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:59,044
not push them away or make them feel uncomfortable.

471
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:04,238
You know, I don't know how to handle this merger.

472
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,069
It's new for me.

473
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,167
Go cool. Let me tell you something.

474
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,088
You have to let go

475
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:13,021
and be as normal as possible.

476
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,386
Because if you generate any tension...

477
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:18,007
It doesn't take much here to attract attention.

478
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:20,703
You learn that in this game: your reputation follows you.

479
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,248
And people's perception is their reality.

480
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:26,317
No matter what it really is, reality...

481
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:29,021
That's what they think. So. This is reality for them.

482
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:31,223
Cirie and I had

483
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:33,308
a real heart-to-heart discussion.

484
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,603
Because we have a lot in common.

485
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:39,040
My confidence in Cirie skyrocketed.

486
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,575
I'm very excited to play with her.

487
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,305
I don't believe that two black women have already reached the final.

488
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,431
No never.

489
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,830
You may have guessed it from my aura, I [???],

490
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:53,441
I want to show people that we can work together.

491
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:56,757
For now, Michaela is public enemy number one.

492
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,834
But I really appreciate it.

493
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,594
And as a human being,

494
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,564
as an eldest

495
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,337
vis-à-vis a younger one, we want to save her,

496
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:08,225
and if I succeed,

497
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,639
I can count on her to support me.

498
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,239
Over here, everyone!

499
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:32,041
Ready for your first individual immunity test?

500
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:34,053
First of all, Ozzy...

501
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:36,282
I'm taking back tribal immunity.

502
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:37,498
Merci.

503
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:41,769
Tribal immunity is over.

504
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,571
Let's see.

505
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,431
Individual immunity is what you covet.

506
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:50,945
Attractive. Funny face.

507
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:54,081
With that around your neck, you're safe.

508
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,808
Without, you are not.

509
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,686
Shall we pass the test?

510
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:00,755
Today,

511
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,057
you'll be on tiptoe

512
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,494
with a block wedged between your head and the frame.

513
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:08,629
The longer the ordeal lasts,

514
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,998
the more your legs will tire.

515
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,425
When they finally let go, the block will fall

516
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:15,111
and it will be over.

517
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,906
The last person standing wins immunity,

518
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,775
is shielded from the board.

519
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,911
The losers: someone will be the eighth person

520
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,646
eliminated from the game.

521
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:28,140
We draw the places at random and we start.

522
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:34,046
Good.

523
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,790
Place the block above you.

524
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:37,491
I will count.

525
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,361
Three,

526
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:42,129
of them,

527
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,255
and...

528
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,900
Well, take all your hands off!

529
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,638
Everyone looks good.

530
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,841
This test is on.

531
00:23:57,405 --> 00:24:00,361
It's very simple: no touching the frame...

532
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,251
Hali is eliminated in seconds. And Troyzan.

533
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:06,481
Et Zeke.

534
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:07,913
You are only ten.

535
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:11,459
Three people eliminated in three seconds.

536
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:13,848
Shame.

537
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,456
I was saying...

538
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:21,399
No touching the frame or the block.

539
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:23,070
Relax.

540
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,528
It will be painful, instantly.

541
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:27,566
I'm already shaking. That's crazy.

542
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:29,656
Fight the pain.

543
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:31,637
Ouch. Style is secondary.

544
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:35,841
Cirie is eliminated.

545
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:37,618
She felt him slip.

546
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:40,746
In this ordeal, you cannot pitch.

547
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:43,159
Hold on. Hold on.

548
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:45,593
Michaela chants, talking to herself.

549
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,019
Do what it takes.

550
00:24:47,144 --> 00:24:47,953
Relax.

551
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,865
Michaela falters.

552
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,382
Incredible recovery.

553
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:54,602
His block really took off,

554
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,505
but did not fall, she picked herself up.

555
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,942
Debbie can't take it anymore.

556
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,226
Debbie is eliminated.

557
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,446
You are only eight.

558
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:09,183
Hold on. Hold on.

559
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,476
Michaela struggles.

560
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:14,413
Its block evolves slowly towards the back of the frame.

561
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,358
Michaela is right on the edge.

562
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:20,127
Michaela is eliminated.

563
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:22,529
Take a seat on the bench.

564
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,000
You are already only seven.

565
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,227
Six fell quickly.

566
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,163
The remaining seven look good.

567
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,376
Only five minutes have passed.

568
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,578
It could easily take an hour.

569
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:39,713
We're going to tan a little.

570
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,017
That is to say if you will have to suffer to win.

571
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:45,444
Ozzy does a little dance,

572
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:47,750
attempts to stimulate blood circulation,

573
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,323
to stretch the muscles.

574
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,426
Ozzy,

575
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,561
without warning,

576
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:54,479
falls.

577
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:55,654
Ozzy is eliminated.

578
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,890
Aubry falters.

579
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,434
Aubry

580
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,102
falls without warning.

581
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,671
And you are only five.

582
00:26:05,394 --> 00:26:07,408
You are going to deserve it, this immunity.

583
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,857
This first board after the merger

584
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,581
is such a dangerous step.

585
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,416
It's certain.

586
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:18,652
Everyone is together, nobody really knows

587
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,045
Where is the truth.

588
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:21,547
It's certain.

589
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:26,852
Culpepper lutte.

590
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,190
Culpepper is eliminated.

591
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:34,159
And you are only four.

592
00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:37,317
First individual immunity test

593
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:40,097
with a big tip in perspective.

594
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:53,087
25 minutes have passed.

595
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,924
Several people did not last 25 seconds.

596
00:26:57,174 --> 00:26:59,158
Three women, one man.

597
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,787
Never has a woman won this test.

598
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:09,370
Sierra goes through many small spasms.

599
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:11,900
Unbalanced, she pulls herself together.

600
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,413
Sarah suddenly loses her block, and there are only three of you.

601
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:22,850
And suddenly,

602
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,209
Sierra is eliminated.

603
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:26,478
Very hard legs.

604
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:28,756
And you are only two.

605
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:32,960
Or you don't Andrea.

606
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,498
Andrea ate at the Fusion Feast.

607
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:36,624
Tai, don't.

608
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:38,724
Will it make the difference?

609
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:40,000
They clash

610
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,703
in the 34th season of Survivor.

611
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,706
Tai didn't move.

612
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:48,790
Andrea falters.

613
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,636
It is very painful.

614
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:51,603
Really.

615
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:54,748
That's Survivor.

616
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:56,817
Who wants her the most?

617
00:27:58,774 --> 00:27:59,775
It's...

618
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:01,446
...falls suddenly!

619
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:02,921
Tai is eliminated!

620
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:05,325
Andrea gagne

621
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,594
the first individual immunity!

622
00:28:07,976 --> 00:28:11,055
You rock. 1st woman to win this event!

623
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,402
You're great.

624
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:15,961
Andrea, come here!

625
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:23,028
The first person to wear this necklace.

626
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:25,096
Individual immunity is up to you.

627
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:27,081
You're safe at tonight's council.

628
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,029
You cannot be eliminated from the game.

629
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:31,070
As for you guys, you know the song.

630
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:33,087
21 days is not enough.

631
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,500
Someone will see their dream fade away

632
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,760
and will become the eighth person eliminated from Game Changers.

633
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,929
Take your things. See you tonight at the council.

634
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,254
Congratulation.

635
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:46,558
Tonight's vote seems very simple.

636
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:48,697
But that's Survivor Game Changers.

637
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:51,230
No vote is easy. Everyone has hidden motivations.

638
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:55,006
The challenge of this advice is to take control of the game.

639
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,677
Congratulations, Andrea! Cheer !

640
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,112
Merci !

641
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:09,191
How long could you have lasted?

642
00:29:09,316 --> 00:29:11,888
The key is to maintain strong pressure.

643
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,228
At this point, I think I hold the reins.

644
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,197
I love having control.

645
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:20,634
From my point of view, there is this large group,

646
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,270
and two underdogs, Hali and Michaela.

647
00:29:23,756 --> 00:29:26,098
I think eliminating Michaela tonight is best.

648
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:29,977
But I dread seeing an idol come out.

649
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,473
I have already played with Hali.

650
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:33,690
This time around, she's absurdly confident.

651
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,504
She plays quite differently.

652
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:37,534
I think she has an idol.

653
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:39,586
Someone has the one from the old Nuku beach.

654
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,712
I do not know.

655
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:44,644
But that's my feeling. If that's okay with you, we'll split the votes.

656
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:46,092
The majority on Michaela.

657
00:29:46,977 --> 00:29:48,520
Seeing how Hali plays

658
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:50,167
compared to his first time,

659
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:51,990
she plays completely differently.

660
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:56,236
And that makes me think she might have an idol.

661
00:29:58,682 --> 00:30:00,132
I think she has an idol.

662
00:30:02,282 --> 00:30:03,702
I think so.

663
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:04,828
But it is okay.

664
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:06,246
It does not matter.

665
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:09,543
There, we have such a majority

666
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:12,344
which can be divided between the two, whenever there is an idol.

667
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,384
What's up, ladies?

668
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:16,819
We can talk quickly.

669
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:18,650
Yeah, because I don't know what's going on.

670
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,354
Four people will vote Hali.

671
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:25,732
Everyone else votes Michaela.

672
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:28,435
So... Michaela is leaving tonight.

673
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:30,529
Do you think Hali has an idol?

674
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,266
Who are we telling them we're voting for?

675
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:35,767
We stay on Zeke?

676
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:37,077
Oui.

677
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,221
So we tell them we're voting for Zeke?

678
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:40,347
Oui.

679
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:44,384
I have no idea what is going on.

680
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,744
I am dropped.

681
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:47,954
We think of Zeke.

682
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,461
Because if he goes to the end, he will win.

683
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:53,245
He clearly has the best story.

684
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,096
Everyone says "Zeke".

685
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,178
So I'm going to vote Zeke.

686
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,133
'Cause what else can I do?

687
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,335
But I'm not comfortable.

688
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,963
What do you say ? You're hesitating ?

689
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:06,173
I do not care.

690
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,259
I just feel like my name is going to come out, I don't know why.

691
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:18,185
This vote for Michaela, I don't particularly like it.

692
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,610
Is it good for my game?

693
00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:23,924
Why would I follow their plan? Because Sierra said so?

694
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:27,894
Since there are two options, Michaela or Hali...

695
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:30,055
Why not Hali?

696
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:33,416
What's new ?

697
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:36,894
The vote is supposed to be Michaela, then Hali, right?

698
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:38,630
For all I know.

699
00:31:38,755 --> 00:31:40,786
My only concern,

700
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:42,509
is that if they want Michaela,

701
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,642
it is to be able to join Hali.

702
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,204
So if we do that,

703
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:48,086
we play their game.

704
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:50,963
I thought we were worried that Hali had an idol.

705
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:54,546
That's what they say, but I don't know.

706
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:57,048
I just know that they will strengthen their ranks.

707
00:31:57,173 --> 00:31:59,939
And if they do that, what happens to us?

708
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,753
It's certain.

709
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:07,608
Tonight is the outbreak of hostilities between two alliances.

710
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:10,291
And I think everyone sees Michaela and Hali

711
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,951
as potential recruits.

712
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:16,877
So this vote is to reduce the opposing ranks.

713
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:21,089
See if they try to convince you to vote Michaela and not Hali.

714
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:22,850
I bet they will.

715
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:27,020
But I don't see the point, except for their side.

716
00:32:30,226 --> 00:32:31,312
I have a question.

717
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:34,352
I've just been told how the vote is going.

718
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:38,257
I'm puzzled: why not target Hali?

719
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:39,815
Why don't we do it?

720
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,852
For me, if she has an idol,

721
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:43,647
but don't play it

722
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:46,812
then she remains in play with an idol.

723
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:48,422
It's decided like that.

724
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:50,423
If we keep Michaela,

725
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:52,219
it will sow chaos.

726
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:53,566
It will be horror.

727
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,540
But we will release it two days later!

728
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:58,486
But hey, if it bothers you that much...

729
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,421
No, that just seems a little absurd to me.

730
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,022
We can do one or the other.

731
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,534
We are many. We must remain calm.

732
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:07,568
Both positions defend themselves.

733
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:09,387
That's the thing.

734
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:11,331
We can't win the war

735
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:13,719
without a sufficient army.

736
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:15,335
And if Michaela leaves,

737
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,771
it's one less person I can count on.

738
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,239
What is his problem ?

739
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,200
Is that he... ...wants to be in charge?

740
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,378
Well, guess what?

741
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:26,945
There's a new sheriff in town.

742
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:34,817
Listen, my daughter. I'm trying to save your life here.

743
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:36,281
They lie about Zeke.

744
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,538
I am in the hot seat.

745
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:42,128
But I don't want to explode.

746
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:44,923
Because that won't help me.

747
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:47,615
I'm super happy to have Cirie.

748
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,736
My life is completely in his hands.

749
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,006
And I trust.

750
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,498
That's why I like to play with people I trust.

751
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,443
We're trying to save you.

752
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:57,122
You can't tell anyone about it.

753
00:33:57,694 --> 00:33:59,699
You hear me ? Nothing.

754
00:33:59,824 --> 00:34:01,485
Everyone is on edge.

755
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,112
Everyone watches everyone.

756
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,620
So I need Michaela to vote Zeke,

757
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,432
she follows the plan.

758
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,415
So no one knows it was Cirie who changed the plan.

759
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,184
I will not tell anything. To no one.

760
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:14,719
Just tell me how to vote.

761
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,875
Stay on Zeke, okay?

762
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,627
OK. Thanks.

763
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,205
For me, the purpose of this advice

764
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,576
is to save someone I can rely on

765
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,519
and who can strengthen our ranks.

766
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:33,204
And if I succeed in this,

767
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:36,616
my future in this game looks bright.

768
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:56,603
Cirie, the last person to come to the council.

769
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,238
There is a torch for you.

770
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,040
Take it, turn it on.

771
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:05,637
It is part of the council ritual,

772
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:06,980
because in this game,

773
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,485
fire represents your life.

774
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,151
If he disappears

775
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,409
you too.

776
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:14,888
13 people.

777
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,014
Zeke.

778
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:18,391
The game goes from two tribes

779
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,878
to this mass of individuals.

780
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:23,196
How significant is this change

781
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,490
in how you should view the game?

782
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:27,000
This is madness, Jeff.

783
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,195
There are so many people to watch, and so many people you can't watch.

784
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,374
You have to accept that a lot of things are going to happen around you

785
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,452
and that you are powerless to control them.

786
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:38,797
Andrea. If you had to explain the merger

787
00:35:38,922 --> 00:35:40,955
to someone who has never seen Survivor,

788
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,140
what would you say ?

789
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,185
It's the moment of the game where...?

790
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,288
This is when the battle lines are set.

791
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:51,550
The two votes following the merger are crucial.

792
00:35:51,675 --> 00:35:54,160
They will show where the alliances are.

793
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,120
It sets the tone for the rest of the game.

794
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:59,867
Debbie. Is it a bit like musical chairs?

795
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,927
Turn and wait for the music to stop to take a seat?

796
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,004
Not tonight, no.

797
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,131
I don't expect to be shocked tonight.

798
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,977
Hali, when you hear Debbie say that,

799
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,113
does that reassure you?

800
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,814
"That's what I think too." ?

801
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,884
Or are you worried because it's new to you?

802
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,553
I am in the dark on this vote.

803
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,989
It's like being in a room

804
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,225
with armed people

805
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,761
and 3 or 4 of us are blindfolded.

806
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,200
One of us is going to be shot.

807
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:31,831
I don't know who.

808
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,359
Michaela.

809
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,633
You nod. Do you agree with Hali?

810
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:40,240
Yeah. Basically, no one tried to talk to me today.

811
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,699
So you are worried.

812
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,867
Sure.

813
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:47,147
But if people really played an individual game,

814
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,983
they would consider the various existing links,

815
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:52,085
would look at who threatens them,

816
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,754
who plays the most strategically,

817
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,804
and who finds himself by chance in the hot seat

818
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:00,285
without valid reason.

819
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:03,889
I'm trying to understand what motivates people to vote,

820
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,097
but I feel like Hali, a bit in the dark.

821
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,426
This.

822
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:12,105
How to determine who to vote for tonight

823
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,399
when there are so many people,

824
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,360
and yet, as Andrea said,

825
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,279
Could it be a deciding vote?

826
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:23,049
It should not be considered that tonight's vote,

827
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:28,286
but also the following two or three.

828
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:30,790
Ozzy. At some stage,

829
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,185
a name must be advanced. "Why not so and so?"

830
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,662
From your point of view,

831
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,330
what is the criteria?

832
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,090
The risk.

833
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:42,602
Also, the possibility of an idol being played.

834
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:45,905
And if possible, guide the vote

835
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,633
towards the person who might have an idol.

836
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,578
These are big questions in this game.

837
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,647
Debbie. Has it been discussed a lot, idols?

838
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,816
If anyone has one or not,

839
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,651
and if so, should it be targeted?

840
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,821
I love the board, it's the quintessence of the game.

841
00:38:02,277 --> 00:38:04,224
It's the Colosseum.

842
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,784
Here you live or you die.

843
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:09,796
Tonight, I always find it exciting,

844
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:11,422
but I think

845
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:13,199
that now, this moment,

846
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:15,869
it's always a good time to clear an idol.

847
00:38:16,954 --> 00:38:17,955
Cirie.

848
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,298
Are there ever people who say, "Listen,

849
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,909
I'll undress, search my bag,

850
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,569
I'll go naked to the council,

851
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:25,948
I don't have an idol."

852
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:28,554
The person suspected of having an idol

853
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:31,275
may not know she is

854
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,588
and therefore not being able to say: "Here are my pockets, I don't have it!"

855
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:39,375
If you think a person has an idol, you don't:

856
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,006
"Hey, I think you have an idol!"

857
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:44,088
Eh !

858
00:38:45,102 --> 00:38:46,691
If this is the time to do this,

859
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:48,888
I want to empty my bag.

860
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,411
Hali, you're afraid you're the one

861
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,914
suspected of having an idol, hence your blindfolded eyes.

862
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,050
If so, let me know if it's necessary!

863
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:08,051
I just want to die another day, not today.

864
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:10,684
Zeke. Why not accept such an offer?

865
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,283
This is additional information.

866
00:39:12,408 --> 00:39:14,566
I don't think anyone wants to be the one who says:

867
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:16,529
"Yes, go ahead, Hali!

868
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,864
Vide ton sac !"

869
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,292
If you want more security, show a little courage.

870
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:25,238
Tell me, can we do a bag search

871
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,107
to sort things out, if that's what it takes.

872
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:32,045
But I will only do it if asked.

873
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:35,280
Aubrey. Light my lantern.

874
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,150
Why would Hali say:

875
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:40,853
"I'm ready to empty my bag, to show that I have no idol,

876
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,562
but not if no one is willing to ask me."?

877
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:47,218
It's the sign of a good player.

878
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,717
We can claim to want to be as frank and clear as possible,

879
00:39:50,842 --> 00:39:53,533
but there is always a part of mystery in this game

880
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,159
and everything can change in an instant.

881
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:59,706
I would invite people to consider those who are blindfolded.

882
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,200
Aren't they the weakest in the game?

883
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:04,413
Are they really the game changers?

884
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:07,411
Is this the minority?

885
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:11,150
Sierra. Hali says, "If you target me,

886
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,810
you are making a huge mistake.

887
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:14,854
Pick a real target, not me."

888
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,490
Yes, that clearly makes sense.

889
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:20,485
Free electrons are crucial, they define majorities.

890
00:40:20,937 --> 00:40:25,198
But there is a moment to muster a majority.

891
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:26,499
Is it now?

892
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,474
Is this the start of the game? You don't know.

893
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,066
Good. It's time to vote.

894
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:36,843
Troyzan, over to you.

895
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:02,689
It's to save your life and mine.

896
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:05,449
Hopefully it brings us longevity in this game.

897
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:07,324
It's meaningless.

898
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,525
I will count the votes.

899
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:34,595
If anyone has an immunity idol and wants to play it,

900
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,427
now is the time to do it.

901
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,004
Good. Once the votes have been read, the decision is final.

902
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:46,145
The eliminated person will leave the board immediately.

903
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,572
I will read the votes.

904
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,550
Premier vote :

905
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:52,656
Zeke.

906
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,679
Zeke.

907
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,255
Two votes Zeke.

908
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,649
Michaela.

909
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,453
Status.

910
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:05,932
Michaela.

911
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:10,061
Even. Two votes Zeke,

912
00:42:10,186 --> 00:42:11,963
two votes Michaela, two votes Hali.

913
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,774
That's three votes Michaela.

914
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:20,238
Halli. Three Hali votes.

915
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,443
Michaela. Four votes Michaela.

916
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,290
Halli. Four Hali votes,

917
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,910
four votes Michaela,

918
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:34,627
two votes Zeke.

919
00:42:38,026 --> 00:42:40,433
Halli. That's five Hali votes.

920
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,340
Eighth person eliminated and first member of the jury...

921
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:50,549
Halli. That's six, that's enough. Bring me your torch.

922
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,688
Hali, the tribe has spoken.

923
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:06,284
It's time to go.

924
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:08,586
I enjoyed getting to know each of you.

925
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,596
May the best win !

926
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,030
With this vote,

927
00:43:19,155 --> 00:43:21,274
we have the first member of the jury.

928
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:24,677
Which means that now every vote

929
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,779
becomes part of your CV

930
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,681
in case you reach the final.

931
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,717
Take your torches, return to camp.

932
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:32,151
Good night.

933
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:35,230
I just feel like they're stupid.

934
00:43:35,355 --> 00:43:37,329
Why did you eliminate me?

935
00:43:37,454 --> 00:43:41,174
Do you want to face the strong and the strategists?

936
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:43,444
Or a bunch of puppets?

937
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:46,663
I'm happy to be a juror, to still be part of the game.

938
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:48,835
I don't know what mistake I made,

939
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,790
but whatever the reason for my departure,

940
00:43:50,915 --> 00:43:52,972
they are still in play, so kudos to them.

941
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,216
Michaela, how did you sleep?

942
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:15,219
Perfectly well.

943
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:17,242
The most peaceful of sleeps.

944
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:20,733
Cirie put herself in danger for me on the council,

945
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:22,947
and I will do the same for her

946
00:44:23,072 --> 00:44:25,229
if I have the chance.

947
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:29,181
I can't guarantee we stay in the game

948
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:32,664
that if you don't tell anyone about my role in this

949
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:34,247
or our discussions.

950
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,964
You should be able to trust me here.

951
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:38,307
I told you what would happen. I believe in you.

952
00:44:38,432 --> 00:44:41,041
And I did everything in this direction. Here's Brad.

953
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:43,623
For someone of my origin,

954
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:45,297
a black american,

955
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:48,407
be able to play with another black American,

956
00:44:48,532 --> 00:44:52,131
there is a level of spontaneous confidence.

957
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:54,740
So for now, I leave it to her.

958
00:44:54,865 --> 00:44:58,437
She understands the different dynamics better than I do.

959
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:02,074
Above all, I don't want to harm her when she helped me.

960
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:08,205
What is being said?

961
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,380
You must know more than me.

962
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,893
Right now, you're the one informing me.

963
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:15,469
On the board, I voted for Michaela,

964
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:18,126
and Michaela for Zeke,

965
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:20,073
according to plan.

966
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,864
But I have my own ideas and I want to play my game.

967
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:29,227
So on the next tip, the dragon will be unleashed.

968
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,772
Everything will be revealed and the war will begin.

969
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:35,808
But hey... Brad and Sierra are united.

970
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,962
I don't even think we need them.

971
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:39,879
I know where I stand vis-à-vis them.

972
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:42,038
If we're going for Brad or Sierra, then...

973
00:45:42,683 --> 00:45:44,933
We can go directly to the vote.

974
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:48,303
Sierra and Brad, as I see them,

975
00:45:48,428 --> 00:45:49,997
Sierra is like the godfather.

976
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,627
She controls Brad

977
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:55,029
who controls Troyzan.

978
00:45:55,154 --> 00:45:56,698
It's like a chain.

979
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:59,491
If we remove the first link,

980
00:45:59,616 --> 00:46:01,634
the chain will be destroyed.

981
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,237
She could therefore be in the hot seat.

982
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,106
If we want to release Brad or Sierra,

983
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,843
I doubt anyone will object.

984
00:46:12,398 --> 00:46:13,704
Zeke agrees.

985
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:15,348
Andrea is in.

986
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,750
I trust Agent Sarah,

987
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,644
and I know Michaela will follow. We are ready for war.

988
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:25,424
Armed to the teeth!

989
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:29,387
There are four people I'm sure of.

990
00:46:29,512 --> 00:46:32,493
Zeke, moi, Andrea, Sarah.

991
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,905
Five with you.

992
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,436
Six with Michaela.

993
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:37,928
And seven with Ozzy.

994
00:46:38,053 --> 00:46:40,866
I feel like I'm in the middle

995
00:46:40,991 --> 00:46:43,941
of a fight in a large Italian family.

996
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,179
There are two camps and Cirie

997
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,505
is the black Italian grandmother.

998
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,118
Or the aunt. More like an aunt.

999
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,401
And if I gotta be in Cirie's band,

1000
00:46:54,526 --> 00:46:55,921
it's okay with me.

1001
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:03,339
Just... Sorry.

1002
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:05,196
Its good.

1003
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:08,934
I wanted to talk to you long term.

1004
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,562
It suits me that we are not fixed on the last five,

1005
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:14,064
because we already have to get there,

1006
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:17,751
but Sierra is eyeing around here, we're making her super nervous.

1007
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:21,380
I'm dying to get Brad or Sierra out.

1008
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,555
I'm starting to gather a majority

1009
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,336
to gently take over,

1010
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:27,778
which would be ideal.

1011
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:29,413
Sierra and Brad,

1012
00:47:29,538 --> 00:47:30,790
we make them nervous.

1013
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:34,560
And reciprocally.

1014
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,686
Exactly.

1015
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,190
But I don't think we can tell Debbie

1016
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:40,782
or in Tai.

1017
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:42,894
Debbie is going all out right now.

1018
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:45,071
And she really likes Sierra.

1019
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,702
Let's keep her out of it.

1020
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:49,217
If you argue, I don't want... No, no!

1021
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:50,634
We are resting.

1022
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:52,224
In general, I have control.

1023
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:54,505
But I don't see it quite clearly, so far.

1024
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,550
'Cause most of my info comes from Cirie

1025
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,910
and Andrea. They are the ones in control.

1026
00:48:00,035 --> 00:48:01,253
Something is wrong.

1027
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,480
I do not occupy the position that I would like.

1028
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,313
Debbie is not with us. I do not know.

1029
00:48:07,438 --> 00:48:10,509
Finally, yes, but it is unpredictable,

1030
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:13,632
she will do whatever comes into her head.

1031
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,401
The last time I played

1032
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,761
I may have taken action too soon.

1033
00:48:17,886 --> 00:48:20,038
But if you have to have regrets,

1034
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,866
is it better to regret having acted too quickly

1035
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:25,978
or of not seizing an opportunity to act?

1036
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,458
Better to regret having acted.

1037
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:29,707
This is...

1038
00:48:30,183 --> 00:48:31,750
You have to play.

1039
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:32,876
On sort Sierra.

1040
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:34,442
Then Debbie.

1041
00:48:35,572 --> 00:48:37,323
It'll work, because she's shady.

1042
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:40,420
That's why we shouldn't tell him about the vote against Sierra.

1043
00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:43,148
There will be enough of us to take it out then.

1044
00:48:43,939 --> 00:48:45,364
To be honest,

1045
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,689
Brad and Sierra

1046
00:48:47,522 --> 00:48:49,106
are more or less dangerous,

1047
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:50,728
but not that much.

1048
00:48:50,853 --> 00:48:53,072
But I see Cirie

1049
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:54,213
and Andrea

1050
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:57,409
as far more strategically dangerous than Sierra.

1051
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,573
They try to control the game.

1052
00:48:59,698 --> 00:49:02,214
Then I could take out Cirie or Andrea.

1053
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,583
To this vote, right now.

1054
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,158
Why wait ?

1055
00:49:19,405 --> 00:49:20,699
Over here, everyone!

1056
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,671
Ready for today's reward event?

1057
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,582
Today you will be divided

1058
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,184
into two teams of six.

1059
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,651
At my signal,

1060
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,687
two members of each team will swim

1061
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,356
to retrieve a net filled with wooden fish.

1062
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,991
You will bring it back to earth.

1063
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:49,086
There, two other crew members will untie the fish,

1064
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:51,688
hook them to a pole and bring them to the finish.

1065
00:49:51,813 --> 00:49:53,585
There, the last two team members

1066
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,864
solve a puzzle with the fish.

1067
00:49:58,794 --> 00:50:01,206
The first team to do so wins the reward.

1068
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,488
Want to know what's at stake? Yeah !

1069
00:50:03,613 --> 00:50:05,243
A day...

1070
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:06,904
luxury.

1071
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:08,639
Oh my God !

1072
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:13,252
The winning team will leave for the lounge "Marshalls"

1073
00:50:13,775 --> 00:50:16,188
where you will enjoy a shower...

1074
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,482
A shower ! ...with soaps and shampoos.

1075
00:50:19,242 --> 00:50:20,450
You will dry yourself

1076
00:50:20,575 --> 00:50:22,961
with Egyptian cotton towels.

1077
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,021
Enough, Jeff!

1078
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,800
You will relax in soft branded bathrobes

1079
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,269
and pamper yourself with lotions.

1080
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,638
And when you're clean,

1081
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,064
a little more comfort

1082
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:36,475
in the form of burgers.

1083
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,546
Apple pie.

1084
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,080
Apple pie !

1085
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,307
It's worth it ?

1086
00:50:44,228 --> 00:50:47,085
We form the teams like a schoolyard and we go.

1087
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,336
Let's go.

1088
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:49,613
Oh my God !

1089
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:55,727
Well, we have our two teams.

1090
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,162
Sarah was captain.

1091
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,864
She chose Culpepper,

1092
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,366
Aubry, Michaela,

1093
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,534
Cirie and Sierra.

1094
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,027
Andrea was captain.

1095
00:51:04,152 --> 00:51:05,371
She chose Tai,

1096
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:07,339
Ozzy, Troyzan,

1097
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,341
Debbie and Zeke.

1098
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,366
Here we go, for the reward.

1099
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,384
A day of luxury.

1100
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:15,047
Survivors, ready?

1101
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,366
Go !

1102
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:23,255
It's Sarah and Culpepper for the Oranges,

1103
00:51:23,768 --> 00:51:25,994
Troyzan and Ozzy for the Blues.

1104
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,618
Troyzan takes care of the knots out of the water

1105
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:30,395
while Ozzy dives.

1106
00:51:33,182 --> 00:51:36,168
Both Culpepper and Sarah are underwater.

1107
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:40,772
Once detached,

1108
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,499
start bringing in those fish!

1109
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:46,392
Culpepper undid his knots out of the water.

1110
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,562
Ozzy stayed underwater for a long time for the Blues.

1111
00:51:54,447 --> 00:51:55,778
Sarah et Culpepper

1112
00:51:55,903 --> 00:51:57,247
released their fish.

1113
00:51:57,372 --> 00:51:58,348
Good !

1114
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:02,720
Troyzan and Ozzy are still struggling with the last knots.

1115
00:52:05,947 --> 00:52:08,066
There is a fish in the water.

1116
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,401
Sarah, the fish! Go and get it !

1117
00:52:10,526 --> 00:52:11,904
Go get the fish!

1118
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:13,922
Sarah and Culpepper, we have to get it back!

1119
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,166
Go-y, Sarah!

1120
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:17,084
Sarah swims towards the fish.

1121
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:20,701
This allows Ozzy and Troyzan to return.

1122
00:52:20,826 --> 00:52:22,814
Come on, guys, keep going!

1123
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:27,986
Culpepper now has to pull this very heavy net all by himself.

1124
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:31,114
Troyzan and Ozzy close the gap.

1125
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:32,669
Well done, Troy and Ozzy!

1126
00:52:32,794 --> 00:52:34,660
Great ! It's good !

1127
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:37,179
The Blues now lead.

1128
00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:39,831
Biggest reward of the season.

1129
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:41,867
Both teams

1130
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,769
are clearly motivated.

1131
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,919
Ozzy and Troy carry it and walk now.

1132
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:49,032
You have to put it on the mat.

1133
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,468
Go for it !

1134
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,314
Now Andrea and Tai untie the fish from the Blues.

1135
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:57,549
This is Culpepper and Sarah,

1136
00:52:58,035 --> 00:52:59,618
just behind.

1137
00:53:00,168 --> 00:53:03,476
We see the weight of these parts.

1138
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:05,257
Drop it, it's good!

1139
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:07,701
Sarah and Culpepper, it's over.

1140
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:09,561
Aubry and Michaela's turn.

1141
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:11,899
It's very tight.

1142
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:14,433
Tai continues to untie,

1143
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,211
Andrea hooks the fish.

1144
00:53:16,336 --> 00:53:17,534
Good Andrea!

1145
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:20,806
There are 14 fish. They must be placed on all the hooks

1146
00:53:22,023 --> 00:53:24,520
then transport them to the "puzzle" station.

1147
00:53:24,645 --> 00:53:27,012
Michaela hooks the fish for the Oranges

1148
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,947
while Aubry unties the knots.

1149
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,117
There should be 14, two per hook.

1150
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,368
To the right !

1151
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:34,611
Ready? Go!

1152
00:53:35,563 --> 00:53:36,722
On court, on court !

1153
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,590
Andrea and Tai take off.

1154
00:53:39,118 --> 00:53:40,383
You are missing one!

1155
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,060
Hey, come back!

1156
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,187
Come on, you're missing one!

1157
00:53:44,784 --> 00:53:45,785
Tai, don't!

1158
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,170
Come on Tai!

1159
00:53:47,295 --> 00:53:48,600
Go back!

1160
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,293
New setback for the Blues!

1161
00:53:51,038 --> 00:53:52,237
Andrea and Tai

1162
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,460
lost time without having all the parts.

1163
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:56,651
An opportunity for Michaela and Aubry,

1164
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:58,542
who have all the parts.

1165
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:00,545
They regain their heads.

1166
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,798
Huge mistake by Tai and Andrea.

1167
00:54:03,923 --> 00:54:05,550
And we can see it,

1168
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,375
at this very moment, exhaustion is setting in.

1169
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,555
Its good !

1170
00:54:11,176 --> 00:54:13,358
Now, Sierra and Cirie

1171
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,694
attack the puzzle for the Oranges.

1172
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,059
Tai and Andrea thought they were well organized.

1173
00:54:18,184 --> 00:54:19,890
They went too fast.

1174
00:54:20,015 --> 00:54:22,759
It wasted a lot of their time.

1175
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,162
Now they have to carry this pole,

1176
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:27,598
again, until the finish.

1177
00:54:29,524 --> 00:54:33,045
Cirie and Sierra have already attacked the puzzle.

1178
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:37,361
Zeke and Debbie must land all the coins

1179
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:39,009
before you can start.

1180
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:41,053
It's kind of a head start

1181
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:42,754
which can make you win.

1182
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,757
The Blues had a huge lead

1183
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,166
and lost it.

1184
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:50,896
Zeke and Debbie will have to make up time on the puzzle.

1185
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,989
The "Marshalls" lounge for the winners.

1186
00:54:53,114 --> 00:54:56,034
A hot afternoon in camp for the losers.

1187
00:54:56,284 --> 00:54:59,037
You solve two puzzles side by side.

1188
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:01,774
Both must be fair.

1189
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,824
As with any good Survivor puzzle,

1190
00:55:03,949 --> 00:55:07,746
you won't know until the very end if it's right.

1191
00:55:08,444 --> 00:55:11,383
Cirie and Sierra finished a puzzle.

1192
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:12,851
If that's right!

1193
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,786
Debbie and Zeke attempt to climb back up.

1194
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,523
Cirie and Sierra are starting to struggle

1195
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,047
with their second puzzle.

1196
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:23,895
It doesn't work nearly as well as the first one.

1197
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,297
Wait, here, Debbie.

1198
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,923
Zeke thinks he's got something.

1199
00:55:27,048 --> 00:55:29,210
Zeke and Debbie move very quickly.

1200
00:55:29,335 --> 00:55:32,385
It would be quite a comeback if they were successful.

1201
00:55:34,086 --> 00:55:36,132
Cirie and Sierra think they're on the right track.

1202
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,588
Not, there, there! Celui-ci!

1203
00:55:39,713 --> 00:55:41,413
Zeke thinks he found it.

1204
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,970
It will be played on the wire.

1205
00:55:44,095 --> 00:55:45,344
Who will finish first?

1206
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:47,352
Hurry up ! We hurry!

1207
00:55:52,314 --> 00:55:53,658
Yes ! Jeff! Jeff!

1208
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:56,394
Debbie and Zeke think they've found it.

1209
00:55:57,033 --> 00:55:58,088
And that's the case !

1210
00:55:58,482 --> 00:56:00,162
Le lounge "Marshalls"

1211
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:04,961
for Zeke, Debbie, Troyzan, Tai, Ozzy and Andrea!

1212
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:12,978
Andrea, Debbie, Zeke,

1213
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,871
Troyzan, Ozzy, Tai.

1214
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:17,549
You will pamper yourself, eat,

1215
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:20,919
while the other six return to the camp.

1216
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,412
You know what it is.

1217
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:24,039
Take your things, let's go!

1218
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:25,165
Oh my God !

1219
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,626
We wasted the day at the "Marshalls" spa.

1220
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,886
It's a big disappointment.

1221
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,285
But I am in a central position.

1222
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,763
I have options.

1223
00:56:33,888 --> 00:56:37,216
And it will be: which group wants to date the person I want to date?

1224
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:38,995
This is the one I will go with.

1225
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:46,445
We come back to the camp

1226
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,108
after losing the "Marshalls" reward event.

1227
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:50,816
No one is at fault.

1228
00:56:51,066 --> 00:56:53,396
It was up to Sierra and me to win it

1229
00:56:53,521 --> 00:56:56,135
and we didn't succeed today.

1230
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,209
We feel miserable.

1231
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:01,719
"Will I accomplish anything,

1232
00:57:01,844 --> 00:57:04,155
accomplish anything?"

1233
00:57:05,237 --> 00:57:07,691
Sometimes we crack and then it gets better.

1234
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:10,491
I'm close to cracking.

1235
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,891
I was a young mother, so I worked very hard

1236
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,040
to meet their needs.

1237
00:57:18,165 --> 00:57:19,578
I wanted never

1238
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:22,806
my children have a need that I cannot meet.

1239
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:24,049
But this game

1240
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:27,284
makes you feel the deepest

1241
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:31,436
and painful feelings that you may have known.

1242
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,626
Especially in defeat, like today.

1243
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,608
Not being able to win for them,

1244
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:39,361
it's like not being able to feed your family.

1245
00:57:39,486 --> 00:57:40,966
This game is so hard.

1246
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:43,941
I always forget how hard it is.

1247
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:46,395
Stopped. You're going to make me cry.

1248
00:57:47,149 --> 00:57:50,261
You don't have children yet, but imagine if you had

1249
00:57:50,386 --> 00:57:51,577
four children

1250
00:57:51,827 --> 00:57:53,971
and they haven't eaten for three days.

1251
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:58,668
You are responsible for finding food for them.

1252
00:57:58,793 --> 00:57:59,851
and you fail.

1253
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,778
You feel like a nobody.

1254
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:03,889
Nobody wants to feel that.

1255
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,035
I worked hard, in my life,

1256
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,912
never to feel that way.

1257
00:58:10,644 --> 00:58:13,332
And that brings you right back to this:

1258
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:15,334
"Are you good for nothing?" That's crazy.

1259
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:17,769
It's heavy.

1260
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,757
My family is my motivation.

1261
00:58:19,882 --> 00:58:21,631
I intend to win for her.

1262
00:58:21,756 --> 00:58:24,810
That's probably why I'm moved.

1263
00:58:25,218 --> 00:58:26,967
It's not your fault, Cirie.

1264
00:58:35,369 --> 00:58:36,615
I'm super excited!

1265
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,048
Oh my God ! Yes !

1266
00:58:39,502 --> 00:58:40,795
Merci, Marshalls !

1267
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,127
So cool !

1268
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:45,598
Marshalls has concocted an incredible spa for us.

1269
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,458
This is the biggest reward to date.

1270
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:48,639
We have a shower!

1271
00:58:48,764 --> 00:58:51,016
There are very nice towels,

1272
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:53,144
amazing relax chairs,

1273
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:55,723
coconut shampoo and conditioner...

1274
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:56,976
Lord !

1275
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,524
Smell that, we would eat it!

1276
00:58:58,649 --> 00:59:00,379
Do you have the snacks? Oh my God !

1277
00:59:00,504 --> 00:59:01,585
Who wants Coke?

1278
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,213
Arriving at the "Marshalls" spa,

1279
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:05,743
I first noticed the smell.

1280
00:59:06,162 --> 00:59:08,555
Here, we are deprived of a lot of smells.

1281
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,911
We all smell the campfire and the sweat.

1282
00:59:11,036 --> 00:59:13,859
So, to smell these pleasant perfumes,

1283
00:59:14,345 --> 00:59:15,494
just that,

1284
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:17,099
it is a reward in itself.

1285
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:20,232
I heard about streaking in the 80s.

1286
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:21,557
Oh my God !

1287
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:26,705
Tai, what the hell are you doing?!

1288
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:32,445
Yeah, buddy!

1289
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,396
Troy, you're next!

1290
00:59:34,797 --> 00:59:37,276
You weren't all doing that in the 60s or 70s?

1291
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:39,018
I was not born! I was not born!

1292
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:40,489
Oh, I know, you're all kids.

1293
00:59:40,614 --> 00:59:43,210
My ex-boyfriend was always talking about streaking in Arkansas.

1294
00:59:43,335 --> 00:59:45,425
I don't know, it seemed appropriate to me.

1295
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,106
I promised myself to have fun.

1296
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:49,920
And it was a fun time.

1297
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,530
Are these cheeseburgers?

1298
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,296
They are huge!

1299
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:54,858
Rewards are great.

1300
00:59:54,983 --> 00:59:56,042
I'm having fun.

1301
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:58,262
Like suddenly I wasn't in Survivor anymore.

1302
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,296
It's the high life!

1303
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:04,831
But by withdrawing from the game like this, sometimes you can get lost.

1304
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,279
C'est Game changers.

1305
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:10,382
Your mind must be working. If it doesn't work all the time,

1306
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:12,509
you're probably not in the game anymore.

1307
01:00:12,634 --> 01:00:14,376
Marshalls was great!

1308
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:16,505
I'm just saying, we could talk

1309
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:19,558
what we would like to put in place over the next few hours.

1310
01:00:19,808 --> 01:00:22,111
We could target Brad and Sierra.

1311
01:00:22,236 --> 01:00:24,788
But Cirie and Andrea

1312
01:00:25,196 --> 01:00:27,774
are very close-knit.

1313
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:30,058
We agree ? Is not it ?

1314
01:00:30,183 --> 01:00:32,392
I'm assembling a team of snipers.

1315
01:00:32,517 --> 01:00:34,106
'Cause I know war is coming.

1316
01:00:34,356 --> 01:00:35,848
Many think here

1317
01:00:35,973 --> 01:00:38,162
that it's going to start somehow.

1318
01:00:38,287 --> 01:00:40,913
But I'll make sure she starts my way.

1319
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:43,466
Cirie has her own plans.

1320
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:47,644
Cirie and Andrea are more or less with us now, but...

1321
01:00:48,071 --> 01:00:50,681
I talked to Andrea, and she said:

1322
01:00:50,806 --> 01:00:52,606
"Don't tell Debbie about it."

1323
01:00:54,244 --> 01:00:55,813
It may not be important.

1324
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:57,196
Donc on sort Andrea.

1325
01:00:57,702 --> 01:00:59,882
Zeke throws a story

1326
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:02,250
to get Tai and me to vote for Andrea.

1327
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:05,137
I was immediately skeptical.

1328
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:08,142
The first question we should always ask in Survivor,

1329
01:01:08,267 --> 01:01:10,342
it's: "Is this information true?"

1330
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:12,903
I can't beat some of them.

1331
01:01:13,028 --> 01:01:15,595
Sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness than to ask permission.

1332
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,751
As in the Air Force: "Act, ask for forgiveness afterwards."

1333
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,611
I find it hard to take what Zeke says

1334
01:01:20,736 --> 01:01:22,288
for cash.

1335
01:01:22,537 --> 01:01:25,753
Because he is trying to build a coalition.

1336
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:30,329
But I don't have in mind to join Zeke's camp.

1337
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:31,951
Make a big hit, okay.

1338
01:01:32,076 --> 01:01:34,221
But I don't know what that means for me.

1339
01:01:34,346 --> 01:01:37,536
I want to make a big hit, but I don't need Zeke.

1340
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,807
Over here, everyone!

1341
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:00,951
Wow.

1342
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:05,822
Ready for today's immunity test?

1343
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:07,658
First of all,

1344
01:02:07,783 --> 01:02:09,435
Andrea, I'm taking the necklace back.

1345
01:02:10,321 --> 01:02:11,322
Merci.

1346
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,678
Once again, immunity is at stake.

1347
01:02:15,803 --> 01:02:17,075
Today,

1348
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,514
you will cling to a pole

1349
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:21,438
as long as you can.

1350
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:23,625
When you let go, it's over.

1351
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,241
The last person to hold

1352
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,515
gain immunity.

1353
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,195
The losers: on the board,

1354
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,822
someone will be the ninth person eliminated

1355
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,291
Game.

1356
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,802
We draw the places at random and we start.

1357
01:02:48,006 --> 01:02:49,007
Good.

1358
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,477
Everyone chose their starting location.

1359
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:55,640
There are many different starting strategies.

1360
01:02:55,765 --> 01:02:57,549
And this ordeal

1361
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:58,724
is thrown.

1362
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:01,853
It's a Survivor classic.

1363
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,762
It is not easy.

1364
01:03:03,887 --> 01:03:06,568
From the first moment, you struggle.

1365
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:09,625
Sierra has competed in this event once.

1366
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,096
She didn't win.

1367
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:13,793
Ozzy wrestled her twice.

1368
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:15,293
He didn't lose.

1369
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:17,802
He is undefeated in this event.

1370
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,638
in his career in Survivor.

1371
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:22,298
No one else here has competed in this event.

1372
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,168
Culpepper begins to slip.

1373
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:27,613
15 seconds have passed

1374
01:03:27,738 --> 01:03:30,282
and it could last two hours.

1375
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,910
Cirie slips quickly.

1376
01:03:35,142 --> 01:03:36,902
Cirie tries to have bon.

1377
01:03:37,027 --> 01:03:38,028
Non.

1378
01:03:38,362 --> 01:03:40,566
Cirie is the first eliminated.

1379
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,628
Take a seat on the bench.

1380
01:03:44,966 --> 01:03:46,840
Sarah begins to move.

1381
01:03:50,183 --> 01:03:51,925
Culpepper slides down.

1382
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,376
And... Finished!

1383
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:55,938
Culpepper exits the ordeal.

1384
01:03:56,063 --> 01:03:57,813
You are only ten.

1385
01:03:59,334 --> 01:04:01,960
Debbie is sliding ever lower.

1386
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:05,203
Sarah slides ever lower.

1387
01:04:08,138 --> 01:04:10,399
There is no comfortable location.

1388
01:04:10,524 --> 01:04:12,537
Aubry will come out of the ordeal.

1389
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,460
No immunity for Aubry.

1390
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,863
You are only nine, already.

1391
01:04:20,263 --> 01:04:23,236
Suddenly, Debbie descends and leaves the event,

1392
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:25,550
by giving up some skin in Fiji.

1393
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:27,005
It's clear !

1394
01:04:27,255 --> 01:04:29,055
You are only eight.

1395
01:04:30,653 --> 01:04:32,003
Zeke is eliminated.

1396
01:04:32,985 --> 01:04:35,598
You are only seven, it goes quickly.

1397
01:04:36,066 --> 01:04:38,069
Damn, that hurts!

1398
01:04:40,074 --> 01:04:41,226
This is serious.

1399
01:04:41,351 --> 01:04:43,121
It's way harder than it looks.

1400
01:04:47,681 --> 01:04:49,132
Sierra is eliminated.

1401
01:04:49,257 --> 01:04:50,821
You are only six.

1402
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:53,298
Half the tribe is eliminated.

1403
01:04:54,482 --> 01:04:57,869
Troyzan is at its last fulcrum.

1404
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,142
Sarah is at her last foothold.

1405
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,906
Troyzan...

1406
01:05:10,614 --> 01:05:12,042
The body finally gives in.

1407
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:13,310
Well done, my friend!

1408
01:05:13,435 --> 01:05:14,529
Bel effort.

1409
01:05:14,654 --> 01:05:16,270
Sarah suit Troyzan.

1410
01:05:16,395 --> 01:05:17,456
His body gives in.

1411
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,425
Ozzy, you're one hell of a champion! More than four.

1412
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:21,693
Michaela,

1413
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:22,753
Andrea,

1414
01:05:22,878 --> 01:05:24,204
Or you don't Ozzy,

1415
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:26,857
who compete for an immunity collar.

1416
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,665
ELAPSED TIME, 20 MINUTES

1417
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:39,968
There is no good grip on this post.

1418
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:46,818
Michaela gives the impression of standing on her fulcrum,

1419
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,286
which is amazing.

1420
01:05:51,521 --> 01:05:52,791
Andrea lutte

1421
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:54,166
to hold on.

1422
01:05:55,814 --> 01:05:57,963
I intend to break my record!

1423
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,953
Andrea. Basically, he said,

1424
01:06:03,078 --> 01:06:05,162
in other words, you don't stand a chance.

1425
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:06,538
It is justified.

1426
01:06:07,203 --> 01:06:09,065
I think it can happen again.

1427
01:06:13,912 --> 01:06:17,932
Michaela adjusts her grip and goes down.

1428
01:06:19,494 --> 01:06:20,540
Bravo !

1429
01:06:20,665 --> 01:06:22,187
She comes down from the pole.

1430
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,831
Bravo !

1431
01:06:23,956 --> 01:06:25,626
Wow, Michaela, what happened?

1432
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:27,626
Ozzy won't come down.

1433
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:30,716
So... I have to think and choose my battles.

1434
01:06:30,841 --> 01:06:31,991
You assured.

1435
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:38,920
ELAPSED TIME, 40 MINUTES

1436
01:06:39,045 --> 01:06:41,145
Your feet are starting to hurt.

1437
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,775
You've been in balance for quite a while.

1438
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:47,479
Andrea replaces.

1439
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:49,247
Always in the race.

1440
01:06:49,684 --> 01:06:51,316
Tai didn't move.

1441
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:53,381
Ozzy didn't move.

1442
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:04,963
Lord !

1443
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,732
Big fall for Andrea. How are you ?

1444
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:12,237
Yes. I didn't want to slip.

1445
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,199
Andrea quits the ordeal.

1446
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:19,077
Which leaves us face to face,

1447
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,913
Tai versus Ozzy.

1448
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,172
two guys

1449
01:07:22,297 --> 01:07:24,249
who seem very comfortable in the trees

1450
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:27,136
or hung on a pole.

1451
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:44,205
ELAPSED TIME, 1 HOUR

1452
01:07:44,986 --> 01:07:46,538
It's been an hour.

1453
01:07:46,788 --> 01:07:49,174
Lord ! Good job guys !

1454
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:52,499
To do one of the hardest things in your life.

1455
01:07:56,798 --> 01:07:58,984
It brings them back

1456
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:01,264
in the "legends" category,

1457
01:08:01,389 --> 01:08:03,622
to stay on this damn thing like that.

1458
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:06,825
Tai is replaced.

1459
01:08:07,343 --> 01:08:09,261
We must keep this body alive.

1460
01:08:09,386 --> 01:08:10,854
He goes numb quickly.

1461
01:08:12,311 --> 01:08:13,789
Ozzy se replace.

1462
01:08:15,988 --> 01:08:18,110
Ozzy, how confident are you,

1463
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:21,171
knowing that you did it twice and won twice?

1464
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:22,852
I know what comes next.

1465
01:08:22,977 --> 01:08:25,377
And it's rough.

1466
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:28,138
We start to suffer, to sweat, to slip...

1467
01:08:28,757 --> 01:08:30,182
But I already did

1468
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:32,530
and if I win, I can go fishing today.

1469
01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:33,914
But otherwise...

1470
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:35,989
We will be hungry one more day.

1471
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,659
That's using your influence!

1472
01:08:41,436 --> 01:08:42,519
Sorry, buddy!

1473
01:08:42,644 --> 01:08:43,762
No problem.

1474
01:08:44,327 --> 01:08:45,897
I try my luck.

1475
01:08:49,928 --> 01:08:52,196
ELAPSED TIME, 1 HOUR 35 MINUTES

1476
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:55,106
Tai and Ozzy, in similar positions.

1477
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,542
Like two monkeys clinging to a tree.

1478
01:08:57,953 --> 01:08:59,153
No problem.

1479
01:09:01,226 --> 01:09:03,215
Ozzy repositions himself slightly.

1480
01:09:03,464 --> 01:09:06,484
Hands can go up to the rope, not over it.

1481
01:09:07,058 --> 01:09:08,453
Ozzy try

1482
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:09,913
to keep his record.

1483
01:09:14,795 --> 01:09:16,252
Tai begins to move.

1484
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,638
Ozzy repositions himself again.

1485
01:09:29,311 --> 01:09:30,809
Nice recovery.

1486
01:09:32,349 --> 01:09:34,359
Tai moved a lot

1487
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:35,839
after standing still.

1488
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,400
Tai struggles to find a foothold.

1489
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,092
Ozzy slides down

1490
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:49,935
and Ozzy is eliminated from the event!

1491
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:53,582
Tai wins individual immunity!

1492
01:09:53,707 --> 01:09:54,991
He dethrones Ozzy,

1493
01:09:55,116 --> 01:09:56,901
who had never lost.

1494
01:09:58,122 --> 01:09:59,270
He sends Ozzy,

1495
01:09:59,521 --> 01:10:01,251
and all the others,

1496
01:10:01,376 --> 01:10:03,400
to the board without immunity. You are a beast!

1497
01:10:03,525 --> 01:10:05,176
Tai will be safe.

1498
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,995
Good job guys !

1499
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,118
Amazing, guys!

1500
01:10:13,243 --> 01:10:14,244
Unbelievable !

1501
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:16,646
You are bleeding. Well done, my friend!

1502
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,152
Tai, come here!

1503
01:10:24,245 --> 01:10:26,556
I can't believe I beat Ozzy!

1504
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,433
The queen, the double champion!

1505
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,102
The king, the king! Not the queen!

1506
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,431
From king to queen!

1507
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:34,266
I wanted to go as far as him.

1508
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:37,095
I have to say, it was an epic ordeal.

1509
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,984
Tai, you won.

1510
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,909
You're safe at the council tonight.

1511
01:10:41,034 --> 01:10:42,303
As for you others,

1512
01:10:42,428 --> 01:10:45,884
tonight someone will be eliminated from Survivor Game Changers.

1513
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:48,476
Take your things, return to camp. See you tonight at the council.

1514
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:50,662
I believe the camps are beginning to form.

1515
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:52,791
You have to choose one

1516
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,994
fast enough, on pain of being on the losing side.

1517
01:10:56,243 --> 01:10:59,517
It will be crazy advice,

1518
01:10:59,642 --> 01:11:02,492
as he could define the rest of the season.

1519
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:14,746
Look at this!

1520
01:11:14,996 --> 01:11:17,783
It tore the skin off my feet.

1521
01:11:18,129 --> 01:11:20,513
After the ordeal, back at the camp,

1522
01:11:20,638 --> 01:11:24,456
I was glad Andrea didn't win immunity,

1523
01:11:24,581 --> 01:11:28,308
because I am preparing for THE battle of the season:

1524
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:29,749
Eliminate Andrea.

1525
01:11:33,204 --> 01:11:35,926
It is your name that is mentioned for the vote.

1526
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:40,264
By Cirie, Andrea and Aubry.

1527
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:45,611
But I'm not really interested in doing that.

1528
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:48,641
What interests me is that Andrea leaves.

1529
01:11:49,663 --> 01:11:51,863
I thought you were pretty close to them.

1530
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:55,354
You might think so, but no.

1531
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:58,790
Zeke suddenly seems to want to switch sides.

1532
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,781
But every time I talk to him,

1533
01:12:00,906 --> 01:12:03,629
I feel like he thinks I'm stupid.

1534
01:12:03,754 --> 01:12:05,287
And I don't trust him.

1535
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:06,818
But if they mention my name,

1536
01:12:06,943 --> 01:12:08,930
I have to find a way to have a majority

1537
01:12:09,055 --> 01:12:10,936
to avoid leaving.

1538
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,842
I was told that my name was mentioned.

1539
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,778
It was Zeke.

1540
01:12:22,021 --> 01:12:26,114
Sierra approached me and said Zeke told her

1541
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,044
that she was going to be eliminated.

1542
01:12:28,408 --> 01:12:30,522
Why the hell do that?

1543
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,716
No idea. It does not make sense.

1544
01:12:33,387 --> 01:12:36,228
I'm furious with Zeke.

1545
01:12:37,067 --> 01:12:39,223
I've been working with him since day one.

1546
01:12:39,348 --> 01:12:42,567
I thought we were not only allies, but also friends.

1547
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:45,228
Best would be to take Zeke out.

1548
01:12:45,553 --> 01:12:47,169
How to achieve it?

1549
01:12:47,294 --> 01:12:48,683
Impossible.

1550
01:12:48,971 --> 01:12:52,411
I learned that in this game, timing is everything.

1551
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:54,779
And between Cirie and me, everything is fine.

1552
01:12:55,029 --> 01:12:58,074
I want her on my side, voting with me

1553
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:00,451
against other people, like Zeke.

1554
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:04,695
Elle a dit : "Zeke me l'a dit."

1555
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:06,824
Really ? Yes.

1556
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:09,433
I was disgusted to hear that.

1557
01:13:09,558 --> 01:13:12,008
I am disgusted. We have to get Zeke out.

1558
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,891
I can't... Is this the new plan?

1559
01:13:15,582 --> 01:13:18,036
How can he believe that it will turn out well for him?

1560
01:13:18,406 --> 01:13:19,407
So that !

1561
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:26,236
What does your instinct tell you?

1562
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,041
The voter Zeke.

1563
01:13:29,095 --> 01:13:30,574
What are you going to tell Zeke?

1564
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,409
Aubry ?

1565
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:38,541
You know, do you really want to take the hand?

1566
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:40,217
On vote Ozzy.

1567
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:44,396
I'm in.

1568
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:45,821
And I would.

1569
01:13:47,147 --> 01:13:48,492
But deal with these idiots,

1570
01:13:49,623 --> 01:13:51,585
it's almost mission impossible.

1571
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:53,597
We could make the decision

1572
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:56,341
and impose it on them, this time.

1573
01:13:57,012 --> 01:13:59,077
It would be a huge and awesome blow.

1574
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:01,104
We did it.

1575
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,774
If you follow us and shut up...

1576
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:06,810
No doubt about it. We take out Ozzy.

1577
01:14:07,113 --> 01:14:08,846
This evening ? Yes.

1578
01:14:08,971 --> 01:14:10,322
Oh my God !

1579
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:11,448
You love Me ?

1580
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:14,696
I don't mind being thought of as eccentric.

1581
01:14:14,821 --> 01:14:17,562
Underestimate me at your peril.

1582
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:20,564
But if everyone listens to me,

1583
01:14:20,814 --> 01:14:24,156
Brad, Sierra, Sarah, Troyzan, Tai...

1584
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:27,431
We take Ozzy out by surprise, we don't tell anyone.

1585
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:32,043
...it'll work, and we'll be great game changers tonight.

1586
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:34,079
Largely thanks to me.

1587
01:14:34,204 --> 01:14:36,058
And I have an extra vote.

1588
01:14:36,183 --> 01:14:37,923
I don't want to use it so soon,

1589
01:14:38,048 --> 01:14:40,626
but I don't know if I have a majority.

1590
01:14:40,751 --> 01:14:42,929
We vote Ozzy, we'll take him out by surprise.

1591
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,448
At this stage,

1592
01:14:45,573 --> 01:14:48,922
I am in the middle of two groups

1593
01:14:49,047 --> 01:14:50,996
which are beginning to emerge.

1594
01:14:51,121 --> 01:14:53,398
Brad's group, Sierra,

1595
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:54,624
Troyzan,

1596
01:14:54,749 --> 01:14:56,167
This, Debbie,

1597
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,334
wants to eliminate Ozzy.

1598
01:14:58,459 --> 01:15:00,196
And there is another group:

1599
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:01,506
Cirie,

1600
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:02,465
Andrea,

1601
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:03,400
Michaela,

1602
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:04,709
Aubry

1603
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:05,835
et Ozzy.

1604
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,660
They want to take Zeke out.

1605
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,115
And I'm weighing my options.

1606
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,006
sort Ozzy,

1607
01:15:12,131 --> 01:15:15,703
it's out a social and physical threat.

1608
01:15:15,828 --> 01:15:18,457
This is the move to do soon after the merger.

1609
01:15:18,582 --> 01:15:21,186
But many want Zeke out,

1610
01:15:21,311 --> 01:15:23,482
because he is smart

1611
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:25,328
and ready to hit.

1612
01:15:25,453 --> 01:15:27,448
And if we trust someone like that,

1613
01:15:27,573 --> 01:15:29,901
we end up being had.

1614
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,892
My position is therefore difficult.

1615
01:15:32,017 --> 01:15:35,710
But with this vote, a demarcation will be established.

1616
01:15:52,082 --> 01:15:54,125
Here is now the first member of the jury.

1617
01:15:57,545 --> 01:16:00,131
Hali, eliminated at the last council.

1618
01:16:05,195 --> 01:16:06,196
Ozzy.

1619
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:09,441
You are among those who have participated the most in this game.

1620
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,510
What is unique about this season?

1621
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:13,903
Somehow, the stakes seem higher.

1622
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,748
Everybody's trying to act like a secret agent,

1623
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:19,150
it spies behind every coconut tree,

1624
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:21,219
idols appear

1625
01:16:21,344 --> 01:16:22,940
then become untraceable,

1626
01:16:23,065 --> 01:16:24,280
where were found...

1627
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:28,201
The mentality is more ruthless.

1628
01:16:28,326 --> 01:16:29,327
Sarah.

1629
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:30,920
It is the 24th day.

1630
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,913
There have been so many changes, different tribes.

1631
01:16:34,038 --> 01:16:38,358
Is it hard to know where the real relationships are?

1632
01:16:38,483 --> 01:16:39,362
Oui.

1633
01:16:39,487 --> 01:16:41,540
I don't know who is with whom.

1634
01:16:41,665 --> 01:16:45,243
We're like a bunch of bachelors looking for partners.

1635
01:16:48,472 --> 01:16:50,815
So if anyone wants to ask me out on a date,

1636
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,390
I'm available.

1637
01:16:55,434 --> 01:16:57,862
Tai. In a game where mistrust is so important,

1638
01:16:57,987 --> 01:16:59,156
gain immunity

1639
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,092
becomes very important.

1640
01:17:01,507 --> 01:17:03,261
Yes. I surprised myself.

1641
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:05,936
When I run a marathon

1642
01:17:06,061 --> 01:17:07,854
it's one step at a time.

1643
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:10,926
But I feel the need to do it, for myself.

1644
01:17:11,051 --> 01:17:13,805
Me against Ozzy, and no longer alone on the post.

1645
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:15,565
And so, Ozzy.

1646
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:17,515
You had never lost this event.

1647
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,148
You lose and return to camp.

1648
01:17:19,273 --> 01:17:21,004
You definitely feel pressure.

1649
01:17:21,129 --> 01:17:22,130
Still.

1650
01:17:22,255 --> 01:17:24,974
We talk to as many people as possible

1651
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,651
and we have to trust

1652
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:29,145
to those who say you can trust them.

1653
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,114
I have value in this game,

1654
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:33,091
because there is nothing to eat in the camp.

1655
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,790
So I'll give my all

1656
01:17:35,915 --> 01:17:38,321
to make sure people are fed.

1657
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,457
It's no small thing to be able to offer that.

1658
01:17:40,582 --> 01:17:42,618
Especially when there are 15 days left.

1659
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:43,860
Aubry.

1660
01:17:43,985 --> 01:17:46,805
You've played before, so you know how it feels.

1661
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:48,180
After 24 days,

1662
01:17:48,305 --> 01:17:51,109
could you hold out if no one caught fish?

1663
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:55,447
I have to say, Jeff, it's a lot harder than my first time.

1664
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,249
Apart from the fact that everyone is suspicious,

1665
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:00,994
it's hard. Coconuts, proteins,

1666
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:04,785
we only get it when Ozzy brings it back.

1667
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:07,158
And it's not just physical,

1668
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:09,160
it's mental, it's moral.

1669
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:12,831
I think we've all had our emotional moments.

1670
01:18:12,956 --> 01:18:14,599
And it affects everything.

1671
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:16,434
Alors, Zeke.

1672
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,603
In Survivor you want to reach the end

1673
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:21,192
and make sure you put people on the jury

1674
01:18:21,317 --> 01:18:22,565
who will vote for you.

1675
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:25,503
Is this still the approach to follow?

1676
01:18:25,628 --> 01:18:28,279
I think we follow more or less the same rules,

1677
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:30,673
we say to ourselves: "Can I beat this or that?"

1678
01:18:30,798 --> 01:18:33,718
One must also ask oneself: "Do they think they can beat me?"

1679
01:18:34,312 --> 01:18:37,391
And if I think they think

1680
01:18:37,516 --> 01:18:39,291
that they can't beat me,

1681
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:41,826
how do i introduce myself

1682
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:44,034
so they think they can beat me?

1683
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,889
It's the most complicated in this season,

1684
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:47,363
find a way to say:

1685
01:18:47,488 --> 01:18:49,893
"I know that you fear me for such and such a reason,

1686
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:52,537
but it's actually not an asset,

1687
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:55,573
on the contrary, it is what will enable you to beat me."

1688
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:58,934
Tai. Did you notice a difference between your first participation

1689
01:18:59,059 --> 01:19:01,513
and this one, in terms of subtlety,

1690
01:19:01,638 --> 01:19:03,936
nuances of communication,

1691
01:19:04,061 --> 01:19:06,584
when English is not your mother tongue?

1692
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:08,787
Yes, it's incredibly different.

1693
01:19:08,912 --> 01:19:10,413
Everyone is very suspicious.

1694
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:12,456
And even now, hearing that,

1695
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,825
I'm like, "Wow, now I get it!"

1696
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,195
What Zeke just said? Exactly.

1697
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,697
It's incredible,

1698
01:19:18,822 --> 01:19:21,291
his way of seeing things from different angles.

1699
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:23,927
It had never occurred to me to think about it like this.

1700
01:19:24,315 --> 01:19:26,971
Zeke, when you hear another player, on the board,

1701
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:28,807
say, "He's amazing!"

1702
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:30,441
do you want to say:

1703
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:33,510
"Oh no, please don't say that right before the vote!" ?

1704
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,811
There is always a minimum of worry, that's for sure.

1705
01:19:36,936 --> 01:19:39,512
But sometimes I think it's gonna be okay for me.

1706
01:19:39,637 --> 01:19:43,058
And these moments of peace are necessary to last 24 days.

1707
01:19:43,183 --> 01:19:45,757
Otherwise, I'd be on my toes all the time.

1708
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:49,594
Debbie. At the end of the day, Survivor is all about strategy.

1709
01:19:49,843 --> 01:19:52,831
Who to eliminate, who you think will vote for you

1710
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:54,206
if you go to the end?

1711
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,191
Absolutely.

1712
01:19:55,316 --> 01:19:57,335
As an Air Force Auxiliary,

1713
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:00,847
one must gather facts, evaluate information,

1714
01:20:00,972 --> 01:20:02,846
make a plan, execute it.

1715
01:20:02,971 --> 01:20:04,309
The difference,

1716
01:20:04,434 --> 01:20:06,870
it's that the people around me would have my back.

1717
01:20:06,995 --> 01:20:10,682
These people are pointing their daggers at my back!

1718
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,550
This is madness.

1719
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:13,676
So,

1720
01:20:13,801 --> 01:20:15,887
I don't know who I am with.

1721
01:20:17,315 --> 01:20:18,857
It's crazy.

1722
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:20,558
Ciri. what did you think about,

1723
01:20:20,683 --> 01:20:22,752
today, thinking about who to eliminate?

1724
01:20:23,033 --> 01:20:24,996
Well, in this moment,

1725
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:26,531
to whom, in my opinion,

1726
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:29,692
showed a certain level

1727
01:20:29,817 --> 01:20:32,626
of confidence so that I can believe his words,

1728
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:34,372
or vice versa.

1729
01:20:34,782 --> 01:20:37,675
This is how I determine my vote tonight.

1730
01:20:40,865 --> 01:20:42,680
Good. It's time to vote.

1731
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:44,516
Sierra, over to you.

1732
01:20:58,973 --> 01:21:00,847
Terrible initiative, you suck at this game.

1733
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:02,525
I hope never to see you again.

1734
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:15,914
It's just to spice it up.

1735
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:35,799
I will count the votes.

1736
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:36,825
Jeff.

1737
01:21:40,188 --> 01:21:41,638
Before that...

1738
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:47,445
And so, in Exile,

1739
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,619
I gave up the vital essential

1740
01:21:49,744 --> 01:21:51,708
to be able to have an advantage in the game.

1741
01:21:52,842 --> 01:21:55,111
And that benefit is...? An additional vote.

1742
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:58,003
And you're going to use it tonight. Yes.

1743
01:21:58,128 --> 01:22:00,725
Good. Go use your extra vote.

1744
01:22:16,866 --> 01:22:18,334
I will count the votes.

1745
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:26,316
If anyone has an immunity idol and wants to play it,

1746
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,910
now is the time to do it.

1747
01:22:31,606 --> 01:22:34,008
Good. Once the votes have been read, the decision is final.

1748
01:22:34,133 --> 01:22:36,794
The eliminated person will leave the board immediately.

1749
01:22:37,044 --> 01:22:38,429
I will read the votes.

1750
01:22:40,204 --> 01:22:41,466
Premier vote :

1751
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:44,059
Ozzy.

1752
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:46,796
Zeke.

1753
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:49,799
Sierra.

1754
01:22:51,725 --> 01:22:53,444
Aubrey. One Aubry vote,

1755
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:54,646
a Zeke vote,

1756
01:22:54,771 --> 01:22:55,838
vote Sierra,

1757
01:22:55,963 --> 01:22:57,148
un vote Ozzy.

1758
01:22:58,113 --> 01:22:59,763
Zeke. Deux votes Zeke.

1759
01:23:01,392 --> 01:23:03,042
Ozzy. Two Ozzy votes.

1760
01:23:05,949 --> 01:23:07,759
Zeke. That's three Zeke votes.

1761
01:23:09,956 --> 01:23:11,554
Ozzy. Three Ozzy votes,

1762
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:12,755
three votes Zeke.

1763
01:23:14,968 --> 01:23:17,402
Zeke. Quarter votes Zeke.

1764
01:23:20,431 --> 01:23:22,173
Ozzy. Quatre votes Ozzy,

1765
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:23,441
four votes Zeke.

1766
01:23:25,802 --> 01:23:27,103
That's crazy.

1767
01:23:28,377 --> 01:23:30,381
Ozzy. That's five Ozzy votes,

1768
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:31,816
four votes Zeke.

1769
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:38,856
Ninth person eliminated and second member of the jury...

1770
01:23:39,106 --> 01:23:41,932
Ozzy. That's six, that's enough. Bring me your torch.

1771
01:23:42,057 --> 01:23:43,486
I don't know, man.

1772
01:23:51,788 --> 01:23:53,438
Ozzy, the tribe has spoken.

1773
01:23:54,677 --> 01:23:55,698
Bravo.

1774
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:58,771
Good luck with the food.

1775
01:24:01,482 --> 01:24:02,914
It's time to go.

1776
01:24:10,389 --> 01:24:11,881
Well, it's very clear,

1777
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:13,349
in view of the reactions,

1778
01:24:13,474 --> 01:24:16,294
that after all these debates on mistrust,

1779
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:18,763
a punch has just been given.

1780
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,356
Take your torches, return to camp. Good night.

1781
01:24:31,825 --> 01:24:34,645
Stay with us, to see a preview of the next episode.

1782
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,980
Next time in Survivor...

1783
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:39,012
We don't take gloves anymore.

1784
01:24:39,137 --> 01:24:40,384
You are all weird.

1785
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:41,985
Will I trust Zeke again?

1786
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,211
Of course not.

1787
01:24:43,336 --> 01:24:45,190
An alliance seems invincible.

1788
01:24:45,315 --> 01:24:46,722
Now that we have Sarah,

1789
01:24:46,847 --> 01:24:49,302
the boundary is concrete.

1790
01:24:49,427 --> 01:24:51,128
But nothing is set in stone.

1791
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,420
We can take a hit.

1792
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:54,531
And how do I want to make a hit!

1793
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,588
I didn't see it coming.

1794
01:24:56,713 --> 01:24:59,052
But I knew it was inevitable.

1795
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:02,700
I played hard. I must have overestimated my worth.

1796
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:05,803
But if we don't win immunity, we don't have an idol,

1797
01:25:05,928 --> 01:25:07,535
we meet in my place.

1798
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,400
Survivor is a way of life.

1799
01:25:09,525 --> 01:25:12,207
It changed me in an unforgettable way.

1800
01:25:12,332 --> 01:25:14,551
I am infinitely grateful.
