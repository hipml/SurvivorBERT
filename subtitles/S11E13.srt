on<i> Survivor:</i>

00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,588
>> Now that there are six of us

4
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,589
left, I'm next to have my head

5
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,799
chopped off.

6
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:08,425
>> PROBST: Danni felt vulnerable

7
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,719
but remained optimistic.

8
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,053
>> This perfect little alliance

9
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,012
is going to have to start

10
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:13,805
breaking up.

11
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:14,431
I'm definitely not going down

12
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,015
without a fight.

13
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,058
>> PROBST: Sold!

14
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,601
The survivors participated in an

15
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:18,810
auction.

16
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,477

>> Sold.

19
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,188
And Danni outbid the others for

20
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,273
a secret clue that could help

21
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,149
her at the next immunity

22
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,150
challenge.

23
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,110
It needs to remain sealed.

24
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,236
We'll deal with it when you get

25
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,112
to the next challenge.

26
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,739

loved one.

31
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,077
>> $60, $70, $880.

32

33
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,998
with his wife, Kristin.

34
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,583
Judd, you have purchased the

00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,335
right to invite two other loved

36
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,670
ones to camp with you as well.

38
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,213
>> Yes!

39
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,423
>> Cindy, without a doubt, and

40
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,424
I'm going to take my Jersey girl

41
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,717
with me.

42
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,760

00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,094
and Stephenie's boyfriend

44
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,721
Michael joined them.

45
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,974
Danni, Rafe, and Lydia were

46
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,350
exiled from the group and forced

47
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,101
to spend the night at the old

48
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,020
Yaxha camp.

49
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:02,729
>> This is lake water that we

50
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,813
got boil.

>> PROBST: While the loved ones

52
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:12,363
got a taste of camp life.

53
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,782
At the old Yaxha camp, Danni and

54
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,325
Rafe strategized.

55
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,326
>> We just need to catch Judd in

56
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,621
some kind of lie, so that we can

57
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,622
show Steph...

58
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,456
>> The only person I really feel

59
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,165
like I can't trust now is Rafe.

60
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,168
I'm important to have around for

61
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,128
him because they have to see '05

62
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,254
as the threat.

63
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,589
>> PROBST: The next morning,

64
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,508
Danni, Rafe, and Lydia returned

65
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,134
to camp and the loved ones said

66
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:33,510
their good-byes.

67
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,012
>> Bye-bye, you guys!

68
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,555
>> PROBST: Before the immunity

69
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,306
challenge, Lydia tried to ally

70
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,307
herself with Judd, while Danni

71
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,518
listened in.

72
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,238
In a mental challenge for

73
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,615
immunity, Danni used her secret

74
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,033
clue from the auction.

75
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,243
>> "Switch positions with any

76
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,410
player."

77
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,161
I'm going to switch with Steph.

78
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,704
>> PROBST: The clue paid off

79
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,289
when Danni beat out Steph.

80
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,250
Danni wins immunity.

81
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,709
You are safe tonight at Tribal

82
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,710
Council.

83
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,088
Danni's next move was to target

84
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,965
Judd by exposing his earlier

85
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,341
conversation.

86
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,974
>> I'd like to believe Judd, but

87
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,058
he's already been caught in

88
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:22,600
quite a few lies, and Danni

89
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,855
really hasn't lied at all.

90
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,439
>> PROBST: Danni's maneuvering

91
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,816
worked.

92
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,859
Judd and Cindy were taken by

93
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,402
surprise when Stephenie, Rafe,

94
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,946
Lydia and Danni banded together

95
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,865
and voted out Judd.

96
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,866
>> Thanks, guys.

97
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,449
Hope you guys all get bit by a

98
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,325
freaking crocodile.

99
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,786
Scumbags.

100
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,996
>> PROBST: Judd, the tribe has

101
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,371
spoken.

102
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,248
Five are left.

103
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,292
Who will be voted out tonight?

104
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,511
(<i> theme song playing</i> )

105
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,698
>> It was just really hard for

106
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,116
me, because I had been really

107
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,659
close to him.

108
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:02,992
But as he spoke.

109
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,202
>> Scumbags?

110
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,578
>> Scumbags, and hopes we get

111
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,621
eaten by crocodiles.

112
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,289
I mean, he almost started to

113
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,832
turn into Jamie a little bit.

114
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,251
>> He was pissed.

115
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,419
>> Judd got voted out tonight,

116
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,088
completely blindsided.

117
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,465
Stephenie and Rafe broke that

118
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,967
alliance, and I had been praying

119
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,010
for a crack in that alliance.

120
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,888
>> Cindy, I wanted to tell you

121
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:24,889
so bad.

122
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,807
>> You didn't have to tell me,

123
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,058
but, you know, to talk to me,

124
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,810
and then you could tell by a

125
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,478
conversation with me, which way

126
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,605
I'm leaning.

127
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,606
I thought we were voting out

128
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,358
Lydia, and that was our plan

129
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,653
for, you know, the past few

130
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,447
days, but, apparently, I was not

131
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,449
privileged to the information.

132
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,243
>> Judd's gone tonight, and

133
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,369
you're still here.

134
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:46,869
Like, you know, I mean, it

135
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,537
wasn't like I was making a

136
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,205
decision whether to vote you

137
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,081
out.

138
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:50,873
>> I just don't want to follow

139
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,666
in Jamie and Judd's footsteps,

140
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,542
but the pattern makes me

141
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,418
nervous.

142
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,335
You didn't tell Judd that you

143
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,754
were voting out Jamie, and now

144
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,797
Jamie is gone, and then you

145
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,424
didn't tell me that you were

146
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,717
voting out Judd, and now Judd is

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,676
gone, so then where does that

148
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,552
put me?

149
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,594
Next thing you know, I'm going

150
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,345
to be gone.

151
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,388
>> No, it could be any of us.

152
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,723
>> I know it could be, but I see

153
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,349
a little pattern there, and it

154
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:08,850
makes me uncomfortable.

155
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,559
Judd is gone, and I'm still

156
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,394
here, so I'm going to have to

157
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:28,453
deal with it... move on.

158
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,871
>> How fitting is this that

159
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,872
you're the only guy left?

160
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,915
>> It's hilarious.

161
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,541
And the hardest survivor ever,

162
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,127
it's the gay guy and four women

163
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,253
in the final five.

164
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,005
>> All the boys pretty much are

165
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,007
on the jury.

166
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,591
>> I'm the last man standing.

167
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,469
I'm sitting around camp with

168
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,553
four girls, and I'm really

169
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,554
happy.

170
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,555
It's like Rafe's Angels around

171
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,557
camp.

172
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,975
>> Things we're not going to

173
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,018
miss about Guatemala.

174
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,436
>> Naked Judd.

175
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,521
(<i> laughter</i> )

176
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,898
It's kind of like when Judd is

177
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,565
voted out, that the cool kid

178
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,860
kind of left the class, and now

179
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,861
we can all be like a little

180
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,570
bit dorkier, a little bit more

181
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,697
fun.

182
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,449
(<i> laughter</i> )

183
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,992
>> Make yourselves cross-eyed.

184
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,244
>> Ooh, that's very disturbing.

185
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,371
(<i> laughter</i> )

186
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,539
>> I know.

187
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,624
>> No, not quite.

188
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,751
>> What am I doing?

189
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,794
>> You're just opening them

190
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,586
really wide.

191
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,670

Ready, aim, fire!

384
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,190
Cindy, obliterates her tile.

Down to Danni and Steph.

387
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,737
Next one to break their tile

388
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,905
moves on to the final round.

395
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,215
a night away from camp.

396
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,467
Survivors ready.

397
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,510
Go!

398
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:44,972
Cindy has her bag open.

399
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,932
So does Steph.

400
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,850
Both Steph and Cindy working on

401
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,311
the puzzle.

402
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,313
It's based on the Maya calendar.

403
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,690
You should know that calendar by

404
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,608
now.

405
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,609
You've done this challenge

406
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,485
before.

407
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,236
Steph making good progress on

408
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
her puzzle.

409
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,573
Cindy right behind.

410
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,619
Cindy working on that outer edge

411
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,871

412
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,248
Steph working from left to

413
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,333
right.

414
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,167
Making some progress.

415
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,086
Two different strategies on

416
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,547
putting this puzzle together.

417
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,469
Cindy very close.

418
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,139
Cindy on her last piece.

419
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,390
She has it.

420
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,850
Cindy's good.

421
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,768
She's in her cart.

422
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,101
>> Go, Cindy.

423
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,896
>> PROBST: She has it!

424
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,942

425
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,735

Cindy wins reward!

428
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,117

429
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,915
>> PROBST: Here are the keys.

430
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,792

>> PROBST: To the 2006 Pontiac

Torrent.

433
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,003
You've also won a barbecue

434
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,004
feast.

435
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,215
And the right to invite one

436
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,883
person to join you on that

437
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,134
feast.

438
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,845
But before you answer... you may

439
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,889
or may not know, but in ten

440
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,434

superstitious kind, believe it

446
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,654
is the curse of the car.

447
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,614
So, I'm going to give you a

448
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,615
chance to get rid of that curse

449
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,993
right now, perhaps change your

450
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,244

452
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,205
>> PROBST: If you want, you can

453
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,624
give up your car and instead

454
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,503
each of the other four will get

455
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,964
a Pontiac Torrent.

456
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,048

be, Cindy?

465
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,160
>> I normally don't believe in

466
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,496
superstitions, but I also want

them to have cars.

468
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,131
I also believe in making the

469
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,176
impossible possible, which means

470
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,219
screw the curse.

471
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,846
I can win the car and the

472
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,097
million dollars if I play my

473
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,974
cards right and if I do my best.

474
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,310
>> PROBST: Tough decision.

475
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,895
You gotta make a decision right

476
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:38,604
now.

477
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,064
What's it going to be?

478
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:48,697
>> I think I'm going to say...

479
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,115
I would love to give everyone a

car... but I'm here to beat the

481
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,413

486
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,211
You will take one person with

487
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,087
you.

488
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,088
The other three will stay back

489
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,089
at camp.

Steph, you're riding with her.

doesn't mean they're gonna say

509
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,034
give her a million bucks.

My mind is still just reeling

that this is even, you know,

522
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,275

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,352
>> Yeah, I will.

573
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,144
>> Thank you. Nice to meet you.

574
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,065
>> Oh, my God.

575
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,316
Gosh, look at all that meat.

576
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,693
More meat than we've seen in 30-

577
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,277
some days.

578
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,320
>> Yeah, it is.

579
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,614
I'm so excited.

580
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,658
To your new car.

581
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,118
>> Thank you.

582
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,078
>> Cheers to that.

583
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,079
>> Thank you.

>> Never in<i> Survivor</i> has the

585
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,540
winner of the car ever won the

586
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,999
million dollars.

587
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,584
So they, like, call it the

588
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,544
<i>Survivor</i> curse of the cars.

589
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,587
Oh, my gosh, they're going to be

590
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,130
so jealous, they're going to

591
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:52,631
vote us out right away.

592
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,591
It was really hard because you

593
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,468
look at all the four people,

594
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,219
and you're thinking, when in my

595
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,178
life will I ever have the

596
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,722
capacity to give four

597
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,350
people new cars?

598
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,102
Like, I don't know anybody who

599
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,395
has the ability to do that.

600
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,355
Maybe Oprah.

601
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,315
If you win, you win.

602
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,191
>> Yeah, why should you feel

603
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,776
bad?

604
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,569
>> I don't know.

605
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,403
>> I think at this point, there

606
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,404
are no guarantees.

607
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,405
They're not going to give you a

608
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,406
million dollars because you

609
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,449
gave them a car.

610
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:23,579
So I took the car, and I don't

611
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,248
think anybody was bitter about

612
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,292
it at all.

613
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,588
>> I was, like, shocked.

614
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,049
I just couldn't believe that

615
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,050
that was the decision Cindy

616
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,051
made.

617
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,052
For me, that didn't seem like a

618
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:39,761
choice.

619
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,388
It was, like, you have to give

620
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,973
the car to the four other

621
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,765
people.

622
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,892
Like, there was nothing else I

623
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,684
would have done.

624
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,602
Like, I never would have taken

625
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,729
the car for myself.

626
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,355
I was standing there, and I'm

627
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,357
going like, oh, my gosh.

628
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,317
This is so sad for Cindy.

629
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,234
She deserves that so much.

630
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,069
>> Uh-huh.

631
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,279
>> And now she has to give it

632
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,488
up, because there's, like, no

633
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,323
other choice.

634
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,532
>> Yeah, yeah, that's exactly

635
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,575
what I was thinking.

636
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,826
I was like, oh, no.

637
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,785
You know, I was just like, you

638
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,537
know, oh, my God.

639
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,663
I actually thought Cindy would

640
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,040
do it, because I would have done

641
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,124
it in a heartbeat.

642
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:12,211
Because you would have four

643
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:12,836
people who were very happy with

644
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,253
you.

645
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,213
>> In my mind I'm thinking:

646
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:15,797
"Cindy, keep the car, you

647
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,381
deserve it.

648
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,382
You won it rightfully," you

649
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,384
know...

650
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,385
>> She needed a car.

651
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,637
>> Yeah.

652
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,638
>> I was just thinking, like,

653
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,305
four people can have a car, or

654
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,350
one... you know what I mean?

655
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,893
I know that if Cindy had decided

656
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,645
to give the four of us cars,

657
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,022
there's no way on earth I could

658
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:32,648
vote her out at the next Tribal

659
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,273
Council.

660
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,526
But now you never know what's

661
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,405
going to happen.

662
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,823
>> My God, this is so good.

663
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,492
That steak is unreal.

664
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,285
That good?

665
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,205
>> Mmmm-hmmm.

669
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,292
>> It was so good.

670
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,419
There's so much to eat.

had cooked our food, and he sat

675
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,302
down and told us story after

676
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,888
story about the Mayans and

677
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,847
the ruins and answered

678
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,849
questions.

679
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,934

the time?

681
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,061
>> All the time.

682
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:15,065
Corn is the basic food of the

683
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:19,611
Maya then and the Maya now.

684
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,029

cool.

>> And Yaxha means water.

691
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,043
So green-blue water is the lake

00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,146
I was able to spend a lot of

732

time with Stephenie and find out

00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,565
what the heck was going on.

734
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,858
If we beat each other, that's

735
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,859
one thing, but she would beat us

We came up with the concept that

740
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,530
Danni was our biggest threat at

741
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,531
this point.

742
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,325
So, we should try to take Danni

743
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:48,617
out next.

She's gonna come on stronger

747
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,331
by the day because the stakes

748
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:54,623

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,905
>> So early.

762
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,532
>> Cindy, did you drive it okay?

763
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,574
>> Yeah, it drives so nice.

764
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,868
>> It drives so nice.

765
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,329
>> Like, I can't believe that

766
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:34,830
that car handles that way.

767
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,124
The suspension and everything is

768
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,125
so nice.

769
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,417
I mean, you barely even felt the

770
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:39,626
rocks.

771
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,545
I was just like, this is like a

772
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,881
freaking luxury vehicle.

773
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,466
>> I really never expected I

774
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,009
would own a brand-new vehicle in

775
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:48,844
my entire life.

776
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,511
Like, every time I go out to get

777
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,764
in it, anybody who's with me,

778
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,141
I'm just going to be, like, you

779
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,143
like my car?

780
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,270
I love the way the tires are

781
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,771
shaped, and I love the way the

782
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,856
taillights look.

783
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,940
>> That's why I asked.

784
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:02,691
It's cute that Cindy is

785
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,152
really, really excited about the

786
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:05,694
car, but at the same time, I

787
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,570
think it's grating on people a

788
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,654
little bit.

789
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,365
>> I've never really never for

790
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,700
once ever in my life ever

791
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,243
considered that I would own a

792
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,161
brand-new vehicle.

793
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:14,703
I mean, the thought never

794
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,579
crossed my mind.

795
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,831
>> You can only hear so much

796
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,582
about something that everyone

797
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,876
else could have had, too.

798
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,585
>> You never expect stuff like

799
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:21,793
that.

800
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,713
>> Like, if you can't read that

801
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,923
body language, um, no one

802
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,550
listening when you're talking

803
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,719
about the car, you know, it's

804
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,179
probably best to stop that talk.

805
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,388
>> There's no guarantee that

806
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,347
you're going to win.

807
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,724
I really don't think winning a

808
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,725
car has anything to do with it.

809
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:36,892
>> No.

810
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,102
>> You have a brand-new, nice-

811
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:39,895
smelling vehicle.

812
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,146
>> It was so unexpected.

813
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,147
They were excited to hear about

814
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,106
the car.

815
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,608
Everyone seemed to think that

816
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,525
choosing the car and the reward

817
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,569
for myself was the right thing

818
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:47,736
to do.

819
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,654
No one, um, seemed to have any

820
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,116
qualms about it at all.

821
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,159
>> She's so happy about the car.

822
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:54,743
I mean, that's all she talked

823
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,577
about was the car.

824
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,037
>> Really?

825
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,913
>> She felt bad.

826
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,164
Now, I'm like, why are you going

827
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,498
to feel bad?

828
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,082
Why are you going to give the

829
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:01,625
car up?

830
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,336
>> Yeah, well, see, Danni and I

831
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,296
both thought that she was.

832
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,214
>> So did I.

833
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,924
She was considering it.

834
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,301
>> I... I didn't-- Danni and I

835
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,594
both thought there wasn't any

836
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,762
other option than to give up the

837
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,263
car.

838
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,473
>> What do you mean?

839
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,141
>> Like, if they had asked me

840
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,684
that, like, there's no way I

841
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,852
would have kept it.

842
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,728
>> Really? Why?

843
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,729
>> No way.

844
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,356
Because it's like four of you

845
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:24,814
guys could have a car.

846
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,565
>> You thought you had to give

847
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,359
it up?

848
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,443
>> Not that you had to, but I

849
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,861
just... I would have.

850
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,654
>> Really?!

851
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,155
I didn't think anybody would

852
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,114
have.

853
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:33,865
That's a tough decision.

854
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,741
>> Yeah.

855
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,784
>> I don't think I would have

856
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,660
done it.

857
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,661
I could not believe he said, "I

858
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,621
would have gave the other four

859
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:39,871
the car."

860
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,624
I was like... no way.

861
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,876
Seriously, sometimes I just feel

862
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,961
like Rafe does try to play the

863
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,962
martyr a little bit.

864
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,672
That was like the first time

865
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,589
Rafe and I have ever disagreed

866
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,258
the whole game.

867
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,342
Wow, that's surprising.

868
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,635
I don't think I would have.

869
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,678
>> I would have in like a

870
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,595
heartbeat.

871
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,680
>> But a car when you don't have

872
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,681
one?

873
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,975
Lydia, you would have given up

874
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,101
the car?

875
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,812
>> I think Cindy made the right

876
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,437
choice.

877
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,522
>> Yeah.

878
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,107
>> The only thing that I was

879
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,732
thinking about is the fact that

880
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,817
you can give four other people

881
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,986
a car, and it seems like

882
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,779
everyone else was thinking about

883
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,030
what they could have.

884
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:14,823
So, it kind of made me think

885
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,658
like, am I playing this game too

886
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,659
nicely right now?

887
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,370
Like, should I be playing this

888
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:20,996
game a little bit harder than I

889
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,747
am?

890
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,668
(<i> bird squawking</i> )

891
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:37,137
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

892
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,555
Hello, everybody.

893
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,597
>> Hello.

894
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,765
>> So, tell me about the

895
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,683
reward, Cindy.

896
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,684
How did it go?

897
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,685
>> It was overwhelming.

898
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,478
We had, you know, some yummy

899
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,397
food, and all the while that

900
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,440
we're cooking and eating, I

901
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,441
could see out of the

902
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,150
corner of my eye that car

903
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,693
sitting there, and to know how

904
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,695
awesome it is and that it's

905
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:53,862
mine.

906
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,738
>> PROBST: All right, you ready

907
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,032
to get to today's immunity

908
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,033
challenge?

909
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,784
First things first, give it up,

910
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,410
Danni.

911
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,912
>> Oh, gosh.

912
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,830
>> Looks good on you.

913
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,999
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

914
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,335
back up for grabs.

915
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:08,918
For today's challenge, you're

916
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,671
each going to begin attached to

917
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,882
one long piece of rope, which is

918
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,009
wound around a series of poles.

919
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,469
Your goal is to unwind enough

920
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,762
rope to reach the finish line.

921
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,015
In addition, your hands and your

922
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,391
feet will be shackled.

923
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
On my "go," you'll reach for ten

924
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,352
keys.

925
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,395
Use one of the keys to unlock

926
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,730
your hands.

927
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,190
Once your hands are free, you'll

928
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:30,899
move on to the next pole where

929
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,401
you'll unlock your rope and

930
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,569
unwind it from that pole.

931
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,905
When you reach the last lock,

932
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,282
you will also release one final

933
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:39,908
key.

934
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,452
That will unshackle your feet.

935
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,120
If you think you've untangled

936
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,288
enough rope, sprint to your

937
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,539
flag pole.

938
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,249
First person to the finish to

939
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,918
release their tribe flag wins

940
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,463
immunity-- guaranteed a spot

941
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,964
in the final four.

942
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:55,965
Clear?

943
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,925
>> Yeah.

944
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:57,759
>> PROBST: We'll draw first

945
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,803
spots, and we'll get started.

946
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,848
Here we go.

947
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,767
For immunity and a guaranteed

948
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,894
spot in the final four,

949
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,730
survivors ready?

950
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,149
Go!

951
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:13,817
First thing you have to do is

952
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,735
unlock your hands.

953
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,821
There are ten keys, not all of

954
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,489
them work.

955
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,241
Steph finds her key very

956
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:21,825
quickly.

957
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,743
Off to a lead.

958
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,829
Rafe right behind.

959
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,456
Working on their second locks.

960
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,291
Steph and Rafe.

961
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,420
Cindy, Danni, Lydia, still

962
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,879
searching for that first key

963
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,423
to get their hands free.

964
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,258
Cindy's now free.

965
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,259
She's working on her second

966
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,051
lock.

967
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,804
Danni and Lydia still not free.

968
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,057
Steph has her second lock

969
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,100
undone.

970
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,852
Cindy has her second lock

971
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,769
undone.

972
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,521
Now begins the unwinding of the

973
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,480
rope.

974
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,066
Hopping over rope, crawling

975
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,234
through and around a pole.

976
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,861
Cindy hopping around.

977
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:58,862
It's Cindy and Steph in the

978
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,779
lead.

979
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,030
Rafe still working on his second

980
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:01,906
lock.

981
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,867
Lydia has her hands free.

982
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,076
She's at her second lock.

983
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,828
Danni has her hands free.

984
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,496
Everybody's free.

985
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,874
Steph with a bit of a lead.

986
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,791
Cindy trying to catch up.

987
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,877
Rafe trying to get in it.

988
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,837
Steph working on her third lock.

989
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,299
Cindy moving slowly with those

990
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,592
legs shackled.

991
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,677
Rafe trying to catch up.

992
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,054
Danni and Lydia still behind.

993
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,182
Steph on her third lock.

994
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,516
Cindy now working on her third

995
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,850
lock.

996
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,311
It's Steph and Cindy.

997
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,646
Rafe trying to get enough slack

998
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,690
to get his feet over and not

999
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:36,357
fall over.

1000
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,358
Lydia has her second lock

1001
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:37,817
undone.

1002
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,861
She's back in it.

1003
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,946
Lydia moving quickly through

1004
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,864
these ropes.

1005
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,990
Steph still working on her third

1006
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:44,824
lock.

1007
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,159
Lydia is now at her third lock.

1008
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,619
Cindy at her third lock.

1009
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,412
Rafe now at his third lock.

1010
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,414
Danni has her second lock

1011
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,373
undone.

1012
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,209
Steph's been at her lock for a

1013
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,503
long time, trying key after key.

1014
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,379
Everybody's still in it.

1015
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,590
Who's going to find the key

1016
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,051
first?

1017
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:03,885
Steph has her lock undone.

1018
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,721
Steph now moving towards her

1019
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:08,056
fourth and final lock.

1020
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,225
Cindy has her third lock undone.

1021
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:10,975
She's in it.

1022
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,061
Steph working on her fourth and

1023
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:13,353
final lock.

1024
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,812
Rafe's in it.

1025
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,939
He's got his third lock undone.

1026
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,858
Steph has her final lock undone.

1027
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,443
She has the final key.

1028
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,612
She's got to unshackle her feet.

1029
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,029
Steph, very close.

1030
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,073
Cindy not giving up.

1031
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,908
Steph, unshackles her feet,

1032
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,328
Cindy racing, Rafe's back in it.

1033
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,664
Steph getting as much rope as

1034
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,123
she can, taking off to the

1035
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,208
finish.

1036
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,293
Got to reach the flag and

1037
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,127
release it.

1038
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:42,507
Will she have enough?

1039
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:42,924
Steph just short.

1040
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,050
She's got a knot, trying to undo

1041
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,718
it.

1042
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,220
Cindy in her final lock.

1043
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,305
If she can get it open in time,

1044
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,473
she's got a shot.

1045
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,600
Steph did not have enough rope.

1046
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,686
Still doesn't have enough rope.

1047
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,646
She's got another knot to undo.

1048
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,523
Cindy fighting to get back in

1049
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,315
this.

1050
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,900
Steph within a couple of feet.

1051
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,111
Will she have enough rope?

1052
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,197
Guaranteed spot in the final

1053
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,699
four if she does.

1054
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,950
Cindy is at her final lock,

1055
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,578
can't get it open.

1056
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,161
Steph releases the last knot.

1057
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:17,125
Will this be enough?

1058
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,626
Steph wins immunity!

1059
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,669
Guaranteed spot in the final

1060
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,044
four!

1061
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:24,257
>> Oh, my God, finally I won

1062
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,966
something!

00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:27,969
individual win?

1065

>> Yeah.

1066
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,101
>> PROBST: Steph, you've come a

1067
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,019
long way from day one when you

1068
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,313
weren't sure you'd make it

1069
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,147
through the first Tribal

1070
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,064
Council.

1071
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,899
With this, you're guaranteed a

1072
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,026
spot in the final four.

1073
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,110
>> Good job, Stephenie.

1074
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,069
>> Good job, Stephenie.

1075
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,697
>> PROBST: Rafe, Cindy, Danni,

1076

Lydia, 36 long days about to

1077
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,451
come to an end for one of you

1078
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,452
tonight.

1079
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,161
Tribal Council should be a very

1080
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,079
interesting afternoon.

1081
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,664
Grab your stuff, head back to

1082
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,041
camp, I'll see you at Tribal.

00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,810
Your family is going to be so

1086
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,811
proud of you.

Day 36.

00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:21,981
Mark it on your torch.

immunity.

1097
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,535
It's the most amazing feeling,

1098
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,286
like, ever.

1099
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,747
I just guaranteed myself a spot

1100
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,290
in the final four, and I did

1101
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,083
not think I was going to get

1102
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,960
past the first Tribal Council in

1103
00:32:43,044 --> 00:33:13,783
the game.

1104
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,450
>> I really feel like I can

1105
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,785
trust Rafe.

1106
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,453
He said that he wouldn't vote

1107
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,371
for me.

1108
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,706
I don't know, you can't really

1109
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,499
trust anybody out here, but he

1110
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,376
seems to be a pretty honest guy,

1111
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,043
so hopefully I'll be okay

1112
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:29,882
tonight.

1113
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,050
If I somehow win immunity or

1114
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,260
something happens, I will.

1115

>> Danni promised me she'd take

1116
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,263
me to the final two.

1117
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,099
That's a huge degree of security

1118
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,853
at the end of a crazy, crazy

1119
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:42,186
game.

1120
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,731
I think it's definitely possible

1121
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,232
that people could want to get

1122
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,150
rid of Danni at this point, but

1123
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,735
nothing could really change my

1124
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,277
mind about voting out Cindy.

1125
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,571
You know, the reward challenge

1126
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,989
was the first thing where I

1127
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,073
stepped back and was, like,

1128
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,908
whoa.

1129
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,160
Maybe I'm not going to be

1130
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,327
Cindy's biggest fan.

1131
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,537
It will come down to my powers

1132
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,748
of persuasion here, but I'm

1133
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,166
pretty sure that I can convince

1134
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,209
Steph we should vote out Cindy.

1135
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,882
>> You do?

1136
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,925
>> For sure.

1137
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,889
You know what I mean?

1138
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,932
>> Yeah.

1139
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:23,352
>> Yeah, but now if I vote off

1140
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,938
Cindy, there's another vote,

1141
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:26,898
I'm not going to get Jamie's,

1142
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,232
Judd's or Cindy's, if I get the

1143
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,233
two.

1144
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,318
>> Wait. Did you make a deal

1145
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,319
with Cindy?

1146
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,697
>> No.

1147
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,323
I mean, I told her that I was

1148
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,282
pretty sure that we were

1149
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,283
sticking together, me and you

1150
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,787
and her.

1151
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,164
It seems like Rafe is leaning

1152
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:43,748
towards getting rid of Cindy,

1153
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,249
and I told him I felt

1154
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,709
really bad because we already

1155
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,335
turned on Judd, and Cindy is in

1156
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,337
our alliance, and now we're

1157
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:49,921
going to be turning on Cindy,

1158
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:50,546
and now I don't know if this is

1159
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,215
gonna make me look worse,

1160
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,674
because Cindy just took me on

1161
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,009
a reward, and this might be

1162
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,260
another vote I could lose when

1163
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,764
it comes time for the jury.

1164
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,973
But the same time, she's a huge

1165
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,433
threat in this game, and she

1166
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,434
knows it, and she has a car at

1167
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,435
least.

1168
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,646
So, I don't know what's going to

1169
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:13,653
happen. I don't know.

1170
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,071
Earlier today, I was, like...

1171
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,114
talking about, Danni, right?

1172
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,825
And he's like, "I was," but

1173
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,785
he's like, " We kind of think

1174
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,911
that Cindy is a bigger threat

1175
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,162
because he'd rather go up

1176
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,208
against Danni.

1177
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,626
For some reason, they think

1178
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:33,297
like you're this huge threat.

1179
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,715
Right, well he knows that,

1180
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,051
but....

1181
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,219
>> When I was on the reward

1182
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,720
Stephenie, we talked about

1183
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,847
eliminating Danni, but now I

1184
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,224
know Rafe is more of a threat

1185
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,183
than anyone, so if I could get

1186
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,143
rid of Rafe, I think that would

1187
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,144
be to my benefit.

1188
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,146
I think the girls were having a

1189
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,189
much better shot at, you know,

1190
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:54,610
winning this.

1191
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,028
Danni, just so you know, voting

1192
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,613
me out tonight, you're keeping

1193
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,365
in your strongest competitor

1194
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,366
right there.

1195
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,159
He's going to beat you guys in

1196
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:02,577
all the challenges.

1197
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,745
I know you guys think I'm a

1198
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,413
threat because I've won a couple

1199
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,958
of them, but he's just going to

1200
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:09,876
beat you guys in the challenges

1201
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,334
and then vote you out.

1202
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,962
>> I know he's the strongest.

1203
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,922
>> He can beat any of us in the

1204
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,923
immunity.

1205
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:16,757
We already know that.

1206
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,925
>> Yeah.

1207
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,467
There's nothing he can't do.

1208
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,596
Smartest thing would be to

1209
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,513
eliminate him.

1210
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,100
Have all girls go to the final

1211
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:29,145
four.

1212
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,969
>> PROBST: I'll now bring in the

1213
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,138
members of our jury.

1214
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:07,350
Bobby John, Jamie, Gary and

1215
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,393
Judd, voted out at the last

1216
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,437
Tribal Council.

1217
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:16,317
Okay, it's day 36.

1218
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,487
There are five of you left.

1219
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,155
Steph's going to be one of the

1220
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,948
final four.

1221
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:22,823
One other person is going home

1222
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,658
tonight.

1223
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,451
Rafe, what was the mood like at

1224
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,661
camp this afternoon?

1225
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,371
>> I think everyone's feeling

1226
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,497
threatened right now.

1227
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,707
Except Steph, who has the

1228
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,251
immunity idol, and there's four

1229
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,294
guys in a row on the jury, and

1230
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,504
I'm the last guy here, so I

1231
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,505
certainly was feeling threatened

1232
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,590
around camp today, too.

1233
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,342
>> PROBST: Danni, what is the

1234
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,677
temperature back at camp, in

1235
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,096
terms of paranoia, or stick to

1236
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,722
whatever plan you have?

1237
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,599
>> Well, I felt uneasy since the

1238
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,851
merge because, number-wise, I've

1239
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,603
always been the odd man out, so

1240
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,938
I always feel worried.

1241
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,773
I mean, I'm so lucky to be here,

1242
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,608
I mean, to be if the final five.

1243
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,069
>> PROBST: Cindy, at the reward

1244
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,988
challenge, you win the car

1245
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,364
reward, and I tell you that in

1246
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,241
ten seasons, the person who has

1247
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,742
won that reward has never won

1248
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,286
the game, and I give you a

1249
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,996
chance to give it up and get rid

1250
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,414
of that curse, and also gain

1251
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,415
favor by giving everybody else a

1252
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,416
car.

1253
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,333
You say no, I'm keeping it, and

1254
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,627
I'm going to win the game.

1255
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,295
Still feel confident you can

1256
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,922
break that curse, keep that car

1257
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,506
and win the million bucks?

1258
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,675
>> Well, I don't feel like I

1259
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,342
made the wrong decision because

1260
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,552
in this game, there's no

1261
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,428
guarantees.

1262
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,346
They could very likely vote you

1263
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,973
out the next day after you gave

1264
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,182
them a car, then you're left

1265
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,225
with nothing.

1266
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,560
So I thought the curse thing was

1267
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,145
silly, that if you win the car,

1268
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:34,687
you're not going to win a

1269
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,105
million dollars.

1270
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:36,689
The curse is being a strong

1271
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,774
competitor and winning thing,

1272
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,483
regardless of what it is, a car,

1273
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,484
a pile of cookies, whatever it

1274
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,485
is.

1275
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,486
If you are a tough competitor,

1276
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,362
that's your curse.

1277
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,531
I don't think it has anything to

1278
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,532
do with the car.

1279
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,242
So, I'm totally content with the

1280
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,243
decision that I made.

1281
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:50,536
I think I made the right one.

1282
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,830
>> PROBST: Who here do you think

1283
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,582
is-is competitive?

1284
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,499
Who else should have a target on

1285
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,500
their back?

1286
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,752
>> As far as the competition, I

1287
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,171
think Rafe is the one that

1288
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,255
people should be most concerned

1289
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,256
about.

1290
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,299
We all have seen him win

1291
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,508
challenge after challenge,

1292
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,801
whether it's physical or mental,

1293
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,678
so he's good at everything, and

1294
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,180
people like him.

1295
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,015
So, there you go.

1296
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,475
That's the complete package.

1297
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,477
>> PROBST: Okay, Steph, you have

1298
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,811
the immunity necklace, just to

1299
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,355
make sure-- you're keeping it?

1300
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,356
>> I'm keeping it.

1301
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,775
>> PROBST: Okay, Steph is the

1302
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,109
only person you cannot vote for.

1303
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:22,651
Everybody else is fair game.

1304
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,444
It is time to vote.

1305
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,488
Cindy, you're up.

1306
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,207
>> You're just a tough

1307
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,750
competitor in all walks of

1308
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,794
competition, and, dang it,

1309
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,837
people just like you.

1310
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,347
>> What a terrific person you

1311
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,681
are, but you're very athletic,

1312
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,557
very competitive and very

1313
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,685
intelligent, and I'm voting with

1314
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,729
the tribe.

1315
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,820
>> Cindy, I've always known

1316
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,279
you'd vote whichever way the

1317
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,240
wind was blowing in a game where

1318
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,241
I'm the biggest threat and it's

1319
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,575
always blowing towards me.

1320

You need to bring me your torch.

>> I'll think about you guys

1341
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,048
when I see the stars through my

1342
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,509

two immunity challenges, one

1351
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,743
winner.

million dollars.

sole survivor.

1372
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,915
>> I think the one thing I'll

1373
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,583
miss the most is the sounds of

1374
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,001
the jungle.

1375
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,294
The cicadas, the birds, the

1376

howler monkeys, the frogs that

1377
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,298
literally is nature's orchestra.

1378

So, yeah, I didn't win the

00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,301
million bucks, but I've got

1380
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,594
memories that are priceless.

1381
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,595
There are no dollar signs on

1382
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,596
things that I'm gonna have in my
