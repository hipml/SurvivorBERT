1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,627
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,880
<i>Survivor:</i> The Boran and
Samburu tribes merged into one.

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,718
The ten of you have now merged
into one tribe.

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,096
The first individual immunity
challenge was an arm's length

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:18,101
test of endurance.
After more than six hours,

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,271
Clarence and Teresa were the
last two standing.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:28,570
A game of rock, paper, scissors
finally determined the outcome.

8
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:34,117
The new tribe bonded over wine,
and named themselves Motomaji.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,620
At Tribal Council, Teresa
secretly honored her word and

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,749
voted with Clarence against Lex.
Two votes Lex.

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,085
But Clarence received the
majority and was voted out of

12
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,629
the tribe.
The tribe has spoken.

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,258
Nine are left.
Tonight one more will go.

14
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,375
>> I'm telling you, a dirty
chicken.

15
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,460
>> When we went to Tribal
Council last night, we seemed to

16
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,088
have kind of a unanimous
consensus.

17
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,298
Everyone was going to be voting
for Clarence and then there were

18
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,509
two votes that came in with my
name and them, and I was, you

19
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,053
know, I was really surprised.
I kind of figured that Clarence

20
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,221
would vote for me, but when the
second vote came in, I was

21
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,515
pissed off.
I was furious.

22
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,225
>> I know it's not me.
It's not you.

23
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,353
It's not Tom for sure.
>> Nope.

24
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,231
>> It's not Ethan.
>> It's not Ethan.

25
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,234
The person that threw that vote
at me and that now chooses to

26
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,529
hide, torques me and it pisses
me off that I can't figure it

27
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,406
out and smoke him out right
away.

28
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,283
I will not live with a snake.
>> Yeah.

29
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,786
>> I will cut the head off of
whoever it is that did this, and

30
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,414
whoever it is that has poisoned
this with scheming and lying is

31
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,125
going to go down next.
>> Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,461
>> That is just the way it is,
and I'm going to take him out.

33
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:55,383
I'm going to slit their throats.
>> This morning Lex was just a

34
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,802
total jerk.
I mean what do you expect in

35
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,554
this game?
I mean I'm sorry.

36
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,388
Someone voted against you,
Mr. Ego.

37
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,599
Deal with it.
>> It was not me.

38
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,475
>> You swear on your brother?
You'd swear on your brother's

39
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,311
name?
>> I'd swear on my brother's

40
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,272
name.
I'd swear on both my parents.

41
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,441
I really would.
I'll look you in the eye.

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,109
>> You are?
>> I am, I am.

43
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,402
I promise you.
>> Okay, it really wasn't me,

44
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:18,323
but screw you, Lex, if you're
going to sit here and yell at me

45
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,451
like you're my dad and I'm five
and I just stole cookies for

46
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,579
something I didn't do.
>> Did you sleep well?

47
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,749
>> I did.
I'm a pretty happy camper.

48
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,252
>> This one little vote is so
inconsequential to the game, and

49
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,422
it has so much to do with Lex's
ego that I really could care

50
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,800
less what happens with it.
Somebody was just screwing with

51
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,305
his head, and it worked.
It makes me wish I had done it.

52
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,432
>> Is there anything I can help
you with for breakfast?

53
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,018
>> I was going to try that soup.
What would you think of that?

54
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,978
>> Sure.
At this point in the game, I'm

55
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,606
worried about the fact that
there's a snake amongst us and I

56
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,317
don't know who it is.
That person could act like

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,612
cancer and start rotting,
rotting our plans from the

58
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,447
inside out.
And that's why we need to smoke

59
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,494
them out.
>> Lex was just distraught.

60
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,164
I mean it was just terrible.
He said, "All I could think

61
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,667
about was who was the one that
voted" for him, and, I mean, I

62
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,710
didn't think it would be that
much of an impact.

63
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,546
I thought, shoot, ten votes:
he got two, didn't get eight.

64
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,798
Well, what's the big deal?
He's here.

65
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:21,010
But it wasn't like that a bit.
>> I'm just not even going to...

66
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,846
I'm not even going to think
about it anymore.

67
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,809
It was because somebody around
here is claiming to be something

68
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,018
that they're not.
>> Right.

69
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,647
>> Of course they figure that
Clarence had voted him, but they

70
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,525
had to figure out who the other
person was.

71
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,487
It was me.
I mean I did it.

72
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,324
I'm sick that I did it now, but
like I said, I didn't think it

73
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,618
would be such an ordeal.
>> You know, I want, I want you

74
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,537
to know that I have, I have no
suspicion at all as far as

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,415
you're concerned and I'm just
going to let this thing go now

76
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,376
that whoever it is, is probably
going to hang themselves, and

77
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,215
that's the way it is, you know.
And I wish I knew definitively

78
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:03,094
for sure, because then I would
just take care of it, who to

79
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,929
give it next.
>> Yeah, right.

80
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,516
Mama didn't raise no fool.
I'm going to keep quiet for a

81
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,978
while longer, just because,
well, I'm not really ready

82
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,396
to go.
>> From the moment I met you,

83
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,234
I knew that I could trust you,
and I trust my gut over my, over

84
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:22,155
my eyes any day and my gut told
me that you're, you're the real

85
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,073
deal, so...
>> Thanks, Lex.

86
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,951
>> Thank you.
So...

87
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,537
>> All along I played with being
straight up with everybody, and

88
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,540
now I'm not straight up with
them for obvious reasons, and I

89
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,209
don't know where to go with it
now.

90
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,879
It bothers me.
It bothers me a lot, actually.

91
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:46,179
I hate this game.
>> Oh, one of these little,

92
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,598
weird music-makers.
♪♪

93
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,435
Okay.
>> What is it?

94
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,022
>> This is like an African
music-making device.

95
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,148
>> All right.
>> Cool.

96
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:01,069
You play with your thumbs, and
it says, "Coordination and

97
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,946
persistence it'll take to win
this one.

98
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,949
You may run out of breath, but I
guarantee you'll have some fun.

99
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,744
You best use all your leverage,
focus you don't want to miss,

100
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,579
because you haven't seen a
reward quite as cool as this."

101
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,498
Persistence and leverage.
>> Focus.

102
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,960
>> But see, leverage is kind of
like, you know, like you have to

103
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,671
push these... I don't know.
>> Lex is getting good at that

104
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,298
thing.
>> This is fun.

105
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,634
I like having this around.
You guys are going to get really

106
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:35,478
sick of this.
>> PROBST: All right, guys,

107
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:44,612
sick of this.
>> PROBST: All right, guys,

108
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,990
today's reward challenge is
going to require a bit of

109
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,867
coordination, a whole lot of
persistence.

110
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,496
You will each have nine items.
Your goal: Get the nine items

111
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,291
into the basket on top of your
tower, using your plank as a

112
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,668
springboard.
So you'll take one item at a

113
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,546
time, put it at the end of the
plank.

114
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,632
Go to the other side, stomp on
it, flinging it into the air

115
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,843
into your basket.
A little bit of wind today.

116
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,137
You'll have to adjust for.
It's trial and error.

117
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,721
The first person to get all nine
items in their basket wins the

118
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,015
reward.
Want to know what your reward

119
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,684
is?
>> Yes!

120
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,645
>> PROBST: Charles, Isaac, bring
them in.

121
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,730
You guys remember Charles from
when we drank blood?

122
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,817
This is his brother, Isaac.
>> Hi.

123
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,654
>> PROBST: The winner gets these
two goats, then in the morning,

124
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,032
we'll go to a small African
village, where you are going to

125
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,828
barter these goats for whatever
you can get: creature comforts,

126
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,706
food, souvenirs, whatever you
deem important.

127
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,666
And then the merchant who you
trade with will be able to

128
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:42,378
increase his herd of goats,
which increases his wealth.

129
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,882
All right, take your spots.
Let's get it going.

130
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:50,720
Survivors ready?
Go!

131
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:13,659
Ethan's got one.
Another one for Ethan.

132
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:18,831
Ethan's got one.
Another one for Ethan.

133
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:36,641
Kim's got one.
Lex back in.

134
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:41,979
Kim's got one.
Lex back in.

135
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,691
Another one for Ethan.
Frank's got one.

136
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,738
How's it going, Kelly?
>> I keep breaking my plank.

137
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,832
>> PROBST: Another one for Big
Tom.

138
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:08,839
Another one for Ethan.
Brandon on the board.

139
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:15,471
>> Ah!
>> You've got to be joking.

140
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:20,977
>> PROBST: Frank has his second
one in.

141
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,439
Ethan down to two.
Lex is down to three.

142
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:33,781
Brandon's down to four.
Ethan down to one.

143
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,038
Lex down to two.
Ethan, you're on your last one,

144
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:48,004
but Lex is right on your heels.
Big Tom.

145
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,132
Frank's down to four.
>> Let's move it. Come on!

146
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,720
>> Woo!
>> PROBST: Kelly, welcome to the

147
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,140
game.
Brandon needs three.

148
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:04,687
Lex needs two.
Ethan needs one.

149
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,692
There it is.
That's it, it's over,

150
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,528
Ethan wins.
>> Good job, Ethan.

151
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:17,199
>> You did great.
>> PROBST: All right, Ethan,

152
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,160
here's the deal.
I'll take good care of your

153
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,704
goats tonight.
Tomorrow morning, show up at

154
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,248
camp and take your goats.
You might want to bring a few

155
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,375
personal items, if you have
them, want to get rid of them,

156
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,835
something to barter, might have
value.

157
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,836
We'll go to a small little
village, make a day of it.

158
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,591
>> All right.
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

159
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,866
>> If that one hat gets
everybody something, just do

160
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,911
that, I don't care.
>> They'll be like, "it's the

161
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,204
hat guy."
>> Yeah.

162
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:07,792
>> Right now, everyone is giving
me some stuff to trade away at

163
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,419
the old marketplace or wherever
I end up.

164
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,881
This hat wants something sweet.
This hat might want a belt or a

165
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,426
bracelet.
This hat wants...

166
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,928
>> Anything.
>> Anything, other than this

167
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:27,937
hat.
>> Gruel.

168
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,439
>> PROBST: Yo, Ethan.
>> Yeah.

169
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,108
>> Look who's here.
>> Oh, yeah.

170
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,110
>> PROBST: How's breakfast?
>> Good.

171
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,986
We got a little gray gruel
going.

172
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,280
>> PROBST: Got a bag full of
personal stuff you're going to

173
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,907
barter?
>> Yeah, got some hats.

174
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,910
Got some sunglasses.
>> PROBST: Cool, all right.

175
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,329
>> Have a great time.
Have fun.

176
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,832
>> PROBST: You guys...
You guys want to walk him out?

177
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:53,838
>> Sure.
>> PROBST: You guys remember

178
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,922
Abi.
He welcomed you when you first

179
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,924
got here?
>> Up, up, up.

180
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:01,178
>> Down, down, down, down.
>> Later, guys.

181
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,305
Have a great day.
I'll see you.

182
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,016
>> Have a great time.
>> All right, Ethan.

183
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,935
>> Hi, goats.
>> PROBST: I want to make sure

184
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,019
you can handle those goats.
Take a seat by them and make

185
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,356
sure they're all right.
>> Come on, have a seat.

186
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,693
How do you lay down?
I'm not feeling real good about

187
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,778
this.
>> PROBST: I think you need to

188
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,323
bring one more person with you.
>> Oh.

189
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,908
>> PROBST: Grab somebody because
we've got to run.

190
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,495
>> When Jeff said, you know,
"pick somebody," my exact

191
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,331
reaction was I don't want to
choose anyone to take because

192
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,668
it's a huge political decision
and the only thing I could think

193
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,796
of quick enough was, you know,
the person that was close to

194
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,340
winning, but didn't.
Lex because he came in second

195
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,842
and that's my only clarification
for coming.

196
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,137
>> Lex, let's go.
>> Yeah!

197
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,889
Way to go.
>> Have fun, Lex.

198
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,015
>> Good choice.
>> He came in second.

199
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,350
He battled me.
>> Good choice.

200
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,395
>> Good choice.
>> If you get to trade Lex, you

201
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,690
know, you get some more stuff.
>> Good luck.

202
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:03,824
>> Bye, guys.
>> Look at that.

203
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:11,499
>> Bye, guys.
>> Look at that.

204
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:18,047
This is crazy.
>> We had to keep a couple of

205
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,718
goats calm and keep them still
because the whole point of the

206
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,596
trip was for us to take two
goats into this village and be

207
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,224
able to trade or barter them for
money so we could buy some

208
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,559
goods.
But the ride was so bumpy.

209
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,853
I mean it was an absolute
ball-buster.

210
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:40,110
>> Oh...
>> Oh, my gosh.

211
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,702
>> We finally arrived.
The town ended up being named

212
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,372
Wamba.
It was a small little village,

213
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:56,794
maybe one street, with stores on
it.

214
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,049
>> The whole thing was a surreal
experience.

215
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,426
>> I'm experiencing extreme
culture shock.

216
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,637
>> I am, too.
>> I didn't know that when we

217
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,973
got into the village, that it
would be up to Ethan and I to

218
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:13,602
actually get the goats off.
We got to get the goats.

219
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,397
>> This is going to be pure
comedy.

220
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:25,447
>> No, it's not that bad.
>> We already had a crowd of the

221
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,994
locals, you know, watching two
very out-of-place guys chucking

222
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,205
goats out of huge trucks.
We were the laughingstock before

223
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,167
we even set foot in the village.
Now, you won this, right?

224
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,211
This was like, this was, this
was a reward, right?

225
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,630
>> Yeah, it was.
Yeah, it was.

226
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,966
>> This is not a punishment or a
hazing.

227
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,553
>> I know nothing about goats,
and I was looking around for

228
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:55,019
some sort of hint, some sort of
direction, and just got nothing.

229
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,146
Everyone is staring at us, and
you're definitely in the hot

230
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,064
seat.
>> We don't stand out, though,

231
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,650
do we?
>> No, not at all.

232
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,986
>> I was panicked.
I had no idea what to do.

233
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:09,491
We just started shopping them
around.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,995
>> I'm selling a goat.
Are you interested in buying a

235
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,331
goat?
$1,500.

236
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,459
$1,000?
>> I'll give you 500 each.

237
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,004
>> 500 each?
>> Oh, no, no, no.

238
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,381
They know where they're going.
I'm selling a goat.

239
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:28,218
Anybody interested?
Somebody already offered us

240
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,514
1,000 for this one.
Do you want to buy a goat?

241
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,684
You know who wants to buy goats?
>> No.

242
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,186
>> He'll grow.
He's just young.

243
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,356
He's a baby.
>> You want to sell the small

244
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,274
one?
>> We want to sell them both.

245
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,401
1,800.
>> 1,800 is too much money.

246
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:50,366
12, four, 16.
>> The best we've gotten so far.

247
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,283
>> Okay.
Thank you.

248
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,079
>> Thank you.
>> Want to see where they're

249
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,082
taking the goats?
They're going to take the goats

250
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:02,586
somewhere and get 2,000.
>> We could have got attached to

251
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,214
the goats on that 3h-hour trip.
I thought maybe they were going

252
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,217
to end up in a flock and they
were going to be these happy

253
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,219
goats that kind of, you know,
cruise around the countryside

254
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,555
eating grass and maybe mating or
whatever.

255
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,059
We saw him turn around with the
two goats and he made a beeline,

256
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,728
not 20 feet away from us
straight into the butchery.

257
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,023
>> Oh, they got a good deal.
>> Be that as it may, we had 25

258
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:28,195
bucks to spend.
(crowing)

259
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,709
>> We were clearly a couple of
things to see in that village.

260
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,252
We had a constant kind of
entourage that followed us

261
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,422
around, many of which weren't
even talking to us.

262
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:52,302
They were just staring at us.
Somebody from the village,

263
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,222
obviously the guy that's in the
know, or hooked up with

264
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,600
everybody, immediately latched
on to us and said, "I can take

265
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,311
you to the best place in town."
>> Is it good food?

266
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,605
>> Yeah, good food.
A good restaurant there.

267
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,152
>> All right.
>> We're going to be eating

268
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,404
here.
We sat down, and asked for a

269
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,614
menu.
They didn't have a menu, but the

270
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:17,453
guy basically told us, "Yeah, we
have three things here."

271
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,121
The maize we didn't want
anything to do with because

272
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,956
that's the mush we're
eating here.

273
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,250
Meat we weren't feeling super
safe about because we saw a lot

274
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,503
of cats kind of milling around.
We weren't quite sure what that

275
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,964
meant.
And then French fries sounded, I

276
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,174
mean, right off the bat that
sounded great.

277
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:36,764
>> Two chips and then a big
soda, beer.

278
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:43,145
Thank you.
>> This is incredible.

279
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,198
>> I got a soda and Lex got a
beer.

280
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,326
>> Thank you very much.
>> And it was cold and it was

281
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,952
crisp.
>> Cheers.

282
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,872
>> Thank you for the trip.
>> No problem.

283
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,378
>> Oh, yes.
This is the best French fries

284
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:13,175
I've ever had in my life.
The platters were huge.

285
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,678
They were swimming in about an
eighth of an inch of, like,

286
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:21,016
grease or oil, which was perfect
because I have gone without fat

287
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:25,479
or lard or grease for a month.
And I'm telling you, it was like

288
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,689
ambrosia.
Are you all right?

289
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,399
>> Yeah.
>> I think the French fries were

290
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:33,862
a definite shock to my system.
I mean my stomach has shrunk

291
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,241
significantly.
I don't regret it, but you know,

292
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:49,211
it went right through me.
It's like solitary confinement.

293
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,088
I wouldn't want to go there
again.

294
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,382
That's for sure.
But you had to do it, you know,

295
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,219
you can't not do it.
Oh, my God.

296
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,722
>> Oh, yeah.
My stomach hasn't felt full in a

297
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,184
long time out here.
The feeling was great.

298
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,896
Next on our agenda was trying to
find sweets and goods for the

299
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,568
tribe.
You'll be fair with us, right?

300
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:17,030
>> Yes, sure, I will be.
Make you happy, also.

301
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,367
>> We went to a marketplace.
Unfortunately, after our

302
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,078
thousand-shilling meal, we were
only left with about 600

303
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:27,249
shillings to get a whole bunch
of stuff for the tribe.

304
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:33,881
>> This is nice, dude.
>> You got a good one there.

305
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,259
>> I have sunglasses.
>> Sunglasses?

306
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,763
Yeah.
>> That's nice.

307
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,266
I don't really need that.
But, yeah, maybe.

308
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,684
Just hold on to it.
Maybe.

309
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:53,442
You just let me know.
This, this, this, for two hats.

310
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,403
>> I was bartering and you know,
I was trying to get a lot for

311
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,405
a hat.
>> So all I have is this and

312
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,616
this.
>> Would she want this one, you

313
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,076
think?
>> Oh, and I have this shirt.

314
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,955
I traded right off my back one
of my Reebok long-sleeved

315
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,084
T-shirts.
They gave me a price, and I gave

316
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:15,464
them my shirt off my back.
I gave them my hat off my head.

317
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,635
For even just two hours, I was a
little bit part of their life

318
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:25,849
and see how things work.
I had brought this hacky sack as

319
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,352
my luxury item and I'm, like,
you know, "When am I going to

320
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,437
use this?"
And so we just started, you

321
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,607
know, kicking it around and
playing.

322
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,442
Three, four, five.
I'm sure they're, like, how the

323
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,529
hell does this kid know how to
do this, you know, because I'm

324
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,866
sure they don't see many white
people that can play soccer or

325
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:49,289
hacky sack.
>> You know what his name is?

326
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,583
Ethan.
Back in the United States, he's

327
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,170
a soccer player.
>> The smiles on their faces

328
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,506
were, you know, amazing.
And I think I made their day.

329
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,466
And then as we were leaving, I,
you know, I threw it to one of

330
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,220
the little ones and I gave him
my hacky sack and he was, like,

331
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,138
"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank
you."

332
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,517
It's hard to describe in words
everything that was going on in

333
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,355
my head and in my body.
But, like, it was an experience

334
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,440
that, you know, I'll never be
able to forget.

335
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,860
>> Thank you.
That was business.

336
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,031
That was insane.
As a life experience, it was a

337
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:28,537
day I will never, ever forget,
like, for the rest of my life.

338
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,498
Look, they're all wearing our
hats and stuff.

339
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,585
>> Bye!
Bye!

340
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:57,399
>> I hadn't told anybody yet
that I voted for Lex, and I

341
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,318
won't anytime soon.
>> Everywhere you turn, a little

342
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:05,240
bit of scheming going on.
>> It did work well with Lex

343
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,242
gone.
So it's allowed us to do things

344
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:12,456
that I don't think would have
happened if he had stayed.

345
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,250
>> This is going to be so much
fun, just kind of satisfying.

346
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,754
>> Believe it or not, God bless
her, Teresa has apparently

347
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,424
gathered Kim and Brandon back
under the original Samburu

348
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,927
wings, two individuals I can't
put any trust in, but at this

349
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,930
point in the game, I really have
not much of a choice.

350
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,641
So I think it'll be a major
D-day invasion going on.

351
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,103
>> If we're going to make a
move, it has to be this Tribal

352
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,605
Council.
It has to be, because this is

353
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:41,318
our only chance.
>> Right.

354
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:49,242
>> The downside of going on a
reward challenge and being away

355
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,454
for the whole day is, you know,
people have a chance to plot

356
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,624
against you, say good things
about you, bad things about you.

357
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,459
>> I don't see how the rewards
can get that much better.

358
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,295
>> I know.
>> At this stage of the game,

359
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,922
you don't want to piss anyone
off.

360
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,091
You know, we didn't want to go
there and say, "Oh, it was the

361
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,176
greatest thing ever and you guys
didn't get to do it."

362
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,970
>> Did you have fun?
>> We want to hear about it.

363
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,138
Come on in.
>> Was it awesome?

364
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,473
>> Was it a lot of fun?
>> We wanted to be sensitive to

365
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,809
the fact that it was probably
tough for them to be left behind

366
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,977
while we went off and had a
really great time and ate a

367
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,146
bunch of food when they were
eating, you know, a tiny portion

368
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,484
of mush.
>> We even got you guys treats.

369
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,319
>> Everyone gets two.
>> Oh!

370
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,321
>> Santa Claus.
Santa Claus.

371
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,656
>> That tastes like coconut.
>> That's very good.

372
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,491
>> I just sucked it out.
It was so good.

373
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,370
>> Getting a treat like that out
here, particularly something

374
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:37,457
sweet that we've been craving,
was just, like, the best gift.

375
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,584
>> 33 cookies each.
>> Oh!

376
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,964
>> Oh, my God!
>> Did you carry all that back?

377
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,341
Oh, my God, thank you so much.
>> You are amazing.

378
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,676
>> Thank you.
>> Ethan made them look so good.

379
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,679
He deserved every bit of credit
he got for bringing those

380
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,057
cookies back.
>> Ethan, we love you so much.

381
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,518
>> Thank you so much.
These are fabulous.

382
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,981
>> Mmm.
>> These are good.

383
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,028
>> Good?
>> That feels great.

384
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,864
Thank you, Frank.
Okay, do you know where you're

385
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,992
going?
>> Oh, no, my shorts.

386
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,744
>> Okay, this is what I gather.
T told me that you're correct.

387
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,581
Lex does think you voted for
him.

388
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,708
>> I refuse to spend my time
here kissing up to him,

389
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,419
trying to convince him I didn't
vote against him.

390
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,588
>> He might not be around.
>> I was trying to work a little

391
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,382
bit on Kelly, in seeing whether
or not she might come and vote

392
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,718
with us because she is really
kind of upset with Lex, but I

393
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,220
don't want to push her too hard.
So I'm waiting to see what

394
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,597
happens at the immunity
challenge.

395
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,682
>> I'm not going to say that
would make me sad, but after

396
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,601
what happened last time I'm kind
of gun-shy about...

397
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,603
>> Kim-- she kind of asked me to
vote with them, and I said no, I

398
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,398
have to vote with my tribe, but,
you know, best of luck with your

399
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,066
little coup and we'll see what
happens.

400
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,901
Are you sure Frank's not in
on that?

401
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,903
>> Yeah, Frank's definitely in
on this.

402
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,738
Kelly said she wasn't going to
vote for Lex, but I think

403
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,032
there's part of her that does
want to vote with us because she

404
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,534
doesn't want Lex to be around.
>> That's thinking with your

405
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,578
head.
>> Everything lays on the next

406
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,247
immunity challenge.
I mean, if Lex wins it, it's

407
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,124
kind of back to game over
for us.

408
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:11,301
So everything lays on that.
>> PROBST: How's it going, guys?

409
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:20,727
So everything lays on that.
>> PROBST: How's it going, guys?

410
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,270
>> Great.
>> Good.

411
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,648
>> PROBST: First things first.
Teresa, I hate to take it back,

412
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,399
but...
>> You got to do what you got

413
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,776
to do.
>> PROBST: Did you like having

414
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,319
that?
>> I loved having it.

415
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,154
>> PROBST: Immunity back up for
grabs today.

416
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,115
For today's challenge, I want
you to guys to line up short in

417
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,451
front, tall in back.
I want to show you something.

418
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,453
Just right behind those rocks.
Everybody ready?

419
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,830
You have 30 seconds to study
these items.

420
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:46,670
Carefully memorize the placement
of each item.

421
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:51,883
Make sure you can see every box.
If you can't, move so you can.

422
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:58,265
Five, four, three, two, one.
Head to your barrels.

423
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,767
Everybody lift the lid off of
your barrels.

424
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,854
Take a look at your grid inside.
Think of this like a phone pad,

425
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,650
going across from left to right
is one through nine.

426
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,027
So one is in your upper
left-hand corner.

427
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,322
Five is in the middle.
Nine is in the bottom right.

428
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,992
On my start, I'm going to give
you an item.

429
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,495
You need to find that item, come
back with it, and get it in the

430
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,998
right spot in order to move on
to the next round.

431
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,001
Everything you need is 150 feet
out that way.

432
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:30,547
This is for immunity.
On my start, we're looking for

433
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,341
item number seven.
Survivors ready?

434
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:43,435
Go!
All right, Brandon, peel it back

435
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:52,819
Go!
All right, Brandon, peel it back

436
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,530
this way.
Let's see what you got.

437
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,324
You got it, a leaf and a seed
pod.

438
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,493
You're good.
Peel it back.

439
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,912
No, that's wrong, Frank.
You're done.

440
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:11,379
You're good.
You're good.

441
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,717
Sorry, Kim.
You're missing the leaf.

442
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,891
You're good.
You're good.

443
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,768
You're missing the seed pod.
You're out.

444
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,103
>> Really?
>> PROBST: Yep.

445
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:33,401
>> Shoot.
>> PROBST: You're good.

446
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,237
Here we go, guys.
Next item, number two.

447
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,617
Survivors ready?
Go!

448
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,796
All right, Brandon.
That's right, elephant dung.

449
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,340
Nice job.
>> Thank you.

450
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,760
>> PROBST: You're still alive.
Let's see what you got, Kelly.

451
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,888
No, it wasn't a rock.
>> I know what it was, too.

452
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:08,061
>> PROBST: Oh, Lex...
size does matter.

453
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,272
No, that's wrong.
I'm sorry, Teresa.

454
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,858
You're out.
>> PROBST: Big Tom, you've seen

455
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,944
that before.
Yep, you're good.

456
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,864
All right, Ethan.
Yep.

457
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,576
Brandon, Lex, Tom, Ethan, for
our final round, I have a whole

458
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,787
new barrel of items.
I want you to come in close,

459
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,624
take a look.
You guys have 15 seconds to

460
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:38,716
study these items.
Five, four, three, two, one.

461
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,303
Head back to your barrels.
Okay, guys, on my start, you

462
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,433
have exactly one minute to find
as many of the items as you can.

463
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,477
The person back with the most
items wins immunity and cannot

464
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,646
be voted out at tonight's Tribal
Council.

465
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:52,814
Survivors ready?
Go!

466
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:58,445
You have one minute.
You want to grab some, put them

467
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,156
in and go back out, you can.
Shove them in your pocket.

468
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,742
Whatever works.
For immunity, guys.

469
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,994
Pick it up.
30 seconds.

470
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,998
You'd better hustle, Brandon.
If you got them, get them in.

471
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,958
Hurry up, Big Tom.
Start wrapping it up.

472
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,962
Ten seconds.
Five, four, three...

473
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,340
get it in the barrel...
two, one.

474
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,051
That's it, you're done.
All right, Brandon, open that

475
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,637
baby up.
Let's see what you got here.

476
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,641
You got one, two...
you got three, four...

477
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,394
You got five.
Brandon has six.

478
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:36,608
Six is the number to beat.
You got two.

479
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,194
You got three.
You got four.

480
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:43,072
You got five.
Sorry, Lex.

481
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,700
Brandon's still the number to
beat with six.

482
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:51,039
Big Tom, you got one, two, three
four, five, six.

483
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,916
This is not right.
You're still alive with six.

484
00:29:52,999 --> 00:30:01,841
Big Tom and Brandon at six.
Ethan, you have one, two, three,

485
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,929
four, five, six, seven and
eight.

486
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,224
>> Nice!
>> Ethan wins immunity.

487
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:13,186
Congratulations.
>> Good job, Ethan.

488
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,355
>> PROBST: It's yours, buddy.
Nice job.

489
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,564
Congratulations.
>> Thank you.

490
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,025
>> PROBST: You cannot be voted
out at tonight's Tribal Council.

491
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,861
The rest of you guys have the
afternoon to think about it.

492
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,782
I'll see you tonight for another
vote.

493
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,558
>> Don't worry about it.
>> Please.

494
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,767
>> Don't worry about it.
>> All right.

495
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,437
The last three days, since our
last Tribal Council, have been

496
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,148
pretty interesting.
There was that mystery vote, and

497
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,443
my goal was in three days to
figure out who it was that cast

498
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:07,949
that vote.
After putting two and two

499
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,411
together, gathering a lot of
information, kind of observing

500
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:16,291
things, it became really evident
that my worst fears were more

501
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,501
and more likely than not
were true.

502
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,502
>> Tom?
>> Yeah.

503
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,129
>> Hey, I had a shift with
Brandon this morning.

504
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,299
>> Yeah?
>> And he heard Kelly talking to

505
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,469
Frank and T-bird and he
distinctly heard her say the

506
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,014
words "free agent."
>> Free agent.

507
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:35,310
>> Yeah, there is absolutely no
doubt in my mind now that

508
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,145
Kelly's turning.
>> That she's the rat?

509
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,064
We're shooting a harpoon shot
that it's Kelly.

510
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:45,320
It's hard for me to go against
my tribe mate, and I like little

511
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,822
Kelly, but all indications is
it's her.

512
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:51,117
But we really haven't gotten
anything concrete on that.

513
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,871
>> So I talked to Brandon.
I said, "Look, I would like you

514
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,332
to take Kelly's spot as our
fifth member.

515
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,335
You will be the fifth one from
the top."

516
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:06,007
My gut tells me, without doubt,
that I can trust him.

517
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,052
You know my gut is good.
>> Right, so far it's been

518
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,304
pretty good.
Lex is putting his trust in

519
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,348
Brandon.
I didn't really get to

520
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,351
interrogate Kelly enough to make
sure she's that rat.

521
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:20,938
Everything points to her, but I
will feel like hell if we have

522
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:25,360
kicked one of our own team
members off over Lex's gut

523
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,696
feeling.
All right, well, then how will

524
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,240
the vote go?
How will we do it?

525
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:36,537
>> Me, you, Ethan...
>> Kim, Johnson and Brandon,

526
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,415
five.
So I say we cut Kelly off

527
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,709
tonight.
It all fits.

528
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,378
That's why we have to take her
out tonight.

529
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,172
>> If his gut feeling ain't
right, we've done Kelly an

530
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,716
injustice and we've done ourself
an injustice.

531
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,346
>> Are you sure?
>> I'm sure.

532
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:05,066
>> Ever since the immunity
challenge, things have been very

533
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,317
different, different than
they've ever been before.

534
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,612
Lex hasn't been laying down the
orders of who I'm supposed to

535
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,239
vote for, who we're supposed to
vote for, so I have no clue

536
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,909
really what's going on.
>> You want to know what's going

537
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,285
on?
>> Well, yeah.

538
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,414
>> Well, we've kind of...
we've hit an impasse.

539
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,916
>> I can tell.
>> I've made a commitment to

540
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,210
myself to try to... that by the
time the third day came, I was

541
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:28,256
going to try to sniff out the
rat and whoever that was, that's

542
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,968
who would get my vote.
Now, if that means that we're,

543
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,638
that we're splintering at this
point, so be it.

544
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,099
But I... you know, it doesn't
seem that alliances are what

545
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,935
they used to be.
>> I don't know.

546
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:43,104
I thought, you know...
I mean, whatever.

547
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,732
If everyone's made up their mind
then that's fine.

548
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,943
The whole thing about the vote
against you wasn't me, so if

549
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:52,280
that would be anyone's reason to
vote against me, I would really

550
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,407
hope there was more to it than
that.

551
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,325
>> It's going to be what it's
going to be.

552
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,828
So...
>> All right.

553
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,663
>> Okay?
>> My butt is on the line

554
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,416
because, you know, my own
teammates are all trying to turn

555
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,960
against me, and I'm just, like,
"This is ridiculous."

556
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:09,756
I feel like my only real
strategy is to try to defect and

557
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,091
team up with the four from
Samburu.

558
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,301
>> Are you okay?
>> Oh, I'm fine.

559
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,094
I don't even know what's
going on.

560
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,637
They're just like, "We don't
want to have an alliance

561
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,181
anymore."
Everyone wants to vote for

562
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,807
different people.
Okay, then we can all vote our

563
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,142
own way.
>> That's fine, I mean.

564
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,144
>> Then I'll vote for Lex.
>> I'll vote for Lex, too.

565
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,353
>> You have my word.
I'll vote for Lex.

566
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,606
>> If I change for any reason,
I will come and let you know.

567
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,942
But I'll try and work on T-bird.
All right, I'll let you know.

568
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,238
>> We've got Kelly.
I don't know that I trust Kelly,

569
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,616
but at this point, I don't have
a choice not to.

570
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,284
She's our only hope.
>> Are you sure?

571
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:43,873
>> I'm positive.
I'm positive.

572
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,125
>> You don't want to go with
Kelly.

573
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,127
You don't trust her long-term,
do you?

574
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,670
>> Yes.
>> Are you sure?

575
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,964
>> Positive.
>> We have to get Lex out

576
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,218
because it's Kelly, me, Brandon,
you Frank, you know, gone.

577
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,554
>> If we don't all do it,
it's not going to work.

578
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,015
It won't work.
>> I know.

579
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:06,062
I know.
>> Brandon's absolutely sure?

580
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,315
>> He's definitely in.
If it changes, I will let you

581
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,486
know.
>> Man.

582
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,741
I can trust you, right?
>> Yes.

583
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:28,417
>> Yeah, I know that.
>> My old team is looking for me

584
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,212
to do what we talked about
yesterday, which is vote

585
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,922
for Lex.
But then again, Lex flat out

586
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,383
told me this morning that they
wanted me to vote Kelly off

587
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,551
tonight.
Now I'm feeling like I'm in a

588
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,512
power play position and that
wasn't what I had planned and

589
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,557
it's very awkward for me and I
don't know what I'm

590
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,685
going to do yet.
I honestly don't know.

591
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,931
>> PROBST: Welcome.
Looking forward to another good

592
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,807
Tribal Council.
Ethan...

593
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,809
>> Yeah?
>> PROBST: This is sort of your

594
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,269
week.
>> Yeah, it happened to be a

595
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,270
good week for me.
>> PROBST: You're dominating

596
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,272
everything.
Let's talk about the reward.

597
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,817
A scale of one to ten, how good
of an experience was that?

598
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,445
>> It was a ten, for sure, one
of the best days of my life.

599
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,406
And a day I'll never forget and
no one can take that away from

600
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,284
me, no matter what happens in
the game.

601
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,162
>> PROBST: Tom, what does go on
when two people leave?

602
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,122
What kind of a void does that
create?

603
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:52,460
>> There's more talking, you
know, among different people.

604
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,504
The circles are not as tight,
and it was a day that everybody

605
00:36:55,588 --> 00:37:00,134
was running around like a
chicken with their head cut off,

606
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:03,095
talking to everybody.
And so I didn't know what to

607
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,264
think.
So it was definitely different.

608
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,100
>> PROBST: Kim, did the thought
occur to you, you know, what,

609
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,645
maybe I don't want to go on a
reward because as Tom said,

610
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,939
there's a lot of talking that
goes on at camp.

611
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,358
Maybe that's more important, to
be there?

612
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,525
>> Yeah, you know, you do think
about it.

613
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,820
But I don't think that anybody
really would say that they'd

614
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,198
want to give up a reward and
just stay there and see, you

615
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,866
know, what was going on in camp
life.

616
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,285
I mean, it's so important to us
to win rewards and it's such a

617
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,412
great experience.
What they did was so amazing.

618
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,290
It's not, it's not like you
would miss that much in camp

619
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,000
life.
>> PROBST: Let's talk about last

620
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,504
week's vote.
Lex, surprised to get votes?

621
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,547
>> I was pretty surprised to get
a couple of votes, and it was

622
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,051
definitely something that
occupied a lot of my, a lot of

623
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,345
my thoughts the last three days.
>> PROBST: Why were you

624
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,681
surprised?
Because normally when I ask you

625
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,557
guys, everybody says, "Oh, I
really feel vulnerable tonight.

626
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,019
It certainly could be my night."
And yet when you get a vote,

627
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,688
it's like, "Who the hell voted
for me?"

628
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,982
>> Well, I think that's just a
natural reaction.

629
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,901
Everybody feels vulnerable here,
but that doesn't mean that you

630
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,862
expect to get votes.
And yet when you see your name

631
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,992
on one of those little cards, I
mean, it changes everything.

632
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,203
It's hard.
But yeah, the burning question

633
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,580
was: "Who wrote my name down on
the paper?"

634
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,334
>> PROBST: Well, you guys have
made it a long ways.

635
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,254
24 days, you're down to a
one-in-nine shot at a million

636
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:21,048
bucks at this point.
Let's find out who's out of the

637
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,717
game.
It's time to vote.

638
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:36,188
Lex, you're up first.
>> Kelly, if I'm wrong about

639
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:40,526
you, then I apologize, but I
smell a rat, and my gut tells me

640
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,571
that you stabbed me in the back,
and you're playing both sides.

641
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:48,951
And if that's the case, then
good riddance.

642
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:04,383
>> When it's me, you'll know it.
I couldn't be more excited to be

643
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,261
casting this vote.
I never wanted you to win, and

644
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,930
now I hope you won't.
If this is the last vote I cast,

645
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,767
then at least I got a vote for
you, who I've always found to be

646
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:22,860
not fun to be around.
>> This is a kicker.

647
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:41,670
not fun to be around.
>> This is a kicker.

648
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:45,591
I made a promise to Lex that I
would vote this way tonight, and

649
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:50,679
I'm probably going to bite it,
but I really am doing it to make

650
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:56,268
it to the final four at least.
So, um, sorry, Kelly.

651
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,358
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

652
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,662
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

653
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,123
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area

654
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,166
immediately.
Before I get to the vote, I just

655
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,544
want to remind you guys that,
beginning tonight, the person

656
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,546
voted out of the tribe does not
leave the game.

657
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,674
They will return and be a part
of the jury and will have a huge

658
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,844
impact on the outcome.
You're about to vote somebody

659
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,973
out of this game and then ask
them to vote for you to win.

660
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:42,815
I'll read the votes.
First vote: Kelly.

661
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:54,618
Kelly.
Lex.

662
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,041
Lex.
Two votes: Lex;

663
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:09,675
two votes: Kelly.
Lex.

664
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,511
Kelly.
Three votes Lex;

665
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:21,687
three votes Kelly.
It's four votes Lex.

666
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:26,567
Four votes Kelly.
We're tied, four votes each.

667
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:32,239
Lex and Kelly.
The last vote.

668
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,908
Kelly.
>> Oh, no.

669
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,576
>> PROBST: You need to bring me
your torch.

670
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:50,633
>> All right.
>> Live it up.

671
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:57,431
>> PROBST: Kelly, the tribe has
spoken.

672
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:06,565
It's time for you to go.
I don't have much to say.

673
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:12,905
It's time for you to go.
I don't have much to say.

674
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,949
I think Kelly's reaction said
it all.

675
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,701
You guys can head back to camp.
We'll see you tomorrow.

676
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,678
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

677
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,806
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i> Tom's body starts

678
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,642
to rebel.
>> Oh, my golly, gee.

679
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,186
>> Tom's got a third eye.
>> PROBST: Brandon's in the

680
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,813
doghouse.
>> I was set up, but by somebody

681
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,649
I thought was my friend.
>> PROBST: And Lex's loyalty is

682
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:52,820
questioned.
>> And Lex is beginning to give

683
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,030
us the shake, you know.
>> Last night we had to do

684
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,032
something to save our ass.
I acted and I'm regretting it

685
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:05,624
now.
>> I love you, Mom and Dad.

686
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,003
I can't help but be myself,
and I've never been too good at

687
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,630
sticking to one clique.
I always kind of float around.

688
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,674
It was hard for me not to have
friends in different places,

689
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,135
and that kind of screwed me,
but hey, I made it past the hard

690
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,345
part with the boulders and
whatnot, and for a skinny girl,

691
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,972
that's kind of, you know, it's a
big deal.

692
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,266
I had a lot of fun.
