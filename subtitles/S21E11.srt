1
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:18,180
This season's castaways have endured 27
days on the rugged shores of Nicaragua.

2
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:22,884
They have battled exhaustion,
starvation, and each other.

3
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:26,688
I'll push you so hard that
damn leg will fly off.

4
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:30,258
In their fight to become
the sole survivor.

5
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:34,162
If you are 40 and older,
you're over here.

6
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:36,364
30 and younger, you're over here.

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,301
For the first time in "survivor"

8
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:42,370
history, tribes were
divided strictly by age.

9
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,271
The young guns.

10
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:44,639
I'm young at heart!

11
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:50,712
Pitting young against old in an
epic struggle for dominance.

12
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:55,684
On the la flor twrieb players
weren't afraid to use their

13
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:56,818
youth to their advantage.

14
00:00:56,853 --> 00:01:02,190
I have always used flirting and
I will use that if I have to.

15
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,025
I trust our five and that is it.

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,660
Drawing clear lines within the tribe.

17
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:08,630
The older tribe had wisdom and
experience but not even the

18
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:13,401
presence of super bowl winning coach
jimmie Johnson... team huddle.

19
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:16,037
...Could keep some of the tribe
from going over the edge.

20
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,706
She stole my shoes.

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,440
She stole them.

22
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:19,908
It's a good thing you're not a guy.

23
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:23,044
It's enjoyable just to watch a
little bit of tension in this tribe.

24
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,247
Marty finally took control at espada.

25
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:26,748
Do not mess around with me.

26
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:30,152
I mean, I'm playing
this game for real.

27
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:33,622
But they could only watch
as young tribe won early

28
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:38,593
and often, slashing the older
tribe's numbers and putting them

29
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:42,664
in serious jeopardy, having only
been to tribal council once, the

30
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:45,333
younger tribe seemed invincible.

31
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:46,601
Drop your buffs.

32
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:51,006
But a surprise switch changed
the game dramatically.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,410
At the new espada, older members
holly and Dan joined forces with

34
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:59,681
their new tribemates to
vote out two of their own.

35
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:06,288
Brenda and sash reined over the
new la flor, leaving the espada

36
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:09,925
puppet master Marty stripped
of his power and his idol.

37
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,061
Going into the merge, the
younger members had the numbers

38
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:15,830
and Brenda and sash
still called the shots.

39
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:19,201
Marty, is not running the camp.

40
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:20,535
Sash and I are running the camp.

41
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,403
100%.

42
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:25,640
But as new alliances formed,
serious cracks begin to

43
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:32,948
show in the old la flor core alliance.

44
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:38,053
20 castaways set out
on this epic journey.

45
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,888
Only nine remain.

46
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:44,459
Tonight, in a special episode
of "survivor," we take a deeper

47
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:49,931
look at how the final nine have survived
27 days of grueling competition.

48
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:55,303
New scenes reveal the conflicts,
strategies, and power plays that

49
00:02:55,338 --> 00:03:01,643
have brought these nine within days
of becoming the sole survivor.

50
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,530
The older espada tribe
arrived at camp on kay one.

51
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:20,832
We did it, guys.

52
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:21,800
How are you?

53
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,003
Ready to put their wisdom
and experience to work.

54
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:28,440
I'll be interested to see how
our older people hold up.

55
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,209
We're the underdog, the older
folks, but I hope we come

56
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:34,879
together enough to where
we can surprise people.

57
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,748
Shelter is the most
important thing right now.

58
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,283
Marty's right, shelter first.

59
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:43,388
We need to figure out where
we're going to do it, though.

60
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:44,622
There's low tide right now.

61
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,893
You tonight want to be too close
to the water see, I think...

62
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:54,199
As soon as we hit the beach,
everybody startsiacking, yelling.

63
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,133
Everybody is excited.

64
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,469
We had all chiefs and no Indians.

65
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,637
Can I say one thing?

66
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,674
There are some palm fronds.

67
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:07,812
I think we collectively agreed... there's
a lot of testosterone over there.

68
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,615
Tyrone wants to go in control.

69
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:13,151
If the shelter is here...
Jimmie Johnson is used to

70
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:14,519
being in a control situation.

71
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:18,389
If somebody wants to try and see what
it's like to split a bamboo in half...

72
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,260
Marty looks like he wants to be a
little bit of a leader, t too.

73
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:26,164
So let them lead, you know, but give me
a couple of good ideas once in a while.

74
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,800
We need to figure out about how
high we're going to have it.

75
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,771
The power struggle has began, man.

76
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,439
The game is on.

77
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:39,444
People want to act like they know
what they're doing, build a shelter.

78
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:42,580
Joe pesci over there I think knows
a little bit about construction.

79
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,682
Who the hell ever built
a shelter before.

80
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,951
I was born and raised
in Brooklyn, New York.

81
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,120
They think I haven't built a shelter?

82
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,022
We can't just sleep on that.

83
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,857
Five hours of daylight left.

84
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:53,224
Okay.

85
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,527
I'm all for... Watch it!

86
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:55,894
Watch it.

87
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,961
I don't see progress.

88
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,331
But I do hear conversation.

89
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,400
And it's a bit entertaining.

90
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:05,069
We may end up keeping this roof.

91
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,472
Jimmy t.
'S style is, "look at me!

92
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:08,907
I crave attention."

93
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:09,307
Listen.

94
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,609
I don't feed into that.

95
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,212
Because it's just like a crying child.

96
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:17,248
Necessary their diaper needs to
be changed, if you don't respond

97
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,650
to that nonsense, they'll stop.

98
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:21,219
I feel like I'm being
ignored by you guys.

99
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,988
We can walk while we talk.

100
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:29,561
Each guy grab each a pole and we put it
up here and we've got our structure.

101
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:36,901
I heard some rah-rah going
on, a couple of profanities.

102
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,369
The girls are doing great.

103
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,606
We're weaving palm frondz.

104
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,711
The boys have built and unbuilt the
shelter our or five times already.

105
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:48,713
I think it's going to
be a long night for us.

106
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,815
All right, that was good.

107
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,584
Are we done?

108
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,218
Time to go home?

109
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:06,231
Things were much more relaxed
at the young la flor tribe?

110
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,832
Time to swim?

111
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,534
Where fun was priority number one.

112
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,970
Ready, one, two, three.

113
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:12,170
Okay.

114
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:16,174
So it was like, hi, my name is Brenda.

115
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,009
I'm getting to my underwear now.

116
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:21,713
As the younger tribe we have a huge
advantage because we have so much energy.

117
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,780
All of us are fit.

118
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,517
And we're all so happy to be here.

119
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,386
Underwear!

120
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:28,653
Whooo!

121
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:29,520
Those are cute!

122
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,958
I think the biggest advantage
is we're getting along so well.

123
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,326
We're in Nicaragua.

124
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,729
I am really happy that I'm
on the younger tribe.

125
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:40,398
We're not really set in our ways.

126
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:43,835
Like older people, they're kind of like...
They're already set in their ways.

127
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,571
They think they know everything
and it's going to be a lot

128
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,873
harder for them to bond and click.

129
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,276
The la flor tribe just
wants to be in the water.

130
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,077
I'm with a bunch of idiots.

131
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:57,715
I wish that I had been on the other
tribe because they're a lot smatter.

132
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,751
I believe they had a shelter.

133
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:01,920
I believe they had a door.

134
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,123
Probably a few windows and
basement and attic because I

135
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:09,427
know those women were sitting up
there weaving, weaving, we'ving.

136
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:10,328
I know it.

137
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,462
They do have wisdom.

138
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,298
I'm with young idiots.

139
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,766
It's ridiculous.

140
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,568
It's ridiculous.

141
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,438
Hey, do you need another vi vine?

142
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:22,373
Maybe eventually.

143
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:29,080
By nightfall at espada, the tribe had
built some camaraderie, along with some

144
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:29,781
should the.

145
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:33,851
I'll put my hand through the top and
you hit the target other all right.

146
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,787
Throw one up here.

147
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:36,788
Hold on, hold on.

148
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:37,655
Thank you, doctor.

149
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,092
I got a little upset
with some guys earlier.

150
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,260
There's a bunch right here.

151
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,697
Maybe they weren't eloquent
in the way they spoke to me.

152
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,197
But guess what?

153
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:48,333
I like the way guys are
starting to step up.

154
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,369
I think we're starting
to unite as a team.

155
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:51,936
I think that's important.

156
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,172
It can't get any better than this.

157
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,708
One, two, three espada!

158
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,510
I'm about ready to turn in.

159
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,011
Good night!

160
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:03,548
The game plan is to try
to get some sleep.

161
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:06,184
We od our asses off tonight.

162
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,385
Everybody worked hard today.

163
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:08,686
You all right?

164
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,120
Yeah.

165
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:12,991
We have a ramshackle shelter
there but at least it's

166
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,694
something we can all huddle
under and try to get a few

167
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,364
hours' rest and make this place
a lot more livable tomorrow.

168
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,532
What a day today was, seriously.

169
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,700
So far, so good, man.

170
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,237
, you know, you just gotta be careful.

171
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,606
This game changes all tomb.

172
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,241
It's never what you
think it's going to be.

173
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:34,545
Oh!

174
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,783
So I get to spoon with Danny tonight?

175
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,685
That sounds so wrong.

176
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,022
Stew time.

177
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:48,826
Fabio needs a bubble wrapped
all around his body.

178
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,197
By day four at espada, clear roles
were established among the tribe.

179
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:16,034
While we've got everybody here maybe
we should have a conversation.

180
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:19,104
With jimmie Johnson emerging
as the group's natural leader.

181
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,975
First of all, sleeping arrangements,
we've got to readjust.

182
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:25,844
Jimmy, he didn't even
have a spot last night.

183
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,212
We have to come up with a plan.

184
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:29,414
We have to have a plan of rotation.

185
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,250
Tonight I'll sleep on that backside.

186
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,719
So I get to spoon with Danny tonight?

187
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:39,324
Oh, no you spoon... I spooned
with Tyrone last night.

188
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,160
You've spooned with about everybody.

189
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:42,261
That sounds so wrong.

190
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:46,365
But you are my best
spoon, I promise you.

191
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,638
I don't know about you, but I
needed a cigarette when I woke up.

192
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:59,044
No wonder I was up all night.

193
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:05,484
At la flor, fabio came in with a very
different strategy... avoid leadership at

194
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:06,385
all costs.

195
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,253
I came out here with a game plan.

196
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:12,157
I feel like I'm going to be able
to kind of stay under the radar

197
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,326
and slither through things.

198
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,364
I'm just trying to stay cool, stay
confident, but not be stupid.

199
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,432
Did you rub your eye?

200
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,935
Yeah.

201
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,837
Really?

202
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,872
Yeah.

203
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:31,343
I went and picked hot chili
pepper because our breath was

204
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:34,580
disgusting this morning, and we
needed something to get rid of it.

205
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:37,214
Lean your head back.

206
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,160
Oh, my God.

207
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:49,995
It hurts to open it so bad.

208
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,864
Fabio is hilarious.

209
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:54,433
He always gets himself
in a sticky situation.

210
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,134
He always gets himself hurt somehow.

211
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:58,904
I touched the seeds and everything.

212
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:00,138
Will this go away or what?

213
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:05,410
I think fabio needs a bubble
wrapped all around his body

214
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:09,514
because no matter what he does to
himself, he's going to get an owe.

215
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:10,015
He's stupid.

216
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:10,682
He's an idiot.

217
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:14,086
I have to wash my hands
before I touch anything else.

218
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:27,866
Imagine going to the bathroom
touching the chili and this...

219
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:33,538
I don't know if I'm accident prone.

220
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:36,008
I mean, things happen out here, yeah.

221
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:42,614
The yellow are really
hard to pull off.

222
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:48,253
Can we even eat these?

223
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:50,689
Careful, there's a
beehive up there, too.

224
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,457
There's a beehive up here?

225
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,492
Do you see it?

226
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:02,100
There were all the ants inside of it.

227
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:04,002
Maybe that's called
accident prone, whatever.

228
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:09,608
Hey, guys.

229
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:13,312
Ow!

230
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:13,946
Thorns, man.

231
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,049
I don't think people are really
going to see me as I threat.

232
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,019
They're going to be, well, he's
young, he's goofy, and we're not

233
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:23,622
too worried about him.

234
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:23,822
Whoa!

235
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:25,257
Stew time.

236
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,224
Ow.

237
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:28,226
Yeah, baby.

238
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,696
Doesn't that... doesn't
that happen to everybody?

239
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:40,505
I mean... not just me, I don't think.

240
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:53,852
By day nine hunger and
fatigue were already taking

241
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:59,391
a toll and paranoia set in in espada.

242
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,959
Has anybody made an alliance with you?

243
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:01,326
No.

244
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,327
Okay, listen.

245
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:05,831
There's something that's going to
happen tomorrow at the challenge.

246
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:06,732
That's my guess, okay.

247
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:09,701
I think what's going to happen
is a lot of the city kids, okay,

248
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:13,905
are going to merge over to this
tribe, or they're going to put

249
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,878
us with the city kids and the country
kids are going to come over here.

250
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:22,381
That's why nobody is making alliances.

251
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,850
Something is going to happen
tomorrow at the challenge.

252
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:29,187
Holly I think is a very nice person,
but she's... she's off the deep end.

253
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:31,757
When you hear her talk, you
can hear the nervousness.

254
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,526
You can see the tension in her eyes.

255
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,628
She feels the same stress they feel.

256
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:39,564
She needs to do well in this
game and she's not, and now he's

257
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,466
hitting the panic buttons.

258
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:46,038
I'm worried that you're over-thinking it
and just... right now you still seem a

259
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,372
little edgy.

260
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:49,474
No, that's because how I am.

261
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:50,375
I think about things.

262
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,446
But it's going to...
it's eating at you.

263
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,518
The strategy part, I am not going to lie,
I struggle with the strategy part.

264
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:00,519
What's her name?

265
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:01,319
Oh, God.

266
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,221
I'm terrible at names.

267
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:08,226
And that's one thing I didn't think I
would struggle with coming into the game.

268
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:12,164
I thought I maybe over-analyzed
it even before I started but

269
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:14,166
hopefully it won't get me at the end.

270
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,135
So don't worry... I appreciate you
coming and sharing it with me.

271
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,537
It sounds like it's a possibility.

272
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,906
I think it's a very...
pretty strong possibility.

273
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,710
Okay.

274
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,856
Things weren't much better
at la flor, where severe

275
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,692
weather conditions tested the
resolve of the entire tribe.

276
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:46,398
I hope this rain stops, man.

277
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:52,471
It sucks so bad, man.

278
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:54,306
I'm just so frustrated.

279
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,009
It's the rain and just
being, like, wet and cold.

280
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,011
I haven't really been, like, warm.

281
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:02,781
Like every night has been freezing.

282
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:05,951
Everyone else is putting up with it.

283
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:09,988
I don't understand where
why it's so hard for me.

284
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:12,858
If I want to go home, if I just
want it to be over, they're

285
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:26,805
going to think... they're just going
to think I'm, like, super awakweak.

286
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,073
It's killing me out here.

287
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:28,673
I want to quit.

288
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,476
If you can go through this,
you can go through anything.

289
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,378
This rain is hideous.

290
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,548
It can break you down and it
reveals your true character.

291
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,350
Just like a game, it's 10%

292
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:41,253
physical and 90% mental.

293
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:46,558
So if I have to be that girl's rock to
keep her protected then I'll do that.

294
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,393
Purpleicle Sean important
number for our alliance.

295
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:52,427
And we're going to carry
her as far as we can.

296
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,219
Wow.

297
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:14,631
The river' river's into the oce.

298
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:18,067
We had quite the rainstorm but
we're in the middle of the

299
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,536
rainfoster, so what did you expect?

300
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,236
Look at this.

301
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,573
This is all about the
crack right here.

302
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,174
Watch this.

303
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,975
Watch this piece.

304
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,444
Oh, my God.

305
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:29,312
We better step back here.

306
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:33,616
I feel like this is, like,
some kind of 2012 movie.

307
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:37,987
Kelly purple is a huge waste of space.

308
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:43,193
She bitches and moans about
anything and everything.

309
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:44,661
That's sad to me.

310
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:46,996
She's definitely involved
with Brenda's alliance and I

311
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:54,270
think it's time for her to go home.

312
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:02,779
At espada, jimmie Johnson became the
first casualty of the leadership battle.

313
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,947
Jimmy, the tribe has spoken.

314
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,318
But the war was far from over.

315
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,928
With jimmie Johnson gone, the
remaining men at espada angled

316
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:21,364
to fill the leadership vacuum.

317
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:23,533
Actually, we're doing pretty good.

318
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,367
It's a good fire.

319
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:27,070
I've had a plan since I arrived
and started playing this game

320
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:28,972
and my game has finally arrived.

321
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,008
As much as you can ever say
anything in this game, and you

322
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:35,245
can't ever be overly cocky,
but I'm in control finally.

323
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,413
I'm in control of this tribe.

324
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:41,551
Haerg man, we should move this
fire a little further away.

325
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:44,521
These flames, all we need is the
wind and can will catch the wood

326
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:48,324
pile and then it will catch on to the
shelter and then we've got problems.

327
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,559
It's not catching.

328
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:49,959
Huh?

329
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:51,227
It's definitely not catching.

330
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:51,828
You know what?

331
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,964
I'm going to slide this over man.

332
00:17:54,999 --> 00:18:00,436
It won't hurt to slide it over.

333
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:03,306
I'm not trying to impede on
your situation but I'm just

334
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,275
telling you from
experience I've seen it.

335
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,911
That's kind of what I do for a living?

336
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:08,378
You hear me?

337
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:11,381
Yeah, he's a fireman, I get it.

338
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:14,183
But he felt we were in a danger
zone and too much of the wood I

339
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,053
had nearby was going to catch
fire and blah, blah, blah.

340
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:18,454
And like, come on, man.

341
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,223
I know what the guy is all about.

342
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:22,425
He likes to hear himself speaks.

343
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:26,396
He needs to feel that people are
listening to him as he asserts himself.

344
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:32,101
If this lights up and then the whole
shelter... do whatever you want with the

345
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:32,602
fire.

346
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:32,769
You.

347
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:35,939
You can be mad if you want but
I'm going to push the fire

348
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:39,175
away because I'm not sleeping in the
rain any more than I already have.

349
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:42,478
I think Marty is not used
to taking a back seat.

350
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:48,484
I think his little... whatever...
his eago or pride got in the way.

351
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,955
He threw a little hissey fit and
stormed off like a little girl.

352
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:54,157
When I was talking about the
fire and I said we probably need

353
00:18:54,191 --> 00:18:59,228
to move it over and you said,
"don't the thing all up."

354
00:18:59,263 --> 00:18:59,963
I'm just saying.

355
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:02,999
When you pulled the whole
fire I've been carefully

356
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,368
constructing and everything
else you have to give some

357
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:07,470
consideration into the time
and effort I put into it.

358
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,105
I'm giving you all that.

359
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:12,108
But I'm just telling you,
there's a way to talk to me.

360
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:16,346
I talk with you with with respect
and I felt like you were

361
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,817
disrespectful to me and if you
are disrespectful to me again

362
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,352
it's going to get ugly.

363
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:28,458
Now you're throwing a real heavy
disrespectful to when all I said was, "don't

364
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:30,093
with my whole fire."

365
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:34,397
Come on, man, don't you
think that's exaggerating.

366
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:39,369
And now you said, "Marty, don't you
ever be disrespectful to me again."

367
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:40,536
And I don't know what.

368
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:42,438
Some kind of threat or something.

369
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,806
I don't respond well to that.

370
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,576
Hey, man, don't push me that way.

371
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,847
I'm not going to tolerate being
pushed that way, either.

372
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,015
Don't tell me I'm wrong.

373
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:52,982
Don't threaten me.

374
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:54,917
Now you've stepped too far.

375
00:19:54,952 --> 00:19:55,585
We've moved on.

376
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,353
Like men, I thought we had moved on.

377
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:59,022
Whatever you want to do, but
we're playing the game.

378
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:02,191
I came to you right now, and I
knew it wasn't going to be an

379
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:03,426
easy conversation for you or me.

380
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,695
When you threaten somebody,
it usually isn't.

381
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:08,064
No, if I was threatening
you would know it.

382
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:09,298
Trust me, game or no game.

383
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,870
I would just love to be able to throw
down tonight and say, "dude, here it is.

384
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:14,971
Wake up, dude.

385
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,706
Wake up and smell the roses."

386
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,375
Guess who's going to be
the number one target?

387
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,982
Jane, I don't know where
her loyalties will lie.

388
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,352
Beg, borrow, steal,
whatever I've got to do.

389
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,254
I'm going to try to win
a million dollars.

390
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:32,422
Do you know where Jane is?

391
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:34,290
I want to work with you
till the end game.

392
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:34,657
Yup.

393
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,626
I do kind of believe sash right now.

394
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,396
He would be one of the easiest to beat
at the end for a million dollars.

395
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:41,997
0t

396
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:08,796
after a surprise tribe switch on day 12,
former espada members were suddenly

397
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,967
outnumbered at the new la flor and had
to scramble to prove their worth.

398
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,135
Where are you two from?

399
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:14,869
Miami.

400
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:15,469
Oh, okay.

401
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:17,405
St. Louis.

402
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:21,108
My position when I was on
espada was totally solid.

403
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:25,413
Now coming here, there's five of
them, three of the older tribe.

404
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:26,547
My position is not so good.

405
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:29,684
I had fire within 20 minutes of camp.

406
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:30,451
Wow.

407
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:33,888
I like you.

408
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:34,555
You fish, right?

409
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,423
I fish.

410
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:37,792
Jane, I don't know where
her loyalties will lie.

411
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:40,194
I think she may be bonding with them.

412
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:42,129
She's the most skilled
person out here.

413
00:21:42,164 --> 00:21:44,365
I call her "survivor MacGyver."

414
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:45,366
She can do anything.

415
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,836
He gets fish, she gets crark
she has boundless energy.

416
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,306
And it's hard to argue against a
full belly so I'm very worried

417
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:55,977
that Jane's ability to bring in
food for the camp is going to be

418
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:59,046
what sends Marty and I home.

419
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:01,749
One of my strategies right
there is I'm just trying to be

420
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:04,185
the provider out here.

421
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:07,388
Trying to come in this game
as fully prepared as I can.

422
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:12,493
I mean, I started kind of like
restricting my food a couple of

423
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:16,397
months ago, just in case I got
on the show so that I wouldn't

424
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:19,033
feel all the hunger pains.

425
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,836
Not only that, I bought me a
sauna, and I started sitting in

426
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,406
it up to 170 crazy so the
heat doesn't bother me.

427
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,245
I think that paid off.

428
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,279
Hopefully, fingers crossed,
I'll get fish today.

429
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:50,264
It worked!

430
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:51,898
Whooo!

431
00:22:57,305 --> 00:22:58,439
I'm starving.

432
00:22:58,473 --> 00:23:00,307
I want me a fish.

433
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:03,144
I'm gonna eat this one I just caught.

434
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:09,483
Every now and then, the
provider needs a meal.

435
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:13,521
Well, just too late in the day,
not enough heat in the sun.

436
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:18,192
I'm going to go get me a stick
out of the fire and see if I can

437
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,826
sneak it down here.

438
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:53,060
I was just trying to divert
attention away from the campfire

439
00:23:53,095 --> 00:24:01,736
so it won't look suspicious because
I really want to steal fire embers.

440
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,805
Y'all want to go help
wash all those crabs?

441
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,173
Yeah, I can do that.

442
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:09,477
Somebody ought to go help her.

443
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:15,716
She's losing thim.

444
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:17,585
Some of them jumped out.

445
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:18,586
Oh, they did.

446
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:24,558
Run help her.

447
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:28,095
Everybody upons me knows that
I'm a very honest person.

448
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,866
How I play this game has nothing
at all to do with my real life.

449
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,734
I'm out to win a million dollars.

450
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:38,272
Beg, bor oh, steal, whatever I
gotta do, I'm gonna try and win

451
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:42,309
a million dollars.

452
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:45,446
Do you know where Jane is?

453
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:48,716
Oh, this is going to be so good.

454
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,684
I got me a meal.

455
00:24:50,719 --> 00:25:00,661
And it's in my stomach, not theirs.

456
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:17,818
On the new espada tribe, the addition
of four young members forced the older

457
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:20,854
tribemates to rethink
their strategies.

458
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:24,591
Who's here from our old
team, our old tribe?

459
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:28,662
Me, you, Tyrone, and who else?

460
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:29,163
Yve.

461
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:30,831
I don't see anybody beating us.

462
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,299
I don't, either.

463
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,434
You picked the cream of the crop.

464
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:35,102
Thanks, Dan.

465
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,470
It's true.

466
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,405
Brand new game, brand new people.

467
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:42,809
As far as strategy, I'm probably...
I'm probably super vulnerable here.

468
00:25:42,844 --> 00:25:46,914
I mean, I'm the oldest guy by far.

469
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:49,983
Whenever I get in front of the
mirror next time I'll be pulling

470
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:52,519
hair out of my ears and
shaving my beard off.

471
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:55,622
I think I'm going to let
it go salt and pepper now.

472
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:57,191
As long as it's not all salt.

473
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,559
It's pretty long.

474
00:25:58,593 --> 00:26:00,627
Yeah, look at his roots.

475
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:01,628
Let's see your hair.

476
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:04,331
It looks like a wig.

477
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:05,232
It does

478
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:11,405
oh, my God, Dan!

479
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,140
Oh, no way!

480
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:14,007
Leave it.

481
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,876
I have a major strategy now.

482
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,878
I'm trying to make new friends, yeah.

483
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:22,182
I'm trying to get in with them
and, you know, I'm trying... I'm

484
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:23,317
trying to get into the crowd.

485
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:24,685
I'm a competitive guy.

486
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:26,153
I don't want to lose it.

487
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:27,421
The kids like me, you know.

488
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:31,425
But who knows, I could
be screwed tonight.

489
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,160
They may be playing a game
with me and I'm gone.

490
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,762
Show up at the challenge
like that tomorrow.

491
00:26:35,797 --> 00:26:35,963
Yeah!

492
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:36,396
Just do it.

493
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:37,898
It will be so intimidating.

494
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:41,301
Dan is hilarious, and
he's totally valuable.

495
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:44,071
He's valuable because he's week.

496
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:47,574
His position is the number because
& that's why we need him.

497
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:52,212
He knows that he's weakand he's
happy that we keep him around so

498
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:53,080
he'll be loyal to us.

499
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,414
There you go.

500
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:57,049
That's amazing.

501
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:12,799
We day 16 at the new la
flor, mart I's grip on the

502
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:18,272
game and his idol were awakened,
while save began a power move to

503
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:20,507
become the game's new puppet master.

504
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:23,377
I was just curious to have
you walk me through what the

505
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,445
thinking was so I can understand
what the thinking was.

506
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,485
There's no doubt that you having the idol
makes, you know, some people nervous.

507
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,289
It's absolutely ridiculous for
me to do any kind of move or

508
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:40,060
try to leverage that idol pre-merge.

509
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:42,529
At this point in time I'm
not controlling the game.

510
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:45,132
I'm no longer in the driver's seat.

511
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,901
So I'm along for the expried that's
the best that I can do right now.

512
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:51,905
I think with everyone here on
la flor, I think you may be one

513
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:59,179
of the only people that may have a
50-50 shot of winning at the end.

514
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:02,416
I'm telling you this to try to
tell you what my thoughts are.

515
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,217
I'm not just thinking merge.

516
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:05,719
I'm thinking also... clearly.

517
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:06,353
Long term.

518
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:08,288
Sash is a pretty smart player.

519
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:11,591
And when he laid out his plans
for me, I was, you know, further

520
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:13,694
impressed with the way he's
thinking about this game.

521
00:28:13,728 --> 00:28:18,398
But you caint be cocky or
over-confident in this game but

522
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:19,766
I do believe sash right now.

523
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,302
I want to work with
you to the end game.

524
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:23,170
Yeah.

525
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:24,171
I'm all for it, man.

526
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:29,876
There is a little bit of truth to what I
said to Marty about going to the end.

527
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:34,247
I think of everyone at la flor
right now, he'd be one of the

528
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:36,850
easiest to beat at the end
for a million dollars.

529
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:41,321
If we have each other's backs,
why not go to the end?

530
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:43,390
I've been making end
agreements with everyone.

531
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:47,094
I think it would be great if we
watched out for each other's back.

532
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:48,895
I would think we're top four.

533
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:53,934
I would love to get all
the way to end with you.

534
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:59,473
I want to make a safe pact with
every single member of la flor

535
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:02,275
to guarantee me a final
spot at the end.

536
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,713
I see us moving, you and I
personally, moving much further

537
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:09,449
along in the game together.

538
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:11,184
Love to do it, man.

539
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:14,488
Saying that you want someone
to be next to you at final

540
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:19,025
tribal council and promising
it are two different things.

541
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,196
Come final tribal council, they'll
number for a rude awakening.

542
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:25,899
I think we could really
dominate this game.

543
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,369
I think so, too, man.

544
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:37,110
Whoever did it, something
should happen to them.

545
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:40,213
To them or their family.

546
00:29:40,248 --> 00:29:43,984
Chase and Jane, they're tight
but I don't think he's smart

547
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:45,552
enough or bold enough to make a move.

548
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:51,483
I just hope Brenda ain't
playing y'all for a fool.

549
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:13,752
On day 19, la flor moved over to the
espada camp and the two tribes became one.

550
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:15,887
Libertad.

551
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:20,091
Oh, my God!

552
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:22,294
Chocolate chip cookies!

553
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:23,028
Rum!

554
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:23,628
No.

555
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:24,529
Yeah!

556
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:29,301
But the celebration didn't last long.

557
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:33,939
Old alliances were immediately
tested and new pains were formed

558
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:39,844
when naonka committed the
ultimate crime... stealing food.

559
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,647
I saw her put the flour in the bag.

560
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:44,816
And I couldn't understand why.

561
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:51,089
I should have confronted her
right away and I didn't.

562
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:53,723
They're so stupid.

563
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,468
Hey, where's the flour?

564
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:06,538
Naonka, did you put the flour back
in the chest after you used...

565
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:08,807
everybody saw me put it in there.

566
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:12,344
You didn't see me then you didn't
see me but I put it in there.

567
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:16,548
That doesn't just get swept
away by the tide, you guys.

568
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:19,351
No, I think it's pretty
obvious somebody stole it.

569
00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:21,620
Whoever did it, something
should happen to them.

570
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:23,088
To them or their family.

571
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:23,722
They should go home.

572
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,589
This is how I feel.

573
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:25,323
Yeah.

574
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:26,424
Stealing food.

575
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:29,628
When you have a guilty conscience,
you have to say something.

576
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:31,563
You can't live with it.

577
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:35,166
So she came to me and she
didn't know what she should do.

578
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:36,868
Are you going to go
back and say something?

579
00:31:36,902 --> 00:31:39,037
No, what am I going to say?

580
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,639
I just don't want you to.

581
00:31:40,673 --> 00:31:42,807
So how are you going to get
out of this situation?

582
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:46,811
I'm going it it it it to put it out
there and not say anything else.

583
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:49,781
You're going to put it in
a pile and not saying.

584
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:51,416
Nay, as a mom, okay?

585
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:51,883
Yeah.

586
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:54,653
The only thing I can tell you
is when you do something wrong,

587
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:57,055
it's better to confess
and say you're sorry.

588
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:02,594
You're going to get
way farther in life.

589
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:05,563
So that's the only
advice I can give you.

590
00:32:05,598 --> 00:32:05,964
Okay?

591
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:06,498
Okay.

592
00:32:06,532 --> 00:32:08,633
I don't know, something about holly.

593
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:11,703
She kind of remind me of
my mom, and I respect her.

594
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:15,006
It helps me out a lot, and I
would like to have holly here

595
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:21,312
for as long as we could have her here,
until she's not valuable anymore.

596
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:22,280
Why did you tell me?

597
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:26,017
Because I love you.

598
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:28,286
That's why.

599
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,792
And it took a lot more fee to
say that because I'm ed up.

600
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,694
That's okay.

601
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:39,164
I really up.

602
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:41,566
I feel really bad.

603
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,469
Go put it back.

604
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:44,803
Thank you.

605
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,871
It's okay.

606
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:48,907
We all make mistakes.

607
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:52,844
My mothering instincts are
definitely kicking in with these

608
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:57,882
kids, and it kind of helps
because she look as at me as a

609
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,617
mom figure so I definitely
have her on my side.

610
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:00,885
I'll start it off.

611
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,423
Earlier this morning, after we
made the tortillas, I did put

612
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,291
everything back in there.

613
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:07,525
I did grap the flour.

614
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,161
And my purpose for grabbing the
flour was to measure it out to

615
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:14,065
put half and half because we were
using a whole lot of food, okay?

616
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:18,269
Don't think it's strange to
see a young woman go nuto.

617
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:21,439
If it happens to a
woman, you expect it.

618
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:22,874
It's that Brooklyn attitude.

619
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:25,777
If one of the guys had done that
I would have told him to get the

620
00:33:25,811 --> 00:33:27,412
out of here and don't come bab.

621
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:28,880
That's for sure.

622
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:35,220
Let's go get it and bring it here.

623
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:36,554
You know it was here.

624
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:37,355
You don't remember?

625
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:40,625
You don't... well, I just
said I don't remember.

626
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:41,593
How do you not remember?

627
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:47,632
I just need a moment so I
can, just, like, look.

628
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,934
Naonka obviously wasn't thinking
straight, you know, and

629
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:51,469
for her to do something like this.

630
00:33:51,504 --> 00:33:53,538
I just hope she goes home soon.

631
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:55,607
And that would be fine.

632
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:58,143
It's so immature.

633
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:01,279
I am so pissed off at naonka.

634
00:34:01,313 --> 00:34:04,749
She is way too emotional to
have as a core alliance.

635
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:09,654
It really made me question her
intelligence and really where

636
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:11,489
her focus is on the game.

637
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:14,492
She might not be the best
person to go to the end with.

638
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:17,028
Where's the flour?

639
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:19,731
Is it at a tree.

640
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:22,500
There's a tree over here and
there's an arrow going to it and

641
00:34:22,535 --> 00:34:23,501
I've been looking for it.

642
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:24,969
You don't remember which tree?

643
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:25,804
No.

644
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,372
There's an arrow on the ground.

645
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:29,040
I made an arrow with sticks.

646
00:34:29,074 --> 00:34:31,743
I feel like we've been over this area.

647
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:34,946
This sucks.

648
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,582
You rail screwed up.

649
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,584
You've just got to trust 100%

650
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:42,220
that our alliance is still strong.

651
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:43,888
I'm not going to blind side you.

652
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:44,989
We still need you.

653
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:45,957
You still need us.

654
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:46,825
Yeah.

655
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,193
So let's go.

656
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:51,629
I was just shocked that naonka
would do something so stupid.

657
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:53,598
Like, you're in a perfect alliance.

658
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:57,001
You've got everything going for
us and you're going to go put a

659
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:59,737
target on your back which
hurts our alliance.

660
00:34:59,772 --> 00:35:01,539
Like, come onaonka.

661
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:02,440
Stop being so stupid.

662
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:03,508
It could be right here.

663
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:07,512
Here it is.

664
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:09,546
Where was it?

665
00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:16,020
It has not been opened
since this morning.

666
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:16,788
We've got it.

667
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:17,856
We found it.

668
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,389
Where was it?

669
00:35:18,424 --> 00:35:18,990
Over there.

670
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:20,925
At that tree.

671
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,927
You really mistaked over
there for right here?

672
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:23,795
Yes, I did.

673
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:26,497
We've got to get her out now.

674
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:33,771
I like her... well, I
don't want to say that.

675
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:46,784
With naonka's flour scandal
behind them, the tribe

676
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:54,492
took time away from the game
to let their hair down.

677
00:35:54,526 --> 00:36:03,134
♪ He's always my very best friend
I'm just standing here ♪

678
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:05,336
Singing a song for me is therapy.

679
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:10,842
I started writing songs about a
month and a half after my dad died.

680
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:14,512
I think that was the first time,
you know, I've shared some of my

681
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:15,980
music with my tribemates.

682
00:36:16,015 --> 00:36:19,684
I'm just trying to be the guy
that everyone likes and try to

683
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:28,259
get along with everyone.
* He was my hero, dad you were,

684
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:29,394
larger than life *

685
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:33,398
Chase's song about his dad
got me super emotional.

686
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:37,101
Singing, music always has all
these emotions, and I thought no

687
00:36:37,136 --> 00:36:41,039
one could see me, but I started
to tear up a bit just thinking

688
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,740
about... just the whole thing.

689
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:48,713
Just so many emotions.

690
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:49,614
That was great.

691
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:53,885
But I just have to remind myself
to stay focused on the game.

692
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:56,421
My life will never be
the same, ever again.

693
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:59,791
Anybody who wants to really play
this game and win this game

694
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:02,126
has to do so without emotions.

695
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:04,262
I need to go to bed.

696
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:05,496
Yeah, me, too.

697
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:06,597
Chase is super emotional.

698
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:08,199
He's not thinking about the game.

699
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:12,403
He's just trying to be nice,
which is great, good for you.

700
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,505
Put that's not going to make you win.

701
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,608
So you go home feeling like a
great guy, but you will go home

702
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:25,416
without a until dollars and someone
else will, which is fine for me.

703
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:35,516
By day 27, power couple sash and Brenda
were in complete control of the tribe.

704
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:38,820
It should really be you
and me running the show.

705
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:42,290
I know you're working your magic,
just like I am, with all

706
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:43,524
the guys and everything else.

707
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,125
Exactly.

708
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,260
So I'm not worried about it.

709
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:51,666
But, you know, not everyone is
as smart as we are, either.

710
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,637
So I know all the guys
like you, you know.

711
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:59,440
Chase is definitely
on the out with them.

712
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,143
They would much rather
have you on our side.

713
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:05,880
I'm on whichever side is
more convenient for us.

714
00:38:05,914 --> 00:38:07,515
For us to get to the end.

715
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:10,818
Brenda and I believe we're the
two smartest people in the game.

716
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:15,823
Both she and I have almost cast a
special spell over pretty much

717
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,759
everyone in the tribe.

718
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:22,497
So Brenda and I have the power
to send whoever we want home.

719
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:25,933
I'm, you know, telling all these
people, "oh, year, final three."

720
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:28,569
But you're really the only one
I care about going to the end

721
00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:31,472
with, and whoever our third
is... doesn't matter.

722
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,674
Is, whoever, so.

723
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,610
But it can't be chase.

724
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:38,212
Brenda and I are in the driver's seat.

725
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:40,948
However, we both understand
that we're probably the biggest

726
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:43,851
threats for the million
dollars at the end.

727
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:47,422
So although we're conspiring
together to make it to the end,

728
00:38:47,456 --> 00:38:49,390
I don't know if we both will.

729
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:53,061
My only concern right
now is chase and Jane.

730
00:38:53,095 --> 00:38:54,529
They're tight.

731
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:58,433
But I don't think he's smart enough for,
like, or bold enough to make a move.

732
00:38:58,467 --> 00:39:03,871
Brenda and sash's arrogance would prove
to be a serious blind spot in their

733
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:07,241
strategy purpose they were about to
discover the limits of their employer.

734
00:39:07,276 --> 00:39:08,109
Hey, Jane.

735
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:10,745
I trust you and I know you trust me.

736
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:13,848
I don't want to sit here and
vote something against you.

737
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:17,652
Right now I'm not sure but voting out
Brenda is the right thing to do.

738
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:21,656
I know brendaments to get me out.

739
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:21,923
I think.

740
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:24,158
We can get her out when we
want is the only thing.

741
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:27,995
Chase and fabio grabbed me, and
they're like, "well, I just

742
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,965
don't think it's a good
idea to vote Brenda out."

743
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,401
And I'm looking at him like sucker!

744
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:35,036
What have they done to you?

745
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,272
You're a hell of a dude, and I'm
telling you, you've got a great

746
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:39,140
brain up there.

747
00:39:39,174 --> 00:39:45,980
I'm trying to make in roads with
fabio to open his eyes up that

748
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:48,349
Brenda is going to
use him like a pawn.

749
00:39:48,383 --> 00:39:50,084
But fabio can't see it.

750
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,256
Chase can't see it because she
has her magic powers over these

751
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,358
young men, and they're falling for it.

752
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:59,594
I don't think that's the
best thing to do, man.

753
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:00,228
I really don't?

754
00:40:00,262 --> 00:40:01,395
What do you think?

755
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,230
Who?

756
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:04,332
Sash.

757
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:06,467
I don't think they're going
to let you go too close.

758
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:07,902
See, I like sash.

759
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,471
I think sash is the biggest
threat around here.

760
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:13,574
Sash don't want to take me
or you to the final three.

761
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:14,709
He doesn't want to do that.

762
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:16,577
Because he knows you or I will win.

763
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:18,679
I would rather her go
sooner than later.

764
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:23,784
Sash and then her and then, you
know, holly and everybody is

765
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:25,887
still around, all the nice people.

766
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:26,954
'Cause we're good.

767
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:28,789
I just don't want to see evil win.

768
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:32,493
I feel good that, you know, we
pulled you... side and talked to you.

769
00:40:32,528 --> 00:40:32,727
Okay.

770
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:34,362
Are you trusting me right now?

771
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:35,596
Yeah, I trust you.

772
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:36,697
I mean, I do.

773
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:41,669
I just hope Brenda ain't
playing y'all for a fool.

774
00:40:41,703 --> 00:40:43,771
I don't want to vote Brenda out.

775
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:45,573
I don't think she's lied to me.

776
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:49,644
And it's... it sucks right notice,
but at some point in the

777
00:40:49,678 --> 00:40:52,213
game, you've got to chop the
neck of the person that you

778
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:56,017
might be closest with, and if
thathat gets me further in the

779
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:57,718
game, I'm going to have to do it.

780
00:40:57,753 --> 00:41:01,689
At tribal council, chase
broke rank from his old

781
00:41:01,723 --> 00:41:04,992
alliance and sided with
his new ally, Jane.

782
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:08,262
The black widow Brenda was
voted out in a landed slide.

783
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:13,234
Brenda, the tribe has spoken.

784
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:15,036
Only nine castaways are left.

785
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,070
Oh, my God!

786
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:18,472
The end is in sight.

787
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:19,974
What!

788
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:22,076
But the closest they get.

789
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,328
Straight out lied to you and me both.

790
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:25,463
He talks too much.

791
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:26,197
He's paranoid.

792
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:27,999
Strategy intensifies.

793
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:30,635
Swear on your mom you
will not backstab me.

794
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:32,236
Conflict escalates.

795
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:35,773
Who will outwit the
cutthroat competition.

796
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:38,009
If we stay a strong four we dominate.

797
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:41,012
Who will out-play in
grueling challenges?

798
00:41:41,046 --> 00:41:42,413
Fabio fighting for the lead.

799
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:44,615
Who the out-last the
extreme conditions?

800
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,983
I made it this far.

801
00:41:46,018 --> 00:41:46,884
I'm proud of myself.

802
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:49,804
Who will become the sole survivor?

803
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:55,476
And then the rest of the
game is smooth sailing.

804
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,516
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

805
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:05,152
Next week on an
all-new "survivor."

806
00:42:05,186 --> 00:42:06,787
As the storms get stronger.

807
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:09,890
It's like class-three rapids.

808
00:42:09,924 --> 00:42:11,492
Naonka gets awaker.

809
00:42:11,526 --> 00:42:15,596
As it rains and pours it
makes me feel like crap.

810
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,900
And purple Kelly finally
has something to say.

811
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:26,373
I don't know how much more
physically I can put up with this.

812
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:36,300
Fish, fish.

813
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:40,737
It's the fish dance.

814
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:41,705
Fish dance.
