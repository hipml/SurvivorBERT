1
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:05,213
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR": 20 AMERICANS TREKKED

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:09,467
INTO THE WILDS OF NICARAGUA, AN
UNTAMED LAND OF ACTIVE VOLCANOS,

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,595
DENSE RAIN FORESTS
AND FIERCE WILDLIFE.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,433
>> EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, THERE'S
MONKEYS HANGING FROM THINGS.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,643
THERE'S DANGEROUS ANIMALS HERE.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,395
IT'S LIKE-- IT'S REAL.

7
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,105
>> Jeff: THEY WERE DIVIDED
INTO TWO TRIBES--

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,606
THE YOUNG VERSUS THE OLD.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,858
>> OH, MAN.

10
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:29,612
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME OF
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE CARRYING ME.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,781
>> Jeff: THE OLDER TRIBE
IMMEDIATELY FELL UNDER THE SWAY

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,284
OF TWO-TIME SUPER BOWL-WINNING
COACH JIMMIE JOHNSON.

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,953
>> AS LONG AS WE'RE PSYCHED UP
FOR IT AND WE KNOW

14
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,581
WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO,
WE'LL KICK THEIR ASS.

15
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,459
>> I JUST GOT A PEP TALK
FROM JIMMIE JOHNSON!

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,961
>> Jeff: ON THE YOUNGER TRIBE,
SHANNON DECIDED

17
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,463
THAT HE WAS THE ALPHA MALE

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,966
AND IMMEDIATELY FORMED A STRONG
MAN ALLIANCE WITH CHASE.

19
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,342
WITHOUT ME OR YOU,
I THINK THEY'RE SCREWED.

20
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,136
BUT CHASE WAS ALSO
DRAWN TO BRENDA.

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,304
>> SHE'S A CUTE GIRL.

22
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,847
I MEAN, YEAH,
I'M ATTRACTED TO HER.

23
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,348
I FOR SOME REASON
REALLY TRUST HER.

24
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,309
>> Jeff: SO HE GOT INTO A SECOND
ALLIANCE WITH HER.

25
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,687
>> CHASE,
HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY.

26
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,813
BUT HE'S CLUELESS.

27
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,273
>> Jeff: MEANWHILE,
ALINA AND KELLY B.

28
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,400
FOUND A CLUE TO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

29
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,694
>> WE KEEP IT BETWEEN US.

30
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,363
>> Jeff: FINDING THE CLUE WAS
A STROKE OF LUCK FOR KELLY B.

31
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:17,327
BECAUSE HER ARTIFICIAL LEG
MADE HER A TARGET.

32
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,871
>> SHE WILL DEFINITELY BEAT UP
WITH SYMPATHY VOTE

33
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,791
SO SHE'S DEFINITELY GOT TO BE
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO GO.

34
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,000
>> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, THE OLDER TRIBE

35
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,336
HELD THE MEDALLION OF POWER
WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM

36
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,338
AN ADVANTAGE IN THE COMPETITION.

37
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,549
IF YOU USE IT, THE MEDALLION
GOES TO THE YOUNGER TRIBE

38
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,510
AND THEY WILL HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY

39
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,344
TO USE IT AT THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

40
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,304
>> WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT.

41
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,514
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING
TO NOT USE IT.

42
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,890
>> DON'T NEED IT.

43
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,517
>> Jeff: UNFORTUNATELY BY NOT
PLAYING THE MEDALLION,

44
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,560
THE OLDER TRIBE
MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

45
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,522
YOUNGER TRIBE WINS IMMUNITY!

46
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,024
BRENDA, WOULD YOU HAVE USED
THAT MEDALLION OF POWER

47
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,484
IN TODAY'S CHALLENGE?

48
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,195
>> DEFINITELY, BECAUSE YOU'RE
HERE TO WIN SO WHY TAKE CHANCES?

49
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,196
>> Jeff: BACK AT CAMP,

50
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,115
JIMMIE JOHNSON DECIDED
WENDY WAS THE WEAK LINK.

51
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,743
>> YOU ASK YOURSELF, DOES THE
TEAM GET STRONGER WITHOUT WENDY?

52
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,703
>> Jeff: JIMMY'S CHOICE
CONCERNED HOLLY

53
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,039
BECAUSE SHE WAS IN AN ALLIANCE
WITH WENDY.

54
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,374
>> FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY CAUGHT
IN A DILEMMA

55
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,211
BECAUSE I SHOOK HER HAND
AND GAVE HER MY WORD.

56
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,047
>> Jeff: BUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
HOLLY TURNED HER BACK

57
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,424
ON HER ALLY AND SIDED
WITH COACH JIMMIE

58
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,386
AND REST OF THE TRIBE
TO VOTE OUT WENDY.

59
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,556
WENDY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

60
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,015
19 ARE LEFT.

61
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,017
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

62
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,362
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND
OF RIGHT NOW ON THE OUTS,

63
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,281
AND I KNOW MY TRIBE SENSES I AM.

64
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:41,536
I JUST FELT BAD ABOUT MAKING THE
ALLIANCE WITH WENDY AND THEN,

65
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,539
OF COURSE, I WENT IN WITH
EVERYBODY ELSE TO VOTE HER OUT.

66
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,083
TONIGHT'S DECISION
WAS FOR MY TEAM.

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,418
>> NO QUESTION.

68
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,044
>> I REALLY LIKED WENDY.

69
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,588
I KNOW IT'S PART
OF THE GAME TO LIE,

70
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,257
AND THAT'S PART OF THE STRATEGY.

71
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,595
SO I THINK MY NEXT STEP NEEDS
TO BE TO RETHINK EVERYTHING.

72
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,055
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW
THESE PEOPLE

73
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,102
THAT I CAN KICK THEIR ASS
ON "SURVIVOR."

74
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,181
>> I DON'T THINK I SLEPT A WINK.

75
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:25,890
>> REALLY.

76
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,935
>> THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK.

77
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,729
>> NO, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET SOME SLEEP.

78
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,648
>> THE PLAN FOR TODAY IS TO GET

79
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,566
TO A BETTER PLACE
WITH REGARDS TO SLEEP.

80
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,819
THE SHELTER'S STILL NOT
TOTALLY THERE.

81
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,861
PEOPLE WERE UP ALL NIGHT.

82
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,321
WE'VE GOT TO GET
THAT DOWN BETTER.

83
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,700
I HAVEN'T SLEPT AT ALL.

84
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,993
>> WE'VE GOT EVERYBODY HERE,

85
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,205
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
A GROUP CONVERSATION.

86
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,084
>> LOOK AT REARRANGING THE
BAMBOO AND LATCHING IT ALL UP.

87
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,669
AND PUTTING THE BEDDING.

88
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,045
>> THE MORNING MEETING WENT
PRETTY GOOD.

89
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,006
IT SEEMS TO BE THIS ROUTINE
WE'VE FALLEN INTO.

90
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,550
EVERYONE SIT DOWN AND DECIDE
WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THE DAY.

91
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,221
COACH GAVE US OUR ASSIGNMENTS
FOR TODAY.

92
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,556
>> YOU'RE GOING TO
HANDLE THE BAMBOO.

93
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,182
>> I'LL HELP ON THE ROOF.

94
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,395
>> JIMMY T. WAS HELPING ME
ON THAT.

95
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,732
>> JANE HAS THIS GOOD IDEA
OF GOING FISHING.

96
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,025
>> TIME OUT, TIME OUT.

97
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,235
>> LET'S STAY ON TRACK.

98
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,070
HEY, JIMMY, WE HEAR YOU.

99
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,530
AND THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

100
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:26,075
THAT'S-- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

101
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,202
SO ON THE ROOF,
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

102
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,579
>> JIMMY'S THE MAN NOW,

103
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,873
AND EVERYBODY IS BUYING IN
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.

104
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:36,294
SO NOW HE'S GOING TO HAVE TD
DOING THIS

105
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,337
AND NOBODY IS SAYING "JIMMY T.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?"

106
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,923
AND IT'S STARTING TO WEAR ON ME.

107
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,593
>> WITH THIS HERE, THE KNOTS ARE
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.

108
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:49,557
>> YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE TRUE.

109
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,059
>> JIMMY J. IS JUMPING IN

110
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,310
AND TRYING TO GIVE DIRECTION TO
THE WHOLE TRIBE

111
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,937
AND I SAID LET'S ROLL WITH THAT.

112
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,314
THAT'S FINE.

113
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,608
FRANKLY, NOW I'M PUTTING
THE PRESSURE ON HIM.

114
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,235
I'M NOT PUTTING MY FACE OUT
THERE ANYMORE.

115
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,111
YOU'RE THE MAN.

116
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,654
I THINK I CAN USE
THAT TO MY ADVANTAGE

117
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,658
IN THE EVENT WE HAVE
TO VOTE SOMEBODY ELSE OFF.

118
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,333
>> I'VE NEVER GONE SO LONG
WITHOUT SHOWERING

119
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,918
OR BRUSHING MY TEETH.

120
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,127
>> I HAVE.

121
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,380
(\LAUGHTER\)

122
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,507
>> SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THIS TRIBE?

123
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,135
>> I'M REALLY HAPPY.

124
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,637
I KNOW ALL THE GUYS
ARE REALLY STRONG.

125
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,931
I KNOW YOU'RE STRONG.

126
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,100
>> WHY EVERYBODY THINK
I'M STRONG?

127
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,684
>> LOOK AT THOSE MUSCLES, GIRL.

128
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,811
>> WHATEVER.

129
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,855
BUT NOBODY HAS, LIKE, NO GUYS
CAME AND TALKED TO ME

130
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,648
OR APPROACHED ME OR NOTHING.

131
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,151
I LIKE SASH A WHOLE LOT.

132
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,946
HE'S DOWN TO EARTH AND HE HAS
THAT MILLION-DOLLAR SMILE.

133
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,157
AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE
A GOOD VIBE, A GOOD CHEMISTRY.

134
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,534
>> I'M HALF BLACK.

135
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,371
MY DAD IS FROM JAMAICA SO I'D
LOVE TO BRING AS MANY MINORITIES

136
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,748
TO THE END AS POSSIBLE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

137
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,166
>> THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD.

138
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,044
I WON'T SHAKE YOUR HAND
BUT I'LL WINK AT YOU.

139
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,505
>> WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, WE
CAN TRY AND BRING IN BRENDA.

140
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,842
I THINK SHE'S THE SMARTEST
PERSON HERE

141
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,677
AND I THINK SHE WOULD BE A GOOD
ASSET, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,472
BEING MINORITIES, WE HAVE A BOND
THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN SHARE.

143
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,559
IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS,
WE COULD DOMINATE THIS GAME.

144
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,520
NOW IT'S JUST UP
TO THE ASIAN SENSATION

145
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,689
IF SHE'S WILLING TO ALIGN WITH
US OR NOT, SO WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.

146
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,817
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TRY
AND, YOU KNOW,

147
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,360
MAKE FRIENDS WITH AS MANY PEOPLE
AS POSSIBLE.

148
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,528
>> EXACTLY.

149
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,321
>> BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALL A NUMBERS GAME.

150
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,198
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT KELLY B.?

151
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,283
>> KELLY B. IS A BIG THREAT

152
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,868
BECAUSE IF SHE CAN MAKE IT
ALL THE WAY TO THE END,

153
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,869
IT'S A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT.

154
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,328
>> RIGHT.

155
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,997
I'VE ALREADY TOLD MYSELF
IF THERE'S A CHALLENGE

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,541
WHERE WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO, LIKE, RACE,

157
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,378
AND THAT LEG FALLS OFF,
SHE'S OUT OF HERE.

158
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,713
FOR REAL.

159
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,174
KELLY B., SHE'S A CHARITY CASE.

160
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,217
SHE HAS THE HEART,
SHE HAS THE MIND,

161
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,886
BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE 100%
OF THE BODY

162
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,929
AND THAT'S GOING TO HURT US.

163
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,612
TODAY, I SAW JILL EATING SNAILS,

164
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,615
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU COULD
EAT THEM OR NOT.

165
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,951
SHE WAS GOING LIKE THIS...

166
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,079
AND ROLLING HER EYES, AND THEN
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

167
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,999
WHEN JILL ACTED THAT WAY, THAT
YOU REALLY COULDN'T EAT THEM.

168
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,417
>> YOU GOTTA TRY THESE.

169
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,585
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I'LL PASS.

170
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,586
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

171
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,754
>> NO.

172
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,381
>> I'LL ADMIT IT,
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

173
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,759
YOU HONESTLY THINK
YOU CAN EAT THESE THINGS?

174
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,552
YOU GUYS ARE STUPID.

175
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,553
>> ARE YOU LOSING IT?

176
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,554
ARE YOU HAVING A MELTDOWN?

177
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,722
>> WHY IS SHE GETTING ALL MAD?

178
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,599
>> I DON'T KNOW.

179
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,769
>> HOLLY IS A VERY NICE PERSON
BUT SHE'S OFF THE DEEP END.

180
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,522
SHE NEEDS TO DO WELL IN THIS
GAME AND SHE'S NOT

181
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,276
AND NOW SHE'S HITTING
THE PANIC BUTTON.

182
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,903
>> THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE SNAILS

183
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,655
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO THINK OF HOLLY.

184
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,075
HER MENTAL STATE IS NOT GOOD,
AND IN "SURVIVOR"

185
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,785
YOU DON'T WANT TO COME ACROSS
AS MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

186
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,247
ALL OF A SUDDEN HOLLY GRABBED
THE POT AND, LIKE,

187
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,082
TOOK OFF, AND SHE DUMPED THEM.

188
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,959
>> WOW.

189
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,960
THROWING AWAY FOOD, THAT'S--

190
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:04,961
>> AND THEY WERE HUGE.

191
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,962
AND THEY WERE GOOD PROTEIN.

192
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,421
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

193
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,422
>> THEY WEREN'T EDIBLE?

194
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,423
>> THEY WERE FINE.

195
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:09,966
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

196
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,593
>> HOLLY SNAPPED AT JILL

197
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,137
AND IT WAS REALLY KIND OF
A BIZARRE TYPE THING.

198
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,139
I'M JUST KEEPING
MY FINGERS CROSSED

199
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,977
THAT SHE CAN TURN IT AROUND
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

200
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,312
>> SHE'S CRAZY AS (
O AUDIO\),
MAN.

201
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,480
>> HUH?

202
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:25,982
>> SHE'S CRAZY AS (
O AUDIO\).

203
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,819
>> I DON'T THINK THEY REALIZED
THAT I WAS WATCHING THEM,

204
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,656
AND DAN, WHO IS MAKING FUN OF
ME, THAT GETS UNDER MY SKIN.

205
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:39,161
SO I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR ME
TO HANDLE THE SITUATION WITH DAN

206
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,957
IS TO TRY TO FIND A WAY
TO RELEASE MY ANGER.

207
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,586
THE NEW YORK CITY BOY, DAN,
HE DOESN'T LIKE SAND ON HIM.

208
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,380
SO LET'S JUST FILL HIS SHOES UP,
AND THEN...

209
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,840
PUT THEM SOMEWHERE.

210
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,510
MAKE SURE THEY'RE TIED.

211
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,220
TAKE THEM UP HERE.

212
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,722
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT BACK
ANYMORE

213
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,017
AND LET THEM RUB THINGS
IN MY FACE.

214
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,727
I'VE BEEN TOO NICE
UP TO THIS POINT.

215
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,855
BUT THE GAME HAS JUST BEGUN.

216
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,570
PAYBACK.

217
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,207
>> MY ALLIGATOR SHOES
ARE MISSING.

218
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,084
>> HAVE YOU LOOKED UNDER?
HAVE YOU LOOKED UNDER?

219
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,880
>> WHO WOULD TAKE THEM OUT OF
MY BAG AND PUT THEM UNDER HERE?

220
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,715
>> ANYONE KNOW--

221
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,843
>> THEY'RE NOT UNDER THERE.

222
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,221
>> SO I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND I LOOKED IN MY BAG,

223
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,557
AND MY ALLIGATOR SHOES
ARE MISSING.

224
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,352
>> NO!

225
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,312
>> THEY WERE IN MY BAG
AND THEY'RE GONE.

226
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,897
>> AND THEY'RE GONE
FROM INSIDE YOUR BAG?

227
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,066
>> WERE THEY EXPENSIVE?

228
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,108
>> $1,600.

229
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,610
>> WHAT? FOR A PAIR OF SHOES?

230
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,778
>> OH, MY GOD.

231
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,614
>> THAT MEANS SOMEBODY HERE
WANTS TO PLAY GAMES.

232
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,493
>> TOO EARLY TO START PLAYING
GAMES AND HIDING STUFF.

233
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,960
>> RIGHT NOW,
I'M STRUGGLING EMOTIONALLY.

234
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,464
THIS GAME IS TURNING ME
INTO SOMEBODY I'M NOT.

235
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,757
AND IT'S DRAINING ON ME,

236
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,095
AND I'M REALIZING
THIS MIGHT NOT BE FOR ME.

237
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,556
I DID THINGS THAT I FEEL LIKE I
SHOULDN'T HAVE AND IT BOTHERS ME

238
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,267
SO I THINK IT'S BEST
IF I COME CLEAN.

239
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,936
CAN WE HAVE A TRIBE MEETING?

240
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,649
>> YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

241
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,902
>> I TOOK YOUR SHOES OUT OF
YOUR BAG, FILLED THEM WITH SAND,

242
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:39,448
AND I PUT THEM IN THE WATER.

243
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,950
I'M SORRY.

244
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,909
>> SHE STOLE MY SHOES?

245
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,120
SHE STOLE MY SHOES.

246
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,496
SHE STOLE THEM.

247
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,164
I WAS BORN AND RAISED
IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.

248
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,959
IF SHE WERE A GUY, I WOULD
HAVE KNOCKED HER RIGHT OUT.

249
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,253
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE NOT A GUY.

250
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,963
>> IT'S GOOD THAT THE TEAM
KNOWS THAT BECAUSE...

251
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,631
>> THAT'S WHY
I WANT YOU TO KNOW.

252
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,924
>> HOLLY KEEPS GETTING
STRANGER AND STRANGER.

253
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,261
AND EVERY TIME SHE SPEAKS,
IT BECOMES MORE EVIDENT

254
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,804
THAT SHE'S CRAZY.

255
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:06,267
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP ONE EYE
ON HER AND ONE EYE ON MY SHOES.

256
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,437
>> I WANT TO LEAVE THIS GAME
WITH HONESTY AND INTEGRITY.

257
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,814
>> AND THAT'S THE WAY YOU'RE
PLAYING IT FROM HERE FORWARD.

258
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,816
>> 100%.

259
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,526
>> I ACCEPT THAT.
>> 100%.

260
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,652
>> WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.

261
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,112
IT MAY BE EASY
FOR YOU TO ACCEPT.

262
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,155
>> UH-OH!

263
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,156
>> IT MAY BE EASY
FOR YOU TO ACCEPT.

264
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,243
I CAN'T TRUST HER.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN

265
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,246
BUT SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET
ANY FORGIVENESS FROM ME.

266
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,961
>> I AM SO EATEN ALIVE.

267
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:39,175
MY LEGS ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

268
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,801
WHO MOVED MY SOCKS?

269
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,470
WHO TOOK IT OUT OF MY SHOE.

270
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,138
>> I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

271
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,849
>> I HAD SOCKS IN MY SHOES,
ONE IN EACH SHOE,

272
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,018
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
ONE'S MISSING.

273
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,774
BITCHES.

274
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,527
>> I DOUBT ANYBODY
STOLE YOUR SOCKS.

275
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,906
>> NAONKA, SHE LOST ONE
OF HER SOCKS AND NOW SHE THINKS

276
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:02,990
SOMEBODY TOOK HER SOCKS
AND IS PLAYING TRICKS

277
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,659
WITH HER, WHICH IS CRAP.

278
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,996
>> YOU STARTING... WITH MY SOCKS
OR MY SHOES OR STUFF LIKE,

279
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,706
IT'S GOING TO GET REAL DIRTY.

280
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,000
IF THERE IS SOMEBODY
THAT IS EITHER AFTER ME,

281
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,877
SOMEBODY THAT IS
TRYING TO IRRITATE ME

282
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,087
AND THEY WANT TO PLAY DIRTY,
I CAN PLAY DIRTY, TOO.

283
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,925
SO I FOUND ANOTHER PAIR OF SOCKS
THAT WERE JUST SITTING THERE,

284
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,927
AND I TOOK THEM.

285
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,054
>> SHE TOOK
SOMEBODY ELSE'S SOCKS.

286
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,432
>> SHOWS CHARACTER.

287
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,143
>> SHOWS WHAT SHE REALLY IS.

288
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,146
>> I CAN'T FIND
MY SPARE PAIR OF SOCKS.

289
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,731
>> NA'S WEARING THEM, DUMMY.

290
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,899
>> IS SHE?
>> YEAH.

291
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,568
>> THAT MAKES ME MAD.

292
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,862
>> LAFLOR IS DEFINITELY
GETTING INTO SOME

293
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,447
HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA KIND OF STUFF

294
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,450
NAONKA SWEARS SOMEBODY
TRIED TO SABOTAGE HER SOCKS

295
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,578
WHICH IS CRAZY,
AND NOW SHE STOLE FABIO'S SOCK.

296
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,705
SHE'S JUST A LOOSE CANNON.

297
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,123
>> WHATCHA LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT FOR?

298
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,750
YOU AIN'T GOT TO HAVE
NO ATTITUDE.

299
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,752
>> I LOOKED AT YOU--
YOU SAID WHY YOU GOT LOOK...

300
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,254
>> WHY ARE YOU RAISING
YOUR VOICE AT ME?

301
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,922
I CAN GET LOUD, TOO.

302
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,800
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK HER
DO YOU THINK YOU ACCIDENTALLY

303
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,136
TOOK MY SOCKS BUT BEFORE I COULD
SAY ANYTHING, SHE WENT CRAZY.

304
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,806
YOU JUST CALLED ME OUT
IN THE MIDDLE...

305
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,557
>> I SURE DID.

306
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,560
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT JUD,

307
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,272
I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

308
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,440
>> I NEED THAT MASK, DUDE.

309
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,109
>> I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO THINK I'M LIKE A B-I-T-C-H,

310
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,111
BUT THE BOY IS STUPID.

311
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,074
(\LAUGHTER\)

312
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,951
>> IS MY DREADLOCK OKAY?

313
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,744
>> EVERYBODY THINKS
HIS JOKES IS FUNNY.

314
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,121
YEAH, WE'RE LAUGHING,
HEH-HEH-HEH.

315
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:37,293
I'M LAUGHING BECAUSE, HEH, HEH,
I'M ABOUT TO VOTE YOU OFF.

316
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,296
>> I CAN'T WAIT
FOR HER TO GO HOME, MAN.

317
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,930
>> YEAH.

318
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,307
>> I'M HAVING A HARD TIME.

319
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,142
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

320
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,061
AND EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED, TOO.

321
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,147
>> YOU KNOW, COMING INTO THIS
GAME, I WAS LIKE I CAN DO THIS.

322
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,650
AND THEN YOU GET HERE
AND IT'S THE WHOLE MENTAL GAME,

323
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,985
IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

324
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,486
>> RIGHT.

325
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,488
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT.

326
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,657
>> YOU CAN DO IT FOR ONE DAY,
CAN'T YOU?

327
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,159
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

328
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,870
>> IT CONCERNS ME
THAT HOLLY IS HAVING

329
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,204
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE GAME.

330
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:14,997
SHE'D LIKE TO GO HOME.

331
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,208
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK

332
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,628
IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO JUST YET.

333
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,130
>> I CAN'T DO IT.

334
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:29,345
I'VE NEVER FAILED ANYTHING IN MY
LIFE, BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

335
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,513
>> THIS IS NO DIFFERENT
THAN A FOOTBALL PLAYER

336
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,348
WANTING TO QUIT THE TEAM.

337
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,017
WE ALL GO THROUGH
SOME ADVERSE TIMES

338
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,519
AND, YOU KNOW,
OUR MINDS GET WEAK.

339
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,190
VINCE LOMBARDI SAYS FATIGUE
MAKES COWARDS OF US ALL.

340
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,691
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS OUT HERE.

341
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,694
THE ONLY THING I ASK YOU TO DO
IS GIVE IT YOUR BEST.

342
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,236
BUT WE NEED YOU.

343
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,073
WE REALLY DO NEED YOU.

344
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,534
>> I KNOW IF I QUIT THIS GAME,
I'LL BE LETTING MY TRIBE DOWN,

345
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,370
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP MY HEAD UP.

346
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,373
I'M GOING TO HELP THE TEAM OUT,
AND THE EMOTIONAL MELTDOWN

347
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,167
THAT I HAD TODAY
MIGHT EITHER CARRY ME THROUGH

348
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,836
OR IT'S GOING TO HURT ME.

349
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,964
I GUESS WE'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

350
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,555
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

351
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,562
>> HALT!

352
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,733
>> All: LA FLORA!

353
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,068
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE
GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK

354
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,737
AT THE NEW OLDER TRIBE.

355
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,199
WENDY VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

356
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,576
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY
TO GET TO TODAY'S CHALLENGE?

357
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,578
>> YEAH.
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST--

358
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,873
ALINA, I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

359
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,875
>> OH, BYE-BYE.

360
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,923
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN
IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

361
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,800
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
ON MY "GO,"

362
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,594
ONE PERSON FROM EACH TRIBE
WILL RACE THROUGH THE MUD

363
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,431
AND INTO A STACK OF HAY
LOOKING FOR A BALL.

364
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,308
ONCE YOU HAVE THE BALL,
YOU'LL DROP IT ON YOUR MAT,

365
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,935
AND THE NEXT PERSON GOES.

366
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,020
ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED
ALL FOUR BALLS,

367
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,606
THREE OTHER TRIBE MEMBERS
WILL USE WOODEN SHIELDS

368
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,316
TO BOUNCE ONE BALL
FROM PLAYER TO PLAYER

369
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,277
UNTIL IT LANDS IN YOUR BARREL.

370
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,947
FIRST TRIBE TO GET
ALL FOUR BALLS IN THEIR BARREL

371
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,282
WINS IMMUNITY
AND IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

372
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,784
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

373
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,620
WHERE SOMEBODY
WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

374
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,331
IN ADDITION, TODAY
YOU ARE PLAYING FOR REWARD.

375
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,291
AND YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

376
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,795
YOU CAN CHOOSE
BETWEEN A TARP WITH ROPE--

377
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,590
I DON'T CARE
HOW GOOD YOUR SHELTER IS,

378
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,426
A TARP WILL MAKE
A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

379
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,636
IF YOU DON'T WANT A TARP,

380
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,638
YOUR OTHER CHOICE
IS FISHING GEAR--

381
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,474
SNORKEL, FINS,
ALONG WITH A SPEAR.

382
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,767
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

383
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,101
>> YES.
>> YEAH!

384
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,978
>> Jeff: NOW
TO THE MEDALLION OF POWER,

385
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,521
OLDER TRIBE, YOU STILL HAVE IT.

386
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,315
IF YOU USE IT IN THIS CHALLENGE

387
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,150
YOUR ADVANTAGE WILL BE
YOU WILL START WITH ONE BALL

388
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,111
ALREADY IN YOUR BARREL.

389
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,697
THAT MEANS ONE LESS PERSON
GOING THROUGH THE MUD,

390
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,033
ONE LESS STACK OF HAY
TO DEAL WITH,

391
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,618
AND ONE LESS BALL TO BOUNCE

392
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,203
FROM SHIELD TO SHIELD
INTO YOUR BARREL.

393
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,621
IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU

394
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,123
TO SIT ONE WEAK PERSON
OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.

395
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,334
WHAT'S THE CALL?
ARE YOU GOING TO USE IT OR NOT?

396
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,002
>> I THINK IT'S
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

397
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:07,878
>> AND IT'S REWARD AND IMMUNITY.

398
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,755
>> Jeff: WHAT'S
THE CALL GOING TO BE?

399
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,132
>> WE'RE GOING TO USE IT.
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT.

400
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,509
ALL RIGHT,
THAT MEANS THE YOUNGER TRIBE

401
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,344
WILL GET THE CHANCE TO USE IT
AT THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

402
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,638
ONE OTHER ORDER OF BUSINESS--

403
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,223
YOUNGER TRIBE,
YOU HAVE ONE EXTRA MEMBER.

404
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,808
YOU'RE SITTING SOMEBODY OUT
OF THIS CHALLENGE--

405
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,975
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?

406
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,060
>> I'M SITTING OUT.

407
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,561
>> Jeff: NAONKA,
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

408
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,354
I'LL GIVE YOU GUYS
A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE

409
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,482
AND WE'LL GET STARTED.

410
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,865
ALL RIGHT, THE OLDER TRIBE
IS USING THE ADVANTAGE.

411
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,368
ONE PART OF THE ADVANTAGE
IS TO SIT SOMEBODY OUT.

412
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,869
DAN IS SITTING OUT.

413
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,246
THE OTHER ADVANTAGE
IS YOU START WITH ONE BALL

414
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,540
ALREADY IN THE BARREL.

415
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,417
OLDER TRIBE HAS
THEIR FIRST BALL IN THE BARREL.

416
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,379
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE IF THE
ADVANTAGE MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

417
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:55,259
FOR IMMUNITY AND REWARD,
SURVIVORS READY?

418
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,719
GO!

419
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,888
BRENDA THROUGH THE MUD QUICKLY.

420
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,265
JIMMY JOHNSON THROUGH THE MUD.

421
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:05,227
THEY'RE BOTH OUT
AT THE SAME TIME.

422
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,063
BOTH BRENDA AND JIMMY
COVERED IN MUD,

423
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:12,901
LOOKING FOR A BALL
IN A STACK OF HAY.

424
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,404
JIMMY HAS THE BALL
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE!

425
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,865
BRENDA HAS THE BALL
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE!

426
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,575
GO OLDER, GO YOUNGER.

427
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,619
JANE NOW IN THE MUD
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

428
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,706
PURPLE KELLY IN THE MUD
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

429
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,752
OLDER TRIBE
WITH A ONE-BALL ADVANTAGE.

430
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,421
>> RIGHT NEAR THE BOTTOM, KELLY,
RIGHT NEAR THE BOTTOM.

431
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,550
>> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY HAS IT
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

432
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,304
GO, YOUNGER TRIBE!

433
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,432
ALINA NOW IN THE MUD
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

434
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,559
JANE HAS THE BALL
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

435
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,476
>> GO, ALINA!

436
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,479
>> LET'S GO, ALINA.

437
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:54,109
>> Jeff: HOLLY NOW FOR THE OLDER
TRIBE, FACE-FIRST IN THE MUD.

438
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,611
ALINA NOT MESSING AROUND.

439
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,155
SHE HAS THE THIRD BALL
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

440
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,615
THEY'RE MAKING UP TIME.

441
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,782
GO!

442
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,492
KELLY B. NOW ON THE COURSE.

443
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,787
HOLLY LOOKING FOR THAT
FINAL BALL FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

444
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,123
KELLY BRUNO TREKKING
THROUGH THAT MUD,

445
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,126
ARTIFICIAL LEG
NOT BOTHERING HER AT ALL.

446
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,629
KELLY LOOKING FOR THAT
FOURTH AND FINAL BALL

447
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,672
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

448
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,761
THE YOUNGER TRIBE
HAS ALL FOUR BALLS.

449
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,931
HOLLY CANNOT FIND THE BALL
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

450
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,808
CHASE UNRAVELING THAT BALL
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

451
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,812
YOU GOTTA BOUNCE YOUR BALL
FROM ONE SHIELD TO ANOTHER.

452
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,148
HOLLY HAS THE BALL
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

453
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,316
>> GO, GO, GO!

454
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,318
>> Jeff: THE BIG ADVANTAGE
IN THIS CHALLENGE

455
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,321
IS THAT THE OLDER TRIBE
ONLY HAS THREE BALLS

456
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,864
THEY NEED TO GET IN THE BARREL.

457
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,908
THE YOUNGER TRIBE
HAS FOUR BALLS.

458
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,534
BENRY HAS A SHOT
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

459
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,662
AND HE SCORES.

460
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,164
YOUNGER TRIBE ON THE BOARD
WITH THEIR FIRST BALL.

461
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,375
THE OLDER TRIBE
LOST THEIR ADVANTAGE.

462
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,044
WE ARE NOW EVEN.

463
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,462
MARTY TO JIMMY T.

464
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,549
JIMMY T. TO TYRONE.

465
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,552
IF YOU DROP YOUR BALL, IT'S
GOT TO GO BACK TO THE START.

466
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,429
IT'S ALL ON BENRY RIGHT NOW.

467
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,556
AND HE SCORES AGAIN.

468
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,851
THEY NOW HAVE TWO BALLS
IN THEIR BARREL.

469
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,521
IT TAKES FOUR TO WIN.

470
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,191
NICE BOUNCE AND SAVE BY TYRONE.

471
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,652
TYRONE SCORES
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE!

472
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:22,072
WE ARE TIED, TWO-TWO.

473
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,826
BENRY JUST SHORT
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

474
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,869
JIMMY T. TO TYRONE.

475
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,705
TYRONE HAS ANOTHER SHOT.

476
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,833
THIS WILL BE THE THIRD BALL
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

477
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,502
TYRONE SCORES AGAIN
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

478
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,380
OLDER TRIBE HAS ONE BALL LEFT.

479
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,590
BENRY WITH A SHOT
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

480
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,050
HE MISSES AGAIN.

481
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,678
THE OLDER TRIBE
WAS GIVEN A ONE-BALL ADVANTAGE,

482
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,556
AND THAT IS PROVING
TO BE HUGE RIGHT NOW.

483
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,391
FABIO TO BENRY.

484
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,642
BENRY GOTTA GET ONE IN
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

485
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,937
TYRONE COULD WIN IT
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

486
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,400
IMMUNITY AND REWARD.

487
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,651
>> GET IN!
>> GOSH!

488
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,571
>> Jeff: TYRONE SCORES AND WINS
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE,

489
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,783
IMMUNITY AND REWARD!

490
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,577
>> THAT'S WHAT I CALL
KICKING ASS.

491
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,747
>> LET'S DO IT, OLD SCHOOL!

492
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,416
>> OLD SCHOOL RULES!

493
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,585
>> WE USED THE MEDALLION OF
POWER TO GET AN ADVANTAGE,

494
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,961
WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEEDED.

495
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
ONCE WE SAW THE ADVANTAGE
THAT IT GAVE US,

496
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,424
AND BEING THAT IT WAS A DUAL
CHALLENGE, IT WAS A NO-BRAINER.

497
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,385
WE WON, SO IT REALLY COULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN BETTER FOR US.

498
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,595
>> Jeff: OLDER TRIBE,
CONGRATULATIONS.

499
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,764
(whooping, applause)

500
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,892
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

501
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,601
NOBODY GOING HOME
FROM THE OLDER TRIBE.

502
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,811
YES, SIR.

503
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,480
NOW, YOU HAVE A DECISION-- YOUR
CHOICE BETWEEN TWO REWARDS.

504
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,608
YOU HAVE THE TARP,
OR YOU HAVE FISHING GEAR.

505
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,567
>> FISHING GEAR.
>> FISHING.

506
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,944
>> Jeff: COME GET IT.

507
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,613
EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO CATCH FISH IN THERE.

508
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,282
YOU CAN GRAB YOUR STUFF
AND HEAD ON BACK TO CAMP.

509
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,617
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

510
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,077
>> ESPADA!

511
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,536
(\CHEERS\)

512
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,164
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

513
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:54,956
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

514
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,917
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL

515
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,960
WHERE YOU WILL VOTE OUT
YOUR FIRST MEMBER.

516
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,003
>> WE THOUGHT
BEING THE YOUNG GUYS--

517
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,965
WE COULD DOMINATE THE GAME
FROM START TO FINISH.

518
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,842
SO TODAY WAS A HUGE SHOCK
AND A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT

519
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,844
FOR OUR TRIBE, AND,
UNFORTUNATELY,

520
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,970
NOW WE HAVE
TO SEND SOMEONE HOME TONIGHT,

521
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,640
AND I'M REALLY NOT SURE
HOW THAT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT.

522
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,564
(\CHEERS\)

523
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,150
>> WE CAN DO IT!

524
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,945
(whooping)

525
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:28,156
>> TO WIN THE CHALLENGE TODAY,
I WON'T LIE--

526
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,159
THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF
WHEN WE WON IS

527
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,286
WHAT IF I WOULD HAVE LEFT?

528
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,499
IT PROVES THAT IF YOU DON'T
QUIT, THE PAYOFF WILL BE HUGE.

529
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:42,379
>> HOLLY-- SHE SEEMS TO BE DOING
EXTREMELY WELL NOW.

530
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,214
EVERYBODY'S GOT
THEIR FINGERS CROSSED

531
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,632
THAT SHE'LL GET BACK
ON THE PAGE,

532
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,926
BUT MY PAST EXPERIENCE
WITH INDIVIDUALS

533
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,636
THAT HAVE HAD SETBACKS
LIKE THAT,

534
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,889
YOU KNOW, IT'S EASIER
TO HAVE THE SECOND SETBACK.

535
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,976
AND SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
A CONTINUAL PROCESS WITH HER.

536
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,894
>> LET'S SEE WHAT'S IN HERE?

537
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,396
>> LET'S CHECK OUT
WHAT'S IN HERE, GUYS.

538
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,272
>> OH!

539
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,648
>> JANE, YOU'RE GOING FISHING.
>> MAN!

540
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,066
>> UH-OH, WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

541
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,693
>> INSTRUCTIONS?
>> OH, BOY.

542
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,570
>> GO.

543
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,531
"THIS IS A CLUE
TO A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

544
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,699
"IT IS UP TO YOU

545
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,534
WHETHER YOU SHARE THIS
INFORMATION WITH ANYONE ELSE."

546
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,161
>> WHEN WE OPENED UP
OUR FISHING GEAR,

547
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,662
THERE WAS A CLUE THERE
FOR A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

548
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,540
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PUZZLE,
BUT,

549
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,541
I'M A FISHERMAN,

550
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,376
SO I IMMEDIATELY FIGURED OUT
THE MIDDLE ONE.

551
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,878
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS UNDER
THAT TOP CROSS,

552
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,171
PIECE OF A MAST IS A YARD...

553
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,547
OH, MINUS ARM,
SO IT'S "YARD."

554
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,215
>> 15...

555
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,759
>> IT'S 15 YARDS WEST
OF THE MAN TREE.

556
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,386
>> 15 YARDS WEST
OF THE TREE MAN.

557
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,095
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S PROBABLY, LIKE,

558
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,556
A SPECIFIC TREE, LIKE, AROUND...

559
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,059
>> IT'S 15 YARDS DUE WEST OF
WHATEVER TREE YOU THINK IT IS.

560
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,353
>> AND WEST IS REMOTELY
ABOUT THAT ROCK.

561
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,230
>> INITIALLY,
WE FIGURED OUT THE CLUE.

562
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,525
SAID, "DIG 15 FEET WEST
OF A MAN IN A TREE."

563
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,111
SO EVERYONE JUST STARTED
FRANTICALLY DIGGING

564
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,531
AROUND RANDOM TREES, WHICH IS,
LIKE, EXHAUSTING, YOU KNOW.

565
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,117
SO I LOOKED AT AND LOOKED AT IT,
AND I'M LIKE,

566
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,368
"TREE MAN, TREE MAN."

567
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,703
AND THEN IT WAS, LIKE,
JUST HIT ME.

568
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,579
TREE MAIL.
THERE IT IS.

569
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,081
IT'S 15 FEET WEST OF TREE MAIL.

570
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:00,749
IT'S TREE MAN, TREE MAIL.

571
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,043
GO GET IT.

572
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,128
MARTY IS A SMART GUY
WITH GOOD IDEAS,

573
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,630
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD PAY OFF
IN THE LONG RUN

574
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,675
TO GAIN MARTY'S TRUST
BY SHARING THAT WITH HIM.

575
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,682
>> I WAS REALLY SHOCKED
THAT JILL GAVE ME THE KEY CLUE,

576
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,436
AND DANNY WAS WITH ME
WHEN JILL CAME UP,

577
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,479
SO HE'S INVOLVED NOW,

578
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,439
BUT I LIKE HIM, AND I THINK
HE COULD BE PIVOTAL.

579
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,649
HE COULD BE DANGEROUS LATER,

580
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,235
BUT I THINK HE COULD BE PIVOTAL
IF WE FIND THAT IDOL.

581
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,069
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
AM I IN THE RIGHT AREA?

582
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,447
>> 25 FEET.
WE GOT TO BE RIGHT HERE.

583
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,282
>> WORK WITH ME.
>> I'M WORKING.

584
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,825
>> I THINK THE TRIBE
NEEDS A JOLT.

585
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,953
I THINK WE NEED A DRAMATIC SHIFT

586
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,746
TO GET PEOPLE WHIPPED UP
AND IN LINE.

587
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,456
>> ENOUGH PEOPLE
HAVE SEEN US HERE.

588
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,290
WE GOT TO FIND THIS THING.

589
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,792
EVERYBODY WILL BE BACK HERE
DIGGING.

590
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,252
WE GOT TO FIND IT.

591
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,003
>> GOT TO KEEP DIGGING.
WE CAN'T GIVE UP, I GUESS.

592
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,255
>> WE I KNOW IT'S HERE.

593
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,257
>> I KNOW WE MUST BE CLOSE.

594
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,633
>> IT'S RIGHT HERE.

595
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,636
>> OH!

596
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,764
THE IDOL.
JILL, I GOT IT IT.

597
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,891
I GOT THE IDOL, BABY.

598
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,018
I GOT THE FIRST...
WE GOT THE IDOL.

599
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,896
>> WE GOT THE IDOL.
>> DO NOT FORGET, WE GOT IT.

600
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,897
I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND
THE IDOL

601
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,984
IF JILL HAD NOT GIVEN THE CLUE
ABOUT TREE MAIL,

602
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,151
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

603
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,529
JILL, THIS IS SO MONEY.

604
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,864
SO THE CHALLENGE NOW IS,
HOW DO WE MAKE IT WORK?

605
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,331
>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE FUN
TONIGHT.

606
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,000
>> I KNOW.

607
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,710
>> I DON'T LIKE THIS.

608
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,670
>> BLAME THE MEDALLION.
>> YEAH.

609
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,130
>> BLAME THAT ONE BALL.
>> RIGHT.

610
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,923
>> IT'S THE BEST THING
WE CAN DO. >> RIGHT.

611
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,216
>> THOSE GIRLS ARE SAVAGE.

612
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,718
>> THEY WERE AWESOME.

613
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,015
>> ...WORRIED ABOUT,
BUT SHE DOMINATED IT.

614
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,142
>> WE HAD A GOOD CHALLENGE TODAY
SO THAT YOU COULD FINALLY SHOW

615
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,645
THAT YOU'RE JUST AS ATHLETIC
AS THE REST OF US.

616
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,731
>> TODAY I SAT OUT
AT THE CHALLENGE

617
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,357
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE
IF KELLY B.

618
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,191
WAS GOING TO USE HER LEG
AS AN EXCUSE

619
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,610
BECAUSE IT WAS
A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE.

620
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,821
I WAS VERY PROUD OF HER, THE
FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T DO THAT.

621
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,866
I MEAN, SHE'S JUST...
SHE'S JUST AWESOME.

622
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,701
I DON'T LIKE HER,
BUT SHE'S JUST AWESOME.

623
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,535
>> WHO ARE WE VOTING? NAY.

624
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,829
>> WE'RE EITHER GOING BRENDA
OR NAY.

625
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,710
>> WELL, SEE THAT'S WHY IT WILL
BE EASY TO GET RID OF HER LATER.

626
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,962
>> EXACTLY, BUT I THINK
IT SHOULD BE BRENDA NOW.

627
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,799
>> I THINK BRENDA DEFINITELY HAS
A THING FOR CHASE,

628
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,176
BECAUSE THEY HANG OUT A LOT.

629
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:16,885
SO WE'RE KIND OF WORRIED
ABOUT THEM

630
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,887
'CAUSE HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY AND,

631
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,722
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOING
TO TELL HER THINGS.

632
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,599
AND THEY MIGHT TRY
TO WORK THAT ANGLE,

633
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,809
SO WE HAVE TO BREAK THAT UP.

634
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,770
(snorting)

635
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,940
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
WHO I WANT TO GET RID OF.

636
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,611
I WANT TO WRITE DOWN NAONKA,
MAN.

637
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,946
>> CHASE?

638
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,740
>> WHO ARE YOU WRITING DOWN?

639
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,452
>> EVERYBODY SAID
THEY'RE WRITING DOWN NAY.

640
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,787
>> WHY?

641
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,415
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE EMOTIONAL, DOESN'T IT?

642
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,416
>> WHO DO YOU THINK
WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE?

643
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,710
>> I THINK BRENDA'S
GONNA BE MORE OF A THREAT.

644
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,878
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT THAT OUT THERE.

645
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:56,591
>> CHASE IS CONSTANTLY GOING OFF
ON BRENDA ALL THE TIME.

646
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,219
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GETTING
BLINDED BY A WOMAN,

647
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,597
BUT KELLY B. AND ALINA--
THEY'RE KIND OF NERVOUS,

648
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,932
AND I'M GETTING KIND OF WORRIED
ABOUT BRENDA, TOO.

649
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,396
>> ...THEY'RE STRUGGLING
RIGHT NOW.

650
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,564
THEY HAVE THREE,
AND THEY HAVE FOUR WITH SASH.

651
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,982
THEY NEED YOU ALL TWO.

652
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,276
WHY DO YOU THINK
BRENDA'S CLINGING TO YOU?

653
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,986
SHE'S TRYING TO PLAY YOUR ASS,

654
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,947
AND WE'RE TOO STRONG OF A TRIBE
TO GO SCREW THIS ALL UP

655
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,366
AND GO LOSE TO SOME OLD ASSES.

656
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,202
>> BUT WE GOT
TO TAKE BRENDA OUT FIRST.

657
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,787
>> I HATE TO PUT YOU
IN THAT POSITION

658
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,455
BY VOTING BRENDA
BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR GIRL, BUT...

659
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,289
>> RIGHT.

660
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,791
I AM DEFINITELY
IN A MESS RIGHT NOW.

661
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,794
EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THIS GAME,

662
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,838
I PRAYED THAT GOD COULD GIVE ME
SOMEONE THAT I COULD TRUST,

663
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,258
AND I FEEL THAT BRENDA WAS THAT
PERSON RIGHT FROM THE START.

664
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,844
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH SHANNON.

665
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,764
AND NOW HE WANTS BRENDA
SENT HOME FIRST.

666
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,808
SO, I'M CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF TWO DIFFERENT ALLIANCES.

667
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,478
AND I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

668
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,938
>> I JUST WANT TO SECURE US
TO GO TO THE FINAL THING.

669
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,649
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO.

670
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,444
CHASE-- HE KIND OF FEELS BAD
ABOUT SENDING BRENDA HOME

671
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,028
'CAUSE OF HER FEELINGS,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

672
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,864
BUT CHASE IS MY NUMBER ONE GUY.

673
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,824
AND IF MY ALLIANCES ARE DOING
WHAT THEY SAY THEY'RE DOING,

674
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,910
THEN, BRENDA'S THE FIRST ONE
TO GO.

675
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,639
>> HE'S TALKING TO EVERYBODY
TELLING EVERYBODY OFF...

676
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,016
>> YEAH. IS HE TALKING TO YOU?

677
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,350
>> HE HAS NOT SAID
ANYTHING TO ME.

678
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,560
>> IS HE'S TALKING TO ME?

679
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:30,935
>> RIGHT.
>> THERE YOU GO.

680
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,318
>> ME, TOO. HE'S A PUPPY.
>> YEAH.

681
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,195
>> THE SECOND PERSON I WANT IS--
WHAT'S HIS NAM-- JUDE, JUD?

682
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,030
>> YEAH.
>> GONE.

683
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,365
>> I LIKE YOUR LIST.

684
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,910
>> YESTERDAY,
I WENT OFF ON FABIO,

685
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:47,869
AND IT WAS JUST BECAUSE
HE RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY.

686
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,747
I CAN'T STAND HIM.
HE CAN'T STAND ME.

687
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,375
SO, I WANT FABIO OUT OF HERE,
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO OUT,

688
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,003
LIKE, TONIGHT, BECAUSE HE'S NOT
A THREAT TO ANYONE.

689
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:00,173
BUT SHANNON-- HE'S MAKING
HIMSELF A THREAT RIGHT NOW,

690
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,050
TALKING TO EVERYBODY.

691
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,635
AND I'M, LIKE,
"YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

692
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,387
"OKAY, WELL, JUST KNOW YOU HAVE
BUILT YOUR OWN STEPPING STONE

693
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,264
TO THE GRAVE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL."

694
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,183
SASH-- HE HASN'T TALKED TO YOU

695
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,392
ABOUT WHAT HE TALKED TO ME
ABOUT.

696
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,560
>> WHICH IS WHAT?

697
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,522
>> HE WANTS TO BRING ALL OF US
MINORITIES TO THE END.

698
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:15,980
DID HE TELL YOU THAT?

699
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,899
>> NO.
>> YEAH.

700
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,234
I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO HIM ABOUT IT.

701
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,528
>> THAT IS HIS PLAN.
>> I LIKE SASH.

702
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,529
>> YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S FUNNY?

703
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,281
I HAVE PEOPLE ON MY SIDE
WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING.

704
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,158
I GET A GOOD VIBE FROM NAY.

705
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,577
SASH WAS SAYING HOW HE WANTS
TO BE AN ALLIANCE.

706
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,079
I FEEL LIKE I CAN GET
KELLY PURPLE.

707
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,332
AND I'M REALLY TIGHT WITH CHASE.
THAT MAKES FIVE.

708
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,751
>> CHASE TALKS TO ME,
AND I FEEL LIKE HE'S REAL.

709
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,128
>> YEAH: >> I DO FEEL LIKE
HE'S NERVOUS, THOUGH.

710
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,880
>> I THOUGHT HE WAS
HE WAS STRONGER THAN THAT.

711
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,925
>> HE'S NOT, AND IT'S A SHAME
BECAUSE WE COULD RULE THIS.

712
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,134
>> LIKE, DO I HAVE YOUR WORD?

713
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,386
>> DEFINITELY.

714
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,514
>> WE'RE TAKING SHANNON OUT.

715
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,434
>> THAT ONE RIGHT THERE.
>> YEAH.

716
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:58,106
>> THEY HAVE SHANNON, ALINA,
FABIO, BEN, AND KB.

717
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,818
AND THEY SAID
THEY WANT YOU GONE FIRST.

718
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,945
I'M SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW.

719
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,280
EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THIS GAME,

720
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,657
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO I CAN TRUST

721
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,117
AND WHO
I CAN PLAY THE GAME WITH.

722
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,453
I LIKED SHANNON RIGHT AWAY, AND
HE WANTED TO BE ALIGNED WITH ME,

723
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,413
BUT NOW THERE'S JUST A FEELING

724
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,790
THAT I HAVE
THAT'S NOT RIGHT ABOUT HIM.

725
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,250
I DID NOT WANT
TO PLAY THE GAME THIS WAY.

726
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,085
I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE
TO COME IN, NOT TALK MUCH...

727
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,837
>> WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT SHANNON IS THE ONE

728
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,130
CALLING ALL THE SHOTS,

729
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,799
SO WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST WANT
TO TAKE HIM OUT FIRST?

730
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,967
WHY DO YOU NEED HIM?

731
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,468
TELL ME A GOOD REASON
WHY YOU NEED HIM.

732
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,928
>> I DON'T NEED HIM AT ALL.

733
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,721
>> SO, THEN WHY
WOULD YOU KEEP HIM?

734
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,097
>> HE'S THE ONE
CALLING THE SHOTS.

735
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,348
>> VERY TRUE, THAT'S RIGHT.

736
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,058
>> HE'S THE ONE TALKING
AND MOTIVATING PEOPLE

737
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,810
AND WHISPERING THINGS
IN THEIR EAR.

738
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,187
SO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
WOULDN'T TAKE HIM OUT FIRST.

739
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,274
>> WELL, WE COULD.
NUMBERS, YOU, ME, UM...

740
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,817
>> PURPLE.
>> KELLY PURPLE.

741
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,444
>> SASH? NAY?
>> AND NAY.

742
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,945
>> I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT

743
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,363
SOMEONE TO COME UP
TO ME AND SAY,

744
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,991
"SHANNON WANTS YOU OUT FIRST."

745
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,619
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
REALLY WHY.

746
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,955
BUT CHASE-- I THINK
HE WANTS TO KEEP ME HERE

747
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,332
BECAUSE HE JUST TRUSTS ME.

748
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,500
BUT IT'S LOOKING LIKE
IT WILL BE A TIE--

749
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,628
FIVE FOR ME,
AND FIVE FOR SHANNON--

750
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,380
SO WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

751
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,007
>> WHEN I HEARD
THEIR CONVERSATION,

752
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,301
I WAS LIKE, "WE'RE SCREWED."

753
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,846
BRENDA CONVINCED CHASE
TO GO FOR SHANNON,

754
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,140
SO BRENDA HAS HIM
BY THE COJONES,

755
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,183
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

756
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,895
GUYS, CHASE IS WITH THEM.

757
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,355
>> ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

758
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,856
>> YEAH!
BRENDA STIRRED IT UP.

759
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,732
>> BRENDA STIRRED IT UP.

760
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,692
>> BRENDA IS SO MUCH MORE
OF A THREAT.

761
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,320
SHE HAS HER LITTLE CHARM ON HIM,
I'M TELLING YOU.

762
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,905
>> THIS SUCKS, MAN.

763
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,073
NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS.

764
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,532
>> NO.

765
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,950
>> WE'RE STILL NOT SURE
ABOUT CHASE, MAN,

766
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,494
AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS.

767
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,704
AND WE'RE WONDERING
IF CHASE IS GOING TO LIE

768
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,789
TO BRENDA AND VOTE HER OUT,

769
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:41,584
OR TELL THE FOUR OF US
ONE THING, AND THEN FLIP.

770
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,460
>> CHASE IS WITH THEM.

771
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,546
IF YOU GO FIRST,
WE'RE DONE, ALL OF US.

772
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,214
LOOK HOW MUCH DRAMA
SHE STIRRED UP IN A DAY.

773
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,258
>> I KNOW!

774
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,219
>> YOU KNOW, IT WENT FROM US
BEING SIX STRONG

775
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,262
TO, LIKE, NOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WHAT.

776
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,681
I DON'T KNOW
WHO'S IN MY ALLIANCE.

777
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,015
I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST.

778
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,517
IF CHASE IS A MAN OF HIS WORD,

779
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,727
THEN BRENDA WILL GO HOME
TONIGHT.

780
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,104
IF NOT, I HAVE A BIG TARGET
ON MY BACK.

781
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,231
>> SOMEBODY WILL BE EATING
PEANUT BUTTER

782
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,900
AND JELLY SANDWICHES TONIGHT.

783
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,318
>> SOMEBODY WILL BE.

784
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,546
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU
IS A TORCH.

785
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,131
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH
AND APPROACH A FLAME.

786
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,258
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

787
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,803
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL
OF TRIBAL COUNCIL

788
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,222
BECAUSE FIRE REPRESENTS
YOUR LIFE.

789
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,099
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FIRE,
YOU'RE STILL IN THE GAME.

790
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,270
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE,
SO ARE YOU.

791
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,106
WELCOME TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

792
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,108
SO, SHANNON, HOW MUCH
MORE DIFFICULT

793
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,444
HAS THIS ADVENTURE BEEN
THAN YOU ANTICIPATED?

794
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,945
>> OH, IT'S BEEN BRUTAL.

795
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,238
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN CAMPING
A DAY IN MY LIFE

796
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,281
SO THIS IS THE WORST THING
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.

797
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,450
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GOTTEN BETTER.

798
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,617
I'M HERE. I'LL WING IT OUT.

799
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,287
BUT IT'S BEEN INTERESTING.
WE'VE HAD PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

800
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,623
SAY WE'RE ALL TOGETHER,
AND THEN I'M COMING TO FIND OUT

801
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,460
THERE'S NO LOYALTY.
SO WE'LL SEE.

802
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,712
HE BETTER HOPE HIS GIRLFRIEND
STAYS WITH HIM ON THIS TRIBE

803
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,505
TONIGHT BECAUSE IF NOT,
HE'LL BE GOING HOME NEXT.

804
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,631
>> Jeff: WOW!

805
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,841
>> HE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.

806
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,676
>> Jeff: WHO'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

807
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,719
>> I GUESS-- I GUESS--

808
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:15,970
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S BRENDA.

809
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:17,013
>> SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

810
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,557
FROM DAY ONE I TRUSTED BRENDA
AND I TRUSTED BEN.

811
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,769
THOSE WERE THE TWO PEOPLE
I TRUSTED THE MOST.

812
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:23,770
>> Jeff: SHANNON?

813
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,979
>> CAN I SAY WHY IT'S LIKE THIS?

814
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,315
I THOUGHT CHASE HAD MY BACK
AND I THOUGHT WE WERE THERE

815
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,317
AND WE'RE NOT NOT
AND IT PISSES ME OFF.

816
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,360
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS BE HONEST
AND SAY YOU'RE WITH HER.

817
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,696
>> I'M COMING OUT
WITH THE TRUTH.

818
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,366
I'VE BEEN BETWEEN TWO ALLIANCES
AND BEFORE WE CAME OUT HERE

819
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,203
I WAS VERY, VERY UNSURE
WHO I WANTED TO VOTE FOR,

820
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:45,166
WHETHER I WANTED TO VOTE
FOR SHANNON OR VOTE OFF BRENDA.

821
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,793
THAT'S AS HONEST AS YOU CAN GET.

822
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,836
>> YOU START OFF WITH ALL
YOUR INTEGRITY AND LOYALTY.

823
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,087
WHERE'S IT BEEN?

824
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,673
YOU'VE BEEN LYING
AND GOING BOTH WAYS.

825
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,803
>> Jeff: I'VE GOT TO SAY,
21 SEASONS OF "SURVIVOR,"

826
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,680
NEVER HAD AN OPENING QUESTION
OPEN THAT MUCH WHOOP-ASS

827
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,682
ON A TRIBE EVER.

828
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,476
>> I JUST WANT EVERYBODY
TO KNOW HOW UPSET I AM.

829
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,230
BECAUSE I GAVE MY WORD.

830
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,856
>> Jeff: WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE, JUD?

831
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,234
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL
SHANNON TO NOT MAKE ENEMIES.

832
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,362
HE JUST GETS AGGRESSIVE SO QUICK
AND I'M TRYING TO TELL HIM,

833
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,363
THAT'S NOT SMART, MAN.

834
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,698
>> FABIO, HOME BOY IS TRYING
TO VOTE ME OUT.

835
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,866
I'M NOT MAKING AN ENEMY.

836
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,161
HE KNOWS IF THAT DOESN'T GO DOWN
TONIGHT HE GOES NEXT.

837
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,498
>> Jeff: BRENDA, CONVENIENTLY
YOU ARE CENTERED IN THE MIDDLE

838
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,876
OF THIS WHOLE THING WITH SHANNON
LOSING HIS MIND BEHIND YOU.

839
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,878
>> I THINK IT JUST SHOWS
A CERTAIN WEAKNESS

840
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,004
HAS BEEN EXPOSED.

841
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,340
IT'S HARD TO TRUST HIM.

842
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,092
>> NOBODY HERE TRUSTS YOU, BUD.

843
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,218
>> FABIO, YOU DON'T TRUST ME?

844
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,386
>> I DO, MAN.

845
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,055
>> YOU DON'T TRUST ME?
I TOLD YOU TO VOTE ONE WAY?

846
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:43,224
HOW ABOUT ALINA, KB,
HAVE I LIED TO YOU ALL?

847
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,518
>> I TRUST YOU.

848
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,061
>> I'M NOT LYING TO ANYBODY.

849
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:50,064
>> Jeff: BUT, SHANNON, DO YOU
UNDERSTAND WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE

850
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:54,235
THE WISEST MOVE TO THROW IT
ALL OUT HERE BEFORE A VOTE?

851
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,237
>> I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHEN I AM UPSET

852
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,738
AND SOMEBODY HAS BETRAYED ME
LIKE THAT

853
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,073
I'LL SPEAK MY MIND
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

854
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,701
>> YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH DIGGING
YOUR OWN GRAVE.

855
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,786
>> I'M GONNA GET THIS OUT
OF THE WAY-- ARE YOU GAY?

856
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,421
>> I'M SURE I'VE HAD A LOT MORE
BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIENDS

857
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,590
THAN YOU HAVE, BUDDY.

858
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,383
>> YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T,
MY BROTHER, BUT GOOD LUCK.

859
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,384
TRUST ME, YOU HAVEN'T.

860
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,385
>> I'M 100%.

861
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,761
>> TRUST ME.

862
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,763
>> I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU WORK
YOUR MAGIC IN NEW YORK.

863
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,601
>> NEW YORK IS FULL
OF A BUNCH OF GAY PEOPLE.

864
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,561
>> Jeff: NEW YORK
IS FULL OF GAY PEOPLE.

865
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,313
>> THEY GOT A LOT OF THEM, JEFF,
MORE THAN IN LOUISIANA.

866
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,648
>> BE QUIET, DUDE!

867
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,443
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM
FOR THE NEXT TWO, THREE WEEKS.

868
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,070
>> Jeff: FABIO, GET YOUR HEAD
OUT OF THE TREES.

869
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,947
THIS IS A TRIBE
COMPLETELY DIVIDED

870
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,824
AND IF EXPERIENCE
MEANS ANYTHING,

871
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,119
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH SAILING
FOR YOU GUYS.

872
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:48,456
ALINA, IS IT FOOLISH TO BELIEVE
YOU CAN TRUST SOMEBODY

873
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,959
SIX DAYS IN
OF A MILLION-DOLLAR GAME.

874
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,252
>> IT'S VERY FOOLISH.

875
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,754
I THOUGHT I TRUSTED CHASE, TOO.

876
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,298
AND IT'S FUNNY EVERYBODY IS
SAYING SHANNON IS THE ONE

877
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,508
NOBODY CAN TRUST BUT SHANNON
HASN'T SAID A LIE TO ME

878
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,511
BUT CHASE HAS.

879
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,474
>> SURPRISED TRUST IS THIS BIG
OF AN ISSUE THIS FAST?

880
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,643
>> ABSOLUTELY.

881
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,437
IT HAPPENED SO FAST HOW THERE
WAS ALL OF A SUDDEN

882
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,356
TWO ALLIANCES AND YOU WERE
EITHER ON THIS SIDE

883
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,941
OR THIS SIDE.

884
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,445
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO
TO TRUST ANYMORE, EITHER.

885
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,322
>> Jeff: BRENDA,
WHY ARE YOU A TARGET?

886
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,200
>> I'M GUESSING IT'S BECAUSE
SHANNON WANTS TO TAKE OUT

887
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,661
A STRONG GIRL, BUT I FIND IT
HARD TO BELIEVE

888
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,329
HE WOULD CHOOSE SOMEONE LIKE ME
BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT,

889
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,539
YOU KNOW, SITTING HERE
PLOTTING ALL DAY LONG.

890
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,376
>> THE THING IS, JEFF,
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ON THE TRIBE

891
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,002
THOUGHT SHE WAS A THREAT,
NOT JUST ME.

892
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,837
AND EVEN TODAY, IT WAS NAY.

893
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,506
AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK,
AND THEN IT CHANGED

894
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,508
BECAUSE WE FELT BRENDA
WOULD BE THE BIGGER THREAT

895
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,385
TO THE OTHER GIRLS
IN OUR ALLIANCE.

896
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,469
>> Jeff: NAONKA,
IS THAT NEWS TO YOU?

897
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,347
>> I THOUGHT MAYBE IF THEY WERE
GONNA VOTE ME OUT

898
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,557
IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO
THE CHALLENGE TODAY

899
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,977
AND I WAS HOPING WE WERE GOING
TO WIN SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE

900
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,687
TO BE HERE
BECAUSE WE WERE STRONG.

901
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,355
WE WERE A UNIT.

902
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,107
>> Jeff: YOU WERE NOT TIGHT,
NAONKA,

903
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,525
AND IF YOU'RE STILL
THINKING YOU ARE,

904
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,986
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THE TREE
FABIO IS UP IN.

905
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,487
>> OH, I DON'T WANT
TO BE IN THAT TREE.

906
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,989
>> Jeff: SO YOU DON'T LIKE
FABIO?

907
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,198
>> NOPE.

908
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,992
>> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS?

909
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,035
>> EVERY TIME I SAY SOMETHING
TO HIM

910
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,454
HE HAS SOMETHING SMART TO SAY
LIKE I'M DUMB.

911
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,207
AND I'M NOT AFRAID
TO SAY HOW I FEEL ABOUT FABIO.

912
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,418
FABIO, I DON'T LIKE YOU.

913
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,585
>> Jeff: OKAY.

914
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,338
FABIO, SHE DON'T LIKE YOU.

915
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,716
>> THAT ATTITUDE HAS BEEN
PRESENT THE WHOLE TIME.

916
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,550
AND I HAVE TRIED
TO KEEP IT COOL,

917
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,219
BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY HARD
TO DO THAT.

918
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,263
>> HE DON'T TRY HARD ENOUGH.

919
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,724
>> Jeff: NAONKA, ARE YOU
A LITTLE COMPLICATED?

920
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,891
ME?

921
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,184
NO!

922
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,186
AM I?

923
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,482
>> CAN WE VOTE?

924
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,483
>> CAN WE?

925
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,776
>> Jeff: HOLD ON.

926
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,237
KELLY B., FIRST BIG VOTE.

927
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,697
I'M GUESSING IT'S GOING
TO BE A GOOD THING

928
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,698
TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY.

929
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,615
WHAT'S THE CRITERIA?

930
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,576
>> UM, I'M KIND OF WONDERING
WHAT'S GOING

931
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,578
TO UNIFY OUR TRIBE THE MOST.

932
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,081
I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE NEED
IS UNITY AS A TRIBE

933
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,750
SO WE CAN GO BACK AND WIN
THE OTHER CHALLENGES,

934
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,128
AND I THINK THAT'S HOW PEOPLE
WILL VOTE TONIGHT.

935
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,549
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT
TO VOTE, WE'LL VOTE.

936
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,551
KELLY B., YOU'RE UP.

937
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,647
>> I GUESS THIS IS STILL
OUR GAME PLAN?

938
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,691
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

939
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,288
>> IT WAS EITHER ME OR HIM SO
THIS WAS AN EASY VOTE FOR ME.

940
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,476
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO HAVE MESSED

941
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,770
WITH THE BIGGEST BACHELOR
IN NEW YORK.

942
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,773
AS THEY SAY IN NICARAGUA,
HASTA LA VISTA.

943
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,537
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

944
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,344
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

945
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:31,345
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

946
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:33,389
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

947
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,684
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

948
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:41,856
FIRST VOTE, SHANNON.

949
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,985
BRENDA.

950
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:46,777
SHANNON.

951
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:51,031
TWO VOTES SHANNON,
ONE VOTE BRENDA.

952
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,366
BRENDA.

953
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:55,703
TIED AGAIN, TWO VOTES SHANNON,
TWO VOTES BRENDA.

954
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,746
SHANNON.

955
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,749
THREE VOTE SHANNON,
TWO VOTES BRENDA.

956
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,169
BRENDA.

957
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,923
WE'RE TIED, THREE VOTES SHANNON,
THREE VOTES BRENDA.

958
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,508
SHANNON.

959
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:14,263
THAT'S FOUR VOTES SHANNON,
THREE VOTES BRENDA.

960
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,306
SHANNON.

961
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:20,728
THAT'S FIVE VOTES SHANNON,
THREE VOTES BRENDA.

962
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,273
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA," SHANNON.

963
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,316
THAT'S SIX. THAT'S ENOUGH.

964
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,318
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

965
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,619
SHANNON, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

966
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,662
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

967
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,928
WELL, IT'S VERY CLEAR
FROM TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL

968
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:58,766
THAT THE BIGGEST THREAT TO
THIS TRIBE IS THE TRIBE ITSELF.

969
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,642
GRAB YOUR TORCHES,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

970
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,685
GOOD NIGHT.

971
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,199
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

972
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,496
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON "SURVIVOR"

973
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,956
LA FLOR FACES
A GAME-CHANGING DECISION.

974
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:22,831
NOW TO THE MEDALLION OF POWER.

975
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,750
YOUNGER TRIBE,
YOU GONNA USE IT OR NOT?

976
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:30,130
COACH JIMMY TRIES
TO RECRUIT NEW PLAYERS.

977
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,131
>> WHAT DID THEY SAY?

978
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,591
>> THEY SAY GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF HERE.

979
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,133
>> Jeff: AND NAONKA STRIKES.

980
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:33,717
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

981
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,928
>> WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

982
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,347
>> I'LL PUSH YOU SO HARD
THAT DAMN LEG WILL FLY OFF.

983
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,812
>> MY BIGGEST MISTAKE WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE TO BE--

984
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,188
I SHOULD HAVE GUNNED FOR CHASE.

985
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,982
LA FLOR JUST GOT A LOT WEAKER.

986
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:48,816
I MEAN, IT JUST LOST ITS LEG
AND BOTH ITS FEET.

987
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,277
THESE ARE A BUNCH OF KIDS.

988
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,153
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WITH THE OLDER TRIBE, ANYWAY.

989
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,447
I BEEN MARRIED FOR 11 YEARS.

990
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,825
YOU CAN STACK 11 YEARS ON ME
SO I'M 41 YEARS OLD.

991
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,826
I HOPE THE OLD PEOPLE WHIP UP
ON 'EM.

992
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,703
I HOPE THEY GET
WHAT THEY DESERVE.
