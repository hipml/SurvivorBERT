1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,335
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,002
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,587
AFTER THE MERGE, THE FORMER

4
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,923
SALANI MEMBERS SET OUT ON A

5
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:07,590
PLAN.

6
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,051
ME AND JANE, MIKE, WE HAVE

7
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,387
THIS PACT TO STICK WITH CHELSEA,

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,222
KIM, KAT, AND SABRINA.

9
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,223
Jeff: AT THE REWARD

10
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,934
CHALLENGE, A SCHOOLYARD PICK

11
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,270
SPLIT THE TRIBE INTO TWO TEAMS.

12
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,605
LEIF FLIES OFF THAT SLIDE!

13
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,273
KIM'S TEAM WAS VICTORIOUS.

14
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,192
YELLOW TRIBE ENJOYING YOUR

15
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:26,943
BARBECUE REWARD.

16
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,320
EARNING A REWARD AWAY FROM CAMP

17
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,614
WHILE TROYZAN AND JAY'S TEAM WAS

18
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,615
LEFT EMPTY HANDED.

19
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,117
WITH TROY AND JAY LEFT BEHIND,

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,785
KIM AND SABRINA SAW A CHANCE TO

21
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,453
MAKE A NEW PLAN.

22
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,080
IT HAS TO BE ALL GIRLS.

23
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,915
I SAY WE TELL TROY.

24
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,625
MIKE IS TRYING TO GET YOU OUT OF

25
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,334
HERE.

26
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,043
WE CAN START A REVOLUTION AND

27
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,629
GET RID OF MIKE AND APHI LATE

28
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,297
THEM.

29
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,506
Jeff: AFTER THE REWARD, KIM

30
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,633
WASTED LITTLE TIME PUTTING THE

31
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,301
PLAN INTO MOTION.

32
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,552
I WON'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY

33
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,803
MAKE THE MOVE.

34
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,304
Jeff: JAY BECAME

35
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:54,971
SUSPICIOUS.

36
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,974
I'M SCARED OF Y'ALL GIRLS.

37
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,517
Y'ALL GET RID OF HIM; Y'ALL GET

38
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,477
RID OF ME NEXT.

39
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,770
I DON'T TRUST THE GIRLS.

40
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,479
THERE'S TOO MANY GIRLS THAT

41
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,314
COULD HOOK UP AND START KNOCKING

42
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,648
OUT ALL THESE GUYS.

43
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,984
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

44
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,653
KIM'S BOLD MOVE PAID OFF.

45
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,780
EIGHTH PERSON PAID OFF AND THE

46
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,699
SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY, MIKE.

47
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,451
MIKE JOINED JONAS AS THE SECOND

48
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,327
MAN ON THE JOURNEY.

49
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,162
CAN THE MEN RECOVER FROM THEIR

50
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,122
NUMBERS DISADVANTAGE OR WILL THE

51
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,332
WOMEN TAKE OVER THE GAME?

52
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,041
TEN ARE LEFT.

53
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,919
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

54
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:55,907
NO WAY!

55
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:04,040
THAT'S CRAZY.

56
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,376
WE HAVE A FEW GUYS LEFT AND

57
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,502
THEY HAVE THE VOTE CHALLENGE.

58
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,087
THEY NEED TO SET THE GAME, WE'RE

59
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,546
GOING TO LOSE.

60
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,421
I DON'T MEAN...

61
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,215
LISTEN, I'M JUST PLAGUE OUT,

62
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,384
THOSE GIRLS ARE PLOTTING TO

63
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,343
KNOCK US ALL OUT ONE BY ONE AND

64
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,387
THEY'RE DOING IT AND IT'S

65
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,555
BECAUSE WE FELL APART.

66
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,681
NO, I KNOW.

67
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,932
BUT MIKE WAS NEVER WITH US

68
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,225
ANYWAY SO HE WAS BASICALLY LIKE

69
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:22,851
A GIRL VOTE.

70
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,019
(LAUGHS)

71
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,021
MIKE, I'M GLAD HE'S GONE.

72
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,398
HE WAS GUNNING FOR ME FROM DAY

73
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,233
ONE AND I SOT GOT SICK OF HIM.

74
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,026
FOR ME TO HAVE MIKE GONE, THAT'S

75
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,694
FINE.

76
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,361
BUT IT IS SIX GIRLS AND THEY

77
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,196
COULD VERY WELL SAY LISTEN,

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,905
LET'S GET RID OF TROY AND JAY

79
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,907
BECAUSE THEY'VE WON THE LAST TWO

80
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,075
IMMUNTIES AND THEY'RE STRONG

81
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,577
AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET VOTES

82
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,911
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

83
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,746
SO PART OF ME IS LIKE, GEEZ, ARE

84
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,706
THEY TELLING ME THE TRUTH?

85
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,208
IF KIM AND CHELSEA AND

86
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,460
SABRINA AND CATHY THEY'RE JUST

87
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,629
GOING TO, YOU KNOW, WALTZ ON

88
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,047
INTO, LIKE, THE FINALS,

89
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,757
SOMETHING MAJOR COULD HAPPEN IF

90
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,593
ANY ONE OF US FIND AN IDOL.

91
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,720
THERE'S A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

92
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,554
OUT THERE.

93
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,263
(LAUGHS)

94
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,432
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE OF OUR VOTES

95
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,309
TO GET RID OF A KIM OR A CHELSEA

96
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,103
OR A SABRINA OR A STRONG PLAYER

97
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,606
AND THEN IT'S BASICALLY... IT

98
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,608
COULD BE YOU, ME, JAY, CHRISTIE

99
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,276
THAT AND LEIF AND THAT'S FIVE.

100
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,277
IT WOULD BE FIVE AGAINST

101
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,986
FREAKING FOUR.

102
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,280
IT AIN'T GONNA WORK THAT WAY,

103
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:17,947
I DON'T THINK.

104
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,740
(LAUGHS)

105
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,617
I'M JUST SAYING, I'M JUST

106
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,242
SAYING.

107
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:21,951
I THINK YOU HAVE TO START

108
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,327
WINNING ALL THE IMMUNITY.

109
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,787
OKAY, FINE.

110
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,915
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT I HAVE

111
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,167
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL WHICH I'M

112
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,418
BANKING ON IF I SEE SOMETHING

113
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,420
FISHY GOING ON WITH KIM AND

114
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,129
CHELSEA.

115
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:33,755
I DON'T WANT TO BE BLINDSIDED

116
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,797
GOING OUT OF HERE.

117
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,465
SO IF THEY PULL THAT, THEY'RE

118
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,302
GOING TO GET THE FULL ON

119
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,429
SWITCHER-ROO.

120
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,955
TREEMAIL!

121
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,290
OH, MY GOSH!

122
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:09,999
ALL RIGHT.

123
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,001
IT SAYS "CARRY ALL OF THIS BACK

124
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,710
TO YOUR CAMP.

125
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,504
DO NOT OPEN THIS ENVELOPE UNTIL

126
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,465
ALL MEMBERS OF YOUR TRIBE ARE

127
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:17,715
TOGETHER."

128
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,341
WOW.

129
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,051
THE WHOLE TRIBE WENT TO

130
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,678
TREEMAIL AND WE SAW, LIKE, THIS

131
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,472
BIG POLE, WE SAW SOME, LIKE,

132
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,848
BALLS WITH STRING AND WE WERE,

133
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,517
LIKE, "OH, COOL, SO WE'RE GOING

134
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,227
TO HAVE A CHALLENGE HERE ON THE

135
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,520
ISLAND" WHICH IS GREAT WHICH

136
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,646
MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO GO

137
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,398
ANYWHERE, TRY TO WALK 50 MILES

138
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:33,815
SOMEWHERE.

139
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,524
ALL RIGHTY.

140
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,652
"TODAY YOU WILL COMPETE AN ALL

141
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,696
DO IT YOURSELF REWARD CHALLENGE.

142
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,405
YOU WILL DIVIDE YOURSELF INTO

143
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,365
TWO TEAMS."

144
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,867
IT WAS BASICALLY A GAME THAT

145
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,036
INVOLVED A NUMBERING SYSTEM OF

146
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,539
PEGS THAT WENT FROM ONE TO FIVE

147
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,416
POINTS AND THE WAY YOU ACHIEVE

148
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,876
POINTS WAS TO THROW A BOW US

149
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,671

150
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,588
NUMB SPWERS YOU WANT TO GET IT

151
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,423
AROUND ONE OF THE PEGS.

152
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,717
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

153
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,426
PLAYING FOR?

154
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,552
THE WINNING TRIBE WILL RECEIVE A

155
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,095
BOAT RIDE TO A SECLUDED ISLAND

156
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,639
WHERE THEY WILL BE TREATED TO A

157
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,724
LOCAL BARBECUE FEST.

158
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,891
OH, MY GOD!

159
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,600
I WANT TO EAT.

160
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,728
IT'S FOR THE WINNERS ONLY.

161
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,521
SHOULD WE DRAW FIRST?

162
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,522
WE CAN PRACTICE.

163
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,357
WE'RE DRAWING.

164
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,025
READY?

165
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,069
DON'T SHOW IT.

166
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,529
OH, YOU'RE FEELING AROUND.

167
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,366
OH, YEAH.

168
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:25,950
UH-HUH.

169
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:26,617
OH, I GUESS I'LL GO LAST.

170
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,413
ONE, TWO, THREE.

171
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,123
ALL RIGHT, I NEED THE REDS TO

172
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:32,540
COME OVER HERE.

173
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,084
BLACKS.

00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,258
TARZAN, KAT, AND MYSELF.

177
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,427
WE JUST NEED TO GET THOSE

178
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,094
POINTS.

179
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:45,762
AND THE OTHER TEAM WERE ALL

180
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,723
THE GIRLS AND LEIF LEFT OVER.

181
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:52,769
TROYZAN PROBST IS HOSTING THE

182
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,311
CHALLENGE.

183
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,437
SO HERE WE ARE, FOLKS.

184
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,563
WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM AND WE HAVE

185
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,647
AN OKAY TEAM.

186
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,315
(LAUGHTER)

187
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,818
I LOVE TROY LIKE COOKED FOOD

188
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,652
BUT HE IS NOBODY'S HOST AT ALL.

189
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,405
I THINK HE JUST NOMINATED

190
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:04,947
HIMSELF OR SOMEONE SAID IT AND

191
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,492
NO ONE ELSE OBJECTED.

192
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,994
JAY WANT THIS IS BARBECUE

193
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,746
MORE THAN HE CAN TASTE IT.

194
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,459
BIG JAY.

195
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,128
HE GETS THE FOUR AND GOES A

196
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,505
LITTLE LONG.

197
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,756
SORRY, JAY.

198
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,510
KIM IS UP NOW.

199
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,219
OH!

200
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,054
SHE HITS THE MIDDLE AND NOTHING.

201
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,181
SO IT'S 0-0 AFTER ROUND ONE.

202
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,643
KAT IS UP.

203
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,977
GOOD KAT!

204
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,853
GOOD JOB.

205
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,022
THEY TAKE THE LEAD 2-0.

206
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,315
READ TEAM LEADS.

207
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,484

208
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,527
OH!

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,863
OH, WIDE!

210
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,322
0.

211
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:46,864
TROYZAN IS UP.

212
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,657
I'LL HOLD YOUR STICK,

213
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,116
TROYZAN.

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:48,741
HOLD MY STICK.

215
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,493
TAKE YOUR TIME LIKE I DID.

216
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,705
ALL RIGHT.

217
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,540
OH!

218
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,334
ALL RIGHT CHELSEA.

219
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,964
COME ON, CHELSEA.

220
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,632
OH, HITS THE FOUR AND BOUNCES

221
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,174
OFF!

222
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:05,883
THE CROWD GOES WILD!

223
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,512
AND A RELIEF COMES OVER FOR THE

224
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,180
RED TEAM!

225
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:11,848
TARZAN!

226
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,891
TARZAN MAY BE THE BEST PLAYER

227
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,475
HERE.

228
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,726
TARZAN, THIS IS FOR YOUR

229
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,855
FIRST REWARD.

230
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:25,194
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

231
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,530
SO THAT'S 6-0.

232
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,700
CHRISTINA, LET'S SEE WHAT SHE'S

233
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,703
MADE OF.

234
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,370
1.

235
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:39,167
PUTS HER TEAM ON THE BOARD.

236
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,503
ALICIA'S SCORE COULD PULL IT

237
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,379
OUT.

238
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:43,796
OH!

239
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,381
0 FOR ALICIA.

240
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,175
SABRINA WITH THE LAST THROW.

241
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,926
I'M THE LAST PERSON TO GO IN

242
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,635
THE GAME.

243
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,678
THE HIGHEST YOU CAN SCORE ON THE

244
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,055
BOARD IS A 5 SO I HAVE TO GET A

245
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,515
FIVE IN ORDER TO TIE IT.

246
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,058
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO LET MY

247
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:56,851
TEAM DOWN.

248
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,728
I'M NOT DOUBTING MYSELF BUT JUST

249
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:04,233
LIKE LORD, REALLY?

250
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,235
NO!

251
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,571
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

252
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,908
BARBECUE!

253
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:18,080
TARZAN THE ALL STAR!

254
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,707
FINALLY!

255
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,333
YAY!

256
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,251
OKAY, SO THAT'S IT, FOLKS,

257
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,711
THANKS FOR COMING AND GET READY

258
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,754
FOR A BOAT RIDE.

259
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,922
PROTEIN!

260
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,007
BARBECUE!

261
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,855
OH, THIS IS AMAZING!

262
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,648
(APPLAUSE)

263
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,442
GOOD JOB, GUYS, GREAT JOB.

264
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:46,776
WHAT IS THAT?

265
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,444
RUM!

266
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,904
OH, IT'S RUM!

267
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,447
YEAH, I WANT RUM!

268
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,782
RUM AND COCOA, BABY.

269
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,741
I WANT A COCONUT.

270
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,285
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING

271
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:56,953
ABOUT.

272
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,329
I WAS, LIKE, YEAH, JUST GET

273
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,206
AWAY FROM THE GAME, GO TO SOME

274
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:00,957
ISLAND WITH THE GREATEST COCONUT

275
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,625
RUM DRINK I'VE EVER HAD IN
MY

276
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,334
LIFE.

277
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,294
THAT DOES TASTE GOOD, I CAN'T

278
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,130
BELIEVE IT.

279
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,299
SO WE WERE EXCITED.

280
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,136
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

281
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,973
YEAH, WE'RE DRUNK ON RUM!

282
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,766
TARZAN, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO

283
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,809
GO ON YOUR FIRST REWARD?

284
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,810
WONDERFUL.

285
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,811
ON OUR OWN ISLAND.

286
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,771
IT IS OUR OWN ISLAND.

287
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,315
LOOK AT THIS THING.

288
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,943
YEAH, BABY, WE'VE REACHED

289
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:29,610
PARADISE.

290
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,820
WE LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

291
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,989
SOUTH PACIFIC.

292
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,366
COCONUT RUM ALL AROUND.

293
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:35,825
CHEERS!

294
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,534
HEY, CAPTAIN.

295
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,785
IF WE COULD STAY HERE A NIGHT

296
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,829
I'D BE GOLDEN.

297
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,289
LET'S GET THE GIRLS ALL DRUNK.

298
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,665
YOU WANT ANOTHER COCONUT?

299
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,167
BRING ON THE RUM THERE, LAD.

300
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,627
CATCH YOUR COCONUT.

301
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,838
SKINNY DIPPING IN TEN

302
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,798
MINUTES, EVERYBODY!

303
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,466
I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT

304
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,092
SOMETHING.

305
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:53,884
IT LOOKS LIKE DECENT FISH.

306
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,804
I'M SALIVATING RIGHT NOW AS I'M

307
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,972
STANDING HERE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T

308
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,183
HAD ANY PROTEIN FOR 23 DAYS.

309
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,519
SOME BEAUTIFUL CRABS COLOR WISE

310
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,521
AND ARCHITECTURALLY.

311
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,189
NOW HE'S COOKING THE FISH.

312
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,858
A LOT OF FISH, HUH?

313
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,862
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT SUCKER!

314
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,655
(WHISTLES)

315
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,865
JAY, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING

316
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,365
RIGHT NOW?

317
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,033
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

318
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,868
WELL, I WAS MAD YESTERDAY...

319
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,496
I WASN'T REALLY MAD BUT I DIDN'T

320
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,416
REALLY WANT TO SEND MIKE HOME.

321
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,210
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CHRISTIE

322
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,380
THAT OR ALICIA BEFORE HIM.

323
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,007
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEND

324
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,717
ANOTHER DUDE HOME AND THEN,

325
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,385
LIKE, OH, WELL, OUR ALLIANCE,

326
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,721
OUR GIRLS FLIP ON US OR

327
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,221
SOMETHING.

328
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:39,889
WE'RE HESITANT.

329
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,224
ME AND KAT WERE TALKING AND I

330
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,684
WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE'S ON THE

331
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,393
SAME PAGE WITH ME BECAUSE AT

332
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,562
THIS POINT IT'S HARD TO TRUST

333
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:47,271
ANYBODY.

334
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,397
AND IF SOMEBODY HAS NUMBERS ON

335
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,732
YOU, IT'S DEFINITELY HARD TO

336
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,608
TRUST THEM.

337
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,818
YOU KNOW, ALICIA, CHRISTINA,

338
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,945
TARZAN AND LEIF ALL HAVE TO GO

339
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:55,279
BEFORE WE DO.

340
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,781
I KNOW.

341
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,699
WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER.

342
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,576
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT OUR ALLIANCE

343
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,370
SAID THEY WAS GOING TO DO.

344
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,371
LET'S DO IT.

345
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,455
LET'S SEND MANONO HOME AND STICK

346
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,081
WITH THE PLAN.

347
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,040
WHICH IS THE PLAN.

348
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,250
GUYS, FOOD'S READY.

349
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,919
I'M COMING!

350
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,254
I'M A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS THAT THE

351
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,756
GIRLS ARE PLAYING TRICKS WITH

352
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,340
US.

353
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,716
WOW, THAT IS SO GOOD!

354
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,300
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

355
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,719
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THE

356
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,387
CHICKEN.

357
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,262
THERE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO

358
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,722
BE BLIND SIDES COMING UP.

359
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,807
I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT ME.

360
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,784
DO YOU NOT?

361
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,828
MIKE WENT OUT AND THE GIRLS ARE

362
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,495
AHEAD.

363
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,913
I FEEL BAD BECAUSE, LIKE, I

364
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,415
THINK DEEP DOWN THEY KNOW THEY

365
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,666
MADE THE WRONG CHOICE ALREADY.

366
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,128
THEY HAVE TO BE REALLY WORRIED.

367
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,506
IT'S DEFINITELY A WIN-WIN TO

368
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,715
HAVE ANOTHER GUY GONE AND KNOW

369
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,300
THE WOMEN ARE IN THE MAJORITY

370
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:58,968
AND, YOU KNOW, MIKE'S GONE.

371
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,470
SO MY HOPE ALL ALONG HAS BEEN

372
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,596
EVERYBODY WILL THINK I'M JUST

373
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,181
KIND OF CALM AND SOFT SPOKEN AND

374
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,766
MAYBE A LITTLE FORGETTABLE AND

375
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,643
NOT CALLING THE SHOTS BUT I DO

376
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,310
THINK AT THE END OF THE GAME IF

377
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,187
I CAN SIT THERE WITH THE THREE I

378
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,439
THINK THE PEOPLE ON THE JURY

379
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,606
WILL KNOW THAT I WAS MAKING MOST

380
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,068
OF THESE DECISIONS.

381
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,903
I JUST THINK IT'S SMARTEST

382
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,655
FOR US TO GET RID OF JAY AND

383
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,490
TROY AND THEN GET RID OF TARZAN

384
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,074
AND LEIF.

385
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,451
OKAY, LET'S JUST SAY...

386
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,785
BUT WE NEED THEM TO BELIEVE

387
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,828
WITH ALL OF THEIR HEART THAT

388
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,621
THEY ARE NOT GOING HOME BECAUSE

389
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,289
IF THEY DON'T THEY WILL START...

390
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,624
THEY WILL FIND THAT IDOL OR

391
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,335
THEY'LL PULL SOME CRAP AND SO WE

392
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:33,627
JUST...

393
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,171
I AGREE.

394
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,672
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I WANT

395
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,840
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

396
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,136
DO YOU FEEL FUNKY ABOUT THAT?

397
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,514
I GOT A LOT GOING THROUGH MY

398
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,182
HEAD.

399
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,183
THE GIRLS HAD A DISCUSSION ON

400
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,059
THE BOAT THIS MORNING AND SAID

401
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,936
WHOEVER DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY

402
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,189
EITHER TROY OR JAY EITHER ONE OF

403
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,900
THEM HAS TO GO HOME NEXT.

404
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,277
WHICH IS KILLING ME RIGHT NOW.

405
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,321
BECAUSE I'VE LOOKED TROY AND JAY

406
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,325
IN THE EYES AND SAID "YOU CAN

407
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,034
TRUST ME 100%."

408
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,745
AND LOOKING THEM IN THE EYES AND

409
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,496
TELLING THEM THEY CAN TRUST ME

410
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,873
AND THEN BETRAYING THEM, THAT'S

411
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,168
JUST NOT... THAT'S NOT ME AT

412
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,712
ALL.

413
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,506
DO YOU NOT THINK IT'S A GOOD

414
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,548
IDEA TO GET RID OF THEM?

415
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,091
I DON'T KNOW, I'VE GOT TO

416
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:21,759
THINK.

417
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,927
JAY COULD WIN EVERY IMMUNITY

418
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,720
FROM HERE ON IN.

419
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,179
AND TROY HAS A GOOD SHOT AT

420
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:25,888
DOING THAT, TOO.

421
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,224
SO THE MINUTE THEY DON'T WIN I

422
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:28,933
THINK THEY HAVE TO GO.

423
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,559
THIS IS LIKE THE PART OF THIS

424
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,894
GAME THAT SUCKS SO BAD.

425
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,604
IT SUCKS ASS.

426
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,813
THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU

427
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,940
NEED TO TAKE YOUR HEART OUT OF

428
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,358
THE GAME AND PUT YOUR BRAIN BACK

429
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,944
IN THE GAME.

430
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:40,528
SERIOUSLY.

431
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,238
LIKE, CHELSEA GOT ALL

432
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:42,947
SENSITIVE.

433
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,241
YOU KNOW, THAT REALLY PISSED ME

434
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:45,991
OFF.

435
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,368
NO ONE TOLD YOU TO MIX WITH THE

436
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,369
BOYS ANYWAYS.

437
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,537
LIKE, WE WERE FINE WITHOUT THEM

438
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,246
AND THEN YOU GO OFF AND PROMISE

439
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,706
THEM THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CARRY

440
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,084
THEM TO THE TOP.

441
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,711
PLEASE.

442
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,296
SHE CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT

443
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,756
THAT WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE JAY

444
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,465
AND TROY.

445
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,925
WHAT SHE SAID WAS "I JUST DON'T

446
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,093
WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.

447
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,762
I JUST DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT

448
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:07,471
IT."

449
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,055
I WAS LIKE, DUDE, WHAT IS WRONG

450
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:08,764
WITH YOU?

451
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,431
WE COULD BE FINAL THREE OR FOUR.

452
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,935
SO NEXT TO GO HAS TO BE A BIG

453
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,269
MOVE.

454
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:13,936
EXACTLY.

455
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,438
WE CAN'T HAVE A LEAK OR CRACK

456
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,064
IN THE ALLIANCE.

457
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:17,731
EXACTLY.

458
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,190
AT ALL.

459
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:18,899
EXACTLY.

460
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,818
I MEAN, WE CAN SO GO OUT WITH

461
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,443
A BANG WITH ALL GIRLS.

462
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,112
WE CAN NOT HAVE ALL GUYS.

463
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,321
I KNOW, AND WE WILL HAVE

464
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,950
THREE AT... THE FINAL THREE?

465
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,659
DUDE.

466
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,786
LET'S TAKE IT WAY BACK TO DAY

467
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,328
ONE.

468
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:31,996
WE FORMED THIS ALLIANCE.

469
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,955
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

470
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,581
STICK WITH.

471
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,290
WE WANT TO GO TO THE END.

472
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,166
GOING TO THE END REQUIRES SOME

473
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,835
BIG-GIRL DECISIONS.

474
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,837
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT ON YOUR

475
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,463
BIG-GIRL PANTIES AND MAKE A

476
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,172
BIG-GIRL DECISION.

477
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,173
YOU KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO

478
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:53,142
COME TO THIS.

479
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,478
YOU VOTING MIKE OUT, I

480
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,187
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT.

481
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:57,980
BUT THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS FOR US

482
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,690
TO STICK TOGETHER.

483
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,817
IF WE STRAY FROM THAT, THEN IF

484
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,485
WE GET MIXED UP OR LET PEOPLE IN

485
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,153
AND SCREW US UP, WHO KNOWS WHAT

486
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:04,862
WILL HAPPEN.

487
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,156
THAT DON'T GUARANTEE US CRAP.

488
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,824
THEY NEED TO PICK OFF A FEW

489
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,994
GIRLS TO LET US KNOW THEY'RE ON

490
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:12,703
BOARD.

491
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,371
CHRISTINA AND LISA HAVE TO GO AT

492
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,956
SOME POINT SOON.

493
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,666
NEXT ON BOARD IS ALICIA.

494
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,292
OKAY.

495
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,501
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

496
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,669
ALICIA NEEDS TO GO BEFORE

497
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,920
CHRISTIE THAT.

498
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,297
ALICIA'S MORE KIND OF TWO-SIDED

499
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,048
WORKING WITH THE GUYS AND GIRL

500
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,051
SO TO ME SHE'S MORE OF A THREAT.

501
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,302
SHE'S REAL TIGHT WITH KAT.

502
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,678
I DON'T TRUST THAT.

503
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,429
THINK ABOUT IT.

504
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,263
IF WE STICK TOGETHER ME AND YOU

505
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,139
IN THE FINAL FOUR.

506
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,016
YEAH.

507
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,353
DUDE, THAT'S JUST... AND WE HAVE

508
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,395
A GREAT CHANCE, TOO.

509
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,189
WE CAN WIN EVERY FREAKING

510
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,857
IMMUNITY.

511
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,441
SERIOUSLY.

512
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,693
ME AND TROY ARE GOOD.

513
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,028
WE'RE STILL THINKING ME AND HIM

514
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,196
ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER FOR A

515
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,113
REAL LONG TIME.

516
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,281
HE THINKS I'M COMFORTABLE

517
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,908
SITTING IN THE END WITH HIM.

518
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,076
I'M GOING TO LET HIM KEEP

519
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:52,785
THINKING THAT.

520
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,535
BUT HE'S DANGEROUS AND YOU DON'T

521
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,537
WANT TO SIT IN THE END WITH HIM

522
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,914
BECAUSE EVERYBODY LIKES HIM, HE

523
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,540
SEEMS LIKE HE CAN TELL A STORY

524
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,208
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

525
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,876
BUT KIM AND CHELSEA, THOSE ARE

526
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,586
MY FINAL TWO GIRLS I'M TRYING TO

527
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,253
WORK WITH.

528
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,213
SO YOU HAVE TO TRUST THEM A

529
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,547
LITTLE BIT BUT AT THE SAME TIME

530
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,132
YOU GET... YOU'VE STILL GOT TO

531
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,009
KEEP THEM AS CLOSE AS THE ENEMY

532
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,886
AROUND HERE.

533
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,429
YOU KNOW, THE LAST TWO HAVE BEEN

534
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,056
JONAS AND MIKE AND THE PLAN IS

535
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,724
TO GET RID OF THE REST OF

536
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,351
MANONO, SO THAT PUTS CHRISTIE

537
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,852
THAT AND ALICIA ON THE BLOCK.

538
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,395
OKAY.

539
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,229
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT

540
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,898
WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH ALICIA.

541
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:23,607
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THE REST OF

542
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,403
OUR ALLIANCE, BUT I CHITCHATTED

543
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,028
WITH TROY.

544
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,322
AND SHE'S WEAKER THAN WHO?

545
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,074
SHE'S A THREAT.

546
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,867
SHE'S A MANONO.

547
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,953
SHE WORKS BOTH SIDES.

548
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,747
IT NEEDS TO BE HER TOMORROW.

549
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,749
I HAD TO SACRIFICE.

550
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,252
TROY HAD TO SACRIFICE.

551
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,130
WE NEED YOU TO MOVE FORWARD.

552
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,257
ARE YOU DOWN WITH THAT?

553
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:54,638
WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY, NO?

554
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,766
DROP IT.

555
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,309
ALL RIGHT, WELL LET ME GET

556
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:04,189
CONFIRMATION FROM EVERYBODY.

557
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,941
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE JAY AND I

558
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:07,651
REALLY DO LIKE HIM A LOT BUT I

559
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,360
CAN'T THINK WITH MY HEART AND

560
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,114
NEITHER CAN CHELSEA, NEITHER CAN

561
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:12,823
SABRINA AND KIM.

562
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,949
WE HAVE TO THINK WITH OUR MIND.

563
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:14,783
STRATEGICALLY THAT'S HOW PEOPLE
WIN WITH THIS GAME.

564
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,285
SO LET'S GET IT STRAIGHT.

565
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,286
I JUST TOLD KAT THAT I WAS ON

566
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,830

OKAY.

570
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,130
SHE JUST WANTED CONFIRMATION.

571
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,965
YOU ALL RIGHT?

572
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,300
YEAH, I'M FINE.

573
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,301
IS THAT COOL?

574
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:32,968
YES.

575
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,970
SO WE CAN MAKE THAT SET AND

576
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,346
NOT DERIVE FROM IT.

577
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,308

578
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,311

ALL RIGHT.

581
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,983
IT JUST SUCKS.

582
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,734
I REALLY MADE SOME CLOSE

583
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,487
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE GUYS AND

584
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,863
JAY'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT'S

585
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,448
VERY HARD TO LOOK HIM IN THE EYE

586
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,783
AND LIE TO HIM.

587
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,159
FORTUNATELY THERE'S, LIKE, FOUR

588
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,327
GIRLS STANDING THERE AND I

589
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,495
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT

590
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,288
HIM IN HIS EYE AND SAY "I

591
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,915
PROMISE THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO

592
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,540
HAPPEN."

593
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:08,462
BUT I JUST HATE TO BE THAT

594
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:08,879
DECEITFUL.

595
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:09,588
I DON'T KNOW.

596
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,297
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS.

597
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,365
OH, I KNOW.

598
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,659
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT TROY OR

599
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,245
JAY AND, LIKE, TELL THE GUYS

600
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:41,954
IT'S YOU.

601
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,331
I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE ONLY

602
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,874
WAY SO DON'T WORRY.

603
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,877
WE'RE SO SOLID.

604
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,045
WE'RE JUST PLAYING IT ALL THE

00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,130
WAY HOME AND WHOEVER DOESN'T WIN

606
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,382
IMMUNITY, TROY OR JAY, IS GOING

607
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:53,924
HOME.

608
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,842
SO JUST DON'T FREAK OUT.

609
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,300
OKAY.

610
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,094
JUST BE YOURSELF.

611
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,221
JAY TOLD US ALL THAT HE

612
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,389
THOUGHT ALICIA SHOULD GO HOME

613
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,224
TONIGHT AND WE ALL JUST NODDED

614
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,892
AND AGREED AND SAID YES BUT

615
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,228
THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT HAPPENING.

616
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,688
JUST STAY CALM AND YOU'RE SO

617
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:07,980
SET.

618
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:08,814
OKAY.

619
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,899
I'M READY TO DRAW THE LINE.

620
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,401
LIKE, IT'S BEEN MUDDY FOR LONG

621
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,069
ENOUGH AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME

622
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,196
FOR THE GUYS TO KNOW WHERE THE

623
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,074
WOMEN STAND.

624
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:19,867
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

625
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,702
ALL RIGHT.

626
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,079
KIM AND ALICIA WERE ON THE

627
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,372

628
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,707

632
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,796
AND THEY GOT SIX OF THEM, IT

633
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,964

635
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,427
IT WOULDN'T BE THAT HARD.

EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE.

652
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,077
WE'RE WRITING DOWN ALICIA.

653
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,246
GOD, I JUST WANT THEM TO TRY

TROY'S JUST CONCERNED THAT THE

661
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,631
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO BLIND

662
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,298

663
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,967
BUT WE HAD A LITTLE POWWOW,

664
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:19,509

00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,628
TO VOTE YOU OUT.

753
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,797
Jeff: COOKIES WERE GOOD.

754
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,964
CUPCAKES ARE ALWAYS BETTER.

755
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:03,965
WOW!

756
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:04,591

757
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,759
I'LL STEP DOWN.

758
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,178
I'M STEPPING DOWN.

759
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,971
Jeff: IT'S KIM AND KAT.

760
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,433
KIM AND KAT MUST FEEL VERY SAFE.

761
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,352
CHELSEA, I'LL JUMP OFF ON THE

762
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,312
NEXT FOOD ONE AND JAY WILL COME

763
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:17,979
OFF.

764
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:18,480
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS OUTLAST

765
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,272
THE OTHER GUYS.

766
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,649
I THINK THAT'S B. S +áFPL.

767
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,442
I CAN LAST LONG, BUT I'M

768
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,985

769
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,820

00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,696
Jeff: WAIT, LET ME MAKE

772
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,823
SURE I GOT THIS RIGHT.

773
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,157
YOU COULD LAST LONG BUT YOU'RE

774
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,451
GOING TO CHOOSE NOT TO SO THAT

775
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,119
CHELSEA CAN.

776
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,328
IF SHE WANTS TO WIN THIS ONE

777
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:33,954
REALLY BAD I'LL LET HER WIN IT.

778
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,623
YOU'LL LET ME OR YOU JUST

00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,625
WANT SOME DAMN FOOD!

780
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,711
(LAUGHS)

781
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,463
Jeff: GONNA AMP UP THE

782
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,548
SWEET FACTOR A LITTLE MORE.

783
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,882
I WANT IT!

784
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,634
Jeff: ALICIA, YOU WANT IT

SIGHT UNSEEN?

786
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,511
I WANT IT.

787
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,014
Jeff: STEP OFF THAT

788
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:53,682
CHALLENGE.

789
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,349
ALICIA'S OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

790
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,184
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT

791
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:56,726
IS, GIRL!

792
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,561
Jeff: REMEMBER, CHELSEA,

793
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,521
SHE DID THIS AS A FAVOR TO YOU.

794
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,857
Jeff: ALICIA, YOU GAVE UP

795
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,691
IMMUNITY.

796
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,358
HERE'S WHAT YOU GAVE IT UP FOR.
OH, MAN!

797
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,985
Jeff: A BOWL FULL OF CANDY

798
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:05,819
AND CHOCOLATE.

799
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,696
I'M GOOD!

800
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,865
Jeff: TIME TO FIND OUT WHO

801
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,366
REALLY WANTS TO FIGHT FOR

802
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,701
IMMUNITY AND WHO'S WAITING FOR

803
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,702
SOMETHING REALLY HUGE TO STEP

804
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:26,214
DOWN.

805
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,341
Jeff: FOUR PEOPLE LEFT IN

806
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,093

807
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,469
IMMUNITY WHILE SIX PEOPLE OVER

808
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,014
HERE ARE SURE THEY DON'T NEED

809
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:34,598
IT.

810
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,057
"I DON'T NEED IMMUNITY.

811
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,893
I'M GOOD TO GO!"

812
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,603
LEIF TRYING TO KEEP THE BLOOD

813
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,103

814
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,606
PUMPING THAT FIST.

TROYZAN WITH A NEAR FATAL

817
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,665
MISTAKE.

818
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,626
OH, TROYZAN LOSES HIS BALANCE.

819
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,585
YES!

820
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,754
Jeff: TROYZAN IS OUT OF THE

821
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,713
CHALLENGE.

822
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,257
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY TONIGHT.

823
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:15,430
WE ARE NOW DOWN TO THREE.

824
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,099
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE AND A

825
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,100
GUARANTEED 1-9 SHOT AT WINNING

826
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:19,726
THIS GAME.

827
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,936
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT UP FOR

828
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,521
CHICKEN WINGS AND STPWHAOER.

829
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,607
OH, MY GOD!

830
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,108
Jeff: JAY IS OUT OF THE

831
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,401
CHALLENGE AND WE ARE DOWN TO

832
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:28,985
TWO.

833
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,445
HE DON'T EVEN DRINK BEER!

834
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:30,946
(LAUGHS)

835
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,905
WOW.

836
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,989
GOOD JOB, JAY.

837
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,033
OOH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

838
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:35,784
IS IT BETTER THAN THE CHICKEN

839
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:40,455
I CAUGHT?

840
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,831
LEIF ONCE AGAIN IN IT AT THE

841
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,499
END.

842
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,377
HE'S BEEN BATTLING FOR THESE

843
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,795
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGES, HAS YET

844
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,754
TO WIN ONE.

845
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:48,797
CHELSEA SAID ALL ALONG "I'M NOT

846
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,840
STEPPING DOWN, I WANT TO WIN."

847
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,759
I'M STILL EMBARRASSED ABOUT

848
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,010
THAT PUZZLE SO I'M GOING TO BE

849
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,303

850
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:55,929
ALL RIGHT.

851
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:56,972
I'VE GOT TO PROVE MYSELF.

852
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,640
I'VE GOT TO PROVE MYSELF,

853
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,349
TOO.

854
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,642
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THIS, IF

855
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,310
YOU STEP DOWN IT MAKES YOU LESS

856
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:02,978
OF A THREAT.

857
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,605
Jeff: WOW, IT NEVER STOPS,

858
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,273
LEIF.

859
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,649
YOU CURIOUS ABOUT WHY SHE'S

860
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,149

861
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,109
YEAH.

862
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,652
Jeff: CHELSEA'S SAYING

863
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,945
WINNING THIS ACTUALLY WORKS

864
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,405
AGAINST YOU.

865
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,158
WHO DO YOU TRUST?

866
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,327
I COULD STAY UP HERE ALL DAY

867
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,999
LONG.

868
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,459
Jeff: NEXT ITEM TO TRY TO

869
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,838

EATEN.

873
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,012
I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.

874
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,473
.Jeff: YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE

875
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:40,765
IT?

876
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,349
NOPE.

877
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,350
Jeff: CHELSEA NOT EVEN

878
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,518
TEMPTING HERSELF BY LOOKING.

879
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,686
LEIF, SHE'S TELLING YOU STEP

880
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,229

00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,355
BURGER AND MAKE YOURSELF LESS OF

00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,064
A THREAT.

883
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,858
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT DEAL IF YOU

884
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,859
BUY IT.

885
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,027
CHELSEA?

886
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,694
IS THAT TRUE?

887
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,195
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

888
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,864
.IS THAT TRUE?

889
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,158
LOOK AT ME IN THE EYES, IT'S

890
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:58,575
TRUE.

891
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,034

893
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,041
Jeff: LEIF STEPS OUT.

902
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,933
Jeff: CHELSEA, COME ON OVER

903
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,642

919
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,977
ONE OF THE BEST CHALLENGES EVER.

920
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,562
TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

921
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,106
COULD NOT HAVE GONE BETTER FOR

922
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:11,564
ME.

923
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,273
IT WAS AWESOME.

924
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,735
I GOT TO EAT CUPCAKES AND HAVE

925
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,778
MILK AND NOT PUT MYSELF OUT

926
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,946
THERE AS A HUGE THREAT WHICH I

927
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,448
WAS KIND OF STARTING TO FEEL A

928
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,449
LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT.

929
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,617
I'M GLAD FOR CHELSEA TO TAKE

930
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,284
THAT ROLE TODAY.

931
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,162
YOU WERE, LIKE, I SAID, OH,

00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:26,830

00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,872
I WAS STILL WANTING TO GO A

934
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,457
LITTLE FURTHER WITH JAY AND TROY

935
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,125
BUT I'M REALIZING NOW THAT THAT

936
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,462
WOULD BE AN IDIOT MOVE SO TO

937
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,464
TURN THIS QUICK ON THEM I HATE

938
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,468
TO BE THAT PERSON BUT I LOVE

939
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,011
MONEY SO... (LAUGHS)

940
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:42,804
I WAS PISSED OFF WHEN I FELL

941
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,304
OFF.

942
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:43,972
YEAH, YOU WERE.

943
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,307
TOOK MY THING AND THREW IT.

944
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,642
I JUST WANT TO COMPETE.

945
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,644
TROY RIGHT NOW IS OUR BIGGEST

946
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,020
THREAT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO WIN

947
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,647
THIS GAME SO BAD.

948
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,314
I THINK MORE THAN ANYONE HERE.

949
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,650
I HAD IN THE MY MIND LIKE I'M

950
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,485
GOING ON THE THIRD ONE.

951
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,027
JAY, ON THE OTHER HAND, GAVE

952
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,779
UP FOR FOOD.

953
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,488
HE THINKS HE'S SAFE.

954
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,032
TROY DIDN'T GIVE UP FOR FOOD SO

955
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:03,992
I THINK RIGHT NOW HE'S THE

956
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:09,998
SMARTEST PERSON TO TAKE OUT.

957
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,918
I THINK WE POTENTIALLY HAVE

958
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,129
EIGHT VOTES FOR TROY SO WE'RE

959
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,548
GOING TO THROW THREE VOTES AT

960
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,008
JAY JUST...?

961
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,800
IN CASE?

962
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,303
I HATE IT BUT, LIKE... I

963
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:23,970
THINK JUST IN CASE.

964
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,763
BECAUSE IF TROY PLAYS AN

965
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,431
IDOL.

966
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,015
THE SPLIT VOTE PLAN, ALWAYS

967
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,018
RISKY, MAKES ME NERVOUS.

968
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,853
I'D RATHER KNOW EVERYONE'S

969
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,062
VOTING FOR TROY BUT THERE'S A

970
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,648
CHANCE TROY WILL THROW OUT AN

971
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,316
IMMUNITY IDOL.

972
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,193
HE'S A STRATEGIC PLAYER AND

973
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,652
THINKING A LOT AND HE'S GOING TO

974
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,361
DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO STAY IN

975
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,363
THIS GAME AND HE STILL HAS SOME

976
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:42,989
OPTIONS TODAY.

977
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,032
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE LIKE

978
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,493
CHRISTINA AND TARZAN AND LEIF

979
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,077
ARE JUST HANGING ON RIDING THIS

980
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,372
THING OUT SO CHRISTINA, ALICIA,

981
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,040

982
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,334
MYSELF, CHELSEA, SABRINA AND CAT

983
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,210
WILL VOTE FOR TROY.

984
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,336
HERE HE COMES.

985
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,837
JAY DOES?

986
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:02,675
YEAH.

987
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,885
PLEASE TELL ME I DON'T HAVE

988
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,762
TO WORRY ABOUT NO CRAZINESS.

989
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,722
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

990
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,348
NO CRAZINESS.

991
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:08,890
NO BLONDNESS GOING ON.

992
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,474
HUH?

993
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,893
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ANY

994
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,519
BLOND STRATEGY GOING ON.

995
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,562
NOTHING CRAZY, EVERYBODY'S

996
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:14,896
GOOD.

997
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,271
OKAY.

998
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,316
COOL BEANS.

999
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,275
IT'S TROY.

1000
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,236
BUT WE WANT TO SPLIT THE VOTE

1001
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,570
JUST TO DOUBLE CHECK AND MAKE

1002
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,031
SURE IN CASE HE PLAYS AN IDOL SO

1003
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,242
WHY DON'T YOU AND TARZAN VOTE

1004
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:27,909
FOR TROY.

1005
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:32,080
I'LL TELL CHRISTIE THAT IT'S

1006
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,539
TROY.

1007
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,081

CHELSEA, KAT, SABRINA, MYSELF

1010
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,169
AND TROY.

1011
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,463
AND IF THEY PLAY AN IDOL

1012
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,214
NOBODY GOES HOME.

1013
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,924
IT WILL BE JAY INSTEAD OF TROY.

1014
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,508
OKAY.

1015
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,760
YOU'RE NOT VOTING ME OFF.

1016
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:46,469
NO.

1017
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,845
YOU KNOW, IF I WAS PLAYING

1018
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,889
THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE AND I'D SAY

1019
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,599
IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH FOR THE

1020
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,934
GIRLS JUST TO SAY..

1021
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,768
RIGHT.

1022
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,395
...LET'S TAKE TROY AND YAY.

1023
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,938
I GET WHY Y'ALL FEEL...

1024
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,981
TO ME IT STILL FEELS...

1025
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,775
I FEEL THAT WAY WITH TARZAN,

1026
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,235
LEIF, KAT AND ALICIA.

1027
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,737
I DON'T TRUST TWO OF THOSE GIRLS

1028
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,154
SO.

1029
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:05,780
ANYWAY...

1030
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,740
SO IT'S DEFINITELY ALICIA?

1031
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,449
YOU SWEAR TO ME?

1032
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,243
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BLIND SIDE

1033
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:10,493
ME?

1034
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,619
NO!

1035
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,788
LIKE THAT MY "SURVIVOR"

1036
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,164
EXPERIENCE SUCKS!

1037
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:15,623
WE'RE GOOD.

1038
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,833
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1039
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,752
KIM KEPT GOING LIKE "DON'T

1040
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,295
WORRY."

1041
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:20,962
ALMOST LIKE TOO MUCH.

1042
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,297
I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS FISHY.

1043
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,465
LIKE, IF SHE WANTED TO GET ME

1044
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,133
OUT, SHE'D WANT TO BE EXTRA SURE

1045
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,678
THAT I FELT LIKE I WAS SAFE.

1046
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,472
IT SOUNDED LIKE THAT A LITTLE

1047
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,140
BIT.

1048
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,808
THIS MAY GO INTO PLAY SOON.

1049
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,184
IT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.

1050
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,228
LIKE "YOU'RE SAFE, YOU'RE SAFE."

1051
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,730
YOU ONLY HAVE TO SAY IT ONCE.

1052
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,356
I THINK KIM AND CHELSEA ARE

1053
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,649
PULLING ONE OVER ON US.

1054
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,527
I HAVE AN IDOL, BRO, I'M PLAYING

1055
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,236
IT.

1056
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,820
IF THEY'RE PLAYING ME, I WANT

1057
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,113
THE PERSON TO GO HOME.

1058
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,156
I DON'T THINK NOBODY'S

1059
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,824
PLAYING YOU, TROY.

1060
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:52,493
I'VE GOT A FEELING THEY'RE

1061
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,161
PLAYING ME.

1062
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,163
I AIN'T HEARD THE SLIGHTEST

1063
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:55,747
INKREUPB NATION.

1064
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,165
THEY WOULDN'T TELL YOU

1065
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:57,874
ANYWAY.

1066
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,708
YOU'RE BASICALLY HOOKED TO ME.

1067
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,710
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT, MAN.

1068
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,212
BUT I DON'T... ITY YOU'RE GOOD.

1069
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,006
WOULD YOU VOTE FOR KIM?

1070
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,133
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO JUST SAY

1071
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,843
ALICIA BECAUSE I REALLY THINK

1072
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:09,552
IT'S HER.

1073
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,262
IF I GET TARZAN TO VOTE FOR

1074
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,180

1075
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:12,805
KIM?

1076
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,849
I THINK YOU'RE SAFE, BRO.

1077
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:15,350
OKAY.

1078
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,018
I THINK YOU'RE SAFE.

THAT'S NEWS TO ME TROY HAS AN

1080
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,104

00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,524

I'M NOT VOTING KIM OUT BECAUSE

1086
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,196
THAT'S MY FINAL THREE.

1087
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,699
TELL CHRISTINA TO COME TALK TO

1088
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,367
ME.

1089
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:32,909
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HIT

1090
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,534
THE FAN.

1091
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,077
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE

1092
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,535
TONIGHT.

1093
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,914
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1094
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,957
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE

NOPE.

1099
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,924
BUT HE'S DEBATING ON PLAYING AN

1100
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:48,341

1124
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,874
SO HOPEFULLY WE HAVE ENOUGH

1125
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,209
PEOPLE ON BOARD THAT DO ENOUGH

1126
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,252
OF THE RIGHT THING THAT THE

1127
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,421
RIGHT PERSON WILL GO HOME

1128
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:36,514
TONIGHT.

1129
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:42,979
TONIGHT.

1130
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:43,563
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1131
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:47,275
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1132
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,986
JONAS AND MICHAEL VOTED OUT AT

1133
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:58,578
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1134
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,413
TROYZAN, IN THE LAST TWO TRIBAL

1135
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,081
COUNCILS, TWO GUYS HAVE GONE

1136
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,249
HOME, JONAS AND MICHAEL.

1137
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,418
IS THAT A SIGN THAT MAYBE THIS

1138
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,545
IS STILL A MEN VERSUS WOMEN

1139
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,212
GAME?

1140
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,297
I THOUGHT IT WAS COINCIDENCE

1141
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,632
BUT AS DAYS GO ON, THE MORE I'M

1142
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,011
THINKING IT'S STILL A LITTLE BIT

1143
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:15,636
MEN/WOMEN.

1144
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,013
Jeff: TARZAN, HOW DID THE

1145
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,140
MEN LOSE CONTROL IF THIS IS,

1146
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,267
INDEED, MEN VERSUS WOMEN?

1147
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,144
WELL, THEY LOST THEIR WILL

1148
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,773
SEVERAL DAYS AND THE ALLEGIANCE

1149
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,025
WAS BROKEN AND NOW IT'S WOMEN

1150
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:29,734
TWO-UP.

1151
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,526
SO THE GIRLS ARE A LOT SMARTER

1152
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,695
THAN THE BOYS.

1153
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,321
Jeff: JAY, IS IT POSSIBLE

1154
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,448
THAT IT'S JUST THE WAY THE

1155
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,324
NUMBERS FELL THAT IT'S TWO GUYS?

1156
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,035
I'M KIND OF WITH TROY ON

1157
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:39,660
THIS.

1158
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,704
MY HOPE OF GUYS AND GIRLS

1159
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,039
MESHING AND JOINING A LITTLE

1160
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,041
BIT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF

1161
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,667
SCRAMBLING GOING ON TODAY AND I

1162
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,211
DON'T FEEL AS SAFE AS I DID LAST

1163
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,337
TIME SITTING HERE TONIGHT.

1164
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,881
Jeff: ACTUALLY, LET ME ASK

1165
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,548
EVERYONE ELSE HERE.

1166
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,758
WHO HERE TONIGHT THINKS THEY

1167
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,344
MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE?

1168
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,305
KIM, JAY, TROYZAN.

1169
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,849
NOBODY ELSE?

1170
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,184
KIM, DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU,

1171
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,519
WITH ALL THE SCRAMBLING JAY

1172
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,853
TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE'S STILL

1173
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,229
ONLY THREE PEOPLE THAT ARE

1174
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:06,771
WORRIED?

1175
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,481
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

1176
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,357
I FELT SAFE AT THE IMMUNITY

1177
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,692
CHALLENGE, I FELT SAFE WHILE I

1178
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,736
ATE AND AFTERWARDS JUST TODAY

1179
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,197
THIS AFTERNOON AT CAMP THERE WAS

1180
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,198
A FUNKY VIBE.

1181
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,659
I THINK YOU UNDERESTIMATE HOW

1182
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,743
PARANOID PEOPLE GET, THEY RUN

1183
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,369
AROUND AND OTHER PEOPLE GET

1184
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,119
PARANOID.

1185
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,246
SO I STARTED FEELING A LOT LESS

1186
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,665
SAFE AFTER THE IMMUNITY

1187
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,207
CHALLENGE TODAY.

1188
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,544
Jeff: CHELSEA, PARANOIA.

1189
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,879
PARANOIA CAN REALLY WREAK HAVOC

1190
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,588
ON A PLAN.

1191
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,550
WHAT DO YOU DO IN THIS GAME TO

1192
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,385
KEEP YOUR PLAN INTACT?

1193
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,013
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A... AS

1194
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,266
MUCH AS THIS GAME... YOU KNOW,

1195
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,017
WE'VE ALL WATCHED IT AND WE KNOW

1196
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:45,726
THAT PEOPLE ARE DISHONEST BUT

1197
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,603
THERE COMES A POINT WHERE YOU

1198
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,689
REALLY HAVE TO GO WITH YOUR GUT

1199
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,399
AND JUST REALLY HOPE THAT PEOPLE

1200
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,401
ARE BEING HONEST WITH YOU AND

1201
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,902
JUST LOOK THEM IN THE EYES AND

1202
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,279
JUST TELL THEM HOW YOU FEEL AND

1203
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,738
HOPE THAT THEY'RE BEING HONEST

1204
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,449
WHEN THEY RESPOND.

1205
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,450
AND THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.

1206
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,370
Jeff: TROYZAN, HOW MIXED UP

1207
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,788
IS THIS GAME RIGHT NOW?

1208
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,374
IN MY MIND IT'S MIXED UP LIKE

1209
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,000
HELL.

1210
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,418
Jeff: DID IT MIX UP BEFORE

1211
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,128
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE OR AFTER?

1212
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,588
AFTER.

1213
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,797
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN

1214
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,592
KIND OF START TO TELL LIKE WHO

1215
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,426
DECIDES TO STEP OUT FIRST AND

1216
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,304
GET FOOD, WHO APPLAUDS WHO WHEN

1217
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,722
SOMEONE GOES OUT.

1218
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,473
YOU KNOW, I NOTICED THAT WHEN I

1219
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,559
WENT OUT EVERYBODY APPLAUDED

1220
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,310
EVEN SOME OF THE TRIBE THAT I

1221
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,770
THOUGHT WOULD BE ROOTING FOR ME

1222
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,689
I THINK MIGHT BE ROOTING AGAINST

1223
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,273
ME.

1224
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,859
SO THAT MEANT SOMETHING.

1225
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,736
Jeff: CHELSEA, WHAT'S THE

1226
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,863
TALK ABOUT HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1227
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:39,572
IDOLS.

1228
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,907
THE TALK IS THAT WE'RE AT DAY

1229
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,409
25 AND NO ONE'S YET TO PULL ONE

1230
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:43,993
OUT.

1231
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,535
Jeff: IS THERE TALK ABOUT

1232
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:44,827
WHO MIGHT HAVE ONE?

1233
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,746
YEAH.

1234
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,331
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT ACT

1235
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,374
SUSPICIOUS WITH THEIR BAGS OR

1236
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,752
THEIR POCKETS LOOK A LITTLE MORE

1237
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,212
FULL OR, YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE

1238
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:55,922
THAT.

1239
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:56,297
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHO REALLY

1240
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,965
HAS IT.

1241
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,467
Jeff: ALICIA, WHAT ABOUT

1242
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,176
YOU?

1243
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,010
DO YOU WATCH PEOPLE, HOW THEY

1244
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,511
PICK UP THEIR BAG OR MAYBE

1245
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,846
WHAT'S IN THEIR POCKETS?

1246
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,555
OH, DEFINITELY.

1247
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,433
I NOTICE WHO TAKES THEIR BAGS TO

1248
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,644
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND WHO DOESN'T.

1249
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,311
I NOTICE WHAT SHORTS ARE WORN

1250
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,980
TODAY AND WHAT SHORTS AREN'T

1251
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,732
BEING WORN TODAY, YOU KNOW?

1252
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,317
Jeff: WHO DO YOU NOTICE

1253
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,986
WEARING DIFFERENT SHORTS?

1254
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,820
THE MEN.

1255
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,488
(LAUGHS)

1256
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,865
THEY'RE NOT IN THEIR SWIMMING

1257
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,367
TRUNKS AND HE'S GOT A LOT OF

1258
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,034
POCKETS THERE.

1259
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,786
Jeff: SO YOU'RE POINTING TO

1260
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,329
TROYZAN SAYING "THESE AREN'T THE

1261
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,331
SHORT HE IS NORMALLY WEARS"?

1262
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,875
NO, HE HAD ON SWIMMING

1263
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,627
TRUNKS.

1264
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,587
Jeff: TARZAN, WHAT DO YOU

1265
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,672
ANTICIPATE HAPPENING AFTER

1266
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,339
TONIGHT'S VOTE?

1267
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,632
I THINK THE ALLIANCE THAT I

1268
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,009
KNOW OF IS GOING TO STRENGTHEN

1269
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,135
AND THE FAITH WILL BE RESTORED

1270
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:43,844
AND THERE WILL BE A POWERHOUSE

1271
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,597
THAT WILL TAKE THEM TO THE END.

1272
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,015
IF PEOPLE JUST DO WHAT THEY SAY

1273
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,725
THEY WERE GOING TO DO BEFORE WE

1274
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,434
GOT HERE.

1275
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,020
AND OTHER THAN THAT, THE GAME IS

1276
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:53,396
AFOOT.

1277
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,731
(LAUGHTER)

1278
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,650
Jeff: ON THAT NOTE, CHELSEA

1279
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,359
HAS IMMUNITY.

1280
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,527
YOU CAN NOT VOTE FOR CHELSEA.

1281
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,195
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1282
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,863
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1283
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:12,957
TARZAN, YOU'RE UP.

1284
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,671
TARZAN, YOU'RE UP.

1285
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:26,220
I TOLD YOU NOT TO STEP DOWN.

1286
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:29,223
SORRY, KIM.

1287
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:29,724
YOU'RE THE STRONGEST PLAYER,

1288
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:39,608
HAVE TO SEE YOU GO.

1289
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,443
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO

1290
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,570
THIS BUT I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

1291
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:52,663
I LOVE YOU, MONKEY MAN.

1292
00:38:52,747 --> 00:39:08,429
I LOVE YOU, MONKEY MAN.

1293
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,097
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1294
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:15,227
VOTES.

1295
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,271
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1296
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,439
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW

1297
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:25,571
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1298
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,616
JEFF...

1299
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,659
SOME OF THE DUMBEST MOVES IN

1300
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,619
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY HAVE BEEN

1301
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,455
MADE WHEN SOMEONE GETS VOTED OUT

1302
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,457
AND HAS THIS IN THEIR POCKET AND

1303
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,585
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ME.

1304
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,463
