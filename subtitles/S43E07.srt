00:29:16,103 --> 00:29:17,213
- Okay.
- Yeah.

677
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,000
- So then five on James?
- Yeah.

678
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:22,136
<i>JESSE:
Right now
there's the easy route.</i>

679
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:24,211
<i>I could go
with the Vesi-Baka alliance,</i>

680
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,240
<i>and we can, you know,
split the votes between</i>

681
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:28,594
<i>James and Ryan,
and we could take out James.</i>

682
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:31,659
That's the route that Noelle
has sort of charted for us.

683
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:33,168
What are you hearing?

684
00:29:33,275 --> 00:29:35,995
I have a feeling that Noelle
is calling the shots.

685
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:38,553
<i>JESSE:
I go to Karla.
I genuinely trust Karla</i>

686
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:40,335
<i>more than I trust Noelle
right now. Like...</i>

687
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:42,478
We have, like,
so many similar experiences,

688
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:44,896
<i>and she reminds me
so much of my family.</i>

689
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,310
If we don't
get Noelle by surprise,

690
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:48,313
we're gonna be dead.

691
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,663
This could blow my game,

692
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,406
because I've been, like,
with Vesi, but, like,

693
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:53,371
- we have
to figure out something.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

694
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:54,820
- 'Cause you're seeing
the same thing I'm seeing.
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

695
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,382
<i>JESSE:
You can sit here in this game</i>

696
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:58,199
<i>and you can watch somebody like
Noelle accumulate this power</i>

697
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,406
<i>and, like, be like,
"Oh, you know what?</i>

698
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:00,788
<i>"Now is not the right time.</i>

699
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:02,544
<i>I'll try and, like,
weaken her eventually."</i>

700
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:03,826
Or you can make a move now.

701
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:08,549
She's gaming.

702
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:09,995
She's gaming so hard.

703
00:30:10,103 --> 00:30:11,763
<i>And so, I go to Cody,
and I'm asking him</i>

704
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,072
what his thoughts are.

705
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:14,932
I've never been
a huge fan of Dwight's.

706
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:19,034
- He's always kind of
been kind of eerie to me.
- Mm-hmm.

707
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:22,237
<i>He thinks, instead of Noelle,
we should go after Dwight.</i>

708
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:24,344
- Dwight's also
very good at this game.
- Yeah.

709
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,928
He's done the puzzles.
He's done all kinds of good...

710
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,624
<i>JESSE:
That's not
personally what I want,</i>

711
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:30,214
<i>but if I'm able
to take out Dwight</i>

712
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,070
<i>and weaken Noelle,
that's fine with me.</i>

713
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:35,662
And it also gives Cody,
like, a sense of agency, right?

714
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:36,923
Like, you don't want
to strip people

715
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,095
of their agency in this game.

716
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,447
It's gonna be a tough one.

717
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,211
Yeah.

718
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,790
We're exploring the option
of making a move already now

719
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:48,586
<i>and joining with Coco
against Dwight and Noelle.</i>

720
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,171
But Noelle...

721
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:56,025
<i>CODY:
This is a move
that's going to really</i>

722
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:57,517
<i>make things a little crazy.</i>

723
00:30:58,551 --> 00:30:59,451
Is it too soon?

724
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:00,717
It could be,

725
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,207
<i>but no matter what,</i>

726
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,950
<i>Jesse and I are gonna
be on the same page.</i>

727
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:23,130
I have the Knowledge Is Power Advantage,

728
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,172
meaning that I can
take someone's idol or advantage

729
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:26,475
if I know who they are

730
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,826
right before
the votes at Tribal Council.

731
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:30,971
Ooh.

732
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,410
<i>Right now I'm glad
I have something in my pocket,</i>

733
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,199
but it's the most nervous
I've been in the game.

734
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:40,141
<i>This is tricky just because,
once I take someone's idol,</i>

735
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:43,521
if I'm successful,
I have a huge target on my back.

736
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,280
Then, if I'm wrong,
I'm definitely going home.

737
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,689
I got Geo's
Knowledge Is Power right now.

738
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:53,483
<i>But using the Knowledge Is
Power to gain trust is very key.</i>

739
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:55,586
- I do have Knowledge Is Power.
- Okay.

740
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:57,279
<i>JAMES:
This Knowledge
Is Power Advantage</i>

741
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:59,969
<i>is something that I can use
to say, "Hey, I have this.</i>

742
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:01,338
<i>Let's work together."</i>

743
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:03,168
I trust you, and...

744
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:05,175
Yeah.

745
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:06,445
Knowledge Is Power.

746
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:07,820
- So...
- Knowledge Is Power, you can...

747
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:09,342
- Take an idol.
- Really?

748
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:11,028
Yes.

749
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,337
<i>CODY:
Oh, crap.
James has a Knowledge Is Power.</i>

750
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:16,028
<i>I still have
my immunity bracelet.</i>

751
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:18,137
<i>I know James knows I have it.</i>

752
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:19,791
<i>It may be time to vote him out.</i>

753
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:24,617
<i>Because now he is the most
dangerous player out here.</i>

754
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:26,074
<i>So, if for some reason</i>

755
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:28,032
<i>he would take
my immunity bracelet tonight...</i>

756
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,376
<i>...I've given it
to Jesse because</i>

757
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:34,722
<i>I feel it's safer with him
than with me at this time.</i>

758
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:36,859
We don't know what it is,

759
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:38,337
but it could be
another merge advantage,

760
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,716
- like we've seen
the past two seasons.
- Yeah.

761
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,278
It's probably
Knowledge Is Power, so...

762
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:44,406
- We're just... Yeah.
- We're trying to, like,
transfer everything around

763
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:46,130
to make sure James
will never guess who has what.

764
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,130
- Yeah. Yeah.
<i>- We don't know
what the advantage is,</i>

765
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:49,751
<i>so we're really
preparing for it to be anything.</i>

766
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:52,313
But, in the event
that it's Knowledge Is Power,

767
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,553
we already have a plan
set in place where,

768
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:55,825
<i>to cover our butts,</i>

769
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:58,141
we will do cross-tribe switches.

770
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:01,901
<i>It feels scary
to hand over my idol</i>

771
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,030
when that is the one piece
of power I have right now.

772
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:07,130
- Okay.
- Of course, you know, I'll
give it right back to you...

773
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,482
Oh, no, of course. No, yeah,
of course. I trust you.

774
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:11,786
<i>But I think my idol
is safer in Dwight's hands</i>

775
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:13,546
than it is in mine.

776
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:19,904
Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,280
Just in case
James decides to ask me

778
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,029
do I have
an idol or advantage...

779
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:27,283
Ooh. I like that.

780
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,899
...we decide that I'm gonna
give my advantage to Owen.

781
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,280
This is gonna be super quick.

782
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:33,889
- Yeah. Dwight filled me in.
- Yeah, perfect.

783
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,509
- Genius. All right.
Piece of cake.
- Thank you.

784
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:38,241
<i>OWEN:
Noelle gave me
her Steal a Vote in case</i>

785
00:33:38,344 --> 00:33:40,144
<i>James had found
Knowledge Is Power.</i>

786
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,171
<i>So we played
a little musical chairs,</i>

787
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:45,025
<i>a little shell game,
to try to cover it up.</i>

788
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:46,927
<i>And then, on top of all that,</i>

789
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,174
<i>we're trying to, like,
figure out who to vote out.</i>

790
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:52,095

that could go wrong tonight.

<i>JESSE:
There's so much that's
scary about tonight's vote.</i>

where, you know,</i>

793
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:02,867
<i>I just stick with the plan,
and we take out James tonight.</i>

794
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:06,655
The more risky route is that
me and Cody flip our votes,

795
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:08,718
<i>and we take out Dwight tonight,</i>

796
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,207

808
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:58,655
So, today
the challenge was designed

809
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:01,658
to really illustrate
this idea of earning it

810
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:03,378
every single step of the way.

811
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:05,452
Karla, you've
been banged up a lot.

812
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:07,761
Did you feel
that was a representation

813
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:09,522
of how difficult it really is

814
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,830
just to survive
one day out here?

00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:12,854
KARLA:
Uh, I mean, of course.

816
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,476
The first stage was the hardest,

817
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:16,164
and I feel like that was
our experience, at least for me,

818
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,136
- the first five days
were the hardest.
- Mm.

819
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,881
KARLA:
And then you get
to the second stage

820
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,820
and you're kind of like,
"I-I got the hang of this."

821
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:23,475
But I could see then
the third stage was like,

822
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:25,897
"Oh, no, you got to hold on,"
because you don't know

823
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,371
how long you have
until you're gone.

824
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:31,313
So, Jesse, y'all get
back to camp. What happens?

825
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,723
I think we're at this, like,
different stage of the game.

826
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:34,927
Earlier stage of the game,

827
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:36,337
we're going to Tribal
with six people.

828
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:37,789
It's, like,
almost like practice.

829
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:40,656
And now we're, like, in
the Colosseum, and we're like...

830
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:42,968
- There were
definitely talks happening.
- [laughter]

831
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:45,788
PROBST:
Dwight,
I have not heard any talk

832
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:48,406
about what I observed,
which was this sort of

833
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:50,617
Baka-Vesi versus Coco

834
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:53,104
or maybe helping each other.

835
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,716
It was talked about at one
of the challenges at the end.

836
00:35:55,827 --> 00:35:57,967
Did that just fall out
once you all got together?

837
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,028
Yeah, you know,
we all have the same color Buff.

838
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:01,682
We're all representing ourselves
at this point in the game.

839
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:03,074
There's no more, like, indication

840
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:04,452
of Vesi, Baka, Coco here.

841
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:05,621
That was in the past.

842
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:06,647
Let's move forward
as individuals

843
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:08,139
and play our own games.

844
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:10,901
Noelle, what talk is there,
at this stage,

845
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,240
about advantages or idols
that could be in the game?

846
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:15,934
NOELLE:
Going into Tribal Council,
if you're not thinking

847
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:18,199
someone has something, then
it's probably you going home.

848
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,578
You have to always be on your
feet about that kind of stuff.

849
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,100
You don't want someone
going home on your alliance

850
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:25,130
because someone else
played an idol or an advantage.

851
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:26,972
You have to have plan A,

852
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:29,998
plan B, plan C
and plan D, just in case.

853
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:32,933
So, James,
this idea of plan A, plan B,

854
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:34,664
plan C, plan D,

855
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:36,478
does that go through
your head all the time?

856
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:39,406
I mean, you still have
to weigh each relationship

857
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:42,067
with what they're saying,
and does the actual actions,

858
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:45,662
uh, back up
what's being said at Tribal?

859
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:48,688
So advantages are great.
Idols are great.

860
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:51,003
At the same time, you have
to know when to use them.

861
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:52,973
You have to know,
if you have an idol,

862
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:54,061
know if you're in trouble.

863
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:55,143
To use certain advantages,

864
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:56,509
you have to have
certain knowledge.

865
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,281
So a lot of people
have played advantages

866
00:36:58,379 --> 00:36:59,619
wrong and to their detriment.

867
00:36:59,724 --> 00:37:01,484
So you can't sit back
and just be worried

868
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,306
about advantages 24/7.

869
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:04,693
You can drive yourself crazy.

870
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:08,073
What you can do
is find a group of people

871
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,482
that you build trust with,
that give you a logical plan,

872
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:11,826
and you kind of stick to it.

873
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:14,621
PROBST:
Cody, give us a surfing analogy.

874
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,104
You're gonna go
surfing for the day.

875
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:18,306
Where are we right now?

876
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:19,863
At this point,

877
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:21,854
we're trying to decide
if we're gonna go in the water,

878
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:23,302
or if we're just gonna stay
on the beach with the girls

879
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:25,834
and the beers
and the umbrellas hanging out.

880
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:28,931
You know, it's that decision
of, are you gonna jump in

881
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:31,414
and play this game
and really go for it?

882
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:32,958
Or maybe just hang out
a little bit longer

883
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,550
and, uh, let it come to you.

884
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:37,515
So it's a little bit like <i>Jaws.</i>

885
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,590
You know
there's a shark somewhere.

892
