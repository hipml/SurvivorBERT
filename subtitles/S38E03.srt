Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,709
AT THE KARMA TRIBE ALL EYES WERE
ON THE RETURNING PLAYERS.

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,144
THEYVE HAD THEIR MOMENT TO
SHINE.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,045

5
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:16,416

00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,800
Jeff: BUT WAR DOG HAD HIS
OWN AGENDA.

00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,001
ITS GOT TO BE KEITH.

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,338
HOW IS KEITH IN THE GAME
HELPING THE WAR DOG OUT?

15
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,473
AND THE ANSWER IS, HE IS NOT.

16
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,942
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

THIS IS INSANE.

36
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,004
THIS IS ACTUALLY INSANE.

37
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,339

00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,301
THERE IS NO FOOD HERE.

IT SAYS THAT THERES THESE
STAIRS.

70
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,828
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE,
WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE

00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,602
I MEAN, GRANTED, THIS ISLAND IS

DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?

77
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,145
NO.

78
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,079
THERES NO STEP PATHS.

79
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,548
OH, MY GOD!

80
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:40,720
I DONT KNOW HOW FAR I NEED
TO GO OR IF IM JUST WANDERING

81
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,654
ENDLESSLY.

82
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,123
ITS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS
ISLAND IS HUGE.

APART AND BUILD A SLINGSHOT.

184
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,942
MANU HAS TO TOSS BY HAND, TAKING
MORE TIME.

185
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,346
YOUVE GOT TO GET THEM ALL IN
THERE.

186
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,815
MANU CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE AT
EVERY STAGE OF EVERY CHALLENGE.

187
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,983
YOURE GETGOOD!

188
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,885
GET OUT OF THERE, GUYS.

189
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:44,457
IT IS NOW A RACE TO DISASSEMBLE
THE WHEELBARROW AND BUILD A

190
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,424
SLINGSHOT.

191
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,759
GOOD JOB.

192
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,228
GOOD JOB.

193
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,397
Jeff: KAMA STRUGGLING TO
GET IT IN.

194
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,598
SOMETHING IS NOT LINING UP.

195
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,734
AND HERE COMES MANU NOW.

196
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,502
YOU WILL KNOW WHEN ITS IN.

197
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,672
IT WILL SEAT VERY NICELY.

198
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,341
MANUS GOES RIGHT IN.

199
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,442
YOURE GOOD!

200
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,745
IT IS NOW MANU IN THE LEAD.

201
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,514
KAMA STRUGGLING IT GET THIS
SLINGSHOT TO LINE UP.

202
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,415
NOW THEYRE GOOD.

203
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:13,319
ONCE AGAIN, CHRIS IS IN THE HERO
ROLE.

204
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,487
CAN HE GET IT DONE THIS TIME?

205
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,022
AND HE DOES.

206
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,256
MANU HAS THEIR FIRST.

207
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,395
ITS GOING TO BE GAVIN FOR KAMA
AND CHRIS FOR MANU.

208
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,863
THERE ARE FOUR TARGETS.

209
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,132
YOUVE GOT TO KNOCK DOWN ALL
FOUR.

210
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,802
GAVIN JUST MISSES.

211
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,105
CHRIS HITS THE SECOND TARGET FOR
MANU!

212
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,208
MANU HAS HALF THEIR TARGETS
DOWN, ONLY TWO LIFT.

213
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,610
GAVIN GOING TO STEP OUT.

214
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,879
HERE COMES JULIA TO GIVE IT A
GO.

215
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,748
BIG REWARD ON THE LINE.

216
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,885
JULIA KNOCKS THE FIRST TARGET
DOWN FOR KAMA.

217
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,953
SHES GOING TO GO AGAIN.

218
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,821
IT IS 2-1.

219
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,823
YOU GOT IT.

220
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:51,624
Jeff: CHRIS BACK.

221
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,092
AND HES GOT THE THIRD TARGET.

222
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,060
ONE TARGET LEFT.

223
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,831
ONE MORE!

224
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:02,134
Jeff: JULIE JUST MISSES ON
THE SECOND.

225
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,336
CHRIS COULD WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

226
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,904
LOVE IT, CHRIS, LOVE IT.

227
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,005
CHRIS, DONT MIS.

228
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,808
Jeff: AND HE DOES!

229
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:16,148
MANU WINS REWARD, THEIR FIRST
CHALLENGE OF THE SEASON!

230
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,517
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

231
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,420
WE NEEDED THAT WIN.

232
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,256
Jeff: MANU, FIRST WIN OF
THE SEASON.

233
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,157
ITS A BIG ONE.

234
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,426
WHATS IT GOING TO BE, COMFORT
OR CHICKENS?

235
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,227
CHICKEN.

236
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,395
CHICKEN.

237
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,998
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, MANU,
CHICKENS WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU

238
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,132
BACK AT CAMP.

239
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,767
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, AND ENJOY YOUR BEST

240
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,002
VICTORY.

241
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,503
CAM AI GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

242
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,037
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

243
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,871
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

244
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,307
THANKS, JEFF.

245
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,274
WE SHOULD BE HAPPY.

246
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,510
ITS OUR FIRST WIN.

247
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,581
BUT SUDDENLY, MY ANKLE STARTED
THROBBING WHEN I WAS LEAVING THE

248
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,051
CHALLENGE, AND I LOOKED DOWN AND
IT WAS REALLY TENDER, AND IT

249
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:56,255
STARTED LOOKING SWOLLEN, AND NOW
I CANT EVEN MOVE IT.

250
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,524
IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE.

251
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:17,476
♪ ♪
 WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

252
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,044
I DONT CARE.

253
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,612
JUST DROP ME WHEREVER.

254
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,415
IN THE SECOND PART OF THE
CHALLENGE WE HAD TO DISASSEMBLE

255
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:28,554
THE WHEELBARROW AND I LIFTED UP
A PIN AND IT FELL ON MY ANKLE.

256
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,490
I WAS SO FOCUSED ON THE
CHALLENGE I THOUGHT ILL WORRY

257
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,658
ABOUT IT LATER.

258
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,262
IT HURT AND I JUST PULLED MY
FOOT OUT, AND I GOT THE WHEEL

259
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,231
OUT, AND WE RAN TO FINISH.

260
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,299
AND I DIDNT NOTICE.

261
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,135
IT WAS HURTING BUT NOT THIS BAD.

262
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,439
AS IM WALKING TO CAMP, I GUESS
I CALMED DOWN OR SOMETHING, AND

263
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,942
IT JUST STARTED THROBBING AND
PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE AND

264
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,043
WORSE.

265
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,579
AND IM JUST, LIKE, WORRIED
BECAUSE IVE NEVER BROKEN

266
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,847
ANYTHING.

267
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,915
I DONT KNOW.

268
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,118
LIKE, I JUST EYE JUST DONT WANT
THIS TO BE SERIOUS.

269
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,722
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING, CALL US.

270
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,357
WELL GRAB IT FOR YOU.

271
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,025
OKAY?

272
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,762
LETS GIVE HER SOME SPACE.

273
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,898
I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT OUR
BEAUTIFUL CHICKENS.

274
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:17,303
OH, MY GOD!

275
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,073
NO, HES GOING TO BE DEAD.

276
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:25,778
THE CHICKENS, WE CAN EAT THE
CHICKENS BEFORE OUR MOST

277
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,912
IMPORTANT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

278
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,448
IM SO PUMPED.

279
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,050
ROTISSERIE CHICKEN SOUNDS
AMAZING, DOESNT IT?

280
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,553
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SIT HERE
IN PAIN AND LISTEN TO WHAT

281
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,990
THEYRE GOING TO DO TO THESE
CHICKENS AND ITS SO UPSETTING.

282
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,825
IM JUST LIKE, POOR CHICKENS.

283
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,794
WHAT DID THEY DO TO THE PLAYERS?

284
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,197
LIKE, THE PLAYERS SIGNED UP FOR
THE GAME NOT THE CHICKENS.

285
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,533
SO WHY SHOULD THEY BE PENALIZED.

286
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,002
IT TAKES A COUPLE OF HOURS TO
KILL IT, PLUCK IT.

287
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,170
WHO IS KILLING THE CHICKEN?

288
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,271
OH, GOD.

289
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,907
THERES NO WAY IM KILLING
ANYTHING.

290
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,742
IF THEYRE GOING TO LAY EGGS,
THATS AWESOME, THATS WHY WE

291
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,379
SHOULDNT KILL THEM ALL.

292
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:05,050
COMING INTO THIS GAME, I
ALWAYS SAID, IF MY TRIBE WERE TO

293
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,386
WIN CHICKENS, I WOULD RELEASE
THE CHICKENS.

294
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,224
BUT HOW-- HOW WOULD I BE ABLE TO
DO IT WITH THIS BUSTED ANKLE.

295
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,628
I THINK THEYRE GOING TO GET
AT LEAST ONE.

296
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,062
NOT TODAY.

297
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:21,233
DID THE CHICKENS DO?

298
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,303
YOU EAT CHICKEN BACK HOME,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

299
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,005
WERE BLEEDING HEART HYPOCRITES.

300
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,241
THESE CHICKENS DONT DESERVE
TO DIE.

301
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,543
IM WITH YOU.

302
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:34,880
CONVINCE THEM NOT TO KILL THE
CHICKENS THEN TO PROVE IT.

303
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:39,285
IM NOT I SETTING THE CHICKEN
FREE.

304
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,854
I WOULDNT TELL ON YOU.

305
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,924
BUT I THINK IT WOULD COME BACK
TO HAUNT YOU.

306
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,692
I NEED AN ACCOMPLICE.

307
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,829
--I-- I COUNT MY OUT.

308
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,930
COUNT ME OUT.

309
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,332
IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST
SURPRISING PART OF MY GAME SO

310
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:58,838
FAR WHEN WENDY ASKED ME TO BE AN
ACCOMPLICE IN A JAIL BREAK.

311
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,472
SHE WANTS TO SET CHICKENS FREE.

312
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,975
SHES LITERALLY WILLING TO
SACRIFICE HER ENTIRE GAME OF

313
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,677
"SURVIVOR" TO SAVE THESE
CHICKENS.

314
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,248
I DONT THINK IVE EVER MET
ANYONE LIKE WEND PEP SHES A

315
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,284
LOVABLE, EMOTIONAL NUT.

316
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:26,465
WE LOST THE REWARD CHALLENGE
TODAY, WHICH KIND OF SUCKS.

317
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,467
BUT WE HAVENT LOST AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE YET.

318
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,735
WE HAVENT HAD TO GO TO TRIBAL
YET.

319
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,971
AND THATS WAY MORE IMPORTANT.

320
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,339
YOU WERE SO GREAT.

321
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,440
THEY GOT LUCKY.

322
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,007
WHATEVER.

323
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,574
WERE ALL STILL HERE.

324
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,943
THATS ALL THAT MATTERS.

325
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,412
LETS REST TONIGHT AND LETS
CRUSH THEM TOMORROW.

326
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,917
I HAVE FOUND MYSELF IN A
GROUP OF SIX-- ME, JULIE, JULIA,

327
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,585
GAVIN, RON, AND ERIK.

328
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,754
WHICH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE
BECAUSE THERES A GENERAL

329
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,690
FEELING ON THE TRIBE THAT
RETURNING PLAYERS HAVE PLAYED

330
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,258
BEFORE.

331
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,492
THEYVE HAD THEIR SHOT.

332
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,695
THIS IS OUR FIRST CHANCE, AND WE
SHOULD GET TO PLAY BEFORE THEY

333
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,963
DO.

334
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:05,404
JOE AND AUBRY ARE A TARGET, AND
AURORA IS THE ONLY ONE WHO SEEMS

335
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,872
1,000% ON BOARD WITH THE
RETURNING PLAYERS.

336
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,277
SO IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE NEXT
IMMUNITY AND WE HAD TO GO TO

337
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,047
TRIBAL I THINK ONE OF THEMS GOT
TO GO.

338
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,751
HOARE YOU FEELING ABOUT
EVERYTHING?

339
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:19,385
ABOUT?

340
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,020
IF WE LOSE A CHALLENGE?

341
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,590
I FEEL LIKE IF WE LOSE, WEVE
GOT SIX OF US.

342
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,459
ITS A MATTER OF DECIDING WHICH
ONE OF THE THREE YOU WANT TO

343
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,729
VOTE OUT.

344
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,799
IN JOE AND AUBRY KIND OF COME
AS A PAIR.

345
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,400
THEY DO.

346
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,370
WHAT DO WE DO?

347
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,606
YOU AND AUBRY ARE A PAIR?

348
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,809
I MEAN, WE ARE KIND OF ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.

349
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,544
I DONT THINK THERE IS A
BARREL.

350
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,347
I MEAN OVERALL LIKE, YOU
KNOW, WHAT I MEAN.

351
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,349
OF ALL THE PEOPLE PLAYING IN THE
GAME.

352
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,984
OH, MY GOD.

353
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,054
JOE IS OVER THERE, AND I HAD NO
IDEA!

354
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,356
YOU GUYS FEEL GOOD?

355
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,560
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, WE CAN TELL
THAT YOU GUYS ARE ALL KIND OF

YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH
PIECES GO TOGETHER SO THAT THEY

543
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,498
FIT IN PERFECTLY.

544
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:04,903
THIS IS A PUZZLE IN THE FORM OF
A SHIPS WHEEL.

545
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,172
MANU WON THE LAST CHALLENGE FOR
REWARD.

546
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,575
THEY HAVE YET TO WIN AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

547
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,744
NO, THIS ISNT LONG ENOUGH,
RIGHT?

548
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:13,912
YES, IT IS.

549
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:14,746
IT WORKS.

550
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,014
Jeff: ITS ALL ABOUT
COMMUNICATION.

551
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:16,615
PERFECT.

552
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,751
WHERE DOES THIS ONE GO?

553
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,388
Jeff: KAMA QUICKLY BACK IN
THIS.

554
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,925
THEY THINK THEY HAVE THE SPOKES
TOGETHER.

555
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,294
GOOD JOB, KAMA!

556
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,962

00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,670

561
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,705

Jeff: THE TWO VETERANS,
DAVID AND WENTWORTH, STRUGGLING

565
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,446

GIVEN UP THE LEAD.

566
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,782
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE WITH
THE SPOKES.

567
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,050
THOSE DONT GO TOGETHER.

568
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,184
I KNOW.

569
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,619
THIS CANT GO HERE.

570
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,687
WHY IS THIS ON HERE?

571
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,856
Jeff: IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.

572
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:04,362
KAMA HAS A BIG LEAD RIGHT NOW,

573
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:08,733
KAMA MOVING ON TO THAT THIRD AND
FINAL SECTION.

00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,101
WHERE THEY PUT THE HANDLES IN.

575
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,136
OKAY, OKAY.

576
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,004
GO, GO!

577
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:18,410
Jeff: MANU IS WRONG AGAIN!

578
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,010
WOW!

579
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:24,749
KAMA THINKS THEY HAVE IT.

580
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,518

581
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,120

586
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,399
PUZZLES ARE HARD.

587
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,002
PUZZLES ARE HARD.

588
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:49,774
Jeff: KAMA, FOR THE THIRD
STRAIGHT TIME, IMMUNITY YOURS.

589
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,543

GRAB YOUR STUFF.

596
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,023
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

597
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,491
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

598
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,861
LOSING THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
WAS INCREDIBLY DEVASTATING, BUT

599
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,863
IVE ALWAYS BEEN WANTING TO
TARGET WENTWORTH, AND I THINK

600
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,100
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY
FOCUSED ON WENDY.

601
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,268
SO I HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO
TAKE OUT WENTWORTH.

602
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,971
I TRUST MY "SURVIVOR" INSTINCTS.

603
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:24,009
ITS TELLING ME RIGHT NOW TARGET
WENTWORTH.

604
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:43,161

605
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:50,935

607
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,840
I FEEL LIKE DITHE BEST I COULD
HAVE DONE.

608
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,375
IM REALLY SORRY, GUYS.

609
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,476
NO, NO.

610
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,344
IM SORRY.

611
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,680
YOU GUYS HAVE NOTHING TO BE
SORRY ABOUT.

612
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:05,583
IM BUMMED BECAUSE I KNOW ALL
EYES ARE ON ME AT THE MOMENT AND

613
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,986
I FEEL LIKE TONIGHT IM GOING
HOME.

614
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,722
THIS IS THE LOWEST OF LOW SO
FAR.

615
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,158
I JUST WANT TO COOK THE
CHICKEN FOR US.

616
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,626
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY WITH THAT?

617
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:15,660
IM OKAY WITH IT.

618
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,196
YOU DONT HAVE TO CONVINCE ME
TO KILL A CHICKEN.

619
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:22,200
IF ITS UP TO ME TONIGHT,
THEYRE NOT EATING THAT CHICKEN.

620
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,635
READY TO DO THAT THING.

621
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,570
I HAVE TO FIND MY FLINT.

622
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:26,171
WHERE IS THE FLINT?

623
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,606
THE FLINT IS ON THE...

624
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,308
DONT DO IT TO ME, ALL.

625
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,776
DONT DO IT TO ME.

626
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,611
ITS SUPPOSED TO GO THERE.

627
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,514
DUDE, IM THE LAST ONE THAT
STARTED IT.

628
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,348
AND IT WAS IN THAT AREA.

629
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,784
YOU THINK YOU LEFT IT IN THIS
AREA?

630
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,486
I DID NOT TOUCH IT FROM HERE.

631
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,621
I WOULD WAIT TO KILL THE
CHICKEN?

632
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,122
YEAH.

633
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:44,989
WHERES WENDY AT?

634
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:45,924
SHE WALKED OFF.

635
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,192
SHE WALKED OFF?

636
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,193
DOWN THE BEACH.

637
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,562
DO YOU THINK SHE TOOK IT TO
SAVE HER CHICKEN?

638
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,030
NO, THAT WOULD BE INSANE.

639
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,566
THAT WOULD BE PSYCHOTIC.

640
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,602
I TOOK THEIR FLINT.

641
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:58,870
IM SURE ITS AROUND HERE.

642
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,273
BEING THE SMATTER I AM, I
THOUGHT THEY CANT COOK A

643
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,275
CHICKEN WITHOUT FIRE.

644
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,312
AND THEY CANT MAKE A FIRE
WITHOUT FLINT.

645
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,947
IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT
WEBDY TOOK IT?

646
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,417
SHE WAS UP TO THE CAMP WHILE
WE WERE ALL TALKING AND AS SOON

647
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,319
AS WE WERE DONE, SHE RUNS AWAY.

648
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,221
SHE DID ACTUALLY COME TO
CAMP.

649
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,056
WOULD YOU MIND ASKING HER,
DUDE?

650
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,258
SHOULD I BE THE ONE.

651
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,493
JUST ASK HER.

652
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,361
, "GIRL, DO YOU HAVE THE FLINT?"
 ILL GO WITH YOU.

653
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:26,231
THE FLINT, IT DISAPPEARED,
AND THERES THIS THEORY FLOATING

654
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,234
AROUND THAT MAYBE WENDY TOOK IT
BECAUSE SHES BEEN AGAINST US

655
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,368
COOKING THE CHICKEN.

656
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,136
STRATEGY HERE.

657
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:31,903
APPROACHING HER.

658
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,138
HOW ARE YOU?

659
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:38,143
ILL LET YOU APPROACH, AND
ILL JUST KIND OF-- AT THE RIGHT

660
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,479
TIME ILL COME IN LIKE BAD COP.

661
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,681
EVERYONE IS LOSING THEIR MIND
BECAUSE OF THE FLINT.

662
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,552
THEYRE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT
TO VOTE OUT WENDY BECAUSE OF THE

663
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,255
CHICKEN DEBATE BUT I WANT TO
TAKE OUT WENTWORTH.

664
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,124
YOU MAY GET YOUR WISH ABOUT
THE CHICKEN.

665
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,193
WE ACTUALLY CANT SEEM TO FIND
THE FLINT.

666
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,061
YOU HAVENT SEEN IT LYING
AROUND, HAVE YOU?

667
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,263
CHRIS HAD IT.

668
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,500
YEAH, CHRIS HAD IT, AND HE
DOESNT KNOW WHERE HE PUT IT.

669
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,904
HE HAD IT THIS MORNING.

670
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:11,976
HOW DO YOU FEEL, TALKING SHOP
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TONIGHT.

671
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,779
LETS SAY I WERE TO BE GOING
HOME TODAY.

672
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,816
YOU MAY NOT GO HOME.

673
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,484
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING RIGHT
NOW?

674
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,252
IT WOULD BE COOL TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE.

675
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,487
ITS GOT TO BE KELLEY.

676
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,354
RIGHT.

677
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,490
BUT IFT REQUIRES SOME
CONVERSATIONS --

678
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,326
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD, AND IM
SORRY-- DONT THINK IM SULKING.

679
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,962
WENDY IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST
SMOKE SCREEN.

680
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:37,001
SHE HAS DELIVERED ON A SILVER
PLATTER, VOTE ME OUT.

681
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,206
WELL GET THE FIRE GOING.

682
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:41,840
DID YOU FIND IT.

683
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:42,841
SHE DIDNT TAKE IT.

684
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:43,975
SHE DID NOT.

685
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,409
NO.

686
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,777
I DONT, SO.

687
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,246
WHERE IS IT.

688
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,581
DAVID, ITS STILL WENDY.

689
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:50,715
YEAH, YEAH.

690
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,517
I DONT WANT TO VOTE OUT WENDY.

691
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,352
I THINK WENDY IS SOMEONE I CAN
USE.

692
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,253
SHES LOYAL TO ME.

693
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,821
SHELL VOTE WITH ME I THINK
EVERY TIME.

694
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,256
YOU WANT TO KILL THE CHICKEN?

695
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,224
YEAH.

696
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,093
WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS TO
SEND KELLEY HOME.

697
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,328
KELLEY WENTWORTH NEEDS TO GO
HOME.

698
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:09,234
AND NOW, ITS A MATTER OF
PULLING OVER CHRIS.

699
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,237
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
TONIGHT?

700
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,572
I THINK THE SAFEST THING TO
DO IS WENTWORTH.

701
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,106
WENTWORTH?

702
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,243
YEAH.

703
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,879
DONT SAY ANYTHING TO LAUREN OR
WAR DOG.

704
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,615
I THINK WAR DOG WOULD BE A
NUMBER.

705
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,983
IM GOING TO BE HONEST WITH
YOU.

706
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,519
I THINK-- I REALLY BELIEVE IN MY
HEART OF HEARTS IF YOU TELL WAR

707
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,190
DOG WHAT WERE DOING TONIGHT,
THIS ENTIRE THING BLOWS APART.

708
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,424
KELLEY IS NOT GOING HOME.

709
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,327
HES IN MUCH TIGHTER WITH HER
THAN ANYBODY KNOWS.

710
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,830
WENTWORTH, SHES TOO GOOD TO
KEEP AROUND.

711
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,567
THE PROBLEM SIM IN PRETTY CLOSE
WITH WAR DOG, AND DAVID WANTS IT

712
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,102
TO BE JUST US FOUR.

713
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:49,674
BUT BACK HOME IN MY REAL LIFE,
IM SOMEONE WHO IS OPEN WITH

714
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:50,842
EVERYBODY.

715
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:56,214
SO MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT I
BURN BRIDGES WITH SOME OF THE

716
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,516
RELATIONSHIPS IVE BUILT OUT
HERE.

717
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,517
JUST TO PREPARE FOR TONIGHT.

718
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,118
YEAH.

719
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:00,785
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

720
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,287
I MEAN, WENDY.

721
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,887
IS IT?

722
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,988
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

723
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,657
I MEAN, TALK TO ME.

724
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,158
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER IDEA?

725
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,426
WE COULD BRAINSTORM NOW.

726
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,494
YEAH.

727
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:12,330
I THINK ITS EITHER GOING TO BE
WENDY OR WENTWORTH.

728
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,832
SHE PLAYS THIS GAME KIND OF LIKE
A SNAKE, DUDE.

729
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:18,569
ILL GO WITH WHAT YOU WANT TO
DO.

730
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,338
WENDY SHOULDNT OBVIOUS VOTE
TONIGHT.

731
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,007
WENDYS GOT A HURT ANKLE.

732
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:27,979
WENDY DOESNT WANT ANYTHING TO
DO WITH ANY OF THE CHICKENS.

733
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:32,750
BUT CHRIS APPROACHED ME FOR THE
SECOND TIME TO KEEP OPTIONS OVER

734
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,785
TO TAKE OUT WENTWORTH.

735
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,421
I TRUST WENTWORTH MORE THAN
CHRIS.

736
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,991
I DECIDE MAYBE ITS NOT WENDY OR
WENTWORTH.

737
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:40,658
MAYBE ITS CHRIS.

738
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,160
CHRIS, HES OUT TO GET YOU.

739
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,261
THIS GUYS A PROBLEM.

740
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,896
I WANT HIM OUT.

741
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,165
THIS GUY--
 WHAT VOTES DO WE HAVE?

742
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,299
ITS BASICALLY FOUR-THREE,
RIGHT.

743
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,569
I JUST HAVE TO GET RICK AND
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT SHUSH.

744
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,104
TELL ME WHAT RICK SAYS.

745
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,939
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS GUY?

746
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,441
GET HIM OUT.

747
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,877
SO CHRIS IS COMING AFTER ME NOW,
SAYING MY NAME AND TRYING

748
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,147
POTENTIALLY PUT THIS PLAN
TOGETHER TO GET ME OUT.

749
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,582
THATS NOT GOING TO WORK FOR ME.

750
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,151
IF YOURE COMING FOR ME, LIKE,
YOU HAVE TO GO.

751
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,086
NO MORE WENDY.

752
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,289
VOTE CHRIS.

753
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,826
LOOK, HERES THE DEAL, CHRIS
SAYS LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY

754
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,328
THAT MAYBE WE TAKE WENTWORTH OUT
TONIGHT.

755
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,197
DID YOU ALREADY TALK TO HER
ABOUT THIS?

756
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,232
I TALKED TO HER FIRST.

757
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,433
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FIRST.

758
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,335
I DONT WANT TO BRING DAVID IN.

759
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,604
I DONT WANT TO BRING WENDY IN.

760
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,707
IF YOURE IN, WE BOTH TALK TO
LAUREN AND MAKE IT HAPPEN AND

761
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,776
TAKE ONE OF THE BIG THREATS OUT
OF THIS GAME.

762
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,244
OH, CRAP.

763
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,647
WAR DOG WANTS TO GET CHRIS OUT,
BECAUSE CHRIS IS GOING AFTER

764
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,583
KELLEY WHICH IM LIKE OH,
(BLEEP).

765
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,119
IM GLAD HE DOESNT KNOW IVE
BEEN GOING AFTER KELLEY.

766
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,321
IT WOULD BE YOU, ME, LAUREN AND
KELLEY?

767
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,589
YEAH, FOUR-THREE.

768
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,558
I DONT WANT TO ALIENATE
DAVID BECAUSE, LIKE, I DO THINK

769
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,726
HES A NUMBER FOR YOU AND I.

770
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,397
IF YOURE IN WITH THIS PLAN,
IM IN WITH YOU TALKING TO

771
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,398
DAVID.

772
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,067
IVE BEEN WAITING ALL GAME TO
MAKE A BIG MOVE.

773
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,835
APPARENTLY TODAY IS THE DAY FOR
BIG MOVES.

774
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,772
IT SUCKS BECAUSE NOW ITS ALL
COMING TO A HEAD, AND IM

775
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,609
GETTING PUSHED INTO A CORNER
WHERE IM GOG HAVE TO BETRAY

776
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:05,076
SOMEONE.

777
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:05,777
IM A VILLAIN NOW.

778
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,614
IVE BEEN TURNED INTO A VILLAIN.

779
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,886
SHE WASNT EVER SUPPOSED TO
KNOW HER NAME WAS COMING UP.

780
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:15,853
AND NOW SHE DOES.

781
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,021
SO--
 HE PLAYED HIMSELF.

782
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,557
WE WERENT GOING TO APPROACH
WARDOG.

783
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,925
WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

784
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:24,095
OH, MY GOD, NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
WENDY ISNT EVEN AN OPTION TO

785
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,698
VOTE FOR ANYMORE, WHICH WAS A
SIMPLE VOTE.

786
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,035
NOW ITS BECOME A VOTE BETWEEN
WENTWORTH AND CHRIS.

787
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,171
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE OUR
WAY.

788
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:33,738
WE DO.

789
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,006
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

790
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,610
WARDOG PAINT AID VERY PRETTY
PICTURE OF KELLEYS LOYALTY.

791
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,611
HERE SHE COMES.

792
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,612
YEAH.

793
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,614
NOW RICK AND I FIND
OURSELVESES IN THE MIDDLE.

794
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,450
WHATEVER NAME RICK AND I LAND
ON--

795
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,552
IVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO
SPEED.

796
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,553
OH, OKAY.

797
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,089
...THAT IS WHO SHOULD BE
GOING HOME TONIGHT.

798
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,591
DAVID, I DONT TRUST ANYBODY.

799
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,461
ON ONE HAND ITS GOOD TO VOTE
FOR WENTWORTH, BECAUSE SHES THE

800
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,396
PERSON I LEAST TRUST IN THIS
GAME.

801
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,466
BUT FUNNY THING IS, IF I VOTE
CHRIS OUT, NO ONE IN THE GAME

802
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,602
WOULD KNOW THAT IM THE ONE
COMING AFTER WENTWORTH.

803
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:09,073
NO MATTER WHAT, TONIGHTS TRIBAL
COUNCIL IS GOING TO BE HUGE.

804
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,909
SECRETS ARE GOING TO GET
EXPOSED.

805
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,811
BETRAILS ARE GOING TO GET
EXPOSED.

806
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:18,082
AND I THINK NOBODY IS GOG VIEW
ANY OF THOSE BETRAILS KINDLY OR

807
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,418
QUIETLY.

808
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:48,012
♪ ♪
 Jeff: SO , IF YOU WERE

809
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,182
WATCHING AT HOME HOW WOULD YOU
JUDGE THIS TRIBE?

810
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,416
LOSERS.

811
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,120
WE HAVE THREE IMMUNITIES AND ONE
WIN WE END UP WITH AN INJURED

812
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:56,821
PLAYER.

813
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,657
DONT FORGET ABOUT THE FLINT.

814
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,659
WE LOST THE FLINT IN CAMP
TODAY.

815
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,294
AND ARGUING OVER THE
CHICKENS.

816
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,462
IT WAS A DISASTER.

817
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,297
Jeff: LAUREN, WHAT WAS THE
ARGUMENT ABOUT THE CHICKENS?

818
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,368
WENDY DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD
NOT EAT A CHICKEN IF WE KILLED

819
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,502
IT.

820
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,804
I MEAN, I DIDNT FEEL LIKE IT
WAS MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT.

821
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,340
IT WASNT LIKE, "IM GOING TO
CAUSE CHAOS IF YOU GUYS KILL A

822
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:17,575
CHICKEN."

823
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,111
IT WAS BASICALLY, "I DONT FEEL
COMFORTABLE.

824
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,012
ILL STEP ASIDE."

825
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:25,383
Jeff: WARDOG, IS THAT YOUR
TAKE ON IT?

826
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,386
SHE EATS CHICKEN BACK HOME
WITH NO PROBLEM.

827
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,554
SHE SAID, YOURE RIGHT.

828
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,454
IM GOING TO BE A VEGETARIAN
NOW.

829
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,255
HOW IS THAT?

830
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,324
ITS ALMOST LIKE TALKING TO
MYSELF.

831
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,459
SHE HAS A LOT OF WARDOG IN HER.

832
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,627
WARPUP.

833
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,597
TECHNICALLY I HAVE BEEN
VEGETARIAN FOR EIGHT DAYS NOW,

834
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,766
SO IM THAT STUBBORN.

835
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,937
Jeff: SO, DEVENS, WHEN YOU
LOSE ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER

836
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,774
ANOTHER, THERES A POINT WHERE
IT MIGHT JUST BECOME I HAVE TO

837
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:50,875
KICK INTO GAME MODE.

838
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,145
I CANT WORRY ANYMORE ABOUT THE
TRIBE.

839
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,715
THE FIRST TWO TRIBALS WAS
BASED ON WE NEED TO GET STRONGER

840
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,450
AND ITS NOT WORKING.

841
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:02,653
SO YOU HAVE TO RE-EVALUATE, AND
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD THAT

842
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,622
RUNNING THROUGH THEIR MINDS
TODAY.

843
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,657
Jeff: WENTWORTH, DID YOU
FEEL A SHIFT AFTER TODAYS LOSS,

844
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,092
THREE THIS A ROW.

845
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,928
SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE.

846
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,231
WERE OBVIOUSLY DOING
SOMETHING LONG AND ITS COMING

847
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,398
DOWN TO LOYALTY.

848
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,866
AS WE GET SMALLER AND SMALLER
AND THAT YOU RECALL, YOURE

849
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,169
GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST THE
PEOPLE YOURE WITH.

850
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,305
Jeff: DAVID, ITS AN
INTERESTING IDEAL IF A TRIBE

851
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,976
WERE TO GIVE UP ON ITSELF AND
LTS ABILITY TO WIN, THEN

852
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,478
SOMEBODY WHO IS SLOWING YOU DOWN
IN CHALLENGES ISNT AS BIG A

853
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,713
PROBLEM.

854
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,549
WELL, THATS, I THINK,
EXACTLY WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN

855
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,717
TONIGHT.

856
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,553
SO WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS A
LIABILITY IN A CHALLENGE IS

857
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,754
IRRELEVANT.

858
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,557
I THINK THAT TONIGHT IS REALLY
ABOUT ELIMINATING THE BIGGEST

859
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,158
SOCIAL THREAT.

860
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,961
Jeff: WENTWORTH, THAT
SEEMED TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

861
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,865
YEAH, I MEAN-- THERE COULD BE
MULTIPLE PLANS GOING ON.

862
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,666
IM NOT SURE.

863
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,934
UHM...

864
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,236
Jeff: I RARELY SEE YOU
BEING UNABLE TO ANSWER.

865
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,406
IM TRYING TO PROCESS WHAT
DAVID SAID.

866
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,577
DONT WORRY --
 YEAH, DONT WORRY ABOUT IT.

867
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,379
HES JUST TALKING.

868
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,114
WARDOG, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
DAVIDS COMMENTS?

869
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,684
A LOT OF HIS COMMENTS KIND OF
THROW ME A LITTLE BIT OFF

870
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:07,551
BALANCE, TO BE HONEST.

871
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,120
IM STICKING TO MY PLAN.

872
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,522
AND I THINK COHESION IS THE BEST
WAY FORWARD.

873
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:15,226
Jeff: WENDY, WHEN YOU HEAR
THIS COMMENT FROM DAVID, DOES IT

874
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:19,030
MAKE GU, "OH, MAYBE THERES MORE
GAME AFOOT?"

875
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:23,367
HONESTLY, WHATEVER HAPPENS IN
TRIBAL COUNCIL, I ALWAYS FEEL

876
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,070
LIKE THE TRIBE IS A PYRAMID OF
