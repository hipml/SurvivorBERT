JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,796
<i>16 strangers were abandoned</i>

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,716
<i>deep in the heart</i>
<i>of the Amazon jungle.</i>

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,592
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>the tribes</i>

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,636
<i>were divided</i>
<i>into men and women.</i>

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,265
This place was discovered
in 1541-- Spanish explorer.

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,101
He encounters a tribe
of very fierce female warriors.

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,561
This was the first notion

9
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,105
that women could survive
just fine on their own.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,941
That is where the term
"Amazon women" comes from.

11
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,109
(cheering)

12
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,152
Shove off!

13
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,612
<i>From the start,</i>
<i>the women had trouble.</i>

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,781
SHAWNA:<i> I just felt so stupid,</i>
<i>with the guys going off</i>

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,116
<i>one way, the girls</i>
<i>couldn't untie...</i>

16
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,451
well, I couldn't
untie the knot.

17
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,078
PROBST:<i> When the Jaburu women</i>
<i>finally arrived at camp...</i>

18
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,788
(whooping)

19
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,582
<i>...Christy revealed her secret.</i>

20
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,752
And every tribe member
should know that I am deaf.

21
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,128
JENNA:<i> I'm wondering</i>
<i>how she's going to be able</i>

22
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,755
<i>to work with the group</i>
<i>when she can't</i>

23
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,673
-really hear well.
-PROBST:<i> From the beginning,</i>

24
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,260
<i>some of the women found</i>
<i>surviving in the Amazon</i>

25
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,928
<i>tougher than they</i>
<i>ever imagined.</i>

26
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,097
I don't know if I can do
a challenge tomorrow.

27
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,432
I'm having trouble walking.

28
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,184
PROBST:
<i>They didn't catch many fish.</i>

29
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,685
HEIDI:
<i>I was pretty sure</i>

30
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,187
<i>that after you gutted</i>
<i>the thing,</i>

31
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,188
<i>there would've been...</i>
<i>there's just</i>

32
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,439
nothing even left.

33
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,982
I feel like I'm eating
vomit right now.

34
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,859
PROBST:<i> And they had trouble</i>
<i>building shelter.</i>

35
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,278
-Oh, my God!
-(screams)

36
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,988
PROBST:<i> At Tambaqui,</i>
<i>things were different.</i>

37
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,990
ALL:
Tambaqui!

38
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,825
PROBST:
<i>The guys finished their shelter</i>

39
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,827
<i>under Roger's</i>
<i>self-proclaimed leadership.</i>

40
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,038
We need them about three
feet long-- the Y's--

41
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,207
and there should be
plenty of them, okay?

42
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,459
ROB:<i> I know how to play</i>
<i>this game. I say, "Yes, Roger.</i>

43
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,877
Yes, Roger. Sure, Roger."

44
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,337
PROBST:<i> And the tribe</i>
<i>felt confident.</i>

45
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,713
Yo, we're the favorites
right now.

46
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,839
RYAN:
<i>Bottom line is,</i>

47
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,050
<i>a lot of girls</i>
<i>over there are eye candy,</i>

48
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,635
<i>but when it comes down to it,</i>

49
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,386
you want people
that are going to be useful.

50
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,222
Survivors ready? Go!

51
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,516
<i>At the first immunity</i>
<i>challenge, the Tambaqui men</i>

52
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,683
<i>quickly jumped ahead.</i>

53
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,186
You're good.
Feet can't touch! No!

54
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,146
Daniel and Ryan,
got to head back.

55
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,690
<i>But Ryan and Daniel</i>
<i>blew the men's lead.</i>

56
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,067
Hug the log!

57
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,528
<i>And Heidi led the women</i>
<i>to victory.</i>

58
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,530
Jaburu wins immunity!

59
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,824
<i>Tambaqui went</i>
<i>to Tribal Council,</i>

60
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,826
<i>where Ryan was the first person</i>

61
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,077
<i>voted out of the tribe.</i>

62
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,538
Ryan, the tribe has spoken.

63
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,083
<i>15 remain.</i>

64
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,127
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

65
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,756
JANET:<i> We've been sleeping</i>
<i>in the elements</i>

66
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,507
<i>for four nights now.</i>

67
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,052
<i>The shelter that we have</i>
<i>does not, you know,</i>

68
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,178
live up to its name.

69
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,262
It does not shelter us.

70
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,931
Look at it. It goes...
(makes high-pitched noise)

71
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,682
It's-it's narrower over here
and wider over here.

72
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,809
-Mm-hmm.
-SHAWNA: What we wanted do there

73
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,437
was reinforce the center
because it's breaking.

74
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,315
HEIDI:<i> There's not a roof</i>
<i>over our heads</i>

75
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,984
<i>because there's so many</i>
<i>other priorities going on.</i>

76
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,528
<i>Like, number one is water.</i>

77
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,658
<i>Everybody's energy is being</i>
<i>in that fire and water.</i>

78
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,910
<i>Water, fire, water, fire.</i>
<i>I mean, we just...</i>

79
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,995
it takes everyone's energy
just to do that.

80
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,955
DEENA:
We need to designate.

81
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,208
We need one person
on fire, water, logs.

82
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,168
JEANNE: Okay, one person--
fire, water, logs.

83
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,003
Who's going to do that?

84
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,297
JEANNE:
<i>Our camp is so disorganized,</i>

85
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,091
<i>because we don't have a leader.</i>

86
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,885
<i>You really need to bring it</i>
<i>together and unify it</i>

87
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,929
and work as a team,
and without a leader,

88
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,180
we're not going to get it
together.

89
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:28,017
See, since we are not using
this section, are we, like...

90
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,020
I mean, do we want to try
to go, like, tepee style?

91
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,022
I really don't care if we
have a high ceiling or not.

92
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,357
-I don't care, either.
-I don't know.

93
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,858
I think those poles are fine.

94
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,236
So A-frame could be
the way to go.

95
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,821
SHAWNA:<i> We don't have</i>
<i>the necessary stuff</i>

96
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,155
<i>to survive right now.</i>

97
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,991
<i>We are not surviving.</i>

98
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,284
<i>I think the guys</i>
<i>are much better off than us.</i>

99
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,911
<i>I have no doubt that</i>

100
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,414
they probably had their stuff
together before we did.

101
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,095
Guys, this looks delicious.

102
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,851
ALEX:<i> Here we are in the Amazon,</i>
<i>in this rain forest,</i>

103
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,855
<i>and we've built our shelter,</i>
<i>we're making do with our food.</i>

104
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,856
We did finally figure out

105
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,858
how to use the manioc flour,
instead of just

106
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,693
<i>eating it dry, which was nice.</i>

107
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,778
MATTHEW:
Hotcakes are on, boys!

108
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,572
ALEX:
<i>We're surviving.</i>

109
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,868
Not the Ritz,
but it's... it's pretty cool.

110
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,412
It's hot, guys. You have to
balance it in your hands.

111
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,913
What a bunch
of lamebrains we are.

112
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,373
This is the way to do it.

113
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,624
It's filling.

114
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,543
It's filling,
and it tastes average.

115
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,711
It's great.

116
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,921
All right.
We going to fish?

117
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,131
Let's fish.

118
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,133
-Here we go.
-Here we go.

119
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,762
All right, ready?

120
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,014
Yeah, here we go, guys--
right side.

121
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,891
Easy on the left side.

122
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,934
Good job, guys.

123
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,770
ROGER:
<i>The last few days here</i>

124
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,772
<i>have been</i>
<i>a little embarrassing.</i>

125
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,607
<i>Uh, we lost the first</i>
<i>immunity challenge,</i>

126
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,775
<i>but we've established</i>

127
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,110
a... a very good team.

128
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,612
All right, everybody ready?

129
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,947
One, two, three.

130
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,282
That was a good one.

131
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,451
-Yeah, nice cast.
-Coordinated effort.

132
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,287
DAVE:<i> I think what we're doing</i>
<i>is really settling down</i>

133

to a schedule.

134
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,624
We... we got our shelter built.
Uh... we're

135
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,751
<i>assessing our food.</i>
<i>You know, what do we need to do</i>

136
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,295
<i>in order to sustain ourselves</i>
<i>for the long haul?</i>

137
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,255
BUTCH: One, two, guys,
we're getting her down.

138
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,424
It's going to take a while.

139
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,927
One, two, three.

140
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,183
(thunder crashing)

141
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,813
They look pretty angry.

142
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,689
Getting a little concerned?

143
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,983
-Want to go back to camp, guys?
-You can hear it. -Yeah.

144
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,276
All right, Tambaqui, let's get

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,653
-on the move.
-Let's go.

146
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,988
One, two, three.

147
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,323
Wind's to our back.

148
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,826
It was so sunny a minute ago.

149
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,829
DAVE:<i> Not seconds</i>
<i>before we got back, it...</i>

150
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,497
it just dumped.
It rained hard.

151
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,333
(thunder crashing)

152
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,502
(whooping)

153
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,254
ALEX:
<i>It came down in buckets.</i>

154
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,967
<i>But inside the shelter,</i>

155
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,927
<i>there were a couple of drips</i>
<i>here and there;</i>

156
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,804
pretty much, we were dry.

157
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,058
It'd suck to be outside
right now.

158
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,102
(thunder crashing)

159
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,702
Have a seat near the fire.

160
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,998
I am so cold right now.

161
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,211
Right now... a

162
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,714
ridiculous,
horrendous storm just hit us,

163
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,842
and we're getting buckets...
buckets of water on us.

164
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,886
The ground's fallen through.

165
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,555
Our... our stakes are flimsy.

166
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,892
We didn't get our structure up
in time, so we are wet.

167
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,061
We lost our flint,
so we can't rebuild a fire.

168
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,231
So, right now, we're focusing
on the fire shelter.

169
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,568
And, um, these palms
are... are crap,

170
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,862
so we're trying to figure out
how to weave them together

171
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,530
to ensure that that thing
doesn't go out,

172
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,032
'cause that's our lifeline,

173
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,910
and serious trouble
if that gets hit.

174
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,163
I can't believe
how badly this sucks.

175
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,415
We thought we'd have
more time than this.

176
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,542
Forgot that we're in
the middle of the Amazon,

177
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,836
and that torrential rainstorms
come by daily.

178
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,777
Okay, it is your first
reward challenge.

179
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,446
Today, we're going to test
how well you communicate.

180
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,949
Your ability to listen
to each other and take direction

181
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,408
will determine the outcome.

182
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,701
<i>It'll consist of a puzzle,</i>

183
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,621
<i>which will demand teamwork</i>
<i>to build. The 30 pieces</i>

184
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,497
required

185
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,665
<i>to solve your puzzle</i>

186
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,458
<i>have been scattered</i>
<i>in the jungle clearing.</i>

187
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,459
<i>You're going to pick</i>

188
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,961
one tribe member.

189
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,087
They're going to be your guide.

190
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,257
The other tribe members
will be blindfolded in pairs.

191
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,009
The guide
will navigate the pairs

192
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,137
<i>through the clearing,</i>
<i>which has trees and logs</i>

193
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,515
<i>and mud,</i>
<i>as you gather the pieces.</i>

194
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,809
Once you've gathered
all 30 pieces,

195
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,310
you can take your blindfolds off

196
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,979
and start to put
the puzzle together.

197
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,856
First tribe to complete
the puzzle wins reward.

198
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,316
Want to know
what you're playing for?

199
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,484
-Yeah.
-Well, the river

200
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,987
is a source of a lot of food.

201
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,488
Outside of both
your guys' camps,

202
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,156
there really are fish this big,

203
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,450
and the best way
to catch them: fish bait.

204
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,160
-Oh.
-Oh, yeah.

205
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,495
-Whoo!
-Nice.

206
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,122
There's a lot of bait here.

207
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,623
Should provide a lot of food.

208
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,000
Jaburu, because you have
one extra member,

209
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,959
you're sitting somebody out.

210
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,336
You also have to decide
who your guides are.

211
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,504
Jaburu, who's sitting out?

212
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,047
Christy, you're sitting out.

213
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,799
Who's your guide?
Joanna.

214
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,259
Tambaqui, who's your guide?

215
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,344
Butch.
Let's get blindfolded up.

216
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,141
All right, guys, here we go,
for reward.

217
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,018
Survivors ready?
Go!

218
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,394
Each of you guys turn around.

219
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,812
Turn around the other way.

220
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,647
All right, first thing-- Roger,

221
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,399
you're going to go forward
five steps.

222
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,984
Shawna, go forward ten paces.

223
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,986
Just go forward. It's a...
it's a tree stump

224
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,030
in front of you, Shawna,
but keep going. Step high.

225
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,283
Hey, um, Ro-Roger,
turn around to your right.

226
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,160
More. Straight ahead.

227
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,037
Reach your left hand out,
Shawna. There you go.

228
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,873
-Come to me. -BUTCH: That's it.
No, no, no, no.

229
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,667
Dan, not you. Not you, Dan.
Roger. All right, bring it back.

230
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,045
Heidi, go forward ten spaces,
to your right.

231
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,087
BUTCH:
That's right where you started.

232
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,505
Now, keep going.
Whoa. Stop there.

233
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,715
-Hold on a second.
-Drop that board.

234
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,051
PROBST: Guys, remember, this
is about clear communication.

235
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,094
Whoa. Right there.
Whoa, stop, stop.

236
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,554
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

237
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,722
All right, now, straight ahead.

238
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,223
PROBST:
Tambaqui, you got to talk

239
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,560
-to each other.
-Uh, uh, Roger...

240
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,228
I mean, Dave. Dave.

241
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,938
All right, straight ahead
15 steps.

242
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,940
Heidi, left, left, left, left.
There you go.

243
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,567
PROBST: Girls are way ahead
of the guys.

244
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,902
Rob... excuse me, Alex.

245
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,780
I'm sorry, Mitch...
Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.

246
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,906
Right, there it is.

247
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,282
Okay, you guys, turn around.

248
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,575
Shuffle-step back toward me.

249
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,410
I can't see my other guy.

250
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,912
Tambaqui, you better pick it up.

251
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,414
Drop your piece.
Drop your piece.

252
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,751
That's 27 Jaburu, 18 Tambaqui.

253
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,128
Alex, reach down.

254
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,089
No, not that. That's a stick.

255
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,049
Jaburu down
to three pieces left.

256
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,675
JOANNA:
Drop it, Shawna.

257
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,676
Butch, put the sign down?

258
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,053
No, no, not you. I'm sorry.

259
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,097
Uh, Matthew, all right,
to your left.

260
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,473
Left, left, left.

261
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,558
PROBST: The girls
are way ahead of the guys.

262
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,559
Three...
three more steps, Alex.

263
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,436
Keep coming-- three more steps.
One, two, three,

264
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,438
-four, stop. -JOANNA: Come
right, you got our last piece.

265
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,439
Come on, Jenna.
Keep coming to me.

266
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,774
Step forward, this way.

267
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,942
Follow my voice!
Follow my voice! Drop it!

268
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,277
PROBST: That's it for Jaburu.
Take off the blindfolds.

269
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,238
-Start solving the puzzle.
-JOANNA: Let's go, Jaburu!

270
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,156
-Take the blindfolds off!
-We can take them off?

271
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,117
-Let's put the puzzle together.
-PROBST: Jaburu is starting

272
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,953
on the puzzle.

273
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,121
Let's go, Tambaqui.
You're still in this.

274
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,623
-Butch, this is it, right?
-Butch! -BUTCH: To your left.

275
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,999
You got it, Roger,
to your left.

276
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,626
-Keep going.
-This is Roger! Is this it?

277
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,710
Right there's a frame.
Right there's a frame.

278
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,004
-Come around the frame.
-Is that the right sign?!

279
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,798
Alex... or Dave, Dave,
Dave, Dave, you go

280
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,591
to your right now,
to your right now.

281
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,178
-Butch! -All right, Alex, you're
going to stop right there.

282
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,305
Wait. I need a vine.

283
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,516
Looks like an "E."

284
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,725
Butch!

285
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,519
Roger, keep following
my voice back.

286
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,479
JEANNE: Now I need a corner
of a square.

287
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,981
BUTCH: Now, you guys come
toward me, straight ahead.

288
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,608
We're in. Go, drop it.
Now, take your time, guys.

289
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,485
Tambaqui,
take off your blindfolds.

290
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,320
Start solving your puzzle.

291
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,614
Jaburu has a big lead.

292
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,783
-Got to be a top one.
-It's got nothing on it?

293
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,618
No, it's got...
turn it over, Butch.

294
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,247
I need bright yellow.

295
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,958
See these square... these, uh,
triangles right here?

296
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,127
Those are the teeny corners.
Does anyone have any yellow...?

297
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,004
PROBST: Make sure to check
the puzzle reference.

298
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,632
You guys may be closer
than you think with a piece.

299
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,515
We need fish. We need fish.

300
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,809
-Oh, right there.
-Whoo!

301
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,189
We're having dinner tonight.

302
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,356
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

303
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,524
Whoo!

304
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,526
-Jaburu wins reward!
-Yeah, baby!

305
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,197
-Oh, yeah. -Wins their second
challenge in a row.

306
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,703
From what I know about the
Amazon, you should be eating

307
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,913
very well for the next couple
of days.

308
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,039
Fish will love this.

309
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,081
Congratulations.

310
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,667
You are two for two.
Celebrate.

311
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,669
You the man.

312
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,492
ROGER:
I have to admit,

313
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,744
I'm not accustomed
to losing to women.

314
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,412
I don't care what it is.

315
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,373
It's just not my deal.

316
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,959
Not that I'm a chauvinist.
It just...

317
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,418
BUTCH:
It's just my personality

318
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,087
that makes a man do it,
and I'm...

319
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,630
something like that,
I expect to win.

320
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,049
We got our asses kicked, though.

321
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,679
DAVE:<i> I think the mood in camp</i>
<i>is a little frustration.</i>

322
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,930
<i>I mean, everybody wants to win.</i>

323
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,723
And, particularly,

324
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,601
seven guys don't want to lose
to a bunch of girls.

325
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,812
If you win, it's great,
but if you lose,

326
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,564
no... no matter
who you are out here,

327
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,649
you have a tendency
to want to blame yourself.

328
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,442
We were running around
like chickens

329
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,444
-with their heads cut off.
-Yep.

330
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,904
ALEX:<i> We're feeling</i>
<i>the pressure a lot.</i>

331
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,447
<i>And there's a lot</i>
<i>of pressure on us now.</i>

332
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,407
<i>We've lost two in a row.</i>

333
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,617
(chuckles)
We could have used that bait.

334
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,785
Bait would have been nice.

335
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,579
DAVE: I think, you know,
we got an immunity challenge,

336
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,621
-what, in two days?
-Yep.

337
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,455
We'll go into that.

338
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,000
I think, if we take
a deep breath--

339
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,376
ten, 15 seconds-- sit back

340
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,628
and work on it as a team,
we'll be all right.

341
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,231
Good batch.

342
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,649
JEANNE:
Is it?

343
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,817
Mmm, mmm!

344
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,152
That tasted like you put

345
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,862
some beautiful spices
in it today.

346
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,156
HEIDI: 'Cause I did try to burn
it a little bit more,

347
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,532
since it was wet in there.

348
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,034
JEANNE:
<i>We need food-- real food.</i>

349
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,243
<i>The manioc--</i>

350
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,287
the fried manioc or whatever--

351
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,164
burnt manioc--
was just no good.

352
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,124
-Oh, it's disgusting.
-Yeah, it really is.

353
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,834
It's got maggots
just everywhere in there.

354
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,711
Aah! I didn't know
about the maggots.

355
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,213
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh...

356
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,966
I did not know about them.

357
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,762
JANET:<i> Mentally,</i>
<i>I can handle this game great,</i>

358
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,180
<i>but physically,</i>

359
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,641
it's really, you know,
taking its toll,

360
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,517
and it's so much tougher
than I thought.

361
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,519
-I just wish we could
catch some fish. -I know.

362
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,646
Did you get any nibbles?

363
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,564
-Did they go for it?
-Yeah, I got... I got about six.

364
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,857
I saw them.

365
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,817
JENNA:<i> We've had nothing to eat</i>
<i>in, like, five days.</i>

366
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,028
<i>Barely anything to eat.</i>

367
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,696
But, for the challenges,
I mean, so far,

368
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,906
we've... we've done really well.

369
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,658
We've won them both
over the guys,

370
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,326
who are very cocky
and think that they...

371
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,994
they were going to beat us
both times.

372
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,124
JEANNE:
My fishing technique is,

373
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,378
put the bait on the hook
and pray.

374
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,380
<i>We've had</i>
<i>a few problems fishing.</i>

375
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,382
<i>Nothing was really biting</i>
<i>out here.</i>

376
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,218
This stuff is tough,
whatever this is.

377
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,886
<i>And you can see them.</i>
<i>They're all around you.</i>

378
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,429
<i>They're jumping.</i>

379
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,223
Come on, fishies.

380
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,433
Come on!

381
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,852
Oh, there's a beauty coming up.

382
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,730
Oh, yes!

383
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,233
(squealing)

384
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,110
Gosh darn it.

385
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,365
JEANNE:<i> Bait's working.</i>
<i>We're going to get fish.</i>

386
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,659
<i>Need a little time</i>
<i>and a little patience,</i>

387
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,536
but I feel better
about the future

388
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,414
because now we have the bait,
and I know how to fish,

389
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,666
and it's going to be okay.

390
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,218
ALEX:<i> My trouble is people who</i>
<i>tell other people how to live.</i>

391
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,553
-I'm doing okay so far. -As long
as you're not hurting...

392
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,555
as long as you're not
hurting somebody.

393
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,723
-Yeah.
-If they want to believe

394
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,932
what they want to believe,

395
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,267
-that's all fine and well.
-Mm-hmm.

396
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,810
It's just like the gay issue.

397
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,979
I mean, it doesn't matter to me.

398
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,774
ROB:<i> I was really stumped</i>
<i>on who I could get</i>

399
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,777
that might vote against Roger,
up until this morning,

400
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,779
when a lightbulb
went off in my head.

401
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,782
As long as they don't
bother me, I don't give a damn.

402
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,660
I don't like to see them
flaunting it, though.

403
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,454
-I mean, that...
-Really?

404
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,289
You like to see two guys
out on the street...

405
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,166
-Doesn't bother me at all.
-...making out and all that?

406
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,584
-I don't care.
-It doesn't bother you at all?

407
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,668
No. Could care less.

408
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,587
Alex and Roger had

409
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,672
a little bit
of a tiff this morning

410
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,257
<i>-over homosexuality.</i>
-You don't know!

411
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,925
You've never been
in the situation, and you're...

412
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,969
Alex, that is not natural.

413
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,846
-Period. -Who said...
who said anything about natural?

414
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,931
ALEX:<i> First of all,</i>
<i>I'm straight, so I don't know</i>

415
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,349
what it is to be homosexual,

416
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,643
and Roger is straight,
so he doesn't know, either.

417
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,272
<i>What it comes down to is,</i>
<i>if it's what makes you happy</i>

418
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,483
<i>and if it's not</i>
<i>hurting anybody,</i>

419
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,443
then who cares?

420
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,112
The sex part of it that goes
with the male and the woman...

421
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,614
-Mm-hmm.
-...is to procreate.

422
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,157
-Yeah. So you're only...
-It's an expression...

423
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,326
So what you're saying is,
you've only had sex two times--

424
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,161
the two times you wanted
to procreate, that was

425
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,455
-the only times you've had sex
with your wife? -No. No.

426
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,790
Okay, then it
wasn't about procreation.

427
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,542
-It wasn't. Sorry. -ROB:<i> Now,</i>
<i>what I'm hoping is that</i>

428
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,670
this has planted the seed
in Al... in Alex's head

429
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,507
<i>that Roger may not be</i>
<i>all he's cracked up to be.</i>

430
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,217
Roger is a bigot.

431
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,843
You tell me why it is not wrong.

432
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,386
-I'll tell you why
it's not wrong. -Okay.

433
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,514
Because I know people
who live their life

434
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,350
for a long time
being "straight,"

435
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,270
and they came out of the closet
and have had more love

436
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,731
and joy and happiness
as a result of doing that

437
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,358
-and being true to themselves...
-Mm-hmm.

438
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,026
...than they ever
would have living a lie.

439
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,861
-Mm-hmm.
-That's why it's okay.

440
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,155
-That makes it okay?
-Absolutely.

441
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,699
ROGER: You have your opinion,
and I have mine.

442
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,701
-Okay.
-And you can't convince me,

443
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,412
-and I can't convince you.
-I don't want to convince you.

444
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,457
I have no desire
to convince you at all.

445
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,428
-(water sloshing)
-JANET: I'm disoriented.

446
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,721
Are we on the trail that...?

447
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,432
-DEENA: Whoa! Here's some light.
-Yeah.

448
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,897
DEENA:<i> And when it</i>
<i>gets dark in the Amazon,</i>

449
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,400
<i>it's not like</i>
<i>dark in the city.</i>

450
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,153
It's you can't see
where you're going.

451
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,572
<i>You can't see in front of you.</i>

452
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,073
<i>So our fire is our life.</i>

453
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,241
<i>And...</i>

454
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,410
<i>half of the tribe went nutty.</i>

455
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,537
(thunder crashing)

456
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,417
JOANNA: What the Devil meant for
evil, God done turned into good.

457
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,420
They tried to take our roof,
and we're still dry.

458
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,213
The rain just stopped.

459
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,757
JOANNA:
Thank you, Lord. Cover us.

460
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,093
Get that idol gone, put him
out there somewhere tomorrow.

461
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,386
-(laughing)
-I'm serious.

462
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,512
I'm not touching it.

463
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,931
DEENA:<i> Joanna doesn't</i>
<i>like the immunity idol</i>

464
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,391
<i>because she thinks</i>
<i>that it is an idol,</i>

465
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,602
<i>and idols are...</i>

466
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,437
<i>forbidden via</i>
<i>the Ten Commandments, right?</i>

467
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,606
<i>"Thou shalt have</i>
<i>no other gods before me."</i>

468
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,066
<i>She didn't want it</i>
<i>in the camp at all.</i>

469
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,610
<i>She didn't want to touch it,</i>
<i>she doesn't want to hold it.</i>

470
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,903
She wants nothing to do with it.

471
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,195
(thunder crashing)

472
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,116
JEANNE: Why can't you look at it
as a symbol instead of an idol?

473
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,744
JOANNA: Because it's not-- it's
called an idol for a reason.

474
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,954
-Well, why don't you change
the name? -It's almost like...

475
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,706
-No, I can't do that.
-But it meant...

476
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,957
it meant that we were unified
and we...

477
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,126
JOANNA:
No, you don't understand.

478
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,461
<i>You know,</i>
<i>some people worship Buddha,</i>

479
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,503
<i>and some people do that</i>
<i>or whatever.</i>

480
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,757
<i>I worship the most high</i>
<i>El Elyon God,</i>

481
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,967
<i>Jehovah Jireh,</i>
<i>El Shaddai, and he</i>

482
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,135
despises idol worship.

483
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:23,013
You... if you read the Old
Testament, they got struck down,

484
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,307
and that's why we
got rained on last night,

485
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,851
bringing the idol
into our... our tribe.

486
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,437
That idol is the reason
why we're all here right now.

487
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,813
JOANNA: That idol's not
the reason we're here.

488
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,482
We won before
we even had the idol.

489
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,317
As soon as we lose,
we lose the idol,

490
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,652
so if that idol is our friend,

491
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,612
why isn't he with us
when we were doing bad?

492
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,489
-(thunder crashes)
-I'm gonna talk

493
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,159
(laughs): all night long
about the goodness of the Lord

494
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,661
and the land of the living.

495
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,330
-DEENA: Couldn't you do it
in a whisper? -No.

496
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,457
-I haven't been to sleep yet.
-(laughing)

00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,846
CHRISTY:
So, that's the disadvantage

499
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,515
of me being deaf
at night, right?

500
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,141
-Yup.
-'Cause I miss out on that.

00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,147
<i>and I can't hear,</i>

504
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,525
so I'm totally like...
(blows raspberry)

505
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,360
out of the group.

506
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,987
Well, that's why
I talked to you yesterday.

507
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,196
You're missing a lot of the...

508
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,156
-The inter... -Right, and then
that just makes me think,

509
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,659
it's like, so maybe I am
really at a disadvantage,

510
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,536
-because... you know?
-You definitely are,

511
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,870
'cause you can't... yeah.

512
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,415
JEANNE:
<i>Christy had asked me</i>

513
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,543
what we talk about at night,
and if I could fill her in,

514
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,713
<i>so I said, "You know what,</i>
<i>I just want to let you know</i>

515
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,882
<i>"that Joanna is not excited</i>
<i>about the idol like we are,</i>

516
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>so just wanted</i>
<i>to let you know."</i>

517
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,553
And she goes,
"Well, that's stupid."

518
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,430
<i>Then Joanna walked by, and...</i>

519
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,723
<i>it just was a...</i>

520
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,850
<i>dog-eat-dog situation.</i>

521
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,268
-You are going around
telling people. -I...

522
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,561
-That's not right.
-I said it is your opinion.

523
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,813
You didn't say it like that--
you said, "That's your opinion!"

524
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,356
No, I didn't mean it that way.
I honestly, I didn't mean it...

525
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,025
But why are you insulted?
Why are you so insulted?

526
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,234
I'm not going around
telling people about

527
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,028
you getting up in
my face saying it, am I?

528
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,363
Don't interject
in my conversation negatively,

529
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,198
because I'm gonna
shut you down with my hand.

530
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,409
-Okay, okay, so now I know.
-You're gonna get the hand.

531
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,077
-Choose somebody else. -Hey,
hey, excuse me, we both made

532
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,579
a mistake. I said that, you put
a hand in my face...

533
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,080
But my mistake came
after your mistake.

534
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,540
CHRISTY:
<i>I don't know, she flipped out,</i>

535
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,751
and she just put
the hand to my face.

536
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,086
And when somebody
puts a hand in my face,

537
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,379
that really pissed me off,

538
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,256
<i>because I'm standing</i>
<i>right there.</i>

539
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,925
Man, if you are
a "vessel of Christ,"

540
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,263
don't you think you need to be a
little nicer or a little kinder?

541
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,473
-I say, "Get out of my face..."
-I mean, how would that feel

542
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,599
-if I put that in your face?
-But I wouldn't... I didn't

543
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,559
do anything for you to do that.
I didn't come over here

544
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,394
and do anything for you to go...
I didn't jump

545
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,104
-in your conversation. -Well,
obviously, I charged on over

546
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,856
-here to try to, like, you know?
-To let you know.

547
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,608
I mean, is it okay for me to
express my feelings

548
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,485
-with somebody? -But I thought
you said you wanted to find

549
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,278
a way to let it go.
If you're still expressing

550
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,404
your feelings, that means
it's not squashed.

551
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,615
Well, I'm-I'm hurt, so I'm
trying to get it out so I

552
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,283
-can feel better. -You won't be
hurt anymore if you don't

553
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,952
come up into my face saying
things that you say, okay?

554
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,996
JOANNA:<i> It wasn't</i>
<i>that I went over there to...</i>

555
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,582
<i>dog her out anymore, but I</i>
<i>wanted her to know, don't think</i>

556
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,793
you're gonna around the tribe
talking trash about me

557
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,503
because you got up
in my business.

558
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,796
-That's your way of doing it.
-Leave me alone.

559
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,839
-Okay. Okay.
-And get out of my face.

560
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,470
JANET:
I know.

561
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,931
-I know.
-(Christy sighs)

562
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,016
(whispering): I'm not
gonna let this bother me.

563
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,394
I'm not gonna
let this bother me.

564
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,106
(exhales)

565
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,821
(birds chirping)

566
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,375
-Hang up everyone's bags.
-Yeah.

567
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,336
Should we? 'Cause, then, what
if it rains when we're gone?

568
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,005
Well...

569
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,549
What is that?

570
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,176
-Do you guys see what I see?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

571
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,886
Whose is that?

572
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,847
Whose wrapper is that?
Because that is not fair.

573
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,014
HEIDI:
There's something in there

574
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,599
-that shouldn't be in there.
-What?

575
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,725
Take a look.

576
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,269
I don't know whose it is.

577
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,396
JANET:
Oh, the food thing.

578
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,566
-Is that what you guys mean?
-Yeah. Where'd it come from?

579
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,401
Well, heck, I don't know.

580
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,987
JENNA:<i> We put all</i>
<i>of our stuff in the box,</i>

581
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,531
<i>and we covered it up</i>
<i>'cause it was gonna rain,</i>

582
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,324
<i>and we took all the packs out</i>

583
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,909
and at the bottom
there's a granola bar.

584
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,996
It was a wrapper-- I had
no idea if it was empty or not.

585
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,914
-(several talking) -I think that
somebody smuggled it.

586
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,666
-Somebody just needs to fess up.
-Yeah, really.

587
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,876
JANET:
Well, it sure... it was not me.

588
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,503
-Uh, it's not me. -But is there
something still in there?

589
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,546
-Yeah.
-JOANNA: Okay, I so

590
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,214
do not think anybody
would be out here starving

591
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,757
and know they have that
and not eat it.

592
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,218
Well, I would like someone
to pick it up with a stick

593
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,469
and throw it in the fire.

594
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,388
JENNA:<i> First it was, like,</i>
<i>immediate anger, like,</i>

595
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,556
who brought this?

596
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,099
You're not allowed
to bring this.

597
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,559
It's food. We're starving.

598
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,603
You have no right
to eat over us.

599
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,855
We all agree, right?
We're killing it?

600
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,607
OTHERS:
-Jaburu. -Yeah.

601
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,734
JOANNA: We're hungry, but we're
gonna throw it away.

602
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,236
'Cause if we didn't hunt it
or kill it or catch it,

603
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,571
we don't eat it.

604
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,780
Jaburu rules.

605
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,073
That's, like, so depressing.

606
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,826
-Hey, we're all here to play the
game the fair way. -So stupid.

607
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,703
-And starving is a part of it.
-I agree.

608
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,580
HEIDI:<i> We ultimately</i>
<i>burned it in the fire,</i>

609
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,748
because it was
definitely not fair.

610
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,417
The guys didn't have one;
we should not have had one.

611
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,586
I don't really want
to accuse anyone, but...

612
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,088
-DEENA: I know, but I need to
know what you know. -I agree.

613
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,757
I want to sit everybody down
and cross-examine

614
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,259
your sorry butts
and find out exactly who it was.

615
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,929
DEENA:<i> Everybody is</i>
<i>adamantly denying it,</i>

616
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,931
<i>then it sets off</i>
<i>the whole inquisition party,</i>

617
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,266
<i>and, of course, I want to know</i>
<i>who took the candy bar.</i>

618
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,101
Jeanne saw

619
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,229
the little candy bar thing
inside of Janet's bag,

620
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,814
and Jeanne doesn't want
to just let it go.

621
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,566
She wants to give Janet

622
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,319
an opportunity to either
say that it was her candy bar

623
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,780
-or deny it. -I think even
if she doesn't confess,

624
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,782
I'll still think it's her,
you know what I mean?

625
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,908
-I think so, too.
-Exactly.

626
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,451
JEANNE:
<i>The reason why</i>

627
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,787
<i>finding the granola bar</i>
<i>in our little chest</i>

628
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,456
<i>upset me is because,</i>
<i>you know, we came out here</i>

629
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,791
to play a game, play fair.

630
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,501
We knew we weren't
gonna get any food,

631
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,254
and, uh...
I don't like cheaters.

632
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,319
ALEX:
Let's see what we got.

633
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,156
MATTHEW:<i> The fact that</i>
<i>we were kind of gloating</i>

634
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,368
<i>before the initial</i>
<i>immunity challenge</i>

635
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,537
made us look
even worse when we lost it.

636
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,331
Hey, fellas, we got mail.

637
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,624
MATTHEW:<i> When it happened</i>
<i>the second time,</i>

638
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,792
<i>people started to realize,</i>

639
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,004
<i>this could become</i>
<i>a very disturbing trend.</i>

640
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,630
-"What will you remember?
-Uh-oh.

641
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,507
"For immunity, absorb it all.

642
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,175
"The only things that matter

643
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,011
are things you can recall."

644
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,014
ALEX:<i> This immunity is</i>
<i>really important for our tribe.</i>

645
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,557
<i>It feels a little</i>
<i>do-or-die right now,</i>

646
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,309
<i>just 'cause we've lost two.</i>

647
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,562
You know, if we drop
three in a row... that's bad.

648
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,161
PROBST:
Welcome, guys.

649
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,495
First things first.

650
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,081
Christy.

651
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,584
Immunity, back up for grabs.

652
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,627
All right,
in a survival situation,

653
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,504
your awareness
of your surroundings,

654
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,090
and the retention of that
information is critical.

655
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,217
Today's immunity challenge
is gonna test just that:

656
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,053
your observational skills

657
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,888
and your retention
of that information.

658
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,390
I'm gonna give you
two minutes to explore

659
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,892
<i>an Amazonian Indian village.</i>

660
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,894
<i>I'm gonna ask you</i>
<i>a series of questions</i>

661
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,937
<i>based on your observations.</i>

662
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,397
Jaburu, because you
have one extra member,

663
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,857
you're sitting somebody out--
can't be Christy.

664
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,692
You can't sit out
the same person

665
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,860
in back-to-back challenges.
Who's sitting out?

666
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,404
Shawna.
Take a seat on the bench.

667
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,865
The rest of the tribes, you
have two minutes. Go explore.

668
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,284
There's an upstairs
and a downstairs--

669
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,869
check them both out.

670
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,579
Make sure you check out

671
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,915
the back areas, too.

672
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,876
ALEX:
This looks like corn.

673
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,087
-What's this stuff?
-DAVE: This is manioc.

674
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,214
The stove is made out of mud.

675
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,423
Yeah.

676
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,092
This is manioc?

677
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,218
30 seconds, tribes.

678
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,928
DAVE:
What are these?

679
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,763
Yeah, not really.

680
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,972
PROBST:
All right, guys,

681
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,140
that's it-- head in.

682
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,942
I'm gonna ask you guys
ten questions.

683
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,736
Tribe who gets
the most right out of ten

684
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,906
wins immunity--
three more days in the Amazon.

685
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,991
For the losing tribe,
Tribal Council--

686
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,410
somebody going home.

687
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,912
You cannot look
to your tribe mates for help,

688
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,831
don't look backwards
at any time.

689
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,416
First person, step up.

690
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,875
Jeanne, Dave.

691
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,795
-Come on.
-Question number one.

692
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,339
All right, if you've
been aware, the first one

693
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,632
should be easy.

694
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,009
"What are the colors
of the feathers

695
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,846
on the rattle that came
with your treemail?"

696
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,766
All right, reveal.
Hold them in front of you.

697
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,976
Dave says yellow.

698
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,811
Red and yellow. Close.

699
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,855
Red, yellow and green.

700
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,273
No score.

701
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,275
Set your pad down
and take a spot.

702
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,610
Next two. Deena, Rob,

703
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,487
question number two:
"How many rungs

704
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,699
<i>are on the outside ladder</i>
<i>leading upstairs?"</i>

705
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,660
Reveal.

706
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,078
Deena says eight.

707
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,455
Rob says six.

708
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,789
Correct answer...

709
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,832
six.

710
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,459
One for Tambaqui.

711
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,295
-Robasu!
-Robasu!

712
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,214
Tambaqui takes an early lead:
one, zero.

713
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,259
Christy, Butch,

714
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,553
"How many pigs are in the pen?"

715
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,721
Reveal.

716
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,306
Christy says 12.

717
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,182
Butch says nine.

718
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,850
Correct answer: nine.

719
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,185
Tambaqui, on the board again.

720
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:34,189
Tambaqui two, Jaburu zip.

721
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,692
Alex, Jenna, this is
question number four.

722
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,860
<i>"One of the small bowls</i>

723
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,445
"had something in it.

724
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,155
What was in the bowl?"

725
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,364
Cover your answers.

726
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,993
Reveal.

727
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,369
Jenna says nuts.

728
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,370
Alex says nuts.

729
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,371
Nuts'll work.

730
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,207
One point for both tribes.

731
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,542
Tambaqui three, Jaburu one.

732
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,544
Next two.

733
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,712
Question number five:

734
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:01,716
"What are the two items sitting
in the finished canoe?"

735
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,843
There are two items
in the finished canoe.

736
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,886
What are they?

737
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,929
Reveal.

738
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,223
Daniel says spear.

739
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,724
You say ax and hammer.
Neither are right.

740
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,352
It was a spear,
but also a coil of rope.

741
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,313
No score.
Tambaqui three, Jaburu one.

742
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,233
Heidi, Matthew,
here's question number six:

743
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,734
<i>"How many hammocks are there?"</i>

744
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,489
Reveal.

745
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,407
Heidi says two.
Matthew says two.

746
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,284
You're both right: two.

747
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,577
Tambaqui has four,

748
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,787
Jaburu has two.

749
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,080
Remember,

750
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,915
there are only ten questions.

751
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,584
Joanna, Roger,
question number seven:

752
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,419
<i>"How many manioc cakes</i>
<i>are in the frying pan?"</i>

753
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,422

754
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,341

Roger says nine.

756
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,470
You're right: nine.

757
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,305
-DAVE: Good going, Rog.
-ROB: All right.

758
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,392
PROBST: Tribe who gets the most
right out of ten wins immunity.

759
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,061
All right, guys,
we're at five-three, with

760
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,813
three questions left.
Because of the point difference,

761
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,773
Jaburu, you got
to get this right.

762
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,275
Question number eight:

763
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,318
<i>"There are two types</i>
<i>of fruit in the kitchen.</i>

764
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,778
What are they?"

765
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,947
Reveal.
Pineapple, banana.

766
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,449
You're both right.
Another point for both tribes.

767
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,994
Tambaqui, you have six.

768
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,161
Jaburu, you're at four.

769
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,830
Here's the deal, guys.

770
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,374
Two questions left. Deena,
if you don't get it right,

771
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:20,378
Jaburu can't catch up,
Tambaqui wins.

772
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,339
"In the trough,
there are many manioc roots.

773
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,341
How many of them are peeled?"

774
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:29,053
How many of
the manioc roots are peeled?

775
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,813
Reveal.

776
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,982
You say one.

777
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,317
You both say one.

778
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,818
You're both wrong; it was four.

779
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,321
Jaburu, because
you didn't get that right,

780
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,363
the contest is over.

781
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,823
Tambaqui, immunity.

782
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,658
-(cheering, whooping)
-Yeah!

783
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,995
(excited shouts)

784
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,332
Tambaqui, congratulations--
no Tribal Council date tonight.

785
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,583
I know you like that.

786
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,961
Jaburu, I'm sorry to say, I will
be seeing you at Tribal Council,

787
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,379
including Shawna.
You have a few hours

788
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,922
to think about what's
gonna happen tonight.

789
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,841
I'll see you there.
You can head back to camp.

790
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,510
MEN:
Tambaqui!

791
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,404
(rhythmic chopping)

792
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,546
CHRISTY: I need a volunteer
to help me put this up

793
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,881
so we can build a shelter.

794
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,008
Okay,

795
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,052
help me put up one side.

796
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,055
'Cause I want a shelter.

797
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,224
It took me, what, two hours?

798
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,226
CHRISTY:
<i>I think my tribe</i>

799
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,811
<i>is the most laziest tribe,</i>

800
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,480
the most laziest group
I've ever been involved with.

801
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,233
And it's, like,
what do they expect out here?

802
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,859
<i>What do they...</i>
<i>I mean, some people are</i>

803
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,945
<i>just slacking</i>
<i>and lying around, and...</i>

804
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,280
and it pisses me off.

805
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,741
CHRISTY:
I want the shelter so bad.

806
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,453
Then I can just sit and chill
like you guys.

807
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,748
DEENA:<i> I took a break</i>
<i>from cutting down palm trees</i>

808
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,750
so that I could sleep
on the bed,

809
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,086
and Christy went off

810
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,921
<i>on Jenna and Heidi</i>
<i>and Shawna and I.</i>

811
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:28,464
<i>That set me off a little bit.</i>

812
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,924
<i>I didn't say anything to her,</i>

813
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:30,758
'cause it's not worth my time

814
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,427
or my effort,
so I just walked away.

CHRISTY:
What?

824
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,943
DEENA:
Build away.

825
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,445
CHRISTY:
I don't want to build.

826
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,447
-I want to go fishing.
-JOANNA: See? See?

827
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,407
-See what I'm talking about?
-I don't know,

828
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,117
I did that part.
I didn't get any help.

829
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,618
I don't feel
like doing it today.

830
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,789
CHRISTY:<i> I gave up</i>
<i>on working with the tribe.</i>

831
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,915
<i>I feel totally</i>

832
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,002
<i>excluded from the tribe,</i>
<i>and so I realize</i>

833
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,462
<i>I'm automatically rejected.</i>

834
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,922
<i>I mean, Jenna hasn't even said</i>

835
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,092
a word to me
this whole five days.

836
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,971
My pole is in the boat,
and the bait is right there.

837
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,931
The small knife is over there.

838
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,477
But I need somebody to go,
so I'll wait, whenever...

839
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,437
somebody wants to go.

840
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,314
It's okay, if you guys,
if this is your priority

841
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,815
I'll join you guys,
I'll help you guys.

842
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,484
I'd like it if all of us do it.

843
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,154
But I do not want to be
the only one building it, so...

844
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,991
Believe me, no one's shirkin',
everyone's workin'.

845
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:40,828
DEENA:<i> If Christy gets voted out</i>
<i>tonight, it's gonna be because</i>

846
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,497
<i>of her personality</i>
<i>and her attitude, not anything</i>

847
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,832
to do with her handicap
or her disability.

848
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,335
JANET:
That "Y" is dead wood.

849
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,544
-CHRISTY: No, it's not.
-It isn't?

850
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,670
It's not. I swear to God,

851
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,964
-I tried it. It'll hold on.
-So it's sturdy enough?

852
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,508
-It worked fine.
-All right.

853
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,301
JANET:<i> Who I think</i>
<i>will go tonight will</i>

854
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,677
either be me or Christy.

855
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,680
I... can't really know

856
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,058
until that moment
which of us will go.

857
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,185
They're probably
deciding that now.

858
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,145
Is everybody here?
I want to say something,

859
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,522
if everybody's here.

860
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,190
You know, it's gotten around

861
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,736
that I'm the one that
brought the... granola bar,

862
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,988
candy bar, whatever it was.

863
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,990
I don't know
who smuggled it in...

864
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,492
but it wasn't me.

865
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,369
So if you're gonna
vote me out, that's fine,

866
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,037
as long as it's
not for that reason.

867
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,206
Because if it is,
you're making a mistake.

868
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,670
JANET:<i> Strategically, I probably</i>
<i>should vote for Christy,</i>

869
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,421
<i>but I think, instead,</i>
<i>I will vote</i>

870
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,132
<i>for Jeanne,</i>
<i>because Jeanne is the one</i>

871
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,092
that stirred up all of this,
she's the one that

872
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,385
<i>first brought it up</i>
<i>and then went</i>

873
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,512
<i>around to people and said,</i>
<i>you know, "I think Janet</i>

874
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,555
smuggled in food."

875
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,391
I mean, she really basically
stirred it all up.

876
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,649
(thunder rolling)

877
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,750
PROBST:
Behind each of you guys

878
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,252
is a torch
in your tribe color.

879
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,588
Grab a torch,

880
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,757
approach a flame,
dip it and get fire.

881
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,760
This is part of
the ritual of Tribal Council,

882
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,763
because at Tribal Council,
fire represents life.

883
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,224
As long as you have fire,
you're in the game.

884
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,767
When your fire's out,
so are you.

885
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,644
And then put the torches
back in their slots

886
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,146
and have a seat.

887
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,486
So, let's talk
about the first six days.

888
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,281
Who's emerging right now, Janet?

889
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,367
Is there somebody you look to
for certain things?

890
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,328
Or maybe somebody else
for other skills?

891
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,831
Well, Joanna's an
extremely strong woman,

892
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,627
incredible strength, and we
really, really relied on her,

893
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,337
and Deena both,
I, you know, I think

894
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,798
really... did
an incredible amount of chopping

895
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,301
and, you know,
just the really heavy labor,

896
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,428
because they're just
really strong women.

897
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,722
Deena, you guys
have certain things

898
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,474
you have to accomplish
at a camp.

899
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,433
You got to build shelter,

900
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,477
you got to get fire,
you got to find water.

901
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,646
Take me through the shelter.

902
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,147
We have none.

903
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,483
It's... sort of completed.

904
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,984
But it's not really a shelter,

905
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,821
it's kind of a mishmosh
of hodgepodge of... of a mess.

906
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,615
You have to factor in
the elements.

907
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,492
We have a lot of downpours here,

908
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:28,287
and then there is the traipsing
out to find the right materials.

909
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,498
JOANNA: We can't say, oh,
we're just gonna take all day

910
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,500
and build a shelter
and we don't have any water.

911
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,002
We can't say we're gonna take
all day and build a shelter and

912
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,295
we don't have a fire
to boil the water,

913
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,839
'cause if we can't have a fire,
we can't boil water to drink.

914
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,091
And then we're gonna die.

915
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,509
PROBST:
What I'm getting at is,

916
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,011
it doesn't sound
like you have<i> any</i> plan.

917
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,514
Christy, is there anything

918
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,517
that's not being done at camp
that you could do better?

919
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,687
The shelter.
The shelter.

920
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,606
I think the shelter should
have been built days ago.

921
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,567
-Joanna, you're shaking your
head no, no, no. -No, because

922
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,152
after we came back
with the palm fronds,

923
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,154
somebody asked her about
completing the shelter, and she

924
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,532
-was, like, "No, I wanna go
fishing." -Well, that was today,

925
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,033
because I work hard,
there are people

926
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,660
sitting down, doing nothing,

927
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,704
and here I am, trying
to put a shelter together

928
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,372
and I get no help, no support.

929
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,207
I asked questions,
I got no answer.

930
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,044
So I felt very, like,
so you want me to help you now?

931
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,213
PROBST:
Do you feel excluded?

932
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,048
-Yes.
-Do you think

933
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,216
it has to do with

934
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,051
-that you're deaf?
-Yes.

935
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,052
No question?

936
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,554
(choked up):
No question.

937
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,222
PROBST:
What's a sign of that?

938
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,558
When...

939
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,685
there's something
important going on,

940
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,062
I'm not... I have
no idea what's going on.

941
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,732
I don't know when
I need to join the group.

942
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,734
I... um, every time I'm there,
people just...

943
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:44,572
move away, or they just...
they don't include me.

944
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,241
I work harder than them,

945
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,744
and I don't feel
like they're working...

946
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,748
And it just makes it harder when
your team doesn't accept you.

947
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,249
PROBST:
Janet, body language is

948
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,168
-telling me everything.
-I-I just find it

949
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,379
insulting for someone
to say that we sit around.

950
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,382
Let me ask you, then--
what do you think about

951
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,928
the notion that Christy
is being excluded on purpose?

952
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,263
I think that's also ridiculous.

953
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:12,308
It's not...
we don't exclude anybody.

954
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,727
We're women living together
in the jungle,

955
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,229
trying to survive
without food and water.

956
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,858
So eventually,
reactions are gonna happen.

957
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,986
It is time to vote.

958
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,905
Heidi, you're up.

959
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,459
Janet, I'm voting for you,

960
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,795
because I know
you want out of here.

961
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,923
<i>You were sick at first, and</i>
<i>it's really hard to catch up.</i>

962
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,145
I understand
we need physical strength,

963
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,272
but your attitude stinks.

964
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,090
My vote is for Jeanne.

965
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,843
You've got incredible strength,

966
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,471
<i>you're just nonstop,</i>
<i>but you're just too aggressive.</i>

967
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,871
I'll go tally the votes.

968
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,213
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

969
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,340
The person voted
out'll be asked to leave

970
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,717
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

971
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,677
I'll read the votes.

972
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,391
First vote...

973
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,185
Jenna.

974
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,523
Janet.

975
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,864
Christy.

976
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,159
Jeanne.

977
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,536
That's one vote Jeanne,
one vote Janet,

978
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,914
one vote Christy,
one vote Jenna.

979
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:45,920
Janet.

980
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,048
Two votes Janet.

981
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,051
Three votes Janet.

982
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,100
First person
voted out of Jaburu...

983
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,936
Janet. That's four,
and that's enough.

984
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,812
The last vote
will remain a mystery.

985
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,147
You need to bring me your torch.

986
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,660
Janet, the tribe has spoken.

987
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,706
It's time for you to go.

988
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,874
Good luck, guys.

989
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,677
I hope tomorrow morning brings

990
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,680
some much needed change
to this tribe.

991
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,640
Good night.
Head back to camp.

992
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,904
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

993
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,870
PROBST:<i> Next time on</i> Survivor,
<i>Jaburu can't get it together.</i>

994
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,832
JEANNE:<i> The hygiene of the camp</i>
<i>right now is lacking,</i>

995
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,000
<i>and our tribe is pretty much</i>

996
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,084
pathetic.

997
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,211
PROBST:<i> But can they</i>
<i>get cleaned up in time</i>

998
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,338
<i>for their big date</i>
<i>with Tambaqui?</i>

999
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,257
-It's sort of a mixer, if you
will. -But you should hear

1000
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,883
what we say about him
at our camp; it's all good.

1001
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,969
Yeah, Rob!

1002
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,095
Sweet.

1003
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,145
Well, guys, it was an amazing...
an amazing week.

1004
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,688
<i>I found out I am not</i>

1005
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,064
