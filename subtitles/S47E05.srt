1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,676
<i>I was the murderer, and now I'm trying</i>

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,676
to cover my tracks.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,830
I'm gonna kill Jeff.

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,506
<i>Previously on survivor</i>

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,626
I don't think Andy's gonna be loyal to me.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,076
Why?

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,876
<i>Sam wants to work with Andy, but</i>

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,806
<i>I want to stick with the three girls.</i>

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,176
<i>We're just bickering like a friggin' old</i>

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,270
married couple.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,506
Yeah.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,946
<i>Gabe's gonna want me to flip on tiyana,</i>

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,476
<i>and there's no way in
hell that I'm gonna try</i>

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,700
<i>to go after her.</i>

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,076
<i>We can agree to play
these amulets together,</i>

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,346
<i>and they would have the effect</i>

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,630
of a hidden immunity idol.

18
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,530
Yeah.

19
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,000
<i>I don't want to just be
going along with plans.</i>

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,606
<i>So maybe it's time to stop
going along with kishan's plan</i>

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,946
and make kishan the plan.

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,230
Kishan, the tribe has spoken.

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,946
<i>I feel like I don't even
know what happened tonight.</i>

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,706
I've been bamboozled.

25
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,806
I've been betrayed, I've been humbled.

26
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,346
<i>Walking into tribal, I was
expecting the vote to be Rome.</i>

27
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,446
But in one fell swoop,

28
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,806
I've been blindsided and I've lost kishan,

29
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,906
who I consider to be my number one,

30
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,930
end-all, be-all in this
game above anybody else.

31
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,446
A little bit.

32
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,846
I'll be all right.

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,806
Why? What's going on?

34
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,870
Teeny, did you know about the plan?

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,476
I did know about the plan.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,646
Is there a reason you
didn't tell me, though?

37
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,276
Because I didn't have a
vote or any way to control it.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,506
I thought you had my back, though.

39
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,506
I do, but, like...

40
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,506
How can you say that if you
know it's gonna be me tonight

41
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,746
and then you don't tell me?

42
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,006
<i>It's hard to say</i>

43
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,806
what this means for me moving forward.

44
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,576
You know, my first thought is, like,

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,676
<i>"how close was it to being me?</i>

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,106
<i>"How far on the bottom am I?</i>

47
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,006
Can I crawl back up?"

48
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,776
I really don't know.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,206
Like, can you be straight-up with me?

50
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,600
Was there a debate? Like...

51
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,900
No. No. No. No.

52
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,576
- I feel that no matter...
- You are right in the middle.

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,906
You're not at the bottom.

54
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,246
Rome and sol are on the bottom.

55
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,576
You and me are in the middle,

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,876
because they both want to work with us,

57
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,106
and they don't want
to work with each other.

58
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,490
Rome doesn't want to work with me.

59
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,346
<i>The idea to vote out kishan was mine,</i>

60
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,346
<i>and I knew I had to vote him out.</i>

61
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,936
<i>It was better for my game.</i>

62
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,806
He is the player that is the threat

63
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,246
that you don't see until it's too late.

64
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,806
<i>And I just couldn't take that chance.</i>

65
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,000
Like...

66
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,776
He's pissed off at you
tonight. He's gonna be...

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,936
Well, what do I say to him, dude?

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,446
Because I didn't come up with that plan.

69
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,846
- No.
- I was told the plan.

70
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,246
I was also told the plan.

71
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,446
<i>At this point, I feel good</i>

72
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,976
<i>that I've done the damage
control I need to do with teeny.</i>

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,606
And now I have Rome,
who really trusts me,

74
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,936
because I tipped him off

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,476
and saved him from going home tonight.

76
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,600
So, I think I'm in a good position.

77
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,246
Like, from the bottom of my heart, okay?

78
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,960
But I want you to know I
feel freed from the shackles

79
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,106
of, like, kishan being
a person in this game

80
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,836
that I have to, like, make decisions with

81
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,676
or be associated with.

82
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,546
I do feel liberated.

83
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,876
And, I mean, I do, too, because, like,

84
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,346
you know, when I came into this game,

85
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,106
I said that I wanted to get an alliance,

86
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,000
and I want to do everything possible

87
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,106
to get that alliance as far as possible.

88
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,776
And so that's why tonight,

89
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,506
I was more hurt by kishan than anything.

90
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,546
<i>I thought that I had a
solid alliance with me,</i>

91
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,506
<i>Genevieve, kishan and teeny.</i>

92
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,476
<i>So, the second that I heard
kishan put my name out there,</i>

93
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,476
I knew that that trust with me
and kishan was out the window,

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,876
was sayonara, goodbye.

95
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,446
<i>And that's why I had
absolutely zero problems</i>

96
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,346
stealing his vote tonight,
writing his name down twice

97
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,900
and seeing him get his torch snuffed.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,346
<i>I feel like teeny most definitely feels like</i>

99
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,836
<i>she's on the bottom right now,</i>

100
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,606
<i>and that's exactly how I want her to feel.</i>

101
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,646
So, yes, teeny, you can be remorseful.

102
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,960
You can be, you know,

103
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,776
<i>sad that you were left out of the vote,</i>

104
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,346
<i>but at the end of the day,</i>

105
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,570
that trust is 100% broken.

106
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Come on in!

107
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,300
Wow.

108
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,506
Tuku, gata, getting your first look

109
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,576
at the new lavo tribe.

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,206
Kishan voted out at the last tribal council.

111
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,000
Wow, man.

112
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,306
All right, day nine, survivor 47.

113
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,606
Let's get to today's reward challenge.

114
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,106
There are only two
lanes for today's challenge

115
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,546
because we're doing something different.

116
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,976
- Man.
- I know.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,676
Brand-new survivor twist.

118
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,106
My gosh.

119
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,476
There are only two
lanes for today's challenge

120
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,100
because we're doing something different.

121
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,546
My god.

122
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,506
Holy cow.

123
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,006
Here's how it works. We're
gonna do a random draw

124
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,006
across all three tribes - wow.

125
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,976
And form two teams of seven.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,776
These are teams just for this challenge.

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,836
- Wow.
- You will

128
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,906
compete together, and if you win, you will

129
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,960
celebrate together with the reward.

130
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,306
- Wow.
- Wow.

131
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,106
- Wow.
- All right, before

132
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,706
we get to the draw, let me
walk you through the challenge.

133
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,346
<i>For today's challenge, you're gonna</i>

134
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,576
<i>race under an obstacle,
collecting keys along the way.</i>

135
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,306
<i>You'll use those keys to unlock a ladder.</i>

136
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,376
<i>You'll then work together
to maneuver the ladder</i>

137
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,276
<i>until it's free.</i>

138
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,976
<i>You'll use the ladder to collect five balls</i>

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,446
<i>from an overhead structure.</i>

140
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,006
<i>Race to the finish, where you will attempt</i>

141
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,370
<i>to land those balls into
five different targets.</i>

142
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,406
First team of seven
to finish wins reward.

143
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,376
Want to know what you're playing for?

144
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,876
The winning seven will be

145
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,736
- taken to the sanctuary...
- Are you kidding me?

146
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,736
Where good things happen

147
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,606
for a brand-new survivor reward.

148
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,106
It's called the survivor social hour.

149
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,676
Here's how it works. You're
gonna barbecue hot dogs.

150
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,936
- What?! You're kidding.
- My gosh.-!

151
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,430
Play a little survivor cornhole.

152
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,536
And you will also have

153
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,506
the advantage of opportunity.

154
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,736
The opportunity to hang out
with players you don't know

155
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,576
and maybe forge bonds that
will help you later in the game.

156
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,476
Losers, I got nothing for you.

157
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,806
You will head back to
your camp and then hope

158
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,506
that somebody will share
with you what really went down.

159
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,476
Worth playing for?

160
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,736
All right, then. Let's draw for teams.

161
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,106
<i>This reward is something
totally unprecedented,</i>

162
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,506
<i>and the biggest advantage of it is</i>

163
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,806
<i>you're getting this opportunity to really</i>

164
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,300
cross-pollinate and mingle
with the other two tribes.

165
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,246
If you are blue, go to the blue mat.

166
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,876
If you're yellow, go to the yellow mat.

167
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,106
<i>So, it's huge strategically,</i>

168
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,876
<i>because we know how
close we are to the merge.</i>

169
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,806
<i>And any time you can get with people</i>

170
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,536
<i>who you're not very
familiar with right now</i>

171
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,376
is gonna be invaluable.

172
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,776
All right, so let's look at
these temporary teams.

173
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,736
For today only, we
have Anika, sol, Rome,

174
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,576
Gabe, Andy, Sierra and Genevieve.

175
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,276
Over here in yellow,

176
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,346
we have sue, Kyle, teeny, Sam, Rachel,

177
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,836
tiyana and Caroline.

178
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,906
So, both groups have
members from all three tribes,

179
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,276
which means, if you win,
this will truly be an advantage

180
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,776
because, for the first time,

181
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,706
you will have a sense of
what's going on everywhere.

182
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,036
- Wow.
- Wow.

183
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,906
All right, give you a minute to strategize.

184
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,100
We'll get it on. Let's do this!

185
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,976
All right, here we go. For
reward at the sanctuary.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,400
Survivors ready?

187
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,576
Go! First you got to
get under that obstacle,

188
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,306
and you are untying bags.

189
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,176
Every player is responsible for one bag.

190
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,276
You cannot grab more than one.

191
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,976
Once you have a bag, get to your mat.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,660
Once everybody's at
your mat, you can move on.

193
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,376
- Y'all got this!
- Good job, team.

194
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,776
Everybody funneling out
quickly. Got to get all seven there.

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,676
Go, blue! You're good!

196
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,776
- Go, yellow! You're good.
- Come on, come on, come on. Go.

197
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,376
Now you're looking for three keys.

198
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,606
Once you have

199
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,806
all three keys, you can
try to unlock the ladder.

200
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,806
You're good, blue!

201
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,006
All right. Go, girl.

202
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,276
Yellow, you're good.

203
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,606
You're good.

204
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,376
You have to untie. You have to untie.

205
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,346
It is blue in the early lead.
Their ladder is unlocked.

206
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,376
Now you got to maneuver that ladder

207
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,106
through a tricky maze.

208
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,476
It looks a lot easier than it is.

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,806
Do you have the rest?

210
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,106
We got it.

211
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,500
Yellow has their ladder unlocked.

212
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,976
Yellow has some momentum now.

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,300
It is yellow in the lead.

214
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,936
Blue is stuck.

215
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,606
- That's it.
- There we go. There we go.

216
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,776
- Keep pushing a little bit more. Yeah.
- Yeah. Good job.

217
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,406
Yellow can feel it.

218
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,706
They have figured this out.

219
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,206
Good teamwork, guys.

220
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,706
Yellow has the ladder
free. You can move on.

221
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,376
- Right here.
- It is yellow now in the lead.

222
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,606
- Down. All right.
- Okay.

223
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,960
One person going up.

224
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,906
It's gonna be Kyle going up the ladder.

225
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,806
- Unclip.
- It's so steady.

226
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,106
There's one.

227
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,806
There's two. Kyle can reach three.

228
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,476
- Down he goes.
- Now you got to make

229
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,106
just one move to get the other two.

230
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,636
Blue still working on
freeing up their ladder.

231
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,506
Lift up, Rome. There you go.

232
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,936
Yellow now increasing their lead.

233
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,106
Kyle quickly unclips those balls.

234
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,476
- Can we drop it?
- Drop it.

235
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,206
Do that, do that, do that.

236
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,000
That's how you do it on survivor.

237
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,006
Drop one in every slot.

238
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,336
You got two rebounders
up here. Let's go!

239
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,876
It's gonna be teeny taking
the first spot for yellow.

240
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,006
- Just shoot. You're okay.
- Rachel and sue gonna rebound.

241
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,936
Wow.

242
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,000
- Just misses.
- Nice, guys. Good work.

243
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,506
Blue has their ladder free.

244
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,700
- You're good, blue!
- They're still on their first.

245
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,106
Get it up and get one
person up the ladder.

246
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,706
- Okay, everyone, stabilize.
- All day, Rome, all day.

247
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,960
- Stabilize!
- It's gonna be Rome going up.

248
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,960
You're unclipping, Rome.

249
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,706
- Soft touch.
- Yay!

250
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,306
There you go.

251
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,806
Teeny scores the first basket for yellow.

252
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,436
Caroline now taking her spot.

253
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,106
- Hold up. Hold it tight.
- Rome taking a lot

254
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,630
of time on that second bag.

255
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,106
Nice, Rome!

256
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,246
Kyle whipped through it.
There's Rome with the third.

257
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,306
- And a big leap.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

258
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,536
Now it's Gabe going up.

259
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,246
- Go, move.
- Go. Okay.

260
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,306
- Still got me?
- Yes, yes, it's stabilized.

261
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,106
They're gonna swap out.

262
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,106
Yellow has one.

263
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,776
Caroline going for two. Just misses.

264
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,106
Gabe working for that final bag.

265
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,806
Unclip it. He's got it.

266
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,500
Drop the ladder, and you're good.

267
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,960
Get all your bags in.

268
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,960
- Go! Go! Go!
- In the hole, in the hole, in the hole.

269
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,106
Okay, there it is. That's it.

270
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,606
Caroline scores the second for yellow!

271
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,736
Here comes tiyana.

272
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,606
Gabe gonna take the first shot for blue.

273
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,106
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

274
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,576
Gabe scores the first for blue!

275
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,976
We've got yellow with two, blue with one.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,276
- You got this, tiyana.
- There goes tiyana

277
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,506
- with a huge toss.
- Yeah. Yup. Yup.

278
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,976
Just out.

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,106
One more.

280
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,730
There goes Sierra.

281
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,106
- Ooh, get in there!
- Yes!

282
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,206
Sierra scores a second for blue.

283
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,576
We are tied, two-two.

284
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,906
You got it, tiyana. Come on.

285
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,706
Tiyana, deep breath.

286
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,936
- Nice launch. That looks good.
- Yes. Yes!

287
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
There it is! Yellow has their third.

288
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,236
Here comes Kyle with the fourth.

289
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,636
Andy going short.

290
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,636
- In and out.
- God.

291
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,000
Here goes Kyle.

292
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,436
Yeah!

293
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,006
Kyle with a huge toss.

294
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,206
Scores it. That is the fourth for yellow.

295
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,560
It is now Sam with the
fifth and final ball for yellow.

296
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,236
- Andy scores the third.
- Good work, Andy!

297
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,336
Here comes sol now working
on that fourth ball for blue.

298
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,876
Sam's way back. It's a long ways away.

299
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,660
Takes a lot of touch and a lot of strength.

300
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,676
Can Sam close it out
for yellow? In and out.

301
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,606
Sol trying to tie it up for
blue to give them a shot.

302
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,800
- In and out.
- So close, sol.

303
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,006
There goes Sam for the win.

304
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,906
Is that it? It is!

305
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,106
Yellow wins reward!

306
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,106
Rachel, sue, Caroline, tiyana,

307
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,336
teeny, Sam, and Kyle

308
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,376
earn an afternoon at the sanctuary.

309
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,706
- My god.
- Wow.

310
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,630
Huge effort by everybody.

311
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,636
All right, Caroline, Kyle, Rachel,

312
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,236
Sam, teeny, tiyana and
sue, enjoy your afternoon.

313
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,106
Grab your stuff, head out down
this way. Boat'll pick you up.

314
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,160
- Thank you, Jeff.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

315
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,000
All right, Andy, sol, Rome,

316
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,736
Gabe, Sierra, Genevieve, Anika,

317
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,336
all of you are going back
to your individual camps.

318
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,106
Grab your stuff, head out.

319
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,906
<i>I was so psyched my team won.</i>

320
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,806
And the survivor social
hour is the kind of thing

321
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,000
<i>where I'm just like, "my
god, this changes my game."</i>

322
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,606
<i>The merge is coming up,</i>

323
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,306
<i>and I'm the only lavo
going on this reward.</i>

324
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,806
<i>So, I get a chance to
talk with these people</i>

325
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,606
and tell them exactly what happened,

326
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,700
coming from a place
where <i>I'm on the bottom.</i>

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,106
My goodness.

328
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,006
- First sanctuary, guys.
- Beautiful.

329
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,676
- Bucket list.
- Finally. My god.

330
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,936
We've made it to the sanctuary.

331
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,676
Yeah.

332
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,776
We arrive at the sanctuary,
and I'm looking over,

333
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,406
and I see this big banner

334
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,106
<i>that says "survivor social hour."</i>

335
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,806
- It's a fun sign.
- Yes, it's a great sign.

336
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,806
<i>And it's looking like a real good time.</i>

337
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,306
<i>I see that there's a
cornhole, there's sodas.</i>

338
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,506
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

339
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,736
<i>And there's a grill with some dogs.</i>

340
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,436
The vegan dog!

341
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,576
- What?! No way!
- Kyle!

342
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,106
<i>And there is a veggie dog, even, for me,</i>

343
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,836
<i>because I'm a vegetarian.</i>

344
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,206
<i>So when I seen
something that I could eat,</i>

345
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,806
I lit up inside. I...

346
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,676
That's the happiest I've
ever been for food in my life.

347
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,636
Come and get it while
the getting's good, guys.

348
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,000
Yay!

349
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,106
<i>But my main thing about this is, like,</i>

350
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,806
<i>coming this close to the
merge, this is a prime opportunity</i>

351
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,506
for people to start creating
new bonds and figuring out

352
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,906
<i>the different cracks
that exist in other tribes.</i>

353
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,006
I feel like we've got a
lot of eating and a lot

354
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,476
- of talking to get to.
- Yeah.

355
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,506
So we need you to give us the down low.

356
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,050
- Yeah. I'll fill you guys in.
- Yeah.

357
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,676
- Do you want to start?
- Yeah.

358
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,106
So, basically, we get to tribal,
and I just start getting this,

359
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,106
like, weird feeling, and
they all voted together.

360
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,776
Damn. I'm sorry, teeny.

361
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,806
So now you feel like
you're on the bottom?

362
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,206
I'm just nervous all around.

363
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,936
I feel like this might be my last supper.

364
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,536
Like, that's where I'm at right now.

365
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,106
That sucks, teeny.

366
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,576
<i>I'm so excited for this
survivor social hour.</i>

367
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,676
<i>I'm here with Sam from gata,</i>

368
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,706
<i>and we're getting to bond with</i>

369
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,206
other people on other
tribes for the very first time.

370
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,960
<i>If we hit merge, having</i>

371
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,106
<i>as much information
as possible is gonna be</i>

372
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,576
really good for my game.

373
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
So, tell us about you guys.

374
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,736
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It's been weird.

375
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,906
We're the weirdest Kumbaya tribe ever.

376
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,236
- We go everywhere together.
- Do you really?

377
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,536
You don't split off at all?

378
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,336
- Not really.
- We go everywhere together.

379
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,406
I felt like the only
thing that we heard was

380
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,306
that you and Sierra were,
like, sort of running the show.

381
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,736
No. It's crazy.

382
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,106
<i>Sierra and I have a very
secret bond with one another.</i>

383
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,476
And so it's really frustrating to know

384
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,736
that two tribes might already suspect that

385
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,000
going into the merge.

386
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,536
<i>And that perception is very
dangerous for my game.</i>

387
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,436
I'm not gonna lie. This is probably

388
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,106
the best-case scenario for me right now

389
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,206
of the tuku being here.

390
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,876
This is not gonna blow
up anyone else's game.

391
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,181
Gabe has been the one
looking for idols this entire time.

392
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,306
Like, if anyone's gonna
find it, it's gonna be Gabe,

393
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,876
and he's alone right now. I'm pretty sure

394
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,436
he's looking for it at this
current moment as we speak.

395
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,976
Shoot.

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,506
It kind of worked out perfectly
because the one person

397
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,236
that I'm a little sketched
out about is not with us.

398
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,676
<i>I know that Gabe has
thrown my name out there,</i>

399
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,776
<i>so now I can make sure that</i>

400
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,506
Gabe is the first name that
kind of goes to people's heads

401
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,576
when they think of
people who are suspicious

402
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,576
and that they can't trust post-merge.

403
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,936
<i>It's a perfect play for my game.</i>

404
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,206
Gabe threw his idol
at our first tribal council.

405
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,836
He found... wait. He
already found an idol?

406
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,876
- And he played it.
- What?!

407
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,976
None of us knew that he had the idol.

408
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,836
<i>Tiyana just opens
up, talking about Gabe,</i>

409
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,836
<i>literally throwing him under the bus.</i>

410
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,606
It was shocking.

411
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,476
- I go off of vibes.
- Yeah.

412
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,836
No matter how many
times, like, me and Gabe talk,

413
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,000
it feels a little iffy.

414
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,536
<i>Gabe is basically my number one ally.</i>

415
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,500
And tiyana put a target on
Gabe's back 100% for the merge.

416
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,836
Yeah, sue.

417
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah!

418
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,236
- Almost.
- Ooh. That was close.

419
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,206
This is, like, my second sport... cornhole.

420
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,206
- Be, like... - Yeah!
- Kyle!

421
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,106
It's nice. It takes us away
from the game a little bit.

422
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,236
- Right?
- Yeah.

423
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,906
How do you feel about the people

424
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,206
- here on your tribe?
- I think the people here are good.

425
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,776
I think there's still some personalities

426
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,336
that kind of rub each
other the wrong way.

427
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,706
<i>Some people go out,
play a game of cornhole.</i>

428
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,006
I decide to keep playing survivor.

429
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,100
I haven't talked to sue at all.

430
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,676
She is my number one.
I love to work with her,

431
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,160
and whoever I'm working with...

432
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,306
Okay. Amazing.

433
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,276
<i>The survivor social
hour... it was so good.</i>

434
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,376
<i>I'm definitely feeling</i>

435
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,636
good vibes from both teeny and Rachel.

436
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,976
Rachel is someone who I
just feel comfortable around.

437
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,736
So, do you feel good with the women?

438
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,506
I feel really good with the women.

439
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,006
So, I could see us working
well in a bunch of different ways.

440
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,476
- Yeah.
- Teeny,

441
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,206
<i>on the other hand, I've
already met and established</i>

442
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,576
a great relationship with at the journey.

443
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,300
I'm over the moon. I'm absolutely thrilled.

444
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,530
<i>Yeah.</i>

445
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,276
<i>When we lose the reward challenge, it is</i>

446
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,700
the worst feeling in the world.

447
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,806
<i>I would have loved to be on that reward,</i>

448
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,936
<i>but I had to come back
hungry, knowing that I'm gonna</i>

449
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,960
<i>be eating coconut some more
and have nothing but water.</i>

450
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,300
It was definitely, definitely rough.

451
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,276
<i>But the good thing is,
with teeny not at camp,</i>

452
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,636
<i>it definitely opened up the door</i>

453
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,276
for me to start talking with sol

454
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,406
<i>about potentially getting out teeny.</i>

455
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,906
<i>It's just gonna be about</i>

456
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,376
convincing him that he can fully trust me.

457
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,236
<i>So, I've got no problem</i>

458
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,306
<i>telling sol everything,
because at the end of the day,</i>

459
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,776
you share knowledge with people.

460
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,376
That's how you build trust in this game.

461
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,576
Teeny now has the opportunity
to go talk with everybody,

462
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,000
she's got food in her belly.

463
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,676
She's gonna be a
serious threat post-merge.

464
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,936
And this is the other thing.

465
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,436
Teeny did get a three-way amulet, so,

466
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,006
if her and the other two people

467
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,506
with the amulets use it
together, it counts as an idol.

468
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,576
Fart.

469
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,906
<i>I am in complete shock.</i>

470
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,706
<i>Teeny has an amulet
which I was not aware of.</i>

471
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,106
And here's the other thing is,

472
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,106
Genevieve has told me before

473
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,236
that she doesn't want to
work with you long-term,

474
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,676
and she'd rather work with teeny.

475
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,976
But I want to work with you more
than I want to work with teeny.

476
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,960
<i>After last night's vote, I thought</i>

477
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,906
<i>that Genevieve and I could
build something strong.</i>

478
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,776
<i>So that was pretty hard.</i>

479
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,206
Rome is vomiting information to me,

480
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,776
none of it that I knew.

481
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,936
And that's where I came back to reality.

482
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,576
It's like, "sol,

483
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,600
you don't know anything
that's going on right now."

484
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,976
That sucks to hear.

485
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,576
<i>Coming in here, I have</i>

486
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,906
over 20 years sales experience.

487
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,006
I have been very, very successful

488
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,276
in my selling career, reading people,

489
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,106
<i>convincing people to do things.</i>

490
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,506
<i>So,</i>

491
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm getting a big dose
of humble pie right now.

492
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,736
<i>I know that you want sol out</i>

493
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,506
- <i>more than you want teeny out.
- Yeah.</i>

494
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,376
<i>So, hear me out.</i>

495
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,736
Sol, at the end of the day,
when it comes to actions,

496
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,676
even though I might
not be fond of the guy,

497
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,616
actions speak louder
than the words in this game.

498
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:02,906
Yeah.

499
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,676
So, he has shown more
loyalty to us than teeny.

500
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,636
<i>Right now, Rome is very chaotic.</i>

501
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,206
Even though we only
lost a reward challenge,

502
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,806
it's very reminiscent of the scramble

503
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,636
<i>that would happen after
losing an immunity challenge,</i>

504
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,800
which...

505
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,836
Yes, he's tried to come
for me, things like that.

506
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,371
But at the end of the day,
he voted with me last night.

507
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:26,706
Yeah.

508
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,236
He was the one that
brought up teeny, and

509
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,576
I think that that's our
better long-term play.

510
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,976
<i>Rome is saying</i>

511
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,806
<i>that sol is pitching teeny hard to him.</i>

512
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,000
<i>But out of all the lavo
members left standing,</i>

513
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,636
<i>teeny is the one that is just easiest</i>

514
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,536
<i>for me to work with, so...</i>

515
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,106
You got me, girl.

516
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,430
- You got me.
- What does that mean?

517
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,306
- Rome said that?
- Yeah.

518
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,976
That's very different
than what he said to me.

519
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,576
He just said you were pitching teeny.

520
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,276
- No.
- That's really interesting.

521
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,876
<i>My conversation with sol</i>

522
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,476
<i>I was a little caught off guard.</i>

523
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,306
<i>I learned that</i>

524
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,936
Rome has been very
naughty and told sol

525
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,606
<i>that I don't want to
work with sol long-term.</i>

526
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,836
<i>I mean, I know I've said it,</i>

527
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,936
we all know I've said it,

528
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,806
but I don't want sol to
know that I have said it.

529
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,014
So, you really weren't
pitching teeny to him?

530
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:26,836
Absolutely not.

531
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,276
<i>And not only that,</i>

532
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,006
<i>but Rome was the one targeting teeny.</i>

533
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,376
<i>It's not sol. So,</i>

534
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,906
if he's not telling me everything,

535
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,306
his value to me goes down

536
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,406
and his danger level goes up.

537
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,706
And at some point,
that will tip the scales,

538
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,706
<i>and it won't make sense</i>

539
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,536
<i>for me to keep Rome in
this game anymore, and</i>

540
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,700
the scales be tippin'.

541
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,576
We're just letting 'em go

542
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,976
- right now?
- We're letting 'em go

543
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,336
'cause I don't think
they can lay eggs in that.

544
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,006
You don't think they're gonna, like

545
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,936
go away as soon... Like,
as soon as they come out?

546
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,576
<i>Sam and Rachel are the ones who go</i>

547
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,476
<i>on this survivor social hour.</i>

548
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,436
<i>And so, back at camp,
myself, Sierra, and Anika</i>

549
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,906
the three of us are hungry.

550
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,876
You know, we did not win any hot dogs.

551
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,836
We have no food to speak of.

552
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,230
- Are you ready?
- Yup.

553
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,476
<i>And these chickens are,
like, unwanted members</i>

554
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,636
on the gata beach at this point.

555
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,430
Hey!

556
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,536
<i>We won this, like,</i>

557
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,676
<i>beautiful fishing kit a few days ago.</i>

558
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,106
<i>Let's put it to use. Maybe
we can catch some fish,</i>

559
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,200
and that would be, like,
a huge morale boost.

560
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,200
We're almost at the end!

561
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,906
<i>There's a lot of different
ways to go about,</i>

562
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,236
you know, fishing with this thing.

563
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,606
This is just such a joke.

564
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,860
<i>And nothing's working.</i>

565
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,676
<i>So it was just kind of
like salt in the wound.</i>

566
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,006
<i>It was sort of,</i>

567
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,906
kind of a bad afternoon after a defeat.

568
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,706
Damn, that net is huge.

569
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,106
Yeah.

570
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,636
<i>We get back to camp, and Sierra, Anika</i>

571
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,106
<i>and Andy are in the middle of trying to do</i>

572
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,600
something with the
net to get fish, I guess.

573
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,836
<i>But people are</i>

574
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,060
chomping at the bit to find
out what the heck happened.

575
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,276
Okay, well, here's the deal.

576
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,276
Tuku goes to the second tribal council.

577
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,106
<i>So, Rachel and I sit everybody down,</i>

578
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,576
<i>and I, of course, left out the fact that</i>

579
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,106
sue actually came forward and told me,

580
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,736
<i>"we heard that you and
Sierra are running things</i>

581
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,260
back at your camp."

582
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,536
<i>So I asked sue</i>

583
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,476
if they had heard anything
about our tribe dynamic,

584
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,806
basically just trying to play dumb.

585
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,676
And then sue was
like, "well, we heard that

586
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,006
you and Sierra are kind of
running things over there."

587
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,336
And that's what... I shot that down.

588
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,676
- Yeah. Good.
- It's just like, that's

589
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,476
- I'm happy you shot that down.
- And I was like,

590
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,606
"I don't feel like Sierra
and even talk all that much."

591
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,960
Yup.

592
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,476
<i>I was a little bothered to
learn that it was brought up</i>

593
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,876
that Sam and I were on,

594
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,576
you know, the top and
dominating the gata tribe.

595
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,206
<i>This is not good for my
game, but I have a few options.</i>

596
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,606
I know I have Rachel,

597
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,876
<i>Anika, and myself... the breadwinners</i>

598
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,406
we're this tight, core alliance.

599
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,736
So, first off, Caroline said,
"the women are together

600
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,040
"and we're basically just, like,

601
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,436
waiting to see what to do with the men."

602
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,576
But Sam and I have a very tight alliance

603
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,776
<i>with Andy.</i>

604
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,206
I'm sure Sam filled you in.

605
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,676
- Right.
- The three of us... that's secret.

606
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,306
- Right.
- That is confidential.

607
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,376
<i>I feel like I could go either way.</i>

608
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,006
<i>Can either kick it with
the boys or with the girls.</i>

609
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,760
<i>So, I'm like, "what is best for my game?"</i>

610
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,776
<i>I know I have a lot of power
right now, but it's kind of</i>

611
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,560
stressing me out.

612
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,776
I'm not complaining whatsoever,

613
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,906
but everyone got one hot
dog, there were no condiments.

614
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,636
- It was like...
- Really?

615
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,369
Yeah. There wasn't,
like, potato salad and that.

616
00:28:11,393 --> 00:28:11,776
Yeah.

617
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,436
<i>During the survivor social hour,</i>

618
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,906
<i>I told the other tribes
the entire, whole truth.</i>

619
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,106
<i>I told them that I was on the bottom</i>

620
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,236
<i>and I'm a little bit scared.</i>

621
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,836
So, I decide to tell my tribe
a minorly-tweaked version

622
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,336
of what I told everyone at the social hour.

623
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,706
About our tribal, I told
them what happened,

624
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,106
except for I didn't say
he stole kishan's vote.

625
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,406
<i>Basically, I wanted to make them feel like</i>

626
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,506
<i>I didn't give up any information.</i>

627
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,106
I did not get a chance
to one-on-one talk to sue,

628
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,876
but she seems like a sweetheart.

629
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,980
Who else was there? Tiyana.

630
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,936
<i>I feel like teeny almost got no information</i>

631
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,836
when she could have
got way more information.

632
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,106
<i>That's just appalling to me, so,</i>

633
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,676
there's a lot of red flags at this moment

634
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,130
with teeny in the game.

635
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,730
He told that to your face?

636
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,960
Hundred percent.

637
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,236
<i>So, the second Rome walks away,</i>

638
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,876
Genevieve and sol start telling me

639
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,776
that Rome went absolutely nuts

640
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,536
<i>when they got back from the challenge,</i>

641
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,706
<i>and that is music to my ears.</i>

642
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,150
And then he goes,
"teeny has the amulet idol."

643
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:29,676
Okay.

644
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,406
- Figured.
- Yeah.

645
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,936
<i>After last night,</i>

646
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,776
<i>I was so nervous about
my life in this game,</i>

647
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,106
<i>and now the tables
have turned a little bit.</i>

648
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,976
Because of the madness
that occurred today,

649
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,876
<i>I feel like sol and
Genevieve finally see the light</i>

650
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,806
on what I've known, basically,

651
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,376
since the beginning of this game,

652
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,960
<i>which is that Rome's unpredictability</i>

653
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,960
<i>and manner of playing this game is just</i>

654
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,676
too chaotic to have, long-term.

655
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,360
I want him gone.

656
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,636
I'm not even gonna say "if."

657
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,336
When we get to the merge, all of us...

658
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,176
Those guys are scattering,
like, friggin', like...

659
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,236
- Like, I swear to god.
- Yeah. They're running.

660
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,436
<i>We come home, and I
felt horrible knowing that</i>

661
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,006
<i>tiyana put a target on
Gabe's back in front of</i>

662
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,836
the whole social hour.

663
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,306
I'm just gonna hop in
the water really fast, then

664
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,276
- I'll go crabbing.
- Yeah.

665
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,736
And then, also, cutting
up coconuts for Gabe.

666
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,806
And I want him to do,
like, literally nothing.

667
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,706
<i>I think tiyana did it intentionally so that</i>

668
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,536
<i>others will look at him as a threat.</i>

669
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,776
So, if she can't take him out
with us, she wants him gone.

670
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,706
<i>And that makes me
pretty upset because he's</i>

671
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,630
basically my number one ally.

672
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,406
<i>My strategy right now is
trying to keep options open,</i>

673
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,936
<i>but tuku is falling apart.</i>

674
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,376
It's looking more and more likely

675
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,976
all five of us might be
making it to the merge.

676
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,960
<i>And I'm just thinking, "how
can we work together?"</i>

677
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,606
<i>My fear is that Gabe has</i>

678
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,376
<i>all trust gone with tiyana because</i>

679
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,860
she threw him under the bus.

680
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,976
<i>I'm trying to be the mother hen</i>

681
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,106
<i>and help us all form a
cohesive, wonderful family.</i>

682
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,330
And they're all running away.

683
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,636
<i>And I'm like, "let me try to
get one back in the Coop."</i>

684
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,230
<i>I want her to tell Gabe the full truth.</i>

685
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,306
'Cause I'm worried about
Gabe finding out about it.

686
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,976
- About?
- About what you said.

687
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,976
I just don't see a world in
which if he's at the merge,

688
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
he doesn't find out
about what happened.

689
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,406
'Cause I'll be honest. I don't know

690
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,576
if Gabe will trust you after this.

691
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,336
<i>Caroline suggested to me</i>

692
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,936
<i>that I come clean with Gabe.</i>

693
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,936
I didn't feel, in that moment,

694
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,106
that I needed to apologize, but

695
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,960
<i>if I ignore their advice,</i>

696
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,736
<i>no one will trust me because they know</i>

697
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,200
I'm not listening to them.

698
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,976
<i>So, if Caroline wants
me to apologize to Gabe</i>

699
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,776
and it would make Gabe feel happy,

700
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,660
it just seems like the right thing to do.

701
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,306
<i>Tiyana said that she
had a private conversation</i>

702
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,776
with two other people,
<i>that I played the idol,</i>

703
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,230
<i>but I don't believe it in the slightest.</i>

704
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,736
Yeah.

705
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,206
But I also wanted to
be completely honest.

706
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,876
That was it. Like...

707
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,276
<i>The whole time, I'm just like,</i>

708
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,606
"yeah."

709
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,976
- Yeah.
- "Okay."

710
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,576
- Okay.
- Tiyana,

711
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,906
I've never once trusted anything
that comes out of your mouth.

712
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,776
It was just that I played the idol, it wasn't

713
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,636
anything about, like,
my game or anything?

714
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,106
No. I literally only told - okay.

715
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,006
- Rachel and teeny about that.
- Okay.

716
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,636
- Don't worry about it, we're totally cool.
- Dude. Gabe.

717
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,106
We're totally cool. Don't worry about it.

718
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,336
- I really am, like, so sorry.
- No worries.

719
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,476
<i>I get my bs apology from tiyana.</i>

720
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,306
That doesn't make me feel good.

721
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,806
I-I think if tiyana was not
compelled to apologize to me,

722
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,430
then she would not have.

723
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:22,876
She said that she only
talked to Rachel and teeny,

724
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,606
and it was in a private
conversation with them

725
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,900
that she said that I played my idol.

726
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,736
<i>I'm angry at how open and brazen</i>

727
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,836
<i>tiyana was about throwing
my name out there.</i>

728
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,236
<i>But I've been ready to cut tiyana out</i>

729
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,836
<i>for a long time. I want to
crush her survivor dreams.</i>

730
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,736
I want to watch her torch get snuffed out

731
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,560
and I want to smile while it happens.

732
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,936
Look, there are a lot of
things required to win survivor

733
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,736
but ultimately, it's gonna
come down to your relationships.

734
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,676
Do you think you have
what it takes to pull it off?

735
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,030
Apply to be on survivor.

736
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,730
Come on in!

737
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,106
Good morning, tuku.

738
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,506
- Good morning, Jeff.
- Good morning, Jeff.

739
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,676
Morning, sunshine.

740
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,236
Come on in, lavo.

741
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,130
Down to four.

742
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,900
Here comes a very
slow-moving gata tribe.

743
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,130
With their chickens.

744
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,506
Got all three?

745
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,730
- All three, Jeff.
- All three.

746
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,300
This gonna be interesting.

747
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,876
Well, let's just start with the obvious.

748
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,276
Are they family members
that travel with you now

749
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,960
or is this about something else?

750
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,706
You know, Jeff, we,
as a tribe, would like to

751
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,336
- propose a negotiation with you.
- I love a negotiation.

752
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,376
- I know you do.
- Tell me what you're thinking.

753
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,106
Well, the thing is, we

754
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,436
you know, we saw that
second place got the six eggs,

755
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,906
initially. They -okay.

756
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,406
Popped out, in two and
a half days, three eggs.

757
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,636
Two of them shattered before
we could even get to 'em.

758
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,236
'Cause they just pop out.

759
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,436
So, first of all, Sam, is the reason

760
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,476
you've not chosen to eat the chickens

761
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,836
a moral decision?

762
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,960
Not everybody was comfortable

763
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,436
with the idea of eating the chickens.

764
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,106
- Okay.
- So, you want to make sure

765
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,576
everybody's comfortable on our tribe.

766
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,476
Eating the chickens...
not really an option for us.

767
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,960
And they kind of suck at making eggs.

768
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,606
So you're saying you want to trade

769
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,276
- the chickens for eggs?
- Correct.

770
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,306
- Yes.
- Okay.

771
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,606
- What's the offer?
- I think

772
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,506
two dozen sounds pretty good, Jeff.

773
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,636
So, 24 eggs. Okay.

774
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,960
On survivor, we see
the chicken as a dilemma

775
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,336
in this sense:

776
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,636
You can eat the chicken

777
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,406
or you can use the
eggs from the chicken.

778
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,936
Those eggs are gonna
be hatched over 16 days,

779
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,306
so that's a little bit
like winning the lottery,

780
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,976
and you get paid a little every year.

781
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,976
You want to put all
your eggs in one basket.

782
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,936
You want to get paid right now.

783
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,706
That comes at a reduced price.

784
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,206
So, you're asking for 24 eggs,

785
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,730
which is eight per chicken.

786
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,236
I'll counter at five per chicken.

787
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,436
That's 15 total eggs.

788
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,376
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

789
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,576
Shall we meet in the middle?

790
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,006
Which is never great negotiating,

791
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,676
but I'm willing to do it. 18.

792
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,106
- Let's do it.
- Eighteen eggs.

793
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,536
- Done, you have a deal.
- Deal. - Deal, Jeff.

794
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,936
- Thank you.
- All right.

795
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,536
Eighteen eggs will be
waiting for you back at camp.

796
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,406
- The chickens will stay with me.
- All right.

797
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,106
- Thanks. -Thanks, Jeff.
- Good for you guys.

798
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,606
All right. Shall we get
to - good for you guys.

799
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,906
Today's immunity challenge?

800
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,436
All right,

801
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,340
first things first. Got
to take back the idols.

802
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,460
Thank you. Thank you.

803
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,106
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

804
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,836
<i>For today's challenge, you're gonna drag</i>

805
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,106
<i>a very heavy net... hey! Sorry.</i>

806
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,536
- What happened?
- He's just

807
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,806
biting my foot, and I - pecked her toes.

808
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,276
- Take care of him.
- That's what

809
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,000
family members who are
left on the side of the road do.

810
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,976
They got to go.

811
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,276
If you... I'll just step away.

812
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,960
- Sorry.
- All right.

813
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,936
For today's challenge, you're gonna drag

814
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,506
<i>a very heavy net</i>

815
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,760
<i>full of coconuts and
sandbags along the course.</i>

816
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,000
<i>Along the way, you're gonna</i>

817
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,276
<i>collect more sandbags
and more coconuts,</i>

818
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,476
<i>making it even heavier.</i>

819
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,576
<i>When you get to the finish,
you're gonna throw the sandbags</i>

820
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,476
<i>at a puzzle wall until
you knock off every block,</i>

821
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,000
<i>then race to reassemble
the exact same puzzle.</i>

822
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,336
First two tribes to finish win immunity,

823
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,000
safe from the vote,
will not be sent home.

824
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,276
Tribal council, where somebody will be

825
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,106
the fifth person voted out

826
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,976
of survivor 47. All right,

827
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,706
we have sit-outs. Gata,

828
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,376
one extra person who you
can sit out. It can be anybody,

829
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,606
because everybody
participated in the last challenge.

830
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,676
- Jeff, I'm gonna sit out.
- Anika gonna sit out for gata.

831
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,436
- Tuku, one extra person.
- I'm gonna sit out.

832
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,960
Sue, you're gonna sit this
one out. All right, sit outs,

833
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,336
take a spot on the
bench. Everybody else,

834
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,636
give you a minute to
strategize. We'll get it on.

835
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,830
Here we go.

836
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,306
All right, here we go.

837
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,106
For immunity.

838
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,500
Survivors ready?

839
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,976
Go!

840
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,676
First, you got to drag
that bag to your first mat.

841
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,106
Yep, yep, we're on it.

842
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,406
- Go. Hey, go, go, go!
- You're good, you're good,

843
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,106
- you're good.
- Good job, guys!

844
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,106
Now you're gonna saw a rope.

845
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,106
We've got Kyle for tuku,

846
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,906
sol for lavo, - nice, sol.

847
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,706
Andy for gata.

848
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,976
Come on, gata!

849
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,700
Let's go, Andy.

850
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,576
Turn it around, turn it around.

851
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,706
- Flip it. You need the blade.
- Yeah, that one.

852
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,106
There you go.

853
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,336
Kyle working it for tuku.

854
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,660
- Come on, baby.
- Yes, Kyle.

855
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,636
Kyle has his for tuku.

856
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,106
Good job, Kyle.

857
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,536
Now you got to get all your coconuts

858
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,276
and your sandbags into your bag.

859
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,236
- Don't throw them so hard, guys.
- Okay.

860
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,376
- Yeah. There it is, sol. Go!
- Go! Go!

861
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,106
Sol has his.

862
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,730
Andy, still working for gata.

863
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,576
Keep cutting, Andy.

864
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,236
Come on, Andy!

865
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,106
- Good job!
- Andy struggling.

866
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,676
Come on, Andy. We need you, bud.

867
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,106
- Let's go.
- One, two.

868
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,806
Tuku thinks they have all their sandbags.

869
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,106
- You're good!
- We're good.

870
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,676
Hurdle. Hit it hard, hit it hard.

871
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,936
Tuku in the lead, still.

872
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,876
Tuku at the second stage.

873
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,306
Come on, guys!

874
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,106
Got to get all the coconuts in that bag.

875
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,806
Try to get as far back as you can.

876
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,506
- All right, we're good.
- Lavo, you're good! - Go!

877
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,576
Those bags are heavy.

878
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,106
- Andy still working.
- Keep pushing, Andy!

879
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,706
You got this.

880
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,106
This is a huge early setback

881
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,776
- for gata.
- You got it.

882
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,606
Gata has theirs!

883
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,230
Finally. They got a lot
of time to catch up now.

884
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,636
- Help put them in the bag.
- I need help!

885
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,636
Once you have all the
coconuts, you can move on.

886
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,906
Go.

887
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,676
Tuku, you're good.

888
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,830
Hit it hard, hit it hard, hit it hard!

889
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,236
That bag is very heavy now.

890
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,176
One, two, three, pull!

891
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,506
Tuku doing a nice job working together.

892
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,836
One, two, three, pull!

893
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,006
It is tuku in the lead, then lavo.

894
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,076
Rome, help him lift it.

895
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,536
- Gata has a lot of time to make up.
- Let's go.

896
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,576
- One, two, three, pull!
- One, two, three, pull!

897
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,806
Tuku now can empty the bag.

898
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,136
- Sandbags in the...
- I'll organize it. Yup.

899
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,576
I got coconuts.

900
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,276
Everyone watch your step.

901
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,160
Let's go, lavo! That bag is heavy.

902
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,736
Gata, you're good. Let's go!

903
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,306
Gata, you got this!

904
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,306
I believe in you!

905
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,376
Let's go, gata. You're in this.

906
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,006
Keep pushing.

907
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,376
Tuku with a huge early lead.

908
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,536
Lavo trying to close the gap.

909
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,306
Almost there. Five more steps.

910
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,536
Once you have every sandbag,

911
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,876
then you can start knocking
down your puzzle wall.

912
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,876
- That's it. - Good.
- You're good! Go, tuku!

913
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,106
- Toss it, Caroline. Go.
- I got it. I got it.

914
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,576
Anybody can throw.

915
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,330
Tiyana up first.

916
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,006
Kyle with a toss.

917
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,376
It is gata working at the second stage.

918
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,206
Shoving 'em.

919
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,960
Kyle with a big arm.

920
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,106
There's a couple of blocks for tuku.

921
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,107
Good job, guys.

922
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:30,476
You're good, lavo.

923
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,360
It is now lavo that can start
breaking down their wall.

924
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,936
- Got it!
- Kyle with another nice toss.

925
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,836
- Nice, sol!
- Sol, wow!

926
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,776
Sol knocks five blocks completely off.

927
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,006
And gata is still inexplicably working

928
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,460
at the second stage.

929
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,736
There goes tiyana. Nice toss.

930
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,130
Yeah, tiyana!

931
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,200
- Yeah, sol!
- Sol with another big hit.

932
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,936
- Yes, Rome!
- Rome with a nice toss.

933
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,836
We are neck-and-neck.

934
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,706
- Yup.
- Yeah, sol!

935
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,576
Sol with another one.

936
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,900
And now it gets harder to
get those bottom blocks off.

937
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,960
- Yes!
- Yes, Gabe! -And Gabe for tuku

938
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,636
with a nice hit. There goes Rome.

939
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,336
They're moving them slowly.

940
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,900
You have blocks blocking
the blocks. That's a problem.

941
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,876
Tuku, you're good. Start rebuilding.

942
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,876
- Come on, tuku!
- Now you got to get

943
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,300
all your pieces back on your mat.

944
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,406
- Go, gata!
- Push!

945
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,000
Gata finally out of the second stage.

946
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,776
Push, dig deep!

947
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,306
You're good.

948
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,576
Now unload.

949
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,336
You got this, gata!

950
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,400
Tuku working on putting
their puzzle back together.

951
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,606
But lavo has hit a roadblock.

952
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,476
It's gonna take a big
gun to move those blocks,

953
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,006
'cause they are jammed up.

954
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,606
- Got to get 'em off that table.
- We're so close.

955
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,830
- Let's go.
- You're good, gata. Let's go!

956
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:03,406
Big gun from Sam
knocks off four blocks.

957
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,806
Sierra with a nice rocket.

958
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,676
Gata's made up a lot of time.

959
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,000
It is lavo slowing down now.

960
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,676
That's okay. We can do this.

961
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,106
Come on.

962
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,236
Everybody's in this now,
'cause we're looking for two.

963
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,406
You got this, guys, you're in it!

964
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,560
Another gun from Sam.

965
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,536
So frustrating.

966
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,236
- Yup. Good. That's it.
- Yup.

967
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,876
Tuku with a huge lead right now.

968
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,476
- Ready? - Yup. Yeah.
- Yes.

969
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,806
Here comes Sam
again with another toss.

970
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,636
Lavo, keep working. They cannot

971
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,736
- be touching the frame.
- Yeah, sol!

972
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,406
Here comes Andy.

973
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,976
Yeah!

974
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,536
- Andy did it! You're good!
- There you go, Andy!

975
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,776
A huge comeback from gata.

976
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,336
- One more, one more.
- There goes Rome.

977
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,676
You're good!

978
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,130
Let's go, lavo!

979
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,106
- And then this one.
- Yeah.

980
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,830
Tuku with another piece, getting closer.

981
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,000
You guys ready?

982
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,476
- Double-check.
- Jeff! Jeff!

983
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,260
- Jeff! Jeff!
- Tuku thinks they have it.

984
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,306
And they do!

985
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:10,906
Tuku wins immunity,
safe from tribal council.

986
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,530
- My god.
- Hey, hey.

987
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,506
Lavo and gata... they are literally

988
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,000
starting on this puzzle
at the exact same time.

989
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,776
- This is top left.
- Yeah, that's right. - Nice.

990
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,776
- Immunity on the line.
- Yeah, perfect.

991
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,206
Somebody going home tonight.

992
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,376
Player number five of
survivor 47, say bye-bye.

993
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,236
- Face 'em all the right way, si. Don't...
- I... they're the right way.

994
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,936
No. Like, this needs to face us.

995
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,736
- Yeah, but she needs to be able to see.
- Hey, no fighting.

996
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,836
Gata was dead last but
once again, a huge comeback.

997
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,976
Fighting to stay alive in this game.

998
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,436
Wait, wait, wait, gimme that one back.

999
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,876
I can't see the puzzle

1000
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,106
if we're facing the pieces
upside down and sideways.

1001
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,236
- That's it? - Yeah.
- Yup.

1002
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,236
Lavo with another piece.
We are still neck-and-neck.

1003
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,506
You're so close, you're
so close, you're so close!

1004
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:54,906
I think something else is wrong.

1005
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,706
- Yeah. Yeah.
- There it is. There it is.

1006
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,536
- Wing needs to go on this side.
- This is gonna

1007
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,976
- come down to the wire.
- You got it, guys!

1008
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,736
- That's right. That's right.
- You got this!

1009
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,676
Quick, quick, quick!

1010
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,436
- One more. - Jeff!
- Jeff!

1011
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,776
Lavo thinks they have
it. Get back to your mat.

1012
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,306
Put it back. Put it back.

1013
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:13,006
- Go, go, go!
- Move! - Sol falls.

1014
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,030
There you go. You got it.

1015
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,706
That's it. That's it.

1016
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,130
You're good!

1017
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,376
Lavo pulls it out in the
last seconds over gata...

1018
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,936
Thank you!

1019
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,536
My god!

1020
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,000
Sending gata back

1021
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,106
to tribal council, where somebody

1022
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,106
will be the fifth person
voted out of survivor 47.

1023
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,500
My gosh.

1024
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,000
That was tight.

1025
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,760
- Wow.
- Wow.

1026
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,130
Lavo, big, emotional win.

1027
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,476
- Rome, tell me - about the emotion.
- I mean,

1028
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,706
we knew coming into today

1029
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:53,106
that we're the only tribe

1030
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,876
where the majority of us hasn't had

1031
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,436
anything but coconut the last six days.

1032
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,576
We came in knowing that
we're gonna be super low energy,

1033
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,776
and we just told everyone,
"just give it our all.

1034
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,206
"Just put your whole heart
into it and don't give up,

1035
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,636
"no matter how hard it might get.

1036
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,106
Just power through
and try to not go to tribal."

1037
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,536
And the fact that we
were able to do it today,

1038
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,706
it just shows us why you
never give up on survivor, Jeff.

1039
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:17,776
All right, tuku, congratulations.

1040
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,706
Immunity is yours.

1041
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,206
Nobody going home from your tribe.

1042
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,106
Lavo, big win indeed.

1043
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,106
Immunity is yours.

1044
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,406
And you get your flint back.

1045
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:29,376
Let's go. We got fire,
man. Thank you, Jeff.

1046
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,300
Most importantly, nobody
going home from your tribe.

1047
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,676
Tuku, grab your stuff, head out,

1048
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,106
enjoy the night off. Nobody going home.

1049
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,000
Great job.

1050
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,107
Great job, guys.

1051
00:46:43,131 --> 00:46:45,276
Lavo, grab your stuff, head out.

1052
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,230
- Enjoy the night off from me.
- Thank you.

1053
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,106
So, Rachel, the afternoon started off

1054
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,106
pretty well. We had a nice negotiation.

1055
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,906
Eggs waiting for you back
at camp, but the result is

1056
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,636
- tribal council.
- And no way to cook the eggs.

1057
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,636
The great irony of having

1058
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,206
- 18 eggs back at camp.
- Shoot.

1059
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,576
Because I'm gonna take your flint.

1060
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,106
- You're gonna take our flint.
- All right, gata,

1061
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,006
tribal council tonight,
where somebody will be

1062
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,336
the fifth person voted out of survivor 47.

1063
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,876
And as a penalty for losing,

1064
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,836
I will take that flint
and your ability to cook.

1065
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,336
All right, grab your stuff,

1066
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,236
head out. See you
tonight at tribal council.

1067
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,836
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Jeff.

1068
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,876
<i>This immunity challenge,
was a tough one, and</i>

1069
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,276
after ten days out here, I can conclude

1070
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,976
I'm not good at challenges.

1071
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,736
<i>So, tonight, it could be me.</i>

1072
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,906
<i>I've been on the bottom</i>

1073
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,206
<i>for a very long time in this game, but</i>

1074
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,706
I've laid a lot of groundwork
on what could happen

1075
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,436
<i>if we were to go to a tribal council.</i>

1076
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,476
<i>And I feel like this is
the real start of my game.</i>

1077
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,600
<i>I'm looking forward to tonight.</i>

1078
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,336
- Great job, everyone.
- Great job. - Great job.

1079
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,506
<i>The challenge was a total flop.</i>

1080
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,376
We rode the high of
our chicken negotiation

1081
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,930
all the way down to rock bottom.

1082
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,936
No, it's okay. Just for my part.

1083
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,636
<i>Andy, once again, can't seem</i>

1084
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,306
<i>to get out of his own way in a challenge.</i>

1085
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,106
At one point, Andy is sawing the rope

1086
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:33,676
<i>with the non-saw part of the saw.</i>

1087
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,376
You come that close to immunity

1088
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,736
and then your mind goes,
"would have been nice

1089
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,936
if we would have sawed
that rope just a little bit faster."

1090
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,376
<i>I can't stop thinking</i>

1091
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,936
<i>about how much I
want to cook those eggs.</i>

1092
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,376
- Yup.
- This is the only morning

1093
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,676
since we got here that
we didn't make a fire.

1094
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,676
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

1095
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,106
<i>The fact we were able to negotiate</i>

1096
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:54,536
for 18 eggs is so major.

1097
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,006
<i>The only downside is that
we lost the immunity challenge</i>

1098
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,936
<i>and had to give away our flint,</i>

1099
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,676
and therefore, have no fire.

1100
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,106
- Wash off?
- Yeah. I'm down for that.

1101
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,776
<i>There are multiple times
throughout the challenge.</i>

1102
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,306
<i>Andy made it harder for
my tribe and not easier.</i>

1103
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:13,906
<i>I like Andy as a person,</i>

1104
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,976
<i>but I think our tribe will
be genuinely better off</i>

1105
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,530
without Andy here.

1106
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,206
This shirt is so nasty,

1107
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,306
no matter how much I scrub.

1108
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,636
I'm gonna pee.

1109
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,776
- I'm gonna go this way.
- You pee.

1110
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,006
<i>I lost my vote on a journey, but</i>

1111
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,406
even though I don't have my vote,

1112
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,736
I am not worried

1113
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,606
<i>because I know where my alliances lie.</i>

1114
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:41,030
<i>So, I'm sure Andy is going home tonight.</i>

1115
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,476
Yeah, me, too.

1116
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,476
<i>Andy is definitely a little bit</i>

1117
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,706
<i>of a liability, challenge-wise,</i>

1118
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,306
<i>and it is super, super frustrating. But,</i>

1119
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,436
<i>long-term, I don't trust Anika, so,</i>

1120
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,300
I want Anika out of here.
I-I'm ready for her to go.

1121
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,736
I feel in danger tonight, so,

1122
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,176
whoever extends a lifeline is the person

1123
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,036
- I'm ready to be loyal to in the game.
- Yeah.

1124
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,436
- Does that make sense?
- No, it does.

1125
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,306
- Yeah.
- Like, numbers.

1126
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,106
<i>After all my efforts, I truly believe</i>

1127
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,436
<i>that Anika is buying what
I'm selling, that she believes</i>

1128
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,106
that I truly feel on the bottom.

1129
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,876
It would just be... It would feel so good

1130
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,576
to, like, you know, be a part of the group.

1131
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,406
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1132
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,806
<i>My alliance with Sam
and Sierra is top secret,</i>

1133
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,006
<i>and I think that Anika
is very, very confident</i>

1134
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,236
<i>and very sure about
what's happening tonight.</i>

1135
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,236
Suffice to say, I think she
underestimates people,

1136
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,806
and she underestimates me.

1137
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,206
- I don't feel secure tonight.
- Yeah.

1138
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,276
So, yeah, I'm-i'm a
free number right now.

1139
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,276
I'm a completely free number, so,

1140
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,806
if at any point today you're like,

1141
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,306
"I need a number for this," - yeah.

1142
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:47,936
- You just let me know.
- I mean, I appreciate that.

1143
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,406
- Yeah.
- And, like,

1144
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,176
- I don't know what's happening yet.
- Okay.

1145
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,976
I know my role. I have a
very specific role to play here

1146
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,606
<i>if we're gonna blindside Anika.</i>

1147
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,076
If there is some plan out
there, let me be a part of it.

1148
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,436
<i>Here's how my plan works.
I want Anika and Rachel</i>

1149
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,606
to see me as someone
feeling very much on the outs,

1150
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,376
<i>which they believe I am.</i>

1151
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,936
<i>So I say to Anika and Rachel,</i>

1152
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,106
"pull me into your master
plan. I will be so loyal to you."

1153
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,536
<i>I want them to respond to that</i>

1154
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,836
<i>and be like, "okay, the
best thing that we can do"</i>

1155
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,536
"to prevent Andy from
playing his shot in the dark is

1156
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,006
to feed him a fake plan."

1157
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,966
So, since Andy is so eager

1158
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,376
to be part of a plan,
then we sell him one.

1159
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,306
I feel like it'd be believable

1160
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,966
that we were trying to get Sam out,

1161
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,271
- yeah, I agree.
- 'Cause we're trying to keep the girls.

1162
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,750
I go back to camp, and
then pretty soon after.

1163
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,106
<i>Anika and Rachel pull
me aside. They're like,</i>

1164
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,636
"hey, Andy, come here,
come here, come here."

1165
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,230
Yeah.

1166
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,836
Well, just lay it on me, please.

1167
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,400
Please, yes.

1168
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,776
<i>They do exactly what
I expected them to do.</i>

1169
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,106
They're giving me a fake plan.

1170
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,236
It is the name that I expected: Sam.

1171
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,476
Yeah.

1172
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,736
I'm in. I'm in.

1173
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,636
<i>I was very well prepared for that,</i>

1174
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,106
<i>because I set it up.</i>

1175
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,876
I set up that conversation.
They don't know that,

1176
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,436
but that's exactly what happened.

1177
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,106
I'll act completely natural.
You can trust me with that.

1178
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,476
- Yeah.
- They're believing

1179
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,606
exactly what I'm feeding them,

1180
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,406
<i>hook, line and sinker.</i>

1181
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,576
<i>I feel like I have all my eggs
in the right basket right now.</i>

1182
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,606
I just got to boil 'em.

1183
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,106
<i>Dude,</i>

1184
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,936
why am I sitting here, like,
over and over in my head,

1185
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,436
making sure that we're
making the right decision?

1186
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,436
We are doing the right thing,
I'm a million percent sure.

1187
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,960
Anika getting out is the thing.

1188
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:31,092
I'm looking at her in
her eyes, and I'm like

1189
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:31,506
I know.

1190
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,206
I feel like a piece of crap.

1191
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,106
- You... I know you do.
- I mean, what the hell am I gonna

1192
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,506
<i>I think right now, Sierra
and I are just trying</i>

1193
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,436
<i>to figure out how to
navigate as a pair when both</i>

1194
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,966
of our individual interests
might be slightly different.

1195
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,106
<i>Sierra really wants to keep Anika around.</i>

1196
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,106
I know how you're feeling
about looking into her eyes,

1197
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,106
but, like, this whole, like,

1198
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,936
"ani is your best
friend" thing is her game.

1199
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,506
That's what she's trying to play.

1200
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,376
I really want to keep Andy around,

1201
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,006
<i>but Sierra is my number one.</i>

1202
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,706
<i>So we have to find a way
to keep each other calm</i>

1203
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,776
while we figure out what
the heck we're gonna do.

1204
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,376
Are you, like, 100% sure ani can't vote?

1205
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,406
- Ani 100% can't vote.
- Okay.

1206
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,776
<i>Going into tribal tonight,</i>

1207
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,006
<i>Sam and I... we have
to get on the same page.</i>

1208
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,336
<i>He wants to keep Andy,</i>

1209
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,636
<i>but is keeping Andy the best</i>

1210
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,476
for my game? I know it's probably best

1211
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,406
for Sam's game, but is it best for mine?

1212
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,129
I have to figure out
what to do with the idol.

1213
00:53:24,153 --> 00:53:24,476
Your...

1214
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,606
- 'Cause everything...
- That's the thing.

1215
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:26,836
Keeping Andy.

1216
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,276
He's now gonna lose a little trust.

1217
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,806
He's gonna be like, "why
did you keep that from me?"

1218
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,806
- Yeah.
- That's a target on your back.

1219
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,106
'Cause he's gonna tell other people.

1220
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,536
I know he would tell other people that.

1221
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,776
You know that, like, for
me, that's a huge risk.

1222
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,406
My hidden immunity idol is only
good for my next tribal council,

1223
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,106
which means it's only good tonight.

1224
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,676
<i>I have to play it tonight, but
that creates some fireworks.</i>

1225
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,106
<i>If I play an idol</i>

1226
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,990
<i>and I've kept it from
Andy this entire time,</i>

1227
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,776
how does that impact my relationship

1228
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,966
and my trust with him moving forward?

1229
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:58,930
<i>So, maybe the safe move
is voting out Andy tonight.</i>

1230
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,276
<i>But I've wanted Anika out of the game</i>

1231
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,436
<i>for a long, long time.</i>

1232
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,506
<i>Basically, it comes down to
what Sierra and I want to do,</i>

1233
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,506
<i>who we want to take with us further.</i>

1234
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,360
<i>So, tonight, that's all the power.</i>

1235
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,436
All right.

1236
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,106
Let's go back in time and talk about

1237
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,376
the social hour reward.

1238
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,966
Rachel, you were a part of that.

1239
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,966
What was the most interesting
thing that you learned?

1240
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:06,106
Yeah, I mean, we learned
about a few of the dynamics

1241
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,606
that happened at tribal.

1242
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,476
We learned that Gabe played an idol

1243
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,766
at the first tribal council.

1244
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,960
That was shocking to us.

1245
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,376
- Yeah.
- We also learned teeny was

1246
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,866
blindsided by the kishan vote.

1247
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,806
So, yes, they could be lying, but

1248
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,736
those would be kind of
weird things to lie about.

1249
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,406
Sam, what do you
think was the impression

1250
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,966
- they had of your tribe?
- I mean,

1251
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,936
I think they bought, like,
everything that we said.

1252
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,106
We kind of tried to not
give too many details

1253
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,360
and just be "gata the
listeners," in the background.

1254
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,636
Andy, what do you think
about how Sam and Rachel did

1255
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,936
as spies going out to get information?

1256
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,676
I mean, I think they did an excellent job.

1257
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,336
I trusted them completely
because we've talked a lot about

1258
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,306
managing our perception
to the other tribes,

1259
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:53,006
and there's a very clear picture
to paint that I'm on the bottom

1260
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,766
as a result of my emotional
moment on day three

1261
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,106
at the challenge. I said things that were,

1262
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,866
explosive, you could say,

1263
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,966
but I've made so much
headway, especially socially.

1264
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:08,990
I don't think, at the end of
the day, people really care

1265
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,576
how good I am at a balance beam

1266
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,836
or sawing a piece of rope.

1267
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,506
- Well, your tribe mates care.
- True.

1268
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,966
True, true. That is... It's important,

1269
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,006
but I think what's more
important to my tribe is

1270
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,606
getting to learn, you know,
what I am made of on the inside,

1271
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,936
and I-I like what I see.

1272
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,936
So, Rachel, this is setting us up nicely

1273
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,006
for the conversation about tonight's vote.

1274
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,766
Who do we vote out and why?

1275
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:36,476
That's the tricky, tricky
part of survivor, where

1276
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,106
you have to weigh out the
pros and cons of each person.

1277
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:41,106
Like, this person may
be really emotional,

1278
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,406
and they wear their heart on the sleeve.

1279
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,706
That could really help you

1280
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,006
or it can really hurt you, you know?

1281
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,960
And so, I wish I knew the answer, Jeff.

1282
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,436
Very tricky.

1283
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,666
Sierra, where do you sit with this?

1284
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,960
I mean, I think it's
great to keep individuals

1285
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:56,866
who you trust, you form bonds with,

1286
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,806
because going into a merge,
which can be a shaky situation,

1287
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:03,536
you want to feel strong and
comfortable with your alliances.

1288
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,006
But I also think there's 100% a benefit

1289
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,906
of keeping somebody who is not exactly

1290
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,406
as "liked" and fitting in and
gelling with the whole crew

1291
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,736
because to me, that's a person

1292
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,336
you want to keep around
because, you know,

1293
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,106
that's somebody that's
an easy number out

1294
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,476
come later on in the game.

1295
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,936
Anika, how about for you?

1296
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,506
Every tribal decision
each one of us makes

1297
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,376
creates a completely different pathway

1298
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,736
for our own personal game.

1299
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,336
There could be eight billion diff...

1300
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,436
Well, actually, in this case,
five different pathways.

1301
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,866
Okay, there's five different pathways

1302
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,936
that you could possibly take in this game,

1303
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,336
and tonight we are going to find out

1304
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,406
which is the next
pathway we decide to take.

1305
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:47,106
Rachel, one big word
in what Anika just said.

1306
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,666
"We." what is your sense of confidence

1307
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,106
in knowing who the "we" is, and that

1308
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,106
- you are a part of the "we"?
- I mean,

1309
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:58,276
I believe that the "we"
that I established today, like,

1310
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,806
is the "we." You know?
And I-I look around, and I...

1311
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:04,436
Meet the eyes of the
people that I believe.

1312
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,566
I... I'm working with, and
I feel confident about that.

1313
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,436
But having cohesion
coming out of this vote is

1314
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,306
the most important thing.

1315
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:17,276
And so tonight is about
solidifying the alliance

1316
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,436
that I want to be in come the merge.

1317
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,336
And Sam, what Rachel
says seems simple.

1318
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,536
Four people get together
and you vote out one person,

1319
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,376
and you four are in Harmony.

1320
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,106
But it's not always easy.

1321
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,236
So is there some fear that maybe

1322
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,666
we don't come out of this with

1323
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,906
- everybody in Harmony?
- Yeah.

1324
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,636
Cohesion is not always a guarantee,

1325
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,736
but I feel confident tonight

1326
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,476
that my "we" is going to
be cohesive after the vote.

1327
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,236
Anika, how confident are you

1328
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,276
that are part of the "we"?

1329
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,106
It is so silly, but I also think

1330
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:53,906
that I'm also hopefully in the "we,"

1331
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,436
and we'll just have to see.

1332
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,336
Andy, how confident are
you that you're with the "we"?

1333
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,376
Yeah, for right now,
tonight, I'm trying to turn

1334
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,236
the "me" into a "we." I'm trying

1335
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,406
to build this vote to be the one vote

1336
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:07,406
where I really feel like

1337
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:10,606
I've entered into a group
of people that I can trust.

1338
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,536
And if I can survive,

1339
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,106
then, yeah, now I'm part of a "we."

1340
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:18,106
I'm nervous for sure,
but I feel like I have a...

1341
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,206
A shred of hope.

1342
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,106
And I just want to

1343
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:23,400
sort of get to it and, you
know, sort of see my fate.

1344
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:28,906
All right.

1345
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,706
It is time to vote.

1346
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,490
Rachel, you're up.

1347
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,536
I've been burying you
for the last ten days.

1348
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,590
Here's your headstone.

1349
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,436
I don't have a vote tonight,

1350
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,606
but if I did, I'd be voting for you, Andy.

1351
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,660
<i>I simply can't trust you.</i>

1352
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,730
I'll go tally the votes.

1353
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,636
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol and you want to play it,

1354
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,690
now would be the time to do so.

1355
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,006
All right.

1356
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,430
I'll read the votes.

1357
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,560
Anika.

1358
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,106
Andy.

1359
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,130
One vote Anika, one vote Andy.

1360
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,606
Anika.

1361
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:23,200
Two votes Anika, one
vote Andy. One vote left.

1362
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,436
Fifth person voted out of survivor 47:

1363
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,566
Anika.

1364
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,260
Need to bring me your torch.

1365
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,436
You're kidding me, you guys.

1366
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,760
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1367
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:48,430
Okay.

1368
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:58,906
Did you know?

1369
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:00,460
I didn't know.

1370
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,530
Who-who owned this?

1371
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,636
There's three of us.

1372
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:13,930
Three votes.

1373
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,490
Anika, the tribe has spoken.

1374
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:37,990
Time for you to go.

1375
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,560
Nah.

1376
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,906
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

1377
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,590
Good night.

my god!

01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,306
<i>Next time on survivor... It's animalistic</i>

1382
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,736
- at this point.
- What a dick.

1383
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,736
<i>I'm fixing to squish him like a bug.</i>

1384
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,106
<i>I'm gonna be feasting on sol's bones.</i>

1385
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,130
I'm on survivor, baby.

1386
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,106
I'm not gonna lie. I'm pretty devastated.

1387
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:53,566
<i>The worst part Is how confident I felt.</i>

1388
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:56,206
<i>I got played before I could play them.</i>

1389
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,936
<i>Yeah, it came to an
end too quickly for me.</i>

1390
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,730
I don't know, I'm just.

1391
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,460
I'm-I'm devastated.
