WENDY LET THE CHICKENS GO.

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,546
SHE KIND OF WENT NUTS.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,148
AT THE KAMA TRIBE, JOE
THOUGHT HE WAS MAKING FRIENDS.

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,584
I FEEL GREAT WITH YOU, BRO.

7

00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,522
I ACTED LIKE I LOVE HIM, BUT
HES A RETURNING PLAYER, AND HE

9
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,723
CAN BE REALLY DANGEROUS.

10
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,626
Jeff: AT THE LESU TRIBE,
DAVID AND DEVON SAW EYE TO EYE.

11
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:30,730

00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,942
I WAS VOTED OUT LAST NIGHT.

24
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,611
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING HOME AND

00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,075
I DIDNT EVEN ASK A QUESTION.

181
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,378
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE STORY THAT
IS UNFOLDING.

182
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,513
ALL RIGHT.

183
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,614
LESU, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

184
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,849
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

185
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:03,549
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

186
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,620
GOD, LIKE HOW BAD CAN WE BE?

187
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,156
YOU HAVE DAVID, WHO BASICALLY
ACTS AS A FEMALE.

188
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,658
I MEAN, HE WEIGHS LESS THAN ME.

189
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,827
BASICALLY WE HAVE THREE GIRLS
AND WARDOG.

190
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:20,900
SO IM JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO, BECAUSE WE CANT WIN

191
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,768
ANYTHING.

192
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,317
ONE, TWO, THREE, KAMA!

193
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,387
WINNING THAT REWARD JUST
SHOWED US ONCE AGAIN THAT THE

194
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,256
KAMA TRIBE IS A FORCE TO BE
RECKONED WITH IN THIS GAME.

195
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,427
WE ARE COMPLETELY DOMINATING AND
WERE ON THIS WINNING STREAK.

196
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,695
LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

197
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,497
YOU GUYS KILLED THAT.

198
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,765
UH-HUH.

199
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,067
HOWEVER, IT IS IN THE BACK OF
MY MIND THAT JOE IS THE BIGGEST

200
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,971
THREAT IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW, SO
I WOULD RATHER GET HIM OUT OF

201
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,274
THIS GAME SOONER RATHER THAN
LATER.

202
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,310
HOW LUCKY ARE WE?

203
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,545
WERE SPOILED.

204
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,714
WERE ALL LOVE AND SUNSHINE
AND SPRINKLES AND RAINBOWS RIGHT

205
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,618
NOW ON KAMA STRONG, BUT ITS
PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT IM A BIG

206
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,888
TARGET AND THAT IM A CHALLENGE
BEAST, SO IT SUCKS.

207
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:20,092
ITS REALLY DIFFICULT TO TRY TO
SHAKE THAT STIGMA.

208
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,095
SO IM JUST TRYING TO DO
ANYTHING I CAN TO MAKE IT

209
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,898
COMFORTABLE FOR MY TRIBE MATES,
MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY NEED ME

210
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:35,975
SO THAT IM NOT THE ONE GOING
HOME.

211
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:41,581
SO THAT IM NOT THE ONE GOING
HOME.

212
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,683
WHERES JOE RIGHT NOW?

213
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,917
AT THE BEACH.

214
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,955
THIS IS LIKE OUR ONE SHOT TO
GET HIM OUT PREMERGE PROBABLY.

215
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,023
JOES DANGEROUS.

216
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:56,395
BUT THERE THREE OF US, IF WE CAN
BLIND SIDE HIM, IT WOULD BE

217
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,196
HUGE.

218
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,965
IM IN A GOOD SITUATION
GAME-WISE.

219
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,501
AND SINCE DAY ONE, I KEPT
TELLING EVERYONE WE HAVE TO GET

220
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:06,539
RID OF JOE, BUT NOW I HAVE
ANOTHER CONSIDERATION.

221
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,807
JOE IS A WORKHORSE.

222
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,077
I MEAN, HE KNOWS EVERYTHING, AND
A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE ON OUR TRIBE

223
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,712
DO NOT.

224
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,246
WERE NOT CATCHING THE FISH.

225
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,682
AND WERE NOT GETTING ALL THE
FOOD.

226
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,752
WE DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

227
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,788
AND SO IM STARTING TO REALIZE,
I DONT LIKE THE THOUGHT OF CAMP

228
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,456
WITHOUT JOE.

229
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,458
I THINK ILL BE MISERABLE.

230
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,427
JOE IS ALLOWING US TO WIN ALL
THESE CHALLENGES SO WE DONT

231
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,229
HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL.

232
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:34,033
IF WE ARE WITHOUT JOE, WERE
PROBABLY GOING TO LOSE THEM.

233
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,535
WE CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT HIM.

234
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,674
WE CANT LET HIM KEEP MAKING A
CASE OF WHY HE SHOULD WIN IF

235
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,141
HES DONE EVERYTHING.

236
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,109
TRUE.

237
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,779
JOE CANNOT GO TOO FAR IN THIS
GAME.

238
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,681
THATS A NO-BRAINER.

239
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,751
AND IM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE
FOUR RETURNING PLAYERS ARE ALL

240
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,519
STILL IN THE GAME.

241
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,756
COME MERGE, HES GOING TO BE
SO HARD TO GET OUT OF THIS GAME.

242
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,358
BUT WHEN HE DOESNT SEE IT
COMING...

243
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,062
IF YOU DONT GET RID OF
RETURNING PLAYERS, BY THE TIME

244
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:07,767
THE MERGE HITS, THEY COULD RUN
AWAY WITH THE WHOLE THING, SO IF

245
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:15,775
WE WERE TO LOSE IMMUNITY, JOE
HAS TO GO NOW.

246
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,844
SO P.B. AND J. POWERS
ACTIVATE.

247
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,048
CHEERS.

248
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,215
READY?

249
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,520
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY, ITS
LIKE A FLAVOR CHANGE, SOME

250
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,421
PROTEIN.

251
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,257
ITS PRETTY GOOD, BUT IM SO
HUNGRY TODAY.

252
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,729
TODAY IS FIRST DAY IM LIKE REAL
HUNGRY.

253
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,863
YEAH.

254
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,033
I FEEL LIKE IF WE CANT FISH,
WE SHOULD EAT A CHICKEN.

255
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:50,276
IF I SEE ONE, ILL GRAB ONE.

256
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,878
WENDY DOESNT WANT US TO EAT THE
CHICKENS.

257
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,579
SO THEYRE FREE RANGE.

258
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,714
THEYRE PART OF THE ISLAND.

259
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,016
AS LONG AS THEY DONT END UP
DEAD.

260
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,252
I FEEL LIKE WORKING WITH
WENDY WOULD BE MORE LIKE

261
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,955
CARRYING AROUND AN ALARM CLOCK,
BUT YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHEN ITS

262
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,859
GOING TO GO OFF, BUT THERE IS AN
ISSUE OF THE RETURNERS.

263
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,962
THE LONGER THEYRE IN THE GAME,
THE MORE DANGEROUS IT GETS.

264
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,998
SO LIKE ALL THINGS IN THIS GAME,
ITS A BALANCING ACT.

265
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,469
LIKE THEYRE GONE AND THEYRE
OUT THERE AND IT BOTHERS ME THAT

266
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,604
THEYRE OUT THERE.

267
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,007
WERE IN THE "SURVIVOR" WAITING
ROOM RIGHT NOW ON THE MANU

268
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,675
TRIBE.

269
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,143
WE HAVENT GONE TO TRIBAL YET.

270
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,846
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED, AND WERE
TALKING ABOUT CHICKENS.

271
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,082
ITS SO FRUSTRATING.

272
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:40,159
LIKE "SURVIVOR," THERE ARE MANY
GHOSTS IN THE JUNGLE IN FIJI.

273
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,460
I AM DYING TO PLAY.

274
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,095
I CAME IN AGGRESSIVE.

275
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,864
I FOUND MY IDOL.

276
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,732
AND I KIND OF SIMMERED DOWN.

277
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,637
NOW WE GOT TO HEAT THE DISH BACK
UP, SO WHAT IM TRYING TO DO IS

278
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,974
FIGURE OUT WHO THE STRATEGISTS
ARE AND FIND MYSELF ONE THAT IS

279
00:12:55,007 --> 00:13:01,046
GOING TO BE ABLE TO WAKE UP FROM
THE KAMA KOOL-AID AND DO

280
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,019
SOMETHING ABOUT EVERYTHING COME
THE MERGE.

281
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:11,023
WOULD YOU RATHER GO INTO THE
MERGE WITH AUBRY OR WITH WENDY?

282
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,760
I THINK ID RATHER GO WITH
WENDY JUST BECAUSE SHES LESS OF

283
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,297
A STRATEGIC THREAT.

284
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,234
WHAT IF I WENT TO AUBRY AND
SAID, DO YOU WANT TO DO A GIRLS

285
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,437
THING, SO IF SHE DOES HAVE AN
IDOL, SHE WOULD LITERALLY NEVER

286
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,505
PLAY HER IDOL.

287
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,475
IT WOULD MAKE ME BELIEVE MORE
IM NOT WITH YOU GUYS.

288
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,611
IT FEELS LIKE THE SAFEST WAY TO
PLACATE AND.

289
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,014
AND THEN SHE WOULD FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE.

290
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,916
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD
DIVERSION.

291
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,320
I THINK WE TELL WENDY, SAY,
LETS JUST TELL HER --

292
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,456
I THINK ITS IN OUR BEST
INTEREST TO GET RID OF AUBRY

293
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,492
FIRST WHEN SHE DOESNT SEE IT
COMING.

294
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:51,130
AS A PERSON, I REALLY LIKE
AUBRY, BUT FOR ME, IT MIGHT

295
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,166
SOUND BO BAD, BUT I HAVE NO
PROBLEM SEPARATING FRIENDSHIPS

296
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,501
FROM THE GAME.

297
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,405
LIKE I DONT REALLY CARE ABOUT
HOW PEOPLE FEEL OUT HERE, BUT

298
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,209
NOW I HAVE TO KEEP AUBRY
THINKING THAT IM ON HER SIDE.

299
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,346
LIKE I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT JEFF
HAS IN STORE, AND EVERYBODY HERE

300
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,150
IS LIKE, I DONT KNOW UNLESS IM
MISSING SOMETHING MAJOR, PEOPLE

301
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,418
ARE REALLY CALM, WHICH IS GOOD.

302
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,554
YEAH, I THINK EVERYONE IS
CALM, BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR BUFFER

303
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:15,855
VOTE.

304
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,989
YEAH.

305
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,059
I THINK SO FOR SURE.Ñi
BUT YOU HAVE SEEN "SURVIVOR."

306
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,961
YOU KNOW ITS LIKE...

307
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,362
NOTHING IS GOING TO BE THIS
EASY.

308
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,730
ITS GOING TO GET WEIRD.

309
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,665
I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHERE YOUR
HEAD WAS AT.

310
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,436
WOULD IT MAKE SENSE WHILE WE
STILL HAVE WENDY, TO DO

311
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:35,174
SOMETHING WITH WENDY, ME AND
YOU, ME YOU AND WENDY.

312
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,375
WE COULD.

313
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:41,180
BECAUSE IF WE GET RID OF LIKE
AN ERIC IN THE NEXT VOTE AND

314
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,381
GAVIN AFTER THAT.

315
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,618
VICTORIA SAID, WE HAVE TO GO
AFTER THE BIG BOYS SOONER OR

316
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,287
LATER, AND I WAS PSYCHED TO HEAR
HER SAY THAT.

317
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,724
I THINK YOURE THE ONLY ONE I
TRUST EVEN A LITTLE BIT RIGHT

318
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,125
NOW.

319
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,295
VICK WAS JUST UNDER MY NOSE.

320
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,930
SHES BEEN SNEAKY THE WHOLE
TIME.

321
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,531
THOSE GLASSES MAY BE BIG.

322
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,069
MAYBE I DIDNT SEE HER EYES
OPEN.

323
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,305
WERE THE MISFITS THAT
COULDNT.

324
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:11,610
OBVIOUSLY THE TRIBE IS IN
NEED OF A SERIOUS PICK-ME-UP.

325
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,246
I WAS THINKING IF YOU AND I WANT
TO TRY TO GO FISHING.

326
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,784
IVE NEVER FISHED BEFORE IN
MY LIFE.

327
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,820
HONESTLY, IM HALF FULL OF RICE.

328
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,788
I HAVE NO CALORIES.

329
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:23,489
OKAY.

330
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,690
THATS FAIR.

331
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:28,894
THIS TRIBE IS SO ON THE EDGE OF
DISTINCTION THAT SCIENTISTS

332
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,561
STOPPED LOOKING FOR US.

333
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,196
THEY ALREADY THINK WERE DEAD.

334
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,301
WERE LIKE THE LAST FOUR DODO
BIRDS LIVING ON A REMOTE ISLAND,

335
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,203
AND I THINK IM NEXT SHOULD WE
LOSE THE NEXT IMMUNITY

336
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:38,837
CHALLENGE.

337
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,340
ILL TRY TO FIND SNAILS.

338
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:46,078
IF I KNOW MY "SURVIVOR" HISTORY
AT ALL, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A

339
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,613
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL ON THE NEW
LESU TRIBE.

340
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,547
FINDING IT IS CRITICAL.

341
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,915
ITS SO FRUSTRATING.

342
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:56,255
BECAUSE I NEED IT BAD.

343
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,625
I LOOK AROUND AT ALL MY PEERS
BACK HOME, AND THEYRE MARRIED

344
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,828
AND THEY HAVE KIDS.

345
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,965
AND ITS SOMETHING THAT KIND OF
ESCAPED ME FOR YEARS.

346
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,266
IM 44 YEARS OLD.

347
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:12,905
ALL I HAVE IS A TWO-BEDROOM
APARTMENT AND SOME D.V.D.s ON

348
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:13,539
A SHELF.

349
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,974
BUT I NEED TO SHAKE THAT.

350
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,810
I NEED TO SHAKE THAT IN MY LIFE
AND I NEED TO SHAKE THAT IN THIS

351
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:18,944
GAME.

352
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,412
IT WASNT UNTIL I PLAYED
"SURVIVOR" THE FIRST TIME THAT I

353
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,983
THINK I REALLY STARTED TO GET UP
OFF THE COUCH AND START LIVING

354
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,184
MY LIFE AGAIN.

355
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,787
ITS TIME TO BUILD ON THAT AND
MOVE FORWARD RATHER THAN JUST

356
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,056
STAY IN THIS ONE SPOT.

357
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,093
SO I ABSOLUTELY WANT THE FIND
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

358
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,128
I KEEP LOOKING AND I KEEP COMING
UP SHORT.

359
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:45,904
BUT I WILL NEVER GIVE UP IN THIS
GAME.

360
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:52,177
HES THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN
EVERY CHALLENGE.

361
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,879
HE CANT GO OFF BY HIMSELF.

362
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,180
WE CANT TRUST HIM.

363
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,816
I HAVE BEEN SO SICK.

364
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,251
LUCKILY WARDOG IS ON MY SIDE.

365
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,619
KELLEY IS ON MY SIDE.

366
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,722
AND I HAVE AN IDOL FROM THE
ORIGINAL MANU.

367
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:09,395
SO IF WE GO TO ANOTHER TRIBAL,
ITS GOING TO BE DAVID.

368
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,129
OKAY.

369
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,096
HERES WHAT IM THINKING.

370
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,264
OKAY.

371
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,035
I THINK THAT ME AND YOU MAKE
THE BEST COMBO POST-MERGE.

372
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,302
I REALLY DO.

373
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,937
ONE MAJOR CONCERN IS A DAVID
IDOL.

374
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:19,571
YES.

375
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,573
OKAY.

376
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,243
THE SECOND MAJOR CONCERN IS IN
THE BECOME OF MY MIND, IF ITS

377
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,379
ME, YOU, AND LAUREN, IM
THINKING THAT LAUREN AND YOU

378
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,181
MIGHT TAKE ME OUT.

379
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,784
AND YOURE THINKING LAUREN AND
ME MIGHT TAKE YOU OUT.

380
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,684
LAUREN JUST HURTS US.

381
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,154
I THINK ME AND YOU VOTE LAUREN
OUT NOW.

382
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,755
WARDOG IS A CRAZY MAN.

383
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:42,094
I THINK HE HAS A LITTLE TONY IN
HIM, BUT IF WE DO LOSE, THAT

384
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,630
SEEMS TO BE A TREND ON THIS
TRIBE, ITS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO

385
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:49,168
HAVE AN A, B, AND C PLAN.

386
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,137
I DO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH LAUREN AND I WANT TO WORK

387
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,741
WITH HER, BUT I FEEL LIKE WARDOG
HAS BEEN TRUTHFUL WITH ME SO

388
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,909
FAR.

389
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,411
HES BEEN THE ONE WHO COMES TO
ME WITH IDEAS, AND DESPERATE

390
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,979
TIMES CALL FOR DESPERATE
MEASURES.

391
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,316
SO I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A GAME
PLAN THATS GOING TO WORK FOR ME

392
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,350
MOVING FORWARD.

393
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:09,321
WE TAKE HER OUT.
 YOURE AN EVIL MASTERMIND.

394
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,357
ITS "SURVIVOR," AND ITS KILL
OR BE KILLED.

395
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:34,947
THERES SOMETHING HERE.

396
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,184
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING THING
THATS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE

397
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:39,718
DAYS.

398
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,120
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

399
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,089
OH, WE HAVE NEWS.

400
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,024
WAKE UP, WAKE UP!

401
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,392
WE HAVE INFORMATION.

402
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,561
WE HAVE NEWS.

403
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,829
ALL RIGHT.

404
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,866
IM GOING TO COLLECT WOOD, AND I
FIND THIS BOX.

405
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,700
OH, MY GOD.

406
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,468
AND ITS GOT SOMETHING FOR EACH
OF US.

407
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,402
FINALLY.

408
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,837
HALLELUJAH.

409
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,907
ON THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION,
YOU HAVE LITERALLY NOTHING SOME

410
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,145
AS SOON AS CHRIS CAME AROUND THE
CORNER WITH THAT BOX,ER KNEW.

411
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,079
I FREAKED.

412
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,114
THIS IS SOMETHING NEW, SOME MORE
INFORMATION.

413
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,084
I WAS LIKE SOME WAY OR SOMEHOW
SOMETHING IS GOING THE HAPPEN IN

414
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:12,885
MY FAVOR.

415
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,052
YOURE ON THE EDGE OF
EXTINCTION.

416
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,622
YOUR GOAL IS TO GET BACK IN THE
FOLD.

417
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,292
IF THE STARS ALIGN, THEYLL
POINT THE WAY.

418
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,794
YOUR GOAL IS TO GET BACK IN
THE FOLD.

419
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,597
IF THE STARS ALIGN, THEYLL
POINT THE WAY.

420
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,832
BACK IN THE FOLD.

421
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:30,169
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FOLD IT SO
THE STARS ALIGN?

422
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,436
WHERE ARE STARS?

423
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,404
ON THE BORDER?

424
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,773
I FIGURED THE MAP OUT REALLY
QUICK.

425
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:38,010
THE STARS ON THE BORDER MATCH UP
WITH EACH OTHER.

426
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:42,581
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT MAKES
THE ARROW POINT RIGHT TO THIS

427
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,117
TREE WITH NO LEAVES.

428
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,886
THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE, THIS
ARROW POINTS RIGHT TO THIS TREE

429
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,621
WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT ROOTS.

430
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,625
SO IT MIGHT BE MY PROUDEST
MOMENT ON "SURVIVOR" SO FAR.

431
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,826
ITS POINTING TO THE TREE.

432
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,896
WERE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A
PACT WE GO ALL TOGETHER.

433
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,263
AM I RIGHT?

434
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,131
I AGREE.

435
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,799
YOU WANT TO HAVE RICE FIRST?

436
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,135
WE MIGHT AS WELL.

437
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:03,769
THATS NOT TO.

438
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,070
RICK FIGURED OUT THE MAP.

439
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:08,106
TO BE HONEST, I WAS NOT GOING TO
FIGURE OUT THAT MAP.

440
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,809
THAT WHOLE FOLDING THE THING
TOGETHER, THAT NEVER WOULD HAVE

441
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:11,276
HAPPENED.

442
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:11,977
THIS IS TASTY.

443
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,145
THIS IS GOOD.

444
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,982
THIS SPOON IS HALF BROKEN,
BUT ITS LIKE MY OWN LITTLE

445
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:17,683
LEFT-HANDED SPOON.

446
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,184
THANK YOU FOR THE RICE, REEM.

447
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,653
ITS GOOD TO HAVE A MOM ON
YOUR TRIBE.

448
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,156
EVERYBODY SAID WERE GOING TO
GO FAIR AND SQUARE.

449
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,157
I WAS LIKE, WHAT?

450
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,059
I WAS LIKE, THATS NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN.

451
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,595
WHERE IS KEITH?

452
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,295
WHERE IS HE?

453
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,030
DID HE HAVE HIS SHOES ON.

454
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,602
KEITH, GET BACK HERE.

455
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:36,935
KEITH?

456
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,904
KEITH!

457
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:43,542
GO DOWN THERE AND SEE IF HES
WALKING DOWN THERE.

458
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,610
IS HE GOING?

459
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,344
YEAH.

460
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,445
HES WAY DOWN THERE.

461
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:46,878
OH, MY GOD.

462
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,879
DID HE GO?

463
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,014
YES, HE WENT.

464
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,215
KEITH, YOU JERK.

465
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,619
DARN IT, THAT IS SO -- YOU
KNOW WHAT, THAT IS

466
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,419
DISAPPOINTING, DUDE.

467
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,254
SHOES ON.

468
00:20:55,287 --> 00:21:03,962
WOW, KEITH, WHAT AN --
 HURRY UP.

469
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:04,930
YOU GUYS HAVE THE MAP?

470
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:05,631
YES.

471
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,299
WERE COMING FOR YOU, KEITH.

472
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:12,471
WHAT A GUY.

473
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,207
THE PATH IS GOING TO SPLIT,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

474
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,645
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY WE VOTED
HIM OUT.

475
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,113
KEITH!

476
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,347
I GOT TO FIND IT.

477
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,448
I GOT TO FIND IT.

478
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,917
COME ON, GOD, COME ON, GOD, COME
ON, GOD.

479
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,019
IS HE THERE?

480
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,288
WHAT THE HELL, KEITH?

481
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,056
THIS IS FOR FAMILY.

482
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,024
ITS NOT FOR CHRIS.

483
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,892
ITS NOT FOR REEM.

484
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,395
KEITH, YOU DOG.

485
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:42,067
YOU GOT HIM.

486
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,568
NOT COOL.

487
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,736
YOU GOT IT, CHRIS?

488
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,839
YES.

489
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,174
I LOOK IN THE TREE.

490
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,843
I PULL OUT THREE BAMBOO RODS.

491
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,313
THERES STRING ATTACHED TO THESE
RODS.

492
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,249
AND THERES A NOTE.

493
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,750
PRACTICE.

494
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,152
IT SAYS PRACTICE ON IT.

495
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,121
THIS IS THE FIRST EXCITING CLUE
TO WHAT WERE GOING TO BE DOING

496
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,423
NEXT.

497
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,059
MY GUESS, ITS GOT TO BE
SOMETHING YOU PRACTICE WITH TO

498
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,595
GET BACK INTO THE GAME.

499
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,797
MY MOVE IS TO BE THAT PERSON.

500
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,467
RICK, WHY DID I FOLD THAT MAP
RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY?

501
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,769
CHRIS, YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME,
RIGHT?

502
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:18,270
YES.

503
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:18,970
I GOT IT.

504
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,539
CHRIS RAN TO ONE TREE.

505
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:21,306
I RAN TO THE OTHER.

506
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,941
WE HAD THE ADVANTAGES IN OUR
HANDS.

507
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,411
YOU HAVE EARNED THE RIGHT TO
GIVE THIS EXTRA VOTE TO ANY

508
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,814
PLAYER HEADING NOT NEXT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

509
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,782
THEY WILL NOT KNOW IT IS FROM
YOU.

510
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,017
CHOOSE WISELY.

511
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,355
SO I FOUND AN ADVANTAGE THEY
CAN GIVE ONE PERSON HEADING TO

512
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,056
TRIBAL COUNCIL AN EXTRA VOTE.

513
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,259
WHOEVER GETS THIS VOTE, THEY
HAVE NO IDEA THE EDGE OF

514
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,160
EXTINCTION EXISTS.

515
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,096
THATS PRETTY GOOD FOR
WHOEVER GETS IT.

516
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,265
IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL THAT
WERE ON THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION,

517
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:52,304
BUT WERE NOT OUT OF THE GAME,
SO IM PLAYING OUT HERE NOW.

518
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,684
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

519
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,487
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAYS
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

520
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,621
YEAH.

521
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,491
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST, I
GOT TO TAKE BACK THE IDOL.

522
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,024
OH.

523
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,859
Jeff: SORRY.

524
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,293

ITS A HUGE TIME ADVANTAGE OVER
LESU.

599
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,079
HERE COMES KAMA.

600
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,616
THIS IS THE KIND OF PUZZLE YOU
COULD SOLVE VERY FAST AS THERE

601
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,484
ARE ONLY FOUR PIECES.

602
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,518
BUT IT WILL FOOL YOU.

603
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,087
WE CANT DO IT THAT WAY.

604
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,457
Jeff: MANU AND KAMA

605
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,526
ADVANTAGE THEY HAVE IS TWO
TRIBES WILL WIN IMMUNITY, AND

606
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,033
RIGHT NOW ONE TRIBE IS DOING
NOTHING.

607
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,234
LAUREN NOW GOING TO GIVE UP.

608
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,502
SHES HEADING BACK.

609
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:23,008
THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
BLOWOUTS IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

610
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,979
ONCE AGAIN LESU WITH LAUREN,
WENTWORTH, WARDOG AND DAVID HAVE

611
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,781
BEEN THROUGH EVERY SINGLE
TRIBAL.

612
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,151
RIGHT NOW THAT APPEARS TO BE A
STREAK THAT WILL REMAIN INTACT

613
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:37,756
AS THEY HAVE NONE OF THEIR
PUZZLE PIECES WHILE BOTH OTHER

614
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,925
TRIBES ARE ALREADY SOLVING.

615
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:41,893
RIGHT THERE.

616
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:42,961
SEE THAT?

617
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,031
Jeff: THERES ONLY FOUR
PIECES, BUT IT CAN BE VERY

618
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,198
DIFFICULT.

619
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:56,675
UNTIL YOU FIGURE IT OUT, AND
THEN IT WILL SOLVE INSTANTLY.

620
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,376
WARDOG CANT GET IT EITHER.

621
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:03,214
WENTWORTH IN DESPAIR ONCE AGAIN.

622
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:07,652
SHE SEES THE CHALLENGE SLIPPING
AWAY.

623
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,721
WARDOG POPS THE FIRST PUZZLE
PIECE FOR LESU.

624
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,390
THERE IS LIFE FOR LESU AFTER
ALL.

625
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,292
DAVID, YOU CAN DO IT!

626
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,127
Jeff: NOW DAVID IN THE
WATER.

627
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,730
A CHANCE FOR DAVID TO SHINE IN
AN ENVIRONMENT HE REALLY

628
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,899
STRUGGLES IN, THE OCEAN.

629
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,233
COME ON, DAVID.

630
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,270
Jeff: DAVIDS GOT TO GET
DOWN AND RELEASE IT, DAVID.

631
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:28,807
LETS GO!

632
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,278
THE GOOD NEWS IS MANU AND KAMA
HAVE NOT SOLVED THE PUZZLE, SO

633
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:39,884
THAT DOOR IS STILL TECHNICALLY
OPEN FOR LESU.

634
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,720
DAVID, COME ON.

635
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,488
COME TO THE PONTOON, IM GOING
TO GO.

636
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,825
Jeff: DAVID GOING TO GIVE
UP AND SWIM BACK TO THE PONTOON.

637
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,060
SOMEBODY FROM THAT FOUR WILL
HAVE TO GO BACK.

638
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,929
LESU IS NOT A TRIBE THATS
QUICK.

639
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,364
THEYRE JUST A TRIBE HAVING A
VERY TOUGH TIME WINNING.

640
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,532
GET OUT OF THE WATER.

641
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,203
Jeff: LAUREN GOES BACK DOWN
YET AGAIN FOR ANOTHER TRY.

642
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,738
IS THIS THE ONE?

643
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,372
IM GOING TO GET IT.

644
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,073
IM GOING TO GET IT.

645
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,308
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

646
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:07,479
YOU GOT THIS.

647
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,146
YES!

648
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,215
Jeff: AND SHE DOES IT.

649
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,851
LAUREN FREES THAT SECOND PIECE
FOR LESU.

650
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,419
TELL ME WHEN YOURE READY.

651
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,653
Jeff: UNCLIP.

652
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,321
START PULLING.

653
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,757
HERE COMES LESU NOW.

654
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,924
WE GOT A CHALLENGE.

655
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,259
PULL, GUYS, PULL.

656
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,395
Jeff: MANU AND KAMA HAVE
HAD A LONG TIME TO EXPERIMENT ON

657
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,797
THIS PUZZLE.

658
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,232
BUT IT HAS RESULTED IN NOTHING.

659
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,067
I HATE PUZZLES.

660
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,803
Jeff: IF LESU COULD PULL
THIS CHALLENGE OUT, IT WOULD BE

661
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:37,542
ONE OF THE GREATEST COMEBACKS IN
THE HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR".

662
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,111
LETS GO, LESU!

663
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,748
VICTORY HERE WOULD BE A MAJOR
WIN.

664
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,816
THIS ONE.

665
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:45,250
NO.

666
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:45,750
OKAY.

667
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,621
NO.

668
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,388
YES.

669
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,024
Jeff: KAMA THINKS THEY HAVE
IT.

670
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,692
PULL THAT UP.

671
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:55,393
Jeff: AND THAT DO.

672
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,394
JOE IS RIGHT.

673
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,563
KAMA WINS IMMUNITY ONCE AGAIN.

674
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:03,935
WERE LOOKING FOR ONE MORE.

675
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,303
FOUR ON THE BOTTOM.

676
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,104
QUICK, QUICK.

677
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,238
Jeff: MANU IS AMPED UP.

678
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,174
GUYS, WERE SO CLOSE, GUYS.

679
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,041
YEAH, YEAH.

680
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,510
Jeff: WHO IS GOING TO GET
THERE FIRST?

681
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,945
WILL IT BE MANU OR LESU?

682
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,547
THIS IS GOING TO GO HERE.

683
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,248
THIS IS GOING TO GO RIGHT HERE.

684
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:17,715
RIGHT THERE.

685
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,550
IS THAT IT?

686
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,651
THAT MIGHT BE IT.

687
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,585
Jeff: PUT THAT THERE.

688
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,453
PUT THAT THERE.

689
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,922
DAVID TRYING SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

690
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:24,856
LESU THINKS THEY HAVE IT.

691
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,192
IF THEY HAVE IT, IT WOULD BE
THEIR FIRST WIN.

692
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,693
AND IT IS!

693
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:33,898
LESU WINS IMMUNITY SENDING MANU
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

694
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:34,833
YES!

695
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:35,500
YES!

696
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,435
OH, MY GOD.

697
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,237
OH, MY GOD, GUYS.

698
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,538
OH, MY GOD.

699
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,272
GUYS, GUYS.

700
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,273
OH, MY GOD.

701
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:42,907
OH, MY GOD.

702
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,442
ARE YOU OKAY?

703
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,444
OH, MY GOD.

704
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:50,348
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

705
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,851
Jeff: KAMA, A FAMILIAR
STORY.

706
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,320
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

707
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,354
THANK YOU, JEFF.

708
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,488
Jeff: SWIM OUT.

709
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:04,295
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

710
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:09,067
LESU, YOUR FIRST IMMUNITY WIN.

711
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,204
FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON
DAVID, LAUREN, WENTWORTH,

712
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:17,175
WARDOG, I WILL NOT BE SEEING YOU
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

713
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,042
SWIM OUT.

714
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:27,318
ENJOY THE CELEBRATION AND THE
NIGHT OFF.

715
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,555
MANU, SOMEBODY GOING HOME
TONIGHT.

716
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,322
SWIM OUT.

717
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,523
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

718
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,692
RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE A COMMON
GOAL.

719
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,160
WE ALL THINK AUBRY NEEDS TO GO.

720
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,430
BUT I STILL THINK WE ARE MAKING
A BIG MOVE, AND BIG MOVES ARE

721
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,698
ALWAYS RISKY.

722
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,769
SO IM GOING TO PICK AND CHOOSE
MY WORDS CAREFULLY TO NOT OVEROR

723
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:48,806
UNDER EXPOSE WHATS REALLY
HAPPENING.

724
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,624
SORRY WE COULDNT PULL IT
OUT, GUYS.

725
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,659
MAN.

726
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,928
GOING TO TRIBAL, I KNOW THE
DRILL.

727
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:14,198
IT WAS ALMOST SURREAL COMING
BACK FROM LOSING THE CHALLENGE,

728
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:19,037
BECAUSE THE FOUR ORIGINAL KAMA
CAME TOGETHER, AND IT JUST

729
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,638
SEEMED SO EASY.

730
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,641
RIGHT NOW WE NEED THIS FOUR
TO GO FURTHER.

731
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:24,742
I KNOW.

732
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:29,847
LIKE WE NEED THIS TO FURTHER
OURSELVES IN THE GAME.

733
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,283
WERE GOING TO FORGE THIS
FOUR.

734
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,217
PERFECT.

735
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,953
-PLAN IS TO VOTED OUT WENDY.

736
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,957
BUT I WAS TALKING TO VICTORIA
YESTERDAY, AND SHE SAID DO WE GO

737
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,359
FOR ONE OF THE BIG GUYS RIGHT
NOW?

738
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,796
I CAN TELL YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING.

739
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,798
DONT WANT TO MISS THE
MOMENT.

740
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,967
NO.

741
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,468
IM 1,000% DOWN WITH YOU.

742
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,204
THE ADVANTAGE TO DOING IT NOW
IS WE HAVE NUMBERS.

743
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:56,240
I THINK WENDY WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO SAVE HERSELF, YOU

744
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:56,908
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

745
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,109
YEAH, I KNOW.

746
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:03,381
HAVING WENDY RIGHT NOW IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING.

747
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,817
THERE ARE THREE GIRL, TWO GUYS,.

748
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,552
I KNOW VICK ANDRY GOOD RIGHT
NOW.

749
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:12,323
WE COULD KILL ERIC OFF
TONIGHT.

750
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,226
ID LIKE TO MAKE A MOVE.

751
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,229
YOUVE SEEN ME PLAY.

752
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,465
THAT HAS BEEN RUNNING THROUGH MY
MIND FOR DAYS.

753
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,632
ITS ALL TIMING.

754
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,634
WE DO THAT NOW WE COULD BE
SHOOTING OURSELVES IN THE FOOT.

755
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,604
WE WEIGHED THE PROS AND CONS
DO.

756
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:31,342
WE WORK WITH WENDY AND TAKE OUT
AN ERIC OR A GAVIN.

757
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,111
ERIC IS GOING TO BE A THREAT AT
THE MERGE.

758
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,647
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET HIM
OUT PHYSICALLY.

759
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,617
DO WE TAKE OUR HIT WHILE WE HAVE
WENDY.

760
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,953
WHAT KIND OF GAME DID YOU COME
IN HOPING TO PLAY?

761
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,022
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY WITH?

762
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,156
PLAY WITH?

763
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:52,830
YEAH, LIKE, I MEAN, WE COULD
GO FOR ONE OF THE BOYS.

764
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,101
IF THATS SOMETHING YOURE
INTERESTED IN.

765
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,372
LIKE IF YOU GUYS SAY, YEAH,
AND I SAY NEW YORK ITS NOT

766
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,074
LIKE --
 WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

767
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,143
LIKE THAT, IT WOULD BE NOW.

768
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:12,717
BECAUSE THERES THREE OF US,
RIGHT?

769
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,819
WE HAVE THE THINK ON IT.

770
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,355
WENDY CANT MAKE A DECISION.

771
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,225
IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO
GET EVEN AN OPINION OUT OF HER.

772
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:26,330
AND IF YOU CANT GIVE AN OPINION
WHEN YOURE NECK IS ON THE LINE

773
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,734
AND ITS FOUR ORIGINAL TRIBE
MATES AGAINST YOU, I DONT KNOW

774
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:36,707
HOW I CAN WORK WITH YOU FOR THE
REST OF THE GAME.

775
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,745
THE DECISION FOR ME IS A BIG
DECISION, BECAUSE IT IS FORGING

776
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,247
AN ALLIANCE FOR ME, BUT NOBODY
HAS SEEN ANY GAME YET.

777
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,149
WERE GOOD?

778
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:48,286
I DONT KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE
ARE AS PLAYERS SOME THE IDOL IS

779
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,923
ALWAYS FACTOR FOR ME, AND IM
WALKING AROUND WITH MY BAG,

780
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:56,327
MAKING SURE I GOT A GOOD LITTLE
SPOT FOR MY HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

781
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:07,238
TO NESTLE BEFORE GOING TO
TRIBAL, AND THERES AN ENVELOPE.

782
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,874
SOMEONE HAS SENT YOU THE
ADVANTAGE IN THE FORM OF A

783
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,075
SECRET EXTRA VOTE.

784
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,746
WHEN ITS TIME TO VOTE, USE THE
PARCHMENT TO CAST THE SECOND

785
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,881
VOTE.

786
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:20,451
IF YOURE CLEVER, NOBODY ELSE
WILL KNOW YOU VOTED TWICE.

787
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,021
THE LAST TIME THIS VOTE CAN BE
USED WHEN THERE ARE SEVEN PEOPLE

788
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:24,956
LEFT IN THE GAME.

789
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:30,528
THE EXTRA VOTE EXTENDS TO A TIE
AND REVOTE.

790
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,729
OH, MY GOSH.

791
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:35,299
SOMEONE IN THE GAME IS LOOKING
OUT FOR ME, AND I WANT TO KNOW

792
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,834
WHO IT IS.

793
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,003
BECAUSE THATS SOMEONE WHO IS ON
MY SIDE.

794
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,671
THIS EXTRA VOTE CHANGES
EVERYTHING.

795
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:44,342
I MEAN, DO I USE IT NOW AND
KNOCK OUT ERIC?

796
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:50,081
OR DO I SAVE IT POST-MERGE AND
USE IT WHEN THE NUMBERS GET

797
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,983
FUNKY?

798
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:56,154
ITS ABOUT TO GET REAL.

799
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,456
IM NOT GOOD WITH POWER
STUFF.

800
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,091
IM USED TO PLAYING FROM BEHIND.

801
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,060
I DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAY WHEN I
HAVE CARDS IN MY HAND.

802
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,630
WHEN I HAVE THE ROYAL FLUSH, I
DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL TO DO.

803
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,132
I HAVE ALLIANCES STARTING.

804
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,637
I FEEL GOOD WITH VICK, BUT I
ALMOST DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO

805
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,007
WHEN SOMETHING SOMEWHAT POSITIVE
HAPPENS IN THIS GAME.

806
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,544
LIKE I HAVE CHOICES TO MAKE WITH
BIG THINGS, AND I FEEL LIKE THAT

807
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,513
MEANS IM GOING TO BE VOTED OUT
TONIGHT.

808
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:26,284
BUT MAYBE THATS NOT THE
MENTALITY TO HAVE.

809
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:30,221
EVERY TIME I TRY TO DO SOMETHING
IN "SURVIVOR," SOMETHING GOES

810
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,157
WRONG, LIKE MAYBE I HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE FAITH THAT MAYBE JUST A

811
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,195
LITTLE BITTY THING CAN GO RIGHT.

812
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,158
Jeff: IF YOU DONT YET HAVE
A TORCH, GRAB ONE WE HIDE YOU,

813
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:15,266
DIP IT IN, AND GET FIRE.

814
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,069
PART OF THE RITUAL AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS GAME,

815
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,771
FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

816
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:26,043
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO
ARE YOU.

817
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,680
SO, DWAFFEN, YOU CAN OFTEN GET
SCENES OF HOW TRIBAL WILL GO

818
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:33,017
BASED ON THE MOOD OF THE TRIBE
RIGHT AFTER YOU GET BACK TO CAMP

819
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,952
FROM LOSING A CHALLENGE.

820
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,355
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GUYS GOT
BACK?

821
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,992
THE MOOD WAS PRETTY DANG
RELAXED WHENEVER WE GOT BACK.

822
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,294
SO IM CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT
TONIGHT HOLDS.

823
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,496
Jeff: AUBRY, DOES THAT MEAN
NOBODY TALKED?

824
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:46,998
EVERYBODY JUST KNEW WHAT WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN?

825
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,699
ABSOLUTELY NOT, JEFF.

826
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:52,169
EVERYONE IS ALWAYS TALKING INCH
THIS GAME YOU HAVE TO BE A TALK

827
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,405
AHEAD, OTHERWISE YOURE OUT
BEFORE YOU EVEN REALIZE.

828
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,642
Jeff: VICTORIA, AUBRY SAYS,
YEAH, THERE WAS TALKING.

829
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,677
AUBRYS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

830
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,013
THERE WERE DEFINITELY
CONVERSATIONS THAT I WAS IN.

831
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,950
IM JUST HOPING THAT EVERYONE
DIDNT GET INTO THEIR OWN HEADS.

832
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:09,553
Jeff: SO WENDY, YOURE AN
OBVIOUS CONSIDERATION TONIGHT

833
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,590
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THESE
FOUR HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FROM THE

834
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:12,890
BEGINNING.

835
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,525
YES.

836
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,359
1,000%.

837
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,595
Jeff: AND YET YOURE STILL
SMILING.

838
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,765
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE MORE
CONFUSED THAN ANYTHING ABOUT MY

839
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,799
GAME PLAY.

840
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,468
THEYRE JUST LIKE, WHO PLAYS THE
WAY YOU DO, RIGHT?

841
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,872
BUT I DONTÑi KNOW, I JUST FEEL
LIKE IF I WERE TO WALK DOWN AND

842
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:31,976
GET MY TORCH SNUFFED, WHY BE SAD
ABOUT THAT?

843
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,144
I MADE IT HERE.

844
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,913
Jeff: AUBRY, ONE OF THE
MOST BRUTAL PARTS OF "SURVIVOR"

845
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,216
IS THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY IS
TYPICALLY ON THE BOTTOM.

846
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,386
BUT IF YOURE WITH A GROUP OF
FOUR AND THERES A FIFTH, DOES

847
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,288
IT SHIFT THAT DYNAMIC A LITTLE
BIT?

848
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,826
I THINK EVERYONE IS TRYING TO
SUSS OUT MORE THAN JUST THEIR

849
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,295
ALLIANCES, LIKE WHO DO THEY
CONNECT WITH ON A GAME LEVEL,

850
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,364
WHO SPEAKS THE SAME LANGUAGE IN
THE GAME.

851
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:57,902
WHEN YOU FIND A BLACK CAT TO
YOUR WITCH IN "SURVIVOR: EDGE OF

852
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,771
EXTINCTION," ITS A PERFECT
HALLOWEEN NIGHT.

853
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:05,142
ITS LIKE HOCUS-POCUS,
ABRACADABRA, YOU CAN FIND THAT

854
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,377
PERSON AT ANY POINT.

855
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,045
Jeff: HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR
BLACK CAT?

856
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,782
IM HOPING I FOUND MY BLACK
CAT OR MY BLACK CATS.

857
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,352
Jeff: GAVIN, THE OTHER
THING THAT STICKS OUT IN THIS

858
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:17,888
GROUP OF FIVE IS AUBRY, THE ONLY
RETURNING PLAYER IN THIS GROUP.

859
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,490
WHATS A POSITIVE OF HAVING
AUBRY?

860
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,026
I THINK SHES BROUGHT ADVICE.

861
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,562
THATS ONE OF THE BIG THINGS FOR
US, AND I THINK ME AND AUBRY

862
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,297
HAVE CONNECTED ON A PERSONAL
LEVEL.

863
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,467
I DONT SEE HER AS A RETURNING
PLAYER AS MUCH AS SOMEONE THAT I

864
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,768
CAN TRUST DOWN THE ROAD.

865
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,904
THATS ONE OF THE REASONS I WAS
ATTRACTED TO HER FROM THE

866
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,272
GET-GO.

867
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,908
Jeff: SO WENDY, EXPERIENCE
IS A POSITIVE THAT AUBRY BRINGS.

868
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,009
WHATS A NEGATIVE?

869
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:43,681
WELL, I DONT THINK AUBRY
BRINGS ANY NEGATIVES.

870
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,182
SHES JUST THE NICEST PERSON
EVER.

871
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,186
Jeff: WENDY, IS IT HARD FOR
YOU TO SEPARATE THE GAME FROM

872
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,487
PERSONAL?

873
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,688
YEAH.

874
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,358
ITS HARD TRANSITION BETWEEN
NORMAL LIFE TO THIS GAME THAT IS

875
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,061
JUST LIKE YOU HAVE TO JUST DROP
ALL YOUR MORALS DOWN.

876
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,629
I FOUND THE TRANSITION VERY
HARD.

877
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,899
I DONT THINK I HAVE MADE IT
COMPLETELY YET.

878
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,102
Jeff: SO GAVIN, WHERE ARE
WE IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW WITH

879
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,303
THIS GROUP?

880
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,274
I THINK US FOUR, WERE JUST
GETTING STARTED UP THE ROLLER

881
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,475
COASTER.

882
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,944
WENDY HAS ALREADY WENT DOWN A
COUPLE HILLS AND SHE SURVIVED,

883
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:18,048
BUT IM BASING MY VOTE OFF WHO I
THINK IS GOING TO BENEFIT ME THE

884
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,085
MOST AND WHO HAS MY BACK FOR THE
DAYS TO COME.

885
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,220
Jeff: ERIC, DO YOU GEE WITH
THAT?

886
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,557
YEAH, I KNOW IVE HAD MOMENTS
WHERE I THOUGHT, AM I GETTING

887
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,258
DUPED TONIGHT?

888
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,360
COULD THIS BE HOW MY GAME ENDS?

889
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,563
BUT AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO
TRUST THE PEOPLE THAT YOU TRUST,

890
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,199
AND I THINK WELL FORGE IT IN
FIRE TONIGHT.

891
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,936
Jeff: AUBRY, THIS MAY BE A
CASE WHERE IT IS A VERY EASY

892
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:39,570
VOTE.

893
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,305
NO SURPRISE, NO BLIND SIDES?

894
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,842
I CAN SOMETIMES BE AN
OVERTHINKER, BUT SOMETIMES

895
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:49,914
THINGS ARE MORE SIMPLE THAN THEY
SEEM.

896
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,081
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

897
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,217
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

898
00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:03,828
WENDY, YOURE UP.

899
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:37,661
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

900
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,331
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

901
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:46,770
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

902
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:47,605
OKAY.

903
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:53,511
ILL READ THE VOTES.

904
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:58,582

00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:05,122
ONE VOTE AUBRY, ONE VOTE WENDY.

907
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,023

00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:13,097
THATS TWO VOTES AUBRY, ONE VOTE
WENDY.

909
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,034
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR," AUBRY.

910
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,704
THATS THREE, THATS ENOUGH.

911
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:24,508
YOU GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE
PLAYERS.

912
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,277
Jeff: YOU NEED TO BRING ME
YOUR TORCH.

913
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,645
WOW.

914
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,880
WOW.

915
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:39,590
DAMN.

916
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:44,261
Jeff: AUBRY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

917
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,162
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

918
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,831
THANKS, AUB.

919
00:42:47,865 --> 00:43:01,278

920
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,458
WOW.

921
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:19,997
OH, THATS AN EASY DECISION.

922
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:27,004
NO-BRAINER.

923
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,388
I WOKE UP AND NONE OF THIS IS A
DREAM.

924
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,557
I GOT BURNED REAL HARD LAST
NIGHT.

925
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:51,228
I TRULY WAS BLIND SIDED IN EPIC
FASHION WITH AN IDOL AND AN

926
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,796
EXTRA VOTE IN MY POCKET.

927
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,333
LIKE J.T.-STYLE EMBARRASSMENT.

928
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,870
I AM COMPLETELY IN AN UTTER
STATE OF SHOCK.

929
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,773
AND ITS HARD TO KNOW HOW TO
PLAY WHEN YOU DONT EVEN KNOW

930
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,874
WHAT THE ENDING IS.

931
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,909
YOU DONT HAVE INFORMATION.

932
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,647
YOURE WITH ANGRY PEOPLE, AND
YOU DONT KNOW IF YOURE PLAYING

933
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,652
A GAME OR IN A BIG WAITING ROOM,
BUT I NEVER GIVE UP.

934
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,288
FOR ME AS SOON AS IT HITS THE
ROCK BOTTOM, THATS MY FAVORITE

935
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,426
PART, BECAUSE I KNOW IT CAN ONLY
GO UP.

936
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:26,096
I THRIVE ON PULLING MYSELF UP
FROM THE BOTTOM, AND THATS WHAT

937
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,334
IM GOING TO DO.

938
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:45,916
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

Jeff: "SURVIVOR" IS TOUGH,
MAN.

1045
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:04,648
NOWHERE TO HIDE.

1046
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,782
WRONG WAY.

1047
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:12,856
Jeff: IF YOU NEVER THREW A
BANAL, ITS GOING TO SHOW.

1048
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,957
LETS GO, JOE.

1049
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:14,725
YOU GOT THIS.

1050
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:15,792
Jeff: JOE WITH ANOTHER HIT.

1051
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:16,894
NAILING IT, JOE.

1052
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,161
Jeff: AND ANOTHER.

1053
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:18,962
AND ANOTHER.

1054
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,165
JOE IS ON FIRE.

1055
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,201
LETS GO, JOE!

1056
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,235
GOOD JOB.

1057
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,404
Jeff: GAVIN NOW STARTING TO
GET THE HANG OF IT.

1058
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,272
GOOD JOB.

1059
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,007
THAT ONE ON THE RIGHT.

1060
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,475
YES, JOE.

1061
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,342
YES.

1062
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,912
Jeff: JOE DROPS FIRST FLAG
FOR KAMA.

1063
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,314
GAVIN DROPS THE FIRSTING FROM
FOR MANU.

1064
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:42,286
LAUREN NOW IN FOR LESU.

1065
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,388
YES, LAUREN!

1066
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,123
Jeff: LAUREN TRYING TO KEEP
LESU IN IT.

1067
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,257
KEEP GOING, LAUREN.

1068
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,660
Jeff: BUT ITS A SHOWDOWN
RIGHT NOW BETWEEN GAVE INANE

1069
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:53,363
JOE.

1070
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,731
ONE MORE, ONE MORE.

1071
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,667
Jeff: JOE VERY CLOSE.

1072
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,202
YOU GOT IT.

1073
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,737
Jeff: THAT DOES IT.

1074
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,306
KAMA WINS YET AGAIN.

1075
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,774
A BIG REWARD.

1076
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,842
WE ARE LOOKING FOR ONE MORE.

1077
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,211
LAUREN TRYING TO KEEP LESU IN
IT.

1078
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,479
SOMEONE WANT TO GO?

1079
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,647
I CAN COME IN.

1080
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,115
I CAN COME IN.

1081
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,016
ITS UP TO YOU.

1082
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,218
Jeff: ITS GOING TO BE
WARDOG BACK IN.

1083
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,954
HE WAS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE.

1084
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,288
COME ON, TRY IT.

1085
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,291
Jeff: GAVIN CAN DO IT WITH
THIS TOSS RIGHT HERE.

1086
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,359
SLOW DOWN.

1087
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,927
YOU GOT TIME.

1088
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,630
Jeff: GAVIN DOES IT FOR
MANU.

1089
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:32,069
MANU WINS REWARD SENDING LESU
BACK TO CAMP WITH ABSOLUTELY

1090
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:40,143
NOTHING.

1091
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,144
ALL RIGHT.

1092
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,245
KAMA, THE WINNING STREAK STAYS
ALIVE.

1093
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,514
VICTORIES IN SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT
CHALLENGES.

1094
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:45,482
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1095
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:50,287
HEAD BACK TO CAMP, AND ENJOY
YOUR REWARD.

1096
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,556
MANU, SECOND CASE, NOT QUITE AS
MUCH, BUT IN THIS CASE, ANY

1097
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:53,657
VICTORY IS SWEET.

1098
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,993
COOKIES AND ICED COFFEE WAITING
FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

1099
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,428
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, ENJOY.

1100
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,897
LESU, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

1101
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:05,902
I THINK THE KAMA TRIBE IS ON
JOES SHOULDERS.

1102
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:07,337
THE DUDE WINS EVERYTHING.

1103
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:11,708
IM JUST JEALOUS ANOTHER TRIBE
HAS BASICALLY HAD A TWO-WEEK

1104
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:12,909
VACATION.

1105
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:16,980
ITS JUST SO FRUSTRATING THAT I
WANT, THAT AND I DONT HAVE

1106
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:21,018
THAT, AND THERES NOTHING I CAN
DO ABOUT IT.

1107
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,097
OH, MY GOD.

1108
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:34,865
OH, MY GOD.

1109
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:35,832
EVERYTHING YOU WANTED AND
MORE?

1110
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,436
OH, MY GOD.

1111
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,904
KAMA STRONG!

1112
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:44,441
IT FEELS A LITTLE BIT AT THIS
POINT LIKE IM EXPECTING THAT WE

1113
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,842
WILL WIN THE CHALLENGES.

1114
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,546
AND I KNOW I SHOULDNT EXPECT
THAT, BUT ITS HARD TO EVEN

1115
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,983
IMAGINE US LOSING AT THIS POINT.

1116
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,619
JOE, YOU WON THAT CHALLENGE FOR
US.

1117
00:50:55,652 --> 00:51:00,057
I JUST WORRY THAT ITS GOING
TO PUT A BIGGER TARGET ON MY

1118
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,126
BACK, SO IM GOING TO FEED YOU
ALL TO PROTECT ME EVEN MORE.

1119
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,263
IM APPRECIATING THIS RIGHT
NOW AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW

1120
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,631
MUCH I APPRECIATE THIS.

1121
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:11,334
AT THIS POINT, IM PULLING THE
WOOL OVER JOES EYES.

1122
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,869
HES THE BIGGEST TARGET IN THIS
GAME.

1123
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,104
HE KNOWS HE IS.

1124
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:18,141
AND I KEEP JUST PRETENDING THAT
IM GOING ALONG WITH HIM, BUT

1125
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:22,779
SHORT TERM TO HAVE JOE ON OUR
TRIBE RIGHT NOW IS A HUGE

1126
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:23,914
BENEFIT.

1127
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,982
SO AUBRY, I THINK THEY SAW
THE MERGE COMING AND THEY

1128
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,117
DECIDED TO TAKE OUT A RETURNING.

1129
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,619
IT BROKE MY HEART A LITTLE TO
WATCH AUBRY GO.

1130
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:34,424
SEEING AUBRY GO HOME, IT WAS
DEFINITELY A TELLTALE SIGN THAT

1131
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:40,363
THESE NEW PLAYERS ARE SEEING US
RETURN-IES AS THREATS.

1132
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,866
STRATEGICALLY THAT REALLY HURT
MY GAME, BECAUSE I FELL LIKE I

1133
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,101
COULD REALLY TRUST HER.

1134
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,837
ITS REALLY HARD WHEN YOU WANT
TO COME BACK AND PLAY THIS GAME

1135
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,875
THAT YOU LOVE SO BADLY, BUT YOU
ALSO KNOW THAT YOURE AT A

1136
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,077
DISADVANTAGE AS SOON AS YOU HIT
THE MAT.

1137
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,645
YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO HIDE.

1138
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:03,787
YOU HAVE NO... YOU GOT NO ONE TO
RELY ON.

1139
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,857
YOU DONT.

1140
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:11,328
BUT IT MAKES YOU APPRECIATE ALL
THE PEOPLE YOU DO RELY ON AT

1141
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:16,233
HOME.

1142
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:20,670
IM SO BLESSED TO HAVE SO MUCH
LOVE, AND I APPRECIATE ALL MY

1143
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,005
PEOPLE, MY FAMILY.

1144
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,775
YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT AND
YOU HAVE TO USE IT AS FUEL.

1145
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,179
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN
YOU THINK YOURE GOING HOME,

1146
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:33,817
WHEN YOU THINK YOURE OUT ON THE
OUTS, WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE NO

1147
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,988
ONE THAT WANTS TO WORK WITH YOU,
THATS THE CHALLENGE IS TO HOW

1148
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,189
ADAPTABLE ARE YOU REALLY?

1149
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:42,893
HOW MUCH CAN YOU GO BEYOND WHAT
YOU THINK YOURE CAPABLE OF?

1150
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:46,863
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A MINDSET
WHERE YOU NO LONGER HAVE

1151
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:50,100
OPTIONS, THEN THATS PROBABLY
WHERE YOURE AT.

1152
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,602
AND I DONT WANT TO BE THERE.

1153
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,538
I LIKE TO DO WELL IN CHALLENGES.

1154
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,607
BUT WE HAVE TO BE SUPER CAREFUL.

1155
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,609
ITS GOING TO BE EASIER TO PUT
TARGETS ON US.

1156
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:03,480
DO YOU THINK THERES BAD
BLOOD ON THEIR SIDE THAT WERE

1157
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,916
SO STRONG AND THEY JUST MIGHT
TRY TO TAKE US OUT?

1158
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,651
ABSOLUTELY THEYRE GOING TO.

1159
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:12,222
THE OTHER TRIBES HAVE SEEN US
BE A REALLY STRONG GROUP OF

1160
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:16,059
FIVE, AND IF FIRST THING I WOULD
WANT TO DO IS TAKE OUT THAT

1161
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,762
GROUP OF FIVE, SPLIT IT UP, TAKE
OUT SOME BIG THREATS IN THE

1162
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:19,996
GAME.

1163
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,399
SO IF I CAN MAKE EVERYONE FEEL
LIKE THEYRE A BIG THREAT, MAYBE

1164
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,900
WE CAN ALL UNITE.

1165
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,370
LETS BE REAL, YOURE
BEAUTIFUL AND SMART, MED

1166
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,706
STUDENT, YOU KNOW THIS GAME
REALLY WELL AND YOUVE BEEN

1167
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:30,340
KILLER IN CHALLENGES.

1168
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,642
DONT SAY ALL, THAT JOE.

1169
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,045
YOU KNOW THEYRE ALL THINKING
IT.

1170
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,481
I DONT THINK ANY OF US ARE PART
OF THEIR PLAN, OR IF WE ARE,

1171
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,783
ITS TEMPORARILY.

1172
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,051
YEAH.

1173
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:45,288
PEOPLE ARE EASILY THREATENED
BY SOMEONE WHO CAN WIN A COUPLE

1174
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:48,091
CHALLENGES AND SO WE HAVE TO
STICK TOGETHER.

1175
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,326
WELL GO FAR.

1176
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,195
BECAUSE ILL WIN THE IMMUNITIES
AND WE GET TO DECIDE WHERE WE

1177
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,363
WANT TO GO.

1178
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,999
WHEN YOU START HEARING JOE
SAYING THAT YOURE A THREAT,

1179
00:53:56,032 --> 00:54:00,036
ITS LIKE, OH, CRAP, LIKE IF
PEOPLE SEE ME AS A THREAT, THAT

1180
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:05,075
IS GOING TO MAKE MY GAME A LOT
HARDER ONCE WE DO GET TO A

1181
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:09,179
MERGE, SO IM DEFINITELY
ANTICIPATING HAVING TO ADAPT AND

1182
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:19,289
REARRANGE SOME THINGS TO STAY IN
THE GAME.

1183
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,258
JOE IS AMAZING AGAIN.

1184
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:25,395
OH, MY GOD, WHAT MUST IT BE
LIKE TO BE HIM?

1185
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:30,200
I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS LOW TIDE.

1186
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,034
THERES CRABS DOWN.

1187
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,836
THERE MAYBE CRAB LEGS FOR
DINNER.

1188
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:33,203
I DONT KNOW.

1189
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,038
IM DOWN.

1190
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,575
I NEED SOMETHING.

1191
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,010
WE LOST.

1192
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:40,577
YET AGAIN.

1193
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,178
AND ITS SO FRUSTRATING.

1194
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:47,050
ITS NOT EVEN THAT WERE LOSING,
ITS THAT WERE LOSING, AND WE

1195
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:51,788
COME BACK TO THIS CRAPPY-ASS
BEACH THAT HAS NO FOOD, A CRAPPY

1196
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:52,722
SHELTER.

1197
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,658
WERE SLEEPING IN THE MUD.

1198
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:58,828
ITS 24 HOUR DAYS OF JUST HELL,
ABSOLUTE HELL.

1199
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,832
I LITERALLY NEVER CRY AT HOME,
AND IVE CRIED LIKE FOUR DAYS IN

1200
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,135
A ROW NOW.

1201
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,171
IM DYING, LIKE LITERALLY
WALKING UP AND DOWN I WAS

1202
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:08,505
BLACKING OUT.

1203
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,040
REALLY?

1204
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,007
YES.

1205
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,410
IM SO HUNGRY, BUT THE RICE
MAKES ME SO SICK.

1206
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,745
I CANT FUNCTION.

1207
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:20,016
GIRL, YOU AND I ARE LIKE THE
ONLY PEOPLE DOING THINGS LIKE

1208
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,151
SUPER PHYSICAL IN THE
CHALLENGES.

1209
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,054
I NEED YOU.

1210
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,956
I JUST NEED THAT MERGE RIGHT
NOW.

1211
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,160
WEVE HAD ALMOST NO FOOD FOR
DAYS.

1212
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,928
AND WERE ALL FEELING IT.

1213
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:35,932
ESPECIALLY LAUREN.

1214
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,033
HE FOUND A CRAB.

1215
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,703
PULL THAT THING UP.

1216
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:44,674
HES REALLY ON THERE.

1217
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,278
THE IDEA OF FISHING I THINK
IS COUNTERINTUITIVE BECAUSE WE

1218
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,348
NEED TO SAVE OUR CALORIES AND
ENERGY FOR THESE CHALLENGES.

1219
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,316
HOW ARE THEY GETTING AWAY.

1220
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,185
BUT AT LEAST DAVID STILL HAS
LIFE.

1221
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:56,319
YOU KNOW?

1222
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,589
LAUREN IS KIND OF LIKE GIVING
UP.

1223
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,491
MAYBE SHES THE ONE TO GO NEXT.

1224
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,860
I KNOW THAT WENTWORTH IS GOOD
WITH IT.

1225
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:08,531
BUT TO PULL IT OFF, I NEED
DAVID.

1226
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,633
I FEEL VERY TORN RIGHT NOW.

1227
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:15,605
LAUREN IS SOMEBODY THAT IVE
BEEN CLOSE TO FROM DAY ONE.

1228
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,240
BUT HER MIND IS NOT IN THE GAME.

1229
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:17,941
RIGHT.

1230
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:22,345
I CAN SEE HER JUST TWIMPING.

1231
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,414
I NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL RIDE OR
DIE.

1232
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,584
LETS JUST SAY WE LOST LAUREN,
ARE YOU WITH US TO THE END, RIDE

1233
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:28,485
OR DIE?

1234
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,887
I DONT THINK I HAVE A
CHOICE, BUT YES.

1235
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,289
HOPEFULLY WE JUST WIN AND
WHATEVER.

1236
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:36,359
I UNDERSTAND THAT AT SOME
POINT I MIGHT HAVE TO VOTE OUT

1237
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,026
LAUREN.

1238
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,596
SHES LITERALLY WASTING AWAY.

1239
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:42,966
HOWEVER, WARDOG, WHO IS A
PSYCHOWHEN IT COMES TO NUMBER

1240
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:46,002
CRUNCHING AND FLIPPING
ALLIANCES, HES ALMOST SCARING

1241
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:46,870
ME NOW.

1242
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,006
I DONT KNOW IF I WANT TO WORK
WITH HIM.

1243
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,809
THE THING IS I FEEL LIKE WITH
HIM I JUST AGREE A LOT.

1244
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,411
THATS WHAT I DO.

1245
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,613
HE DOESNT WANT TO HEAR YOUR
OPINION.

1246
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,115
HE REALLY WANTS TO BARK AN ORDER
AT YOU AND HAVE YOU GO ON WITH

1247
00:56:59,149 --> 00:56:59,682
IT.

1248
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,284
ITS A DICTATORSHIP.

1249
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:06,322
WARDOG IS PLAYING REALLY
HARD, FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH,

1250
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,657
AND ITS REALLY ANNOYING.

1251
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,427
HE DOES NOTHING AT CAMP HE
SPENDS MOST OF HIS DAYS

1252
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,694
STRATEGIZING AND CRUNCHING
NUMBERS.

1253
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:15,799
ALSO HE SUCKS AT THESE PHYSICAL
CHALLENGE, AND ALL OF THAT IS

1254
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:20,570
PUTTING A HUGE TARGET ON HIS
BACK, WHICH IS GREAT WITH ME.

1255
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,704
WE HAVE TO DO WHATEVER IS
BEST FOR US.

1256
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,939
IM WITH YOU.

1257
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:28,411
WHEN THE GAME STARTED, I WANTED
TO VOTE OUT WENTWORTH, BUT NOW

1258
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,948
IM WORKING WITH THE PERSON WHO
I THOUGHT WAS MY BIGGEST

1259
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,616
ADVERSARY OUT HERE, BUT IF
THATS GOING TO GET ME TO DAY

1260
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,652
39, THEN THATS WHAT IM GOING
TO DO.

1261
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:47,464
♪

1262
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:49,766
WHATS UP?

1263
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,800
I GOT MORE INFO.

1264
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:54,504
THIS MORNING WE FOUND A BASKET
WITH FIVE NEW MAPS.

1265
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:58,007
THEY LOOK THE SAME AS BEFORE,
EXCEPT THERES A BUNCH OF HOLES.

1266
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:03,980
SO IM ASSUMING THAT MEANS
THERES SOMETHING ELSE TO FIND.

1267
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,850
CAN WE LESSEN THE LEVEL OF
PARANOIA THIS TIME AND NO ONE

1268
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,785
TAKE OFF?

1269
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,587
NO PROMISES.

1270
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,057
WE GET THE MAP AND EVERYONE
STARTS FOLLOWING IT.

1271
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,759
IM A NEWBIE IN THIS EDGE OF
EXTINCTION LANGUAGE.

1272
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:17,927
ALL RIGHT.

1273
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,662
IM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GO.

1274
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,165
I DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON.

1275
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:25,768
BUT THEY SEEM TO KNOW IF YOU
FOLD IT AND SOMETHING POINTS,

1276
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:31,741
YOURE GOING TO FIND AN
ADVANTAGE.

1277
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,143
IS THIS THING EVEN OUT HERE?

1278
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:39,549
THERES MAD SCRAMBLE UP TOP.

1279
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,252
I WAS ABLE TO FIGURE OUT FIRST
MAP.

1280
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,021
BUT THE SECOND MAP WAS MUCH
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

1281
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:48,358
IM LOOKING EVERYWHERE AND THEN
FINALLY ITS LIKE, OH, MY GOSH,

1282
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:58,001
ITS ON THE BEACH.

1283
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,437
WHAT I FIGURED OUT IS ALL THE
HOLES LINE UP TO ONE HOLE.

1284
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,040
WHEN YOU LAYER THAT ON TOP OF
THE OTHER MAP, IT PUTS IT RIGHT

1285
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:10,413
NEXT TO THE MAST.

1286
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,447
OH, COME ON.

1287
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,417
I WAS SO SURE IT WAS THERE.

1288
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:19,956
I DUG AND DUG, BUT APPARENTLY I
WAS AT THE WRONG SPOT.

1289
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:23,459
I KNOW DEVENS IS GOOD WITH
MAPS.

1290
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:27,630
SO IM THINKING MAYBE HES JUST
OFF A LITTLE BIT.

1291
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:31,601
THEN I THINK WHEN ITS SUPER LOW
TIDE, THERE ARE ALL THESE ROCKS

1292
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,137
SHOWING THEMSELVES, SO I START
WALKING BY THE WATER TO SEE IF

1293
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:38,041
MAYBE IT WAS IN THERE.

1294
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:48,651
WHAT IS THAT?

1295
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:49,819
FREAKING INSANE.

1296
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,388
THIS ENTIRE TIME I HAVE
NEEDED A BREAKTHROUGH, AND THEN

1297
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:58,394
ALL OF A SUDDEN IN THE SEA WATER
I FOUND THIS.

1298
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,762
CHRIS, HES GOT IT.

1299
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,364
THANK YOU, JESUS.

1300
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:07,337
WHEN THE TIME COME, PENALIZE
YOUR BIGGEST THREAT BY ASSIGNING

1301
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,038
THESE MAPS TO THEM.

1302
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,574
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I PRAYED
FOR.

1303
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,709
CHRIS HAS BEEN GETTING THE BEST
OF ME.

1304
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:16,946
THIS IS GOING TO LET ME PUT A
LITTLE CURSE ON CHRIS.

1305
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,115
APPARENTLY WERE GOING TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF COMPETITION, AND

1306
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,084
THIS COULD HELP MYSELF GET BACK
IN THE GAME.

1307
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,819
I NEEDED IT.

1308
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,688
AND THANK GOD THAT I GOT IT.

1309
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:29,492
IM JUST PISSED BECAUSE I SAID,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE.

1310
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,127
BUT I DIDNT TOUCH IT FIRST.

1311
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,364
WHAT THE HELL, REEM?

1312
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,131
YOU GAVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.

1313
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:38,835
YOU THINK I GAVE IT AWAY?

1314
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:39,902
IM NOT THAT STUPID.

1315
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,404
I WANTED THAT.

1316
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:42,405
THE RULES ARE THE RULES.

1317
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:45,141
THOSE TWO GET ON MY DAMN NERVES.

1318
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:50,847
YOU JUST ACCUSED ME OF GIVING
AWAY AN ADVANTAGE.

1319
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,348
DO I HAVE COMPLETE IDIOT WRITTEN
ON MY FOREHEAD.

1320
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:53,449
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO
SAY.

1321
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,153
YOU JUST SAID I GAVE IT TO
HIM.

1322
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:59,789
DONT YOU TELL ME I GAVE
SOMETHING AWAY.

1323
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:03,326
WELL, YOU POINT AT IT AND HE
PICKS IT UP AND RUNS AWAY.

1324
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,095
YOU GOT THE BIGGEST MOUTH IN
THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

1325
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:09,032
YOURE THE ONE WHO SAID I GAVE
HIM THE ADVANTAGE.

1326
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:12,502
BY SAYING THAT, YOU LIT OFF A
VOLCANO, BRO.

1327
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:14,971
IT IS A DISASTER HERE.

1328
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:19,075
IT TRULY IS THE MOST
DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY IVE EVER

1329
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:19,609
MET.

1330
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:20,877
I DONT NEED ZERO.

1331
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,512
THEN WHY ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT IT?

1332
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:26,549
BECAUSE YOURE GETTING ON MY
[BLEEPED] NERVES, AND ITS 12

1333
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:29,352
DAYS OF LISTENING TO THE BULL
[BLEEPED].

1334
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,586
AND IM DONE WITH IT.

1335
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:34,524
THE WORST PART OF IT ALL, NO
ONE KNOWS HOW LONG THIS TRAIN

1336
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:35,692
WRECK CAN LAST.

1337
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:39,529
THATS A SCARY SITUATION,
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LEGITIMATELY

1338
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:40,596
LOSING IT.

1339
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:44,634
REEM, THATS ALL --
 [SCREAMS]

1340
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:00,016
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1341
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:14,597
ALL RIGHT.

1342
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,299
LETS GET TO TODAYS IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

1343
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:20,403

THANK YOU.

1346

ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

FOR TODAYS CHALLENGE, YOURE

1350
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:48,831
SPRINT TO THE FINISH TO SOLVE A
"SURVIVOR" SLIDE PUZZLE.

1351

01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,342
OH, NO.

1361
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,086
OH, MY GOD.

1362
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,354
OH, WOW.

1363
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,656
Jeff: ILL GIVE YOU A
MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

WELL GET STARTED.

1365
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:19,962
WOW.

01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,265
HERE WE GO.

1368
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,135
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?

1369
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,070
GO!

1370
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:34,177
GET UP THAT LADDER, AND THEN
START TRACING THAT BAG ALONG THE

1371
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,445
ROPES TO GET IT OUT OF THE
BAMBOO FRAME.

1372
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,781
TRY NOT TO LET IT --.

1373
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,783
Jeff: YOU CANT GET AHEAD
OF THE BAG.

1374
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:44,587
YOURE ONLY AS SLOW AS THAT
PERSON WORKING ON THE BAG.

1375
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:49,859
IT IS KAMA IN THE LEAD, WHICH IS
BECOMING PREDICTABLE STORY IN

1376
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:50,726
CHALLENGES THIS SEASON.

1377
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,497
AND THEN MANU AND LESTER SIDE BY
SIDE.

1378
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,967
ITS GOING TO BE KAMA OUT FIRST
WITH THEIR BAG.

1379
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,535
AURORA IS DOWN.

1380
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:00,803

1383
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:03,673
GO.

1384
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:04,807
Jeff: MANU COMING DOWN.

1385
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,409

1386
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,478
IT IS NOW LESU IN DEAD LAST ONCE
AGAIN.

1387
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,247
JULIA WORKING ON THE KNOTS.

1388
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,415
YOURE GOOD!

1389
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:15,551
JOE NOW GOING TO START UNTYING
KNOTS ON THE BAG, TRYING TO

1390
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,354
RELEASE THAT MONKEYS FIST.

1391
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,789
UP ON THE PLATFORM.

1392
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,457
Jeff: MANU, YOURE GOOD.

1393
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,594
GOING TO BE GAVIN UNTYING KNOTS
FOR MANU.

1394
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:25,328
LAURENS GOT IT.

1395
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,596
ITS GOING TO BE WARDOG NOW.

1396
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:28,064
COME ON, JOE.

1397
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,966
Jeff: JOE HAS THAT MONKEY
FIST.

1398
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,401
NOW HES LOOKING TO DROP IT IN
THAT HOOP, WHICH WILL DROP THAT

1399
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:36,205
CAGE DOOR.

1400
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,943
JOE DROPS THE CAGE FOR KAMA ON
HIS VERY FIRST TOSS.

1401
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,613
GOOD TOSS.

1402
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,847
Jeff: GAVIN TOSSES.

1403
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,082
HE DROPS HIS CAGE.

1404
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,316
GO, MANU.

1405
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:51,220
TWO PEOPLE ON THE PUZZLE NOW,
GOING TO BE "JULIE & JULIA" FOR

1406
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:51,787
KAMA.

1407
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,189
YOU GOT THIS, WARDOG.

1408
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,824
GIVE THE ROPE SOME SLACK.

1409
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:55,992
Jeff: MANU IS OVER.

1410
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,127
ITS GOING TO BE VICTORIA AND
ERIC.

1411
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,497
HERE WE GO, WARDOG.

1412
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:02,431
WARDOG, NO, NO, NO.

1413
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,367
Jeff: YOU GOT TO STAY ON
IT.Ñi

1414
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,568
NO!

1415
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:06,736
OKAY.

1416
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:07,703
SORRY.

1417
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,172
Jeff: WARDOG HAS NOT HAD A
LOT OF SUCCESS.

1418
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,775
WARDOGS GOT IT FOR LESU.

1419
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,844
AWKWARD BUT ACCOMPLISHED IT.

1420
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:20,349
GET OVER THAT CAGE.

1421
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,985
IT IS DAVID AND WENTWORTH FOR
LESU.

1422
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,322
EVERYBODY NOW WORKING ON THE
PUZZLE.

1423
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:27,490
JULIE GOING TO STEP OUT.

1424
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:28,791
JOE AND JULIA IN NOW.

1425
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:29,992
OKAY, JOE.

1426
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,027
I GOT IT.

1427
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:31,694
I GOT IT.

1428
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:32,862
I THINK I GOT IT.

1429
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:36,332
Jeff: THIS PUZZLE COULD
TAKE A VERY LONG TIME OR IF YOU

1430
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:41,604
KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND A SLIDE
PUZZLE, YOU COULD GET THIS VERY

1431
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:42,838
FAST.

1432
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,307
DAVID THINKS HE HAS SOMETHING.

1433
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,876
LESU HAS BEEN ON A LOSING STREAK
OF EPIC PROPORTIONS.

1434
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:49,345
READY?

1435
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:53,983
Jeff: CAN LESU PULL OUT A
VICTORY RIGHT NOW?

1436
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,418
JEFFREY?

1437
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,555
Jeff: KAMA THINKS THEY HAVE
IT AND THEY DO.

1438
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:02,491
WOW.

1439
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,426
OH, MY GOD.

1440
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:06,896
Jeff: JOE AND JULIA SOLVE
IT FOR KAMA.

1441
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:14,603
KAMA WINS IMMUNITY SENDING LESU
AND MANU TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1442
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:19,275
ONCE AGAIN KAMA WINS IMMUNITY.

1443
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,609
NOBODY GOING HOME.

1444
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,410
NICE WORK.

1445
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:24,480
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

1446
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:28,551
ALL RIGHT, LESU, MANU, TONIGHT
BOTH TRIBES WILL COME TO TRIBAL

1447
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:33,756
COUNCIL TOGETHER AND VOTE ONE
PERSON OUT OF THE GAME.

1448
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:34,957
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1449
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,558
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1450
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:36,592
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

1451
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,495
GOING INTO TRIBAL TONIGHT,
IM LIKE PANICKING.

1452
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:42,231
THERES FOUR LESU AND FOUR MANU.

1453
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:45,735
WE COULD FIND OURSELVES AT A TIE
AND GOING TO ROCKS.

1454
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:49,839
I HAVE GONE TO ROCKS BEFORE, AND
AS A FAN, ITS EXHILARATING.

1455
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,208
AS A PLAYER ITS NAUSEATING.

1456
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,343
STRAP YOURSELF IN, EVERYBODY.

1457
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:57,380
ITS GOING TO BE CHAOTIC.

1458
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,797
THE CHALLENGE WENT HORRIBLY.

1459
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,065
KAMA WINS AGAIN.

1460
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:21,003
WITH THE ADDED TWIST THAT BOTH
TRIBES WILL BE GOING TO TRIBAL

1461
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:21,404
COUNCIL.

1462
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,372
WAIT FOR IT.

1463
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:24,240
DRUM ROLL.

1464
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,474
TOGETHER.

1465
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:29,178
WHICH IS AN INTERESTING PROBLEM,
BECAUSE IF WE GO TO A 4-4 TIE,

1466
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,112
EVERYONE VOTES AGAIN.

1467
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:33,182
IF NO ONE CHANGES THEIR VOTE, WE
DRAW ROCKS.

1468
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,383
ANYONE CAN GO HOME.

1469
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:38,254
FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THE
BEST THING WE COULD DO IS STICK

1470
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:39,221
TOGETHER AS A FOUR.

1471
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,390
WE CANT POSSIBLY SPLIT.

1472
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,926
ARE YOU ALL WILLING TO DRAW
STONES?

1473
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:46,195
THATS THE THING.

1474
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,396
WE HAVE NO ALLIANCE.

1475
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:51,067
SO IF WE HIT LAUREN OR WARDOG, I
THINK THEY WOULD FLIP ON OUR

1476
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,234
SIDE.

1477
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:54,570
I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD
SHOT IN BEING ABLE TO SWAY

1478
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:58,841
DAVID, BECAUSE THE LESU TRIBE,
AT LEAST FROM WHEN I WAS PART OF

1479
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,310
THAT TRIBE, THEY WERENT LOYAL
TO EACH OTHER, AND HE DOESNT

1480
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:05,214
HAVE THE NUMBERS TO SURVIVE THE
MERGE, SO IM HOPING THAT DAVID

1481
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,782
REALIZES THAT HES ON A SINKING
SHIP.

1482
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,485
I THINK THAT SOMEBODY WILL DO
IT.

1483
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:12,855
I DONT THINK THEY WOULD ALL
GO TO ROCKS.

1484
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,157
WHAT RETURNING PLAYER IS GOING
TO COME BACK FOR A THIRD TIME

1485
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:16,792
AND BE WILLING TO GO TO ROCKS?

1486
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:19,862
I THINK RIGHT NOW THE FACT
THAT THEY HAVE TWO RETURNING

1487
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:23,232
PLAYERS IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR US.

1488
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,635
YOU DONT COME OUT HERE TWO,
THREE, TIMES TO GET SENT HOME

1489
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:27,803
BEFORE THE MERGE BY A ROCK.

1490
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:31,574
SO IN TERMS OF THIS CRAPPY
SITUATION, I FEEL LIKE OUR SIDE

1491
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:35,111
COULD POSSIBLY BE SLIGHTLY
BETTER OFF.

1492
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:39,849
IF WE WILL ALL GO TO ROCKS, I
THINK ALL WE HAVE TO SAY IS, YOU

1493
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,952
CAN BELIEVE US OR NOT, BUT WERE
WILLING TO GO TO ROCKS TONIGHT.

1494
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,954
WE DONT THINK YOUR TRIBE IS.

1495
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:46,655
ROLL THE DICE?

1496
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,757
I THINK THATS OUR BEST BET.

1497
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,127
EVERYTHING IS A GAMBLE
TONIGHT.

1498
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,429
BUT IM A BIG FAN OF THIS GAME.

1499
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:56,932
IVE BEEN IMAGINING MYSELF IN
THESE EXACT SITUATIONS FOR

1500
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,134
YEARS.

1501
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:03,105
YOU DONT IMAGINE YOURSELF IN
THE EASY TRIBAL COUNCIL VOTE.

1502
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,642
YOU THINK YOWFERS IN THIS
SITUATION, GOING INTO TRIBAL

1503
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,577
COUNCIL, PROBABLY GOING TO GO TO
ROCKS.

1504
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:11,947
THATS WHAT MAKES A PERSON LIKE
ME AT HOME WANT TO PLAY THIS

1505
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:12,748
GAME.

1506
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,817
ITS THIS, TONIGHT, BUT IS IT
SCARY?

1507
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,384
YEAH.

1508
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,385
I COULD GO HOME TONIGHT.

1509
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,755
NO QUESTION.

1510
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:22,892
DO YOU THINK THEYRE MORE LIKELY
TO PUT VOTES ON YOU OR ME?

1511
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:27,963
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1512
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,798
I WISH I KNEW.

1513
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,300
AND YOULL GO TO ROCKS?

1514
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,569
I GUESS.

1515
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:34,570
ID BE WILLING TO DO THAT.

1516
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,605
I DONT WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT
STAGE WITHOUT YOU.

1517
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,640
OF COURSE.

1518
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:38,374
WERE IN IT TOGETHER.

1519
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,375
YOURE MY MAN.

1520
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,011
NO ONE WANTS TO GO OUT WITH
ROCKS.

1521
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:44,880
THATS THE BIG FEAR IN THIS
GAME, BUT I DID SIGN UP TO PLAY

1522
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:45,781
"SURVIVOR."

1523
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,082
I FEEL LIKE THATS WHAT IM
DOING TONIGHT.

1524
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,386
SO IT FEELS GOOD, BUT IM ALSO
GOING TO BE CRAPPING BRICKS.

1525
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:54,823
I HAVE 100% TRUST IN ERIC AND
VICTORIA.

1526
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:58,627
AND AFTER LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,
WENDY IS WITH US 100%.

1527
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,496
ILL DRAW ROCKS FOR ONE OF THEM.

1528
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:08,637
I HOPE THE GOD THEYD DO THE
SAME FOR ME.

1529
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,707
THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE
MOVE EITHER WAY, BUT I THINK IT

1530
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:12,775
CAN WORK.

1531
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,710
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE
ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

1532
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:15,911
NO QUESTION.

1533
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,148
THE WHOLE THING TONIGHT COULD
COME DOWN TO DRAWING ROCKS.

1534
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:23,085
WE JUST ALL AGREED THAT WERE
ALL DOWN FOR THAT.

1535
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:24,320
IM NOT.

1536
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,789
IM KIND OF WILLING TO PUT MY
VOTE WHEREVER TO KEEP ME IN THE

1537
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,023
GAME.

1538
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,393
IF I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO BETRAY
AN ALLIANCE TO MOVE MYSELF ONE

1539
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,230
STEP FURTHER IN THE GAME, IM
GOING TO DO IT, BECAUSE I CAN

1540
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,764
FIND AN IN SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1541
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,099
DONT EVER TRUST ME, MAN.

1542
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:45,140
I DONT KNOW IF ANYONE HAS
FIGURED THAT OUT YET.Ñi

1543
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:45,808
OKAY.

1544
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:46,909
SO HERES THE THING.

1545
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:49,979
IF I WERE THEM, I WOULD STAY
FOUR STRONG.

1546
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:50,613
UH-HUH.

1547
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,147
TRY AND FLIP ONE OF YOU.

1548
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:52,615
CORRECT.

1549
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:53,816
RIGHT.

1550
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:57,319
I WANT TO TAKE OUT ONE OF THE
BIG GUY, BUT I FEEL LIKE THE

1551
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,055
LAST PERSON THEY WOULD THINK WE
WOULD TAKE OUT WOULD BE

1552
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:00,589
VICTORYA.

1553
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:01,257
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1554
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:04,159
FOUR VOTES ON WENDY, RIGHT?

1555
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:09,131
WE VOTE, ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE
LIKE DO, YOU WANT THE DRAW ROCKS

1556
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:09,932
FOR WENDY.

1557
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,267
THEY MIGHT FLIP ON WENDY RIGHT
THERE.

1558
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,770
ONCE AGAIN, WARDOG DIDNT
THEREON WHAT ANYBODY ELSE HAD TO

1559
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:15,437
SAY.

1560
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,705
HE TRIES TO OVERPOWER PEOPLE.

1561
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,541
HES GOT HIS PLAN, AND THATS
THAT.

1562
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,011
BUT TO BE HONEST, WARDOG IS
RIGHT.

1563
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,147
WENDY IS NOT AN ORIGINAL KAMA
MEMBER.

1564
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,785
SO HOPEFULLY WE HAVE TO REVOTE
SOMEONE WILL FLIP AND HELP US

1565
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,620
VOTE HER OUT.

1566
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:36,125
I THINK I SHOULD GO OVER TO
WENDY AND SAY VOTE FOR WHATEVER

1567
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,426
NAME WE WANT HER TO VOTE FOR.

1568
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,262
IT GOES 4, 3, 1...

1569
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,499
I THINK THEYRE GOING TO VOTE
FOR ME, BECAUSE THEYRE GOING TO

1570
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:44,900
THINK KELLEY OR YOU HAS THE
IDOL.

1571
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,835
I THINK SHE WOULD BE THE
LOGICAL VOTE.

1572
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,704
WE JUST CANT CRUMBLE.

1573
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:49,738
THATS THE THING.

1574
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,539
WE CANNOT.

1575
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,841
WE HAVE TO GO IN THERE FOUR
STRONG.

1576
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,376
ILL GO TO ROCKINGS.

1577
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,244
ILL GO TO ROCKS.

1578
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:55,811
ME TOO.

1579
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:58,580
IVE DONE IT BEFORE.

1580
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:01,250
THIS PLAN MAKES ME REALLY
NERVOUS.

1581
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:06,288
I DIDNT COME THIS FAR JUST TO
GO TO ROCKS, BUT WARDOG ALWAYS

1582
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,492
HAS HIS OWN AGENDAS AND NOBODY
CAN EVEN HAVE AN INPUT.

1583
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,194
SO IM PISSED.

1584
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:15,431
IM SO CLOSE TO MAKING THE
MERGE, AND THIS COULD RUIN

1585
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,132
EVERYTHING.

1586
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,200
WE GOT TO MERGE TOMORROW.

1587
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,068
IM SO HUNGRY.

1588
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:19,902
OKAY.

1589
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:23,238
WE NEED A TON MORE FIREWOOD FOR
THIS.

1590
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:25,307
JUST TO KEEP US GOING.

1591
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,644
I GOT LIKE 15, 20 MINUTES TO
DRY THIS WOOD OUT.

1592
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,446
OKAY.

1593
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:38,887
ILL GO DOWN TO THE BEACH.

1594
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:40,956
HE DOESNT CONTRIBUTE AT ALL.

1595
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:41,757
ITS CRAZY.

1596
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,992
HES SO OBVIOUSLY LIKE
PLOTTING.

1597
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:47,196
HES TOTALLY PLOTTING.

1598
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,966
WE HAVE A GOOD PLAN TONIGHT,
HOWEVER, IM WORRIED TO DEATH

1599
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,034
ABOUT LAUREN.

1600
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,202
SHE ISNT WELL.

1601
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:56,672
ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT IS THE
MERGE, FOOD, MERGE, FOOD, MERGE,

1602
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:57,473
FOOD.

1603
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,074
I CANT WORK WITH SOMEONE LIKE
THAT.

1604
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:03,045
SO IM LIKE DO, I REALLY WANT TO
GO TO ROCKS FOR THIS GIRL?

1605
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,980
IM NOT SO SURE.

1606
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:06,849
LETS GO EXPLORE.

1607
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,351
HOWEVER, THE MANU TRIBE MIGHT BE
TARGETING ME.

1608
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:16,959
BUT IF I CAN FIND AN IDOL THAT
WILL GIVE ME TREMENDOUS POWER.

1609
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:20,596
WARDOG?

1610
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,097
I CAN IN THE BELIEVE IT.

1611
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:24,867
HE LITERALLY DOES NOTHING.

1612
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,868
ITS INSANE.

1613
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,102
LIKE WHERE IS HE?

1614
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:29,471
HES PROBABLY LOOKING FOR THE
IDOL.

1615
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:30,839
WARDOG DISAPPEARED.

1616
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,274
HES NOT HELPING AT ALL.

1617
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:34,243
HES NOT CONTRIBUTING AT ALL.

1618
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,178
HE GOES OFF INTO THE JUNGLE.

1619
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,046
WARDOG IS CREATING A WAR.

1620
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:43,218
I GUESS THATS WHAT WAR DOGS DO.

1621
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,353
HES BEING DIVISIVE.

1622
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:45,254
WE NEED TO BE UNITED.

1623
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,989
IM GOING TO GO LOOK FOR IT.

1624
01:13:47,022 --> 01:14:00,202
LETS GO LOOK I GUESS, RIGHT?

1625
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:01,303
WHERE WERE YOU?

1626
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:02,438
DOWN BY THE BEACH.

1627
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:03,539
WE COULDNT FIND YOU.

1628
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,108
YOU WERENT LOOKING HARD
ENOUGH.

1629
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,944
I WANT TO FIND THE IDOL
BEFORE WARDOG.

1630
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:10,846
HES A SCHEMER AND MANIPULATOR.

1631
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:11,947
HES ALREADY CALLING THE SHOTS.

1632
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,917
AND WITH AN IDOL, HES JUST
GOING TO GET MORE AND MORE

1633
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,151
POWERFUL.

1634
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:17,319
IT SHOULDNT BE THIS HARD.

1635
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:17,820
IT SHOULDNT.

1636
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:18,687
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

1637
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,589
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1638
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:25,127
AND THEN I LOOK UP IN THE TREE,
AND, BING, ITS JUST SITTING

1639
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:25,961
RIGHT THERE.

1640
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:33,635
LETS GO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
CAMP.

1641
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,437
IM GOING THE STAY HERE.

1642
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,140
IN "SURVIVOR," YOU NEVER GIVE
UP, BECAUSE THIS GAME IS ALWAYS

1643
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:39,374
CHANGING.

1644
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:42,144
AND NEG THAT TONIGHT IS SUCH A
CRAZY TRIBAL POTENTIALLY, HAVING

1645
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,814
THAT SAFETY IS HUGE.

1646
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:57,259
IM PERPLEXED.

1647
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,294
TONIGHTS TRIBAL COUNCIL IS
HUGE.

1648
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,463
KELLEY AND I HAVE IDOLS.

1649
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,965
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM GOING TO
DO.

1650
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,366
ITS NOT WORTH GOING HOME.

1651
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,501
I KNOW.

1652
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:08,103
TONIGHT THE MANU TRIBE IS
MOST LIKELY TARGETING ME OR

1653
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:09,338
WARDOG.

1654
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,073
EVERYONE IS BANKING ON THE FACT
THAT THEYRE NOT GOING TO WANT

1655
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:14,943
TO GO TO ROCKS FOR WENDY, BUT IF
THEY STAY STRONG, ROCKS WILL

1656
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:15,911
DETERMINE WHO GOES HOME.

1657
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:21,316
I REALLY DONT WANT THE DRAW
ROCKS.

1658
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,119
WOULD YOU GO TO ROCKS FOR
WARDOG?

1659
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,989
IM NOT GOING TO ROCKS FOR
WARDOG.

1660
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:31,760
IF WE GO TO ROCK, ITS A 1-6
CHANCE YOU GO HOME SOME IF

1661
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,862
THEYRE VOTING FOR WARDOG, IM
GOING TO FLIP.

1662
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,865
BUT I CAN SEE THEM GOING AFTER
ME, SO I GOT TO DECIDE IF IM

1663
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:38,934
GOING TO PLAY MY IDOL OR NOT.

1664
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:42,604
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF
ON-THE-SLY DECISIONS.

1665
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:45,641
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHATS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

1666
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,502
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1667
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:17,105
TWO TRIKES GEAR TO VOTE OUT ONE
PERSON.

1668
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:20,442
VICTORIA, ANY TIME THERES A
TWIST INVOLVING TRIBAL, IT CAN

1669
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,277
BE UNNERVING.

1670
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:25,581
DID YOU FEEL A DIFFERENT SENSE
AT MANU THIS AFTERNOON?

1671
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:28,050
I WOULD SAY THE MAIN
DIFFERENCE WAS THERE WERE NO

1672
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,284
SIDE CONVERSATIONS.

1673
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:33,789
IT WAS ONE LARGE CONVERSATION
BECAUSE WE GOT EVEN TRIBES HERE.

1674
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:34,990
ITS FOUR AGAINST FOUR.

1675
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,626
IF WERE NOT ALL ON THE SAME
PAGE, WERE IMMEDIATELY SCREWED.

1676
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,861
LETS TALKING ABOUT THE LESU
TRIBE.

1677
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:42,831
LAUREN, WAS IT SIMILAR TO MANU
IN THAT YOU ALL GOT TOGETHER AND

1678
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:43,899
SAID, WE HAVE TO BE UNITED.

1679
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,935
WE DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT STAYING UNITED.

1680
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,870
WE KNEW WE WERE GOING THE STAY
UNITED.

1681
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:53,475
WERE A VERY STRONG FOUR THAT
GENUINELY HAS BEEN THROUGH SO

1682
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:54,509
MUCH.

1683
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:57,012
Jeff: WARDOG, PRETTY
INTERESTING, FOUR FROM ONE

1684
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,181
TRIBE, FOUR FROM ANOTHER, BUT
ONLY ONE GOING HOME.

1685
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:02,584
ITS KIND OF CRAZY, BECAUSE
WHEN YOU FIRST SAID ONLY ONE

1686
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,455
TRIBE GETS IMMUNITY, I FELT THAT
PAIN IN MY STOMACH, BUT WHEN YOU

1687
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:10,525
FIND OUT 1 OUT OF 8, PREPARING
FOR THE GUN KNIGHT AT THE O.K.

1688
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:11,059
CORRAL.

1689
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:14,930
I HAVE MY WYATT EARP.

1690
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,531
THAT MAKES ME DOC HOLIDAY.

1691
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:17,566
WE HAVE OUR PLAN.

1692
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:19,101
WERE GOING TO STICK WITH EACH
OTHER.

1693
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:22,104
ITS GOING TO BE FUN
 THE TRICKY THING IS THEY

1694
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:25,941
DONT KNOW US IN A TRIBE IN THE
SAME WAY WE DONT KNOW THEM.

1695
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,276
SO ITS HARD TO PUT A LOT OF
WEIGHT INTO ANYTHING THATS

1696
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,378
SAID.

1697
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,380
Jeff: WENTWORTH, THIS
REALLY IS "SURVIVOR" WARFARE.

1698
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,249
I THINK THIS IS DEFINITELY A
BATTLE TONIGHT, BUT WE ARE FOUR

1699
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:35,250
STRONG.

1700
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,053
WE WOULD WELCOME ANYONE OVER
HERE WITH OPEN ARMS.

1701
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:44,026
Jeff: GAVIN IS -- GAFERREN,
WENTWORTH IS SAYING, JOIN US

1702
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:46,161
RIGHT NOW AND WELL CHANGE THE
GAME.

1703
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:47,429
THATS A GREAT SPEECH.

1704
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:50,799
I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THE SAME
THING TO YOU GUYS, BECAUSE WERE

1705
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:53,402
GOING TO STICK STROKE TO OUR
GUN, AS WELL.

1706
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,738
Jeff: WENDY, ONE OTHER
INTERESTING ASPECTS IS YOU HAVE

1707
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:57,839
SOME INSIGHT.

1708
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:00,075
DID THE TRIBE LOOK TO YOU AND
SAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1709
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,644
THATS ESSENTIALLY WHAT
HAPPENED.

1710
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:05,781
I FEEL LIKE IM HAVING A
FLASHBACK ON MY FIRST PART OF

1711
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:06,748
THE GAME.

1712
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,684
SO ITS LIKE IM BASICALLY IN
THE MIDDLE.

1713
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,619
Jeff: DAVID, THATS
INTERESTING.

1714
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:12,521
WENDY DIDNT SAY, I USED TO BE
WITH THEM.

1715
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:14,790
SHE SAID, I FEEL LIKE IM IN THE
MIDDLE.

1716
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,725
YEAH, THATS REALLY GOOD TO
HEAR.

1717
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:20,162
I THINK IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT
THE SWAP KICKED WENDY OUT OF THE

1718
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:24,266
GROUP OF PEOPLE, BUT WE STILL
CONSIDER HER PART OF THE TRIBE.

1719
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:25,801
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

1720
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,536
Jeff: WE LOVE YOU, WENDY.

1721
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:28,570
WE ALWAYS DID.

1722
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:32,507
THAT WASNT THE SENSE WHEN
SHE RECEIVED WENDY.

1723
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,742
SHE FELT ON THE OUTS.

1724
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:36,845
WE WELCOMED HER WITH OPEN ARMS
SOME WERE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT

1725
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,046
HER FEELING IN THE MIDDLE.

1726
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,349
Jeff: SO DAVID, YOU HAD TO
DISCUSS THE IDEA OF A TRUE

1727
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,685
DEADLOCK TIE IN WHICH YOU WOULD
FORCE A ROCK DRAW.

1728
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,155
YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW, IM
SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN TO ROCKS.

1729
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,824
I GO TO ROCKS FOR MY PEOPLE.

1730
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:51,960
IF IT HAS TO COME TO ROCKS
TONIGHT, THEN THATS EXACTLY

1731
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:52,794
WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1732
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:54,429
NOBODY HERE IS AFRAID TO DO
THAT.

1733
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,597
WE TRUST EACH OTHER.

1734
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:59,134
Jeff: VICTORIA, WHEN YOU
HEAR A VETERAN SAY, OH, I WILL

1735
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:02,671
GO TO ROCKS, CHECK MY HISTORY,
DOES THAT HAVE ANY WEIGHT WITH

01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:03,071
YOU?

1737
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:04,306

1738
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:08,043
I FIND IT REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE
YOU WOULD COME BACK INTO THIS

1739
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:12,581
GAME AGAIN AND AGAIN TO HAVE
YOUR FATE BE PUT INTO ROCKS IF

1740
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,015
YOU HAD ANOTHER OPTION.

1741
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:17,986
SO I GET IT AND I RESPECT IT,
BUT I DONT THINK YOU PLAYED

1742
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:21,490
