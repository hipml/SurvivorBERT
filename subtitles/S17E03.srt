00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:07,298
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,050
Despite having three of the

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,927
strongest players in the game,

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,220
including a former Olympic

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,179
athlete, the Fang tribe lost

7
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,390
three challenges in a row.

8
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,517
Fang is walking, literally

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,184
walking!

10
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,185
They thought they could turn

11
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,187
things around by picking GC to

12
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:21,563
be their leader.

13
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,147
>> If I was volunteered, I'll

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,398
take it.

15
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,482
If they want me to roll with

16
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,400
it, I mean, I'll do it.

17
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,401
>> PROBST: But he quit after

18
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:26,609
one day.

19
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,778
>> We don't need a damn leader.

20
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,988
I'm younger than all y'all, so

21
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,114
what I'm being the leader for?

22
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,115
>> PROBST: The Kota tribe was

23
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:32,365
on a roll.

24
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,492
They were hard-working and

25
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:34,743
upbeat.

26
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,161
>> I don't envision us losing

27
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,287
ever.

28
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,289
>> PROBST: So it was a shock to

29
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,415
everyone...

30
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,167
Fang wins reward!

31
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,960
...when Fang finally won a

32
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:44,711
challenge.

33
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,465
(cheering)

34
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,174
They sent Sugar to Exile

35
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,634
Island...

36
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,719
>> Oh, my God, oh, my God,

37
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,261
oh, my God!

38
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,345
(shrieks)

39
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,096
>> ...thinking she was so weak

40
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,181
she'd never find the

41
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:00,393
hidden immunity idol.

42
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,186
>> Oh, my God, I found it.

43
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,313
Okay, I'm going to cry.

44
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,355
(laughs)

45
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,440
>> PROBST: Sugar kept the idol

46
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,233
secret from everyone except her

47
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,234
closest ally Ace.

48
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,907
At the next immunity challenge,

49
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,991
Fang won again.

50
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:15,366
(cheering)

51
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,578
Fang wins immunity!

52
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,163
In their first trip to Tribal

53
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,247
Council, Kota demonstrated

54
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,958
their tribe unity by voting out

55
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,585
their smallest and weakest

56
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,712
player in a landslide.

57
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,672
Paloma's lone ally was Kelly,

58
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,216
who voted for Ace.

59
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,968
Paloma, the tribe has spoken.

60
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:34,260
15 are left.

61
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,931
Who will be voted out tonight?

62
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,359
>> Well, that kind of sucked.

63
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,152
I don't really want to do that

64
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:51,861
anymore.

65
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,112
>> I really didn't like that.

66
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,073
>> Me, neither.

67
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,282
>> We just got back from Tribal

68
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:56,533
Council.

69
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,785
Paloma got voted off.

70
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,620
I definitely lost a partner in

71
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,246
the game who I can, like, talk

72
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,330
to about things.

73
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,124
And now I'm worried about

74
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:05,542
the chopping block.

75
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,669
But things can change all the

76
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,586
time.

77
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
My strategy right now is I

78
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,005
want Ace off.

79
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,633
I just don't like Ace.

80
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,760
>> How do you feel about Tribal?

81
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,928
How was it for you?

82
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,304
>> It was a bloody godawful

83
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,347
experience.

84
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,932
Tribal Council was probably one

85
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:21,474
of the most un-pleasurable

86
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,060
things I have done in recent

87
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:24,894
history.

88
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,646
It was, uh, right there with my

89
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,273
wisdom teeth being pulled.

90
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,858
That was not fun going there.

91
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,984
>> No.

92
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:33,695
>> I didn't know she had that

93
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,279
much pent-up animosity towards

94
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,488
me.

95
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:35,905
>> I didn't, either.

96
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,782
>> I think Kelly voted for me,

97
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,492
and, uh, she will be the next

98
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,369
lamb to the slaughter.

105
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,830
cooking some sweet rice?

106
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,832
>> Have you seen the rice?

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,710
We're over halfway done.

108
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,630
>> We-we should be eating one

109
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,090
meal a day right now and...

110
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,262
Uh, I will, I will make my

111
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,222
speech, and then I'm going to

112
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,348
shut up, and you guys can

113
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,057
decide.

114
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,641
But we need to be eating one

115
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,018
meal a day, period.

116
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,561
We're all going to be hungry.

00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,355
That's why it's called<i> Survivor.</i>

118
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,274
The rice, quite simply, is

119
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:35,566
running out.

120
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,986
Strategically, I know that

121
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,114
Crystal, Kenny, and GC are not

122
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:41,406
with me.

123
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,490
They hadn't listened to a word

124
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,033
I've said since I've been here.

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,412
>> I'll catch up with you guys.

126
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,538
Matty, Susie, and Dan, they're

127
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,623
not my allies, but they're my

128
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,874
friends.

129
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,127
And I'm just not sure how to

130
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,544
play it right now.

131
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,420
>> I ain't never seen Dan go

132
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,337
pick fruit a day since we've

133
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,463
been here, and all of a sudden,

134
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,548
he going to go pick some fruit.

135
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,216
>> Exactly.

136
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,300
They're going to go talk right

137
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:01,884
now.

138
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,052
They got four r-right now.

139
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,095
There's three of us here.

140
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:04,554
>> That's four.

141
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,346
>> And there's four there.

142
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,848
So they could be trying to do,

143
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,432
you know, something right now.

144
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,184
All I know, it seem like the

145
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,519
tightest three is right here.

146
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,896
>> Those three alienated me

147
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,355
from the beginning.

148
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,857
>> Th-They alienate everybody.

149
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,524
>> I could tell GC the sky is

150
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,567
blue, and he's gonna argue with

151
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,943
me.

152
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:19,736
>> Matty's having a hard time

153
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,653
with Crystal, and I'm having a

154
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,154
hard time with Crystal.

155
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:21,738
>> She's hard for me to deal

156
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,864
with.

157
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,365
>> And Kenny, he-he's like

158
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,366
Mini-Me to GC.

159
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,952
>> And then GC is given and he

160
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,412
accepts the role as leader, and

161
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,789
he flails and he gives it back.

162
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,332
>> We have a cancer, and this

163
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,584
cancer's name is GC.

164
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,878
And at the right time, this

165
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,087
cancer is going to have to be

166
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:38,755
cut out.

167
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,715
We are all totally on the same

168
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,424
page with this.

169
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,383
>> No matter what, Susie.

170
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,259
>> No matter what.

171
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,343
>> I finally feel like I've

172
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,511
solidified my four with Dan,

173
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,722
Randy, and Susie.

174
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,016
And I really, truly feel that

175
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,267
this alliance that I've-- we've

176
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,643
created is going to be solid for

177
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,603
a while.

178
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,520
Think it's going to carry me

179
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:54,812
pretty far.

180
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,355
>> We don't need to talk about

181
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:56,689
this anymore.

182
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,190
>> No.

183
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,275
>> Just put it in.

184
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,902
>> All that matters is the four

185
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,028
of us.

186
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,533
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

187
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,667
Kota, come on in.

188
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,460
Fang getting your first look at

189
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,462
the new Kota.

190
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,090
Paloma voted out at the last

191
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,301
Tribal Council.

192
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,761
You guys ready to get to it?

193
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,261
>> Yeah.

194
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:27,720
>> Absolutely.

195
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,471
>> PROBST: You've been out here

196
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,348
ten days, know each other pretty

197
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,182
well.

198
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,100
Now we're going to put that

199
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:32,642
knowledge to use.

200
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,228
Today, you are going to rank

201
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,231
your tribe from top to bottom

202
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,358
according to importance in your

203
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,317
tribe.

204
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,401
One would be the highest

205
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,778
ranking; you'll work your way

206
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,570
down.

207
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,613
Once you're finished, I'll have

208
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,240
you take your spot according to

209
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,326
rank on the colored pedestal.

210
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,619
Got a tally board for each of

211
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,079
you.

212
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,206
Don't unwrap these yet.

213
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:55,748
You will fill these out in

214
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,793
private.

215
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,544
Find a spot on the beach, get

216
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,753
started.

217
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,727
>> PROBST: All right, this is

218
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,479
how you guys ranked yourselves

219
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,439
in terms of importance.

220
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,653
The person that Kota ranked as

221
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,905
the most important on their

222
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,033
tribe is Marcus.

223
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,285
>> I'm totally shocked to be

224
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:32,994
ranked number one.

225
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:33,703
I was just happy that they felt

226
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,371
that way about me.

227
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:35,913
On the other hand, are they

228
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,290
going to start thinking that

229
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,249
maybe that's a threat that

230
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,792
needs to be, uh, moved off to

231
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,711
the side as quickly as possible?

232
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,503
>> PROBST: Person voted

233
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,005
second-most important on

234
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,507
the Kota tribe: Ace.

235
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,010
Third: Bob.

236
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,762
Fourth: Charlie.

237
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,639
Fifth for the Kota tribe:

238
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,600
Jacquie.

239
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,518
Sixth: Corinne.

240
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,397
The seventh: Sugar.

241
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,523
Leaving Kelly as the least

242
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,735
valuable member of the tribe.

243
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,154
Kelly, how's it feel?

244
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,198
>> It's interesting.

245
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,282
Being the last one.

246
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,825
I've never been the last picked

247
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,745
ever, so it's kind of different.

248
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,538
>> Kelly's devastated.

249
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,915
"Why am I picked last?

250
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,249
Why is everybody not kissing my

251
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:20,750
ass?"

252
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,959
'Cause you're a whiny little

253
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,796
cow, and, um... you don't do

254
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,299
anything.

255
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,010
>> PROBST: On the number one

256
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,971
pedestal for Fang: Matty.

257
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,600
Second on the Fang tribe: Dan.

258
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,685
Third: Randy.

259
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,564
Fourth: Crystal.

260
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,441
>> What the hell?

261
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,776
I'm out there busting my butt,

262
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,194
and then they're going to rank

263
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,363
me number four after someone who

264
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,989
can't even barely walk and

265
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,074
barely do anything, and all he

266
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,825
does is sit around and fuss and

267
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,202
curse everyone?

268
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,579
I was very insulted when I saw

269
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,914
that.

270
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,123
>> PROBST: Fifth for the Fang

271
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,793
tribe: Ken.

272
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,545
Sixth: GC.

273
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:06,796
>> Wow.

274
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,298
Kenny got picked before me?

275
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,050
Damn, this is, this is not

276
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:11,634
looking too good.

277
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,677
(chuckles)

278
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,678
Yeah, this is not looking too

279
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,513
good for a pimp out here.

280
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,764
>> PROBST: Leaving Susie as the

281
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,685
least valuable tribe member.

282
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,019
So this is it.

283
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:22,645
This is how you guys ranked

284
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,648
yourselves.

285
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,732
Marcus, any surprises to you on

286
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,775
the Fang tribe?

287
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,111
>> I'm surprised Randy is up as

288
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:30,695
high as he is.

289
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,613
I really thought that we'd see a

290
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,365
girl in the top two or three on

291
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:34,907
their tribe.

292
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,785
So that comes as a surprise.

293
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,619
>> PROBST: Randy, you're

294
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,371
getting a sneak peek inside the

295
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,038
Kota tribe.

296
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,415
What kind of insight do you

297
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,499
take from this?

298
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,417
>> I really don't think

299
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,543
anything.

300
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,377
>> PROBST: Really?

301
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,004
>> I mean, this shows

302
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,505
friendliness; this shows

303
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,881
physicality in, uh, challenges,

304
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,425
but it doesn't show a thing

305
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,926
about who's hooking up with who.

306
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,722
>> PROBST: All right.

307
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,681
Well, now you're going to take

308
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,640
all this insight and put it to

309
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,685
good use because we are picking

310
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,686
new tribes.

311
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,521
>> What?!

312
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:05,855
>> No, no, no.

313
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,398
>> Oh, no.

314
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,024
Oh, wow.

315
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,234
>> PROBST: Drop your buffs.

316
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:10,735
>> No!

317
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,903
(groaning)

318
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,657
>> I had it all perfect.

319
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,993
Dan, Randy, and Susie and I

320
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,620
solidified our foursome, and I

321
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,121
was super content with it.

322
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,331
I was happy.

323
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,623
I was comfortable with that

324
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:24,874
foursome.

325
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,834
And then Jeff's like, "We're

326
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,836
going to switch teams."

327
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,880
And I was just like, "Oh, no."

328
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,797
That was just such a buzz-kill.

329
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,383
I didn't even want to hear that.

330
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,217
>> PROBST: Here's how it is

331
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,177
going to work.

332
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,719
Marcus and Matty, because

333
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,471
you were voted the most

334
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,972
important person in your tribe,

335
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:40,765
you will remain members of that

336
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,600
tribe.

337
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,225
You will be captains, and you

338
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,227
will get us started on picking

339
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,187
new tribes.

340
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,646
Marcus take a spot on the Kota

341
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,397
mat.

342
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,732
Matty, take a spot on the Fong

343
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,483
mat.

344
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,525
>> Oh, no.

345
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,151
>> PROBST: Kota will choose

346
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:52,360
first.

347
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,652
Marcus, you're now going to

348
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,363
choose somebody from the Fang

349
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:55,738
tribe.

350
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,822
Who are you going to select to

351
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,698
be your first tribe member?

352
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,201
>> I'm going to take Dan.

353
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,119
>> PROBST: Dan joins Marcus on

354
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:02,703
the new Kota tribe.

355
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,746
Matty, make your first

356
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,039
selection.

357
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:05,956
You're choosing somebody from

358
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,749
Kota.

359
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,250
>> I'm going to take Ace.

360
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,544
>> PROBST: Ace joins Matty on

361
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,796
the new Fang tribe.

362
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,171
All right, Dan.

363
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,048
You are now choosing somebody

364
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,092
from Kota.

365
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,593
>> Charlie.

366
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,261
>> PROBST: Charlie joins his old

367
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,679
teammate Marcus and his new

368
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,431
tribe member, Dan.

369
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,600
>> I am thrilled to be with

370
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:24,892
Marcus.

371
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,310
My biggest fear in this game is

372
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,478
that Marcus and I would separate

373
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,355
because we have each other's

374
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,773
backs, like...

375
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,066
I just love Marcus.

376
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,818
(laughing)

377
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,402
>> PROBST: Ace, you are now

378
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,820
choosing somebody from the Fang

379
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,862
tribe.

380
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,572
>> Since she beat me up so bad,

381
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,031
Crystal, come on down.

382
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,408
>> PROBST: Crystal, first woman

383
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:40,741
selected.

384
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,785
Charlie, you are now choosing

385
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,495
somebody from Fang.

386
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:44,954
>> Randy.

387
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,830
(clicking tongue)

388
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,414
>> PROBST: Randy on the new

389
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:46,956
Kota.

390
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,707
>> PROBST: Crystal, you are

391
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,917
choosing somebody from the Kota

392
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,377
tribe.

393
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,546
>> I'm going to go with Jacquie.

394
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,297
>> PROBST: Jacquie joins

395
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,633
Crystal, Matty, and Ace.

396
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,175
Randy, you are now choosing

397
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,678
somebody from the Kota tribe.

398
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,929
>> Corinne.

399
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,722
>> PROBST: Corinne joins Marcus

400
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,683
and Charlie, Dan, and Randy.

401
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,851
Jacquie, you are now choosing

402
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,727
somebody from the Fang tribe.

403
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,187
>> I'm going to go with Ken.

404
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,647
>> PROBST: Ken joins Matty,

405
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,441
Crystal, Ace, and Jacquie.

406
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,151
All right, Corinne, your choice.

407
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,610
Are you choosing somebody from

408
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:16,819
Fang.

409
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,155
You have only two choices:

410
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,532
GC, who was ranked number six,

411
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,200
or Susie, who is ranked last.

412
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,252
>> It doesn't matter who they

413
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:33,669
pick; it's a game.

414
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,670
>> PROBST: All right, Corinne.

415
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,504
I hope the information you're

416
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,839
getting is good info.

417
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,965
>> Well, I don't want to be the

418
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,633
only girl, so we're going to

419
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,342
take Susie.

420
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,177
Come on over.

421
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,052
>> PROBST: Corinne chooses

422
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,764
Susie, leaving GC as the last

423
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,017
remaining member of Fang.

424
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,146
GC, nobody chose you.

425
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,981
>> Well, it's cool.

426
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:54,231
You know.

427
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,983
It doesn't feel good.

428
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,359
But the last few days have been

429
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,944
pretty hard for me, and I think

430
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,279
I probably rubbed a few people

431
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,739
the wrong way.

432
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,281
>> PROBST: All right, Ken,

433
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,617
you're now making a selection.

434
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,910
You're choosing between three

435
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,370
remaining Kota members, Bob,

436
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,498
Sugar, and Kelly.

437
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,125
>> I don't know Kelly.

438
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,003
>> No?

439
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,714
>> PROBST: Bob still left up

440
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,381
there.

441
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,841
Bob, a little surprised?

442
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,593
You were ranked so high by your

443
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,011
own tribe, and yet nobody's

444
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,721
chosen you?

445
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,139
Are you a diamond in the rough?

446
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,057
Are they missing some gold here?

447
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,850
>> Um...

448
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,977
I think so, but that...

449
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,231
You know, time will tell.

450
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,617
>> PROBST: All right, Ken, make

451
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,035
your choice.

452
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,870
>> Jeff, for myself, I've always

453
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,622
been last picked sometimes and

454
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,790
I know how it feels to be left

455
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,124
out, so I'm going to go with

456
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:54,833
Kelly.

457
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,417
I want to get to know her, and

458
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,460
she's hot.

459
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,753
(laughter)

460
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,713
>> PROBST: That may be the most

461
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,674
surprising decision in ten days

462
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,175
out here, Ken.

463
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,761
Susie, you're choosing between

464
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,096
Bob, ranked the third most

465
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,973
valuable tribe member, or

466
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,016
Sugar, ranked next to last.

467
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,393
>> I'm going to go with Bob.

468
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,436
>> PROBST: Finally, Bob joins

469
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,230
Susie, Marcus, Charlie,

470
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,898
Corinne, Dan, and Randy.

471
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,025
>> PROBST: Kelly, you have one

472
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,110
choice.

473
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,195
>> G-Sizzle.

474
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,655
>> G-Sizzle!

475
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,948
Come back home.

476
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,866
>> PROBST: GC joins Kelly,

477
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,036
Matty, Ken, Crystal, Ace, and

478
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,663
Jacquie.

479
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,206
The new Fang tribe, which

480
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,333
leaves you, Sugar.

481
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,543
>> What does that mean?

482
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,168
>> PROBST: You will go to Exile

483
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,587
Island.

484
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,713
>> Aah!

485
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,340
>> Oh, no!

486
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,675
>> PROBST: You will remain on

487
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,635
Exile until after the next

488
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,345
Tribal Council.

489
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,222
You will then join the tribe

490
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,057
that loses a member, evening us

491
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,436
up at 7-7.

492
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,312
Ready to head to Exile?

493
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,438
>> Yeah.

494
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,690
>> PROBST: Here is a map.

495
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,359
Not that you don't know the way.

496
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,736
>> Bye.

497
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,445
>> PROBST: It's going to be a

498
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,154
long stay out there, Sugar.

499
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,114
>> Bye.

500
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:07,948
>> PROBST: Kota, new tribe

501
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,450
buffs.

502
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,492
Fresh, clean.

503
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,285
>> Yes!

504
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,119
>> PROBST: Fang, new tribe

505
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:12,953
buffs.

506
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,455
All right, we have our new

507
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:14,997
tribes.

508
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,123
For some of you, this is a

509
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,291
brand-new start.

510
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,751
For others, it could mean the

511
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,918
end of your game.

512
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,753
Grab your stuff.

513
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,880
Head back to camp.

514
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,484
>> You guys, this is your new

515
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,026
home.

516
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:44,735
Feel comfortable.

517
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,569
>> Welcome hone, guys.

518
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,945
>> You guys are really going to

519
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:47,821
like it here.

520
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,156
>> Oh, my God.

521
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,449
>> I'm so happy.

522
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,200
>> Look at this.

523
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,409
>> This tribe has a completely

524
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,410
different personality.

525
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,828
If Matty was here, it would be,

526
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,121
like, the perfect tribe.

527
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,581
>> The new Kota tribe is four

528
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,750
Kota members: Bob, Marcus,

529
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,209
Corinne, and Charlie;

530
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,962
three old Fang members: Susie

531
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:04,922
and Dan and me.

532
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,131
If Kota loses the next

533
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,092
challenge, I do think the

534
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:08,592
original Kota will stick

535
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,761
together and pick one of the

536
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,429
three Fang members off.

537
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,348
If it's not me, I'll go along

538
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:14,556
with it.

539
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,141
If it is me, I'll burn the camp

540
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,644
down.

541
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,144
>> This is unbelievable.

542
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,480
It's, like, the most comfortable

543
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,272
thing I've sat on in a week.

544
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,148
>> Bob works in his sleep, too.

545
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:23,899
He wakes up every hour.

546
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:24,525
>> Yeah, Bob wakes up in the

547
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,192
middle of the night and builds

548
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:25,859
stuff.

549
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,485
He's going to build us some

550
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:26,902
bunk beds, I think.

551
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:27,986
>> Unbelievable.

552
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,445
>> He's awesome, Bob.

553
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,280
The Kota tribe has it together.

554
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,198
They're just functioning really

555
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,366
well.

556
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,243
I see Bob is their worker, and

557
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,161
I think Marcus and Corinne and

558
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,538
Charlie, they really appreciate

559
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:37,746
that.

560
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,582
So, my strategy right now at

561
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,250
Kota is to just keep working

562
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,127
hard at camp.

563
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,753
And I'm hoping that they see

564
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,295
that as a positive and say,

565
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,214
"She's worth keeping."

566
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,936
>> Comfort time!

567
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,229
When I got to Exile, there was

568
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,189
a choice between comfort and

569
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:04,982
the clue.

570
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,191
And I already have the idol, so

571
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,736
I chose comfort.

572
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,280
Home, sweet home.

573
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,198
I walked up to my Sugar shack.

574
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,284
It was like Christmas morning.

575
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,745
There was pineapple and oranges

576
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,872
and apples and coconut.

577
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:24,710
Oh, my God.

578
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,795
This is so good.

579
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,922
(laughing)

580
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,218
(sighs)

581
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,930
This game is so crazy because

582
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,140
I don't know what team I'm going

583
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,933
to be on when I get back.

584
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,310
I'm hoping that I go back to

585
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,022
Fang, so that I can be with Ace.

586
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,024
And hopefully they'll vote off

587
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,442
Kelly, and then I can come take

588
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,568
her spot.

589
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,152
I'm sure they will.

590
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,279
They're not idiots.

591
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,126
>> All right, guys.

592
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,836
Welcome to Fang!

593
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,545
>> I like it.

594
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,588
>> This is our home.

595
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,297
>> Is it different than your

596
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,090
guys' house?

597
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:12,716
>> Yeah.

598
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,383
>> Really?

599
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:13,884
>> I mean, the hut looks

600
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,177
similar.

601
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,595
>> This tribe switch is great

602
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:16,845
for me.

603
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,014
I still got four people of my

604
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,016
original tribe, and I think it

605
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:21,892
is great, you know what I mean?

606
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,601
I don't think I could be in a

607
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,393
better position right now.

608
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,686
>> If we walk around and pull

609
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,938
ginger, you can cut the root

610
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,147
and you can put it right into

611
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:27,773
the rice.

612
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,148
>> Yeah.

613
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:28,982
>> Same with the watercress.

614
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:29,483
>> Oh, yeah, and ferns.

615
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,526
>> We can't find the ginger.

616
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,777
>> Oh, I can show you it.

617
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,320
>> Oh!

618
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,739
Thank you! Thank you!

619
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,866
>> Yeah.

620
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,304
>> Because you guys didn't

621
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,014
really invite anybody else with

622
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:05,352
you guys wherever you went.

623
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,353
>> Listening to Kelly talk, she

624
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,647
felt like an outcast.

625
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,982
She felt like she needed to

626
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,733
belong somewhere, and maybe she

627
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,861
really does belong with Fang.

628
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,530
>> I was starting to count down

629
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,199
the days and the hours.

630
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,617
>> Not much we can do, but...

631
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,919
>> Yeah.

632
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,795
>> I don't know, it's so weird.

633
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,796
They are just so fake.

634
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,923
Like, I'm a salesperson.

635
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,633
I know I can analyze people and,

636
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,134
like, get along with all

637
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,135
personalities.

638
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,303
And even change my personality,

639
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,429
and act like something

640
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:40,721
sometimes.

641
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,723
But, to them, it was just like,

642
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,433
I would sit there and just,

643
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,809
like, listen to them.

644
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,435
I definitely would rather jump

645
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,021
ship and go with Fang than I

646
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,022
would with old Kota.

647
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:50,606
'Cause, you know what?

648
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,231
They didn't even give me a

649
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,065
chance.

650
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,693
And I think Crystal and G-Sizzle

651
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,029
and Ken have something going on.

652
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,030
So, I definitely want to be a

653
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:58,822
part of that because they

654
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,489
overrule all the votes.

655
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,327
>> What you see.

656
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,411
(imitating): "Cool, awesome!"

657
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,288
"What's up? Like, cool!"

658
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,418
>> Oh, he's got two.

659
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,294
>> Oh, he pimp daddy.

660
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,338
>> Sweet!

661
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,883
>> He's pimp daddy Ace.

662
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,133
>> Yeah.

663
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:18,634
>> Yeah.

664
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,595
>> Oh, my God. Duh. My girl.

665
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,640
>> Uh, cha-ching.

666
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,141
>> Okay, it can be done.

667
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:26,683
>> That's money in the bank.

668
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,060
>> The numbers are here.

669
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,686
>> When I saw Kelly on that mat

670
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,771
and she was the last one picked,

671
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,190
I knew I could sway her to my

672
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,608
side because she did not get

673
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,401
along with Kota.

674
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,986
Oh, yeah, she's also hot.

675
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,904
There you go.

676
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,823
>> I know.

677
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,699
I'm so happy that I get to,

678
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,867
like, talk, and you guys, like,

679
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,785
talk back.

680
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,120
>> Right now, I am only using

681
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,247
her for a vote.

682
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,601
>> We got tree mail!

683
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,852
>> Oh, my God.

684
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,812
It's a lacrosse stick.

685
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,105
>> Oh, crap.

686
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:13,522
>> Is that a ball?

687
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,439
>> Yeah.

688
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,065
>> Aw!

689
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,441
>> "Practice, practice, shoot

690
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,234
and toss.

691
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,360
Like water polo meets lacrosse,

692
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,904
Time to show them who is boss,

693
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,364
You can never afford an

694
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,532
immunity loss."

695
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,201
I really am trying physically

696
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:27,744
to try my best, but, man, this

697
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,578
game takes a toll on a

698
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,205
47-year-old woman like me.

699
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:30,747
(laughs)

700
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,249
It just does.

701
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:32,874
>> You use your left hand and

702
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,667
your right.

703
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,085
It will go faster.

704
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,878
Here, somebody else can try.

705
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,088
>> I don't know that Randy and

706
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:38,672
Susie can really pull their

707
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,465
weight when it comes to the

708
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,675
challenges themselves.

709
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,467
I think it will be really hard

710
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,469
to put Randy out before Susie,

711
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,972
but it's certainly not out of

712
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:47,764
the question.

713
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,141
Susie is doing a great job

714
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:49,850
around camp.

715
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,184
And if Randy has a poor

716
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:51,768
performance on a challenge and

717
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,020
he's not really doing much

718
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,229
around camp, shoot, I would

719
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:55,313
rather keep Susie around.

720
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,690
The question will really be,

721
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,400
"How does Randy perform when it

722
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,402
comes time to do the

723
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,612
challenges?"

724
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,407
(all laughing)

725
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,534
>> Randy.

726
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,503
>> PROBST: You guys ready to

727
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,046
get to today's challenge?

728
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,338
>> Yes.

729
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,131
>> PROBST: First things first.

730
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:25,552
GC, take back immunity.

731
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,805
Once again, immunity is back up

732
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,223
for grabs.

733
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,433
For today's challenge, you will

734
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,810
each have a raft and a paddle.

735
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,561
On my go, I'll toss a ball into

736
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,395
the water.

737
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,272
You will race to gain

738
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,648
possession of the ball.

739
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,067
Using your paddles, you will

740
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,651
pass the ball from one tribe

741
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,195
mate to another until you are

742
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,946
close enough that you can toss

743
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,323
the ball into your opponent's

744
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:46,948
goal, scoring a point for your

745
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,407
tribe.

746
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,577
First tribe to three wins

747
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,704
immunity, is safe in this game.

748
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,455
Losers go to Tribal Council

749
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,957
where the fourth person will be

750
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,917
voted out.

751
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,293
Make sense?

752
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,127
>> ALL: Yes.

753
00:22:59,211 --> 00:22:59,753
>> PROBST: We'll get you in the

754
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,962
boats.

755
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,631
We'll get started.

756
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:07,886
All right, here we go.

757
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,346
For immunity.

758
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,597
It takes three points to win.

759
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,059
Survivors ready?

760
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,186
Go!

761
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,149
These boats are not easy to

762
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,359
control.

763
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:22,984
Maneuvering is going to be half

764
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,654
the battle.

765
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,364
Your goal is to pass from one

766
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,740
tribe mate to another until you

767
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,743
are close enough to score.

768
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,203
>> That's my girl!

769
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,371
>> PROBST: Jacquie going to get

770
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,581
to the ball first for Fang.

771
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,625
Jacquie has it, loses it

772
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,379
quickly.

773
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,463
Jacquie struggling now to get

774
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,923
back to it.

775
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,341
Marcus taking his time, scoops

776
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,301
it up easily.

777
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,387
Ace in the goalie position.

778
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,555
Marcus just moving it down,

779
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,099
nobody even attacking Marcus.

780
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,225
Crystal just watching.

781
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,268
>> Get it, Ken!

782
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,144
>> PROBST: Kelly not doing

783
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,061
anything.

784
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,855
Kenny can't do anything.

785
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,189
Marcus passes in closer to

786
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,275
Randy.

787
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,109
Randy's got it.

788
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,402
Going to take a shot at the

789
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,945
goal, and he scores!

790
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:07,946
Just like that.

791
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,697
>> Take that!

792
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,198
Let's go! Come on!

793
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,200
>> PROBST: Kota on the board.

794
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:12,784
>> That's a boy, Randy!

795
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,001
>> PROBST: Here we go.

796
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:21,877
Kota leads, 1-zip.

797
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,878
Playing to three.

798
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,464
Survivors ready?

799
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,509
Go!

800
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,344
Matty out quickly for Fang.

801
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:31,928
>> Come on, Matty! Get to it!

802
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:32,554
>> PROBST: Marcus fighting to

803
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,848
get there first.

804
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,850
Kelly making no progress.

805
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,226
Ace now out of the goalie

806
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,728
spot using his hands.

807
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,565
He's now out on the course.

808
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,858
Marcus going to get there first

809
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:49,696
for Kota.

810
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,364
Marcus with a nice little pass

811
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,201
to himself.

812
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,243
Marcus like he's done this

813
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,828
before.

814
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,746
>> Kelly, get up there, too!

815
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,705
>> Kelly!

816
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,000
Kelly, the ball!

817
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,418
>> Come on, Kelly! Get to it!

818
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,336
>> Get over there, Randy.

819
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,128
>> Randy's open!

820
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,004
>> Take your time.

821
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:06,630
Take your time.

822
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,550
>> PROBST: Kelly not doing much.

823
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,969
Marcus passes down to Randy.

824
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,471
He's got a free goal if he can

825
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:14,763
get to it.

826
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,348
>> Randy, go!

827
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,307
>> PROBST: Nobody on the Fang

828
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,350
goal!

829
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,060
How does that happen?

830
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,394
>> Yes!

831
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,312
>> PROBST: Kota scores their

832
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,521
second point.

833
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,481
>> Nice, guys, nice!

834
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,357
>> Good job!

835
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,399
>> PROBST: Fang could not make

836
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,651
that easier!

837
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:33,031
>> I can't control the boat.

838
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,074
>> PROBST: Here we go.

839
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,116
Kota leads 2-zip.

840
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,077
It only takes three to win.

841
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,539
Survivors ready?

842
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,666
Go!

843
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,300
Marcus once again out quickly

844
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,094
for Kota.

845
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,304
Ace racing to get possession.

846
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:56,888
Marcus once again gets to the

847
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,848
ball first.

848
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,600
>> Nice, Ace, get to it!

849
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,604
>> PROBST: Trying to control it.

850
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,900
Loses it to Ace.

851
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,943
Ace having trouble getting back

852
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,529
to it.

853
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,656
Kelly just hanging back.

854
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,412
Marcus tosses it between

855
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,622
Kenny and Crystal and now

856
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,959
Marcus is going to pass Kenny.

857
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:26,835
>> Come on, Kenny, go!

858
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,836
>> PROBST: Kenny virtually

859
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,590
useless in this challenge.

860
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,633
>> Ace, yeah!

861
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,927
>> Atta, boys!

862
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,178
>> PROBST: Ace coming to get in

863
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,555
on this.

864
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,472
>> Marcus, do it!

865
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,098
>> Watch out. Ace is behind you.

866
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,517
>> PROBST: No hands!

867
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,560
>> Let's go, Marcus!

868
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,186
>> Give it to me, man.

869
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,187
>> PROBST: Marcus tosses to

870
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,356
Randy down close.

871
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,317
Randy's got a shot on goal.

872
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,776
>> Randy, go for it!

873
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,902
>> You've got this, Randy.

874
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,737
>> PROBST: This could do it.

875
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,696
No, just short.

876
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,657
>> Yeah, Matty!

877
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,492
>> PROBST: Dan and Matty

878
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,118
fighting for that ball right at

879
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,078
the goal.

880
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,581
No, Matty with a great block!

881
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,206
Dan, you're out of your boat.

882
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,666
You're not in it until you're

883
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,667
back in your boat.

884
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,960
>> Get to that corner!

885
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:09,794
>> Oh, my God!

886
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,547
Go, Randy!

887
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,590
>> PROBST: Ace knocks it out

888
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,507
of Randy.

889
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,134
Now Ace is out of his boat.

890
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:16,968
>> Yeah!

891
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:17,761
>> PROBST: Randy scores for

892
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,720
Kota!

893
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:18,928
>> Yeah!

894
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,056
>> PROBST: Kota wins immunity.

895
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,225
>> Yes, yeah!

896
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,810
>> Whoo!

897
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,853
>> PROBST: One of the most

898
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,273
lopsided challenges thus far.

899
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,863
Kota, congratulations.

900
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,741
Immunity and no Tribal Council.

901
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,745
>> Thanks, Jeff.

902
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,205
>> PROBST: Fang, without

903
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,539
question, one of the worst

904
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,458
performances I've seen at a

905
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,584
challenge.

906
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,126
I got nothing for you except

907
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,711
a date with me tonight at Tribal

908
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,962
Council where today's

909
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,881
performance will cost somebody

910
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,176
a shot at a million dollars.

911
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,135
That's what you have to figure

912
00:27:59,219 --> 00:27:59,886
out this afternoon.

913
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:00,929
Grab your stuff.

914
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,971
Head back to camp.

915
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,099
See you at Tribal.

916
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,603
Kota, congratulations.

917
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,396
Grab your stuff.

918
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,523
Head back to camp.

919
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:34,087
>> (tribal chanting)

920
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,506
(yawning fiercely)

921
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,818
>> The immunity challenge was

922
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,862
so much fun.

923
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,530
It was like we were legless

924
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,408
chickens racing against sleek

925
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,993
weasels and losing badly

926
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,620
along the way.

927
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,663
>> It seemed like the plan

928
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:11,583
failed from the very start.

929
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,000
>> Kenny, you okay?

930
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,211
>> Yeah, I mean, I was...

931
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,255
>> Kenny, you sucked out there.

932
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,006
>> I'm sorry.

933
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,966
>> Kenny, you were stuck in the

934
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,176
same spot.

935
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,427
>> I don't understand how that

936
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,303
worked.

937
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,220
Like, 'cause I kept on turning

938
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,263
around in circles.

939
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,514
>> That was bad.

940
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,475
That was bad, Kenny.

941
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,309
>> You were pretty good,

942
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,602
Jacquie.

943
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,479
>> It's hard to play defense

944
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:32,812
in that game.

945
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,898
Should've, could've,

946
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,026
would've.

947
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,986
>> Over it.

948
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,240
>> Originally we were thinking

949
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,783
about voting for Ace or Jacquie

950
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,243
tonight, but judging by the way

951
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,496
that Kelly performed today,

952
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,079
Kelly's going home tonight is

953
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:50,872
what I'm thinking.

954
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,040
Um, I'm going to talk to the

955
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,750
others.

956
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,375
I'm going to talk to Kenny and

957
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,419
Crystal, and I'm sure everybody

958
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,712
will be fine with voting Kelly

959
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,881
out tonight.

960
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,553
>> So, G, what do you think?

961
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,014
>> I don't know.

962
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,975
I think, uh...

963
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,060
I think we should definitely

964
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,061
keep Ace.

965
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,270
He's, uh, you seen him today.

966
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,980
Yeah, I mean, um, but I think,

967
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,066
I mean, maybe we should switch

968
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,858
it to Kelly, man.

969
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,152
She kind of has a bad attitude

970
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,988
about stuff and she... Jacquie

971
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,366
did at least all right today.

972
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,617
Are you all cool with that?

973
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,619
>> I'm good with Kelly.

974
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,662
I'll put it out.

975
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,205
>> I don't want to lose no more.

976
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,920
>> The dangerous thing about

977
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,881
that is, if, if Sugar has the

978
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,717
immunity idol, I think she'll

979
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,094
be more than likely to give it

980
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,763
to Ace than to Jacquie.

981
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,890
She won't give it to Kelly.

982
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,855
>> That's the only flip side.

983
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,815
>> And who knows if she even

984
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,691
has it.

985
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,525
>> I know.

986
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,526
Like, voting Kelly tonight, it

987
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,318
would be a risk.

988
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,027
>> Yeah, if we vote off Kelly

989
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,028
tonight...

990
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,489
>> It would be a risk.

991
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,865
>> The deal was, whoever lost

992
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,325
the immunity challenge, ends up

993
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:09,951
picking up Sugar.

994
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,995
And, unfortunately, that's us.

995
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,080
She could have the immunity

996
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,790
idol and the last thing we

997
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:16,916
want is for Ace, Sugar and

998
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,043
Jacquie to become the power in

999
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,211
this tribe.

1000
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,089
So, what's the deal?

1001
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:23,965
>> No.

1002
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:24,299
>> Not Kelly?

1003
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:24,966
Jacquie?

1004
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,427
>> Yeah, Jacquie.

1005
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,636
>> Because if Sugar comes here

1006
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,220
with the immunity idol, it'll

1007
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,055
take...

1008
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,307
>> She'll share it among

1009
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,141
those three.

1010
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:33,474
>> With Jacquie.

1011
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,058
>> She was close to Jacquie

1012
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,852
and Ace.

1013
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,686
>> Which means they'll have

1014
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,980
three.

1015
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,398
>> I don't want him to have any

1016
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,691
kind of power in our tribe,

1017
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,150
not even three.

1018
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,028
The closest he'll have is two.

1019
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,070
>> Nah, tell us how you feel.

1020
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,822
>> I think Kelly.

1021
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:48,573
I think Kelly's the weakest

1022
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,324
link.

1023
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,074
We were gonna vote out Sue next.

1024
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:50,658
What's the difference in Sue

1025
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,868
and Kelly?

1026
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:52,660
Not a damn thing.

1027
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,203
>> The difference is, uh, Sugar

1028
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,038
may have the immunity idol.

1029
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,166
Ace, Sugar, and Jacquie-- those

1030
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,961
three right now is real deadly.

1031
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,172
>> You cool?

1032
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,257
>> Yeah.

1033
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,016
>> I was talking to Crystal,

1034
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,934
GC, and Kenny.

1035
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,519
So I go... so I go, "We can't

1036
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,646
rid of the strong people; we

1037
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,855
can't get rid off the strong

1038
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,231
people; there's no way," and he

1039
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,232
started to believe me.

1040
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,525
And then they wanted... then

1041
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,610
they were talking about taking

1042
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:26,944
out you, and I was, like, "No,

1043
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,487
no, no, we can't take out

1044
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,196
Jacquie, she's too strong, she's

1045
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,989
too strong, she's too strong,"

1046
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:30,615
but they're, like, worried that

1047
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,325
you and Ace are allied, so when

1048
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,618
what's-her-face comes back that

1049
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,161
you and him are gonna be

1050
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:35,912
allied...

1051
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,537
>> Matty told me that everybody

1052
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,205
assumes that Sugar's gonna have

1053
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,122
the idol coming back 'cause

1054
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,040
she'll be out there for four

1055
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,249
days now.

1056
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,584
And they all want to vote me

1057
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,628
out.

1058
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,253
I'm feeling totally on the outs

1059
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,672
right now.

1060
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,799
I'm really, really nervous.

1061
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,225
>> I work off my ass off in the

1062
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,559
challenges.

1063
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,104
>> People are scared.

1064
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,480
>> But you guys would still

1065
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,356
help, like...

1066
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,691
>> No, it's not that.

1067
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,818
It's just, like...

1068
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,476
>> I want to be with you guys.

1069
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,145
'Cause I'm on the outskirts of

1070
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,104
anything, so if I try even to

1071
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,898
join with Ace and Sugar, I know

1072
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,482
they're not gonna bring me to

1073
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,776
the end.

1074
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,653
>> Jacquie seems very genuine.

1075
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,279
After I had a talk with Jacquie,

1076
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,740
I kind of wanted to go take out

1077
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,198
Kelly before Jacquie.

1078
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,242
If we make the wrong choice

1079
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,201
right now, it will hurt really

1080
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,119
bad later.

1081
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,955
So my mind is not made up right

1082
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,165
now.

1083
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,336
I can try to vote for Kelly

1084
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,589
tonight, but... it's not gonna

1085
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,256
do anything.

1086
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,883
You really need to talk to

1087
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,010
Crystal.

1088
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,515
>> It sucks.

1089
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,141
So, I just... like, I was, like,

1090
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,435
"Well, is there any way that I

1091
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,728
could get in, like, a tight

1092
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,771
alliance with you guys," you

1093
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:25,188
know?

1094
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,731
>> We thought you and... you and

1095
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,274
Ace were fairly close.

1096
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,318
>> We never had an alliance.

1097
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,986
It would be awesome if we had,

1098
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,279
like, a really strong united...

1099
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,947
>> You did a... you did a hell

1100
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,656
of a job today.

1101
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,783
>> I worked my ass off, and I,

1102
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,867
like, actually<i> want</i> to be here.

1103
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,868
>> Yeah, you played your ass

1104
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,577
off.

1105
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,244
>> Thank you.

1106
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:40,745
>> I was, like, "Damn."

1107
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,956
>> I want to be here so bad...

1108
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,124
>> Jacquie is a nervous wreck.

1109
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,125
Jacquie was just pretty much

1110
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:46,709
begging and pleading with me,

1111
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,503
"Crystal, please keep me in the

1112
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:48,711
game.

1113
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,921
I've tried so hard.

1114
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,964
I want to be here."

1115
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,966
>> ...close with GC and Kenny?

1116
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,717
>> Yeah.

1117
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,718
>> 'Cause you guys need a

1118
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,135
fourth.

1119
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,386
>> Yeah, that's the thing.

1120
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,679
>> I want to be the fourth so

1121
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,890
bad, please... (laughs)

1122
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,266
>> And the whole time she's

1123
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,601
talking to me, she's-she's

1124
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,228
welling up and she is pulling at

1125
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:05,603
my heartstrings.

1126
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,230
You know, because I'm, like,

1127
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,272
"Damn, this girl played her ass

1128
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,732
off today, and maybe she really

1129
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,775
does want to be here."

1130
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,027
>> I would be with you guys till

1131
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,569
the end.

1132
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,196
So anyways, I just wanted to

1133
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,531
talk to you 'cause I didn't get

1134
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,281
to talk to you.

1135
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,533
And I'm, like... I'm, like,

1136
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,159
"Kenny, I feel like...

1137
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,912
