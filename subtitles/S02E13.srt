1
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:05,255
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:10,927
The Barramundi camp was washed
away by a flash flood.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,388
>> RODGER: Oh, God.
>> ELISABETH: Wow.

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,766
>> TINA: I saw the devastation,
and my first thought was, you

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,644
know, that's our home.
>> COLBY: It wiped everything

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,187
out, you know, including a good
portion of everybody's emotional

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,275
steam.
>> ELISABETH: Because this group

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,276
has really endured a lot, it's
tough to have to go and cast a

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,990
vote.
>> JEFF: At tribal council, the

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,117
Ogakor alliance turned on one of
their own, making Amber the 11th

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,079
person voted out.
Five remain.

12
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:47,130
Who will be the next to go?
>> RODGER: Going to try to get

13
00:00:47,213 --> 00:02:14,259
Who will be the next to go?
>> RODGER: Going to try to get

14
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,510
everything cleaned off this
beach.

15
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,054
We never know when we're going
to have another torrential rain

16
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,722
like we had a couple of days
ago.

17
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:31,025
It took out everything.
>> ELISABETH: I woke up this

18
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,151
morning, and I was so wet on one
side.

19
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,072
I'm like, "Did I go to the
bathroom in my sleep," like, I

20
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,616
couldn't... I don't think I've
ever had that feeling because my

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,453
left side was just soaked from
the ground.

22
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,872
>> KEITH: It rained a lot last
night and our new shelter

23
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,041
leaked.
I didn't sleep all night.

24
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,544
Everyone was a little drained
this morning.

25
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,466
>> COLBY: The closer you get to
the end, the more you think

26
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,263
about what's waiting for you
when you leave, be it food, be

27
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,473
it your family, your bed, your
pillow.

28
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,520
>> TINA: I miss my husband and
my children more than anything.

29
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm still kind of a newlywed.
I've only been married just a

30
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,402
year and a half, and my husband
is my very best friend.

31
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:20,033
And I miss picking my kids up
from school and having my son

32
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,577
happy to see me.
And I just miss everything about

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,123
them.
>> COLBY: With the storm that

34
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,417
came through and the shelter,
that's the worst I've seen Tina.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,795
She was at a rock bottom.
But Elisabeth's been that way

36
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,339
for awhile.
Physically, Elisabeth's run

37
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,092
down, and emotionally, and she's
the one we've all tried to

38
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,094
nurture a little bit.
>> RODGER: I wish we had a

39
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,512
couple days without any rain,
that's what I wish.

40
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,391
It'd be nice.
>> ELISABETH: I woke up this

41
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,811
morning wet and still trying to
recover from being really

42
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,481
hungry.
The past four days really

43
00:03:51,564 --> 00:04:00,865
wrecked me.
>> COLBY: See what our tree mail

44
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,954
says today.
>> KEITH: Oh, my gosh.

45
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,372
>> RODGER: Let's hold the end of
it.

46
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,501
>> COLBY: "For 34 days on
yourself you've relied.

47
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,545
It's your strength and your wits
that the challenge has tried.

48
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,675
Now you will trust in your loved
one or mom if you hope to win at

49
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,970
Survivor.com.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.

50
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,388
E-mail?
>> COLBY: Oh, my gosh, we get to

51
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,556
compete against each other with
our loved ones online.

52
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,893
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God!
You guys, this is awesome!

53
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,228
>> KEITH: Yeah!
>> COLBY: I've got chills right

54
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,355
now.
>> ELISABETH: I can't even

55
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:37,068
contain myself!
I can't even contain myself!

56
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,486
>> KEITH: Relax.
>> ELISABETH: I can't.

57
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,447
I can't.
The e-mail said that we will

58
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,535
rely on our loved one or my mom.
My mom is the... she's my hero,

59
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:51,207
like, she is just the most
amazing, strong woman.

60
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,087
She got through breast cancer
and chemo like a trouper, and

61
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,215
any time I think that things get
tough out here, I know what

62
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:02,552
she's been through.
She's my hero.

63
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:08,558
And with her, I can do anything.
Let's go get ready.

64
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:21,237
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.
Welcome to the Outback Internet

65
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,407
Cafe--<i> Survivor</i> style.
>> COLBY: Whoo!

66
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,244
>> JEFF: Thanks to technology,
you're about to chat online with

67
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,746
your loved ones.
>> KEITH: Oh, isn't that

68
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,249
amazing.
>> JEFF: In fact, how well you

69
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:36,753
do in this challenge will really
be all up to your loved ones,

70
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,421
because they're going to be
playing this game right along

71
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,590
with you.
One at a time, you're going to

72
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,426
ask them a series of survival
trivia questions.

73
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,553
The loved one who answers the
most questions correctly will

74
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:50,391
determine which of you will win.
For the winner, a private 30-

75
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,728
minute chat with your loved ones
online.

76
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,146
When the winner's done chatting,
I'm going to give you this Visa

77
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,399
card.
$500 spending limit, where you

78
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,943
can buy whatever you want for
your loved ones.

79
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,779
Point, click, shop, 24 hours
later, they'll have a package

80
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,783
delivered.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.

81
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,951
Oh, my God.
>> JEFF: It wouldn't really be a

82
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,121
true Internet cafe if we didn't
have coffee and a Danish.

83
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,458
So as each of you come up here
to say your initial hellos, I'll

84
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,627
pour you a cup of coffee, pick
your favorite Danish.

85
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,088
All right, Tina, let's start
with you.

86
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,673
You look eager to say hi.
Have a seat.

87
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,551
Want a nice coffee?
>> TINA: Sure.

88
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,930
>> JEFF: And help yourself to a
Danish.

89
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,516
You have your husband Dale and
your son Taylor and your

90
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,521
daughter Katie.
>> TINA: Hello, family.

91
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,817
I sure miss you.
>> There she is.

92
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,488
That's your mom right there.
"Hello, family."

93
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:51,494
Hey, babe.
We love you and we...

94
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:56,666
>> TINA: Dale must be typing.
"Hel... lo."

95
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,295
>> T and K.
Cool.

96
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,674
>> TINA: "Hey, babe.
We love and miss you.

97
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,635
You go, girl.
Taylor, Dale and Katie."

98
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,179
>> JEFF: All right, Elisabeth,
come on up.

99
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,640
Okay, here's who's at home
waiting for you: your mom

100
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,685
Elisabeth, your dad Kenneth and
your brother Ken.

101
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,354
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.
>> JEFF: I'm sensing a pattern

102
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,649
there.
>> ELISABETH: I love you

103
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,486
bunches.
Miss you more.

104
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,658
Safe and sound.
Love, Bessy.

105
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:35,872
Okay.
Send, okay.

106
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,541
>> It's Elisabeth.
"Love you bunches, miss you

107
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,919
more, safe and sound.
Love, Bessy."

108
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,677
>> ELISABETH: "Elisabeth, I
can't believe it's you.

109
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,346
Dad's here, Kenny is here.
What's happening there?"

110
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,309
I can't tell you.
Love you.

111
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,768
>> JEFF: Rodger, come on up.
Welcome.

112
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,438
>> RODGER: Thank you, buddy.
>> JEFF: Let me tell you who

113
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,939
you're talking to.
Your wife Pat, your daughter

114
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,816
Angela...
>> RODGER: Good.

115
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,568
>> JEFF: ...and your son-in-law
Kevin.

116
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:13,701
>> RODGER: Good.
Okay.

117
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,079
>> There it is.
>> "Hello, family.

118
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,918
Doing good.
I love you guys."

119
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,503
>> JEFF: Is that a little tear
in your eye?

120
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,797
>> RODGER: Yes, sir, it is.
Yep.

121
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,805
Here we go.
>> COLBY: What are they saying,

122
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:42,104
Rodge?
>> RODGER: How about you read

123
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,733
that?
>> JEFF: I'll read it for you.

124
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,444
"We are doing good.
We miss you and are very proud

125
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,656
of you."
>> RODGER: Whoo.

126
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,782
>> ELISABETH: Worth the wait,
Rodger.

127
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,826
>> RODGER: I knew I should have
brought my sunglasses.

128
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,788
>> JEFF: Come on up, Keith.
All right, Keith, Katrin ring a

129
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:05,127
bell?
Your sweetie?

130
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,130
She's there, waiting to hear
from you.

131
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,808
>> KEITH: We call each other
Peas and Carrots.

132
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,645
Hello, Peas, miss you so much.
I'll never be gone this long

133
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:27,275
from you again.
I love you.

134
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:42,373
>> Hello, Carrots.
You can call me Sweet Pea.

135
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,710
>> JEFF: Right on cue, huh?
>> "Hello, Carrots, you can call

136
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:51,132
me Sweet Pea.
I love you, too."

137
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:56,387
>> JEFF: Have a seat, Colby.
Help yourself to a Danish.

138
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,055
You've got Gaye, your mom.
>> COLBY: No way.

139
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,684
>> RODGER: Oh, wow.
>> COLBY: Sweet.

140
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,979
Hey, gang.
The Colbster is still alive.

141
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,316
I love you.
The best thing about this is

142
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,694
just being able to let her know
I'm still okay.

143
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,030
We're best friends, and it's so
much more than just a mother-son

144
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,492
relationship.
She's everything.

145
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:45,394
My mom just said, "Hi, baby."
She always calls me her baby boy

146
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,731
because my brother's older than
I am.

147
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,067
(<i> sighs</i> )
That's what I needed, right

148
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,404
there.
>> RODGER: I guess you guys

149
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,907
realize that us three men fell
apart worse than any of the

150
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,702
women did.
Very big strong men.

151
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,412
>> COLBY: I was pretty composed
until she responded.

152
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,622
>> RODGER: That was the way with
me.

153
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,873
>> COLBY: I thought I was doing
good until those words came

154
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,875
across the screen.
>> RODGER: Once the words came

155
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:13,964
up, that was it for me.
>> JEFF: Okay, let's start the

156
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,092
challenge.
Here's the deal: you're going to

157
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,470
each ask the same set of five
questions to your family.

158
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,223
The winner will be the person
whose family answers the most

159
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,559
questions correctly.
Tina, you're up.

160
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,769
Read off the questions and hit
"send."

161
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:31,065
>> TINA: Oh, my gosh, this is a
good question for all of us.

162
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,276
"In the Southern Hemisphere...
>> The sun rises in which

163
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,739
direction?"
It always rises in the east.

164
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,909
East is "C."
Question number two...

165
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,910
>> ELISABETH: "True or false,
the emu is the largest bird in

166
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,956
the world."
>> "The emu is the largest bird

167
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,459
in the world."
Okay, true.

168
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,961
Number three.
I have to get back to the

169
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:56,298
question.
>> RODGER: Question three: "Heat

170
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,302
cramps are caused by a loss of:
A: water; B: sugar..."

171
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,013
>> "Number C, salt,
number D, protein."

172
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,517
The answer is C.
Question number four:

173
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,978
>> KEITH: "Australia's famous
for its scary snakes.

174
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,314
Of the ten most venomous snakes
in the outback...

175
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,818
>> How many live in Australia?"
Oh, my God.

176
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,947
A: three, B: six, C: nine,
D: ten."

177
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,992
I have no idea.
A?

178
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,162
Number five: "If you are one
mile from a lightning strike...

179
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,955
>> COLBY: "Approximately how
long would it take to you hear

180
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,000
the thunder?
A: one second, B: three

181
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:36,213
seconds, C: five seconds,
D: seven seconds."

182
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,299
>> This sounds like it's
backward to me.

183
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,510
I'm going to say D: seven
seconds.

184
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,681
>> JEFF: Okay, ready for
the results?

185
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,891
First question: "In the southern
hemisphere, the sun rises in

186
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:52,688
which direction?"
Correct answer was C: East.

187
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,856
Second question: "The emu is
the largest bird on the world."

188
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,318
False.
Ostrich.

189
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,028
Third question: "Heat cramps are
caused by a loss of...

190
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:04,200
C: Salt."
>> TINA: Oh, gosh.

191
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,328
>> JEFF: Fourth question:
"Australia is famous for its

192
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,372
scary snakes.
Of the ten most venomous snakes

193
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,001
in the outback--" key word--
"...how many live in Australia?"

194
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,837
Obviously, all ten.
Last question:

195
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,215
>> ELISABEITH: Oh, my gosh.
>> TINA: Gosh.

196
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,217
>> JEFF: "If you are one mile
from a lightning strike,

197
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,845
approximately how long would it
take you to hear the thunder?"

198
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,055
It's a myth that it's one
second.

199
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,058
It is five seconds.
All right, before I announce the

200
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,936
winner, let's recap what you're
going to win.

201
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,232
30 minutes online with your
family, $500 shopping spree,

202
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,068
courtesy of Visa, and for the
rest of you, one final moment to

203
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,363
say good-bye.
Winning the reward with four

204
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:47,701
correct answers-- Tina.
>> RODGER: Okay!

205
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,871
Go for it!
>> JEFF: Congratulations, Tina.

206
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,082
>> TINA: It feels good to win
something, for heaven sakes!

207
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,877
>> JEFF: All right, Rodger, you
get one last good-bye.

208
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,255
>> RODGER: You will not believe
the things I have saw and done.

209
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:06,887
I love you guys.
I told you I was going to...

210
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,056
need those.
>> COLBY: She said, "I will

211
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,644
fatten you up when you get home.
We all love you and miss you,

212
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,439
and can hardly wait for you to
be home.

213
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,774
Keep smiling and continue the
adventure.

214
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,444
Love, your mom."
>> ELISABETH: "Elisabeth, sorry

215
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,072
we didn't come through..."
Don't be sorry.

216
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,783
"We love you and we're so proud
of you.

217
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,995
We pray for you every day.
Kisses and hugs."

218
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,968
>> KEITH: I can only think of
one important question that came

219
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,972
to me one night as a shooting
star shot across the sky at some

220
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,183
wee hours of the morning: will
you marry me, Peas?

221
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,145
>> COLBY: Oh, my gosh.
Hope you were expecting

222
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,189
something like this.
>> RODGER: You did it.

223
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:04,320
You did it.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh!

224
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,780
>> Oh, my God.
"Will you marry me, Peas?"

225
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:13,120
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

226
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,330
>> ELISABETH: Can you imagine
being on the other end of this,

227
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,457
though.
>> TINA: Would you type that

228
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,835
response again?
I'm not sure I read that right.

229
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,129
>> KEITH: "Yes!"
Yes!

230
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:28,135
Yes.
Yes!

231
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,512
"You caught me off guard.
I've missed you more than words

232
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,431
can say.
I'm sorry I missed the cues.

233
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,974
It has been a long week.
I love you and hope to see you

234
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,977
soon.
Yes!"

235
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,480
>> TINA: Congratulations, Keith.
>> ELISABETH: Whoo, whoo!

236
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:44,526
Wow!
>> JEFF: All right, Tina.

237
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,656
The throne is yours.
>> TINA: Whenever I got on the

238
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,701
computer, I could not type fast
enough.

239
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,203
I said, "We won.
Of all the things that I wanted

240
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,207
to win, this was it.
I wanted to talk to you all so

241
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:04,922
much."
I got a major rush from getting

242
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,841
to go talk to my family.
And I thought that's enough to

243
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,844
carry me through another eight
days, easy.

244
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,389
I love and miss you all more
than you will ever know, and I

245
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,226
will never ever go away again
for this long.

246
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,855
I thought, "Eight more days?
Got it beat, girl."

247
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,532
>> RODGER: Best day out here.
Rewards challenge, and we all

248
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,200
won, every one of us.
>> KEITH: Everybody won today.

249
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,329
>> RODGER: We all got to talk to
our families back home.

250
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,252
>> COLBY: I mean, even in the
rain... it's finally soaked

251
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,879
through my shorts and my boots.
My feet are soaking wet, and I'm

252
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,133
still... I have a grin on
my face.

253
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:53,345
>> TINA: After I won my reward,
the main emotion was sheer joy.

254
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,312
>> ELISABETH: Look at this, a
little recreation going on.

255
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:07,860
>> COLBY: Nice!
>> TINA: I mean my mouth hurt

256
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,404
from just smiling the whole time
I was typing.

257
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,241
Just the few words that we got
to exchange between one another,

258
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:26,295
it was just sheer joy.
>> COLBY: Hey, Tina, Keith's

259
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,965
going to say grace.
>> KEITH: Dear God, thank you

260
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,260
for today.
It was an incredible day.

261
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:37,306
On a personal note, thank you
for the "yes" from my

262
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:42,478
sweetheart, Katrin.
And keep sending those prayers

263
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,314
back home for loved ones to
know that we miss them.

264
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,982
Keep them safe and continue to
keep us safe in our last few

265
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,819
days.
And we really thank you for this

266
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,196
opportunity and the experience
we've had in the outback.

267
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,324
Amen.
>> ALL: Amen.

268
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,161
>> COLBY: I think it was
apparent to everyone here that

269
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,163
today, at least for a day,
strategy did not enter in our

270
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,458
heads.
And that probably won't be the

271
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,169
case tomorrow.
But today, we didn't care about

272
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,006
winning a million bucks.
>> RODGER: It's going to be a

273
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,300
cold, cold night tonight.
>> TINA: Colby, you're the

274
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,179
candle blower outer.
Good night, everybody.

275
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,516
>> KEITH: Good night.
See you in the morning.

276
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,852
>> COLBY: Lights are out.
Keith, are you ready?

277
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,397
>> KEITH: Yes, sir.
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

278
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,225
>> KEITH: Rodger and I are
usually up the first time, you

279
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,435
know, before anybody.
We had a bad night of rain, so

280
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,898
anytime we have rain, we more
than likely lose our fire.

281
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,442
Starting a fire in the morning
is really very, very difficult.

282
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,909
We were out just doing our
morning bathroom break, and I

283
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,078
looked off to the horizon.
I said, "What is that smoke over

284
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:34,464
there?"
We found an actual piece of tree

285
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:39,553
that was smoldering from a
forest fire that was probably

286
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,265
two weeks old.
God's giving us a present this

287
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,977
morning on this cold, wet
morning.

288
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,317
That was a huge find for us.
It was the basis behind a great

289
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,403
fire.
>> RODGER: Do you believe that?

290
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,449
I literally cannot believe that.
>> KEITH: You can see how a

291
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,912
caveman learned about fire and
captured it, picked it up,

292
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,246
brought it back to where he was
at.

293
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,624
>> RODGER: And that's how they
started having weenie roasts.

294
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:18,675
>> KEITH: That was it.
>> TINA: Looking at the river,

295
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,639
>> KEITH: That was it.
>> TINA: Looking at the river,

296
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,933
it's running through our old
camp.

297
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:33,315
That is truly amazing.
>> COLBY: Wow.

298
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,860
From a material standpoint,
we've lost a lot.

299
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,489
I mean, we have our rice, and
now that we know we have food,

300
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,366
we rationed the rice for the
amount of days that we have

301
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,661
left.
>> ELISABETH: How much do we

302
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,704
have left?
>> RODGER: Two bags of brown

303
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,959
rice and a bag of white rice.
>> COLBY: Keith is cooking way

304
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,836
too much rice at every meal.
All you've got to do is just

305
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,130
make smaller servings and he
just... he can't get it through

306
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:02,552
his head.
>> KEITH: This is where the game

307
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,889
is really on right now.
My intention is that I'll be

308
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:10,185
here with Colby and Tina in the
last three.

309
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,064
At this stage of the game, it's
natural that political

310
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,526
campaigning is going on,
especially with these last few

311
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,570
individuals, because they're
your jury.

312
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,658
I'm doing a lot more of the
cooking now, now it's more one-

313
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:29,705
on-one dynamic, it's important
to be able to do things that the

314
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,541
other members of the group see
as a value.

315
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,378
Let me try something on this--
a little experiment here.

316
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,880
>> ELISABETH: Keith just said,
"I'm going to do a little

317
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,091
experiment with the brown rice
and white rice."

318
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,592
I mean, our portions were huge.
And he said, "You know, I'm used

319
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,886
to doing this sort of thing.
I can I assess how much we

320
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,764
have."
I think he just feels awfully

321
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,559
comfortable with the fact that
he's going to be one of the

322
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,395
final three or two, and he knows
the portion sizes will be bigger

323
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,189
then.
>> COLBY: Isn't that rice

324
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,275
cooked?
>> KEITH: Just cooked a little

325
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,402
bit of it.
It's okay, I blended it in with

326
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,946
the white.
The brown rice cooks up and

327
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,407
expands so much more; gives you
more volume.

328
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,452
>> COLBY: Keith, you said the
exact opposite five days ago.

329
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,745
You said the brown rice yields
less.

330
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,705
>> KEITH: No, I said you have to
use more water.

331
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,290
>> COLBY: No, you said it yields
less.

332
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,249
You said it three times in a
row.

333
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,542
>> KEITH: I said, if you don't
use more water.

334
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,712
>> COLBY: Put half a cup ration.
We decided on that and we have

335
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,713
not stuck to it in the last
four meals.

336
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,758
>> KEITH: Colby...
>> COLBY: I'm not going to do

337
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,759
this ration thing again, where
we run out of rice, Keith.

338
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,802
>> KEITH: We're fine.
>> COLBY: We were... we're

339
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,762
eating fine.
>> KEITH: Okay, we will be

340
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,097
fine.
I'll check it again, but I'm

341
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,725
sure we're more than fine.
>> ELISABETH: Check it right

342
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,394
after we eat.
>> KEITH: Yeah, I actually

343
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,729
checked it before we ate,
actually.

344
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,273
The rice issue today was the
first time I've seen Colby blow

345
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,485
up-- and it got me legitimately
concerned, especially when

346
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,446
Elisabeth was right there,
chiming in.

347
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,531
I thought there's something
going on here and I'm really in

348
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,118
a very vulnerable situation.
>> COLBY: We had 14 days worth

349
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,620
of rice with 12 days left, and
we're now breaking even.

350
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,289
>> ELISABETH: ...with the brown
rice, which doesn't even equal

351
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,624
the white.
>> KEITH: No, it does equal.

352
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,626
>> COLBY: No, it doesn't, Keith.
You're arguing yourself is what

353
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:01,922
you're doing because you said
two times in a span of five

354
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,465
minutes that brown rice does not
yield the same amount as white

355
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,801
rice.
>> KEITH: I said you have to use

356
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,969
more water to cook with.
>> COLBY: No, you didn't.

357
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,472
He's a fool.
The guy's a bozo, and I'm just

358
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,641
tired of it.
I'm tired of dealing with him.

359
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,311
I don't take anything that Keith
does for face value.

360
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,563
I think there's an ulterior
motive to everything he says and

361
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,109
everything he does, whether it's
cooking rice or proposing to his

362
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,735
girlfriend on-line.
I don't like the way he's

363
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,488
playing the game.
I think he's trying way too

364
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,657
hard because he can't make it on
just being who he is.

365
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,493
My game with Keith is done.
It's over.

366
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,497
>> KEITH: The rice cakes worked
beautifully.

367
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,346
>> COLBY: As far as what's
wearing on me the most: time.

368
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,181
The long days.
That's the only thing getting to

369
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,683
me, nothing else.
And if it weren't for the long

370
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,561
days, Keith wouldn't even get to
me.

371
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,354
I mean, I wouldn't be as
volatile as I am if it wasn't

372
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:07,696
for the boredom.
>> KEITH: Not unusual to sit and

373
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,241
look at the fire for an hour and
just stare at the fire and the

374
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:20,375
flames.
>> COLBY: Your fire becomes

375
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,336
what's been referred to as the
"outback television."

376
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,671
I mean, and that's what it is.
That's your entertainment.

377
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:28,091
You look and see how long an
ember can burn or how long it

378
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,551
takes a log to burn in half to
where it collapses.

379
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:39,060
It's just one of those things.
You color in a coloring book or

380
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,396
you play a few games of
backgammon.

381
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,732
Or you get into a conversation
with someone that you forgot you

382
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,735
had three days ago.
>> TINA: Make, like, red

383
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,780
cardboard paper and then I put
the white doilies in the center.

384
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,992
In my kitchen, in my dining
room, we have hearts.

385
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,744
You just have to walk through
them all throughout the house.

386
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,372
>> COLBY: Cold, hunger, wet--
none of that can compare to the

387
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,541
boredom.
It doesn't even fit in the same

388
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,879
category, as far as I'm
concerned.

389
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,423
>> RODGER: I literally cannot
stand, like, to go up there and

390
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,758
just lay around in that hut for
three or four hours, just drives

391
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,886
me crazy.
I said I got to get up and get

392
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,638
out of here.
I said I can't stay in this hut

393
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:19,601
laying around.
(<i> groans</i> )

394
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,605
>> COLBY: Rodger's always
chipped in more than he's had to

395
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,899
with the tribe, whether it be
fishing or boiling water.

396
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,944
He's always up to do stuff.
Being the oldest guy still here,

397
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,071
he's got more energy than any of
us do, you know, and I think it

398
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,740
comes from his heart.
>> RODGER: Out by the bathroom,

399
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,952
I found some more bark.
>> COLBY: Because we're not

400
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,954
playing for ourselves now,
we're playing for those who are

401
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,499
deserving to be here.
Rodger and Elisabeth and Tina

402
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,252
are all three deserving to be in
the final three.

403
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,129
As far as Keith goes, there's
not anything outstanding or

404
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,300
phenomenal that he's done that
has kept him in the game.

405
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,636
>> KEITH: Immunity plays a huge
part in this because immunity

406
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,638
could mean anyone can be along
farther in the game.

407
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,266
And at this point, anybody could
win.

408
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:05,855
>> RODGER: Up through here
somewhere, the nearest path.

409
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:12,112
Look at that.
Five lanterns.

410
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,657
And a log.
Want to take it back up there

411
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,035
before we open it?
>> COLBY: Yeah, let's do that.

412
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,666
There's an old lock and the
message reads like this: "Many

413
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,836
of the first settlers came as
prisoners here.

414
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,964
They'd escape into the outback,
no water, no food, no beer.

415
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,425
Your next challenge is a jail
break.

416
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,344
These lamps will light your way.
And if you listen carefully, in

417
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,680
the final four you'll stay."
I think it'll be fun.

418
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,307
It'll be interesting.
>> KEITH: This will be a blast.

419
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:50,358
>> COLBY: Yeah.
>> JEFF: Hey, guys.

420
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:56,197
>> COLBY: Yeah.
>> JEFF: Hey, guys.

421
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,741
>> ELISABETH: Hi, Jeff.
>> JEFF: I'll start by taking

422
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,077
the immunity necklace, since
you're shackled.

423
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,164
Immunity back up for grabs
tonight.

424
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,042
Now, the reason you're shackled:
the reason is because the first

425
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,379
settlers here in the outback
were themselves prisoners.

426
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,548
In a minute, I'm going to tell
you a story about these

427
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,884
prisoners, and when I'm
finished, you're going to use

428
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:20,013
the information in that story to
free yourself.

429
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,223
You're going to make your way
through this abandoned cattle

430
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,892
station where there are eight
different questions based on the

431
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,562
story.
Each correct answer to a

432
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,980
question gives you a key, and
that key will open up any one of

433
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,359
your five locks.
However, if you answer the

434
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,903
question wrong, you won't be
able to open the lock, and you

435
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,573
must move on to another one of
the eight stations.

436
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,076
You continue making your way
through the stations till you've

437
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,537
unlocked all five shackles.
The first person back here

438
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,582
completely freed carrying their
open shackles and their locks

439
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,127
wins immunity.
Okay, here's the story: the

440
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,713
first settlers were prisoners
brought over here from Great

441
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,466
Britain.
Now, occasionally, a prisoner

442
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,386
tried to escape, but the only
place they had to go was into an

443
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:03,598
early grave because these
escapees, known as bolters,

444
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:07,977
lacked one basic thing-- they
lacked basic survival skills.

445
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,772
Sun was their number one enemy.
Temperatures can reach upwards

446
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,983
of 110 degrees.
You can live for 30 days without

447
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,403
food.
Dehydration will kill you in

448
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,948
three days.
Prisoners tried to fight this by

449
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,951
taking off their clothes, which
exacerbated the dehydration

450
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,496
process.
And, in spite of how arid it is

451
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,164
out here, a lot of sources of
water, if you know where to

452
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,792
look.
Same with food.

453
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,086
You've tasted some of the food
from the outback.

454
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,257
Mangrove worms, even spiny leaf
insects, which are a better

455
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,300
source of protein than the
bigger lizards.

456
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,137
You get tired of bugs and
reptiles, bats will lead you to

457
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,265
large fruit that is colorless
but edible.

458
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:49,102
Birds will lead you to fruit
that is pretty but inedible.

459
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:53,148
Their sense of geography was so
skewed that they thought China

460
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,858
and India were just around the
corner, thinking China was only

461
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:59,446
150 miles from Australia.
Had they known some basic

462
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,365
skills, they could have found
their way.

463
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,493
For example, when visible during
the summer months, the Seven

464
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,163
Sisters constellation shows you
which way is south.

465
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,708
So the conditions out here were
very tough, but they weren't

466
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,669
insurmountable.
Aboriginals have lived out here

467
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:18,965
since 38,000 BC, which proves
that people can and do learn to

468
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,384
survive.
Now we're going to see what you

469
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,886
guys have learned.
Let's play.

470
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:28,016
Survivors, ready?
For immunity, go!

471
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,854
>> TINA: The lock is killing my
shin.

472
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,982
>> COLBY: "According to
prisoner's flawed geography,

473
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:45,074
what country was just 150 miles
from Australia?"

474
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,202
>> KEITH: "How long have
Aboriginal people been living in

475
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:54,250
Australia?"
40,000 years.

476
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,711
>> RODGER: "In which season is
the Seven Sisters constellation

477
00:29:56,794 --> 00:30:01,883
not visible?"
Summer.

478
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:06,513
Dad gummit.
>> TINA: Okay.

479
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,848
"To avoid dehydration from
the blazing sun, it's better

480
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,933
to...?"
"Remove clothing, wear

481
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,101
clothing."
Okay...

482
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,396
Okay.
Come on.

483
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,068
Get out.
>> ELISABETH: "What was the

484
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,196
slang for an escaped prisoner?"
Stepper.

485
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:29,953
Oh, no, that's wrong.
>> COLBY: "When searching for

486
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:36,918
fruit, it's best to follow
the..."

487
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,420
>> RODGER: "Pound for pound,
which is a better source of

488
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,589
protein?
Insect or lizard?"

489
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,092
Insect or lizard?
Insect or lizard?

490
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:50,598
I'm going to go with lizard.
(<i> sighs</i> )

491
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,268
>> TINA: "Death by dehydration
occurs how many times faster

492
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:58,273
than death by starvation?"
Ooh...

493
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:04,737
>> ELISABETH: Come on.
I guess not.

494
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,448
>> KEITH: Come on, come on, come
on, come on.

495
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,285
>> RODGER: "Death by dehydration
occurs how many times faster

496
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,996
than death by starvation?"
Five times.

497
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,291
I thought that was the wrong
answer.

498
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,460
>> ELISABETH: "What country was
just..."

499
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:24,424
>> COLBY: "To avoid dehydration
from the blazing sun..."

500
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:28,845
>> RODGER: 20,000 years.
>> ELISABETH: "To avoid

501
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,471
dehydration from the blazing
sun..."

502
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:36,144
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
>> KEITH: "How many times...?"

503
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:50,700
Ten times.
Come on.

504
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,327
"When searching for
fruit..."

505
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,248
Bats.
>> TINA: Is that not right?

506
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,334
Guess it's not right.
>> KEITH: Oh, yes, come on,

507
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,920
it should work.
I need this.

508
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,307
>> JEFF: Got them all?
>> KEITH: I don't know, I don't

509
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,809
know.
One, two, three.

510
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,394
>> JEFF: Keith, that's just
four.

511
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,188
Got to have all five to win,
bud.

512
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,315
>> KEITH: Shoot, where's my one
lock at?

513
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,116
>> JEFF: Got 'em?
Let me see them.

514
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,037
>> KEITH: Damn it.
>> COLBY: Hands and ankles.

515
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,206
That's it.
>> JEFF: Immunity.

516
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,668
>> COLBY: Sweet, baby!
>> JEFF: Got immunity: Colby.

517
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,712
>> KEITH: Damn!
You beat me!

518
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,089
>> COLBY: What'd you forget?
>> KEITH: My lock, I lost a lock

519
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,091
running with it.
Good job.

520
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,260
Good job.
>> JEFF: Let me present this to

521
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,806
you again.
How many times in a row have you

522
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,224
had immunity?
>> COLBY: Three times.

523
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,059
>> JEFF: Three times, man.
You are tough.

524
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,185
>> COLBY: Thank you very much.
>> JEFF: You're safe tomorrow

525
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,729
night.
You four are vulnerable.

526
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,940
I know you're a tight group.
Part of the game.

527
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,400
Head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow night at

528
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:15,493
tribal council.
>> RODGER: I don't know what's

529
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:38,766
tribal council.
>> RODGER: I don't know what's

530
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,435
going to happen at tonight's
tribal council.

531
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,271
I got the impression that it
would probably be myself and

532
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,274
Elisabeth, not necessarily in
that order, would be the next

533
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,111
two to be voted off.
Well, Tina mentioned which one

534
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:54,741
I felt needed the money the
worst: myself or Elisabeth.

535
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:59,120
I said I think Elisabeth
probably does because of, uh,

536
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,915
Elisabeth's background and her
mother being sick and what have

537
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,293
you.
And I just decided that I would

538
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,963
take the out first for
Elisabeth.

539
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,340
I was the chief executive
officer in a bank for 12 years,

540
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,094
so, you know...
>> TINA: That makes me feel real

541
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,764
good to hear.
>> RODGER: Yeah.

542
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,600
So Elisabeth's a nice young
lady.

543
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,977
I think about as much of her as
I do a lot of members of my

544
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,479
family.
I really do.

545
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,314
>> TINA: I do, too.
>> RODGER: Yeah, an awful sweet

546
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,317
girl.
When somebody's got medical

547
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,945
bills-- here she comes.
I really wouldn't want Elisabeth

548
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,324
to know that I had done that.
But Elisabeth and myself have

549
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:41,162
become very close, and I've kind
of watched out for her.

550
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,332
And that's basically it, really.
Basically the reason.

551
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,125
I'll share my seat there with
you.

552
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,710
I'm just sitting there, we're
just sitting there yacking and

553
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,213
I'm so rude.
>> ELISABETH: You are, Rodger.

554
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,841
That's what I think of you,
rude.

555
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,427
>> KEITH: Rodger just wanted it
to be known that when it comes

556
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,347
to picking Elisabeth or himself
to go first, he wanted to go

557
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,975
first.
But you don't know what's really

558
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,185
going to happen.
I could be voted off tonight and

559
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:10,525
totally blindsided.
>> ELISABETH: Tribal council is

560
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,528
more up in the air than I would
have thought tonight.

561
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,406
Colby supposedly was voting for
Rodger, and I don't know if

562
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,661
Keith has driven him crazy
enough that he'll vote for

563
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,871
Keith.
>> TINA: Everybody have their

564
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,707
bag?
>> COLBY: The biggest struggle I

565
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,503
deal with in the final few
tribal councils is whether I

566
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:35,007
want to sit beside someone who
almost guarantees me the million

567
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,760
bucks or whether I want to sit
beside someone who, if I don't

568
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,387
win the million bucks, I'll
still feel good about that other

569
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,098
person winning.
I don't even have my answer to

570
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,267
that.
I did yesterday, but it changed

571
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,936
this morning and it'll change
again tonight.

572
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,885
>> JEFF: We'll bring in the jury
now.

573
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,439
I'll once again remind you not
to address the jury.

574
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,735
As we wind down to six days
left, certainly the information

575
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,486
they gather at tribal councils
becomes increasingly

576
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,241
significant.
Keith, how big of an impact does

577
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,494
daily life have at this point?
You wake up in the morning with

578
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,122
one idea of who you're going to
vote out tonight.

579
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,291
By the time you get here, it's
completely different.

580
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,794
Is that plausible, possible?
>> KEITH: You know, you play a

581
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,298
lot of mind games with yourself.
I mean, you are your own worst

582
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,968
player at this stage of the game
because you're constantly

583
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,638
second-guessing your thought
process and, you know, you're

584
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,973
confident here and then you're
not confident there, and...

585
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:11,020
This game, as I keep saying,
"expect the unexpected"

586
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,481
because... it's where it is
right now.

587
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:17,193
>> JEFF: Is there a sense of
paranoia that takes over?

588
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,320
You see two people huddled in
the corner, you think, "I know

589
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,529
they're talking about me,
they're going to vote me out

590
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,614
tonight."
Is that starting to happen?

591
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,532
>> TINA: Absolutely.
Whenever there's this few people

592
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:27,995
left, and you think, "This is
closer than I thought and I

593
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,040
could make it, you know?
I've only got six days left."

594
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,918
And then you see some people
whispering and you're like, "Oh,

595
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,505
my gosh, I could go tonight."
You do.

596
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,508
You start getting nervous and
paranoid and then your whole

597
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,678
day's blown, you know, because
you don't know what's going to

598
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,554
happen.
>> JEFF: 36 days you guys have

599
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,183
spent together.
Some relationships have formed,

600
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,311
even ones I can see from the
outside.

601
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,814
Elisabeth, tell me about the
relationship with Rodger,

602
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,524
because you guys seem to have
really connected.

603
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:02,321
>> ELISABETH: Rodger is... I
call him my "outback daddy."

604
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:06,534
He just really is.
And from the moment I saw him, I

605
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,663
knew that there was something
special.

606
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:15,543
We've become friends.
I feel safe with Rodger around,

607
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,714
and Rodger's my man.
I love him.

608
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,507
>> JEFF: Rodger, how's it feel
to have somebody say such kind

609
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,677
words about you?
>> RODGER: Well, I'm very, very

610
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,387
flattered.
But I could very easily turn the

611
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:32,768
tables back on Elisabeth.
She's a fine young lady.

612
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:38,441
Character-wise, morals-wise and
she's tops in my book.

613
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,235
>> JEFF: Keith, when you look at
Colby with that immunity

614
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:45,406
necklace, knowing if you hadn't
dropped one of your locks, you'd

615
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,657
be wearing it tonight, what goes
through your mind?

616
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,702
Do you care at all?
>> KEITH: You know, of course I

617
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,580
wish I had it around my neck,
but that's the way the cookie

618
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,166
crumbles.
That was the way the game was

619
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,753
played, and it was all fair, and
I dropped the lock, and it was

620
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,715
my faux pas, and that's just the
way it goes, part of the game.

621
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,426
What are you going to do?
Can't cry over spilled milk.

622
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:11,390
>> JEFF: All right, guys.
11 torches behind me, five left.

623
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,600
Another torch is going to join
that tonight.

624
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,270
Let's vote.
Elisabeth, you're up.

625
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,949
>> ELISABETH: This is a great
group, but, Keith, I think that

626
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,828
you've been a little
overconfident and cocky about

627
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,290
how you're going to be here till
the very end.

628
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,659
>> KEITH: Old buddy, I look
forward to that home-cooked meal

629
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:16,539
in Kentucky.
And if it's my time to go, I

630
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,291
can't wait to see you on the
outside.

631
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,841
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

632
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,071
Once the votes are tallied, the
decision is final.

633
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,531
The person voted out of the
tribe will be asked to leave the

634
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:57,037
tribal council area immediately.
First vote...

635
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:11,552
Keith.
Rodger.

00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,521
and the outback has taken its

>> RODGER: I was the oldest

652

person getting off the plane, 53
years old.

653
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,629
I've been out here 36 days and
just had six more to go.

654
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:14,008
I could've done without food
for those next six days, if I'd

655
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,676
had to, to stayed out here.
I wish them all the luck and I

656

especially wish the best of luck
to Elisabeth.

657
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,058
I hope she goes all the way.
Thank you.
