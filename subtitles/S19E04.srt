<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,129
Here in Samoa, the purple tribe,

4
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,214
Galu, has been on a roll...

5
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,007
Galu wins!

6
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,092
...winning all three immunity

7
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,051
challenges.

8
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,012
At camp, most of the tribe

9
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,931
kicked back and relaxed, while

10
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,057
Shambo did most of the work.

11
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,475
>> I'm not doing the warm and

12
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,560
fuzzy.

13
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,519
I'm doing the Rambo-Shambo

14
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,520
provider role out here.

15
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,563
>> PROBST: In a twist, Shambo

16
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,897
was sent to observe the other

17
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,857
tribe.

18
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,858
>> We call you McDreamy.

19
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,859
>> Pleasure.

20
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,860
>> PROBST: And she immediately

21
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,028
bonded with everyone.

22
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,322
At Foa Foa, Russell was a force

23
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,407
to be reckoned with.

24
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,616
>> I'm running this whole show

25
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,659
right now.

26
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,702
>> PROBST: He constantly

27
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,036
manipulated the others to

28
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,037
further his own ends.

29
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,080
>> I'm going to have them all

30
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,081
under control like zombies

31
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,082
walking around.

32
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,125
>> PROBST: As the yellow tribe

33
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,418
was preparing to go to their

34
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,419
third Tribal Council in a row...

35
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,420
>> He was...

36
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,129
>> If I was a girl, I would slap

37
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,297
you, is what I would do.

38
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,214
>> PROBST: ...Jaison got furious

39
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,257
at Ben because of his

40
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,263
racially-insensitive comments.

41
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,973
>> PROBST: Jaison wanted Ben

42
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,057
out, but Russell didn't agree.

43
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:58,641
>> Right now, I think I need

44
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,309
Ben.

45
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,893
>> PROBST: At Tribal Cou

46
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,729
Ben wouldn't back down.

47
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,772
>> She is from the ghetto, and

48
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,731
she's trashy.

49
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,690
That's ghetto trash.

50
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,691
That's not racial.

51
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,692
>> PROBST: So Jaison stood up to

52
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,693
him.

53
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,319
>> If what you're telling me is

54
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,196
that what you said had

55
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,072
absolutely no racial context,

56
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:13,823
then maybe you<i> are</i> ignorant.

57
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,324
>> PROBST: During the

58
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,242
confrontation, Russell realized

59
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,869
his best play was to vote off

60
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:18,912
Ben.

61
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,330
>> I didn't want to have to do

62
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,331
this, man.

63
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,457
>> PROBST: Ben became the fourth

64
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,500
member of Foa Foa to leave the

65
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,542
game.

66
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,044
Now the tribe is down in

67
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,837
numbers and morale.

68
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,838
16 are left.

69
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,509
Who will be voted out tonight?

70
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,232
>> Yeah.

71
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,233
>> What happened at Tribal

72
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,359
Council was me trying to let Ben

73
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,153
know how I felt.

74
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,947
I cannot handle people who use

75
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,365
terms and phrases that are meant

76
00:01:55,448 --> 00:02:01,830
to hurt on a very basic level.

77
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,831
>> Jaison, there's room here,

78
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,832
too.

79
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,833
>> Man!

80
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,084
I'm hungry, and I'm tired.

81
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,544
I came here to have an

82
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,838
adventure, but, frankly, I,

83
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,548
right now, believe that coming

84
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,842
here was the worst decision I've

85
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,011
made in my entire life.

86
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,480
>> It's draining, man.

87
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,315
It's not only physically tough.

88
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,358
It's mentally tough.

89
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,818
It messes with your mind, your

90
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,153
body and your soul.

91
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,321
Coming back from Tribal last

92
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,073
night, Jaison was really upset

93
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,491
with Ben.

94
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,909
You know, he took things very

95
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,411
personal.

96
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,370
I really think that if Ben would

97
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,539
have stayed, Jaison would have

98
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,665
quit the game.

99
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,500
Now, what kind of man is that?

100
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,214
>> Yeah, dude.

101
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,341
>> Yeah?

102
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,012
>> Now I'm willing to get rid of

103
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,306
Jaison, and whoever I want to be

104
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,474
gone is going to be gone.

105
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,309
I've got it all under my thumb

106
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,810
right now.

107
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,937
♪ ♪

108
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,931
>> I got back at Galu last

109
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,557
night, and I'm not happy,

110
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,351
because when I went over to

111
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,770
Foa Foa, there was a huge

112
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,563
appreciation for Shambo, huge

113
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,856
appreciation.

114
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,858
Their camp is amazing, you guys.

115
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,443
Fresh water, white sand beaches.

116
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,113
No coral, you can go barefoot.

117
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,031
Everybody over there loved me.

118
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,033
I feel ten times closer to

119
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,410
Foa Foa than I do Galu, because

120
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,787
Galu-- they just want to lay on

121
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,206
the beach and gossip.

122
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,791
So, I don't have no problem

123
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,209
going to Foa Foa, because I

124
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,669
already have a following there,

125
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,461
and if I can make it to the

126
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,797
merge, I know damn well I've got

127
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,009
their vote, so I'm way ahead.

128
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,892
>> Yas got a clue for the

129
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,893
immunity idol.

130
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,894
>> Okay.

131
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,895
>> You got a clue for the

132
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,896
immunity idol.

133
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,897
>> Absolutely.

134
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,898
>> Wherever the immunity idol

135
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,899
is on their beach, it's

136
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,900
probably on our beach.

137
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,985
Nobody really got to talk to

138
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,986
Shambo last night about the

139
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,195
second clue to the immunity

140
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,322
idol, right?

141
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,323
So I come up with this little

142
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,324
idea to find out all the

143
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,325
information I want to get from

144
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,326
her.

145
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,660
(Shambo sighs)

146
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,412
If I can find the immunity

147
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,788
idol, I can give it to you if

148
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,789
you're in danger.

149
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,790
>> Yup.

150
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,000
>> At least you'll have that.

151
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,501
I'm, like, 30 seconds away from

152
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,544
nailing all the information I

153
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,838
want to get from her, and here

154
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,256
comes John, and he stops, and,

155
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,883
like, "Hey, Shambo."

156
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,508
Like he has this brilliant idea.

157
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,551
>> You got a clue, and Yasmin

158
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,594
had a clue.

159
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,929
>> I got her clue and my clue.

160
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,556
>> What was Yasmin's clue?

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,017
>> Yasmin's clue was, "You'll

162
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,352
find what you seek in the bark."

163
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,479
And the second one is, "It's

164
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,439
low to the ground."

165
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,982
Those were the exact words.

166
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,608
If it comes down to jury trial,

167
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,484
you guys better give me the

168
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,610
vote for giving you honesty on

169
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,611
this question.

170
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,446
>> Well, listen, if um...

171
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,530
If we can...

172
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,240
>> And if you don't, bad on you.

173
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:06,616
Got to go.

174
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,576
I don't feel like I've hurt

175
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,036
myself in the game in any way,

176
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,120
shape, or form by sharing

177
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:11,537
knowledge with them.

178
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,540
That can do nothing but help me

179
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,625
going forward.

180
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,918
And-And maybe it won't.

181
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,294
Maybe it will hurt me, but

182
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:18,544
we'll see.

183
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,965
>> Tree mail.

184
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,133
>> Uh-oh.

185
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:24,759
>> And it says, "The chief must

186
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,719
choose two to join him on a

187
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,262
quest to go on a special mission

188
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:28,805
which could turn out for the

189
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,639
best.

190
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,640
And when your chief comes

191
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,641
home..."

192
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,518
>> Oh!

193
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,519
>> "...your tribe might have

194
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,520
more to eat..."

195
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:35,728
>> Oh!

196
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,646
>> "...but you won't know why

197
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,440
until the mission is complete."

198
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,441
>> Basically, they just want one

199
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:40,775
guy, one girl.

200
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,443
We just got some tree mail, and

201
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,945
it says that I need to choose

202
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,196
two people to go on a mission,

203
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,948
which may or may not lead to us

204
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,616
having a little bit more food.

205
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,867
Obviously, you want to bring

206
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,327
people that are strong in some

207
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,204
sort of challenge situation.

208
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,831
So I'll be taking Russell,

209
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,624
because he is good at

210
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,625
strategizing, and Natalie is

211
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,668
good with puzzles, things of

212
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,669
that nature.

213
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,753
So I thought it was perfect.

214
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,754
Everybody's comfortable with

215
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,755
this?

216
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,840
>> That's fine, yup.

217
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,841
>> Yup, yup.

218
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:12,390
>> Let's do this.

219
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,683
>> Have to choose two people to

220
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,435
go on a quest with me, so I took

221
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,979
Shambo and Dave because I need

222
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,398
some-some brains and some

223
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,733
firepower.

224
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:37,623
Here comes Foa Foa.

225
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,042
>> So we're just sitting there

226
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,836
looking at each other.

227
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,879
You know, we're waiting for

228
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,297
Jeff, 'cause at every challenge

229
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,756
so far, Jeff has always been

230
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,883
there.

231
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,052
So we're, like, what do we do?

232
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,053
>> So what's going on?

233
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,388
>> I don't know.

234
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,431
>> Let's lay an egg.

235
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:53,890
(indistinct chatter)

236
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,433
>> Oh, my word.

237
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,226
>> Oh, chickens.

238
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,227
>> Oh, my God.

239
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,270
>> Who knows what's in the

240
00:07:59,353 --> 00:07:59,729
other one.

241
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,606
>> Nah. It's probably rice and

242
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,648
beans.

243
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,483
>> Oh, if you catch the chicken,

244
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,568
you get the pirate chest full

245
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,569
of food.

246
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,570
Ha, ha.

247
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,571
>> Maybe so.

248
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,906
>> I don't think that's what it

249
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,907
is.

250
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,908
>> Some kind of swap?

251
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,909
>> I think so, too.

252
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,701
>> I wonder if we're just

253
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,204
supposed to jump, like just get

254
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,330
over there and start doing

255
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,708
stuff without even asking.

256
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,835
(clucking)

257
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,181
>> Wait.

258
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,182
>> A reward challenge.

259
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,266
"For today's challenge, you'll

260
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,559
be left on your own to battle

261
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,602
for reward inside this box... "

262
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,770
Suddenly, it was on.

263
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,812
The frenzy was on.

264
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,105
Shambo's grabbing chickens,

265
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,482
we're jumping into the treasure

266
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,608
box, and it's got all these

267
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,026
colored balls, and it's got some

268
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,110
instructions.

269
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,737
>> Oh, all right, Sham, the

270
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,780
reward cannot be opened and-and

271
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,781
shared between tribes...

272
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,823
Sham, put those chickens back

273
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,824
and come on back.

274
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,867
>> Hey, put the chicken back,

275
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,910
quick.

276
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,953
>> Take 'em back. Take' em back.

277
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,413
Take them chickens back.

278
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,665
>> Okay, so what is the deal?

279
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,624
>> Uh... "For today's challenge,

280
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,583
you will be left on your own to

281
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,584
battle for reward.

282
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,003
Inside this box are a flag and

283
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,004
three tribe-colored balls for

284
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,005
each player.

285
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,006
One player will place the flag

286
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,007
in the center of the beach.

287
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,550
One at a time, you will toss a

288
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,009
ball toward the flag.

289
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,928
The object is to land your ball

290
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,263
closest to the flag.

291
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:15,805
Once all the balls have been

292
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,015
thrown, the ball closest to the

293
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,016
flag wins."

294
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,017
>> Boccie ball.

295
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,018
>> It's like boccie ball.

296
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,019
>> It's boccie ball, horseshoes.

297
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,479
>> All right.

298
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:24,480
Oh, reward challenge.

299
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:25,481
Awesome!

300
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,482
It's basically like a game of

301
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:27,441
boccie ball.

302
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,234
The tribe that wins gets to

303
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,026
take these chickens home.

304
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,819
>> So, we'll start with the

305
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,611
chiefs, so you start first.

306
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:30,945
>> All right.

307
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,572
>> Yeah.

308
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,406
>> Then I'll start.

309
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,282
>> Chiefs first, ladies

310
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,283
second...

311
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,284
>> Chiefs first.

312
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,285
>> And the esteemed gentleman...

313
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,286
>> Yeah, that's fine.

314
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,287
>> All right, cheers.

315
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,288
>> All right.

316
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,289
>> All right, let's do this.

317
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:41,998
>> All right.

318
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,749
>> Let's go, Mick.

319
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,626
Oh, good shot, Mick.

320
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,086
>> Good job, Mick. Good job.

321
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,422
You got this one, chief.

322
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,551
>> That was a good one, too.

323
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:53,759
Ah!

324
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,760
>> Mm.

325
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,761
>> So close.

326
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,347
>> Wow.

327
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,348
>> Yes!

328
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,141
>> Oh, son of a...

329
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,142
>> Yes!

330
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,144
>> Oh, God.

331
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,353
>> Russell's ball knocks mine

332
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,688
closest, and I can taste the

333
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,233
chicken in my mouth.

334
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,234
>> Wow.

335
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,736
>> Good shot, Mick.

336
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,737
>> Oh!

337
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,821
>> Oh!

338
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,198
>> Stay out of his way now.

339
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,575
Make sure you don't hit it.

340
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,285
>> Mick had thrown those last

341
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,287
two balls so close to the stick.

342
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,871
My goal was to, like, not even

343
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,498
get close to him, because I

344
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,500
didn't want to mess anything up.

345
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,501
Oh, no.

346
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,502
Sorry, guys.

347
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,503
>> Nice.

348
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,504
>> Aah!

349
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,505
>> All right, you're up.

350
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,590
>> I'm going to knock him out

351
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,716
of there.

352
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,675
>> Get one in.

353
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,885
>> Mm.

354
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:41,766
>> Oop. Too strong.

355
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,353
>> Aim right for that stick.

356
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,355
>> Oh, my God, I'm a mess.

357
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,356
>> Try knocking his out.

358
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,357
>> That's what I'm going for.

359
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,358
>> Oh!

360
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,359
>> Oh!

361
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,360
>> Oh!

362
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,361
>> There we go.

363
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:53,944
>> Nice!

364
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,945
>> Nice hit.

365
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:55,946
(grunting)

366
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,697
>> Oh, Shannon Lee.

367
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,450
Lord have mercy.

368
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,077
>> We're panicking all over the

369
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,078
place.

370
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,120
Shambo was, like, no good.

371
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,205
>> Dang!

372
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,249
>> So now it's between Russell

373
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,459
from Foa Foa and Dave.

374
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,794
And each has three shots to win

375
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,045
this game.

376
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,088
>> All right, Russell, we need

377
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,965
you.

378
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,803
>> Good job, Russell.

379
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,181
>> All right, you're up, Dave.

380
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,769
Not bad, not bad.

381
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,107

574
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,082
about, since the first day,

575
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,291
about being the final two at the

576
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,168
end, so at this point, I'm kind

577
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,169

578
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,214

582
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,763
underestimate me, and I want

583
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,431
them to think that, hey, it's

584
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,766
really smart for them to take me

585
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,976
to the end because they can beat

586
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:04,560
me.

587
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,727
You know, use that to my

588
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,478
advantage.

591
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,650
Russell in the very end, 'cause

592
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,819
I would say a lot of other

593
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,862
people in the tribe have really

594
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,071

ruffle feathers, steer clear,

599
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,454

really bad, but at least I

666
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,445
produced an egg."

667
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,446
You didn't produce an egg.

668
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,447
The chicken laid an egg.

669
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,448
What did you do to produce the

670
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,783
egg, Shambo?

671
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,617
And nobody cares.

672
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,827
That's the worst part.

680
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,460
Hmm.

681
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,961
All right, I'll be back.

682
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,547
>> Bye.

00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,175
I am so sick of Yas doing

684
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,676
absolutely nothing.

685
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,719
She's, like, waiting around to

686
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,470
be taken care of like she's a

687
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,056
little princess, so she's kind

688
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:24,653
of frustrating and annoying.

689
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,030
I think the reason our tribe is

690
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,865
working so well is because we

691
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,574
are really focusing on bringing

692
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,952
our team as strong as possible

693
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,245

694
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,788
But Yas is here for herself.

695
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,622
She's not a team player.

696
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,499
She doesn't help out around

698
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,459
And say we do lose a challenge.

699
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,837
I think Yas would be the first

700
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,965

For today's challenge, you will

716
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,085
race across a net run carrying

717
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:22,669

When you reach the platform,

719
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,047
you must stack the blocks one

720
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,549
on top of the other.

721
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,134
Once you've completed the stack,

724

725
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,682
This will stack even higher.

727
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,561

949
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,268
Galu with their last three

950
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,853
blocks.

951
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,854
Kelly has them.

952
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,855
>> Easy, easy.

953
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,856
>> PROBST: Natalie with the last

954
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,857
block for Foa Foa.

955
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,983
>> Push up a little bit.

956
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,151
>> No, I can't reach it.

957
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,235
>> Hurry, you guys. They're...

958
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,236
>> PROBST: Kelly loses two

959
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,237
blocks.

960
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,238
>> Almost there.

961
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,239
>> No, no, no, no!

962
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,158
>> Natalie, you've got it...

963
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,201
>> PROBST: Natalie places it for

964
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,202
Foa Foa!

965
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,203
Do they have it?

966
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:48,828
(indistinct chatter)

967
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,997
>> PROBST: One, two, three,

968
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,333
four, five!

969
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,001
Foa Foa wins their first

970
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,002
immunity challenge!

971
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,754
(cheering and whooping)

972
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,423
>> Yes!

973
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,007
>> Everybody keep their head

974
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,843
held high, head held high.

975
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,012
>> PROBST: Foa Foa,

976
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,055
congratulations.

977
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,599
Who wants it?

978
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,893
Everybody wants it.

979
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,103
For the first time in this

980
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,439
game, Foa Foa will not be going

981
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:16,940
to Tribal Council.

982
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,982
Enjoy the night off.

983
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,859
Grab your stuff.

984
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,860
Head back to camp.

985
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,487
Congratulations.

986
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,488
(thunder rumbles)

987
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,864
Well, I don't know if Mother

988
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,699
Nature is sending you guys a

989
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,117
sign or not, but there's a big

990
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,410
cloud over your head right now.

991
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,453
Should be an interesting

992
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,412
afternoon figuring out who's

993
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,455
going home.

994
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,456
Grab your stuff.

995
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,583
I will see you at Tribal.

996
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,794
(thunder crackling)

997
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,546
>> I saw Monica basically

998
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,964
disappear at that challenge.

999
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,090
This is<i> Survivor.</i>

1000
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,802
This is about physical, mental

1001
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,136
toughness.

1002
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,012
And today, Monica just did not

1003
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:59,607
have it.

1004
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,900
>> All right, so, I'm going to

1005
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,860
try and get this fire started,

1006
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,696
and we will, uh, keep movin' and

1007
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,447
groovin' until it's time to do

1008
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,824
what we got to do.

1009
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,909
Today, we lost our first

1010
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,035
immunity challenge, and I just

1011
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,913
got pissed off.

1012
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,665
That there was no reason why we

1013
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,791
should have lost.

1014
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,835
We had the lead the whole time,

1015
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,170
and then I kind of saw one

1016
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,298
person kind of fall apart, and

1017
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,008
that was Monica.

1018
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,218
(sighs)

1019
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,014
>> In terms of the challenge,

1020
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,725
Monica screwed that up.

1021
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,519
There's no question in my mind.

1022
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,645
>> She was terrible.

1023
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,606
>> She was terrible.

1024
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,357
She's a young girl, hanging

1025
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,818
out, having a good time.

1026
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:44,944
It's like it's like Club Med or

1027
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,196
something.

1028
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,951
As much as I hate to do that.

1029
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,247
>> Yeah.

1030
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,630
>> What are we going to do about

1031
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:04,631
the vote tonight?

1032
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,632
>> I don't know.

1033
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,759
>> Well, I don't know.

1034
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,093
>> Well, I'd say that Sham's

1035
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,972
colossal screwups are kind of a

1036
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,057
shot to team morale.

1037
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,600
>> Are they?

1038
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,477
>> Well, I mean...

1039
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,562
>> They're nonstop.

1040
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,315
>> You know what I mean?

1041
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,316
>> I think she does the least

1042
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,317
out of everyone here.

1043
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,318
>> Yup, exactly.

1044
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,319
>> Is that where we're going--

1045
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,320
with Yas?

1046
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,321
>> I mean, that's...

1047
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,739
>> As far as I'm concerned, Yas

1048
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,907
goes.

1049
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,908
>> We are going to our first

1050
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,493
Tribal Council tonight.

1051
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,244
Some names are going about.

1052
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,871
For instance, Yas doesn't

1053
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:38,414
really do anything.

1054
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,083
She basically sits by the fire

1055
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,000
and kind of observes things.

1056
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,628
So that kind of gets annoying.

1057
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,171
So I think Yas might be going

1058
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,464
home tonight.

1059
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,424
But, hey, it is<i> Survivor.</i>

1060
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,760
Crazier things have happened.

1061
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,472
>> You want to vote Monica out?

1062
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,973
She took about 200% longer than

1063
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:56,516
anybody to run that rope.

1064
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,142
>> Me and John was across that

1065
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,143
rope first and fast.

1066
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,228
>> Right.

1067
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,437
>> So, that's why I'm saying I

1068
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,522
can't worry about it, because I

1069
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,523
don't want the negativity.

1070
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,524
>> Exactly.

1071
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,525
>> Whatever's going to happen is

1072
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,651
going to happen.

1073
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,694
>> See, that's how I am.

1074
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,778
>> I know I haven't came up

1075
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,904
short. I'm sorry.

1076
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:10,905
>> Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

1077
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:11,906
>> You know what I'm saying?

1078
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:12,949
And around this camp, I ain't

1079
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:13,950
stepping up to do nothing

1080
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,951
because you know what these

1081
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:15,952
people do-- they prey on you

1082
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:16,953
doing something wrong, like

1083
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,453
letting the chicken go.

1084
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,038
They prey on that.

1085
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:19,956
>> Yeah?

1086
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,540
>> See, so therefore, nobody

1087
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,208
will be preying on me.

1088
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,794
I've had my game face on since

1089
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,545
day one.

1090
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,963
I'm here to play.

1091
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,507
And I did just that.

1092
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,008
I've been running with the

1093
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,218
fellas and helping us win our

1094
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,011
challenges, and I'm not looking

1095
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,012
down on nobody.

1096
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,055
But, you know, Monica didn't

1097
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:36,431
help us win today.

1098
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,100
So if you want to penalize me

1099
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,686
for stepping up, then so be it.

1100
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,146
Vote me out, because my body

1101
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,274
could use a rest, damn it.

1102
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,241
>> Russ, to me, sounds dead set

1103
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,201
on Monica.

1104
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,494
>> I don't know.

1105
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,246
I mean, I like Monica.

1106
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,458
You know what I mean? Like...

1107
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,421
>> There's a ton of crazy talk

1108
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,047
about voting Yas tonight.

1109
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,466
True, she doesn't do a lot of

1110
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,967
work around here, but Yas is

1111
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,010
completely stronger in

1112
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,428
challenges than Monica.

1113
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,847
Unfortunately, people seem to be

1114
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,473
rallying behind Monica, and I

1115
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,725
don't know how that's gonna play

1116
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,225
out.

1117
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,560
>> If you decide to go away from

1118
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,103
Monica, then you're gonna vote

1119
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,605
against your leader.

1120
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,023
Which we could do, because we

1121
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,941
have numbers, but I don't want

1122
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,193
to be on Russ's bad side.

1123
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,279
>> I am not in the mood to mess

1124
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,406
with Russell.

1125
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,794
>> Really?

1126
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,377
>> I'm telling you, because...

1127
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,713
>> So these people who are gonna

1128
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,881
vote for Yas, they basically

1129
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,049
already have an alliance,

1130
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:53,966
basically.

1131
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,592
>> Well, I don't know if it's an

1132
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,344
alliance as much as it is, like,

1133
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,054
a decision that maybe they don't

1134
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:58,638
trust...

1135
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,847
>> Well, they don't trust me.

1136
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,306
You know what I mean?

1137
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,642
That's what it comes down to.

1138
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,351
>> Boss?

1139
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,478
>> All right...

1140
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,231
Yasmin, that's a vote that I

1141
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,149
absolutely disagree with.

1142
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,651
Every time there was a

1143
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,903
challenge, Yasmin kicked it out.

1144
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,447
Today Monica dragged her butt.

1145
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,206
And right now...

1146
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,958
That's it.

1147
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,543
I want the strongest tribe, and

1148
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,420
I'm the leader, so these people,

1149
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,296
they got to listen to me, or

1150
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,049
there's gonna be some serious

1151
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,426
ass-kicking.

a torch.

1155
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,697
Go ahead and grab a torch.

1156
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,823
Approach a flame.

1157
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,951
Dip it in and get fire.

1158
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,580
This is part of the ritual of

1159
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,247
Tribal Council, because in this

1160
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,417
game, fire represents your life.

1161
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,418
As long as you have fire, you're

1162
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,335
still in the game.

1163
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,378
When your fire's gone, so are

1164
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,005
you.

1165
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,214

Shambo, interesting afternoon

1170
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,471
knowing you had to come to

1171
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,181
Tribal tonight?

1172
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,600
>> Yeah, everybody was a little

1173
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,435
uneasy, and there was people

1174
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,645
going for walks on the beach,

1175
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,188
there was a little bit of

1176
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,441
whispering going on, and...

1177
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,233
it's not good.

1178
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,318
We don't want to be here.

1179
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,194
We're bummed, all of us.

life.

1182
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,740
Brett, do you think everybody's

1183
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,283
pulling equal share of the

1184
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,159
weight?

1185
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,994
>> Uh, there's definitely people

1186
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,245
that are pulling more weight

1187
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:46,829
than they should, and there's

1188
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:47,455
also other people, uh, Yasmin,

1189
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,248
that are, you know, maybe doing

1190
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,334
a little bit less work.

1191
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,335
>> PROBST: Yasmin, you're

1192
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,252
already rolling your eyes.

1193
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,795
>> I wasn't rolling my eyes, but

1194
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,338
if you want my opinion next,

1195
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,297
I'll be happy to give it.

1196
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,007
>> PROBST: Sure.

1197
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,175
>> Well, I find that a bit of a

1198
00:36:59,258 --> 00:36:59,800
surprise.

1199
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,260
As a matter of fact, anything

1200
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:01,844
somebody has asked me to do, I

1201
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,262
have did it.

1202
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,931
So I don't see how he figure I

1203
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:05,348
could be doing more.

1204
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,349
I felt like that's the

1205
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,851
conversation him and I could've

1206
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:09,477
had beforehand, and I would've

1207
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,311
stepped it up.

1208
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,938
Because I have not shied away

1209
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:12,730
from any work.

1210
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,065
And maybe I don't belong in a

1211
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,316
jungle because I have on heels,

1212
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,692
but I wanted to dress up for

1213
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,818
you, Jeff, so I thought, you

1214
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,028
know, that I'd look a little,

1215
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,237
you know, nice or whatever,

1216
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:20,780
so...

1217
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,447
>> PROBST: Mission accomplished.

1218
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,281
>> Thank you.

1219
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,491
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1220
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,367
challenges.

1221
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,619
Russell, how important are

1222
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,329
challenges in this game right

1223
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:28,496
now?

1224
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,873
>> I mean, for me, challenges

1225
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,166
are your base.

1226
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,376
'Cause if the base isn't there,

1227
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,502
everything topples.

1228
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,671
So get the challenges done, the

1229
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,756
rest falls into place.

1230
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,757
>> PROBST: Yasmin, you're

1231
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,175
shaking your head in agreement.

1232
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:41,676
>> I'm very competitive at

1233
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,718
heart.

1234
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,220
I just always like to step up,

1235
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,346
'cause, damn it, I like to

1236
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,222
compete.

1237
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,473
So I totally agree with Russell,

1238
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,392
101%.

1239
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,601
>> PROBST: So based on what you

1240
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,144
said, who could've given more at

1241
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:52,520
today's challenge?

1242
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,313
>> Today, Monica struggled.

1243
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,523
That's just the way that I see

1244
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,358
it.

1245
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,651
>> PROBST: Monica, what do you

1246
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,069
do when you hear your name as

1247
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,362
somebody who might have blown

1248
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,446
the challenge that put you here?

1249
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,447
>> It sucks.

1250
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,448
I mean, especially for me, I

1251
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,742
think I did a great job at the

1252
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,868
challenge today.

1253
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,995
I mean, getting on the rope

1254
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:09,620
originally, I had to kind of get

1255
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,664
my bearings, but once I got past

1256
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,331
that, I think I really came back

1257
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,751
to my normal self.

1258
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,461
>> PROBST: So, Dave, you can go

1259
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,796
camp life, you can go

1260
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,172
challenges, or you can go

1261
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,966
individual strategy.

1262
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:22,591
The problem with that is if you

1263
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,552
start making big moves too

1264
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,095
soon, you will destroy your

1265
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:26,721
tribe and it's only a matter of

1266
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,514
time before you're gone.

1267
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,141
>> Uh, I think, ultimately,

1268
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,475
what's good for the tribe is

1269
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,393
good for me, and so that's what

1270
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,604
I'm basing my vote on.

1271
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,939
>> PROBST: Laura, do you agree

1272
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:37,481
with that?

1273
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,983
>> Number one for me is who's

1274
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,317
really helping around the camp

1275
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,237
the most.

1276
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,113
>> PROBST: All right, well, it

1277
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,281
sounds like there are a couple

1278
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,116
of different philosophies about

1279
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,200
how the vote should go tonight.

1280
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,827
Let's see which one wins out.

1281
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,411
It is time to vote.

1282
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,538
Erik, you're up.

1283
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,891
>> (whispering): I don't feel

1284
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,975
like you have carried your

1285
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,477
weight around camp, despite what

1286
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,604
you say.

1287
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,420
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1288
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,547
votes.

1289
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:55,643
Once the votes are read, the

1290
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,477
decision is final.

1291
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,520
The person voted out will be

1292
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,480
asked to leave the Tribal

1293
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,065
Council area immediately.

1294
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,402
I'll read the votes.

1295
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,113
First vote...

1296
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,240
Yasmin.

1297
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,284
Yasmin.

1298
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,411
Two votes Yasmin.

1299
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,998
Monica.

1300
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,125
That's two votes Yasmin, one

1301
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,461
vote Monica.

1302
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:22,670
Monica.

1303
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,755
Two votes Monica.

1304
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,802
Yas.

1305
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,178
That's three votes Yasmin, two

1306
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,305
votes Monica.

1307
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,642
Yasmin.

1308
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,018
That's four votes Yasmin, two

1309
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,146
votes Monica.

1310
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,649
>> That's five votes Yasmin, two

1311
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,776
votes Monica.

1312
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,614
>> Fourth person voted out of

1313
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,658
<i>Survivor: Samoa,</i> Yasmin.

1314
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,076
That's six votes; that's enough.

1315
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,163
You need to bring me your torch.

1316
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,715
Yasmin, the tribe has spoken.
