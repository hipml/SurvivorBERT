10

>> And when we're in the merge

11
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,311
together, we keep an eye out for

12
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,396
each other, and that's going to

13
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,355
be the difference between our

14
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,358

Keep it going, dog.

19
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,493
>> Throw it.

20
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,911
>> Stefannie had about three

21
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,247
swigs, and she's delirious.

22
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,790

away from our island.

26
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:51,760
>> I know.

27
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,343
I don't know what to do about

28
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,471
it.

29
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,680
>> What is that?

30
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,598
>> I hope that's not them

31
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,557
flipped over.

32
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,227

>> PROBST: You'll see highlights

34
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,689
from the first 18 days of this

35
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,900
adventure.

36
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:07,525
>> Ah!

37
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,735
>> No!

38
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,362
>> Ah, stop!

39
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,282
I am so sorry.

40
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,075
>> I came here to play the game.

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,951
That's my dream.

42
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:17,952
My prize isn't even the million

43
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:18,578
dollars.

44
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,079
My prize was I fell in love in

45
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:25,877
this game, love at first sight.

46
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,588
>> Oh, my god.

47
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,798
>> What?

48
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,132
>> The little chick.

49
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,009
>> Oh, man.

50
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,593
>> This thing is newborn, like

51
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,261
today.

52
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:35,512
>> Wow.

53
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,179
I am really sorry.

54
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,808
I mean it.

55
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,683
>> PROBST: And we'll delve

56
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,060
deeper into<i> Survivor's</i> most

57
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,229
controversial season ever.

58
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,314
>> This was a racially based set

59
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,315
of tribes.

60
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,400
I think it'll be interesting to

61
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,652
see if there really is cultural

62
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,152
bias.

63
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,530
You know, the Asian tribe,

64
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,031
they're not all from one

65
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:57,242
country, per se, I'm assuming.

66
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,077
And I'm a white guy, but I'm a

67
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,663
white Jew.

68
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,622
>> You represent your race.

69
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,582
It's not about avoiding.

70
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,208
It's always a wall.

71
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,168
We can never let that wall down

72
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,254
to interact or be honest with

73
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,214
others.

74
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,966
>> It's a little bit

75
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,300
uncomfortable for me.

76
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:14,843
It's like you're trying to

77
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,511
change the world in 39 days, and

78
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,679
that just made the game that

79
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,348
much harder.

80
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,314
>> Watch it, watch it, watch it!

81
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,525
>> PROBST: 18 days ago, 20

82
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,234
Americans began the adventure of

83
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,279
a lifetime.

84
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,657
They had just two minutes to

85
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,450
gather everything they would

86
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,537
need for the next 39 days.

87
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,918
30 seconds!

88
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,544
>> The chicken!

89
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,336
>> Forget about the chicken!

90
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,046
Let's go!

91
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,632
>> Get overboard!

92
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,425
>> Paddle.

93
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,636
>> Where's the Hawaiian sling?

94
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,805
>> The teams were actually

95
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,390
devised by ethnicity.

96
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,391
You had a Latino team.

97
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,811
You had an Asian team.

98
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,147
You had a Caucasian team.

99
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,273
And then you had an African-

100
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,816
American team.

101
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,942
So I was like, "Oh, snap, you

102
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,484
know, I'm not the only token

103
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:18,364
brother for once."

104
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,118
>> Ah!

105
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,536
>> I personally feel like the

106
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,331
division is kind of strange.

107
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,415
Like, I've never been separated

108
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,292
because of my skin color before,

109
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,546
and I don't really like it.

110
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,008
>> Row, row!

111
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,386
>> The Asian invasion!

112
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,013
>> I'm pretty, you know, as

113
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,264
Americanized as you can get.

114
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,265
At the same time, I mean,

115
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,558
growing up, there were times

116
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,601
when people would make

117
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,518
presumptions about me or make

118
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,561
fun of me or insult me because

119
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,521
of my ethnicity.

120
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,689
I remember when I was a kid,

121
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,523
every time we put up Christmas

122
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,733
lights, young kids would come by

123
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,819
and smash our Christmas lights.

124
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,449
>> To me, being a Dominican

125
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,618
American is just a conversation

126
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,079
piece.

127
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:06,788
Because, like, being a

128
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,497
Dominican, what is that going to

129
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,873
do for me out here?

130
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,999
I think that means squat.

131
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,875
I think the content of your

132
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,628
character means everything.

133
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,671
Building stuff, there should be

134
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,215
the shelter, plus I know how to

135
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:17,548
make a toilet.

136
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,050
>> You want the machete?

137
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:19,759
>> Well, no.

138
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,593
First I'll just explain it to

139
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,302
you, and then we'll all be,

140
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,387
like, on the same page.

141
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,138
We'll all have the blueprint.

142
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,223
>> Do you want them with us?

143
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,099
>> They're going to do the

144
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:26,766
leaves and stuff.

145
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,475
They don't really need to hear

146
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,768
all this part.

147
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,644
>> PROBST: At Aitu, Billy

148
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,603
quickly found himself on the

149
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,190
outs...

150
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,191
>> It was kind of obvious to me

151
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:36,943
that he didn't really know

152
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,445
exactly what he was doing.

153
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,029
>> PROBST: ...forcing Ozzy to

154
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,614
step up.

155
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,533
>> Oh, my god.

156
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,660
>> I mean, he may not be very

157
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,078
big, but he's an athlete, and

158
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:47,704
he's somebody who'd be pretty

159
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,081
good at this game.

160
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:50,957
>> Really good job.

161
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,376
>> Good job.

162
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:53,835
>> PROBST: On Puka...

163
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,169
>> You've got a touch of bad

164
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:55,920
wind.

165
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,671
>> PROBST: ...Cao Boi resorted

166
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,380
to some traditional healing.

167
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,215
>> There, you'll feel better

168
00:04:59,298 --> 00:04:59,424
now.

169
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,885
>> It looks like it's burned.

170
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,469
Does it hurt?

171
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,304
>> I've never been accepted by

172
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,223
the Asian community.

173
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,391
I just don't fit the stereotype.

174
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,559
It's a very dangerous position

175
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,395
for me to be in.

176
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,021
>> You all know what this is,

177
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,148
right?

178
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,692
Represent, represent, represent!

179
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,986
>> Whoo!

180
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:20,945
>> PROBST: At Hiki, Sekou

181
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,529
quickly emerged as a natural

leader.

183
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,450
>> Okay, everybody, focus, okay?

184
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,327
Focus on what we're doing.

185
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,787
>> Is it smoking?

186
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,371
>> Yeah.

187
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,539
>> Come on, oh, yes!

188
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,415
>> Yes!

189
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,083
>> PROBST: And then almost as

00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:34,959
quickly...

00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:35,918
>> I need a break.

192
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,336
>> PROBST: ...burned out.

193
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,254
>> Want to do it?

194
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,088
>> Yeah.

195
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,673
>> It's all for you.

196
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,008
>> Hey, y'all, look, a boat!

197
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,176
Look!

198
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,302
>> What?

199
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,762
>> Yeah, we upgraded!

200
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,846
>> PROBST: But as this never-

201
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,264
before-seen footage shows, it

202
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,432
wasn't just Sekou who lacked

203
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,517
outdoor skills at Hiki.

204
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,604
>> Be careful.

205
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,736
>> Look at all the water in our

206
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,737
boat.

207
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,446
>> You know, we thought we were

208
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,281
all canoe tight, like, "Yeah,

209
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,032
we're going to row this thing

210
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,035
out."

211
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,829
That was easier said than done.

212
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,997
>> Oh!

213
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:13,623
>> Oh, no!

214
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,459
>> I'm trying to hold it!

215
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,710
>> We're a bunch of city kids.

216
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,003
It's not that we are black,

217
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,880
white, Asian, Latino.

218
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:21,547
It's not that.

219
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,758
We're city kids.

220
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,717
We have one person who's from

221
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,511
the South.

222
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,554
>> Oh, no!

223
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:28,888
Oh, you okay?

224
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,264
>> Yeah.

225
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,474
>> It's harder than it looks.

226
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,475
>> You know paddling isn't our

227
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,060
specialty.

228
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:34,560
>> No, the whole boat

229
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,480
experience, rafts, boats,

230
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:46,572
anything on water that...

231
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,366
>> I don't know everything, but

232
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,367
I never got on a boat that did

233
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,661
that.

234
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,746
>> I have no clue.

235
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,088
>> So are you getting in the

236
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,297
front?

237
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:03,881
>> It really doesn't matter to

238
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,048
me.

239
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,300
I'll do it either way.

240
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,718
>> I'll be in the driver's seat.

241
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,886
>> We're about to go out,

242
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,012
Candice and I, catch us some

243
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,140
food.

244
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,558
Ready?

245
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,475
I'm dying for some protein, so

246
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,518
hopefully we can catch some fish

247
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,520
and get that.

248
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,146
Hopefully by the end of the day

249
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:28,573
we'll have all that for us.

250
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,574
>> PROBST: Day two at Raro found

251
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,575
Adam and Candice eager for an

252
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,660
adventure.

253
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,790
>> PROBST: But when the weather

254
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,250
turned, the adventure went

255
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,835
south.

256
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,586
>> I mean, we're getting pulled

257
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,838
away from our island.

258
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,672
>> I know.

259
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,548
I don't know what to do about

260
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,633
it.

261
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,646
Found a little sandbar here to

262
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,856
hang out at, because every time

263
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,524
we try to start paddling, the

264
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,901
current's so strong, it actually

265
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,987
brings us straight back.

266
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,325
Cold?

267
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:16,162
>> Yeah.

268
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,163
>> We'd been out there for

269
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:17,747
hours.

270
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,998
We were exhausted.

271
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,874
It was awful.

272
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,583
I mean, we were shivering.

273
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,294
My knees were shaking.

274
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,254
My jaw was shivering.

275
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:25,880
We were wet, and it's just the

276
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,716
frustration wearing on you.

277
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,634
It's the worst situation I've

278
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,261
been in in a long, long time.

279
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,512
I want to do something.

280
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,096
I don't want to sit...

281
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,722
>> Yeah, I don't think we can

282
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,556
paddle it.

283
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,475
I really don't.

284
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,142
>> You know, we're just going to

285
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:42,438
have to sacrifice the boat.

286
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:42,772
>> What is that?

287
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,482
>> I hope that's not them

288
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,775
flipped over.

289
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,737
>> Oh, my god.

290
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,866
>> I don't even see a boat.

291
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,451
>> You know, with the wind and

292
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,161
the current, I mean, we were

293
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,621
shivering, and we were freezing,

294
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,456
and we were exhausted.

295
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:00,790
It was awful.

296
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,792
But we finally made it back.

297
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,585
>> Can you see the little speck

298
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,295
out there?

299
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,004
>> That's our boat?

300
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,339
>> Yeah, I think so.

301
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,215
>> Did it flip over?

302
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:09,966
>> No.

303
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,716
>> Wait, it's not flipped over

304
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,550
or anything?

305
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,385
>> No, no.

306
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,427
It's anchored to the sandbar.

307
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,887
>> You couldn't paddle it?

308
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,139
You guys were too tired?

309
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,432
I was concerned about Candice

310
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,309
and Adam, when they came back

311
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,310
without the boat, and they're,

312
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,021
like, shivering and purple.

313
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,356
And then after I got over my

314
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,692
initial concern, I'm concerned

315
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,067
about the boat.

316
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,610
We need that to go fishing.

317
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,321
Like, we need food.

318
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,239
>> I just can't stand giving up,

319
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,115
you know?

320
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,825
>> Yeah, I know.

321
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:44,917
>> Save the other leaves for

322
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,459
when we make the tent for

323
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,627
tomorrow.

324
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,379
>> Why do you say we need more

325
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,005
cross bars?

326
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:49,672
>> Because when you look

327
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,339
underneath, they're starting to

328
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,465
bow.

329
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,091
We probably just need one more.

330
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,509
>> Oh, okay, that's fine.

331
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,260
>> All right.

332
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,011
>> There's a couple here.

333
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,720
>> PROBST: While the Aitu tribe

334
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,430
worked on their shelter, Billy,

335
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,014
in this new footage, went to

336
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:06,856
work on Aitu.

337
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,481
>> Well, strategically, first I

338
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,566
went up to J.P., and I set up an

339
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,233
alliance with him right away.

340
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:09,984
Me and him to the end, that was

341
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:10,484
the first thing I said.

342
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,444
And he didn't want to hear why.

343
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,529
He was just happy with it.

344
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,627
But we don't want to get caught,

345
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,754
like, a surprise challenge, then

346
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,921
we lose, and then right away we

347
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,089
go to tribal, and then we don't

348
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:32,882
know what we're doing.

349
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,758
The next thing I did was I went

350
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,926
up to Christa and Cecilia, and

351
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,386
I put the idea in her head.

352
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,846
It's like you want to hope for

353
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,680
the best, but you got to prepare

354
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,682
for the worst.

355
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,641
If you two are going to get

356
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,476
together, then I want to be with

357
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,018
you two.

358
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,102
>> Right.

359
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:45,895
>> You know, it's out there so

360
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,605
we don't get caught.

361
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,606
We can just like... you know,

362
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,065
whatever, give a sign.

363
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:49,732
>> Okay.

364
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,817
>> And then we know.

365
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,777
I was trying to play both sides

366
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,487
of the fence, because this game

367
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,155
shifts so much that if you rely

368
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,740
on just one alliance or one

369
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,242
person to get you to the end,

370
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,914
you're not going to make it.

371
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,624
>> PROBST: Hiki has their torch!

372
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,042
They're coming back!

373
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,251
At the first immunity challenge

374
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,586
on day three...

375
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,838
Puka wins the challenge!

376
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,757
...Puka, Aitu, and Raro won

377
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,884
immunity and flint to make fire.

378
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,803
Hiki was not so lucky.

379
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,846
No fire for you, somebody going

380
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,764
home.

381
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,557
But a surprise was revealed.

382
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,393
The losing tribe will choose one

383
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,769
person from any of the other

384
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,314
tribes to go to Exile Island.

385
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:30,940
And the two men of Hiki chose

386
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,858
Jonathan.

387
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,819
On Exile Island, Jonathan

388
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,945
searched for the hidden immunity

389
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,196
idol.

390
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,823
>> The idol!

391
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,282
I'm cold, miserable, shivering.

392
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,369
Exile Island's really terrible.

393
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,832
>> PROBST: Back at the Hiki

394
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,041
camp, as this new footage

395
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:49,959
reveals, the tribe considered

396
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,294
the consequences of losing the

397
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,880
first challenge.

398
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,923
>> I think today we learned a

399
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,717
lot about working as a team.

400
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,553
>> Rather than us trying to do

401
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,387
50 things?

402
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,806
>> Yeah.

403
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,765
>> I don't like being on a

404
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,142
losing team.

405
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,185
I don't like it.

406
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:08,853
But you know, we're sticking

407
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,728
together.

408
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,855
We're keeping our spirits up.

409
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:11,480
>> You know, it's only natural

410
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,065
that we're all just like...

411
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:15,776
I mean, I might not even say it,

412
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,653
but I think it.

413
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,237
>> Of course.

414
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,904
>> And it's just...

415
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,989
>> If you have any ounce of

416
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,283
awareness, you know, I think you

417
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,285
do.

418
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,703
>> I knew that I gave it my all

419
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,581
and that should be enough.

420
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,666
But now, because it's been

421
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,167
divided by race, it's not

422
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,836
enough.

423
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,921
And that's how the group pretty

424
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,132
much feels, because we do, on

425
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:38,924
some level, feel like we're

426
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,926
representing a race.

427
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,761
If whatever we... if we lose a

428
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,929
challenge or we don't succeed in

429
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,432
something, it has nothing to do

430
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,433
with the color of our skin.

431
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:47,975
>> No!

432
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,894
>> Nothing.

433
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,146
We're just all people trying to

434
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,899
succeed in a game.

435
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,984
Now it was just figuring out who

436
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,778
was the weak link within our

437
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,947
tribe, which, again, doesn't

438
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:02,823
have anything to do with the

439
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,241
color of a person's skin, just

440
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:08,537
personality, who clashes.

441
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,330
>> PROBST: At the first tribal

442
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,206
council...

443
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,165
First person voted out of

444
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,668
<i>Survivor: Cook Islands...</i>

445
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,836
...the women of Hiki decided

446
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,464
that Sekou was their weak link.

447
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:23,844
Sekou, the tribe has spoken.

448
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,386
>> I knew my head was on the

449
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,514
chopping block.

450
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,140
Nathan kept warning me all along

451
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,892
that the sisters would stick

452
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,393
together.

453
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,686
I don't know, maybe they felt I

454
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,480
was taking a leadership role and

455
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,940
they needed to get me out.

456
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,441
There were some things that I'm

457
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,067
not knowledgeable about, but I

458
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,901
was willing to come out here and

459
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,945
learn.

460
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,446
I take a lot of pride in that.

461
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,447
You know, that's what made it

462
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,783
such an adventure for me.

463
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,084
>> Let me just say straight out,

464
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:55,918
like, I trust you.

465
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,378
>> No, that's what... you were

466
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,088
from the very beginning, yeah.

467
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,589
>> PROBST: On day three, Yul and

468
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,840
Becky formed an alliance at

469
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,092
Puka.

470
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,134
>> Sticking together, obviously,

471
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:04,969
would help us in the game.

472
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,178
>> I want to stay together.

473
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,513
I agree.

474
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,098
Yul and I are both Asian, both

475
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,183
Korean, that we're automatically

476
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,268
going to form alliances because

477
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,269
of that.

478
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,729
In Korean, you call an older

479
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,897
brother an<i> opa,</i> and he seems

480
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,065
sort of like an older brother to

481
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:23,737
me, and I trust him a lot.

482
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,156
>> Oh, this is good eating.

483
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,158
These are some kind of nuts.

484
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:28,742
I don't know what they call

485
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,994
them.

486
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,036
>> PROBST: Later, Cao Boi and

487
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,662
Yul searched for food and common

488
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,415
ground.

489
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,291
>> You mentioned the other day

490
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:35,916
that people assume that you're

491
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,750
Japanese.

492
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,376
Why?

493
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,295
>> I look... I look Japanese.

494
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,254
I go to Vietnam, they all try to

495
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,589
speak Japanese to me.

496
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,715
But then I tell them, "No, why

497
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,382
don't you look at a history

498
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,508
book?

499
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,552
This is your ancestor's face."

500
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,928
"No!"

501
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,014
"All of you look Chinese to me."

502
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,140
They don't like that, but they

503
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,392
do.

504
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,560
>> A lot of people can't

505
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,811
differentiate among Asian

506
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:56,520
Americans.

507
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,688
I mean, "Asian American" is a

508
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,314
very broad term that encompasses

509
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,482
a broad range of communities,

510
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,359
and we're not all alike.

511
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,902
>> Each one of us is an

512
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,945
ambassador of our own race,

513
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,738
right?

514
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,363
>> Yeah.

515
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,072
>> We play for our team.

516
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:07,323
>> Right.

517
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,866
>> And when we're in the merge

518
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,825
together, we keep an eye out for

519
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:10,868
each other.

520
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,535
That's going to be the

521
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,411
difference between our culture

522
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,954
versus others.

523
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:14,288
>> All right.

524
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,623
>> I'll see you, brother.

525
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,332
Good job.

526
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,876
Thank you.

527
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,504
>> PROBST: At Aitu, Billy wasn't

528
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,256
pulling his weight.

529
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,841
>> We lose Billy, we come back

530
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,134
stronger than ever.

531
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,177
>> PROBST: So Ozzy suggested a

532
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,012
bold plan to throw the challenge

533
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,889
and oust Billy.

534
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,307
>> Billy is just dead weight, so

535
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:33,974
we might as well cut our losses

536
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,393
now and get on with the game.

537
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,686
>> PROBST: J.P. was on board,

538
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,063
but Christina was skeptical.

539
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,773
>> I'm thinking, "You know, this

540
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,649
doesn't seem right."

541
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,316
I don't know if I can trust

542
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,942
Oscar anymore.

543
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:44,860
>> PROBST: But at the

544
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:45,402
challenge...

545
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,028
Puka's on the course.

546
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,528
Raro's on the course.

547
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,238
Hiki's on the course.

548
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,032
...Ozzy's plan went into action.

549
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,825
Aitu completely unconcerned

550
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,202
about this challenge.

551
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,038
Puka, Raro, Hiki all safe from

552
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,041
tribal council.

553
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,251
Aitu came in dead last and chose

554
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,002
Yul from the Puka tribe to go to

555
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,463
Exile Island.

556
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,631
Yul, boat's waiting for you now.

557
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,757
Before the tribes parted, Billy

558
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,800
thought he and Candice made a

559
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,885
connection.

560
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,059
>> PROBST: At Aitu's tribal

561
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,936
council on night six, J.P.

562
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,229
confronted Billy about his work

563
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,980
ethic.

564
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:22,898
>> I came here to play the game.

565
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:23,982
That's my dream.

566
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:24,692
>> Part of the game is trying to

567
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,484
involve yourself.

568
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,193
That way, people find...

569
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:26,985
>> Well, excuse me, I'm still

570
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,528
talking here.

571
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,153
>> That way, people find you as

572
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:28,654
value...

573
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,196
>> I'm still talking here.

574
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:29,863
You'll get your turn.

575
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,489
>> That way, people find you as

576
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:30,739
valuable.

577
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,573
>> I'm still talking here.

578
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,199
You'll get your turn, Mr. Bully.

579
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:32,825
>> Because obviously you're not

580
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,575
valuable.

581
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,159
>> My prize isn't even the

582
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:34,535
million dollars.

583
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,119
My prize was I fell in love in

584
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,204
this game, love at first sight.

585
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,540
Her name is Candice, and in

586
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,666
between...

587
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,917
(<i> laughter</i> )

588
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,918
>> PROBST: Candice from Raro

589
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:43,502
tribe?

590
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,211
>> Yeah.

591
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,254
After the last challenge, we

592
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,422
sort of mouthed the words "I

593
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,631
love you" to one another.

594
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,757
So that was my prize.

595
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,385
My prize was her.

596
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,469
>> PROBST: In the end, Billy's

597
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,555
tribe mates cut him lose.

598
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,641
Billy, the tribe has spoken.

599
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,230
>> Wow.

600
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,773
I learned so much about myself.

601
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,524
First of all, I learned what my

602
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,400
priority was.

603
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,568
I learned that I'm not motivated

604
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,235
by money.

605
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,278
I never was.

606
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,571
This game definitely favors

607
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,656
those that are willing to stoop.

608
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,866
That part of the game, I kind of

609
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,075
wish I'd have did without and

610
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,660
just played, you know, to have a

611
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,120
good time.

612
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,371
I'm definitely not the conniving

613
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,330
type or whatever.

614
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:20,748
That's not for me.

615
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,957
That was definitely the wrong

616
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,501
way to go.

617
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,344
>> PROBST: On day six, Yul made

618
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,179
the most of his time on Exile

619
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,431
Island.

620
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,726
>> Oh, mama.

621
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,769
I found the immunity idol, which

622
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,395
is probably the single biggest

623
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,272
stroke of luck I could have had.

624
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,356
>> PROBST: and in this never-

625
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,107
before-seen footage, Yul

626
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,318
destroyed the note and covered

627
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,903
up all evidence of him finding

628
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,031
the hidden immunity idol.

629
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:54,907
>> I didn't want the box lying

630
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,742
around on the island, so I

631
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,326
constructed a little raft made

632
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,661
out of coconut husk, and I'm

633
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:07,836
going to set it adrift.

634
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,087
>> PROBST: With the idol gone,

635
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:14,384
everyone else searched in vain.

636
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,928
>> Okay.

637
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,305
"Use the mast and an island to

638
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,017
form a letter.

639
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,560
Block out the south, and you'll

640
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,103
be doing better."

641
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,689
Okay.

642
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,566
So many places it can be.

643
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,193
I'm just going to cover a big,

644
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,072
wide swath 20 feet long and

645
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,950
three feet down.

646
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,034
If I don't find it, well, it's

647
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,077
not from want of trying, you

648
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,703
know.

649
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,704
Boy, I could use a toothbrush

650
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,707
real bad.

651
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,968
>> I have a good chance of

652
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,177
finding it if I'm digging in the

653
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,887
right place, but I guess anybody

654
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,764
has a good chance of finding it

655
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,307
if they're digging in the right

656
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,226
place.

657
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,520
And it's got to be in between

658
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:10,899
here somewhere.

659
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,859
>> "If the southern isle

660
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,443
vanishes, a salvation you'll

661
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,320
find."

662
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,446
That makes me think that I

663
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,533
should head that way.

664
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,958
>> I don't know if the idol is

665
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,252
even still here.

666
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,296
Right now I'm just kind of

667
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:38,760
digging wherever.

668
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,012
>> PROBST: All right, drop your

669
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,556
buffs.

670
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,808
On day seven, the four

671
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,685
ethnically divided tribes merged

672
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,605
into two very diverse groups.

673
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,315
You are the new Aitu tribe.

674
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,067
You are the new Raro tribe.

675
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:54,610
Two new tribes, a whole new

676
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,987
game.

677
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,113
>> Yeah!

678
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,616
(<i> cheering</i> )

679
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,123
>> One, two, three, Raro!

680
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,458
>> You just moved up, girl.

681
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,921
(<i> laughter</i> )

682
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,713
>> At first it's going to be all

683
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,964
smiles and "A pleasure to meet

684
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,632
you, and we're glad you're

685
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,550
here."

686
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,843
But in the back of your mind,

687
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,928
it's a game, and you're in it to

688
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:21,553
win it for yourself-- and first

689
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:26,892
and foremost, cold, hard cash.

690
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,936
(<i> cheering</i> )

691
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,145
>> PROBST: At the new Aitu

692
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:30,646
tribe, Jonathan and Becky

693
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,272
understood this immediately, and

694
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,233
the game was on.

695
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,068
>> I trust Yul.

696
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:36,985
I trust Candice.

697
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,612
>> I totally agree.

698
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,113
Becky came right to me.

699
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,114
She said, "Yul and I would like

700
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:41,949
to get together with you and

701
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:42,699
Candice."

702
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,742
I said, "I believe that I have

703
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,618
Flicka."

704
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,661
Stay with me and Candice, and

705
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,828
we'll take these other two, and

706
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,704
the five of us will go to the

707
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,456
merge.

708
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,415
>> PROBST: And Yul solidified

709
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,458
his bond with Becky.

710
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,335
>> I found the idol.

711
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,128
>> Oh, I'm so excited!

712
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,046
I'm so proud of you.

713
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:01,677
That's so awesome.

714
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,387
>> PROBST: Back at Raro, Parvati

715
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,472
saw an opening of her own.

716
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,473
>> There are so many men on this

717
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,474
tribe now.

718
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,475
It seems like we got all the,

719
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,309
like, really big, buff guys.

720
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,061
Your pants are falling off,

721
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,229
Nate.

722
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,105
I'm absolutely going to flirt

723
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:13,897
with them.

724
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:18,986
It's what I do best.

725
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,112
>> I think Parvati feels really

726
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:24,992
safe because the guys love her.

727
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,118
She's, you know, a happy-go-

728
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,620
lucky, young, adorable girl, and

729
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,621
I don't think they want to see

730
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,580
her go at all.

731
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,415
She's entertainment for them.

732
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,457
You know, it's like watching a

733
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,501
movie to them, sitting around

734
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:38,588
and letting her be adorable.

735
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,382
>> Bombs away.

736
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,383
>> Okay, mama, you do that one

737
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,467
more time, I'm going to come up

738
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:42,718
there...

739
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,011
When I first saw Parvati, I was

740
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,390
like, "Damn!"

741
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,350
>> Boys will be boys, you know?

742
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,227
There's nothing else going on on

743
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,519
this island.

744
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,897
There's no music, no anything.

745
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,399
So what else are they going to

746
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:57,691
think about?

747
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,526
They're bored, you know?

748
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,778
>> She likes to put on her buff

749
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,114
as a miniskirt.

750
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,824
It's great scenery.

751
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,325
>> So I want to get in tight

752
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,535
with all the guys, work on them

753
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,953
and manipulate them and stuff

754
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:10,829
like that.

755
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,997
Like, I haven't even begun to

756
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,416
work my feminine ways.

00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,235
concocted a different plan.

948
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:15,860
>> Why don't we switch this up

949
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,737
and just have all the girls

950
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,321
align right now and get rid of

951
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,614
J.P.?

952
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,281
>> That's what I say.

953
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,242
Women should stick together.

954
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,868
It's five women, four men.

955
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,286
So if we're going to do any type

956
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,287
of alliance, it needs to be done

957
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,248
right now, tonight, if any of

958
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,207
the women really want to stay in

959
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:37,674
the game.

960
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,216
>> PROBST: But when Artie

961
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:38,842
expressed reluctance, the girls

962
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,886
approached Brad.

963
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:45,974
>> Wow.

964
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,642
>> PROBST: And, as seen in this

965
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:48,184
new footage, they approached

966
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,228
Nate as well.

967
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,939
>> Hey, listen.

968
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,193
>> Whoa!

969
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,153
No!

970
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,112
>> Yeah.

971
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,196
>> No!

972
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,488
>> Uh-huh.

973
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,198
>> No!

974
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,950
You guys are stupid!

975
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,326
That's not smart.

976
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,995
We need his strength.

977
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:07,787
>> We'll be fine.

978
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,456
We're still stronger than the

979
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,874
other team.

980
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,499
I thought it was Stephannie too,

981
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,959
but...

982
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:13,918
>> PROBST: But J.P. was kept

983
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,795
completely in the dark.

984
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,672
>> And I was just so pissed at

985
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,924
myself and wanting us to win so

986
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,093
badly and not feel like I had

987
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,011
given it 100%.

988
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,181
>> Yeah, I hear you.

989
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,016
But you know it kills everybody.

990
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,100
>> I just set myself up to go

991
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,768
home.

992
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,645
>> You're a beautiful, beautiful

993
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,147
person.

994
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,732
>> Thank you.

995
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,650
He actually came up very

996
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,818
confident that I'm leaving

997
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,070
tonight, and I played right

998
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,572
along with him and said, "You

999
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:42,947
know, thanks.

1000
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:43,948
I've had a great time.

1001
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,701
I'll miss you guys."

1002
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,369
So I basically played my tail

1003
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,580
off on that one.

1004
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,664
You know, I hate that it has to

1005
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,083
be like this, but, you know, you

1006
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:54,959
do what you do, and you go out

1007
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,086
on top, and you smile, hold your

1008
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,213
head high.

1009
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,131
>> You've been... your face just

1010
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,091
makes me... kept me going.

1011
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,385
Definitely, definitely.

1012
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,178
And I will think about your face

1013
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:05,887
every single day.

1014
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,763
>> Oh!

1015
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,014
Thank you, baby.

1016
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,682
I appreciate it.

1017
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,225
>> I think this will be the

1018
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,102
hardest vote ever any of us will

1019
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,188
ever have to do.

1020
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,105
>> PROBST: J.P. never saw it

1021
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,691
coming.

1022
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,568
At tribal council, everyone but

1023
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,028
Nate pitched in and gave him the

1024
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,488
boot.

1025
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,447
Fourth person voted out of the

1026
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,573
Cook Islands...

1027
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,574
>> Wow.

1028
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,575
>> PROBST: J.P., you need to

1029
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,076
bring me your torch.

1030
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,994
>> Damn, you guys outwitted me

1031
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,037
big time.

1032
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,081
>> PROBST: J.P., the tribe has

1033
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:43,675
spoken.

1034
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,259
>> My biggest attribute is my

1035
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,177
loyalty, and I think my biggest

1036
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,303
attribute was my biggest

1037
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,555
downfall, because I think I

1038
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,056
trusted people too much, and

1039
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,058
everyone that I trusted ended up

1040
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,935
not working out for me.

1041
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,020
>> PROBST: On day 12, Aitu let

1042
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,272
the reward challenge slip from

1043
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,608
their fingers.

1044
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,318
Jessica drops out.

1045
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,696
Raro wins reward!

1046
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,073
(<i> cheering</i> )

1047
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:07,949
And Raro took home wine and

1048
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,993
fishing supplies.

1049
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:10,535
>> That's what I'm talking

1050
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,911
about!

1051
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,455
>> PROBST: that night, as seen

1052
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,124
in this new footage, Raro

1053
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,209
celebrated.

1054
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,085
>> Are we just going to drink

1055
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:19,460
out of the bottle?

1056
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,628
>> Yeah.

1057
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,254
>> We're swigging out of the

1058
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:21,921
bottle.

1059
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,173
>> I'm down with that.

1060
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,425
>> We won some wine, so we're

1061
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,009
getting our fade on, which is

1062
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,177
quite nice.

1063
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:28,970
>> That's what I'm talking

1064
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,305
about, dog.

1065
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,056
>> You know, we can all get

1066
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,558
loose, and I think everyone's

1067
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,851
real personalities are going to

1068
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,436
kind of come out when we get a

1069
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,478
little booze in us-- especially

1070
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,396
Stephannie.

1071
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,689
She don't ever drink.

1072
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:40,148
>> Is it good?

1073
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,108
>> It tastes like a buttery

1074
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:45,069
Chardonnay.

1075
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,281
>> We're all happy.

1076
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:52,535
>> No!

1077
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,204
(<i> laughter</i> )

1078
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,122
>> Let's get this party started!

1079
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,583
Keep it going, dog!

1080
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,876
>> She's a lightweight here.

1081
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,045
>> She drunk?

1082
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,379
>> Mama's drunk.

1083
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,047
>> I'm taking care of my mama.

1084
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,174
I'm taking care of my mama.

1085
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,592
>> Mama needs to lay down.

1086
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,343
She hasn't eaten anything.

1087
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,553
>> Oh, my god!

1088
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,596
She's wasted.

1089
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,099
(<i> laughter</i> )

1090
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,101
>> Stephannie's, like, on some

1091
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,645
drugs right now.

1092
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,856
She is torn back.

1093
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,775
>> Give her another shot!

1094
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,275
(<i> laughter</i> )

1095
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,193
>> It's funny, though, because

1096
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,070
you can tell she's like the good

1097
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,488
old Southern mom who doesn't get

1098
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,364
faded.

1099
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,907
So, like, a couple of sips, so

1100
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,532
she's kind of like... she's more

1101
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,326
than drunk.

1102
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,497
Home girl's on another level.

1103
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,498
>> You all right?

1104
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,124
>> Hold her up!

1105
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,250
>> Stephannie had about,

1106
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,378
probably, like, three swigs, and

1107
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,381
she's delirious.

1108
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,882
She's just talking nonsense and

1109
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,509
kind of almost passing out.

1110
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,427
It's really cute.

1111
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,348
>> Walk this way.

1112
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,434
>> Good girl!

1113
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,445
>> Okay, we need to get...

1114
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,488
>> What are we doing with it?

1115
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,489
>> We need some coconut juice.

1116
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,115
We need to open up some

1117
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,074
coconuts.

1118
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,409
We need coconut pieces and then

1119
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,911
a little bit of saltwater.

1120
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,121
>> PROBST: On day 13, Christina

1121
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,957
was getting on Raro's nerves.

1122
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,041
>> Then we got to that pot, take

1123
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:22,417
it to the water.

1124
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,960
>> We're all annoyed by

1125
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:24,711
Christina.

1126
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,878
She tells people, "Can you do

1127
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,671
this?

1128
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:31,050
Can do you that?"

1129
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,594
Christina is coming across as,

1130
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,762
like, our new J.P.

1131
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,473
So she better watch herself.

1132
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,525
>> Mine are worse, aren't they?

1133
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,901
Are mine worse?

1134
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,321
>> Yours aren't that bad.

1135
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,114
>> PROBST: At Aitu, Ozzy had a

1136
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,283
difficult time getting Candice,

1137
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:59,662
Sundra, and Becky motivated.

1138
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,830
>> Do any of you guys want to go

1139
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,206
out in the boat to the reef, go

1140
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,251
do some relaxing diving?

1141
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,295
>> Yeah.

1142
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,005
The fish are right out there.

1143
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,673
>> The reason that I hesitate to

1144
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,216
go is that I get really cold.

1145
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,551
>> Yeah.

1146
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,135
>> If it was sunny, I would be

1147
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,220
out there all day.

1148
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,222
I feel like once I get really

1149
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,140
cold, I'm just, like, sitting

1150
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:19,807
there, and I'm no good for doing

1151
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,602
anything.

1152
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,978
>> It's starting to get really

1153
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,189
trying on my patience, and it's

1154
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,482
getting harder and harder for me

1155
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,941
to motivate to want to go out

1156
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,694
and fish when I know that I get

1157
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,946
one-eighth of the fish that I

1158
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,240
catch, and the rest of it goes

1159
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,367
to, you know, some people that

1160
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,162
aren't as deserving.

1161
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,246
>> Go for it, guys.

1162
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,332
It'll be a little hot.

1163
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,124
>> Everyone get a crab who wants

1164
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,878
a crab?

1165
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:49,754
>> I'll eat the bones when

1166
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:50,588
you're done if you're not going

1167
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,380
to eat them.

1168
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,925
>> Eat the bones?

1169
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:54,967
>> I'm annoyed that these

1170
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:55,885
princesses sit around.

1171
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,302
They eat the most.

1172
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,387
They consume the most calories,

1173
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,722
and they expend the least.

1174
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,890
They don't appreciate a darn

1175
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:01,849
thing.

1176
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,975
They appreciate when they eat it

1177
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,393
that it tastes great.

1178
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,561
But watch out, there's a knife

1179
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,395
poised at your back at all

1180
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:18,282
times.

1181
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,992
>> PROBST: Later, Ozzy, Cao Boi,

1182
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,202
and Jessica set out to explore

1183
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,204
the neighboring island.

1184
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:23,746
>> I don't want to go back,

1185
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,580
almost.

1186
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,164
>> PROBST: And they made a

1187
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,916
surprising discovery.

1188
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,042
>> Why is their tribe here?

1189
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,252
>> How you doing?

1190
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:29,836
>> PROBST: And Raro was not

1191
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:34,257
pleased.

1192
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,175
>> How are you, my man?

1193
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,552
>> Hi, Cao Boi.

1194
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,594
>> Parvati.

1195
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,428
>> You're Parv...

1196
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:39,720
>> Parvati.

1197
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,930
>> Par...

1198
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:41,931
>> Par-va-ti.

1199
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,933
>> Par-va-ti.

1200
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,517
>> I didn't like it at all.

1201
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,018
I don't think they should be on

1202
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:46,811
our island.

1203
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,603
This is our turf.

1204
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,521
This is our territory.

1205
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,690
They got their own island.

1206
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,743
>> PROBST: On day 14, Aitu won

1207
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,287
the immunity challenge.

1208
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:10,084
Aitu wins immunity!

1209
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,460
>> Damn!

1210
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,838
>> PROBST: And Raro was united

1211
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,464
on who should go next.

1212
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,427
>> Okay.

1213
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,304
>> Yeah, yeah.

1214
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:21,929
>> PROBST: But Stephannie's talk

1215
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,264
of home...

1216
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,223
>> I can easily see myself going

1217
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,349
home and getting some mashed

1218
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,601
potatoes and gravy.

1219
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,685
>> PROBST: ...made the tribe

1220
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,562
question their decision.

1221
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,229
>> She's already mentally

1222
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,482
checked out.

1223
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,525
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

1224
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,651
Christina realized she was on

1225
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,486
shaky ground.

1226
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,779
>> Just her personality.

1227
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,655
You know, it can be a little

1228
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,364
nerve-racking sometimes.

1229
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,240
>> PROBST: Fifth person voted

1230
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,366
out of the Cook Islands...

1231
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,327
But it was Stephannie who was

1232
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,661
sent back to the home she missed

1233
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,079
so much.

1234
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,080
Stephannie, the tribe has

1235
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,374
spoken.

1236
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,584
>> Actually, I'm extremely proud

1237
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,586
that I made it for 14 days.

1238
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,795
Sure, I would have loved to have

1239
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,297
stayed in the game a lot longer.

1240
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,256
You know, anybody would be.

1241
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,675
I think what took me out of the

1242
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,719
game was the emotional aspect of

1243
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,386
missing my family, and that

1244
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,472
really started messing with my

1245
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,432
psyche.

1246
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,815
>> PROBST: After tribal council,

1247
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,566
Christina confronted her

1248
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,026
accusers.

1249
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,902
>> For the past few days, you

1250
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:18,945
guys have been kind of rude, and

1251
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:19,820
I've notice it, like when it

1252
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,030
comes to passing things.

1253
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,073
You snapped at me twice.

1254
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:22,865
>> I said you were annoying.

1255
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,659
It's just the way... I mean,

1256
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,162
it's just the way it is.

1257
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:29,664
>> I never thought that's what

1258
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,248
they thought of me.

1259
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,291
But I'm going to stick my head

1260
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,461
up high still.

1261
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,420
You know, I've gone through a

1262
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:36,754
lot of stuff.

1263
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,380
I've been shot and all that

1264
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,173
stuff.

1265
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:39,840
I mean, yeah, that's a tragedy

1266
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,800
of my life.

1267
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,676
I know I survived a lot of other

1268
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,468
things in my life, and I'll

1269
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,428
survive this.

1270
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,513
>> PROBST: But the next day,

1271
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,516
Christina couldn't let it go.

1272
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,809
>> I'm not a robot.

1273
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,643
Just because I'm a cop doesn't

1274
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,519
mean I don't have emotions.

1275
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,144
I have emotions just like you

1276
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:52,979
and anyone else.

1277
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,563
>> Right.

1278
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,523
>> And you know what?

1279
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,148
I was going to say something,

1280
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,191
and I'm like, "You know, what?

1281
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:57,817
If they have a problem, they'll

1282
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,317
say something to me."

1283
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,193
And I actually asked Adam in the

1284
00:37:59,277 --> 00:37:59,819
boat, "Is everything okay?

1285
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:00,486
Why are you yelling?"

1286
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,070
You didn't say anything about

1287
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,324
being annoying.

1288
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,451
>> I'm just like, settle down.

1289
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,452
I mean, it just... it's nerve-

1290
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,247
racking sometimes.

1291
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:11,872
>> Well, then you should have

1292
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:12,540
said something.

1293
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,457
>> I said you were annoying.

1294
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,250
>> No, you didn't say it.

1295
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:14,875
>> I don't know how else to tell

1296
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,376
you.

1297
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,210
>> Honestly, you didn't say it.

1298
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:16,836
I swear to God you didn't say

1299
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,503
it, and I never swear to God.

1300
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,005
>> Well, I swear I did.

1301
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:19,588
>> Maybe you thought you did.

1302
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,966
>> Christina, I said it to you.

1303
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,050
>> Nope.

1304
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:23,676
>> She said over and over again

1305
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,343
that she wished we would tell

1306
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,387
her the way she is and be open

1307
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,348
and up front.

1308
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,725
You know, if she needs to know

1309
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:37,606
it, then I'll tell her.

1310
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,691
>> PROBST: At the challenge...

1311
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,734
Good news/bad news.

1312
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,735
Good news is the winners will

1313
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,653
feast.

1314
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,405
Bad news is you'll be feasting

1315
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,489
at tribal council, because win

1316
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,659
or lose, both tribes are going

1317
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,535
to tribal council tonight.

1318
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,287
>> Ooh!

1319
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,329
>> PROBST: Go!

1320
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,039
>> Let go.

1321
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,040
>> PROBST: Aitu endured a brutal

1322
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,583
test of physical strength...

1323
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,543
Jonathan and Yul taking on Nate.

1324
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,420
...and handed Raro a beat down.

1325
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,841
Aitu wins the challenge!

1326
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,425
Here's how it's going to work

1327
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,301
tonight.

1328
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,135
Aitu will go to tribal council

1329
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,344
first.

1330
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,138
You will vote somebody out.

1331
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,723
You will then enjoy your feast

1332
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,433
while listening in on Raro's

1333
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:17,480
tribal council.

1334
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,149
Thinking Jonathan had the

1335
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,151
immunity idol, Cao Boi dreamed

1336
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:22,777
up a scheme to get the idol out

1337
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:30,242
in the open.

1338
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,327
>> Plan Voodoo would split our

1339
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,244
votes between Jonathan and

1340
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,871
Candice.

1341
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,164
I think the plan is ingenious.

1342
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:35,790
I know that neither Jonathan or

1343
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,582
Candice has the immunity idol,

1344
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:40,419
because I have it.

1345
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,629
>> PROBST: At tribal council...

1346
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,546
Sixth person voted out of

1347
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,881
<i>Survivor: Cook Islands.</i>

1348
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:44,965
...Plan Voodoo never came to

1349
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,175
fruition.

1350
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,593
Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken.

1351
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,386
And Cao Boi's wild ways finally

1352
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,263
got him voted him out.

1353
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,098
>> I was perfectly comfortable

1354
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:52,556
in terms of survival.

1355
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,475
It was the human element that I

1356
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,476
overlooked.

1357
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,519
The Puka tribe caught me by

1358
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,521
surprise.

1359
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,522
I thought their parents had

1360
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,523
taught them honor.

1361
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,608
I thought they would know what's

1362
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,735
right and what's wrong about not

1363
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,529
screwing somebody over or back-

1364
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,822
stabbing anybody, but I guessed

1365
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,492
it wrong.

1366
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,285
>> PROBST: After Cao Boi's

1367
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,204
departure, Aitu indulged in a

1368
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,831
succulent reward...

1369
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,415
>> People in our group plain out

1370
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,042
said, "You're annoying."

1371
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:20,793
>> PROBST: ...while listening in

1372
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,585
on Raro's drama.

1373
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,545
>> Unfortunately, she just found

1374
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,381
out our true feelings.

1375
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,382
>> PROBST: Then another

1376
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:26,674
surprise.

1377
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,510
Aitu, you will now kidnap one

1378
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,096
member from the Raro tribe.

1379
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,180
They will be a part of your

1380
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:33,764
tribe through the next reward

1381
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,308
challenge.

1382
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,059
Aitu, who are you going to

1383
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,060
kidnap?

1384
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,519
>> Nate.

1385
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,312
>> PROBST: Nate, I owe you some

1386
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,522
food.

1387
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,648
Nate had a hearty meal...

1388
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,108
Seventh person voted out of the

1389
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,317
Cook Islands...

1390
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:45,860
...before Christina was sent

1391
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,485
packing.

1392
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:51,949
Christine, the tribe has spoken.

1393
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,117
>> Being a police officer, you

1394
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,701
know, you would think you come

1395
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,786
into a game playing it a certain

1396
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,247
way and use my experience.

1397
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,331
But you know, at the same time,

1398
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,791
you realize you're human.

1399
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,251
You're a person.

1400
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,460
You're going to have emotions.

1401
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,461
You're going to go through

1402
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,171
different things like anyone

1403
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,088
else.

1404
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,214
I would do it all over again,

1405
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:07,882
and I'm glad I got the

1406
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:12,595
opportunity to do it.

1407
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,846
>> PROBST: Where 20 once stood,

1408
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:18,893
only 13 remain.

1409
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,311
How will Nate's time at the Aitu

1410
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,188
tribe affect strategy?

1411
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,063
>> I've got my eyes open very

1412
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,648
much.

1413
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,149
>> PROBST: What further

1414
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,483
adventures will the survivors

1415
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,652
face next?

1416
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,904
What future twists will impact

1417
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,113
the game.

1418
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:31,739
The losing tribe will take back

1419
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:36,327
to camp with them this bottle.

1420
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,120
You have ten seconds to decide

1421
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:38,746
whether or not you change your

1422
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,915
fate in this game.

1423
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:41,749
Join us as the adventure

1424
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,709

about the fact that they we're
