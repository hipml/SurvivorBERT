00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,000
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,200
18 new castaways 
were divided into three tribes:

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,500
Muscle, Intelligence and Beauty.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,200
Welcome to Survivor Cagayan.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,200
In the Beauty tribe, 
LJ was suspicious of Morgan.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,900
Either she already has the idol, 
or she has a clue.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,200
While Morgan suspected 
that Brice and her

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
had against them 
a covenant of four:

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,700
LJ and Jeremiah 
and Alexis and Jefra.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,200
Brice and I, we stick together. 
He protects me.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,900
They tried 
to recruit Jeremiah.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,200
We country 
people have to stick together.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,200
Meanwhile, in the Muscle tribe, 
Tony was going at top speed,

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,300
finding an idol... 
That's huge.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,000
... et manipulant sa tribe.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,600
- Are you a cop? 
- No why?

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,700
- Do you swear? 
- I swear.

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,300
I wondered for a moment 
if I should tell him I'm a cop.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,800
But if I say so, they'll try 
to take me out by surprise right away.

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,500
Immunity test...

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,800
The Muscle Tribe wins!

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,400
...The Intelligence tribe 
continued to self-destruct.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,500
J'Tia is starting to panic!

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,300
Beauty wins!

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Squandering their huge lead, 
they lost their second race in a row.

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,900
Back at camp, 
things got worse.

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,400
Garrett decided 
to hold a public vote.

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,500
Kass, do you have an opinion?

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,700
J'Tia.

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,500
But it didn't have the desired effect.

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,700
Garrett, you are an idiot!

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,700
At the council, the women decided

34
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,100
that strategy 
was more important than eating.

35
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,900
They eliminated Garrett, 
leaving Spencer alone.

36
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,100
Garrett, the tribe has spoken.

37
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,300
Who wants to 
welcome me to the bottom of the tribe?

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,300
Sixteen remain. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

39
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,300
I didn't see it coming.

40
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,700
The advice was a disaster.

41
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,700
Garrett has been bad enough

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,900
so that the girls prefer 
the one that destroyed all our food.

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,100
Which is crazy. 
I am clearly alone against all.

44
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,200
I'm gonna need all kinds 
of crazy ideas to stand a chance.

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,800
If he hadn't organized 
his mock council...

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It would have been J'Tia, 
if we could have talked in private.

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I arrived at the council 
thinking of leaving.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,500
But I had a lot of luck, 
a lot of Kass.

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,000
This tribe is a disaster, 
but it's entertaining.

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
We'll see what happens.

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,100
I was going to vote for J'Tia, 
I was serious saying it.

53
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,500
When did you change your mind?

54
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,700
When I found out 
you and Kass Garrett had an alliance.

55
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,700
Yeah...

56
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm still mad 
at the rice, mad at J'Tia,

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,500
but I have no agreement with Spencer.

58
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,500
I will do my best to 
drag Kass into an alliance of girls.

59
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,900
Spencer is not going to stop there.

60
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,600
- He's the next to go. 
- Yes, I was thinking about that.

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,100
He's the next to go.

62
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,400
- Let's do this between girls. 
- Let's go.

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,300
When I got to the council, 
I didn't know who to vote for.

64
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,400
But Garrett, he's fun 
to watch, but not to play.

65
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,200
"J'Tia has her character",

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,100
but rice can be replaced, 
and now she is afraid.

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,900
Then I think she will be loyal to me.

68
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,400
I hope you wo 
n't prefer Spencer to me.

69
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,100
- Because I... 
- Damn, no!

70
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,100
Damn no!

71
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,600
I do not trust anyone. 
They are against me.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,300
It's me, myself, my idol, 
and me again. We are four.

73
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,300
But I was alone by the fire, 
and Sarah arrived.

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
"Let's give him 
something and see."

75
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,300
I've been a cop in a big city 
for thirteen years.

76
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,400
"Listen, Sara".

77
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
"I'm also a cop, 
you were right."

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,300
How did you know?

79
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,900
I can see it.

80
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,100
I've been a cop for seven years..

81
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,600
My wife has been a cop for eight years.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,900
Damn, I knew it, man.

83
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,900
I say. No problem.

84
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,800
Some say cops 
spot each other like gays.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,900
I know how to recognize a cop.

86
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,900
And Tony is a cop.

87
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,100
I knew it from day one. 
And he finally told me.

88
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,400
I thought I won the lottery.

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,500
"Damn it! I knew it!"

90
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,400
Can you imagine what we could do?

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,900
Can you imagine 
two cops...? Cops'R'Us!

92
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,700
Now that I know he is a cop, 
the solidarity of the "blues" plays.

93
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,900
The cops stick together. 
He will be loyal.

94
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,300
And I'll be by his side, believe it. 
We'll do the 400 shots together.

95
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,700
It's Cliff and Lindsey.

96
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,400
They wanted to take out Trish, 
but then it was you,

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,300
because you are too smart.

98
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,300
I told Sarah about a conversation 
between Cliff and Lindsey,

99
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,200
but it was a pure lie.

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,700
I just told him that 
to lure him to my side.

101
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,500
It's us against the rest of the world.

102
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,000
- On my badge. 
- OK.

103
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,300
To me, that means nothing.

104
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,900
You can swear on your children, 
your family, your dead grandmother...

105
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,400
Doesn't matter. It's just words.

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,300
I never trust anyone.

107
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
Me neither, at this point.

108
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,200
And you shouldn't.

109
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,500
It's not true, this rain!

110
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,800
Come on!

111
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,800
It really sucks.

112
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,500
It's really rough.

113
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,400
This weather is 
the worst experience of my life.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,500
It's the monsoon, or a hurricane.

115
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,800
Everything is soggy.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,300
I'm desperately trying 
to preserve that little spark.

117
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,900
But everything is soaked. 
Basically, we're screwed.

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,300
Miserables. Completely miserable.

119
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,200
It's rough.

120
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm kidding, 
but it's not funny.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
You know what they say, huh?

122
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,000
The sun always rises in the morning.

123
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,000
Look at the water!

124
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,900
Look at this!

125
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
There are others?

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,700
This rain is treacherous, treacherous, 
freezing, torrential.

127
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,000
But that's it, Survivor!

128
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Hopefully 
it will calm down soon.

129
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,500
Otherwise, the night will be long.

130
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,000
Drink some water, kid.

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,800
Oh, that's good, Woo.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,700
I haven't been dry for more than 
two hours straight on this island.

133
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,200
It's raining nonstop. 
It's tough on morale.

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,100
We are all miserable.

135
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,400
That's how I imagine hell.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,200
If only 
we had won this tarp!

137
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,200
We've been up all night.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,900
Since sunset, 
we are there to snuggle up.

139
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,700
I think my fingernail is broken.

140
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,500
He must have fallen 
because he's soggy.

141
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,300
This is the 
most ridiculous situation I have ever known.

142
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,400
And I would have preferred to avoid it.

143
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,300
I don't sympathize with Lindsey,

144
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,700
because last night 
I spoke with Tony,

145
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,200
and he informed me that Cliff 
and Lindsey had talked about me,

146
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,700
which immediately 
pissed me off.

147
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,600
- Tell me. 
- This is what I heard:

148
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
"We can eliminate Trish 
whenever we want."

149
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,000
"When we want."

150
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,300
"It's Sarah, the smart one." 
That's what they said.

151
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,000
"I like Sarah."

152
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,100
"It's a game, 
you have to stay focused."

153
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,200
That's what he said. 
I'm telling you.

154
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,900
Police solidarity, mate.

155
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,300
We formed Cops'R'Us last night.

156
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
- Cops'R'Us. 
- But be serious.

157
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,100
- If you panic... 
- It won't happen.

158
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,400
That's why 
I wanted to talk to you.

159
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,100
I had to find you, Tony.

160
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,100
If you betray your word, 
it's Survivor, that's one thing.

161
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,900
But if you say "police solidarity" 
and then betray me...

162
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,500
No. That's why I said that.

163
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,000
- OK? 
- Absolutely.

164
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,300
He knows that I will be loyal, 
and vice versa.

165
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,800
We shook hands again.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,800
There couldn't be 
a more sincere handshake.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,400
I trust him 110%.

168
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,200
When you finally told me, 
- "I knew it!".

169
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,900
OK see you.

170
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,600
Whatever you tell someone, 
you can't trust them.

171
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,300
I don't trust anyone 
here, anyone.

172
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,300
None of them.

173
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,900
And I'm sure it's mutual.

174
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,100
If it could stop, 
just ten minutes...

175
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,900
Just enough to take 
a turn and take a breather.

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,900
What do these flies have? 
They adore us!

177
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
I feel like I'm 
in a Survivor nightmare.

178
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,700
It's horrible. Last night 
we had a terrible storm.

179
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,100
Our clothes are soaked. 
They won't dry out today.

180
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,200
Our fingers, see, 
are completely...

181
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,300
We've been in the water 
for almost 24 hours.

182
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,800
We haven't slept.

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
We didn't eat anything at all, 
no way to make a fire.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Reality takes over. 
It's really very hard.

185
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
Do you think we should 
strip down and go in the water?

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
I'm afraid of being even colder.

187
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,300
We need another plan 
for tonight, otherwise it won't work.

188
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,800
Unfortunately, Jefra 
complains a lot but does little.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I know what that means.

190
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,800
"Jeremiah and LJ, prepare the shelter!"

191
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,500
You have to work hard to 
get out of it in a survival situation.

192
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:28,300
And the beauty stereotype is 
starting to apply.

193
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,700
These girls do nothing. 
They are on another planet.

194
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,700
- It's not so bad. 
- Yeah, it looks drier.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,500
It's definitely drier.

196
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,400
You have to put palm leaves on it.

197
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,900
Otherwise it won't hold.

198
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,100
This is one of those situations 
where I have to shut up.

199
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,600
To not become a target.

200
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,700
I had never seen the monsoon.

201
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,900
There, I am in the first row.

202
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,100
I'm frozen.

203
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,500
We're wet, soggy, 
we're not about to dry out,

204
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,400
and my mind is constantly active.

205
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,300
I thought on day 1, 
when I knocked out Morgan,

206
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,800
we arrived at the camp 
and she arrived from the reef.

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,300
That she was there for no reason... 
She must have had a clue.

208
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,600
So I said to myself that I was going to 
see if I didn't find an idol there.

209
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Who would look for 
an idol in the middle of a hurricane?

210
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,700
This guy! That's why 
I found it.

211
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,000
I have the immunity idol.

212
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,700
I was taught that hard work pays off. 
We reap what we sow.

213
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,100
Now I have an ace in the game.

214
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
It does not have a price.

215
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Now I have 
to find a hiding place for him.

216
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,100
I keep it to myself, 
no one will know that I have it

217
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,200
before I play it.

218
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
- Tree mail. 
- Our favorite place.

219
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,700
There is mail.

220
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,100
- A small... 
- Character.

221
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,100
Something positive, please!

222
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,400
We have a small character. 
Like a Buddha.

223
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,300
Maybe a meditation test. 
The one who meditates the longest.

224
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,400
- Who wants to read? 
- Me.

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,400
"You will be misled and lost. 
That's for sure."

226
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,100
Un labyrinth.

227
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,100
"In this ordeal, 
the tribe works together,

228
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,500
throwing little 
buckets of water from the ocean

229
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,100
in a bigger bucket, 
at the end of a seesaw beam.

230
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,000
Gaining immunity is also 
gaining drier shelter."

231
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
A tarp.

232
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
I need rice.

233
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,700
I really want rice.

234
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Yes, let's cook some.

235
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,400
- I have to eat something. 
- And water.

236
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,700
J'Tia threw away 95% of our rice, 
but she asks how much to cook.

237
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,100
"You're kidding?". 
It is ironical.

238
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
It's a mess here.

239
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,700
A trial awaits us, 
someone might leave,

240
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,100
and my first idea, 
- "let's practice".

241
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,100
Let's hurry.

242
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,000
I would like us to train 
different techniques.

243
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm going to do some 
interior decorating.

244
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,300
Sorry, I'm really dehydrated.

245
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,200
Priorities are wrong.

246
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,600
And people look at me like 
I'm the crazy one.

247
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,700
You should really 
want us to practice.

248
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,300
Really.

249
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,800
- You know what I mean. 
- I want us to be good, yes.

250
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,300
If we lose, someone leaves.

251
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,700
Drinking is also essential.

252
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,800
It's weird being the only man.

253
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,900
I have to be patient, 
manage my emotions, keep my spirits up,

254
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,700
and I must try to come out 
of this tribe alive.

255
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,100
The problem 
is that it disperses.

256
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,500
Like that? Nope?

257
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,700
I think you have to 
give it a shot.

258
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,700
What I did was perfect.

259
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,000
Non.

260
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
A little high.

261
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,500
Lower I can handle.

262
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,300
In height, I do not like.

263
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,600
The jet should not 
be too high.

264
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,600
Not in the face.

265
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,300
Fix my coco.

266
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,900
So. You have to have a target.

267
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,500
I like the technique of the hand.

268
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,700
Yes exactly.

269
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,900
Oui!

270
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,300
Over here, everyone!

271
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,100
Muscle and Beauty, discover 
the new Intelligence tribe.

272
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,100
Garrett was eliminated 
at the last council.

273
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,600
Again, 
shocked reactions.

274
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,500
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

275
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,100
First of all, 
I take back the idols.

276
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

277
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,900
Today you will draw 
water from the ocean with a bucket,

278
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:07,400
then you will pass it 
between team members to a container.

279
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,000
When it is full, 
it will release a ball.

280
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Two team members will use it 
to solve a vertical maze.

281
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
The first two tribes to finish...

282
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,900
gain immunity, 
are shielded from the vote.

283
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,900
The losers go to the council,

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,500
where a third person 
will be eliminated from Survivor Cagayan.

285
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,100
You are also playing for a reward. 
Want to know what's at stake?

286
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,700
Considering the weather, it will help you a lot.

287
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Comfort and protection.

288
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,300
Oh my God!

289
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:53,100
Blankets, pillows, mosquito net, 
and a tarp to stay dry.

290
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Whatever the state of your shelter, 
a tarp will improve it.

291
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,200
For the second tribe...

292
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,100
No comfort, but 
the protection of a tarpaulin.

293
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,100
A lot at stake in this event.

294
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,900
Muscle, you have two 
more limbs. Who will not participate?

295
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,500
Lindsey and me?

296
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,800
Jeff, Lindsey and me.

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,700
Tony and Lindsey do 
not participate in the Muscle Tribe.

298
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Tribu Beauté, two people 
will not participate. Which?

299
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,200
- Me, Jeff. 
- And me.

300
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,300
Jefra and Alexis. 
Take a seat on the bench.

301
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,600
The others, one minute to 
get organized, and we'll begin.

302
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Let's go!

303
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,000
For immunity and reward! 
Survivors, ready?

304
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,300
Teamwork is the key.

305
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,600
Attractive!

306
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,400
First throw the bucket, 
then throw the water.

307
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,900
Whatever comes to you, 
you have to pour it out.

308
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,300
You need to collect as much 
water as possible in each round.

309
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,700
Once the container is full, 
the ball will be released,

310
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
and this step will be completed!

311
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,700
Kass, not much in the bucket!

312
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,800
From the start, Beauty leads.

313
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,100
Muscle is right behind.

314
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,400
Intelligence is last, 
as usual.

315
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,700
Spencer desperately tries 
to change things.

316
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,400
He goes as fast as he can, 
to Tasha, then to J'Tia.

317
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
Who is soggy!

318
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,000
Very little water reaches Kass!

319
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,300
The Beauty tribe stands out.

320
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Whatever they do, it works.

321
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Awesome throw from the Muscle Tribe!

322
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,600
But throw!

323
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,900
Tasha and J'Tia still have 
trouble communicating.

324
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Beauty is about 
to finish this first step.

325
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Muscle is second, 
Intelligence always last.

326
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,100
There is advice tonight, 
you have to speed up!

327
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Beauty is very close. 
Morgan touches it.

328
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,700
That might be enough.

329
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Let's go!

330
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
It's good for the Beauty Tribe!

331
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,700
Start the maze!

332
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,400
The second place is played 
between Muscle and Intelligence.

333
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,000
Beauty works on the maze.

334
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,300
Shoot first!

335
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Cliff has another bucket of water, 
and that'll be enough for Muscle!

336
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,000
Go for it! Start the maze!

337
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,100
Don't give up, Intelligence!

338
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,300
- Left or right? 
- Not important.

339
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,500
Two tribes are 
on the vertical maze.

340
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,800
The Muscle tribe and the Beauty tribe.

341
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Once again, Intelligence 
tries to get back into the ordeal.

342
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,100
They are far enough away.

343
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,100
As soon as she goes down, 
I pull on my side.

344
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,900
You have to coordinate 
to get the ball out,

345
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,400
until she falls.

346
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,300
Intelligence 
still hasn't won.

347
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,300
Once again, no water 
in J'Tia's bucket for Kass.

348
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,900
Slight advance of Muscle 
in the maze.

349
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,500
But Beauty is just behind.

350
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,100
You just have to make sure you 
don't finish last!

351
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,300
That's enough!

352
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,800
Intelligence attacks the maze.

353
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,000
A new opportunity 
to earn their name!

354
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,700
But Muscle and Beauty had 
plenty of time to move on,

355
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,100
and to understand 
a complicated maze.

356
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,900
Muscle is getting closer. 
They understood!

357
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,800
They are one move 
away from victory!

358
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,500
Here we are! That might be enough!

359
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,300
Muscle gains immunity 
and reward!

360
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,500
There is still a place!

361
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Intelligence is back!

362
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,700
Start again!

363
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,300
They collaborate well for 
the first time in this event!

364
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,500
Another big move 
for the Intelligence Tribe!

365
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,600
Beauty is now in trouble!

366
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,800
Intelligence has never been 
so close to completion.

367
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,000
They would come a long way.

368
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,600
The Beauty Tribe is falling apart!

369
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,800
Intelligence is almost there!

370
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,800
Big move for Intelligence!

371
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,100
That should do!

372
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,200
Intelligence wins immunity 
and reward!

373
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,600
No advice, for 
the first time this season!

374
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Oh my God!

375
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,400
Muscle tribe, congratulations. 
Immunity, again!

376
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,500
No advice, 
and a nice reward.

377
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,200
Tribu Intelligence, 
you've been waiting a while.

378
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Taste immunity! 
It is deserved.

379
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,100
And there's a tarp with it.

380
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,500
Muscle, come get 
your reward.

381
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,300
Enjoy a new evening 
without advice.

382
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,500
Intelligence, come and get 
your tarp, go back to camp.

383
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,900
- I will miss you on the council. 
- We won't miss you.

384
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,900
Beauty, I have nothing for you,

385
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,300
except an appointment with me 
tonight at the council,

386
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,300
where someone will be 
the third person eliminated.

387
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,100
Take your things, return 
to camp. See you at the council.

388
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,700
Our dear home!

389
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,600
Look at this mess. 
See you later, palm leaf!

390
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
We tore it all up again.

391
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,200
We all know how to keep 
our cool under pressure.

392
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,200
It will be waterproof.

393
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,900
We have the cover, we have the comfort. 
That's crazy.

394
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,600
I feel alive again. 
Let it come, the rain!

395
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,600
Let's set up the hammock!

396
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,500
When we brought back 
the elements of comfort,

397
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,900
I thought to myself that there was perhaps 
a clue or an advantage in it.

398
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,300
My brain is spinning 
and theirs aren't, I guess.

399
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,400
I don't know what happens to them.

400
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,100
But I immediately thought 
that I had to grab everything.

401
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,700
I took the hammock out of the way, 
in case something fell.

402
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,800
I open it, and a piece of paper 
resembling a clue falls out.

403
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,700
I put my foot on it. 
I look, there is no one.

404
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,700
I pick it up 
and put it in my pocket.

405
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,100
It's not that I need it, 
I already have the idol.

406
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,500
But I wanted to make sure

407
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,500
that if there was something, 
a clue, an advantage,

408
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,800
I put my hand on it,

409
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
that no one else sees it.

410
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,700
That's what I did.

411
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,700
That's great!

412
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,300
Oh my God. 
The first element of comfort.

413
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,800
Does anyone mind 
if I go in the hammock?

414
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,300
I hope you fall on your ass.

415
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,100
I just wanted to sit there!

416
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,700
Dreams come true in Survivor!

417
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,900
Sorry.

418
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,300
We win as a team, we lose as a team.

419
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,100
You have assured with water. 
Nice job, Morgan.

420
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,100
Oh my God. 
You had such a lead...

421
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,400
I hate 
making excuses for myself, so...

422
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,900
We did not succeed.

423
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,000
Here, we are confronted 
with a lot of elements at the same time.

424
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,600
Stay alive!

425
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,900
We're in the middle of a hurricane.

426
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,500
We lost the race. 
We are exhausted.

427
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,800
And now we're going to the council.

428
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,400
The atmosphere on our camp 
will become very dark.

429
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,800
It will fill 
with negativity and suspicion.

430
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,200
A silly question... 
Anyone want to leave?

431
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,000
It's stupid, but in case 
anyone gets bored...

432
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,600
Might as well ask the question.

433
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,500
Tonight, we're finally going to the council. 
It had to happen eventually.

434
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,200
Jeremiah, me, Alexis and Jefra 
are on the same wavelength.

435
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,700
Between Morgan and Brice, 
only Brice worries me.

436
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,700
He looks like the guy 
who will be formidable at the end of the game.

437
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,600
It is better to act 
against Brice now.

438
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,500
It will be Bruce.

439
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,000
If anything happens, 
it will be Brice.

440
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,900
I think, yeah.

441
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm afraid the tribe 
agrees

442
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,100
that I am not 
physically dangerous,

443
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,200
but that I am socially.

444
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,100
They might target me, 
but I trust Jeremiah.

445
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,400
I just want to make sure we're 
okay with eliminating a girl.

446
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,200
What do you really think?

447
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,700
I'm thinking of Alexis, but...

448
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,700
Did LJ talk to you?

449
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,200
Not really, he thinks...

450
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,200
He thinks of you.

451
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,300
If it's me, he'll target you next.

452
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,100
I do not know.

453
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,100
Don't try to convince him. 
Are you up for voting Alexis?

454
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,800
Then we should stick together 
and vote Alexis.

455
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,700
OK.

456
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:36,600
LJ believes he is allied 
with Alexis, Jefra, Jeremiah.

457
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,100
But in reality, 
Jeremiah is with Brice and me.

458
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,500
I didn't think I was 
going to council tonight.

459
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,800
It sucks.

460
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
We need to talk to him.

461
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,500
For tonight, we are trying 
to recruit Jefra, to make it 4-2.

462
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,700
What's new?

463
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,800
We want you to vote Alexis with us.

464
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,100
I know you two are 
good friends, but...

465
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,100
Why not eliminate LJ instead?

466
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,700
We need him for the tests.

467
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,400
Jeremiah is coming to talk to you.

468
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,900
When did you speak with Jeremiah?

469
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,000
The last days.

470
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,600
And he's leaving?

471
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,500
LJ thinks Jeremiah 
is in his alliance.

472
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,900
Morgan, Jeremiah and Brice are allies.

473
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,000
They're going to vote Alexis tonight. 
What's going on?

474
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,300
Is Jeremiah 
with Alexis, LJ and me?

475
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,400
Or with Brice and Morgan?

476
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,800
I do not know. 
That's what we said...

477
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
I do not know.

478
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,600
I may have the opportunity 
to speak with Jeremiah.

479
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,100
He will come talk to you.

480
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,900
People are throwing out strategies 
that I didn't know anything about.

481
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,400
It's totally crazy.

482
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,500
This advice does not excite me, 
because someone is going to have a surprise.

483
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,100
Morgan came to say 
crazy things to me.

484
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,800
- What did she say? 
- That you are allied with Brice and her.

485
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,600
And that Brice, she and you 
are going to vote Alexis.

486
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,400
- Don't. 
- OK.

487
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
- So the plan holds? 
- Yes.

488
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,000
- You, me, LJ and... 
- Alexis.

489
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,200
You, me, LJ and Alexis, 
we vote for Brice.

490
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,800
- Are we still okay? 
- Yes.

491
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,900
Jefra does not want to vote against Alexis.

492
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,500
Brice and Morgan are going to vote Alexis.

493
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,800
So... I'm stuck.

494
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,700
Share the votes? 
Is there a risk?

495
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,700
I do not think so. If we tie 2-2, 
and they have 2 against someone...

496
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,600
- There will be a tie. 
- And we'll vote again.

497
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,100
And then, if no 
one leaves an idol, we all vote for Brice.

498
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,600
I don't believe there is 
any risk in sharing.

499
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,400
So who...

500
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,900
The boys vote for Brice, 
the girls vote for Morgan.

501
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,000
Brice or Morgan 
could have an idol,

502
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,500
so we're going to split the votes.

503
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,700
The two boys will vote Morgan, 
the two girls will vote Brice.

504
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,700
If neither of 
them leaves an idol, we will vote again,

505
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,500
and we will all vote for Brice.

506
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,500
Are you sure that can't 
get one of us out?

507
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,600
There is always the fear 
that an idol will be played.

508
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
If I get my majority to split 
their votes, there will be a tie.

509
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,700
And I will be in the center.

510
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,500
We share.

511
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,500
The boys for Morgan, 
the girls for Brice.

512
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,900
We can do that.

513
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,900
If I go with Brice and Morgan, 
I can eliminate Alexis.

514
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,800
My main goal 
is to control the tribe.

515
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,400
Above all, I hope to become a majority.

516
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,700
Be sure to vote Alexis, 
please.

517
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,700
I'm not worried, 
I trust Jeremiah and Morgan.

518
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,700
It sucks. 
Our first tip...

519
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,200
I don't know what to expect.

520
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,300
Jefra seems much more comfortable 
with Jeremiah than with LJ.

521
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,100
Our alliance will be revealed, 
everyone will know their position.

522
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
I have a big decision to make.

523
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,300
I can go with LJ, Alexis 
and Jefra, or with Brice and Morgan.

524
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,300
Going to the council with all 
the power is an incredible feeling.

525
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,700
But I'm just a country boy, 
I don't want to hurt anyone.

526
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,500
And with this vote, 
it might be.

527
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,500
Some will lose their confidence,

528
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,100
this is probably 
what will hurt me the most.

529
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,100
Behind you, torches.

530
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,100
Take one, 
bring it close to the fire and light it.

531
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,350
It's part of 
the tribal council ritual,

532
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,900
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

533
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,200
When your fire goes out, 
it's the end for you.

534
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,100
Morgan, let's talk about you being 
made into the Beauty Tribe.

535
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,900
Does this tribe embody 
some of the clichés about beauty?

536
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,700
Yes, we have beautiful faces.

537
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,600
What can I say? I like it.

538
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,500
Sorry. 
A bug in my hair.

539
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,900
Brice, how did you feel 
being placed in the Beauty tribe?

540
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,600
I was excited. 
I see myself as a handsome guy.

541
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,400
It goes with inner strength, 
and life experience,

542
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,700
to have this butterfly effect, 
where the caterpillar becomes a butterfly.

543
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,100
I'm in the butterfly stage of my life, 
I'm flying and I'm beautiful.

544
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,300
Jefra, tell me 
about the first days here.

545
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,400
The first few days 
were a bit of a party, Jeff.

546
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,800
We were like friends 
at university, all beautiful, having fun.

547
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,500
Then the storm came, 
and the general attitude changed.

548
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,900
We lost the race today, 
and everyone is paranoid.

549
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:11,400
Because until now, to my knowledge, 
no one had talked about strategy.

550
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,000
Brice, did you feel 
that paranoia this afternoon?

551
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,500
Everyone is worried tonight, 
but there have been discussions.

552
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,700
Groups formed.

553
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,500
Jeremiah and LJ are together.

554
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,300
Alexis and Jefra are together.

555
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,900
Sometimes the four of them are together, 
and Morgan and I are apart.

556
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,600
If you and Morgan are apart, 
are you worried?

557
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,500
There are a lot of discussions.

558
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,500
But some didn't 
discuss strategy with me at all.

559
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,100
Who?

560
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,900
Alexis didn't tell me at all 
about alliances or the game.

561
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,300
So I'm pretty sure 
she's going to vote against me.

562
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,800
Can we deduce 
that you will vote Alexis?

563
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,400
Jeff, I think everyone 
should do their part at camp.

564
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,600
- Three little dots? 
- Three little dots!

565
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,200
Alexis, what do you think? 
Are you doing your part?

566
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,500
He knows the game, he can 
use that to get me out.

567
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,700
I love Brice, 
and being in his company.

568
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,200
I hope that's not the case, 
but it could happen.

569
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,700
Brice, have we wondered 
about the presence of idols?

570
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,500
We discussed it, someone 
might have an idol.

571
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,500
For example Morgan, since 
she was the first on the camp.

572
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,100
I know that the 
possible presence of idols has been discussed.

573
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,800
Morgan, all this 
idol talk,

574
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,300
What do you think?

575
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,900
I'm a little worried, of course.

576
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,700
I think I know where things are going, 
if all goes as planned.

577
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,100
But you can always 
be betrayed without seeing it coming.

578
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,800
Jeremiah, we've established 
that Brice, Morgan and Alexis

579
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,600
are all a little worried.

580
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,900
Do you think you know 
what will happen?

581
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,900
It will be hard.

582
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,300
I think I know what will happen, 
but it will be painful.

583
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,100
But this is Survivor.

584
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,100
There seems to be 
a lot of uncertainty.

585
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,100
Let's end it.

586
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,300
It's time to vote. 
Morgan, it's up to you.

587
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,000
I will count the votes.

588
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,900
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

589
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,900
now is the time to do it.

590
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,900
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

591
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,600
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

592
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,900
I will read the votes.

593
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
First vote.

594
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,900
One vote Alexis, 
one vote Brice, one vote Morgan.

595
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,900
Alexis. 
That's two votes Alexis.

596
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Brice.

597
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,300
Two Brice votes, two Alexis votes, 
one Morgan vote, one vote remains.

598
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,500
Morgan.

599
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Equality.

600
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,400
Alexis, Morgan and Brice, 
you won't vote.

601
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,000
LJ, Jefra and Jeremiah, 
you will vote again,

602
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,500
only for one of these three.

603
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,100
LJ, it's up to you. Come take this.

604
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,300
I will count the votes.

605
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,900
I will read the votes.

606
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,600
First vote...

607
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
Brice.

608
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,200
Third person eliminated 
from Survivor Cagayan...

609
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:05,700
Brice.

610
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,800
That's two, that's enough. 
Bring me your torch.

611
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,800
Brice, the tribe has spoken.

612
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,100
It's time to go.

613
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,600
With this first defeat 
and this first elimination,

614
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,100
you got your first taste 
of how this game really plays.

615
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,700
How long 
will it take for you to recover?

616
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,400
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

617
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,700
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

618
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,000
In the next episode of Survivor...

619
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,700
We could easily 
lose on purpose.

620
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,900
The Muscle Tribe plans 
to betray one of their own.

621
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,300
Let's lose the trial and eliminate him.

622
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,000
And an ordeal leaves 
no one unscathed.

623
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,700
It will leave a mark!

624
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,100
I'm a little mad at Jeremiah.

625
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
He betrayed me, but that's okay.

626
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,300
I'm sure he does 
n't really understand what happened.

627
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,300
I'm surprised 
he can spell my name.

628
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,000
They clearly wanted

629
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,000
get rid of 
the prettiest, the best dressed first.

630
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,100
I am happy to have this title, 
under the vivas.

631
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,600
I hope Morgan does 
well.

632
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,000
As for the others, 
I have forgotten their names.
