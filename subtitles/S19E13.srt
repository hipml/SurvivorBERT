1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,169
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,170
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,463
>> I'm in control of this game.

4
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:06,589
Everything has worked for me so

5
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,590
far.

6
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,217
I set up my alliance so strong.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,803
My people-- they come up to me,

8
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:12,929
they tell me everything.

9
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:13,513
>> PROBST: By day 30, Russell

10
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,724
was driving on cruise control,

11
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,016
mowing down anyone who got in

12
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,684
his way.

13
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,894
>> Now I can comfortably sit on

14
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,563
my throne and watch everybody

15
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,981
bicker at each other.

16
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:23,982
>> PROBST: He felt so

17
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:24,566
comfortable that he let his

18
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,526
guard down and revealed a

19
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,822
secret.

20
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,824
Meanwhile, Shambo had what she

21
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,076
thought was a psychic vision.

22
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,370
>> I had a dream last night we

23
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,371
voted Dave off.

24
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,205
>> PROBST: So she immediately

25
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,540
decided that's what everyone had

26
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,541
to do.

27
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,084
>> I am definitely in a position

28
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,127
of power.

29
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,297
Dave is so gone.

30
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,131
>> PROBST: But Russell decided

31
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,425
that John was the one who needed

32
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,427
to go, so he told everyone but

33
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,803
Shambo to switch their votes.

34
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,387
>> The best way to do this...

35
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,096
>> Uh-huh.

36
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,848
>> ...is John.

37
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,142
It will be you if it's not John.

38
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,143
>> PROBST: Jaison was worried

39
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,770
about going against Shambo's

40
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,480
wishes because her vote is

41
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,230
critical to keeping a majority.

42
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,483
>> You piss off Shambo and she's

43
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,943
going to go to the other side.

44
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,944
>> PROBST: But at Tribal

45
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,863
Council, Jaison and everyone but

46
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,281
Shambo followed Russell's lead.

47
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,325
Tenth person voted out and the

48
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,284
fourth member of our jury--

49
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,537
John.

50
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,580
Eight are left.

51
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:31,257
Who will be voted out tonight?

52
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,259
>> Wow.

53
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,594
John was majorly blindsided, as

54
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,596
was I.

55
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,180
I had no idea they were voting

56
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,139
John.

57
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,518
The plan was to vote Dave, and I

58
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:46,856
am positively stunned.

59
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,858
Okay.

60
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,151
>> So he was trying to get rid

61
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,694
of you, and I didn't want you

62
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,529
to, to, uh...

63
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:52,904
>> Break my word.

64
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,072
>> Break your word to him.

65
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:54,656
>> I couldn't have.

66
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,573
I would have written Dave down

67
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,574
anyway.

68
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,242
>> So everything's still cool.

69
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,285
I don't want you to worry.

70
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,578
Nothing's going crazy or

71
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,663
nothing.

72
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,914
>> All right.

73
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,165
>> My damage control with Shambo

74
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,291
definitely worked.

75
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,127
I just lied to her, which is

76
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:08,711
exactly what I've been doing

77
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,212
this whole time.

78
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,548
I've lied about almost every

79
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,215
aspect of my life.

80
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,551
I'm the richest man here, but I

81
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,094
lied about what I do for a

82
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,220
living because I'll do whatever

83
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,974
it takes to win this game.

84
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,437
>> All right, good night.

85
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,481
This is too easy.

86
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,944
♪ ♪

87
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,085
>> Oh, no.

88
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,170
We're just kind of shooting the

89
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,464
breeze, letting...

90
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,466
>> Oh.

91
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,759
The game's not over yet, you

92
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,760
know.

93
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,096
>> Oh, no, no, not at all.

94
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:00,722
>> Of all the people still here,

95
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,724
who would you guys vote for, I

96
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,642
mean, if you were on the jury?

97
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,935
>> Russell and Mick could get a

98
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,769
lot of votes.

99
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,770
>> Yeah, I think they could.

100
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,730
I think they will.

101
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,772
>> I think Russell is the

102
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,481
biggest threat by far.

103
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,482
>> Yeah.

104
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,108
>> 'Cause people are gonna be

105
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:12,734
like, "That guy played an insane

106
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,359
game."

107
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,360
>> Right.

108
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,278
>> It's always interesting to me

109
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,530
because behind the scenes, it

110
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,406
really has been me and Russell

111
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,407
making decisions, but...

112
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,075
>> Right, right.

113
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,160
>> I kind of left him out there

114
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,995
to be the aggressive bulldog

115
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:24,621
while I kind of stayed behind

116
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,331
the scenes, trying to be nice.

117
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,248
>> Oh, no, that could ruin you.

118
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,249
>> Apparently, that was a...

119
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,417
No, honestly, and I'm beginning

120
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,710
to think that was the wrong

121
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,336
strategy.

122
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,379
This is an interesting phase in

123
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,339
the game because you really have

124
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,423
to start thinking about winning

125
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,301
over the jury, and the way that

126
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,844
I'm gonna try to play the jury

127
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,137
is that the decisions that we

128
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,888
made were group decisions.

129
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:42,972
I had a big part in those

130
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:43,973
decisions.

131
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,891
It wasn't just Russell

132
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,351
unilaterally doing this.

133
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,644
Plus, you know, he was an

134
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:47,977
abrasive guy.

135
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,812
I was the more calm, cool, bond-

136
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,023
with-you kind of guy, so I feel

137
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,316
like I'm the guy that should get

138
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,150
that million dollars.

139
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,234
>> I mean, if I was in your

140
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,278
situation...

141
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,699
>> The interesting thing about

142
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,493
day 36 is that at that point,

143
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,286
there's no hidden immunity idols

144
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,287
anymore.

145
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,997
There's no nothing, so it's--

146
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,539
everyone gets an equal vote,

147
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,210
and...

148
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:12,752
>> Just make it to day 36.

149
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,545
>> Yeah.

150
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,470
>> Today I found out that

151
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,304
Russell already has a lot of

152
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,766
money, and I'm starting to see

153
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,059
some of the cracks in their

154
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,477
armor, and I think this will be

155
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,396
the time that tests their

156
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,065
loyalty to each other,

157
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:34,649
especially as they all have

158
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,401
different opinions of who they

159
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,195
see in the final three, so it's

160
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:39,779
just a matter of time before

161
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,156
that bomb ticks and then blows

162
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,449
up.

163
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,418
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

164
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,338
>> Cool.

165
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,424
>> PROBST: All right, today, no

166
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,635
reward challenge.

167
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,428
Today we're playing for

168
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,389
immunity.

169
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,390
>> Everybody was expecting the

170
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,392
reward challenge.

171
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,518
I'm happier than the reward

172
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,561
'cause I'm ready to start

173
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,146
eliminating some people out

174
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,147
here.

175
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,690
I want to go to Tribal time and

176
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,691
time again.

177
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,608
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

178
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:17,817
to it?

179
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,443
>> Yes.

180
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,194
>> PROBST: First things first,

181
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:20,737
Jaison, I will take back the

182
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:28,578
immunity necklace.

183
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,747
Once again, immunity is back up

184
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,873
for grabs.

185
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,498
For today's challenge, you will

186
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,375
take part in a<i> Survivor</i> bowling

187
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,376
tournament.

188
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,462
Here's how it works-- you will

189
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,422
be randomly matched up against

190
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,757
another person.

191
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,759
Your goal, very simple: roll the

192
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,344

rid of Dave primarily is because

411
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,606

He's not about to take someone

434
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,278
like Shambo that far who could

435
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,821
potentially get a lot of jury

436
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,322
votes.

437
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:43,906
I think we're underestimating

438
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,865
Shambo, though.

439
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,076
Shambo is a hard worker around

440

of the jury is Galu.

444
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,710
They look at Shambo as a strong

445
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,212
woman who really competed in

446
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,630
challenges and kept things

447
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,090
going around camp, who's

448
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,091
always in the running for

449
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,217
immunity.

450
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,135

451

452
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,639
seed and make arguments that

453
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,766
would make Russell sweat.

454
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,226
I mean, with me on Dave's side

455
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,936
and whispering Shambo's name in

456
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,771
Russell's ear, anything can

457
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,397
happen.

458
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,732
I think you should still keep

459
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,109
options open.

460
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,110
>> Yeah.

461
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,194
I'm hearing you, that's for

462
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,195
sure.

463
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:23,946
I have a lot of options in the

464
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,823
game right now.

465
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,575
I can play different ways and

466
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,618
still be okay.

467
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,620
One option I have is keeping

468
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,706
Dave, because I know I can beat

469
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,290
Dave for the million dollars.

470
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,585
Just think, me, Dave, for a

471
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,919
million dollars?

472
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,921
It's a no-brainer.

473
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,381
I have to win.

474
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,133
So it's a good strategic move

475
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,720
to keep Dave around.

476
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,013
I'm gonna tell you, Dave.

477
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,139
>> All right, what's up, buddy?

478
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,015
>> Your best strategic move...

479
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,766
>> Uh-huh.

480
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,268

483
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,563

484
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,647
>> All right, well, it sounds

485
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,648
like you got some thoughts in

486
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,649
your mind.

487
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,525

488
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,526

489
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,193
them.

490
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,486
>> Right now, everybody is

491
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,487
debating you and Shambo.

492
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,196
>> Okay.

493
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,532
>> So if I decide Shambo, I

494
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:08,949
could get Natalie.

495
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,619
>> I could get Brett and Monica

496
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,911
on that, no problem.

497
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,747
>> So that's five right there.

498
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,789
>> That's all we need.

499
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,416
Russell comes to me and says,

500
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,001
"If you, Brett, and Monica vote

501
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,629
Shambo, Shambo goes home."

502
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,171
But I have no idea whether

503
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,048
that's actually gonna happen.

504
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,215
>> You think it's a pretty good

505
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,216
move?

506
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,217
>> Yeah.

507
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,552
Anything that keeps me here

508
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,721
another day sounds pretty good.

509
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,473
Last night, I was pretty sure I

510
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,807
was coming back, but I wasn't

511
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,683
positive.

512
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,646
Tonight...

513
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,063
I don't know.

514
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,065
However, miracles happen

515
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,107
constantly.

516
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,693
If one happened tonight, I would

517
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,362
not be surprised, because the

518

525
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,626
don't even need Shambo.

526
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,086
I could let Shambo throw away

527
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,962
her vote, just like she did

528
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,089
against John, and I can get rid

529
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:12,930

00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,270
You want to have the best shot

573
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,730
you can, if you get to that

574
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,981
final two or three, whatever

575
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:46,940
it ends up being, of

576
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,274
getting votes.

577
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,234
So as far as I'm concerned,

578
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,444
that's probably the three

579
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,653
criteria.

580
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,905
>> PROBST: Shambo, at the last

581
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,072
Tribal Council, you brought up

582
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,491
a different reason which is, you

583
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,325
want to vote people out of this

584
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,702
game that don't deserve to go

585
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,745
to the end.

586
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,788
Still feel that way?

587
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,955
>> Oh, yeah, I absolutely feel

588
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,956
that way.

589
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,625
But by the same token, I

590
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,794
wouldn't have voted John out,

591
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,337
not in a million years, because

592
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,129
he's somebody that I was aligned

593
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,757
with, and I think I was more

594
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,299
blindsided than John was,

595
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,384
truthfully.

596
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,719
>> PROBST: Great working of the

597
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,178
jury, too. Well done.

598
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,056
>> No, this is serious.

599
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,474
>> PROBST: Monica, what about

600
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,809
somebody who's just

601
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,309
unpredictable and you're

602
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,353
getting so late in the game,

603
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,355
you just don't know if you can

604
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,606
count on them or not?

605
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,816
>> I definitely think that

606
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,984
unpredictability is scary at

607
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:31,485
this point in the game.

608
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,320
We're getting low in numbers,

609
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,947
and you want to have someone

610
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,907
that you know you can discuss

611
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,283
the vote with and realize who

612
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,202
do I want to see go to the end

613
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,204
at this point?

614
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,413
>> PROBST: So, Dave, what do

615
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,957
you have to do at this point to

616
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,291
stay in this game?

617
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,668
>> I think you've got to get

618
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,294
people on your side and say, "I

619
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,130
think you have a better shot at

620
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,341
a million dollars with me than

621
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,261
you have with this person over

622
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,471
here who you're currently

623
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,348
aligned with.

624
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,182
>> PROBST: Russell, Dave laid

625
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,351
out a very clear and

626
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,396
potentially effective strategy:

627
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,313
"You are better with me, let's

628
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,190
go to the end."

629
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,358
>> I appreciate that.

630
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,693
It's a good strategy.

631
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,402
The fact of the matter is, if

632
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,404
you know some people are going

633
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,030
to get all the votes, then you

634
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:17,531
want to get rid of them.

635
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,950
That's probably the most

636
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,201
important move of the game to

637
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,327
me, even more than a physical

638
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,247
threat.

639
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,374
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

640
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:27,666
to the vote.

641
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,626
Jaison, for the second Tribal

642
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,003
Council in a row, you have the

643
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:31,587
immunity necklace.

644
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,838
You can choose to assign it to

645
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,505
somebody else.

646
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,506
>> No, I'm keeping it.

647
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,841
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

648
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,425
Jaison.

649
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,301
Everybody else is fair game.

650
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,469
It is time to vote.

651
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,513
Mick, you're up.

652
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,658
>> See you later, Dave.

653
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,559
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

654
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,603
votes.

655
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,070
>> PROBST: If anybody has the

656
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:38,654
hidden immunity idol and you

657
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,697
want to play it, now would be

658
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,741
the time to do so.

659
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,410
All right.

660
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,495
Once the votes are read, the

661
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,288
decision is final.

662
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,373
The person voted out will be

663
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,374
asked to leave the Tribal

664
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,500
Council area immediately.

665
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,543
I'll read the votes.

666
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,715
First vote...

667
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,510
Shambo.

668
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,220
Dave.

669
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,516
One vote Shambo, one vote Dave.

670
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,475
Dave.

671
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,438
Two votes Dave, one vote Shambo.

672
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,107
Dave.

673
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,691
That's three votes Dave, one

674
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:21,321
vote Shambo.

675
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,447
Dave.

676
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,824
Four votes Dave, one vote

677
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,868
Shambo.

678
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,494
11th person voted out, and the

679
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,705
fifth member of our jury...

680
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,706
Dave. That's five.

681
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,498
That's enough.

682
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,501
You need to bring me your torch.

683
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,546
♪ ♪

684
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:46,430
Dave, the tribe has spoken.

685
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,598
Time for you to go.

686
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,767
>> Good game, you guys.

687
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,811
>> See you, Davey.

688
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,901
>> PROBST: Well, for the first

689
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,738
time in this game, the members

690
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,406
who made up the original

691
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,699
Foa Foa have the numbers

692
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,200
advantage.

693
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,535
No matter how bad it seems,

694
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,495
never count yourself out of

695
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,372
this game.

696
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,665
Grab your torches, head back to

697
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,666
camp.

698
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,711
Good night.

699
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,136
>> I wanted a chance to play

700
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,137
the game.

701
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,305
I played my hardest.

702
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:28,680
I went full on.

703
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,390
Russell just played a better

704
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:30,599
game.

705
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,392
I think we all underestimated

706
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,393
Russell.

707
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,978
Man, he's just born to play this

708
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:35,979
game.

709
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,022
I'm bummed that it's over.

710
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,650
Now here I am.

711
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,651
>> PROBST: After the break,

712
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,237
more grudges...

713
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,447
>> The little bitch needs to be

714
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,448
sent home tonight.

715
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,449
>> PROBST: ...more fights.

716
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,450
>> Why would you do something

717
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,451
stupid like that?

718
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,452
>> I did not. I didn't do that.

719
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,453
>> PROBST: ...and more

720
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,454
betrayals.

721
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,497
>> Russell is Russell, so we

722
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,498
got to watch out.

723
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,540
>> That worries me that he's

724
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,875
going to send me home, 'cause

725
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,086
that's what I would do.

726
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,074
>> It's a no-brainer.

727
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:29,699
Well, Brett is just, uh, way too

728
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,617
likable.

729
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,577
He's a nice guy.

730
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,246
He would almost get 100% of the

731
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,747
vote, so Brett is a huge threat

732
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,748
in this game.

733
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,084
That's why I got to get rid of

734
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,128
him next.

735
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,634
>> 'Cause I remember, you know,

736
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,635
last night, you're, like, uh,

737
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,636
"Somebody's... feels like the

738
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,596
jury's going to like them more,

739
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,597
you got to get rid of them.

740
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,598
Somebody's a threat, you got

741
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,599
to get rid of them."

742
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,600
>> I was completely talking

743
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,601
about Brett the whole time in my

744
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,602
mind.

745
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,603
>> Okay.

746
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,604
>> It doesn't make any sense

747
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,897
for me not to get rid of Brett.

748
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,898
>> Day one, I was voted the

749
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,650
leader of, uh, Foa Foa, but I

750
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,734
think it's developed now to

751
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,194
where Russell is definitely, you

752
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,112
know, the leader of us

753
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,530
strategically, for sure.

754
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,531
I got to be thinking, he's a

755
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,532
game player.

756
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,533
He plays hard.

757
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,534
Maybe he's thinking of taking

758
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,870
other people to the jury, um,

759
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,204
with him so that he has a better

760
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:16,830
shot.

761
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,831
I'm not going to be caught off

762
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,832
guard.

763
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,125
That's the only thing.

764
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,126
>> Right.

765
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,127
>>> And I mean, I got to

766
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,128
wonder...

767
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,129
>> It makes me nervous thinking

768
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,130
you're nervous, to tell you the

769
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,131
truth.

770
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,383
Mick is freaking out, and when

771
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,593
you freak out that much, you'll

772
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,552
flip.

773
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,596
That worries me that he's going

774
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,097
to send me home, 'cause that's

775
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,142
what I would do.

776
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:47,861
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

777
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:48,987
You guys ready for another

778
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,654
immunity challenge?

779
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,655
>> Let's make it happen.

780
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,656
>> PROBST: First things first,

781
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,657
Jaison.

782
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,700
You know I'm taking it.

783
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,745
>> Yup.

784
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,917
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

785
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,710
is back up for grabs.

786
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,378
For today's challenge, you must

787
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,047
race out into the water,

788
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,756
retrieve one of your three bags

789
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,883
and race back.

790
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,634
You must then use a plank to

791
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,719
launch your bag into your

792
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,137
basket.

793
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:14,763
First person to get all three

794
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,723
bags in their basket wins

795
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,767
immunity, is safe tonight at

796
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,228
Tribal Council and guaranteed a

797
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,646
one in six shot at a million

798
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,605
dollars.

799
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,148
You guys ready to get to it?

800
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,107
>> Yup.

801
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,108
>> Let's do it.

802
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,109
>> PROBST: All right, we'll

803
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,402
draw for spots, and we'll get

804
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,572
started.

805
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,658
Here we go.

806
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,576
For immunity.

807
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,996
Survivors ready?

808
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,916
Go!

809
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,668
Retrieving one bag at a time,

810
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,337
then racing back.

811
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,713
Jaison untying those knots.

812
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,717
Jaison has his first bag.

813
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,886
Mick has his first bag.

814
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,805
Brett right behind.

815
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,225
Russell's heading back.

816
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,435
Monica has a bag.

817
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,646
Shambo, Natalie bringing up the

818
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,773
rear.

819
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,484
You got to hop on that plank to

820
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,529
get your bag in the basket.

821
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,992
33 days.

822
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,743
Clearly evident.

823
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,079
Natalie really struggling.

824
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,163
Struggling just to keep her

825
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,498
clothes on.

826
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,709
Lost a lot of weight out here.

827
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,710
Keep digging.

828
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,711
Let's go.

829
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,671
You've been out here 33 days.

830
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,840
Don't stop now.

831
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,133
Brett gets his first bag in the

832
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,426
basket.

833
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,593
Brett heading back out on the

834
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,762
course.

835
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,639
Mick has his first bag in the

836
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,724
basket.

837
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,475
Mick heading back out.

838
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,727
Mick gaining some ground on

839
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,813
Brett now.

840
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,815
Russell has his first bag in

841
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,191
the basket.

842
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,777
Russell now out on the course.

843
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,737
Shambo gets her first bag in

844
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,656
the basket.

845
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,576
Brett, Mick, Russell, all with

846
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,495
their second bags.

847
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,831
Jaison, Monica, Natalie-- still

848
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:09,294
no luck with their first bags.

849
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:13,548
Brett back with his second bag.

850
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:17,761
Mick right on his heels.

851
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,804
Brett connects.

852
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,139
He's heading out for his third

853
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,516
and final bag.

854
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,268
Mick right behind.

855
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,270
It is Brett and Mick heading

856
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,522
out for their final bags.

857
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,607
Russell back with his second

858
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,192
bag.

859
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,777
>> In!

860
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,986
>> PROBST: Jaison has his first

861
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,406
bag in the basket.

862
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,949
Russell has his second bag in

863
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,327
the basket.

864
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:42,786
Natalie's now out.

865
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,829
Monica the only one left who has

866
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,458
not got a bag in her basket.

867
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,293
It is coming down to Brett and

868
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,128
Mick, both coming back with

869
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:52,712
their final bags.

870
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,507
Brett kicking it into high gear

871
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,508
now.

872
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,218
He's sprinting back.

873
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,845
Mick, you better dig.

874
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,140
Brett back with his final bag.

875
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,768
Brett can win it.

876
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,769
Mick for the win.

877
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,229
You don't want to go home

878
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:09,813
tonight.

879
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:15,151
Mick, just short.

880
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,196
Brett wins individual immunity!

881
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:23,910
Brett, come on over.

882
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,911
>> Good job, Brett.

883
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,372
>> Good job, B.

884
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,792
>> PROBST: After 33 days, Brett

885
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,377
does not have to worry about

886
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,919
going home tonight.

887
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,506
Mick, Russell, Natalie, Shambo,

888
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,842
Monica, Jaison, one of the six

889
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,427
of you will go home.

890
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,471
I'll see you at Tribal tonight.

891
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,806
>> Brett has shown that he's

892
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,474
got new life, and if he wins

893
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,268
enough immunity challenges, he

894
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,561
could put a wrench in our

895
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,562
entire game plan.

896
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,855
Now we got to get Monica, which

897
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,772
is fine, but this could be a

898
00:28:52,856 --> 00:29:12,917
problem.

899
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,918
>> Thank you, my friend.

900
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,880
>> Baby boy, busts out a move!

901
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,465
>> Brett! Brett!

902
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,674
>> Well, finally got my time.

903
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:20,675
>> Brett, good job.

904
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:21,801
>> You didn't want to go home

905
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,220
today, did you?

906
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,430
>> I was so pissed.

907
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,055
I just couldn't get the freaking

908
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,934
thing in the basket.

909
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,396
>> I know.

910
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,397
>> We don't even got to say a

911
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,398
name.

912
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,399
We know what's up-- Monica.

913
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,400
>> Yeah.

914
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,401
>> It's done.

915
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,027
>> Today, Brett won immunity,

916
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,529
and it totally sucks for me.

917
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,031
At this point, it puts me in a

918
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,450
bad situation where I seem like

919
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,826
the next viable option to go

920
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,870
home, but I'm going to do

921
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,246
everything in my power to make

922
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,291
sure that that doesn't happen.

923
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,586
>> Just wondering how

924
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,962
comfortable you feel making it

925
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:58,838
to the final three, 'cause I was

926
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,341
thinking, if I was in your

927
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,800
shoes, I would get worried a

928
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,801
little bit.

929
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,802
>> Mm-hmm.

930
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,803
>> You know, you are a very

931
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,804
likable person, and that, you

932
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,347
know, obviously, can be a

933
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,848
threat, you know...

934
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,849
>> Yeah.

935
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,850
>> ...when it comes down to the

936
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,311
jury.

937
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,108
>> Right.

938
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,151
>> See, I don't know if you've

939
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,361
even thought about that.

940
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,362
>> Are you kidding me?

941
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,072
I've thought about it a ton.

942
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,742
It's like, a little kid sees a

943
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,160
snake, and the snake's, like,

944
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,161
"Hey, come play with me.

945
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,162
I'm not going to bite you."

946
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,163
And the kid starts playing with

947
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,164
the snake, and the snake bites

948
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,165
him, and he's, like, "What

949
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,166
happened? You said you weren't

950
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,167
going to bite me."

951
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,168
He's, like, "I'm a snake.

952
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,169
That's what I do."

953
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,170
>> Hmm.

954
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,548
>> So, I am very skeptical.

955
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,800
There is definitely a part of

956
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,343
me that wants to make a big move

957
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,886
and definitely thought about

958
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,305
the possibility of getting rid

959
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,307
of Russell.

960
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,392
There are emotional and moral

961
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,935
attachments to people, but I

962
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,355
mean, every night I sit there,

963
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,065
and I visualize in my head my

964
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,108
name with one million dollars

965
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,485
written in front of it.

966
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,528
So, I mean, it's tough.

967
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,113
>> If you want to, you know,

968
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,074
make a big move and, you know,

969
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,492
blindside someone that might

970
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,118
want to take you out, you have

971
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:26,759
the opportunity to do so.

972
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,760
>> He's a player, man.

973
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,053
I mean, it would make more sense

974
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,598
for him to take, like, Natalie

975
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:37,020
and Shambo.

976
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,646
>> I just don't want to be off

977
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,732
guard and not worry about

978
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,444
things, you know.

979
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,162
>> I'm just telling you.

980
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,163
I mean, you need to...

981
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,164
(Russell mumbles)

982
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,165
>> ...put people on your jury

983
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,750
that are going to vote for you.

984
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,543
>> My position is the best in

985
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,002
this game right now.

986
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:01,961
>> Yeah.

987
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:02,962
>> So why would I jeopardize

988
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:03,963
that...?

989
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,964
>> Well, I think you are

990
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,007
jeopardizing your game by taking

991
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,008
people like Jaison who's just

992
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,009
counting down the days to day

993
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,010
36, when it's your final day to

994
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,011
play the idol.

995
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,012
>> How do you think that?

996
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,013
>> He told me so, but I'm

997
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,014
telling you right now that I

998
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:17,894
did not sit in that...

999
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,064
>> He told me it on the beach.

1000
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,398
He said, "Well, he can only play

1001
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,399
that idol until day 36."

1002
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,859
So, I mean, these are the

1003
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:25,443
people you have in your court.

1004
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,528
I'm surprised you want to put

1005
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,529
<i>me</i> on the jury.

1006
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,530
>> Yeah.

1007
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,698
>> I can make or break you on

1008
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,742
the jury, really.

1009
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:54,055
>> Because, uh...

1010
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,056
>> You told her I made a lot of

1011
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,057
money?

1012
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,058
Why would you do something

1013
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,433
stupid like that?

1014
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,518
>> I did not... I didn't do

1015
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,519
that.

1016
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,520
>> Who told her?

1017
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,521
>> Someone else told her.

1018
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,815
I never told her what you did.

1019
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,194
>> How do I know?

1020
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,195
>> Yeah.

1021
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,738
How come all of a sudden Monica

1022
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,156
thinks I make a lot of money for

1023
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,117
some reason?

1024
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,371
>> Uh, Jaison?

1025
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,214
>> She told me what I do for a

1026
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,215
living.

1027
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,342
I want to know what happened.

1028
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,885
You know, did you tell her that

1029
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,429
you would get rid of me after I

1030
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,471
get rid of the idol?

1031
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,472
>> No.

1032
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,640
>> Why would she tell me that?

1033
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,391
>> Because she's trying to stay

1034
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,893
in the game.

1035
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,396
Russell was so angry.

1036
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,064
I might have made a mistake and

1037
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,607
told her what he does for a

1038
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,608
living.

1039
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,068
I honestly don't remember, but

1040
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,404
now I'm nervous that Russell is

1041
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,907
going to come after me, so we've

1042
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,202
got to nip this in the bud soon.

1043
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,495
We got to start thinking about,

1044
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,413
you know, Russell is Russell, so

1045
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,706
we got to, we got to watch out

1046
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:08,171
because...

1047
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,214
>> Oh, my word.

1048
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,632
>> The three of us-- myself,

1049
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,967
Mick, and Natalie-- we got to

1050
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,094
make a tough decision tonight.

1051
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,180
>> It just makes me mad and I

1052
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,181
like it.

1053
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,307
>> You like being pissed off?

1054
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,434
>> Hell, yes.

1055
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,187
Making me mad fuels my fire.

1056
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,606
Monica, she had to run her

1057
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,231
little piehole.

1058
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,734
The little bitch needs to be

1059
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,445
sent home tonight, but now I've

1060
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,031
got to worry about Jaison, so at

1061
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,699
Tribal Council, if I'm feeling

1062
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,117
any kind of heat, I have the

1063
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,410
immunity idol.

1064
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,662
I'm gonna walk in there and if I

1065
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,997
feel any kind of threat

1066
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,457
whatsoever, I'll stand up and

1067
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,709
play it.

1068
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,180
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1069
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,850
the members of our jury.

1070
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:10,358
Erik, Kelly, Laura, John, and

1071
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,692
Dave, voted out at the last

1072
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,362
Tribal Council.

1073
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,247
What's going on, Russell?

1074
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,374
>> I just found a little pretty

1075
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,625
necklace.

1076
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,168
Thought I'd wear it, make me

1077
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,253
look a little better out here.

1078
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,295
>> PROBST: Shambo, is that a

1079
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,840
surprise to you?

1080
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,007
>> Everything he does is a

1081
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,509
surprise.

1082
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,261
>> PROBST: Anybody else shocked

1083
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,846
by Russell putting on what

1084
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,888
appears to be the hidden

1085
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,014
immunity idol?

1086
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,474
>> Absolutely not.

1087
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,517
I think Russell's getting a

1088
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,602
little cocky up in here.

1089
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,312
>> You see, some people think

1090
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,690
that this right here puts a

1091
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,275
target on my back.

1092
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,527
I beg to differ about that.

1093
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,279
I think it puts a target on

1094
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,989
somebody else's back.

1095
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:58,990
>> He's humble.

1096
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,991
(Monica laughs)

1097
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,076
>> PROBST: He does have safety

1098
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,828
around his neck if he chooses to

1099
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,121
use it.

1100
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,122
>> Nobody really knows what

1101
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:06,622
you're gonna do with it.

1102
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,415
That's what makes it so

1103
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,709
powerful.

1104
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,294
>> PROBST: Brett, things have

1105
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,379
really changed, haven't they?

1106
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,881
>> Yeah, I would say that, you

1107
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,507
know, by his gestures, he feels

1108
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,217
pretty comfortable, and as of

1109
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,218
right now, they do have the

1110
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,470
numbers, but when you get

1111
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,805
comfortable in this game, things

1112
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,682
can come and haunt you, so you

1113
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,809
got to stay humble in this game.

1114
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,060
>> PROBST: Shambo, what was it

1115
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:28,519
like at camp after the

1116
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,437
challenge?

1117
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,732
>> It was probably the worst day

1118
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,274
that we have had prior to a

1119
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,275
Tribal.

1120
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,902
>> PROBST: Wow.

1121
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,361
>> Russell got his feathers

1122
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,446
ruffled, and it was just...

1123
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,447
It was...

1124
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,448
>> Awesome.

1125
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,033
>> It was not pretty.

1126
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,284
It was ugly.

1127
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,285
>> PROBST: Russell?

1128
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,953
>> Monica tells me, "If you vote

1129
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:46,495
me out, I ain't putting your

1130
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,413
name down for the million

1131
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,457
dollars, and I'm gonna talk to

1132
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,416
everybody else; they ain't

1133
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,375
putting your name down."

1134
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,376
Well, you know what?

1135
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,753
You're only making me vote you

1136
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,296
out now because of what you

1137
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,297
said.

1138
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,257
>> You know, Russell came into

1139
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,300
the merge and basically tried to

1140
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,719
push a lot of buttons, and I

1141
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,386
haven't seen Russell's buttons

1142
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,263
pushed, but today he was huffing

1143
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,807
and puffing all over camp.

1144
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,601
"Did you say this about me?"

1145
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,187
I mean, he was fuming,<i> fuming.</i>

1146
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,064
>> PROBST: And what about that

1147
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,440
delights you so much?

1148
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,942
>> Basically, I couldn't help

1149
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:16,484
but have a sense of pride,

1150
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,694
knowing that if I put a

1151
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,445
scintilla of doubt in their

1152
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,239
minds of trust, then I

1153
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,324
accomplished my mission.

1154
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,867
>> PROBST: Russell, a little bit

1155
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,619
of teacher-student.

1156
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,496
You taught her so well, she

1157
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,830
graduated and said, "How about

1158
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,957
this?"

1159
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,999
>> Seeing what I've seen today,

1160
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,250
if I would have been on her

1161
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,919
tribe in the beginning, we would

1162
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,879
have been dangerous for sure.

1163
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,881
You know, she got me pissed off,

1164
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,507
so if she would have played that

1165
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,968
hard this entire game, she would

1166
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:42,593
be the one in charge right now.

1167
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,427
>> Or I could be going home

1168
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,428
earlier.

1169
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,346
>> But I've been playing hard

1170
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,306
this entire game and I am still

1171
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,391
here.

1172
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,017
>> Because of idols.

1173
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,185
>> Yeah, well, that's playing

1174
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,186
hard.

1175
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,562
>> PROBST: Russell, a little

1176
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,480
concerned that Monica could have

1177
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,649
stirred up something that points

1178
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,525
fingers now at you?

1179
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,443
>> Not at all.

1180
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,361
I know that everything is fine,

1181
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,655
and that might be my mistake in

1182
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,574
the game, but I don't think so.

1183
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,659
>> PROBST: Mick, when Monica's

1184
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,952
over there stirring it up, you

1185
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,036
have to be going, "This is not

1186
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,037
good."

1187
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,206
>> Yeah, of course, absolutely,

1188
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,582
and we're not that shortsighted

1189
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,333
to say we're all four going to

1190
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,336
win a million bucks, so your

1191
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,379
wheels start spinning a little

1192
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,380
bit.

1193
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,464
I mean, all of a sudden, I'm

1194
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,716
here in front of the jury with

1195
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,092
so-and-so versus so-and-so.

1196
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:23,676
You got to think about stuff

1197
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,302
like that.

1198
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,971
If you're not, then you're

1199
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,597
stupid.

1200
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,683
>> PROBST: Well, it sounds like

1201
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,309
it was an interesting afternoon,

1202
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,352
and the big question seems to

1203
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:33,978
be: did Monica's scrambling pay

1204
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:34,353
off?

1205
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,063
Brett, you have the immunity

1206
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,064
necklace.

1207
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:37,982
I know you're not giving that

1208
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:38,983
up.

1209
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,067
>> I think I'm gonna hold on to

1210
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,068
it.

1211
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,777
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1212
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,778
Brett.

1213
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,404
Everybody else is fair game.

1214
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,447
It's time to vote.

1215
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,034
Brett, you're up.

1216
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,423
>> Stupid, stupid little girl.

1217
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,260
Bad strategy.

1218
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,525
>> Watch out 'cause you have a

1219
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,528
huge target on your back.

1220
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,407
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1221
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,701
votes.

1222
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,463
If anybody has the hidden

1223
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,756
immunity idol and you want to

1224
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,466
play it, now would be the time

1225
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,260
to do so.

1226
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,186
Okay.

1227
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:57,770
Once the votes are read, the

1228
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,396
decision is final.

1229
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,356
Person voted out will be asked

1230
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:00,981
to leave the Tribal Council area

1231
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,608
immediately.

1232
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:07,571
I'll read the votes.

1233
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,656
First vote.

1234
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,450
Monica.

1235
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,451
Russell.

1236
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,328
One vote-- Monica, one vote--

1237
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,704
Russell.

1238
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,417
Monica.

1239
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,001
Two votes-- Monica, one vote--

1240
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,631
Russell.

1241
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,632
Russell.

1242
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:26,924
We're tied.

1243
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:27,550
Two votes-- Monica, two votes--

1244
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,593
Russell.

1245
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,684
Monica.

1246
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,185
That's three votes-- Monica, two

1247
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,604
votes-- Russell.

1248
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,527
12th person voted out and the

1249
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,654
sixth member of our jury--

1250
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:49,655
Monica.

1251
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,739
That's four, that's enough.

1252
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,783
You need to bring me your torch.

1253
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,669
Monica, the tribe has spoken.

1254
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,558
Well, there are six of you left

1255
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,684
in this game now.

1256
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,977
Not everybody's going to make it

1257
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,395
to the final, so while it may

1258
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:22,646
not have worked for Monica

1259
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,356
tonight, going to be a lot more

1260
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,357
scrambling to come.

1261
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:25,983
Grab your torches, head back to

1262
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:26,650
camp.

1263
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,652
Good night.

1264
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,707
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1265
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,459
from our next episode.

1266
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,630
>> PROBST: Next time on

1267
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,631
<i>Survivor.</i>

1268
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,465
>> I'm in!

1269
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,174
>> Maybe something is going on

1270
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,134
with Mick, Natalie, and Brett.

1271
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,178
I have to blindside everybody.

1272
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,179
>> PROBST: With only two

1273
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,555
episodes left, the alliances are

1274
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,556
shifting.

1275
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,432
>> This is the team.

1276
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:00,434
Me, Jaison-- we are running the

1277
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,644
show.

1278
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,645
>> There's a chance that

1279
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,646
Russell's lying to me and it

1280
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,773
scares the hell out of me.

1281
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,654
>> I am shocked.

1282
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,780
I mean, 33 days, and I feel

1283
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,781
amazing.

1284
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,866
I think I made it really far in

1285
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,369
this game, and I definitely went

1286
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,704
out causing some conflict in the

1287
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,164
Foa Foas.

1288
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:22,790
I think they all distrust each

1289
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,959
other a little bit more, and I'm

1290
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,502
proud to say that I caused that

1291
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,086
and that I stirred the pot a

1292
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,629
little bit, even if it was on my

1293
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,673
way out.
