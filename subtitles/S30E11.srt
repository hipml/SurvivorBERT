1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,960
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,963
"SURVIVOR"...

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:05,422
>> WE GOT THE NUMBERS.

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:05,672
>> YEAH.

5
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:06,339
>> WE MAKE A MOVE.

6
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,590
>> Jeff: RODNEY WAS PUTTING

7
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,300
TOGETHER A STRONG ALLIANCE.

8
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,261
>> I'M ALWAYS RIDING WITH

9
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,137
NUMBERS, BABY.

10
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,596
LOOKING BEAUTIFUL FOR RODNEY,

11
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,597
ISN'T IT.

12
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,807
>> Jeff: BUT BEING IN CHARGE

13
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,307
DOESN'T ALWAYS LEAD THE

14
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:16,599
HAPPINESS.

15
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,143
>> EVERYBODY'S HAD A BREAK, BUT

16
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,020
I'VE LISTEN LOCKED IN MY CELL

17
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:21,354
24/7.

18
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,439
I'M PISSED.

19
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,023
>> Jeff: TYLER AND CAROLYN

20
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,275
DISCOVERED THE PARTY OF DAN'S

21
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:25,567
ADVANTAGE.

22
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,444
>> I GRABBED DAN'S BAG.

23
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,528
HE GETS AN EXTRA VOTE.

24
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,072
>> WOW.

25
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,867
>> Jeff: AFTER EXPOSING

26
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,368
RODNEY'S SECRET ALLIANCE.

27
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,663
>> IT'S A GREAT JOB YOU ALL

28
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,080
FLIPPED RODNEY...

29
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,248
>> EVERYONE WAS TARGETING MIKE.

30
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,917
>> WE GET HIM OUT RIGHT NOW,

31
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:43,293
HE'LL NEVER KNOW.

32
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,754
>> I KNOW THEY ARE COMING FOR MY

33
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,045
HEAD.

34
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,172
>> Jeff: BUT HE WAS

35
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,423
UNSTOPPABLE AT IMMUNITY

36
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,258
CHALLENGES.

37
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:50,592
RODNEY IS OUT.

38
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,302
MIKE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

39
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,472
FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A ROW.

40
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,806
AND AT TRIBAL COUNCIL...

41
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,099
>> I'M PULLING OUT A HIDDEN

42
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,352
IMMUNITY IDOL, JEFF.

43
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,146
>> Jeff: HE REVEALED HIS IDOL

44
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,857
TO SHAKE UP THE SIX.

45
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,275
>> SHIRIN'S VOTING FOR TYLER.

46
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,069
I'M VOTING FOR ONE OF THE OTHER

47
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,822
FOUR, AND YOU TAKE YOUR CHANCES.

48
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,364
>> Jeff: AND ALTHOUGH TYLER

49
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,617
AND WILL CHANGED THEIR VOTE.

50
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,619
>> 11th PERSON VOTED OUT,

51
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,706
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

52
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:21,956
SHIRIN.

53
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,250
SHIRIN WAS SENT HOME.

54
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,211
SHIRIN, THE TRIBE HAD SPOKEN.

55
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,921
SEVEN ARE LEFT.

56
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:40,225
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

57
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,268
>> I THINK DAN VOTED FOR TYLER

58
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,144
AND TYLER VOTED FOR DAN.

59
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,687
>> I BET YOU ARE WRONG.

60
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,939
I PUT A STAR ON MINE.

61
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,858
I VOTED FOR SHIRIN.

62
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,026
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

63
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,319
I VOTED FOR SHIRIN, TOO.

64
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,696
>> LET'S NOT DO THIS.

65
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,323
LET'S NO DO THIS.

66
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,074
STAY FOCUSED.

67
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,408
>> I'M JUST LETTING...

68
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,785
>> YOU AIN'T GOT TO.

69
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,495
YOU HEAR ME?

70
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,955
YOU HEAR ME?

71
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,998
>> ONE OF YOU IS GOING HOME NEXT

72
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,459
TIME, SO BETTER START

73
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,252
SCRAMBLING.

74
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,170
>> WHEN WE GOT BACK TO CAMP

75
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,005
AFTER TRIBAL, THEY CALLED A

76
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,549
LITTLE TEAM MEETING OF THE SIX.

77
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,259
AND IT WAS KIND OF FUN.

78
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,178
IT WAS KIND OF FUN TO START

79
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,555
WATCHING PEOPLE SCRAMBLE BECAUSE

80
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,517
FOR THE PAST THREE VOTES, I'VE

81
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,229
BEEN SCRAMBLING.

82
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,314
RIGHT NOW I'M SAFE WITH MY

83
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,567
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

84
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,278
SO THAT TARGET IS TAKEN OFF OF

85
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,488
ME AND THEY'LL START TURNING ON

86
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:35,989
EACH OTHER.

87
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,490
THE FALL OUT OF ALL THIS WILL BE

88
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,491
INTERESTING TO WATCH, AND THAT'S

89
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,328
FOR SURE.

90
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,913
>> I HAVE TO WRITE SOMEBODY'S

91
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,373
NAME DOWN OTHER THAN MINE.

92
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,624
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

93
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,669
>> I CAN'T WRITE SHIRIN.

94
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,253
>> YES, YOU COULD HAVE.

95
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,423
I KNEW IT WAS A BLUFF.

96
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,257
>> BUT WHEN YOUR NAME IS THE

97
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,217
OTHER ONE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

98
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,928
OUT THERE, I HAVE TO WRITE

99
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,221
SOMEBODY ELSE'S OUT THERE.

100
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,973
IF I DON'T, I'M DONE.

101
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,850
I PUT DOWN DAN'S NAME THINKING,

102
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,475
LOOK, MAN, I HAVE TO DO WHATEVER

103
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,393
I CAN TO STAY ALIVE.

104
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,312
>> WHO IS THE ONLY OTHER NAME I

105
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,438
CAN THINK OF THAT'S GOING TO BE

106
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,774
ON THE BLOCK?

107
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,567
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

108
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,735
>> NOTHING HAPPENED.

109
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:21,409
IT'S FINE.

110
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:27,457
>> I DIDN'T WRITE YOUR -- I

111
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,918
WROTE YOUR NAME DOWN.

112
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,961
>> OKAY.

113
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,503
I'M JUST COMING TO YOU AND

114
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:32,921
TELLING YOU THAT.

115
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,883
>> THANK YOU.

116
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,843
>> THE FACT THAT I GOT TWO VOTES

117
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,929
GIVES ME REASON FOR PAUSE.

118
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,431
SO THAT'S BAD ON WILL AND TYLER,

119
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,309
BECAUSE THEY DID FLINCH.

120
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,853
MIKE IS STILL PUBLIC ENEMY

121
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,480
NUMBER ONE RIGHT NOW.

122
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,523
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM: MIKE HAS

123
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,983
AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

124
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,404
HE'S GUARANTEED ONE MORE TRIP.

125
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,449
>> LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TOLD

126
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,158
ME WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

127
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,327
THIS IS A GAME.

128
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:04,619
RIGHT?

129
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,329
YOU AND I ARE GOING FAR.

130
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,541
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

131
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,918
WE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

132
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:12,418
ALL RIGHT?

133
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,380
LAST NIGHT'S VOTE SO THE SIX ARE

134
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,881
MORE THAN WILLING TO VOTE FOR

135
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,758
EACH OTHER AND THAT DAN IS MOST

136
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,051
LIKELY AT THE BOTTOM, WHICH IS

137
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,511
WHY HE GOT VOTES, BUT I WAS ON

138
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,221
THE CHOPPING BLOCK, AS WELL, SO

139
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,389
I DON'T HAVE TOO MANY LIFELINES

140
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:24,681
REMAINING.

141
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,392
I VOTED FOR DAN, AND I PLAN ON

142
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:27,767
DOING IT AGAIN.

143
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,814
I DON'T KNOW IF I CALL DAN

144
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,481
EXTREMELY GULLIBLE.

145
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,274
I JUST CALL HIM EXTREMELY LOYAL,

146
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,484
BUT IN THIS GAME, THEY'RE KIND

147
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:41,948
OF ONE IN THE SAME.

148
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,657
>> TODAY IS DAY 30.

149
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:30,121
>> RODNEY'S BIRTHDAY!

150
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:30,496
>> THANKS, GUYS.

151
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,707
APPRECIATE THAT.

152
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,082
APPRECIATE THAT.

153
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,168
>> TODAY'S MY BIRTHDAY.

154
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,461
HOPEFULLY WE GOT A REWARD.

155
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,504
HOPEFULLY I GET OUT OF HERE.

156
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,797
I'VE BEEN STUCK ON THIS BEACH

157
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,549
FOR 30 DAYS DOING THE SAME DAMN

158
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:49,557
THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

159
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,349
WE GOT TREE MAIL.

160
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:50,767
>> READ IT, GIRL.

161
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,102
>> FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOURISH

162
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,564
YOUR SOUL, JUST RACE THROUGH.

163
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,067
YOU ALSO MAY BE FEEDING YOUR

164
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,069
BELLY IF IT'S YOU WHO CAN

165
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:01,486
DOMINATE THE STUMPS.

166
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,530
>> I NEED THIS PICK-ME-UPPER,

167
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,531
MAN.

168
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,492
>> FEEDING YOUR SOUL?

169
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,702
>> FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOURISH

170
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,788
YOUR SOUL, RACE THROUGH A FEW

171
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,206
LITTLE LUMPS.

172
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,624
YOU ALSO MAY BE FEEDING YOUR

173
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,752
BELLY, IF IT'S YOU WHO CAN

174
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,044
DOMINATE...

175
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,587
>> PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TIGHT

176
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,962
ME AND WILL ARE.

177
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,924
MAMA C, SHE HAS A LOT OF LOVE,

178
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:23,925
TOO, AND THEY'RE GOING THE TAKE

179
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,051
ME ON THIS REWARD.

180
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,511
>> I HAVE FAITH IN MY REWARD

181
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,929
TODAY.

182
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,847
IF I DON'T GO ON THE REWARD, IT

183
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,349
WILL BE A SAD, SAD DAY.

184
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,642
MY WHOLE GAME WILL CHANGE, BUT

185
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,601
GUESS WHAT, THE CHANCES OF THAT

186
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,271
HAPPENING ARE 0.000% CHANCE

187
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:37,897
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH FAITH I

188

381
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,514
>> DAN WITH A FOURTH.

THAT'S FOUR FOR BLUE.

383
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,558
IT WOULD BE A BIG COMEBACK.

384
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,018
>> MIKE, THEY'RE FOUR.

385
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,770
THEY GOT FOUR.

395
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,699
SIERRA WANTS IN.

396
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,786
MIKE WON'T GIVE HER A SHOT.

397
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,122
DAN THE WIN RIGHT HERE.

398
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:10,873

THAT'S GAME!

400
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,713

>> JUST KEEP SHOOTING, BRO.

403
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:24,887

THIS IS THE WORST FEELING EVER.

00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,235
I'M 30 DAYS IN AND I HAVEN'T

00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:23,988
THESE THREE WILL FEEL FOR YOU ON

438
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,030
YOUR SPECIAL DAY AND GIVE UP

THEIR REWARD FOR YOU?

440
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,325
>> IT'S UP TO THEM.

441
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,451
I'M NOT GOING TO PRESSURE THEM

442
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,286
AND PLEAD THE CASE.

443
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,078
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

444
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,538
IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME

445
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:32,830
OPPORTUNITY.

446
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,081
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

TODAY, JEFF, IT IS RODNEY'S

00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,459
BIRTHDAY, AND MY HEART GOES OUT

449
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,211
TO HIM THAT HE HASN'T BEEN ON

SIERRA ANY INTEREST IN GIVING UP

456
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,553
THIS REWARD TO RODNEY.

457
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,097
>> THIS IS ALSO A

458
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,681
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY

00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,226
UP AT THIS POINT.

461
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,603
>> PRETTY SAD.

462
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,229
>> Jeff: WHAT'S SAD, RODNEY?

463
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:57,938
>> I THINK MAYBE WHAT HE'S

464
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,149
TALKING ABOUT IS IF IT WAS AN

465
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,109
INDIVIDUAL, WE WERE GOING TO

466
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,694
PICK RODNEY, RODNEY WAS GOING TO

467
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,863
BE THE FIRST PICK, BUT SINCE IT

468
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,990
BECAME A TEAM, I PERSONALLY DID

469
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,242
NOT SAY I WOULD SEPARATE FROM MY

470
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:10,451
TEAM.

471
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,119
>> BUT SOME PEOPLE MADE COMMENTS

472
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,370
AND SAID SOME THINGS, BUT WHEN

473
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:13,996
YOU GO BACK FROM YOUR WORD, IT

474
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,707
KIND OF... IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, YOU

475
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,042
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

476
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,835
IT'S MY DAMN BIRTHDAY, BUT IT IS

477
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,128
WHAT IT IS?

478
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,004

>> PEOPLE AREN'T YOUR FRIENDS.

487
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,146
THEY SHOW YOU HOW CUTTHROAT THEY

488
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,439

YOUR OWN DAMN BIRTHDAY AND THEY

490
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,525
DON'T TAKE YOU ON REWARD.

491
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,235
THEY JUST TURNED ME INTO THE

492
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,320
PSYCHOTIC PERSON I AM.

NOBODY ELSE AT OUR CAMP THAT I

566
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,165
WOULD WANT THE SHARE THIS WITH

567
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,459
THAN YOU TWO.

568
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:05,709
SERIOUSLY.

569
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,461
>> I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

570
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,212
YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

571
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,213
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN ON A REWARD

572
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,131
WITH MIKE BEFORE, SO I GOT A

573
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,716
CHANCE TO SEE HIM IN A DIFFERENT

574
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:12,925
LIGHT.

575
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,719
>> I LITERALLY FEEL LIKE A KING

576
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,095
RIGHT NOW.

577
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,679
>> MIKE HAS A LOT OF POWER IN

578
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,597
THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.

579
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,474
HE DOES WIN CHALLENGES AND HE

580
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,184
DOES HAVE AN IDOL.

581
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,310
SO HE'S NOT GOING HOME AND WE

582
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,270
HAVE TO VOTE ONE OF THE SIX OUT.

583
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,815
THAT'S WHY I'M WORRIED ABOUT

584
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,733
MYSELF, AND, YEAH, I'M THINKING

585
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,359
ABOUT ALIGNING MYSELF WITH THE

586
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,236
PEOPLE THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO

587
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,697
TAKE ME FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

588
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,159
SO MAYBE IT'S TIME TO JOIN

589
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,077
FORCES.

590
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,161
WHO KNOWS?

591
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:52,673
COULD HAPPEN.

592
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,031
>> WASHING DISHES ON MY

593
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,785
BIRTHDAY.

594
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,622
NO COCONUTS OR ANY FRUIT,

595
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,541
NOTHING, THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

596
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,501
0 FOR 5 ON REWARD CHALLENGES AND

597
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,337
A BUNCH OF SCUMBAGS WHO

598
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,798
NEGLECTED ME ON MY BIRTHDAY WHO

599
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,884
CLAIM TO BE "SURVIVOR" FAMILY.

600
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,176
ALL BETS ARE OFF NOW.

601
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,428
BUNCH OF SCUMBAGS.

602
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:39,636
UNREAL.

603
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,058
CAROLINE AND SIERRA, THEY ABOUT

604
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:45,851
IT GOING TO THE END.

605
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,269
THE ONLY PEOPLE GOING TO THE END

606
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,395
UNDER MY WATCH IS ME.

607
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:56,820
THAT'S IT.

608
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,780
>> JUST LET HIM COOL OFF.

609
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,865
THAT'S RODNEY.

610
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,702
HE'LL COOL OFF.

611
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,164
>> WELL, WE'LL SEE HOW A LOSS

612
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:07,789
COMPLICATES THINGS AROUND HERE

613
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,625
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS FOR

614
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:09,875
RODNEY.

615
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:15,797
>> HERE HE COMES.

616
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,260
>> I'M SORRY, MAN.

617
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,889
>> YOU REALLY BELIEVE MAMA C,

618
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,264
THOUGH.

619
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,557
I KNOW FAR FACT YOU WOULDN'T DO

620
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:25,849
THAT TO ME.

621
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,559
YOU COULD HAVE INDIVIDUALLY TOOK

622
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,102
YOURSELF OUT, LIKE I KNOW YOU

623
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:29,478
GUYS WOULD HAVE.

624
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,438
I'M REALLY PISSED AT MAMA C,

625
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,648
THOUGH.

626
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,399
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

627
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,526
[BLEEPED] ME OVER LIKE THAT.

628
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,029
SEE SIGH I KNOW SHE WOULD, BUT

629
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:42,157
MAMA C, HER FOURTH REWARD.

630
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,825
THIS IS WHAT IS "SURVIVOR'S"

631
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,117
ABOUT, BABY.

632
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,994
I WENT ON EVERY SINGLE REWARD.

633
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,788
>> I UNDERSTAND HIM BEING HURT.

634
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,498
I UNDERSTAND HIM BEING UPSET.

635
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,918
BUT EVEN IN MY OPINION, THAT WAS

636
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,252
A BIT MUCH.

637
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:58,340
>> HEY, LISTEN, THIS IS GOING TO

638
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,716
SET UP REALLY NICE.

639
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,385
ONE THING I LEARN IS MY TEMP

640
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,469
KERR GET ME IN TROUBLE OR SET ME

641
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,887
FORWARD.

642
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,639
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE ULTIMATE

643
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,348
BLIND SIDE EVER.

644
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,934
I'M GOING TO TELL THAT I'M

645
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:09,851
CHECKED OUT.

646
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,311
I WANT TO BE VOTED OUT I WANT TO

647
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,688
BE ON THE JURY NEXT.

648
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,314
MIKE'S NOT GOING TO PLAY HIS

649
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,399
IDOL AND WE GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

650
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,526
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

651
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,068
PRETTY DAMN SMART.

652
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,778
>> I DO NOT THINK FOR A SECOND

653
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,988
THAT IT'S GOING TO WORK.

654
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,907
>> I REALLY THINK RODNEY IS

655
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,534
SLIPPING OFF INTO THE ABYSS.

656
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,827
AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME,

657
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,997
YOU KNOW, LET HIM HAVE HIS

658
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,499
MOMENT OF EXPLOSION.

659
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,625
HOPEFULLY HE'S ON THE CHOPPING

660
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,210
BLOCK, AND THEY WON'T SEE ME AS

661
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,420
A TARGET.

662
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,088
WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT.

663
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,339
>> THIS WHOLE SHOW ABOUT RODNEY

664
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,341
WANTING TO QUIT AND THIS AND

665
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,592
THAT COULD BE A LITTLE IFFY.

666
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,386
>> I'M TELLING YOU, MIKE'S GOING

667
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:44,761
HOME.

668
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,429
MIKE IS GOING HOME.

669
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,347
>> WE SAT AROUND AND ESSENTIALLY

670
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,390
WATCHED RODNEY STORM AROUND,

671
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,393
KICK THE DIRT, CURSE, SPIT,

672
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:51,685
FIGHT.

673
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,019
HE'S LOST IT.

674
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,687
HE'S GOING CRAZY.

675
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,397
WHICH IS SCARY.

676
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,274
BECAUSE RODNEY IS IN MY

677
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,525
ALLIANCE, AND I CERTAINLY CAN'T

678
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,277
RELY ON HIM, AND MIKE MOST

679
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,528
LIKELY WILL PLAY HIS IDOL.

680
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,488
>> WHAT IF MIKE PLAYS THE IDOL

681
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,698
AND VOTES ME AND I'M GONE.

682
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,116
>> I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO

683
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,076
PLAY THE IDOL.

684
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,537
WHY WOULD HE PLAY IT IF I'M

685
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,329
ACTING SO GOOD?

686
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,581
>> BECAUSE IT'S "SURVIVOR."

687
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO ANTICIPATE CRAZY.

688
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,835
>> BUT HOW CRAZY IS THAT,

689
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,085
THOUGH?

690
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:17,419
>> IT IS CRAZY.

691
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,420
>> IT WOULD BE STUPID FOR MIKE

692
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,464
TO BUY THE STORY, AND I'M THE

693
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,591
FIRST ONE THAT MIKE WANTS GONE.

694
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,676
I'M GOING TO BE THE ONE HE VOTES

695
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,302
FOR.

696
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,428
IF WE JUST LEAVE IT INTO MIKE'S

697
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,138
HANDS.

698
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,222
I'M OUT OF HERE.

699
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,574
>> THE BEST TIME OF YOUR LIFE ON

700
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,200
MY BIRTHDAY WHEN SOMEBODY COULD

701
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,328
HAVE STEPPED UP AND LET ME GO.

702
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,038
I'M SAYING I WANT THEM TO VOTE

703
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,998
ME OUT AT TRIBAL AND I'VE HAD

704
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:55,624
ENOUGH.

705
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,667
HOPEFULLY MIKE DOESN'T PLAY HIS

706
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:57,876
IDOL.

707
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,961
>> I WISH TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS

708
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,171
TODAY SO YOU COULD PUT MY NAME

709
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:01,379
DOWN.

710
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:01,713
OKAY.

711
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:01,963
HAVE FUN.

712
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,258
HAVE FUN WITH YOUR LITTLE GAME.

713
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,426
A BUNCH OF FAKE-ASS PEOPLE AND

714
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,844
I'M DONE.

715
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,181
I NEED TO GET HOME TO MY FAMILY.

716
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,766
MAMA C, SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE

717
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,600
LIKE A MOTHER.

718
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,559
YOU'RE LIKE A SON TO ME?

719
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,479
THAT'S LIKE YOU LEAVE YOUR SON

720
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,272
HOME AND GO OUT PARTYING AND

721
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,524
LEAVE YOUR SON AT HOME DOING

722
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,192
CHORES WHEN YOU WERE OUT ON MY

723
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,485
BIRTHDAY.

724
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:23,819
IT'S ALL FAKE.

725
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,240
>> WHY SHOULD THEY GIVE UP THEIR

726
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,407
REWARD WHEN YOU LOST THE

727
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:29,658
CHALLENGE?

728
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,785
>> IF IT WAS ANY OTHER DAY.

729
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,161
>> IT'S ANOTHER DAY.

730
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,996
IF I HAVE TO HEAR THAT...

731
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,123
>> ALL RIGHT.

732
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:36,665
YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR IT.

733
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,669
YOU WRITE MY DAMN NAME DOWN.

734
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,586
>> WHY QUIT NOW?

735
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,757
>> I'M NOT WRITING YOUR NAME.

736
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,425
IT TOTALLY MAKES MORE SENSE.

737
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,220
>> I SEE RIGHT THROUGH THE

738
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:50,428
PLANE.

739
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,180
FEEL LIKE I'M SAFE SO I DON'T

740
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,306
PLAY MY IDOL.

741
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,558
THAT AIN'T HAPPENING, BROTHER.

742
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,309
I'M IN THE AN IDIOT, JUST

743
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,563
BECAUSE I TALK SLOW DON'T MEAN I

744
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,021
THINK SLOW.

745
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:00,605
>> WRITE MY DAMN NAME DOWN.

746
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,566
>> GO HOME.

747
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,778
>> MIKE DIDN'T BY THE ACT FOR A

748
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,404
SECOND.

749
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:07,863
HE JUST STOPPED THAT

750
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,364
CONVERSATION.

751
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,533
MIKE HAS HIS IMMUNITY IDOL AND

752
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:17,581
WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

753
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,000
>> LAY IT ON ME.

754
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,418
YOU THINK MIKE'S GOING TO VOTE

755
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,085
FOR ME NEXT TIME.

756
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,587
>> HE'S EITHER GOING TO VOTE FOR

757
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,880
YOU OR DAN.

758
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,714
>> IF I DON'T WIN IMMUNITY.

759
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,716

760
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,550
>> RIGHT.

761
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,719
>> I NEED THE START THINKING

762
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,430
ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS, AS

763
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:33,763
WELL.

764
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,766
WHAT ABOUT YOUR...

765
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,436
>> WE WOULD USE IT WHEN WE NEED

766
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:39,603
IT.

767
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,228
>> OKAY.

768
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,189
>> WOULD CAROLYN BE WILLING TO

769
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,648
PUT DOWN THE WHITE COLLAR IDOL

770
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:43,940
TO SAVE ME?

771
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,318
I HOPE SO.

772
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,195
MY TRUST IS IN MAMA C.

773
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,696
I'M ALSO HER CLOSEST ALLIANCE

774
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,572
MEMBER.

775
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,490
AND IF THINGS GET DOWN TO THE

776
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,074
WIRE, YOU HAVE TO TRUST PEOPLE

777
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,784
IN ORDER TO GET FURTHER.

778
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,369
THE POINT IS, YOU NEED TO START

779
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,787
BRINGING YOUR IDOL THE WAY

780
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:58,246
STUFF'S GOING DOWN.

781
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:58,955
>> WELL YEAH,.

782
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,249
>> FROM A STRATEGIC GAME

783
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:01,875
PERSPECTIVE, I'M PLAYING THE

784
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,417
GAME HARD.

785
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,587
I KNOW THAT TYLER TRUSTS ME.

786
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,922
SO I THINK MIKE DOESN'T REALLY

787
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,466
HAVE ANYBODY ELSE TO WORK WITH.

788
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,718
SO I ACTUALLY DO FEEL LIKE I'M

789
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:23,980
THE ONE IN CHARGE RIGHT NOW.

790
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,111

795
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,619
I'LL TAKE BACK BOTH NECKLACES.

796
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,828
SORRY, CAROLYN.

797
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:39,746
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT

798
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,250
UP, BUT YOU MUST.

799
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,586
TODAY WE ONLY NEED ONE NECKLACE.

800
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,671
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

FURTHER DOWN THE ROPE, MAKING IT

808
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,018
MORE DIFFICULT, WHEN YOU CAN'T

809
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,480
HOLD ON ANY LONGER, YOU'LL DROP

810
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,898

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,589
2 BAD NEWS, I GOT TWO VOTES LAST

939
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,675
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND RIGHT NOW

940
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,886
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT MY

941
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,055
ADVANTAGE, WHICH MAKES ME AN

942
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,139
EASY TARGET.

943
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,625
I WON MY SECOND IMMUNITY

944
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,045
CHALLENGE IN A ROW.

945
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:21,296
WOO WOO.

946
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,964
SO EXCITED.

947
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,048
BUT IT'S NOT CUT AND DRY HOW TO

948
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,884
PLAY THIS GAME NOW BECAUSE

949
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:27,927
THERE'S SO MANY OPTIONS.

950
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,470
SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU

951
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:36,352
FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT MOVE.

952
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:41,649
>> GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

953
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,818
>> DOES IT PUT FEAR INTO ME THAT

954
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,903
MY NAME COULD GET WRITTEN DOWN?

955
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:46,696
OF COURSE IT DOES.

956
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,114
I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THREE PEOPLE

957
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,492
ARE GOING HOME TONIGHT, ME, MIKE

958
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,785
OR TYLER.

959
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,037
BUT MIKE'S PROBABLY GOING THE

960
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,456
PLAY HIS IDOL TONIGHT, SO THE

961
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,999
ODDS ARE ON EITHER TYLER OR

962
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,001
MYSELF BECAUSE THEY SEE TYLER AS

963
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,046
A THREAT, AND MY NAME KEEPS

964
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,049
GETTING WRITTEN DOWN.

965
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:11,554
>> GUYS VOTE MIKE, GIRLS VOTE

966
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:16,351
TYLER.

967
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:20,438
MIKE VOTES GETS THREE VOTES.

968
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,189
MIKE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR TYLER.

969
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,233
AS FAR AS DAN'S CONCERNED, WE'RE

970
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,902
GUNNING FOR TYLER, BUT VOTING

971
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,570
FOR DAN IS NOT REALLY A BAD IDEA

972
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,364
BECAUSE WE GET RID OF THE

973
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:35,119
ADVANTAGE.

974
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,413
>> WILL ALSO VOTED FOR ME.

975
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,499
>> NO, NO, NO.

976
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,376
>> JUST SAYING.

977
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,710
>> I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE

978
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,045
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WITH

979
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:44,212
WILL.

980
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,130
>> YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING,

981
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:55,181
THOUGH?

982
00:32:55,264 --> 00:33:01,020
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAN?

983
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,605
>> MIKE'S STILL GOING TO BE

984
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,481
HERE.

985
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:03,856
YOU'LL BE HERE.

986
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,526
>> I WAS THINKING DAN.

987
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,110
DAN'S GOT THIS ADVANTAGE.

988
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,487
>> OKAY.

989
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,947
>> THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE IN

990
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,657
THIS GAME WHO HAVE ADVANTAGES

991
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,325
GOING INTO TONIGHT'S TRIBAL,

992
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,036
MIKE HAS AN IDOL, CAROLYN HAS AN

993
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,996
IDOL AND DAN HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN

994
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,247
VOTING.

995
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,374
I WAS CON DURING IF MAYBE WE...

996
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,875
DAN'S ADVANTAGE MAKES HIM A HUGE

997
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,584
THREAT IN THIS GAME.

998
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,086
>> OH, HELL YEAH.

999
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,629
>> DOWN THE ROAD.

1000
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,423
>> THE LAST TRIBAL I WAS THE ONE

1001
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,757
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

1002
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,717
I COULD BE EASILY GOING HOME

1003
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,259
TONIGHT, SO MY PLAN TONIGHT

1004
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,637
WOULD BE TO THROW FOUR VOTES AT

1005
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,139
MIKE, ANOTHER TWO VOTES GO AFTER

1006
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,099
DAN AND WE KNOCK OUT BOTH AN

1007
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,851
IDOL AND THE ADVANTAGE.

1008
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:45,690
DAN GOES HOME.

1009
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,234
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A

1010
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:52,238
4-3 VOTE, FOUR FOR ME, AND I'M

1011
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,240
VOTING TYLER.

1012
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,660
>> MIKE IS GUNNING FOR TYLER.

1013
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,620
AND THIS COULD BE THE ONLY

1014
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,164
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SIDE WITH

1015
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,248
HIM.

1016
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,125
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE

1017
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,253
RIGHT MOVE TO MAKE RIGHT NOW.

1018
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,088
>> I REALLY, REALLY, HOPE MAMA C

1019
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,924
IS 100% ON BOARD WITH ME RIGHT

1020
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,968
NOW BECAUSE MY OPTIONS OF WHO TO

1021
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,845
WORK WITH AT THIS POINT ARE A

1022
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,972
LITTLE BIT LIMITED.

1023
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,725
>> I TALKED TO WILL.

1024
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,729
HE AND I ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.

1025
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,313
>> DAN.

1026
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,314
>> SO YOU GUYS WILL VOTE MIKE.

1027
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,190
THAT'S FOUR VOTES MIKE.

1028
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,276
HE HAS TO PLAY HIS IDOL.

1029
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,320
HE'LL PLAY IT FOR SURE.

1030
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,197
AND THEN YOU, ME AND WILL VOTE

1031
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,363
DAN.

1032
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,991
>> THAT ADVANTAGE IS GOING TO

1033
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,326
COME BACK THE HAUNT US IF WE

1034
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,410
DON'T GET RID OF IT NOW.

1035
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,247
>> I KNOW.

1036
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,291
>> IT'S A TOSS-UP BETWEEN DAN

1037
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,711
AND TYLER AS TO WHO NEEDS TO GO

1038
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,420
FIRST.

1039
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,797
TYLER AND I HAVE A BOND.

1040
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,339
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE

1041
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,425
LITERALLY DAY THREE, BUT HE'S

1042
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,135
THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS I HAVE AN

1043
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,179
IDOL, SO HE CAN BLOW UP MY GAME.

1044
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,641
BUT DAN'S ADVANTAGE GIVES HIM AN

1045
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:05,228
EXTRA VOTE, SO THAT'S A BIG

1046
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:11,234
THREAT.

1047
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,319
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GAME FOR $1

1048
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,029
MILLION, AND I'M HERE TO PLAY

1049
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,197
THE PLAY THE GAME, SO GAME ON,

1050
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:27,875
BOYS AND GIRLS.

1051
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,174
>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE

1052
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:41,722
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1053
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,391
HALI, JOE, JENN AND SHIRIN VOTED

1054
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:48,187
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1055
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,605
ALL RIGHT.

1056
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,315
SO, MIKE, LAST FEW TRIBALS IT'S

1057
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,484
BEEN A TIGHT PICK.

1058
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,861
I'M GUESSING TONIGHT THEY WOULD

1059
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,237
LOVE TO TAKE OUT YOU, BUT BASED

1060
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,321
ON THE LAST TRIBAL, YOU HAVE

1061
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,448
YOUR HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1062
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,410
>> I BELIEVE I HAVE IT WITH ME

1063
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:02,910
TONIGHT, THAT'S FOR SURE.

1064
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,537
SO ONE OF THE SIX WILL BE GOING

1065
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,247
HOME TONIGHT, THAT'S GUARANTEED.

1066
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,999
>> Jeff: SO WHO SHOULD BE

1067
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:08,541
WORRIED TONIGHT?

1068
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,167
>> I BELIEVE THAT TYLER SHOULD

1069
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:10,710
BE WORRIED.

1070
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,419
I BELIEVE THAT DAN SHOULD BE

1071
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:11,669
WORRIED.

1072
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,379
I MEAN, JEFF, I'M ENJOYING THIS

1073
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,132
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST.

1074
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,300
I'VE BEEN ROOTING FOR PEOPLE TO

1075
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,718
CHANGE SOME THINKING FOR THREE

1076
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,260
TRIBAL COUNCILS NOW.

1077
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,722
I MEAN, I GOT THE FIREWORKS OUT,

1078
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,432
THE POPCORN, SOME PEPSI.

1079
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,226
>> IF YOU HAVE PEPSI AND

1080
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,644
POPCORN, PLEASE GIVE ME SOME

1081
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,979
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT 150 POUNDS AND

1082
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,356
I'M STARVING.

1083
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,607
[LAUGHTER]

1084
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,316
>> Jeff: DAN, ALSO AT THE LAST

1085
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,443
TRIBAL, YOU GOT TWO VOTES.

1086
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,194
AND I HAVE TO GUESS THAT IT WAS

1087
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,112
A SURPRISE.

1088
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:38,696
>> YEAH.

1089
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,281
AND I DID FIND OUT RIGHT AWAY

1090
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,450
WHO BOTH OF THEM WERE.

1091
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,577
IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU SEE YOUR

1092
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:44,952
NAME WRITTEN DOWN.

1093
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,245
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT.

1094
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,246
AS MUCH AS NOBODY WANTED TO SAY

1095
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,248
WHO WAS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE

1096
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,876
SIX, THAT PAINTED A PRETTY

1097
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,793
CAREER PICTURE TO ME.

1098
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,461
>> Jeff: SO HOW CONCERNED ARE

1099
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,420
YOU THAT IT MIGHT BE YOU?

1100
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,841
>> I'M GREATLY CONCERNED.

1101
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,467
>> Jeff: TYLER, WHAT HAPPENED

1102
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,552
AFTER THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

1103
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,264
YOU GO BACK TO CAMP, DID YOU

1104
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:05,932
SCRAMBLE THIS AFTERNOON?

1105
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,100
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CALL IT

1106
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:08,935
SCRAMBLING, BUT I TOOK A

1107
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,102
AMENDMENT OR TWO TO TOUCH BASE

1108
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:10,686
WITH EVERYBODY THAT I'VE BEEN

1109
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,855
ALIGNED WITH AT ONE POINT OR

1110
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,231
ANOTHER, BUT MIKE IS A

1111
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:14,857
CHARISMATIC GUY.

1112
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,233
I'VE BEEN ON HIS CHOPPING BLOCK

1113
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,529
FOR A WHILE NOW.

1114
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,031
>> Jeff: MIKE, HAS THERE BEEN

1115
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,532
A LOT OF SPECULATION ABOUT THE

1116
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,742
ADVANTAGE THAT DAN GOT AT THE

1117
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:24,992
AUCTION?

1118
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,577
>> I THINK EVERYONE HAS

1119
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,244
SPECULATED ON IT.

1120
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,287
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT I

1121
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:33,125
HOPE IT WAS WORTH $480.

1122
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:33,709
>> Jeff: CAROLYN, THERE'S GOT

1123
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,088
TO BE A LOT OF CONCERN THAT DAN

1124
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,631
HAS THIS ADVANTAGE, THERE'S ONLY

1125
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,757
SEVEN PEOPLE LEFT, SIX AFTER

1126
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,007
TONIGHT.

1127
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,009
>> IT'S SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT

1128
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:42,677
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

1129
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,010
ADVANTAGE IS.

1130
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,054
IT COULD BE ANOTHER HIDDEN

1131
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,681
IMMUNITY IDOL, IT COULD BE THE

1132
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,473
SPECIAL POWERS IDOL THAT TONY

1133
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,184
HAD, SO AN ADVANTAGE IS SOMEWHAT

1134
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,519
OF A THREAT.

1135
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,063
>> Jeff: DAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE

1136
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:54,689
HAVE APPROACHED YOU AND SAID,

1137
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,149
LET'S USE IT, TELL ME WHAT IT IS

1138
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,693
AND MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

1139
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,987
>> EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS

1140
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,446
APPROACHED ME, AND WHETHER

1141
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,990
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT MY ADVANTAGE IS

1142
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,491
OR NOT IS ACTUALLY IRRELEVANT.

1143
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,369
THEY KNOW I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.

1144
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,329
THAT ALL BY ITSELF MAKES ME A

1145
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,750
BIGGER TARGET.

1146
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,543
>> Jeff: SIERRA.

1147
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,919
THIS IS THE PERFECT TRIBAL TO

1148
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,254
MAKE A BIG MOVE.

1149
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,463
IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN

1150
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:19,672
SEVEN.

1151
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,464
>> EXACTLY.

1152
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,050
AND HONESTLY, I THINK THERE'S

1153
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,552
GOING TO BE A REALLY BIG MOVE

1154
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,553
MADE TONIGHT AND EVERYBODY'S

1155
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,097
GOING TO BE SHOCKED AND I THINK

1156
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,265
IT'S MAYBE A MOVE THAT

1157
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,017
EVERYBODY'S BEEN WAITING FOR.

1158
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,021
I'M KEEPING EVERY OPTION OPEN.

1159
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,522
>> Jeff: TYLER, ARE WE AT A

1160
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,024
POINT IN THE GAME IN WHICH

1161
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,608
YOU'RE TAKING OUT A THREAT IN

1162
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,153
CHALLENGES OR ARE YOU LOOKING TO

1163
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,029
KEEP THE PEOPLE THAT YOU THINK

1164
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:43,988
YOU CAN BEAT?

1165
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,948
>> I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO

1166
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,075
THINK ABOUT THE FIVE, FOUR,

1167
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,369
THREE ARENA, AND WHO YOU CAN

1168
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,412
BEAT.

1169
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,789
FOUR OF US ARE LEAVING, AIFER

1170
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,874
EVERY DECISION YOU PERSONALLY

1171
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,333
MAKE AND EVERY NAME YOU WRITE

1172
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,210
DOWN, YOU BETTER GIVE DAMN GOOD

1173
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:58,586
THOUGHT TO.

1174
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,587
>> Jeff: WHAT IF IT IS YOU

1175
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,130
WALKING OUT?

1176
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,006
WILL YOU BE SURPRISED?

1177
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:08,304
>> WOULD BY SURPRISED?

1178
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,431
YES.

1179
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,265
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1180
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,975
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1181
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:24,403
RODNEY, YOU'RE UP.

1182
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,114
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH

1183
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:35,623
THIS BREAKS MY HEART.

1184
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,291
>> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU

1185
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,753
OUT OF THIS GAME FOR A LONG TIME

1186
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:49,261
NOW.

1187
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,938
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1188
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:03,109
VOTES.

1189
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,695
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1190
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,197
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1191
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:19,125
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1192
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:23,295
>> TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

1193
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:31,762
PLAYING IT FOR ME, JEFF.

1194
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,471
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN

1195
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,265
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1196
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,183
ANY VOTES CAST FOR MIKE WILL NOT

1197
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,017
COUNT.

1198
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,604
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1199
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,815
FIRST VOTE, MIKE.

1200
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,944
DOES NOT COUNT.

1201
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:47,153
MIKE.

1202
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,990
DUDS NOT COUNT.

1203
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:51,198
MIKE.

1204
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,535
DUDS NOT COUNT.

1205
00:40:54,618 --> 00:41:00,249
MIKE, DOES NOT COUNT.

1206
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:00,708
TYLER.

1207
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:13,053
ONE VOTE TYLER.

1208
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,930
12th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

1209
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:20,519
FIFTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, TYLER.

1210
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:26,817
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1211
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:32,489
TYLER, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1212
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:43,125
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1213
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,793
>> WELL, IF THERE'S ONE THING

1214
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,754
THAT SHOULD BE MOST CONCERNING

1215
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,256
IS THE ADMISSION THAT EVERYBODY

1216
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,509
WANTS TO TAKE THE WEAKEST TO THE

1217
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:52,676
END.

1218
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,886
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1219
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,137
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1220
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,180
GOOD NIGHT.

1221
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,776
STAY TINED FOR SCENES

1222
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:16,450
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1223
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,618
"SURVIVOR"... THE.

1224
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,329
>> THE ALLIANCE ALWAYS KNEW

1225
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,497
EVENTUALLY WE WERE GOING TO HAVE

1226
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:21,956
TO TURN ON EACH OTHER.

1227
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,291
>> Jeff: THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE

1228
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:24,541
CRUMBLES.

1229
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,252
>> YOUR ALLIANCE CRUMBLES FOR

1230
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:26,418
YOU.

1231
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,671
>> YOUR ALLIANCE IS GUNNING FOR

1232
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:28,837
YOU.

1233
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,633
DAN IS VOTING YOU 1 MILLION

1234
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:41,016
PERCENT.

1235
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,268
>> WHAT CAN I SAY?

1236
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,727
I LEFT IT ALL ON THE FIELD, SO

1237
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:43,978
TO SPEAK.

1238
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,230
MY TACTICS TO GO AFTER DAN

1239
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:46,814
TONIGHT WERE RIGHT, IT'S JUST

1240
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,691
THAT THE REST OF THE GROUP

1241
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,400
DIDN'T FOLLOW SUIT.

1242
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,527
I HAD A BLAST.

1243
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,153
I REGRET NOTHING THAT I DID.

1244
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:53,779
EVERYTHING THAT I DID WAS TO MY

1245
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,780
FULL POTENTIAL.

1246
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,907
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT TO GET AHEAD

1247
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,367
IN THIS GAME IF YOU'RE NOT

1248
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,285
WINNING CHALLENGE, AND

1249
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,286
UNFORTUNATELY I CAME UP A LITTLE

1250
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,370
SHORT TODAY.
