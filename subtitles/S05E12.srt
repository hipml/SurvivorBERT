00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:04,421
JEFF PROBST:<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Survivor...<i> Brian won</i>

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,424
<i>the reward challenge and chose</i>
<i>to take Clay with him</i>

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,842
<i>o the mainland,</i>
<i>for an elephant trek.</i>

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,386
BRIAN:<i> We're more than halfway</i>
<i>through the game, and this is</i>

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,929
<i>an excellent time for us</i>
<i>to just clear our heads,</i>

6
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,806
get away from everyone.

7
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,101
TED:<i> I kind of knew there was</i>
<i>a bond between Clay and Brian,</i>

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,437
but the fact that he did
select Clay kind of just told me

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,522
that that bond is closer
than what I thought it was.

10
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,107
PROBST:
<i>Back at camp,</i>

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,152
<i>Jake was trying hard</i>
<i>to stay in the game.</i>

12
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,488
<i>He tried to convince Helen</i>
<i>to turn on Brian or Clay.</i>

13
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,782
JAKE:<i> Course, if she</i>
<i>got rid of Brian and Clay,</i>

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,451
I think I'd be back in the hunt.

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,454
PROBST:<i> Penny was also</i>
<i>fighting to stay on the island.</i>

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,290
<i>She severed her ties</i>
<i>with former ally Jake</i>

17
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,459
<i>when she helped eliminate him</i>
<i>from the immunity challenge.</i>

18
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,588
PENNY:<i> I was trying to send</i>
<i>a message to Chuay Gahn that</i>

19
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,132
Jake and I don't really have
an alliance anymore.

20
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,844
PROBST:<i> At Tribal Council,</i>
<i>Jake spoke out in desperation.</i>

21
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,304
At last Tribal Council,

22
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,348
I heard from this tribe
that they vote people off

23
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,809
based on how
a person really performs.

24
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,645
I think my performance stands up
to everybody's on the tribe,

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,858
and I'll be kind of curious
tonight if that still holds up.

26
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,444
PROBST:<i> When the votes came in,</i>
<i>Penny took the fall.</i>

27
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,279
Penny, the tribe has spoken.

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,073
<i>Six are left.</i>

29
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,992
<i>Tonight, one more will go.</i>

30
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,402
JAN:
<i>During Tribal Council,</i>

31
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,904
<i>Jake said, "I feel like</i>
<i>I'm one of the hardest workers</i>

32
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,906
<i>"out here; a lot harder worker</i>

33
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,409
<i>than some of the others</i>
<i>in the tribe."</i>

34
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,705
And Clay doesn't really simmer
with things like that real well.

35
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,081
How'd you like that statement

36
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,332
up there
at that Council meeting?

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,086
But we know where
number day three lays.

38
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,922
JACK:<i> What they said</i>
<i>last Tribal Council was,</i>

39
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,758
anybody that did not produce
was the one who was going.

40
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,553
And I gotta tell you,
I'll put my production up,

41
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,597
<i>basically, against anybody's.</i>

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,848
<i>And that offended Clay.</i>

43
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,225
CLAY: I think everybody in this
camp works just as hard as you.

44
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,561
JAKE: No, I didn't say I worked
any harder. I just said that--

45
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,271
CLAY: Well, somebody's got
to get their ass kicked off.

46
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,273
HELEN:<i> Quite frankly,</i>
<i>I don't think Clay</i>

47
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,984
<i>liked that playing</i>
<i>at Tribal Council,</i>

48
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,986
because it was true.

49
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,613
Jake does more than Clay.

50
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,740
Why do you think Clay got upset?

51
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>People working</i>
<i>know they're working.</i>

52
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,784
<i>The people skating</i>

53
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,911
know they're skating.

54
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,953
And he was ticked

55
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,455
<i>that Jake brought that up.</i>

56
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,665
CLAY: We thought
you were a bigger person--

57
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,126
that we'd think you'd just
stand up and slap all five

58
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,628
of us right square in the face.

59
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,630
-I didn't slap anybody.
-You slapped all five of us

60
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,632
right square in the face--
the hell you didn't.

61
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,176
No, what I said was, see,
at the last Tribal Council...

62
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,637
I'm gonna test y'all to see
if y'all are sayin'

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,096
what y'all are doing--
that the people that work

64
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,973
get to stay on the tribe.

65
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,808
TED:<i> Clay is definitely starting</i>
<i>to get on my nerves.</i>

66
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,061
The outburst that he had,
I thought,

67
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,939
was very, very childish
and uncalled for.

68
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,817
<i>I didn't see anything wrong</i>
<i>with Jake's comment.</i>

69
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,027
<i>It was just words.</i>

70
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,029
<i>So what if he felt that way?</i>

71
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,739
Who gives a heck?

72
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,574
Are you proud of me?

73
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,201
That was messed up,
what you did.

74
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,954
(Clay chuckles)

75
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,706
CLAY:
It had to be said.

76
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,960
Just had to.

77
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,795
I just had to.

78
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,202
31 days.

79
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,080
Overall, we're
physically whupped.

80
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,333
You take 31 days in a cave,
living off

81
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,584
<i>whatever you can find.</i>

82
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,211
<i>I've lost way,</i>
<i>way too much weight.</i>

83
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,295
<i>I miss my family,</i>

84
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,381
<i>I miss home, and we're</i>
<i>to the point now</i>

85
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,966
<i>where you can start</i>
<i>smelling it.</i>

86
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,010
<i>You know it's coming,</i>
<i>it's not long.</i>

87
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,767
<i>JAKE: Every day I spend</i>
<i>a little bit of time</i>

88
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,853
<i>just kind of jotting down</i>

89
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,229
what I've been doing here.

90
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,064
You know, it's kind of like
a letter to my wife.

91
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,774
In fact, it is a letter
to my wife--

92
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,319
<i>a little journal of what's</i>
<i>happening through the day,</i>

93
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,073
<i>and with a lot</i>
<i>of "I miss you" kind of stuff</i>

94
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,199
<i>rolled into it.</i>

95
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:30,413
<i>I can see</i>
<i>the ending's in sight and, uh,</i>

96
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,375
I just sit here waiting on
the next challenge.

97
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,093
Oh, boy, mail delivery.

98
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,053
-Mail call!
-JAN: Mail!

99
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,387
Mail call!

100
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,931
Oh! It's beautiful.

101
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,974
We get a sneak peek.

-We get to sneak peak.

103

-Oh-oh-oh-oh!
-We're gonna eat.

104
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,770
We're gonna eat.
We're gonna eat.

105
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,855
<i>Helen and I went down</i>
<i>and got treemail.</i>

106
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,607
It was in
a real neat little container.

107
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,859
We opened it up and
there was rice-- oh, God!--

108
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,860
so we were so excited.

109
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,404
We're eating! We're eating!

JAKE: Oh, my gosh, the girls
came sprinting back up there.

114
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,872
Now these are people
who can hardly walk,

115
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,123
and they sprinted up here.

116
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,249

00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,280
they'll look for water,

172
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,448
they'll do everything
you're doing.

173
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,326
For the losers, nothing.

174
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,119
Hear me clearly.

175
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,454
Not a kiss...

176
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,330
Oh!

177
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,124
...not a hug, not a handshake.

178
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,670
You guys have been out here
over a month.

179
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,131
And so far, you've been able to
find enough coconuts and clams

180
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,341
-Chicken feed.
-...and edible plants,

181
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,594
that you've been able to avoid
having to live off the bugs

182
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,471
and the insects
that are out here.

183
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,683
But what I'm curious about is,
would you eat those bugs

184
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,602
and those insects
if it meant getting to spend

185
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,980
one full day
with your loved one?

186
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,439
JAN:
Absolutely.

187
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,024
Pick the son of a bitch up,
I'll eat it.

188
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,317
I'm ready.

189
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,319
I'd eat
whatever I needed to eat

190
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,614
to be with my baby boy.

191
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,950
And you know what?
I believe you guys.

192
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,786
I believe all of you would do
just about anything

193
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,121
to win this reward.

194
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,164
But that's not the question.

195
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,624
The question is...

196
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,583
would they?

197
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,379
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no!

198
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,839

Eat! Eat!

208
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,407
of the most edible creatures
found out here in the jungle.

209
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,201
There will be several courses.

210
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,538
If you fail to finish a course,
you'll be excused from the table

211
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:26,375
and sent back with no contact
with your loved ones whatsoever.

212
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,005
For the winner, 24 hours as
an honorary member of the tribe.

You guys bring an appetite?

214

Yeah, pretty much.

I'll go get your
first course.

First course, ants:
red ants and flying ants.

PROBST:
No, they're dead.

219

nothing in there bad for you.

221
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,908

spoonful, just like cereal.

source of nutrition--

a water roach.

250
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,679
You're gonna do this as a group.

251
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,888
This is not a time trial.

252
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:07,017
All you have to do is get it
down and you move on, okay?

This is a timed trial--
only two will move on.

I tried. I tried.

344
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,489
Unfortunately,

I love you, baby boy.

347
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,495
Linda.

348
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,539
(crying)

349
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,628
-I love you.
-I love you.

350
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,129
It's time for you to go.

351
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,298
-I love you.
-I love you.

352
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,676
-Bye, I love you.
-Bye, I love you.

353
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,678
(sobbing)

354
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,853
Alwan, you came out here

355
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,229
to do anything it took
to see your brother.

356
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,147
You gave it everything you had.

357
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,358
You just got outplayed--
part of the game.

358
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,525
-Time for you to go.
-I accept that.

359
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,360
TED:
Yo.

360
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,861
-I love you, bro.
-I love you, man.

361
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:46,654
Tell everyone I said
I love them, all right?

362
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,489
I will. I will.

363
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,782
-Oh, he's bald, too.
-Love you, bro.

364
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,743
-HELEN: He's bald, too!
-CLAY: He's bald, too!

365
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,744
Who knew?

366
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,829
Who expected this?

367
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,540
Let's get to the next course.

368
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,334
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

369
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,045
Hang tight. Come here.

370
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:07,216
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

371
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,218
Is he alive? Yes.

372
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,386
See if I can get him

373
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,055
to come up out of here
and say hello.

374
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,890
LINDA:
Oh, I can't stand spiders.

375
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,725
PROBST:
That's a tarantula.

376
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,519
LINDA:
It's a tarantula.

377
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,437
-It's obviously alive.
-Tarantula.

378
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,356
It's got a lot of fur on it,

379
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,234
but it's absolutely
harmless... okay?

380
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,985
LINDA: You're not gonna ask us
to eat that, are you?

381
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,446
No.

382
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,198
That one's alive.

383
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,410
That's been boiled.

384
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,412
Oh, my God.

385
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,287
PROBST:
It's not alive.

386
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,123
It's like a peach.

387
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,916
Here's how this round works.

388
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,460
You have one minute to eat this.

389
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,754
I don't care where you're at
when we hit a minute.

390
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,882
If it is not
an empty mouth, you're out.

391
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,343
If you both fail,
neither of you get to spend

392
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,928
a day with your loved one.

393
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:56,098
If you both succeed,
we move on to a tiebreaker.

394
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,808
Your 60 seconds begin now.

395
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,851
Go.

396
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,108
Swallow it
as quick as you can.

397
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,285
HELEN: Please, please,
please, please.

398
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,286
(Jim coughs)

399
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,454
Please. Please.

400
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,455
(coughs)

401
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,457
Please... Please...

402
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,132
PROBST:
You can do anything.

403
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,967
You took three grubs.

404
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,302
Come on, baby, you can do it.

405
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,596
-Swallow it as quick as you can.
-(coughs)

406
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,102
PROBST:
30 seconds.

407
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,984
It's okay, babe.

408
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,199
-PROBST: Look at that.
-Thank you! Thank you!

409
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,619
-JAN: Way to go!
-PROBST: 20 seconds.

410
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,496
You can do it, babe.

411
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,624
Fifteen.

412
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,292
Look at that.

413
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,127
One tarantula.

414
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,837
Do I not want this bad
or what?

415
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,673
(Clay chuckles)

416
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,050
I waited a long time...

417
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,511
and I'm doing it.

418
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,512
PROBST:
Guys, this is it.

419
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,013
This is the finale.

420
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,431
This is a timed trial.

421
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,016
I have two scorpions.

422
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,309
They've been boiled.

423
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,019
They're lethal
when they're alive.

424
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,354
They're fine when they're dead.

425
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,522
First one to finish

426
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,024
gets 24 hours
with their loved one.

427
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,526
Loser going home.

428
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,403
Jimmy, please, please,
please, please.

429
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,157
-Go. -Please, please,
please, Jimmy.

430
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,033
Jimmy, please.

431
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,326
I need it, I need it, I need it.

432
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,410
PROBST: Swallow that, Jenny.
You're behind.

433
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,411
HELEN:
I need it.

434
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,913
Please, Jimmy, swallow it.

435
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,206
You've got to swallow it--
please, please.

436
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,874
PROBST: You guys
better not screw around.

437
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,418
You're taking way too long,
way too long.

438
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,419
Please, please, I need it,
I need it.

439
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,712
(Jimmy coughs)

440
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,713
Keep it down, keep it down.

441
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,382
Tighten that stomach.

442
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,758
-You gotta get swallowing,
Jenny. -Keep it down.

443
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,218
Tighten that stomach
and keep it down.

444
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,469
JAKE:
You gotta swallow it, Jenny.

445
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,346
Do it now
or you guys are gonna lose.

446
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,764
Somebody's gotta swallow soon.

447
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,849
You gotta swallow.

448
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,184
Please, Jimmy.

449
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,853
You gotta swallow,
Jenny, baby.

450
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,396
Jimmy, please, Jimmy, please.

451
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,355
You gotta swallow, Jenny, baby.

452
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,274
Jimmy, swallow, Jimmy, swallow.

453
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,316
Please, Jimmy.

454
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,360
Oh... there it goes.

455
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,028
-Please, please...
-JAKE: It's okay, Jenny.

456
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,363
I need it...

457
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,616
(all cheering, applauding)

458
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,076
Thank you!

459
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,914
(spitting)

460
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,250
JAN:
Good job, Jenny!

461
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,376
Good job!

462
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,546
JENNY (quietly):
I'm so sorry.

463
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,590
I'm sorry, baby.

464
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,966
(crying):
I'm sorry, babe.

465
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,926
Oh, Jeff.

466
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,929
Jenny, it's time for you to go.

467
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,973
JAN:
Bye-bye, Jenny.

468
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,308
Good job!

469
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,475
I love you, babe.

470
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,270
I love you, babe.

471
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,690
(quietly):
I know...

472
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,070
All right, Jim, come here.

473
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,614
JAN:
Oh, yeah!

474
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,282
Wouldn't be right
without a buff.

475
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,744
But I know there's something you
want a lot more than that.

476
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,454
Get over here and give
your man a hug.

477
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,622
(screaming, laughing)

478
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,498

479
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,544
TED:
So cool.

480
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,133
HELEN:
Yeah! Oh, boy!

481
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,761
Jim, you are now a tribe member
for 24 hours.

482
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,430
Have a great experience.

483
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,938
Come on.

484
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,606
TED:
Come on back here, Jim.

485
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,316
(all chattering excitedly)

486
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,653
There was no way I was losing
that contest, absolutely no way.

487
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,739
<i>I was gonna do whatever it</i>
<i>took to win that</i>

488
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,990
<i>so I could</i>
<i>spend 24 hours with Helen.</i>

489
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,492
-These are our torches.
-Uh-huh.

490
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,286
-Oh, she won immunity last time.
-Clay had it before.

491
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,455
I told him it was a girly
necklace; it needed to be on me.

492
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,831
Yeah, I was kinda
going around showing him,

493
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,959
like, "Oh, my God, this is
where we sleep"

494
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,462
<i>and showing him</i>
<i>our food situation.</i>

495
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:59,466
There's coconut, toasted coconut
and shredded coconut,

496
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,677
and some lemongrass-- there's
the crabs right there.

497
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,304
Any tarantula?

498
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,515
No, no-- yeah,
you're probably full.

499
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,059
I was surprised at how proud
they were

500
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,311
of... the cond--
what they've done there.

501
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,521
They were very proud.

502
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,271
They're all running around,
showing me,

503
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,481
<i>"Oh, this is where we cook,</i>

504
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,525
<i>this is where we sleep.</i>
<i>We sleep outside here."</i>

505
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,026
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I'm looking at it going,</i>

506
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,653
<i>"Oh, God, get me to a hotel."</i>

507
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,905
You know, this is not
the Helen that I know.

508
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,573
This is wonderful;
this is lovely.

509
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,701
I guess the losers
get two nights out here.

510
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,952
(laughter)

511
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,662
Yeah, really.

512
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,913
Jim, does she ever talk recipes

513
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,915
or she do any cooking right now?

514
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,208
Does she-- what are-- what?

515
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,086
HELEN: I know-- does she talk
food and cooking and recipes?

516
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,546
Yes, yes.

517
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,381
So you're thinkin'
I've got an accent,

518
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,674

519

TED:
Good ol' redneck boy.

00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,180
JAN: Where am I gonna go
in this big giant bed?

522
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,057
TED:
Come down with us.

523
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,351
But the snakes and things
will get me.

524
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,686
TED: Hey, they need
their privacy.

525
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,146
Let 'em, let 'em have
their privacy.

526
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,230
Let 'em have their moment.

527
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:56,231
I'll come down there
and give them

528
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,691
the presidential suite
tonight, by yourself.

529
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,359
There you go.
Let 'em have their moment.

530
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,569
Night, Jim, night, Helen.

531
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,112
HELEN:
Night.

532
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,532
<i>We gave 'em the honeymoon suite</i>
<i>for the evening,</i>

533
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,911
and tried to listen, but we
couldn't hear anything.

534
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,788
HELEN:
Jan, Clay, Brian, me and Ted

535
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,750
are the original
Chuay Gahn tribe.

536
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,418
Sook Jai tribe merged with us.

537
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,336
<i>We had a very nice evening</i>

538
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,546
<i>talking, talking, talking,</i>

539
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,089
<i>talking, talking, talking,</i>
<i>talking, talking.</i>

540
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,761
(both laughing)

541
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,931
You have no idea how not having
family out here is

542
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,435
actually
physically painful.

543
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,437
<i>You just don't know it</i>
<i>till you get out here,</i>

544
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,646
<i>how huge family is.</i>

545
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,399
<i>Man, just nothing else matters.</i>

546
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,974
HELEN: I think I've been on
every single water run there was

547
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:17,270
except maybe one or two.

548
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,190
-JIM: You swam this way?
-Yes.

549
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,819
<i>I decided to take Jim on the</i>
<i>canoe ride today to show him</i>

550
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,195
<i>where we get the water,</i>

551
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,155
so that he could get
the full experience

552
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,283
of the fact that you don't
go out and turn on the tap.

553
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,496
JIM:
You got a comb with you, right?

554
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,456
It takes about ten.

555
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,335
You have to do this
every other day?

556
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,586
About, yeah.

557
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,673
<i>I'm a little surprised at</i>
<i>how well Helen was able</i>

558
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,966
to adapt to this.

559
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,425
She's the one that--

560
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,052
a two-star hotel, you know,
is roughing it.

561
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,847
(Helen sighs)

562
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,306
<i>She's adapted wonderfully.</i>

563
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,975
<i>I haven't heard her complaining</i>
<i>about anything.</i>

564
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,644
HELEN:
Oh, God!

565
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,689
<i>She does what she has to do</i>
<i>to survive, to get along.</i>

566
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,357
Oh!

567
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,692
(chuckles)

568
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,694
Nobody will know about this.

569
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,321
She's gonna do what it, what it
takes to win the game.

570
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,992
She didn't come here
to come in third.

571
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,910
You see what I'm up against.

572
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,539
See, Brian'll play fair and
with integrity, Clay won't.

573
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,167
Clay's out for Clay,
he's a selfish son of a gun

574
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,835
and he'll cut
everybody's throat here,

575
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,837
if he thinks
it'll get him the million.

576
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,088
I trust Brian.

577
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,214
Brian's an up-front guy.

578
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,175
I don't trust Clay.

579
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,427
<i>What I'm trying to figure out</i>
<i>is can I flip Jan,</i>

580
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,220
<i>can I flip Ted,</i>
<i>can I flip Brian?</i>

581
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,680
<i>Can I get Clay out?</i>

582
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,891
But I've seen the way
the people react to you.

583
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,726
You really don't--
maybe you don't need Brian.

584
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,061
Get rid of the person that's
the biggest threat.

585
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,355
I just wouldn't
feel right doing that.

586
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,773
<i>I-I thought she would do</i>
<i>anything</i>

587
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,192
<i>for the million dollars,</i>

588
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,402
and she said, "I also
want to do what's right."

589
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,112
And I was a little surprised
by that.

590
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:53,116
Morally, I know I would not
be this far

591
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,035
if it hadn't been for Brian.

592
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,371
So could I begrudge him
a million? No.

593
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,583
And he told me, he goes, "Hey,
H., I'm taking you with me.

594
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,584
I'm taking you along."

595
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,921
And when he told me that,
I was, like, "Whoa."

596
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,465
You're doing it right so far,
so I'm not gonna...

597
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,759
Whatever you're doing,
you're doing it right.

598
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,803
<i>Just in being able to talk</i>
<i>about the game</i>

599
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,096
<i>and strategize with Jim,</i>

600
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,723
I'm gonna dread
seeing him go,

601
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,434
but I've been
so recharged on this,

602
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,312
that, um... I'm-I'm
gonna be fine.

603
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,397
(low, indistinct conversation)

604
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:32,280
I'll look for something like
this and, oh, there's a clam

605
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,115
or what they're calling clams.

606
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,368
-JIM: Let me see.
-BRIAN: Yeah, there you go.

607
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,131
HELEN:
That's his?

608
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,301
<i>Spending the day with Jim was</i>
<i>the huge</i>

609
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:59,057
mountaintop high,
and then the crushing low.

610
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,146
JIM (whispers): Do what
Machiavelli would do.

611
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,940
(Helen sobbing)

612
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,987
<i>I felt bad about being so low</i>

613
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,154
because I didn't think
the other people

614
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,155
needed to see that.

615
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,324
They didn't get a day at all.

616
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,994
Um, I was very aware
of that, and, um,

617
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,954
<i>you know,</i>
<i>I was the lucky one,</i>

618
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,832
<i>and I didn't want them</i>
<i>to be looking at me going,</i>

619
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,500
<i>"Geez, you know, what is</i>
<i>she upset about?</i>

620
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,836
<i>She had 24 hours with him."</i>

621
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,504
HELEN:
<i>In a strange way,</i>

622
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:15,383
<i>I almost wish it hadn't</i>
<i>happened because, um...</i>

623
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,053
those lows are so low.

624
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,347
It's hard.

625
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,390
-(sniffles)
<i>-I knew it'd be hard;</i>

626
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,226
<i>I... didn't think</i>
<i>it'd be</i> that<i> hard.</i>

627
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,103
(sniffles)

628
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,154

629
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,419
TED:

630
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,254
Treemail!

631
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,509
Ding-a-ling-a-ling-
a-ling-a-ling-a-ling!

632
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,135
Let's see what it says.

633
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,096
"Think outside the box.

634
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,640
"Pieces may fall
right into place.

635
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,435
Or be the next to go
if you fail to win this race."

636
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,647
CLAY:<i> Wow, we've got an immunity</i>
<i>challenge, and I need it.</i>

637
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,484
There's five people
from the other, uh, tribe

638
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,486
<i>and one person from my tribe.</i>

639
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,656
<i>And that's pretty strong cards</i>
<i>stacked against you.</i>

640
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,783
-Let's go do it to it.
<i>-But I'm telling you what,</i>

641
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,495
<i>Jenny is the biggest</i>
<i>inspiration that I could get.</i>

642
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,124
What she did,
just trying to get to me,

643
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,292
<i>gave me so much inspiration,</i>

644
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,294
<i>that I really feel like today</i>

645
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,131
<i>I could run</i>
<i>through a brick wall.</i>

646
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,970
PROBST:
Hey, guys.

647
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,763
-Hey, Jeff. How are you?
-How's it going?

648
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,141
-PROBST: How are you doing?
-Good. Super.

649
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,647
First things first.

650
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,649
I'll take back immunity.

651
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,157
Once again, immunity
back up for grabs.

652
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,825
Let's get to today's challenge.

653
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,662
We're at the stage of the game
where every single move counts.

654
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,330
That brings us
to today's immunity challenge.

655
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,291
You're gonna build a cube.

656
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,168
<i>There are eight sides</i>
<i>to the cube.</i>

657
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,712
<i>The pieces only</i>
<i>fit together one way.</i>

658
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,339
<i>You'll pick a color, and</i>
<i>when your cube is put together,</i>

659
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,717
all sides, including
the top and the bottom,

660
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,510
must show that color.

661
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,805
First person to correctly
assemble their cube

662
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,016
wins immunity,
cannot be voted out,

663
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,311
is down to a one-in-five shot
of winning this thing.

664
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,563
-Big enough stakes?
-Got it. -Yes, absolutely.

665
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,689
I didn't get to ask.

666
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:37,525
How was it having, uh,
having your husband out here?

667
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,360
There are no words
to describe it.

668
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,361
What was the best part?

669
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,489
Was it having
the shared experience that...

670
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,823
Touching him.

671
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,158
Talking to him.

672
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,242
The love.

673
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,410
How about you, Jake?

674
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,620
Jenny could not have been

675
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,079
closer to winning this thing.

676
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,206
She ate everything.

677
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,373
She just got outplayed

678
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,000
by seconds by Jim.

679
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,127
She tried so hard.

680
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,003
She didn't want to leave.

681
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,380
Well, look, none
of them wanted to leave.

682
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,673
That's right.

683
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,051
Funny thing is... they didn't.

684
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,677
What?

685
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,556
-You've got to be kidding!
-Go, guys,

686
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,558
-give 'em a hug. Go, go, go!
-Oh!

687
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,645
(excited shouting)

688
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,441
(indistinct shouts, laughter)

689
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,109
I can't believe
they kept you here!

690
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,371
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

691
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,041
I love you so much.

692
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,376

693
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,795
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

694
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,255
I'm so proud of you!

695
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,506
Everything's fine!

696
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,967
How do you feel about how you've
been taken care of this week?

697
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,802
-Win it all, baby.
-I'm gonna try to.

698
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,928
That's the plan.

699
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,929
I'm gonna try to.

700
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,931
I got a plan going,
too, big-time.

701
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,558
-Big plan, okay?
-Okay.

702
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,059
It's all good.

703
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,645
Guys... as much as I am a fan

704
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,938
-of the love affair...
-JAN: No! No!

705
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,481
PROBST:
No? It's all good.

706
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,316
They're here for another reason.

707
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,610
Your loved ones are
gonna be your partner

708
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,778
in today's immunity challenge.

709
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,196
(cheering)

710
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,784
-You're gonna be tied together.
-TED: Tied together?

711
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:13,121
You are gonna win or lose
today's immunity based on

712
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,456
how well you work
with your loved one.

713
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,791
That's what I'm talking about.

714
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,459
So you can have them
to cheer at the end,

715
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,920
or you can blame it
on them-- who knows?

716
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,755
Take your spots; any spot'll do.

717
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,257
Let's go.

718
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,925
Everybody's tied at the wrist.

719
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,012
On my go, claim your color.

720
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,472
Immunity at stake.

There are eight pieces.

You're looking for eight pieces.

They only go together one way.

739
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,801
Brian and CeCe getting started.

BRIAN:
Okay...

745
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,360
It's gonna stick nails,
pack that one on top.

746
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,527
Perfect. Over here.

747
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,862
Perfect.

Any more boxes?

-TED: No.
-What's that?

754
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,835

-Ah.

Hurry, hurry.

00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,888
This goes underneath.

762
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:54,889
Okay.

763
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:58,101
Take this one here, this way.

00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,938
Flip it.

Big Ted and Alwan!

Big Ted.

-Yes.
-HELEN: Immunity for you!

777
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,586
Hold tight right there.
Turn around.

778
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,587
Can my brother wear it
a little bit?

779
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,214
No, your brother
isn't in this game anymore.

780
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,757
-(chuckles)
-Look at the pretty girl.

781
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,801
Oh! Ah!

782
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,052
Looks good on him.

783
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,762
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

784
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,889
Take a final moment,
say your last good-byes.

785
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,933
You take care, stay healthy.

786
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:43,271
Guys, you got to head out now,
back from where you came.

787

Say good-bye.

-All right, baby.
-Say good-bye.

789

This way, loved ones.

Be good, baby.

00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,820
Ah!

792
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,489
Clay, where you going?

793
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,615
You're going back to camp.

794
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,908
I'm walking to the door.

795
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,452
Come on, baby.

796
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,246
Love you.

797
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,331
Bye!

798
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,295
My dawg!

800
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,549
Survivors, hit it.

801
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,661
JAKE:
They got us every time.

802
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,455
TED:
I did not expect that at all.

803
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,539
JAKE:
What a deal.

804
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,375
Whoo, but it felt good,
just to see my brother, boy.

805
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,711
If you can wipe the smile
off my face today,

806
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,505
I'd like to know
what it would be.

807
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,672
(laughter)

808
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,674
JAKE:<i> You know,</i>
<i>it was one of those things.</i>

809
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,509
<i>I went into that today</i>

810
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:59,514
knowing that
I had to win immunity.

811
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,807
Now it doesn't matter.

812
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,183
(chuckles)

813
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,018
'Cause I know
what's really important.

814
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,646
<i>It's about love,</i>
<i>it's about your family.</i>

815
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,606
Here, Teddy,
I love you, too, big guy.

816
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,816
Thanks, man. Thanks, Jake.

817
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,151
-Congratulations on winning
that. -Appreciate that, man.

818
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,821
JAKE:
<i>And it makes you realize</i>

819
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,532
<i>how special it really is</i>

820
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,369
<i>to be able to experience</i>

821
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,748
33 days in a cave
and on a beach...

822
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,584
without your loved one
and then to be able to see them.

823
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,838
<i>And how it makes you feel.</i>

824
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,771
Next plan of attack.

825
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,189
I'll be back in a minute.

826
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,941
-Oh, you got to go?
-Yeah.

827
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,402
HELEN:
<i>I have to get Brian aside</i>

828
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,696
<i>and run some strategy by him</i>

829
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,699
and just get some
opinion work done there.

830
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,367
I don't trust Clay.

831
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,910
I don't, I'm sorry.

832
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,997
Do you feel that he has earned,

833
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,749
through merit,
a number one or two spot?

834
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,126
<i>I trust Brian.</i>

835
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,752
I don't think Brian would
ever look at me

836
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,588
and try to dupe me on something,

837
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,589
<i>play me for a fool.</i>

838
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,923
<i>And I wouldn't do that to him.</i>

839
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,091
I hear you.

840
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:18,968
Um, what you're saying.

841
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,429
And I'm, uh, I'm considering
that as well.

842
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,764
HELEN:
<i>But I talked about perhaps</i>

843
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,892
pulling in Ted and Jan
and trying to form

844
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,768
<i>a threesome and take out Clay.</i>

845
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,228
I don't want him in that spot.

846
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,438
-So...
-Okay.

847
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,273
Let me, um--
I gotta dwell on that.

848
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,609
-We worked the whole time.
-I know. I know.

849
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,193
There wasn't a job we didn't do.

850
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,906
<i>Quite frankly,</i>
<i>Clay does squat at camp.</i>

851
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,117
He has gone on one

852
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,204
<i>water run in 32 days, and he</i>
<i>swamped the boat when he went.</i>

853
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,957
That stuff goes right up my...
(mumbles)

854
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,626
...and hell no!

855
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:56,255
BRIAN: So... I was, like,
I'm not sure about Clay.

856
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,760
<i>This is where practical logical</i>
<i>business sense comes into mind</i>

857

and you've got to have--
keep your mind open

858
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,679
and then adapt accordingly.

859
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,931
Switch, jump ship here.

860
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,307
'Cause it's a game of survival.

861
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,475
I mean, this is a game.

-TED: You guys ready?
-CLAY: Ready.

863
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,648

00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,484
<i>Who's got a little bit</i>
<i>of control.</i>

866
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,945
Right now,
I got a little bit of both.

867
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,511
We'll now bring in
the members of our jury.

868
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,516
Erin, Ken, and our newest
jury member, Penny,

869
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,519
voted out at the last
Tribal Council.

870
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,022
So, Chuay Jai, based on
the visit from your loved ones,

871
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,191
I'm just guessing
that the last three days

872
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,527
have been probably
the most emotional

873
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,487
you guys have had
in a while.

874
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,697
Clay?

875
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,699
Without a doubt,
the most emotional,

876
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,159
uh, probably in my life.

877
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,869
How much fun was it
for you, Helen,

878
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,706
not only to have Jim,
your husband here, but

879
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,709
to have him experience
your new family?

880
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,210
It was absolute-- I don't know--

881
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,045
it was the best medicine
I could have ever had

882
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,046
to have him with me.

883
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,756
I wasn't hungry that night.

884
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,966
But I loved today.

885
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:26,053
I got to see Jim again and
I got to meet everybody else's

886
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,889
family member that we've heard
about this whole time.

887
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,643
And it's a tough,
it's a tough platform to walk,

888
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,896
because I don't want to say
good-bye to any of these people.

889
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,191
Clay, does an experience
like today impact, at all,

890
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,109
how you vote?

891
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,944
It was already made up
before I got here.

892
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,280
I mean, we've had
a little tension in camp,

893
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,574
and, uh, it's not gonna be there
after tonight.

894
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,784
I mean, regardless of what
happened here on the island,

895
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,578
we've all bonded,

896
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,080
and, uh, there's a friendship
here that, uh,

897
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:53,914
you can't lick.

898
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,791
And, uh, we'll be
friends forever.

899
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,419
Jake, what are you
basing your vote on tonight?

900
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,587
Well, I really don't know,

901
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,547
'cause I really like
all these people.

902
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,425
They got a little upset with me
because I played a game.

903
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,593
That's okay.

904
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,553
This is the way it turned out.

905
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,847
It's been an incredible
experience for me.

906
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,058
Brian, at this point
in the game,

907
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,060
are you voting to get rid of
somebody or are you voting

908
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,644
for who you want to keep around?

909
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,438
Well, at this point in the game,
we still do have

910
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,275
a little bit of time, but, uh,
I think the person who, uh,

911
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,985
is probably not
gonna be here tonight,

912
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,445
uh, brought this upon himself,

913
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,782
uh, with certain actions
and certain, uh, events

914
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,576
that, uh, could have been,
uh, prevented, I think.

915
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,620
Simple as that.
It's just about moving forward.

916
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,456
Big Ted, you are wearing
the immunity necklace.

917
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,415
You're safe with it.

918
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,666
Everybody else is fair game.

919
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,667
It is time to vote.

920
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,336
Helen, you're up.

921
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,193
Jake, let bygones be bygones.

922
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,612
We're too close of neighbors
to be enemies.

923
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,001
Positivity goes
a long, long way, my friend.

924
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,338
You need a little bit more
positivity in your life.

925
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,323
I'll go tally the votes.

926
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,043
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

927
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,211
Person will be asked to leave

928
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,880
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

929
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,132
I'll read the votes.

930
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,596
Jake.

931
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,978
Jake.

932
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,443
Jake.

933
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,157
Jake. That's four
and that's enough.

934
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,742
No need to read the last votes.

935
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,076
Need to bring me your torch.

936
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,378
Jake, the tribe has spoken.

937
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,258
It's time for you to go.

938
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,259
Thanks, guys.

939
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,928
Good luck to all of you.

940
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,054
I'll see you.

941
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,097
Take it easy.

942
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,949
PROBST:
I gotta say,

943
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,285
I'm fascinated that
after everything that went on

944
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,620
the last three days,

945
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,624
still another easy vote,
right down tribal lines,

946
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,502
without so much as a hesitation.

947
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,337
Well, you made it
to the final five.

948
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,631
All five of you
are from the same tribe.

949
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,843
Game's about to get
very, very complicated.

950
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,512
Guys can head back to camp.

951
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,596
Good night.

952
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,943
<i>Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

953
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,155

954
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,825
<i>The former Chuay Gahns</i>

<i>I'm gonna continue to trust,</i>

956
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,872

957
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,125

00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,213
<i>And a</i> Survivor<i> getaway.</i>

961

(speaks Thai)

963
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,306
I'm almost 61.

964
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,850
In fact, I'll be 61 here
just real quick.

965
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,810

968
