1
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,462
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON<i> SURVIVOR:</i>

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,465
SASH AND BRENDA WERE KING
AND QUEEN OF THE BEACH.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,759
>> WE'RE THE TWO MOST POWERFUL
PEOPLE IN THIS GAME.

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,177
>> Jeff: AND THEY THOUGHT
EVERYONE ELSE WAS A PEASANT.

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,930
>> PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER
WHERE THEIR PLACE IS.

6
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:14,639
>> Jeff: THEIR ALLIANCE WAS
STRENGTHENED

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,725
BY TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS.

8
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,226
BRENDA'S BEST FRIEND
NAONKA HAD ONE...

9
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,437
>> IT'S THE KEY TO OUR LIFE
IN THE GAME.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,105
>> Jeff: ...AND SASH HAD
THE OTHER.

11
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,608
BUT SOME OF THE PEASANTS
WERE GETTING RESTLESS.

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,985
>> THERE IS A TEMPTATION

13
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,612
TO WANT TO SUDDENLY JUST TAKE
CONTROL AND MAKE A MOVE.

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,739
WHOO!

15
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,449
>> YEAH, MARTY!

16
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,951
>> Jeff: SO AT THE REWARD FEAST,
MARTY SUCCUMBED TO TEMPTATION

17
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,912
AND TRIED TO LAUNCH
AN ALL-GUYS REBELLION.

18
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,247
>> WE'RE TAKING THIS THING
TO THE END, MEN.

19
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,290
>> WE EARNED IT!

20
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,625
>> NICE JOB TODAY, MAN.

21
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,587
>> Jeff: FABIO AND BENRY
IMMEDIATELY JUMPED ON BOARD.

22
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,797
>> MARTY'S A SMART GUY.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

23
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,257
>> Jeff: SASH FOOLED MARTY

24
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,509
BY PRETENDING
TO JOIN UP WITH HIM.

25
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,303
>> I TRIED TO BOOST HIS EGO

26
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,473
SO THAT HE'LL CONTINUE
TO COME BACK TO ME.

27
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,476
>> Jeff: MARTY DIDN'T APPROACH
CHASE BECAUSE HE WAS TOO CLOSE

28
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,977
WITH BRENDA AND JANE.

29
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,980
>> I WANTED TO SHOW THE GIRLS
THEY CAN TRUST ME,

30
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,150
AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GET ME
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

31
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,818
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

32
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,321
BRENDA AND SASH SQUASHED
MARTY'S PLAN...

33
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,114
MARTY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

34
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,657
...AND MARTY ALONG WITH HIM.

35
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,951
NOW BRENDA AND SASH HAVE
SO MUCH POWER

36
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,370
THAT EVERYONE IS LOOKING
OVER THEIR SHOULDER.

37
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,414
TEN ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

38
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:38,139
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL REALLY SHOWED
WHERE THE ALLEGIANCE REALLY IS.

39
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,685
BENRY, FABIO, AND DAN NOW SEE

40
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:47,023
THAT SASH AND I
AREN'T ON THEIR SIDE.

41
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,984
AND WE TOOK OUT
THEIR LITTLE LEADER MARTY.

42
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,195
AND NOW IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE THEY GO.

43
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,363
I'M GONNA GET A GOOD NIGHT'S
SLEEP TONIGHT.

44
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,281
>> OH, YEAH.

45
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,368
>> I THINK SASH AND I BEING
IN CONTROL

46
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,245
DOES LOOK LIKE A KING-
AND-QUEEN SITUATION.

47
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,039
BUT SASH IS MORE OF A QUEEN

48
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,416
AND I'M MORE OF A KING
IS THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.

49
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,071
>> I KNOW.

50
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,239
>> JANE AND I BOTH HAD
THE SAME FEELING:

51
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,409
BRENDA IS BASICALLY CALLING
ALL THE SHOTS.

52
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:44,873
SO WE ARE TOTALLY GONNA MAKE A
POWER MOVE BEFORE NEXT TRIBAL.

53
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,208
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT DO I HAVE TO LOSE?

54
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,921
SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE,
AND IT HAS TO CHANGE SOON.

55
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,869
♪ ♪

56
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,657
>> THIS RAIN IS BAD, MAN.

57
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,160
THE ELEMENTS OUT HERE
CAN REALLY GET YOU.

58
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,333
THIS MORNING, WE WOKE UP, AND IT
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GONNA RAIN.

59
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,001
WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

60
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,836
THAT THE FIRE
AT LEAST STAYS GOING.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,547
SO WE MOVED, LIKE, ALL OF THE
CHESTS AROUND THE FIRE

62
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,426
TO PROTECT IT FROM THE RAIN.
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

63
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,394
>> I GOT UP THREE TIMES IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

64
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:35,525
AND I WAS GONNA WAKE YOU UP,
AND THEN I DIDN'T.

65
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,568
>> I'VE COME A LONG WAY
IN THIS GAME.

66
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,613
DAY FIVE, I WAS READY TO LEAVE,

67
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,742
AND HERE I AM, SITTING HERE
WITH 14 DAYS LEFT.

68
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,705
I'M, LIKE, "MY GOSH.
I COULD REALLY KEEP GOING."

69
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,208
SO RIGHT NOW, JANE AND I, WE'RE
TRYING TO RALLY A VOTE

70
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,710
AGAINST BRENDA OR SASH.

71
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,837
>> WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,589
>> SASH AND BRENDA TOLD YOU GUYS
THEY WERE VOTING FOR JANE.

73
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,758
>> RIGHT.

74
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,011
>> AND THEY SWITCHED,
AND THEY VOTED FOR MARTY.

75
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,388
THEY ARE IN TOTAL CONTROL.

76
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,225
>> SASH JUST BACKSTABBED HIM
LAST NIGHT.

77
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,435
>> TERRIBLY!

78
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,519
>> TERRIBLY.

79
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,105
>> SO HOW CAN YOU TRUST BRENDA
AND SASH

80
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,523
WHEN WHAT THEY DID
AT TRIBAL LAST NIGHT?

81
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,942
>> I CAN'T.

82
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,444
>> EVERYBODY'S LISTENING
TO BRENDA, INCLUDING ME.

83
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,655
KELLY PURPLE CRAWLS UP
BRENDA'S ...

84
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,616
SHE DOES EXACTLY
WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO.

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,618
BRENDA IS ALSO ANOTHER THREAT

86
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,288
BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY GOOD
AT CHALLENGES.

87
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,915
AND SHE'S GONNA TAKE YOU GUYS
OUT ONE BY ONE.

88
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,208
>> HOLLY ABSOLUTELY GAVE ME

89
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,668
A LITTLE BIT OF A WAKE-UP CALL
THIS MORNING.

90
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,087
SHE'S GOT A GREAT PLAN,
ACTUALLY.

91
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,797
AND I'M ALL FOR IT, YOU KNOW?

92
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,758
GETTING RID OF SASH AND BRENDA
IS NUMBER ONE

93
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,593
ON MY LIST RIGHT NOW.

94
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:49,098
>> BRENDA'S THE QUEEN BEE
AND KNOWS THIS GAME IN AND OUT.

95
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,893
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN STUDYING
THIS FOREVER.

96
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,478
>> BRENDA IS PLAYING THIS GAME
SO WELL

97
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,397
TO WHERE SHE'S OVER-THINKING.

98
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,524
SHE'S MARTY, JR.

99
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,615
SHE'S BECOME A VILLAIN.

100
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,535
SHE BEFRIENDS YOU, AND THEN SHE
THROWS YOU TO THE WOLVES.

101
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,791
>> BRENDA, SHE'S LIKE MY BEST
FRIEND OUT HERE,

102
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,627
BUT DID I COME OUT HERE ALL THIS
WAY FROM SOUTH CENTRAL L.A.

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,462
TO GO BACK HOME WITH NOTHING?

104
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,466
NO. THIS IS A GAME.
AND BRENDA IS A THREAT.

105
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,135
SO RIGHT NOW, WHILE WE HAVE
EVERYBODY AGAINST HER,

106
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,513
NOW IS THE TIME TO GET HER OUT.

107
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,849
>> WE NEED TO SEE WHO WINS
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,

108
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,476
AND THEN WE NEED TO DECIDE.

109
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,478
BUT I THINK
WE'RE ALL IN A CONSENSUS

110
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,647
THAT BRENDA HAS TO GO FIRST.
SHE'S THE RINGLEADER.

111
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,691
>> THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE
CRAZY HERE AT CAMP.

112
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,818
THERE'S TWO ALLIANCES NOW,

113
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,488
AND I PERSONALLY THINK IT COULD
BE THE BEST INTEREST

114
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,823
TO VOTE BENRY OUT FIRST.

115
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,159
I STILL DON'T TRUST BENRY.
BENRY'S ON HIS LAST ROPE.

116
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,702
HE SCREWED UP
WHEN HE VOTED WITH MARTY,

117
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,163
PLUS HE'S A BIG PHYSICAL THREAT.

118
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,498
AND AS OF RIGHT NOW,

119
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,667
I DON'T THINK BRENDA AND SASH
HAVE LIED TO ME.

120
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,877
SO I'M STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF
TWO ALLIANCES AGAIN.

121
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,004
>> CHASE, YOU'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE ME ON THIS ONE.

122
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,132
SHE IS TOTALLY RUNNING THE SHOW.

123
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,348
>> I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.

124
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,559
CHASE WAS A LITTLE LEERY
ABOUT THE PLAN.

125
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,478
HE WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED
ABOUT BEN.

126
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,065
SO I'M KEEPING MY EYE ON CHASE
JUST BECAUSE CHASE,

127
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:21,774
I FEEL I CAN TRUST HIM,

128
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,776
BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,

129
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,904
HE MAKES ME
JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS.

130
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,622
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

131
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,256
GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?

132
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,299
>> ALL: YES.

133
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,425
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

134
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,760
YOU WILL BE DIVIDED
INTO TWO TEAMS OF FIVE.

135
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:55,099
USING ONLY FOUR BARRELS, TWO
PLANKS, AND TEN FEET OF ROPE,

136
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,353
YOU MUST WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE
YOUR WAY ACROSS THE BEACH

137
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,607
TO THE FINISHED PLATFORM
WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GROUND.

138
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,609
IF ANYBODY FROM YOUR TEAM
TOUCHES THE GROUND,

139
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,070
THE ENTIRE TEAM HAS
TO GO BACK TO THE START.

140
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,031
FIRST TEAM TO GET
ALL FIVE MEMBERS

141
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,574
TO THE FINISH PLATFORM
WIN REWARD.

142
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,534
WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?

143
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,869
>> ALL: YES!

144
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,205
>> Reporter: THE WINNING TEAM
WILL TRAVEL TO THE CERRO NEGRO,

145
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,248
ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE VOLCANOES
IN THE WORLD.

146
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,042
YOU'LL DO A LITTLE VOLCANO
BOARDING,

147
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,211
AND THEN YOU'LL AND ENJOY PIZZA,

148
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,214
SOFT DRINKS, CHOCOLATE BROWNIES.

149
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,256
(ALL GROAN)

150
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,758
>> OH, MY GOD, BABY.

151
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,759
>> Jeff: I KNOW IT'S WORTH
PLAYING FOR.

152
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,636
WE'LL DO A SCHOOLYARD PICK
TO GET OUR TEAMS.

153
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,764
WE'LL GET STARTED.

154
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:40,937
ON THE BLUE TEAM: CHASE, PURPLE
KELLY, JANE, NAONKA, AND FABIO.

155
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,942
ON THE YELLOW TEAM: SASH, HOLLY,
BRENDA, DAN, AND BENRY.

156
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,735
FOR REWARD. SURVIVORS READY?

157
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,820
GO!

158
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,783
YOU HAVE FOUR BARRELS,
TWO PLANKS OF WOOD,

159
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,284
AND TEN FEET OF ROPE.

160
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,119
WHAT YOU DO WITH IT
WILL DETERMINE

161
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,330
WHO WINS THIS CHALLENGE.

162
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:03,626
BOTH TEAMS OFF TO A GOOD START
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM,

163
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,921
WHAT'S GONNA BE THE KEY
TO MOVING THE ENTIRE TEAM

164
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:11,968
OF FIVE ACROSS THE BEACH WHEN
YOU CAN'T TOUCH THE GROUND?

165
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,636
>> STAY LOW, CHASE, STAY LOW.

166
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,638
STAY LOW.

167
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,806
>> KEEP IT CLOSE!
KEEP IT CLOSE!

168
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,683
>> ROLL THAT TO SASH.

169
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,477
>> PURPLE KELLY, CAN YOU REACH
THAT BARREL?

170
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,646
>> SEE IF YOU CAN GET YOUR FEET
BEHIND YOU.

171
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,106
>> WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?

172
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,691
>> Jeff: BLUE TEAM WANTS
THEIR LAST BARREL

173
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,692
AND CAN'T GET IT.

174
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,026
>> I DON'T THINK WE NEED IT.

175
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,152
>> I DON'T EITHER.

176
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,445
>> LET'S GO WITH IT.

177
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,780
>> Jeff: DAN, BATTLING
TWO BAD KNEES,

178
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,907
GONNA TRY TO GET UP
ON THIS BARREL.

179
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,536
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S
COMFORTABLE, BUT HE'S UP THERE.

180
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,704
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

181
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,832
BLUE TEAM HAS A SYSTEM
AND IT IS WORKING,

182
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,835
ONLY USING THREE
OF THEIR FOUR BARRELS.

183
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,129
YELLOW TEAM JUST WINGING IT.

184
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,465
A LITTLE CIRQUE DE SOLEIL GOING
ON WITH BENRY.

185
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,176
CHASE HAS A VERY GOOD STRATEGY
FOR THE BLUE TEAM.

186
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,470
>> LET'S DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

187
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,180
WE'RE GONNA LOSE
THAT FOURTH BARREL.

188
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,890
>> Jeff: BLUE TEAM WORKING
TOGETHER, VERY CALM.

189
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,684
YELLOW TEAM LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE IN PAIN,

190
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,229
CRUNCHED OVER, CONFUSED.

191
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,231
>> IT'S ROLLING! IT'S ROLLING!

192
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,858
>> Jeff: YELLOW TEAM,
EVERYBODY FALLS OFF.

193
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,818
EVERYBODY BACK TO THE START.

194
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,488
DAN IS HURT.

195
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,948
DAN SMASHED HIS HAND.

196
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,826
HUGE SETBACK
FOR THE YELLOW TEAM.

197
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,703
THE ONLY THING THE YELLOW TEAM
CAN HOPE FOR

198
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,040
IS A MISTAKE BY THE BLUE TEAM.

199
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,835
BRENDA TRYING TO ROLL
ON ONE OF THE BARRELS.

200
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,879
THAT'LL WORK, FOR A MINUTE.

201
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,007
>> HERE, PUT IT BETWEEN MY LEGS.

202
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,508
>> Jeff: YELLOW TEAM HAS MADE

203
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,801
VERY LITTLE PROGRESS
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

204
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,180
IF THIS WERE LIFE OR DEATH,
YOU'D BE DEAD.

205
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,556
(FABIO LAUGHS)

206
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,434
>> Y'ALL STAY FOCUSED.

207
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,395
>> Jeff: RAIN STARTING
TO COME DOWN NOW.

208
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,981
FABIO WILL BE FIRST
TO CROSS FOR THE BLUE TEAM.

209
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,233
>> DON'T JUMP! DON'T JUMP!
THAT ROLLS THE BARREL.

210
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,110
>> Jeff: BENRY STILL CAN'T
FIGURE IT OUT.

211
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:58,366
FABIO, PURPLE KELLY,
JANE, NAONKA,

212
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,118
AND CHASE WIN REWARD!

213
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,747
PIZZA, BROWNIES,
AND VOLCANO SURFING.

214
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,417
BENRY MAKES THE BEST MOVE IN THE
CHALLENGE FOR THE YELLOW TEAM

215
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:13,923
WITH THE CEREMONIAL LOSER
DISMOUNT.

216
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,092
>> MAN, WE WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE.

217
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,718
>> Jeff: BLUE TEAM,
CONGRATULATIONS.

218
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,428
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

219
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,638
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE
AFTERNOON

220
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,390
DOING A LITTLE VOLCANO BOARDING.

221
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,767
YOU WILL THEN ENJOY HOT PIZZA,
CHOCOLATE BROWNIES,

222
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,770
AND SOME SOFT DRINKS.

223
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,896
SOUND LIKE A FUN AFTERNOON?

224
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,481
>> YES!
>> YES!

225
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,774
>> Jeff: I FORGOT TO TELL YOU
HOW YOU'RE GETTING THERE,

226
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,775
BY HELICOPTER.

227
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,777
(\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\)

228
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,991
>> I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A
HELICOPTER!

229
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,664
>> I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A
HELICOPTER AND I NEVER THOUGHT

230
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,707
I'D EVEN HAVE A PASSPORT IN THIS
LIFETIME

231
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,418
LET ALONE BE IN A HELICOPTER.

232
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,337
I'M BLOWN AWAY, BLOWN AWAY.

233
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,347
>> OH, LOOK AT THIS!

234
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,932
>> CHECK THIS OUT!

235
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,434
>> THAT'S A VOLCANO WAY OVER
THERE.

236
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,017
LOOK AT THAT.

237
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,312
>> NO WAY!

238
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,857
FLYING UP TO THE VOLCANO, IT WAS
SO AWESOME.

239
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,650
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US REALLY
EXPECTED IT

240
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,152
TO BE THAT BE BEAUTIFUL.

241
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,156
THAT IS AMAZING.

242
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,994
>> WE LAND ON THIS HUMONGOUS
BLACK MOUNTAIN,

243
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,831
AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE YOU WERE
WALKING ON THE MOON.

244
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,709
YOU COULD SEE STEAM RISING UP,
AND YOU COULD JUST FEEL

245
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,043
THE HEAT COMING UP BETWEEN YOU
AND THE GROUND.

246
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,920
>> HOW ACTIVE DO YOU THINK THIS
THING IS?

247
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,173
>> ACTIVE.

248
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,092
>> AT THE CHALLENGE, JEFF HAD
MENTIONED VOLCANO SURFING

249
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,262
AS PART OF THE REWARD, SO WE'RE
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE CRUISING

250
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,014
DOWN THE SIDE OF THIS VOLCANO,
AND I'VE NEVER

251
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,849
EVEN HEARD OF THAT BEFORE.

252
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,018
THAT BLEW MY MIND, DUDE.

253
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,020
(indistinct yelling)

254
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,049
>> WOW, MAN!

255
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,051
>> DUDE!

256
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,094
>> THAT WAS CRAZY!

257
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,852
>> HEY, I'M HANGING WITH THE
KIDS NOW.

258
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,521
JUST BECAUSE I MAY BE A LITTLE
BIT OLDER THAN THEM,

259
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,439
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DO THIS.

260
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,483
>> LET'S GO, JANE!

261
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,452
>> GO, JANE!

262
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,496
>> YEAH!

263
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,917
>> THAT WAS FUN AS CRAP!

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,919
I LOVED IT.

265
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,088
I'VE RIDDEN ONE OF THOSE
ELECTRONIC BULLS, YOU KNOW,

266
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,423
AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE,
RIDING A LITTLE BULL.

267
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,009
IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE I'LL NEVER
FORGET.

268
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,637
>> WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK'S
GOING DOWN AT CAMP.

269
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,681
>> I DON'T CARE.

270
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,682
>> OH, MY GOD, GUYS.

271
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,726
OH, MY GOD.

272
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,187
>> OH, MY GOD.

273
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,188
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

274
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,189
>> EVERYTHING BURNED.

275
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,190
>> ALL OF IT?

276
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,650
>> OH, MY GOD!

277
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,154
>> OH, MY GOD.

278
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,196
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS.
I'M GOING TO CRY.

279
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,157
>> LOOK AT THE MACHETES.

280
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,785
>> HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

281
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,998
>> NOT ONLY DID WE LOSE REWARD
CHALLENGE, BUT WE JUST GOT BACK

282
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,127
TO CAMP, AND PRETTY MUCH OUR
ENTIRE CAMP JUST BURNED DOWN.

283
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,174
OH, MY GOD.

284
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,093
THIS IS UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE.

285
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:32,056
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THIS DAMN
FIRE GOING DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

286
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,059
WE LEFT AND IT WAS RAINING SO WE
CREATED A LITTLE BARRICADE

287
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:39,021
WITH OUR THREE CHESTS, WOODEN
CHESTS, ONE OF WHICH HAD

288
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,023
ALL THE REST OF OUR FOOD IN IT.

289
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,192
>> YOU GUYS, DID WE REALLY BUILD
THAT FIRE UP THAT BIG?

290
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,193
>> YEAH.

291
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,195
>> LOOK HOW HOT IT WAS.

292
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,821
LOOK HOW THE GLASS MELTED.

293
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,365
>> OH, MY GOD.

294
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,158
>> WE'RE LUCKY THE WHOLE THING
DIDN'T BURN DOWN.

295
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,951
>> WE LOST ALL OUR MACHETES.

296
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,161
ONLY THE BLADES ARE LEFT.

297
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,663
WE HAD OUR FLOUR.

298
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,705
WE HAD OUR MANGOS.

299
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,540
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TOMATOES
LEFT.

300
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,875
THERE WAS AN EGGPLANT LEFT.

301
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,377
THAT WAS ALL BURNED DOWN,

302
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,422
AND NOW WE HAVE 10 PEOPLE WITH A
CUP OF RICE A DAY.

303
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,131
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO
DO IT.

304
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,050
>> LOOK AT THE TARP.

305
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,718
IT MELTED.

306
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,220
>> THE TARP, WE CAN-- IT'S OKAY.

307
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,221
WE'LL JUST TURN IT AROUND.

308
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,015
>> THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

309
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,228
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

310
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,397
>> IT'S NOT WORTH GETTING UPSET
ABOUT.

311
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,732
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE
HAVE-- IT'S ALREADY DONE.

312
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,275
WE HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP.

313
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,318
>> SOMEONE SHOULD PROBABLY WAKE
ME UP

314
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,238
AND TELL ME THAT THIS DID NOT
HAPPEN.

315
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,074
I MEAN, I GUESS ALL WE CAN DO IS
WRANGLE

316
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,451
WHAT WE HAVE LEFT AND KEEP IT
GOING.

317
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,495
BUT THIS IS A DAY FROM HELL.

318
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,585
>> I'M GOING TO HAVE A PIECE OF
EVERYTHING ON THIS TABLE.

319
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,462
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

320
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,881
25 DAYS, I HAVEN'T HAD
CHOCOLATE.

321
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,718
REWARD WAS AWESOME!

322
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,719
WE PIGGED OUT.

323
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,264
AND I MEAN, EVERYBODY PUT STUFF
ON THEIR PLATE.

324
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,058
I WOLFED DOWN A BROWNIE RIGHT
OFF THE BAT.

325
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,103
THEN HIT THE BANANA BREAD AND
PIZZA.

326
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,231
AND THEN I SUCKED DOWN ABOUT
THREE GLASSES OF SODA.

327
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,151
I COULD HAVE CARED LESS WHAT
THEY'RE DOING BACK AT CAMP

328
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,155
BECAUSE THAT WAS HEAVEN.

329
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,322
>> WHO DO YOU ALL THINK IS
RUNNING THE SHOW?

330
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,242
>> THAT IS WHAT'S SO UNCLEAR

331
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,078
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY.

332
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,915
>> I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO GET
A CONSENSUS HOW WE'RE FEELING

333
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,125
AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE FEELING
BECAUSE IT'S GOING

334
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,836
TO MAKE TOMORROW EASIER.

335
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,841
>> COME HERE.
COME HERE.

336
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,509
>> WHY DID NAY TAKE HIM ASIDE.

337
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,510
>> NAY DOES THAT.

338
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,971
>> ON THE VOLCANO.

339
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:36,680
>> YOU NEVER TALK.

340
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,390
>> I KNOW, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

341
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,147
>> THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE,

342
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,148
BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

343
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,942
>> NO, THAT'S FOR REAL-FOR REAL.

344
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:49,651
>> THAT'S FOR REAL, THOUGH.

345
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,445
SHE'S SNEAKY AND SHE'S SITTING

346
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,488
SO COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW CAUSE
SHE'S JUST TRYING

347
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,072
TO PICK EVERYBODY OFF

348
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,284
>> NAONKA PULLS ME ASIDE AND
SAYS WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

349
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,453
WE CAN GET BRENDA OUT OF HERE.

350
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,038
SHE'S RUNNING THE SHOW.

351
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,664
AND I'M THINKING, THIS IS GREAT.

352
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,500
IT JUST FELL RIGHT INTO MY HANDS
AND I'M TOTALLY GOING

353
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,668
TO MILK IT FOR ALL IT'S WORTH,
YOU KNOW.

354
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,338
AND HOPEFULLY I CAN STAY UNDER
THE RADAR

355
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,297
AND SLITHER THROUGH THINGS.

356
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,841
>> LIKE, I WANT BRENDA GONE
TOMORROW.

357
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,052
SHE WOULDN'T SEE THIS BLIND SIDE
COMING AT ALL.

358
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,887
>> WE CAN'T LET HER HEAR ABOUT
IT.

359
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,430
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN SAYING
ANYTHING.

360
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,640
>> WHAT ABOUT CHASE?

361
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,808
>> WHAT ABOUT CHASE?

362
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,809
>> DOES HE WANT HER OUT?

363
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,726
>> HE'S SO SCATTER BRAINED.

364
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,312
>> IF YOU GUYS ARE IN, I'M GOING
TO DO IT.

365
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,522
>> I'M IN.
>> ALL RIGHT.

366
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,191
>> IN ORDER TO WIN THIS GAME,
YOU MUST MAKE POWER MOVES.

367
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,902
YOU CAN MAKE A BIG MOVE THAT CAN
SHIFT THE GAME

368
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,696
IN THE WHOLE OTHER DIRECTION,
BUT IF YOU MAKE A POWER MOVE,

369
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,908
YOU'RE MAKING A MOVE THAT WILL
PUSH YOU FORWARD, AND THE MORE

370
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:38,784
YOU KEEP MAKING THESE POWER
MOVES,

371
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,244
EVERYTHING'S JUST GOING TO FALL
IN LINE.

372
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,511
>> HOLLY'S FREAKING OUT.

373
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,514
>> SHE'S TRYING TO CHANGE THE
GAME UP RIGHT NOW.

374
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,516
>> OKAY.

375
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,225
>> WHEN I GOT BACK FROM THE
REWARD,

376
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,061
I WANTED TO TALK TO BRENDA.

377
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,522
I JUST DECIDED TO COME OUT AND
TELL HER, YOU KNOW, THE PLAN.

378
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,357
THAT THE OTHERS HAVE.

379
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,025
WELL, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

380
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,402
THERE'S THIS PLAN RIGHT NOW TO
TAKE YOU OUT.

381
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,572
>> OH, MY GOD.

382
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,447
>> IT'S HOLLY THAT'S
ORCHESTRATING IT.

383
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,575
HOLLY AND BEN, I THINK.

384
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,577
FOR WHATEVER REASON, I TRUST
BRENDA.

385
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,413
THAT'S ALL IT COMES DOWN TO IS I
TRUST HER AND I PUT MY GAME PLAN

386
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:29,585
IN HER AND, YOU KNOW, THERE IS
NO REASON OR RHYME.

387
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,920
IT'S JUST THE SIMPLE FACT THAT I
TRUST HER.

388
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,297
YOU KNOW, I'VE GONE WITH MY
HEART THIS ENTIRE GAME.

389
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,093
THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME TO TURN
AT THIS POINT AND BACKSTAB YOU.

390
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,429
THAT WOULD JUST MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE AN ASS.

391
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,722
>> COOL.

392
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,893
LUCKILY, I HAVE CHASE, WHO
TRUSTS ME 1,000%,

393
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,603
AND HE CAME AND TOLD ME THE
WHOLE PLAN.

394
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,438
IT IS A CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW.

395
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,481
BUT I STILL THINK THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING CRAZY

396
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,234
TO BEAT THEM.

397
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,236
LIKE, I'M NOT EVEN THAT
IMPRESSED.

398
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,117
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
BRENDA?

399
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,911
>> SHE'S SHADY RIGHT NOW.

400
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,121
AND SHE HAS TOO MUCH POWER RIGHT
NOW.

401
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:06,788
>> BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S MOST
IMPORTANT

402
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,373
TO GET BRENDA OUT RIGHT NOW.

403
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,208
I THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO
GET BENRY.

404
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,252
>> WHOA, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
BENRY.

405
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,087
I THINK IT SHOULD BE BRENDA.

406
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:14,463
>> DO YOU TRUST HOLLY?

407
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,632
>> FOR NOW.

408
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,382
>> I DON'T RIGHT NOW.

409
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,135
HOLLY AND BENRY HAVE PUT
TOGETHER

410
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,637
THIS PLAN TO VOTE OUT BRENDA
NEXT.

411
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,264
AND I TOLD BRENDA THAT.

412
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,474
>> CHASE HAS BEEN RUNNING AROUND
HERE LIKE A CHICKEN

413
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,352
WITH HIS HEAD CUT OFF, TELLING
PEOPLE'S GAME PLANS.

414
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,812
LATELY, HE'S BEEN SO SCATTER
BRAINED

415
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,981
AND SO NERVOUS THAT I HAVE TO
FLOP.

416
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,191
I HAVE TO BE SMART.

417
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,817
I HAVE TO GO WITH HOLLY AND
JANE.

418
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,777
I HAVE TO GO WITH THE PEOPLE WHO
WANT

419
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,819
TO GET THE STRONG PEOPLE OUT.

420
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,112
IT'S THE SMART THING TO DO.

421
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,074
WE CANNOT TRUST CHASE.

422
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,159
>> REALLY?
>> WE CAN'T.

423
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:47,454
AND I KNOW THAT'S MIND BLOWING
AND IT SOUND LIKE I'M (\BLEEP\).

424
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,122
DO NOT TRUST HIM.

425
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,874
HE'S PLAYING BOTH IN THE MIDDLE.

426
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,459
HE WANTS YOU OUT NEXT.

427
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,128
>> REALLY?
WHAT DO WE DO.

428
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,130
>> WE HAVE TO GET BRENDA OUT, WE
HAVE TO GET SASH OUT

429
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,465
AND THEN GET CHASE OUT.

430
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,134
>> SO YOU'RE IN ON THIS.

431
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,678
CHASE IS CRAZY.

432
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,805
HE'S BEEN PLAYING WITH MIS HEART
AND EMOTION

433
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,140
THIS ENTIRE GAME SINCE DAY TWO.

434
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,684
HE IS BEING PLAYED BY BRENDA.

435
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,229
HOPEFULLY CHASE WILL GROW A PAIR
AND REALIZE WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM.

436
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,480
>> CHASE IS TOTALLY
AGAINST GETTING

437
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,525
BRENDA OR SASH OUT.

438
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,861
>> YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

439
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,530
>> I AM SO-- JANE, LOOK AT ME.

440
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,406
I AM DEAD SERIOUS.

441
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,825
YOU CAN'T TRUST CHASE RIGHT NOW.

442
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,702
AND HE'S LIKE WIGGING OUT.

443
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,414
>> I ORIGINALLY TRUSTED CHASE,
BUT CHASE IS SUCKING UP

444
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,710
TO BRENDA LIKE HE WANTS TO GET
IN HER PANTS OR SOMETHING.

445
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,547
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF
MAGIC SPELL SHE'S CASTING OVER

446
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,176
CHASE RIGHT NOW, BUT IF THAT BIG
OLD COUNTRY BOY WANTS TO GO BACK

447
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,346
ON HIS WORD, HE'S GOING TO CATCH
HELL WHEN HE GETS BACK

448
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,850
TO CAROLINA BECAUSE CAROLINA
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT.

449
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,394
>> YOU CANNOT TRUST CHASE.

450
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,562
>> I TOLD YOU.

451
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,480
>> YOU CANNOT.

452
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,734
YOU JUST CAN'T.

453
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,901
>> I KNEW IT.

454
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,777
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR
BRENDA.

455
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,405
>> DOESN'T HE SEE THAT BRENDA
AND SASH

456
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,573
ARE IN TOTAL CHARGE OF THIS
GAME?

457
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,075
>> YEAH, HE SEES IT BUT HE'S
STUPID.

458
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,078
>> WHAT THE ...
IS WRONG WITH CHASE?

459
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,128
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

460
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,264
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO
TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

461
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,557
>> YES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

462
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,560
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
BRENDA, I'LL TAKE IT BACK.

463
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,604
THANK YOU.

464
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,569
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

465
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,571
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,
YOU'RE GOING TO STAND

466
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,991
ON A VERY SMALL PLATFORM
OVER THE WATER.

467
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,576
YOU'LL LEAN BACK
HOLDING ON TO A ROPE.

468
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,788
EVERY FIVE MINUTES,
YOU'LL MOVE YOUR HANDS

469
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,291
FURTHER DOWN THE ROPE,
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT.

470
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,959
WHEN YOU CAN'T
HOLD ON ANY LONGER,

471
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,129
YOU'LL FALL IN THE WATER,
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

472
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,632
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING
WINS IMMUNITY

473
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:10,180
AND IS GUARANTEED A 1-IN-9 SHOT
AT A MILLION DOLLARS.

474
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,265
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

475
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,267
WE'LL GET STARTED.

476
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,609
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY MOVE YOUR
HANDS DOWN TO THAT FIRST KNOT.

477
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,953
WE'RE LOOKING GOOD.

478
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,955
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

479
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,335
FOR IMMUNITY.

480
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,505
AND A SINGLE-DIGIT SHOT
AT A MILLION DOLLARS.

481
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:50,595
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT PUT
YOUR HANDS ABOVE THAT TOP KNOT.

482
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:58,145
>> AAHH!

483
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,689
>> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY
STRUGGLING.

484
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,566
SASH IS FIRST IN THE WATER.

485
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,026
SASH IS FIRST OUT.

486
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,821
FOLLOWED RIGHT BEHIND
BY PURPLE KELLY.

487
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,823
AND WE ARE DOWN TO EIGHT.

488
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,829
BRENDA NOW STRUGGLING A LITTLE.

489
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,677
HOLLY IN THE WATER.

490
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,679
HOLLY'S THIRD OUT.

491
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,769
DAN STRUGGLING
AND A NICE RECOVERY.

492
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,730
USING THOSE GUNS!

493
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,773
YOU WORKED HARD FOR THOSE GUNS!

494
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,746
BRENDA IS OUT.

495
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,003
DAN IS OUT.

496
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,717
FABIO'S HAD ENOUGH.

497
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,260
HE RELEASES.

498
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,055
WE ARE DOWN TO FOUR.

499
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,265
KEEP DIGGING.

500
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,559
YOU DO NOT WANT
TO GO HOME TONIGHT.

501
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,561
YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

502
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,775
WITHOUT IMMUNITY
AROUND YOUR NECK.

503
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,946
BENRY DIGGING DEEP.

504
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,906
NAONKA DROPS OUT.

505
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,783
WE ARE DOWN TO THREE NOW.

506
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,286
CHASE, JANE, AND BENRY.

507
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,621
LOOK AT THAT.

508
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,331
THE OLDEST WOMAN IN THIS GAME

509
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:45,293
GOING UP AGAINST TWO OF THE
YOUNGEST AND MOST FIT GUYS,

510
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,837
SHOWING NO SIGNS OF STRAIN.

511
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,630
>> WIN ONE FOR
THE OLD GUYS, JANIE.

512
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,631
>> I'M TRYING, BUDDY.

513
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,926
>> COME ON, HONEY.

514
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:57,639
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING
TO MOVE DOWN TO THE NEXT KNOT.

515
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,266
>> AARRGG!

516
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,268
AAHH!

517
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,064
>> Jeff: HERE WE GO.

518
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,441
YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS
TO GET THERE.

519
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,860
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

520
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:15,949
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

521
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:23,123
THERE WE GO.

522
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,874
YOU GUYS ARE DOING GREAT.

523
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,002
DIG DEEP.

524
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,713
RIGHT NOW, THINK ONLY ABOUT
HOLDING ON TO THIS ROPE.

525
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,840
DON'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

526
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,467
KEEP HOLDING ON.

527
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,012
AND WHEN YOU'RE TIRED,
FIND MORE STRENGTH.

528
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,346
FIND SOMETHING ELSE.

529
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,390
GO DEEPER.

530
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,192
BENRY IS OUT,
AND WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

531
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,193
>> GOOD JOB, BEN.

532
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,111
>> GOOD JOB, BENRY.

533
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,281
>> Jeff: WE ARE DOWN
TO CHASE AND JANE,

534
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,700
ARGUABLY THE MOST FIT
GUY OUT HERE

535
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,870
GOING AGAINST THE OLDEST WOMAN
IN THIS GAME.

536
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,621
A GREAT MATCH-UP.

537
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,706
>> OH, MY GOD.

538
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,875
>> HOWEVER YOU FEEL JANE,
BUT I'M STAYING ON HERE.

539
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:11,046
>> WELL, MY FINGERS ARE
ABOUT READY TO GO.

540
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,922
>> I'M PRETTY SECURE.

541
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,091
>> I'M GONNA LET GO.

542
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:15,925
>> Jeff: WHY ARE YOU
GOING TO LET GO?

543
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,678
>> MY FINGERS ARE CRAMPING.

544
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,220
>> COME ON, JANE.

545
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,847
>> Jeff: JANE, DIG.

546
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,390
DON'T YOU DARE GIVE UP
ON THIS CHALLENGE!

547
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,725
BOTH YOU GUYS.

548
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,560
YOU'VE DONE TOUGHER THAN THIS.

549
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,728
KEEP FIGHTING.

550
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,729
>> HANG IN THERE, JANE.

551
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,773
>> SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT AROUND.

552
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,219
CHASE IS OUT.

553
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,262
JANE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

554
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,555
>> GOOD JOB, JANE!

555
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,973
GOOD JOB.

556
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,935
>> Jeff: YOU EARNED
A LITTLE HELP.

557
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,561
>> OH, CRAZY.

558
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,938
>> I'M GLAD I LIFT
80-POUND DOGS.

559
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,773
>> GOOD WORK.

560
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,150
>> CRAZY.

561
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,736
>> Jeff: HOW CLOSE WERE YOU
TO FALLING OFF?

562
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,407
>> MY PINKIES WERE, LIKE,
CRUSHED.

563
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,783
>> Jeff:
YOU HUNG IN LONG ENOUGH

564
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,077
TO OUT-LAST CHASE,
IMMUNITY TONIGHT.

565
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,787
YOU'RE STILL SHAKING.

566
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,996
YOU WON'T BE SHAKING TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

567
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,290
YOU ARE SAFE TONIGHT.

568
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,501
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU,
SOMEBODY GOING HOME.

569
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,293
GET YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

570
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,963
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.
GOOD WORK.

571
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,507
>> MAN! I WANTED
TO WIN SO BAD!

572
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,300
AND TO GET BEAT BY JANE!

573
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,301
PROPS TO HER.

574
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,096
SHE'S GOT SOME SERIOUS
SUPERWOMAN STRENGTH

575
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,390
DEEP INSIDE OF HER.

576
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,981
(birds squawking)

577
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,316
>> OH.

578
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,444
>> GOOD JOB, JANE.
>> GOOD JOB, JANE.

579
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,571
>> THAT WAS A LOT HARDER
THAN IT LOOKED. >> A LOT HARDER.

580
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,492
>> WINNING IMMUNITY WAS GREAT.

581
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,619
I FEEL ON TOP OF THE WORLD
RIGHT NOW.

582
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,038
I KNEW IF IT WAS ANYTHING
PHYSICALLY

583
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:13,001
THAT HAD TO DO WITH MY HANDS,
I WOULD DO OKAY,

584
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,670
'CAUSE WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING A
DOG TRYING TO GO THEIR TOENAILS,

585
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,464
YOU'VE GOT
TO HAVE A REAL GOOD GRIP,

586
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,175
SO I'M REALLY HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

587
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,679
AND I THINK, UNLESS SHE ENDS UP
WITH AN IDOL AND PLAYS IT,

588
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,639
BRENDA WILL GO HOME.

589
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,641
(hooting)

590
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,028
>> OKAY. COOL.
SO WHO DO WE TARGET FIRST?

591
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,864
>> I MEAN, THEY'RE OUR THREATS.

592
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,990
WE SHOULD PROBABLY THINK

593
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,867
ABOUT TAKING ONE OF THEM OUT
NEXT, RIGHT?

594
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,870
>> YEAH, I MEAN, BENRY, RIGHT?
>> MM-HMM.

595
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,038
>> I THINK BENRY'S
THE BIGGEST THREAT AROUND HERE.

596
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,669
>> I SAY WE STICK WITH THAT.
>> OKAY.

597
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,047
>> I PERSONALLY THINK
WE SHOULD VOTE BENRY OUT FIRST.

598
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,424
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PLAY
THIS GAME WITH PEOPLE I TRUST,

599
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,550
AND RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T TRUST BENRY.

600
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,719
SO, I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT BRENDA,

601
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,347
BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS
TO DO IT.

602
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,519
(birds squawking)

603
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,361
>> HE DRIVES ME CRAZY.
>> HE DRIVES ME NUTS.

604
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,738
YESTERDAY HE PISSED ME OFF TO
THE HIGHEST POINT OF PISS-IVITY.

605
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,698
>> YEAH.
>> MM.

606
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,205
>> YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON? >> WHAT?

607
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,583
>> WE'RE TRYING
TO VOTE BRENDA OUT TONIGHT.

608
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,752
AND ME AND YOU COULD MAKE
A HUGE POWER MOVE.

609
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,588
AND IT'S GONNA BE SO EASY
TO GET PEOPLE TO TURN ON HER.

610
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,257
>> I KNOW. >> BECAUSE
THEY SEE HER AS A THREAT.

611
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,759
>> IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME
A FEW DAYS AGO,

612
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:48,930
I'D SAY THAT BRENDA HELD A LOT
OF CARDS IN THIS GAME.

613
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,933
BUT NOW,
TIDES HAVE TURNED A LITTLE BIT,

614
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,477
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN THE GAME

615
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,771
THAT I'M STARTING
TO WORRY A LITTLE BIT.

616
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:59,524
>> YOU'RE COMING TO ME STRAIGHT,
RIGHT? >> YEAH.

617
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,789
>> SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING?

618
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,624
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

619
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,252
'CAUSE I'VE TRIED TO...
I'VE SAT BACK AND NOT REALLY...

620
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,504
>> I JUST THINK BRENDA'S BEEN
THE RING LEADER.

621
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,131
>> SHE WAS THE RING LEADER
OVER AT YOUR CAMP. >> YEAH.

622
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,924
>> SHE'S THE RING LEADER HERE.
SHE'S JUST...

623
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,134
SHE'S GOT EVERYBODY ON HER LIST,

624
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,302
AND THAT'S HOW
THEY'RE GOING TO GO.

625
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,804
SO, THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

626
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,640
>> YEAH. I'VE BEEN PLAYING
THIS GAME WITH MY HEART

627
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,267
AND NOT MY HEAD A LOT
OF THE TIME,

628
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,645
AND IT ABSOLUTELY KILLS ME THAT
I MIGHT HAVE TO VOTE BRENDA OUT.

629
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,439
I DON'T TRUST BENRY.

630
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,816
I DON'T TRUST HOLLY
ALL THAT MUCH.

631
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:43,443
DAN-- I DON'T REALLY TRUST HIM.

632
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,028
NAY-- I DON'T TRUST HER ANYMORE.

633
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,237
SO, IF BRENDA'S GONE,

634
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,324
I'M PLAYING THE GAME WITH PEOPLE
THAT I DON'T REALLY TRUST.

635
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,034
THAT'S A...
THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT.

636
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:01,961
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE SAYING YOU.

637
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,173
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S
ANY NUMBERS TO SAVE YOU.

638
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,674
THE THING THAT CHANGED WAS NAY.

639
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,845
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
NAY'S NOT GONNA VOTE FOR ME.

640
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,513
>> NAY SWEARS
SHE'S VOTING FOR YOU.

641
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,515
NAY WAS... NAY'S THE ONE
THAT SCREWED IT UP.

642
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,018
IT SURE AS HELL WASN'T MY IDEA.

643
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,853
>> HMM.

644
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:22,106
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS OPERATION
TAKE-OUT-BRENDA IN PLACE.

645
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,901
I'M PRETTY ANNOYED ABOUT IT,

646
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,528
BUT I THINK
ALL I CAN DO IS STAY COOL.

647
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,906
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS
START SCRAMBLING.

648
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,699
IT JUST SHOWS
THAT YOU'RE DESPERATE.

649
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,160
SO, YOU KNOW,
IF I SHOW CONFIDENCE,

650
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,370
MY FRIENDS
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ME.

651
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,081
IT SHOWS THAT, YEAH, I KIND OF
WANT TO STICK WITH BRENDA.

652
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,209
>> TELL HER WHO MESSED
THE FIVE OF US FIRST?

653
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,669
>> NAONKA?
>> EXACTLY.

654
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,211
>> BUT HOW?

655
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,254
>> SHE WANTS YOU OUT.

656
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,882
>> I TRUSTED HER 1,000%.
>> ME, TOO.

657
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,258
>> BUT THEN, NOW WHAT?

658
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,094
NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO BE LOYAL TO YOU.

659
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,262
THEY SAW THE ALLIANCE, AND NOW
THEY'RE BREAKING IT, THOUGH,

660
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,224
SO, YOU THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE YOU?

661
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,570
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

662
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,572
MAYBE YOU BLINDSIDE THEM
WITH YOUR IMMUNITY IDOL.

663
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,407
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

664
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,075
BECAUSE IF I GET VOTED OUT
TONIGHT,

665
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,286
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN GET THE NUMBERS BACK.

666
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,581
>> THE IDOL IS DEFINITELY
SOMETHING TO BE USED

667
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,208
TO NOT ONLY TO PROTECT YOURSELF,

668
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,627
BUT ALSO SOMEONE
WITHIN YOUR ALLIANCE.

669
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,171
MY GOAL WOULD BE TO NEVER
HAVE TO USE IT AT ALL.

670
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:31,050
HOWEVER, AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THE MOMENT CAME UP

671
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,761
WHERE I NEEDED TO USE IT
TO SAVE BRENDA,

672
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:39,475
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER
VERY STRONGLY DOING THAT.

673
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,144
>> YOU DON'T THINK SASH IS GOING
TO GIVE BRENDA THE IDOL?

674
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,770
>> HELL, NO.

675
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,733
>> I'M JUST FURIOUS THAT NAONKA
WOULD MAKE SUCH A DUMB MOVE.

676
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,443
I THOUGHT
WE HAD A GREAT ALLIANCE.

677
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,945
I REALLY BELIEVED
THAT WE WOULD GO TO THE END.

678
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,448
BUT NOW I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE
NAONKA'S FACE.

679
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,783
I WANTED TO TAKE OUT BENRY,

680
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,953
BUT, HOPEFULLY, SASH IS GOING
TO GIVE ME HIS IMMUNITY IDOL,

681
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,205
AND WE BLINDSIDE NAONKA.

682
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,431
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING
IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

683
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,353
ALINA AND MARTY, VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

684
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,276
SASH, WERE YOU SURPRISED

685
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,195
AT THE LAST VOTE
WHEN MARTY WAS SENT HOME?

686
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,279
>> YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
WERE SURPRISED,

687
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,199
BUT SINCE
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,

688
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,201
THERE'S BEEN A LOT
OF RESHUFFLING IN THE TRIBE,

689
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,746
AND SO, I THINK
I'M MORE OUT OF THE LOOP NOW

690
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,998
THAN I'VE BEEN
SINCE THE GAME STARTED.

691
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,500
>> Jeff: REALLY?
>> UH-HUH.

692
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,876
>> Jeff:
CHASE, DO YOU BELIEVE

693
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,961
SASH BELIEVES
HE'S OUT OF THE LOOP?

694
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,130
>> I DO, BECAUSE
HE HAD A STRONG ALLIANCE,

695
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,341
AND NOW THAT STRONG ALLIANCE
SEEMS TO BE GO GONE.

696
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,844
>> Jeff: BRENDA, ANY REGRETS
OVER THE LAST VOTE?

697
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,346
>> YEAH. I DIDN'T WANT
TO VOTE MARTY.

698
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,308
ALL MY PEEPS KNOW IT,
BUT I HAD TO PROVE SOMETHING

699
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,519
TO PEOPLE
WHO WERE IN MY ALLIANCE

700
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,479
THAT THEY COULD TRUST ME.

701
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,357
>> Jeff: HOW HARD IS IT FOR YOU
TO TRUST PEOPLE OUT HERE?

702
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,192
>> NOT HARD.

703
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,777
I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THAT FROM THE START.

704
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,778
AND I THOUGHT

705
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,990
THAT THERE WAS
A REALLY STRONG CORE ALLIANCE,

706
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,867
THE STRONGEST ONE
IN THIS WHOLE GAME.

707
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,369
I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT.

708
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,830
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS

709
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,498
THERE'S A BREAK IN THE ALLIANCE

710
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,544
BECAUSE OF
NAONKA WANTING TO JUMP SHIP,

711
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,546
AND THIS IS
THE MOST SURPRISING THING

712
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,339
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT THESE GUYS RIGHT HERE.

713
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:38,719
MEANWHILE, SHE'S THE ONE
THAT WANTS TO GO.

714
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,056
>> Jeff: NAONKA, THAT'S A PRETTY
STRAIGHT-OUT ACCUSATION.

715
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,016
>> I DON'T THINK IT WAS ME, TO
BE HONEST WITH YOU. I THINK...

716
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,685
>> Jeff: HOLD ON.
YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS YOU?

717
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,603
>> IT WAS NOT ME, OKAY?

718
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,022
EVERYBODY COULD PUT IT ON ME,
BUT I'LL PUT IT LIKE THIS.

719
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,401
CHASE WAS RUNNING AROUND
YESTERDAY WITH HIS HEAD CUT OFF.

720
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,695
IT'S SOMETHING THAT CHASE DOES.

721
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,780
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
HE WAS PARANOID.

722
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,116
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE TELLING
BRENDA RIGHT NOW,

723
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,033
"IT WASN'T ME."

724
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,869
>> IT WAS NOT ME.
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT

725
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,037
TO FOLLOW YOUR INTUITION
IN THIS GAME, BUT...

726
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,289
>> CAN I GET IN ON THIS?
>> IT WAS NOT ME.

727
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,250
>> I DID GO TO BRENDA
BECAUSE I TRUSTED HER.

728
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,919
SO THIS IS NO NEW NEWS
TO ANYBODY.

729
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,422
>> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY,
WEIGH IN ON THIS.

730
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,883
GIVE US 20 YEARS OF WISDOM.

731
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,427
>> WELL, LET ME TELL YOU,
20 YEARS OF WISDOM.

732
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,554
I THINK THAT...

733
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:25,474
WELL, I THINK THAT
THIS IS THE FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL

734
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,268
I FELT COMPLETELY
OUT OF THE LOOP

735
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,103
ON WHAT'S GOING ON,
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST.

736
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,438
>> Jeff: HAVE YOU BEEN LEARNING
STUFF TONIGHT?

737
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,480
>> YES, COMPLETELY!

738
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,608
LIKE, MY WHOLE... MY...

739
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,984
THE WHEELS ARE TURNING
IN MY HEAD.

740
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:35,693
MY GAME PLAN, IT'S... I'M...

741
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,321
LIKE, THIS... IT'S ENLIGHTENING.

742
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:42,283
>> Jeff: SO, BRENDA, YOU'VE
HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING.

743
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,243
NOW WHERE DO YOU SIT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?

744
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,288
>> WHY WOULD SASH BREAK UP
THE BEST ALLIANCE HERE

745
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,624
'CAUSE HE'S SO SMART?

746
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,793
AND WHY WOULD CHASE LET ME IN
ON IT THE DAY BEFORE?

747
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,045
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

748
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,633
SO THEN, IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT
WAS NAONKA WANTING TO JUMP SHIP.

749
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,426
THAT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME.

750
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,137
>> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENS, SASH,
IF YOU BREAK TRUST IN THIS GAME?

751
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,847
WHAT DO YOU PUT AT RISK?

752
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,474
>> THAT YOU MAY GET SENT HOME.

753
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:10,353
I THINK THE PEOPLE HERE
THAT REALLY KNOW ME KNOW

754
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,480
THAT I AM TRUSTWORTHY,
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY

755
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,523
I MADE IT TO THE MERGE,
AND HOPEFULLY, THAT'S WHY

756
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,652
I'LL STICK AROUND
FOR ANOTHER TRIBAL COUNCIL.

757
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,947
>> Jeff: SO, BRENDA,
DID YOU SCRAMBLE THIS AFTERNOON?

758
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,324
>> I DID LITTLE THINGS
THAT I THINK WOULD HELP.

759
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,825
I KNEW THAT IF I HAD A CHANCE,

760
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,662
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WITH CHASE
AND WITH SASH,

761
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,288
AND IF I TALKED WITH BOTH
OF THEM,

762
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,165
TO MAKE THEM SEE, LIKE,
WHAT THE HELL?,

763
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,792
MAYBE THEY WOULD SWITCH.

764
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,169
THE REST IS, LIKE, "OKAY, YEAH,
THEY'LL VOTE FOR ME, WHATEVER."

765
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,171
BUT THAT WAS MY PLAN.

766
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,631
>> Jeff: SO, BRENDA,
YOU WOULD ARGUE

767
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,133
THAT YOU WERE TRYING
TO STAY IN THIS GAME, EVEN NOW.

768
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,052
>> JUST NOT SCRAMBLING, YEAH.

769
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,262
>> Jeff: WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THE WORD "SCRAMBLING?"

770
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,722
ARE YOU TOO PROUD FOR THAT WORD?

771
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,016
>> I THINK SO.
IT'S THE TRUTH.

772
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,352
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS,

773
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,145
AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY
TO DO THINGS.

774
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,107
>> Jeff: SO SCRAMBLING IS
BENEATH YOU?

775
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,109
>> IT'S JUST NOT MY STYLE.

776
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,362
>> IN MY OPINION, I THINK
IF PEOPLE SEE YOU SCRAMBLING,

777
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,198
THEY SEE YOU
AS IF YOU'VE ALREADY LOST.

778
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,741
"LOOK AT HER, SHE'S SCRAMBLING.
LOOK AT THAT.

779
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,534
ISN'T SHE FUNNY?
DON'T YOU FEEL BAD FOR HER?"

780
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,162
WHO CAN I REALLY CHANGE HERE?

781
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,498
IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE BEEN
TALKING TO THIS WHOLE TIME.

782
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,084
I TALK TO YOU ONE-ON-ONE,
I LOOK AT YOU IN THE EYE,

783
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,253
AND YOU KNOW THAT I'M REAL.

784
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,047
>> Jeff: SASH, YOU GOT
TO BE SHAKING IN YOUR BOOTS.

785
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,508
THIS IS DISASTROUS FOR ANYBODY
WHO HAD AN ALLIANCE.

786
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,176
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, THIS...

787
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,554
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BOMB JUST
DROPPED IN HERE AND BA-BOOM!

788
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,723
>> I THINK
SINCE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,

789
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,393
EVERYONE'S ALLIANCES
HAVE CHANGED A BIT.

790
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,688
AND PEOPLE HAVE A MUCH DIFFERENT
OUTLOOK IN THE GAME NOW

791
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,398
THAN THEY DID
JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

792
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,110
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO MAKE CHANGES ACCORDINGLY.

793
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,613
>> Jeff:
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE

794
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,741
THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES

795
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,451
ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES
TO KEEP YOURSELF IN THIS GAME.

796
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,703
LET'S SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT.

797
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,163
JANE,
YOU HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

798
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:52,455
I KNOW YOU'RE KEEPING IT.

799
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,582
>> YES.

800
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,916
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR JANE.

801
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,085
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

802
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,254
DAN, YOU'RE UP.

803
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,481
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE SCRAMBLED.

804
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,916
>> YOU ARE MY REAL, TRUE ENEMY,

805
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,335
AND I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

806
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,150
>> Jeff:
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

807
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,660
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL

808
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:17,164
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

809
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,679
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

810
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,305
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

811
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,474
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

812
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,476
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

813
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,730
FIRST VOTE-- BRENDA.

814
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,735
NAONKA.

815
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,619
BENRY. ONE VOTE BRENDA,
ONE VOTE BENRY, ONE VOTE NAONKA.

816
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,958
BRENDA.
THAT'S TWO VOTES BRENDA.

817
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,881
BRENDA.
THAT'S THREE VOTES BRENDA,

818
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,425
ONE VOTE BENRY, ONE VOTE NAONKA.

819
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,720
THAT'S FOUR VOTES BRENDA.

820
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,894
ELEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT

821
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,229
AND THE THIRD MEMBER
OF OUR JURY-- BRENDA.

822
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:22,938
THAT'S FIVE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

823
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,691
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

824
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,704
BRENDA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

825
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,751
>> Jeff:
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

826
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,056
WELL, IF THERE'S ONE THING
TO BE LEARNED IT'S THIS.

827
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,766
IF YOU WANT TO WIN THIS GAME
AND THE MILLION DOLLARS

828
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,144
THAT GOES WITH IT,
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR IT.

829
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,104
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

830
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,065
GOOD NIGHT.

831
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,994
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

832
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,292
>> Jeff:
NEXT TIME ON<i> SURVIVOR...</i>

833
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,920
NAONKA'S ANTICS HAVE THE TRIBE
IN AN UPROAR.

834
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,171
>> I WAS JUST SHOCKED

835
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,172
THAT NAONKA WOULD DO SOMETHING
SO STUPID.

836
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,133
>> NAONKA OBVIOUSLY WASN'T
THINKING STRAIGHT.

837
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,262
WE'VE GOT TO GET HER OUT NOW.

838
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,846
>> IF ONE OF THE GUYS HAD DONE
THAT, I WOULD HAVE TOLD THEM

839
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,101
TO JUST GET THE ... OUT OF HERE
AND DON'T COME BACK.

840
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,818
>> I'M STILL IN DISBELIEF,
REALLY, AT HOW OUTPLAYED I WAS

841
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,113
BY THE PERSON
THAT I TRUSTED THE MOST, NAONKA.

842
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,782
IT'S JUST FUNNY HOW THE GAME
CHANGED SO FAST FOR ME.

843
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,826
ONE DAY I WAS AT THE TOP,
AND NOW, I'M OUT.

844
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,161
IT WAS A CRAZY GAME

845
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,498
THAT I-I DIDN'T EXPECT WOULD END
SO SOON FOR ME,

846
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:05,624
BUT, UM, I AM KIND OF SAD
THAT IT'S OVER.
