>> JEFF PROBST: We are off the

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,263
coast of Panama on a remote

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,724
island that will play a dramatic

4
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,308
role in the lives of our 16

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,144
survivors over the next 39 days.

6
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:28,319
This is Exile Island.

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,113
Each week, at least one survivor

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,198
will be banished here, separated

9
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,241
from their tribe-- they'll have

10
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,702
no idea what's going on back at

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,327
camp-- and they'll be forced to

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,621
live on their own until they

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,374
return to the game.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,959
But there is a silver lining to

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,961
Exile Island: it's a mystery

16
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:45,462
that could help one of our

17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,881
survivors win the million

18
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,382
dollars and the title of sole

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,717
survivor.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,469
It's a twist like never before,

21
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,472
turning strategy on its head.

22
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,390
These 16 Americans have already

23
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,767
begun the adventure of a

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,102
lifetime.

25
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,687
They have been divided into four

26
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,231
tribes, each with four members.

27
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,566
They are strangers from

28
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,234
different walks of life, forced

29
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,819
to work together to create a new

30
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,446
society while battling the

31
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,115
elements and each other.

32
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,408
They must learn to adapt or

33
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,368
they'll be voted from the tribe.

34
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,328
In the end, only one will remain

35
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,205
to claim the million-dollar

36
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:24,292
prize.

37
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,629
39 days, 16 people, one...

38
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:32,175

Cirie, what do you think about

the way you've been divided?

46

First reaction.

it's sizing up to you?

I don't think this has ever

00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,234
happened before.

>> PROBST: Shane's right.

56
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,738
For the first time ever, you

57
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,740
have been divided into four

58
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,201
tribes by age and gender:

59
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,079
Younger men versus younger women

60
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,498
versus the older men versus the

61
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,875
older women.

62
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,252

team.

66
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,051
Why do they think I'm older?

67
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,052
Do I look older?

68
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,386
(older women laughing)

69
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,513
>> I would certainly prefer to

70
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,016
have some females on our team.

71
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,935
My personality, I can't help but

72
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,228
flirt with, you know, basically

73
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,605
any female I come into contact

74
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,815

charter member and president,

78
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,237
and then there was the<i> Love Boat</i>

79
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,280
crowd, which was the older men,

80
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,615
and there was the Golden Girls

81
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,033
and then there was the Spice

82
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:02,367
Girls.

83
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,743
It will be interesting to see

84
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,744

86
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,080
little bit about the island

87
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,081
you're on right now.

88
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,958
You will not be living here as

89
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,501
tribes, but over the next 39

90
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,920
days, many of you will be

91
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,005
spending some time out here

92
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,006
alone.

93
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,468
This is Exile Island.

94
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,844
Throughout this game, tribe

95
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,513
members will be banished to this

96
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,347
island, where you will have to

97
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,266
live with very meager supplies,

98
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,434
dealing with all the elements,

99
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,103
with nobody to watch your back.

100
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,521
And even worse, when you're on

101
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,272
Exile Island, you are not back

102
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,274
at your camp.

103
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,316
You are out of the loop and you

104
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,527
don't know what is going on.

105
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,405
Now I've got another surprise.

106
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,699
You're going to compete, right

107
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,284
now, in your first reward

108
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,286
challenge.

109
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:46,869
>> Yeah.

110
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,870
>> Let's get it on.

111
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,496
>> I was just pumped that we had

112
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,497
a challenge right off the bat.

113
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,332
I mean, that's my forte, that's

114
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,375
my thing.

115
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,376
I'm an athlete, you know, I'm

116
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,378
physical.

117
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,839
That's what I came here for.

118
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,965
>> PROBST: All right, each tribe

119
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,258
will choose one person to run

120
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:00,717
for them.

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,509
On my go, you will race to the

122
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,469
other end of the island, where

123
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,888
you will find a pile of skulls.

124
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,348
Taking one skull at a time,

125
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,767
smash it on a rock.

126
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,394
Inside, you'll find a tightly

127
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,312
wrapped ball of fabric.

128
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:13,563
Untie it.

129
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,815
You're looking for an amulet,

130
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,983
not a stone.

131
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,818
Once you find an amulet, race

132
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,069
back to the finish.

133
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,529
The first three tribe members

134
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,405
back with an amulet win, for

135
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,533
their tribe, fire in the form of

136
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,534
flint.

137
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,870
In addition, the losing tribe

138
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,206
will choose one person to stay

139
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,459
behind on Exile Island, right

140
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,878
off the bat.

141
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,879
>> (whistling): Wow.

142
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,005

>> Yeah.

144
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:40,298
>> Oh, yeah.

145
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:40,798
>> Definitely.

146
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,716
>> PROBST: All right, I know you

147
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,633
don't know each other very well,

148
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,718
but you got to make a decision.

149
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,635
I'll give you a second to

150
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,636
strategize.

151
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,471
Who is going to run?

152
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,890
(all talking indistinctly)

153
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,020
>> PROBST: All right.

154
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,313
Older Women, who's going to run

155
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,773
the challenge?

156
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,774
>> Ruth-Marie.

>> PROBST: Older guys, who's it

158
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,108
going to be?

159

>> Terry.

younger guys?

165
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,112

>> Let's go, Terry.

170
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,161
>> Look for the amulet.

171
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,746
Look for the amulet.

172
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,748
>> PROBST: For reward in the

173
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,540
form of fire.

174
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,877
Survivors ready.

175
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,878
Go!

176
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,504
(all shouting)

177
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,881
Austin down already.

178
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,717
Gotta get those jitters out.

179
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,454

180
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,497

181
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,041

the older guys.

Only two amulets remaining.

189
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,486

00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,076

191
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,077

00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,872
second amulet for the younger

194
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,415
guys.

195
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,708
>> My boy, that's my boy.

196
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,709
>> PROBST: Older women, younger

197
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,086
women, getting nervous?

198
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,462
Nobody wants to stay behind

199
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,964
here.

200
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,967
>> She's not a smasher.

201
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,348
>> God is gonna help her.

202
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:54,974
>> I just can't breathe until I

203
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,685
see her come up here.

204
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,400
>> Come on, Ruth, come on.

205
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,693
Come on, come on, come on, come

206
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,777
on, come on, come on, come on,

207
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,405
come on.

208
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,288
>> PROBST: Here comes the final

209
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,289
amulet.

210
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,291
I don't know who's got it.

211
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:20,833
>> Lord, please let it be

212
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,212
Ruth-Marie.

213
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,967
>> PROBST: Ruth-Marie back with

214
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,802
the final amulet for the older

215
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,012
women!

216
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,264
Older women, older men, younger

217
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,141
men all have amulets.

218
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,392
>> That's good, that's good,

219
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,354
that's great, you did it.

220
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,939
>> PROBST: Here she comes.

221
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,942
(applause)

222
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,656
For the young men, fire.

223
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,200
For the older guys, fire.

224
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,409
The older women-- Ruth-Marie.

225
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,410
>> Yay!

226
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,411
>> Whoo!

227
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,871
>> PROBST: For the younger

228
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,374
women, big disadvantage right

229
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,043
off the bat-- no fire, and the

230
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,670
worst news is you got to give me

231
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,129
a name now.

232
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:07,755
Who is going to stay behind at

233
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,509
Exile Island?

234
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,510
>> I'll stay.

235
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,135
>> Uh-uh.

236
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,263
>> You shouldn't have to.

237
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,639
>> I said, you know, "I lost the

238
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,182
challenge, I feel like I should

239
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,558
stay," and then the other girls

240
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,643
were like, "No, no, no, you

241
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,644
can't.

242
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,645
You just did the challenge."

243
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,271
You know, they were really cool

244
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:23,688
about it.

245
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,815
>> Should we, like, pick up

246
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,816
sticks or something?

247
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,900
Whoever gets the shortest?

248
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,443
>> Rock, paper, scissors?

249
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:29,902
>> That sounds great.

250
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,653
>> Can we do rock, paper,

251
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,654
scissors?

252
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,739
>> PROBST: You can do whatever

253
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,324
you want.

254
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,326
(talking indistinctly)

255
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:37,952
>> No one really wanted to make

256
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,538
a decision in our group.

257
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,163
The whole time I'm holding my

258
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,206
breath.

259
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,666
I'm thinking, "Please, God, I

260
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,085
don't want to start off<i> Survivor</i>

261
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,671
on the losing end."

262
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,133
>> One, two, three, hit-- ready?

263
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:52,758
>> All right, I'm here.

264
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,760
But, you know, I'm the one who

265
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,971
got stuck sitting on Exile

266
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,055
Island.

267
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,056
>> PROBST: Misty is sticking

268
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,307
behind.

269
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,308
>> I'm staying.

270
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,392
>> PROBST: Here's how it's going

271
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,393
to work.

272
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,436
You will stay here until the

273
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,020
first immunity challenge, at

274
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,272
which point, you will return

275
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,565
back to your tribe.

276
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,941
You will compete.

277
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,443
There's one other element to

278
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,902
Exile Island.

279
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,031
Hidden somewhere on this island

280
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:15,865
is an immunity idol.

281
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,866
>> Ooh-hoo.

282
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,743
>> PROBST: So while you're out

283
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,037
here trying to figure out how to

284
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,288
survive, you ought to be looking

285
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,039
for it.

286
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,957
If you find the idol, you can

287
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,958
share that information with

288
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:26,667
whoever you want.

289
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,127
You can keep it a secret.

290
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,253
It's up to you.

291
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:29,879
The important thing to remember

292
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,797
is that you can use it anytime,

293
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,675
up through the final four, but

294
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,218
once there are only three of you

295
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,054
remaining, the idol can be used

296
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:38,721
no more.

297
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,140
But here's the best part: you

298
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,892
can hold on to that idol until

299
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,394
after the votes have been

300
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,146
revealed at Tribal Council.

301
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,689
That means you could have enough

302
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,649
votes to get you voted out, you

303
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,360
hold up that idol, you are now

304
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,195
immune, and the person with the

305
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,449
next most votes goes home.

306
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,701
It is a huge shift in how this

307
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,870
game is played.

308
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,205
Along the way, you'll be given

309
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,998
clues as to the whereabouts of

310
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,625
that idol.

311
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,460
Younger Guys, get out of here.

312
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:09,794
Here's a map.

313
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,712
Let's go.

314
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,005
Older Guys, here's a map to your

315
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,423
beach.

316
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,216
>> Thank you.

317
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,008
>> PROBST: Have fun.

318
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,009
>> All righty.

319
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:17,718
>> PROBST: Older Women.

320
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,719
(whooping)

321
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,680
Sally, Danielle, Courtney,

322
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,183
here's a map to your beach.

323
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,935
The boat is waiting to take you

324
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,063
there.

325
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,530
All right, Misty.

326
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,114
Tough way to start the game.

327
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,865
A few minutes in, you're

328
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,117
already left on your own.

329
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,910
Here's what you have on Exile

330
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,246
Island: one machete, one bucket

331
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,247
of water.

332
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:46,872
Water not going to do you a lot

333
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,874
of get good, 'cause you really

334
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,376
need to boil it before you drink

335
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,002
it, and you don't have fire.

336
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,046
You also have a lot of time to

337
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,467
think about why fate chose you

338
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,052
to be the first one out here,

339
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,013
which is also why immunity is

340
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,723
already so important.

341
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,016
And as for your first clue to

342
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,601
the whereabouts, I've already

343
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,853
given it to you.

344
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,812
Good luck.

345
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,938
See you at the immunity

346
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,400
challenge.

347
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:32,918
>> Nice work out there, buddy.

348
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,753
>> Uh-huh!

349
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,965
(yelling like Tarzan)

350
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:38,382
>> Where's the map?

351
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,092
Who's got the map?

352
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,816
>> I am the first person exiled

353
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,153
to Exile Island.

354
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,196
I definitely feel very

355
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,198
vulnerable.

356
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,407
I didn't expect this, this

357
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,743
soon, this early, so it came as

358
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,076
quite a shock.

359
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,287
Think, Misty, think.

360
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,372
Jeff did say there's an immunity

361
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,291
idol on the island, and he left

362
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,293
me with clues.

363
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,294
He said, "Why did fate leave

364
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,587
you behind?"

365
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,547
Behind me.

366
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,757
It seems to me like he was

367
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,883
trying to tell us that the

368
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,051
immunity idol was buried behind

369
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,053
us, where we were standing.

370
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,891
That was my guess, anyways.

371
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,143
Behind me.

372
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,394
I'm going to be definitely

373
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,354
searching for that immunity

374
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,649
idol.

375
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,115
(laughter)

376
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:45,908
(whooping)

377
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,077
>> Oh, we have a machete!

378
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,370
>> We walked up to the flag.

379
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,038
There was a pot and a machete.

380
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,415
The machete kind of scared me a

381
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,583
little bit.

382
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,876
I thought we might have to clear

383
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,670
an area to build a house or

384
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,754
something.

385
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,548
And clearing areas kind of

386
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,590
scares me, because when you

387
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,258
clear the area, the things that

388
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,260
used to live there come out, and

389
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:10,975
I'm not good with things.

390
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,768
>> And bless our team.

391
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,853
Bless everyone here...

392
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,105
>> Amen.

393
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:16,939
>> Amen.

394
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,065
>> Amen.

395
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,942
(laughter)

396
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,527
(whooping)

397
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,778
>> To finally be at your beach

398
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:23,779
where your tribe flag is, is

399
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,780
huge, and then, of course, we're

400
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,781
like, "Where are we going to

401
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,782
build a shelter?

402
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:27,783
Where are we going to build a

403
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,784
fire?

404
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,785
Oh, my gosh, we've got to do

405
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:30,619
this.

406
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,453
We only have two hours of

407
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,121
daylight."

408
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:32,705
You know? So we went straight

409
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,374
into work mode.

410
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,375
>> Ooh, that's pretty cool

411
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,459
stuff.

412
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,295

00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,963

416
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,051
Okay, here we go, kids.

00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:46,969
More of that stuff.

418
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,887
Keep her going.

419
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,680
>> Good job!

420
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,347
>> Good job!

421
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,640
(whooping)

422
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,141
>> Keep more sticks, more

423
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,809
sticks.

424
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,810
>> People, I think that was a

425
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:55,686
fire in record time, thank you.

426
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,061
>> I'm serious.

427
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,063
>> Yes!

428
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:58,939
Well, starting a fire was highly

429
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,317
successful for us.

430
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,943
Once you hit that flint, holy

431
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
schnikes, it's like a Fourth of

432
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,821
July fireworks parade.

433
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,990
Sparks were going everywhere.

434
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,783

>> The Older Women are

438
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,167
performing very well.

439
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,960
Tina, who has the most

440
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,796
interesting background-- she's

441
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,007
actually a log roller-- she is a

442
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:31,513
very, very resourceful woman.

443
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,223
>> Water is ours!

444
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,434
>> And so with Tina stepping

445
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,518
forward into the leadership

446
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,895
position, I'm happy to step back

447
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,105
and be one of the worker bees.

448
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,525
(whimpering)

449
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,695
>> They're what?

450
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,781
You said something scared you.

451
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,409
>> There's a lot of scary stuff

452
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,118
around here, though.

453
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,371
>> I don't think Cirie has had

454
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,081
a lot of outdoor experience.

455
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,540
Heck, we went to gather leaves

456
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,958
to make a cushion for our bed

457
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,251
tonight, and she said she hates

458
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,337
leaves.

459
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,005
Did anyone tell her what show

460
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,382
she was going on?

461
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,508
I'm, like, thinking, "Leaves are

462
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,384
the least of your problem,

463
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,594
honey."

464
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,355
>> Oh, yeah, keep it to him.

465
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,398
>> Bam.

466
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,649
You better not strike out.

467
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,609
That would be a bum.

468
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,235
We haven't really prioritized

469
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,779
anything yet, and we got to

470
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,571
figure out how are we going to

471
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,572
get water, how are we going to

472
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,448
get fire, how are we going to

473
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,283
get shelter?

474
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,160
Put your left hand, like, an

475
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,370
inch over my left hand.

476
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,246
And they're all left hand?

477
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,039
Try to get it as close without

478
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:39,289
touching.

479
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,249
Now right hands.

480
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,543
Now, now, uh...

481
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,419
All right, we're going to leave

482
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,378
our hands here until you guys

483
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:44,878
start to feel something.

484
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,046
You tell me when you start to

485
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,257
feel a little bit of energy.

486
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,468
All right, so right now, I want

487
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,386
you guys just to think, right

488
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,220
now, what we're going to do.

489
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:53,762
We're going to make fire.

490
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,263
>> Okay.

491
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,014
>> Okay.

492
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:56,890
>> All right?

493
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:57,474
Seriously, just take a second,

494
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,269
stop and think about that.

495
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:04,982
You guys feel anything in your

496
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,860
hands?

497
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,652
All right?

498
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,653
>> Aras, uh, has definitely...

499
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,946
He's got a lot of ideas.

500
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,030
Some of them are kind of

501
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:12,990
harebrained, out of left field,

502
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,116
like doing medication to get

503
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,117
fire.

504
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,369
>> All right, we'll make a...

505
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,245
>> (laughing): Machete?

506
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:18,662
>> It's over there.

507
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,204
>> It's right...

508
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,956
>> And it's, like, so grandiose.

509
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,540
Like, and you just want to go,

510
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,291
"Okay, how are you going to do

511
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,209
that?"

512
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,169
Like, we need to worry about

513
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:25,794
basics.

514
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,837
>> Use that power in the hand.

515
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,838
You got it.

516
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,839
>> Brace yourself.

517
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,923
>> Think about this thing and

518
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,049
catching it. Okay.

519
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,970
(clanging)

520
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,222
>> Oh, my hand.

521
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,223
>> Keep the faith.

522
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,392
Keep the faith, fellas.

523
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,477
>> I mean, is there something

524
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,478
we're just missing?

525
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,437
Like some component of

526
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,980
fire-building that everybody is

527
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:45,981
going to be, like, "Those four

528
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:46,940
jackasses!"?

529
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,483
>> No, we're getting sparks.

530
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,943
>> Our tribe's just hysterical.

531
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,195
I mean, we all established

532
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,321
within two hours of being here,

533
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,448
when we didn't have a fire

534
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,450
going, and hopelessly building

535
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,285
this pathetic shelter...

536
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,453
(clicks tongue)

537
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,579
We don't have a clue what we

538
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,747
are doing.

539
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,499
(laughs)

540
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,917
That's the shelter right there,

541
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,834
gentlemen.

542
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,668
>> Look at that.

543
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,711
>> (chuckling): Yeah.

544
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,504
>> Where's Bob Vila when you

545
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,296
need him?

546
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,214
>> That is the sorriest shelter

547
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,215
I think we could have

548
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,216
possibly come up with.

549
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:12,883
>> Possibly.

550
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,884
>> Got to be proud of it.

551
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,885
First night, you know?

552
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,886
We wouldn't want to peak the

553
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:16,887
first night.

554
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,888
>> Let's just hope it doesn't

555
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,889
rain.

556
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,557
Right now, it's not.

557
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,559
(birds calling)

558
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,067
>> Oh, this is kind of cool,

559
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,527
too, this little... story.

560
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,986
>> We could do a lean-to.

561
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,362
>> Yeah.

562
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,447
We could... and it's flat.

563
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,326
>> Well, there are so many

564
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,410
places.

565
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,203
I don't know.

566
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:41,703
We should keep looking.

567
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,205
Don't you think?

568
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,456
>> What would Misty like?

569
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,083
(laughing): What would...

570
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,167
>> It hasn't been the greatest

571
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,293
day for us.

572
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,295
We started off, like, you know,

573
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,213
underdogs.

574
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,006
Plus, you know, since we didn't

575
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,424
win the flint and, everyone else

576
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,176
did, we don't have fire, and

577
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,177
don't have water.

578
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,929
And we only have three of us,

579
00:18:59,012 --> 00:18:59,888
so...

580
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,515
And none of us has ever made a

581
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,599
shelter before.

582
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,267
It's such a cool tree, huh?

583
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,435
It seems like we could do

584
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,603
something with this.

585
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,771
>> I don't know.

586
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,772
>> I don't know.

587
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,731
>> I'm-I'm not...

588
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,607
Are you feeling it?

589
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,441
>> No.

590
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,943
(laughter)

591
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,236
>> Nope... Next!

592
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,071
>> I'm just kidding.

593
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,531
>> We are so back-and-forth

594
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,324
about where to pick our shelter.

595
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,325
We were being women:

596
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,368
"Huh. Do you think this will

597
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,661
work?"

598
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,745
"I don't know.

599
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,496
What do you think?"

600
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,914
"I don't know.

601
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,331
Is purple my color?"

602
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,333
Hmm.

603
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,920
Uh...

604
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,921
>> Do you want to keep walking?

605
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,298
Other options?

606
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:34,882
>> I-I'm happy walking, just

607
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:35,507
checking out where we're living,

608
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,925
just for fun.

609
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,634
>> All right, let's check it

610
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,468
out.

611
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,595
I started to get a little bit

612
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,346
frustrated with the whole, like,

613
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,764
where we should do the shelter.

614
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,390
If you see it and you like it,

615
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,309
don't even look any more,

616
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:45,893
because it's just a waste of

617
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,393
time at that point.

618
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,896
It's starting to get dark.

619
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,522
>> Oh, man!

620
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,109
How old this guy is.

621
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,694
Oh, man!

622
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,947
Dead, on this little beach.

623
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,282
Come on.

624
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,368
That's-That's really weird, huh?

625
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,291
Oh, we love you.

626
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,876
I thought it was really ironic

627
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,836
that the turtle, that

628
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,837
represents, like, mother and

629
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,255
goddess and, like, Native

630
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:15,797
American culture, and, that

631
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,466
like, this is the island where

632
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,342
three women, you know, are

633
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,928
living on.

634
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,095
It just to me, it just seemed

635
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,056
really significant.

636
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,474
I mean, they're just, like, such

637
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,808
a symbol.

638
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,809
Like, the turtle is Mother

639
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,852
Earth.

640
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,478
Even more specifically, North

641
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,482
America is called Turtle Island.

642
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,026
>> Courtney's kind of just so

643
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,027
out there.

644
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,653
She had all this symbolism for a

645
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,321
dead sea turtle.

646
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,031
To me, it's just a turtle.

647
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,075
I cannot fake that I'm, like,

648
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,952
deep into this.

649
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,203
>> Should we just...

650
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,120
>> I don't... I don't know.

651
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:47,996
I'm thinking about high tide,

652
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,622
just, like, rolling her back in

653
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,166
the ocean or something.

654
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,210
>> Rolling it back in the ocean?

655
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:53,460
>> Yeah.

656
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,921
>> I think Courtney...

657
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,048
she overdramatizes things, I

658
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,591
believe, which is not needed.

659
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,051
We need to, you know,

660
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,095
build a shelter, catch food,

661
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,346
build a fire.

662
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,305
>> Oh, my gosh.

663
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,140
It just freaks me out, man.

664
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,517
>> There's so much to do and so

665
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,853
little time to do it.

666
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,736
(birds singing)

667
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,490
(grunting)

668
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,783
>> All right, Bruce.

669
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,703
(grunting)

670
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,037
>> Some I already cut.

671
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,956
>> Awesome!

672
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,540
>> We're feeling really good

673
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,709
because we got our fire and

674
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,252
boiling water.

675
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,336
You see any other smoke on any

676
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,504
of the other islands?

677
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,964
>> Let's make a rally up into

678
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,090
the thing and get some really

679
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,049
dry wood, 'cause we're putting

680
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:41,883
wet wood on the deal.

681
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,801
>> Okay.

682
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,677
>> We're stoked.

683
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,678
We're Older Guys, and we're

684
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,929
into this, and we're doing the

685
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,014
Boy Scout thing right now.

686
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:47,639
That's the best-smelling

687
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,932
stinking fire I've seen in a

688
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,934
long time.

689
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,227
When people come over here, if

690
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,520
they do, they're going to see a

691
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,563
roaring fire, and they're going

692
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,856
to see some shrimp on the

693
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,443
barbie.

694
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,403
>> Can I trust you?

695
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,571
>> Yeah.

696
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,032
Yeah.

697
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,033
>> I'll never lie to you.

698
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,034
>> Okay.

699
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,035
>> And I expect you to never lie

700
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,036
to me.

701
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,037
>> I'll shake on that.

702
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,038
>> Yeah?

703
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,039
>> Yeah.

704
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,123
>> All right, we'll never lie to

705
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:13,582
each other.

706
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,583
>> No matter what.

707
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:26,470
>> All right.

708
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,387
>> Really?

709
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,096
>> Yeah.

710
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,889
So...

711
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:29,723
>> That's awesome!

712
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,807
>> Yeah.

713
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,142
>> Well, I did do, do a little

714
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:32,893
white lie to you.

715
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,394
You know I am, you know, I'm an

716
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,395
American Airlines pilot...

717
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,396
>> Yeah.

718
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,397
>> ... but I-I didn't want

719
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:37,939
people knowing the military

720
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,274
thing.

721
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,859
Uh, yeah, I flew F-14s.

722
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,402
Aircraft carriers.

723
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:42,903
>> Terry's a great guy.

724
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,780
I found out he was a military

725
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,990
pilot, flew F-14s.

726
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:47,616
My background is that I retired

727
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,452
from NASA as an astronaut.

728
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:50,994
There are some similarities

729
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,704
between the expedition to space

730
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,247
and the expedition to a deserted

731
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,582
island.

732
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,501
The teamwork concept is very

733
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,587
much alive on this island.

734
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,550
>> By the way, I'm getting

735
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,469
chewed to death right now.

736
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,846
I don't know if they're in the

737
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,099
sand, but...

738
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,225
>> Let's get all these back

739
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,768
first, and don't waste a lot of

740
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,644
energy on one.

741
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,770
>> We're coming!

742
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,813
>> I already want to start

743
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,605
calling people out because

744
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,940
they're moronic.

745
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:20,232
>> Come on!

746
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,650
>> I'm with the older guys, so

747
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,943
the older guys, I don't really

748
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:23,568
fit in with them all that much,

749
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,780
and they just want to work all

750
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,365
the time, and I'm exhausted.

751
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,407
I haven't had a cigarette.

752
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,700
You know, I smoke three packs of

753
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,245
cigarettes a day for 20 years,

754
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,538
and I haven't had a cigarette in

755
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,623
like, 31 hours.

756
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,416
I mean, I'm just at the end of

757
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,126
my rope.

758
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:39,918
I'm fried.

759
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,837
Yo, man, we also got to stop

760
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,713
worrying about hurting people's

761
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,132
feelings at this point.

762
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:45,674
Like, we're here.

763
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,217
All four of us don't need to

764
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,759
get the water.

765
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,302
All four of us don't need to

766
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,595
head to the path to find the

767
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,638
mud chute.

768
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,347
>> You're right.

769
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,391
>> Like... I'm, we're all

770
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,642
capable.

771
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,351
>> You betcha.

772
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,352
>> (whistles)

773
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,521
Do you have the machete?

774
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,815
I left it there.

775
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,066
>> What's Daffy Duck doing over

776
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,192
there?

777
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,068
What's he doing over there?

778
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,070
I am not in a good spot, man.

779
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,655
I've got to get through this

780
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,656
detox for sure, the cigarette

781
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,199
stuff.

782
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,326
It's...

783
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,328
I can't lash out at anybody.

784
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,872
I can't, I can't, I can't.

785
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,415
It is unbelievably hard.

786
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,667
And I've been here a day.

787
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,711
>> Woo-hoo!

788
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,351
(thunder rumbling)

789
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:58,747
>> Spending the night on Exile

790
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,667
Island was my worst nightmare.

791
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,085
I'm tired.

792
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm hungry.

793
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,087
I'm really, really, really

794
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,173
thirsty.

795
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,635
Protein...

796
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,471
My tribe mates, the three of

797
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,722
them hopefully are doing better

798
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,098
than me, so they're strong for

799
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,058
our next immunity challenge.

800
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,851
But, uh, I definitely feel at a

801
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,853
huge disadvantage.

802
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,396
And I'm the first one voted off

803
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,232
should we not win.

804
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,691
So, I have been digging around,

805
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,236
because Jeff mentioned that

806
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,820
whoever finds the immunity idol

807
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,156
on Exile Island doesn't have to

808
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,573
tell anyone else.

809
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,867
Well, I think that's going to be

810
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,118
a huge advantage, and I

811
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,161
definitely want to use it.

812
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,704
So when I see my tribe mates at

813
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,622
the next immunity challenge,

814
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,666
I'll trick them into thinking

815
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:55,720
that I found the immunity idol.

816
00:25:55,804 --> 00:26:10,694
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

817
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,946
We'll now bring in Misty,

818
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,864
returning from her stay on Exile

819
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,950
Island.

820
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,705
>> How you guys doing?

821
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,415
>> How's it going?

822
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,708
>> PROBST: So, Misty, how's

823
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,209
Exile Island?

824
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,669
>> It's been lonely, but it has

825
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,712
its advantages.

826
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,713
>> PROBST: What advantages does

827
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,630
Exile Island have?

828
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,923
>> Well, you told us there was

829
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,216
an immunity idol in there, and

830
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,218
you told us where it was, so...

831
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,553
>> PROBST: So you spent a little

832
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,012
time looking for it.

833
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,141
>> Enough.

834
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,392
>> PROBST: Okay, well, in this

835
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,685
game, there is nothing more

836
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,770
powerful than what?

837
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,062
>> Immunity.

838
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,690
>> PROBST: Immunity.

839
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,567
This is what you're playing for.

840
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,067
>> Yeah, baby!

841
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:51,484
>> Yeah!

842
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,527
>> PROBST: This is the immunity

843
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,236
idol.

844
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,820
There are three pieces to it

845
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,448
because at today's challenge,

846
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,700
three tribes will win immunity.

847
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,826
The losing tribe goes to Tribal

848
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:00,869
Council tonight, the first

849
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,163
person will be voted out of this

850
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,414
game.

851
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,124
Today's challenge is going to

852
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,083
test you physically.

853
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:07,667
It is also going to test you

854
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,710
mentally.

855
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,754
Here's how it works: all four

856
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:11,671
tribe members will start on the

857
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,256
dock.

858
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,133
On my "go," climb up and over a

859
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,801
barrier, swim out to your raft.

860
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,970
The raft is attached to a clip

861
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,430
underwater.

862
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,556
Once you've released the raft,

863
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,099
start paddling to shore.

864
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,976
You'll then race up the beach

865
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,685
where you have to solve a

866
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,604
brainteaser.

867
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,980
Your goal at the brainteaser is

868
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,274
to release a metal ring from the

869
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:31,858
rope.

870
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,817
Buried in the sand is a diagram

871
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,986
to help you.

872
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,529
Your dilemma is whether you

873
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,113
choose spend the time digging

874
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,033
that diagram up or solving the

875
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,451
puzzle on your own.

876
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,786
Once you release the metal ring,

877
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,287
you'll toss the ring out,

878
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:44,871
retrieve a grappling hook.

879
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,915
When you pull on the grappling

880
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,124
hook it drops a flag.

881
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,001
The first three tribes to drop

882
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,711
their flag win immunity.

883
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,796
Losing tribe, Tribal Council.

884
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,631
Make sense?

885
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,090
>> Yeah.

886
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,132
>> PROBST: Swim out, we'll get

887
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,134
going.

888
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:58,802
Here we go, for immunity,

889
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:03,848
survivors ready!

890
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,810
Go!

891
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,896
Up and over, one at a time.

892
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:28,748
Everybody over.

893
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,917
Tina bringing it up for the

894
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,085
older women.

895
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:32,836
Now you've got to get down and

896
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,922
unhook those rafts.

897
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,972
>> Go!

898
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,432
>> PROBST: Older men are the

899
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,892
first ones free.

900
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,979
Younger women right behind.

901
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:00,989
>> Oh, my God.

902
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:01,990
>> PROBST: Older women cannot

903
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,828
get their rope released.

904
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,912
Younger guys having trouble

905
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:08,913
with their rope.

906
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,999
Older men having a little bit of

907
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,043
trouble paddling now.

908
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,130
Younger women staying calm.

909
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,843
The older women have released

910
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,597
their boat!

911
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,557
Younger guys still trying to get

912
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,975
that rope free.

913
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:29,976
Everybody following the lead of

914
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,772
the younger women.

915
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,940
Young guys in serious trouble.

916
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,110
Still cannot get it free.

917
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,278
They're swapping out.

918
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,363
Young women doing a good job.

919
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,491
Older men making progress.

920
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,577
Older women have it going on.

921
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,539
Younger guys have their rope

922
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,207
free.

923
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,957
All four tribes paddling to

924
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,752
shore.

925
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,377
>> Back, paddle back, backwards,

926
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,129
keep going backwards, you're

927
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,172
steering us.

928
00:29:59,255 --> 00:29:59,797
>> Got it.

929
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,965
>> PROBST: Young women are first

930
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,133
back to the beach.

931
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:02,842
Moving on to the brainteaser.

932
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,012
Older men, right behind.

933
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,932
Trying to free that metal ring.

934
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,975
>> Here we go guys, let's do

935
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,643
this.

936
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,727
>> PROBST: Both tribes are

937
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,353
putting two people on the puzzle

938
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,938
and two people digging.

939
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,231
>> Here, we've got to get the

940
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,357
green rope out from here.

941
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,650
>> Let's see if we can get

942
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,026
through this.

943
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,069
>> PROBST: The older women are

944
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,364
now in it.

945
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,907
Younger women have found the

946
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,283
diagram.

947
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,202
Young guys in serious trouble.

948
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,079
Younger women making progress.

949
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,248
Melinda watching them.

950
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,124
While Cirie, Ruth-Marie, and

951
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,376
Tina dig.

952
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,127
Younger guys finally in.

953
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,630
>> Hold on.

954
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,256
>> PROBST: Young guys are moving

955
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,341
on to the brainteaser.

956
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,301
>> This around, this around.

957
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,302
>> PROBST: Tina, Ruth-Marie,

958
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,887
Cirie still looking for the

959
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,888
diagram.

960
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,181
Melinda trying to get a clue,

961
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,516
not digging.

962
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,561
That could be costly.

963
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:59,649
Young women have figured it out!

964
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,067
Young women are close.

965
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,402
That could do it.

966
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,528
Yank on it.

967
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,572
They've got it.

968
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,574
Younger women have immunity!

969
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,032
>> All right!

970
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,451
>> Whoo!

971
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,035
>> PROBST: 12 people still out

972
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:11,995
here.

973
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,831
You just don't want to be last.

974
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:15,373
>> I got it!

975
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,957
I got it!

976
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,250
>> PROBST: Dan has the clue for

977
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,876
the older men.

978
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,211
Younger men have the diagram.

979
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,671
The older women have it.

980
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,213
>> Lift both rigs up, both

981
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,506
rigs up.

982
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,132
>> Hold it, let me look, let me

983
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,010
look.

984
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,636
>> PROBST: Austin's bleeding.

985
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,929
Nick is bleeding, and they're

986
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,266
nowhere closer.

987
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,060
>> It's out, it's out, it's out!

988
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,186
>> PROBST: Older men have their

989
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,813
ring free.

990
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,106
Catch that hook, and you've got

991
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:40,982
immunity.

992
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,358
Bruce hooks it on his first

993
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,444
shot!

994
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,946
Older men win immunity!

995
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,364
They are safe from Tribal

996
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,657
Council.

997
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,283
Down to two tribes, one immunity

998
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,285
left.

999
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,996
Older women, younger guys.

1000
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,497
>> This has to be straight.

1001
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,540
>> ...And up and over it.

1002
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,583
>> Look it, we're one twist

1003
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:58,791
away.

1004
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,126
>> Yeah, we've go it, we've got

1005
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:00,460
it, we got it!

1006
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,002
>> PROBST: The guys think

1007
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,171
they're making some progress.

1008
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,047
And they have.

1009
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,257
The guys have solved it.

1010
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,800
Older ladies, you better kick it

1011
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,801
into gear.

1012
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,594
This is about over.

1013
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,637
>> But look at this though,

1014
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,679
this is step number two.

1015
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,263
>> PROBST: You got to toss it

1016
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,973
over that grappling hook.

1017
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:14,974
No.

1018
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,059
Older women still in it.

1019
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,101
>> Go, keeping going, keep

1020
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,061
going.

1021
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,062
>> PROBST: Down to two tribes.

1022
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,063
Somebody going to Tribal

1023
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,064
Council.

1024
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,192
That could do it!

1025
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,110
Younger men win immunity!

1026
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,488
Older women going to Tribal

1027
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,113
Council.

1028
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,200
>> (cheering)

1029
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,037
>> PROBST: Young guys, I don't

1030
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,330
know how you pulled it out.

1031
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,331
You got immunity.

1032
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:42,251
Older guys, you've got immunity.

1033
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,836
Because the young women finished

1034
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,129
first, you get the bulk of the

1035
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:45,338
idol.

1036
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,173
Maybe it has a little more

1037
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,424
spiritual power.

1038
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,385
The older women came up short.

1039
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,969
Tribal Council tonight, one of

1040
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,513
the four of you going home.

1041
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,806
You have the afternoon to figure

1042
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,390
out who that's going to be.

1043
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,184
Head on back to camp.

1044
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,203
>> Tina, I'm thinking about

1045
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,079
getting water.

1046
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,123
>> Go ahead and get water.

1047
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,208
>> Are you good with that?

1048
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,543
>> Yeah. Water and wood in a

1049
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,044
minute.

1050
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,713
Well, we lost the challenge,

1051
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,172
and, uh, someone has to go home

1052
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:32,260
now... from our tribe.

1053
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,929
I'm really nervous.

1054
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,931
I don't feel like I'm the most

1055
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,057
physically fit person on the

1056
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,058
tribe.

1057
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,727
I don't want to be the first one

1058
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,185
to go home.

1059
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,437
>> Well, we're going to go get

1060
00:33:42,520 --> 00:34:07,253
water...

1061
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,422
>> (crying): I wrote this in the

1062
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,717
sand for my son.

1063
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,093
Charlie was killed in a car

1064
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,137
accident just around four and a

1065
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,015
half months ago.

1066
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,935
And he was just 16 years old...

1067
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,938
and he was my only child.

1068
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,232
I am sad...

1069
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,527
because I miss him.

1070
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,613
But I would like to keep that to

1071
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,324
myself for now.

1072
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,910
So, I will come and talk to him

1073
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,370
once in a while...

1074
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,248
alone.

1075
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,638
>> ...in any challenges?

1076
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,014
And she said, "Well, no."

1077
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,099
So, I mean...

1078
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,613
>> I don't like to say that I'm

1079
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,615
gunning for anyone, but I don't

1080
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,701
want to go home.

1081
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,995
So I'm going to try to get rid

1082
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:29,836
of the lumberjack lady.

1083
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,045
>> And I think Tina's starting

1084
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:31,671
to aggravate her, just a little

1085
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,255
bit.

1086
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,297
Because she was like, "I mean, I

1087
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,382
really like her, but she is kind

1088
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,176
of loud."

1089
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,762
>> Whoa!

1090
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,389
That's a fish.

1091
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,558
That thing is breathing.

1092
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,601
Oh, my God.

1093
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,936
Obviously, with the tide going

1094
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,478
out, he must've got caught

1095
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,563
here, and he's going to

1096
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,774
become... (screams)

1097
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,238
You little...

1098
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,490
Ow!

1099
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,284
He's a little son of a gun.

1100
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,165
Big one!

1101
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,083
>> Are you lying?

1102
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:09,417
>> I'm not.

1103
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,544
>> How did you catch a fish?

1104
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,336
>> With my bare hands.

1105
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,380
>> Oh, my...

1106
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,382
>> Are you lying?

1107
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,635
>> Oh, my gosh!

1108
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,887
>> Okay, now, um, how do we want

1109
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,138
to cook it?

1110
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:22,722
>> Don't we need to fry it?

1111
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,222
>> Yeah.

1112
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,223
>> I mean, skewer it.

1113
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,433
>> We can do it however you want

1114
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,435
to do it.

1115
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,477
>> There are a hundred reasons

1116
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,437
to keep Tina.

1117
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,438
She's a workhorse.

1118
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,106
She caught a fish today.

1119
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,690
I mean, honestly, there are a

1120
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,318
gazillion reasons to keep her.

1121
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,903
>> Let's go clean it.

1122
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,112
>> We're going to fry him up.

1123
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,780
>> I do think that Cirie's the

1124
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,533
weak link right now.

1125
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,951
>> Do you want to do it?

1126
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,536
Go ahead and do it.

1127
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,246
>> That's a big fish, you guys.

1128
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,372
>> Slippery sucker.

1129
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,833
I scaled the fish.

1130
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,459
It's almost like everything that

1131
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,630
I do is kind of like to ensure

1132
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,422
to Ruth-Marie and Melinda that

1133
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,507
we'll be okay without the

1134
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,176
lumberjack lady.

1135
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:29,538
And I hope it's working out.

1136
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,957
>> PROBST: Behind each of you is

1137
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,958
a torch.

1138
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:32,500
Go ahead and grab a torch

1139
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,919
and approach the flame,

1140
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,964
dip it in and get fire.

1141
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,423
This is part of the ritual at

1142
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,050
Tribal Council because, in this

1143
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,761
game, fire represents your life:

1144
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,179
as long as you have it, you're

1145
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:45,763
still in the game; when your

1146
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:49,392
fire's gone, so are you.

1147
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:53,354
Take a seat.

1148
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,564
Well, welcome to Tribal Council.

1149
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,399
Not where you want to be.

1150
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,693
Melinda, been out here three

1151
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,819
days.

1152
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,112
Tougher than you thought?

1153
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,072
Less tough than you expected?

1154
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,490
No, I would say that I'm

1155
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,409
currently in Panamanian Hell,

1156
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,244
right about now.

1157
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,370
I mean, this is, by far, the

1158
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:09,912
hardest thing that I've ever

1159
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,831
done in my entire life.

1160
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,999
And it's because it's

1161
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,291
all-encompassing.

1162
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,793
It's mentally, physically,

1163
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,420
emotionally, spiritually,

1164
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,337
I mean, that's why it's so

1165
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,589
difficult.

1166
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,799
You should try it.

1167
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,883
>> PROBST: It that right, Cirie?

1168
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,634
>> Absolutely.

1169
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,927
I've never lived outdoors.

1170
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,929
I've never even slept outdoors.

1171
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,347
So, for the people at home that

1172
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,100
are like me, on the couch, stay

1173
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,768
on the couch.

1174
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,729
(laughter)

1175
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,855
>> I completely agree.

1176
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,940
>> Seriously, it's totally crazy

1177
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,942
to me.

1178
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,527
But now that I'm here, I want to

1179
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,530
do more.

1180
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,364
>> PROBST: How you doing, Tina?

1181
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,575
>> I think I'm doing well.

1182
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,035
I think it's been exciting to be

1183
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,119
out there.

1184
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:50,745
And I knew it was going to be

1185
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,204
very difficult, but, um, I'm

1186
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,290
pretty confident in what I know

1187
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,416
how to do.

1188
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,209
And I've been living outdoors

1189
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,753
all my life.

1190
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,296
Ruth-Marie, that's got to be

1191
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,589
a little comforting to have

1192
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,465
somebody on your tribe who feels

1193
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,425
very comfortable in the

1194
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,468
outdoors.

1195
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:05,843
>> Very much so.

1196
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,428
It's been wonderful.

1197
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,513
We have someone who had those

1198
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,514
abilities and took charge.

1199
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,599
And I think we did a good job

1200
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,810
of saying, you know, let her

1201
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,519
take the ball, run with it, and

1202
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,440
we'll try to fill in the gaps.

1203
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,107
>> PROBST: Cirie, it's starting

1204
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,525
to sound like, in some ways,

1205
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,486
Tina is leading you through

1206
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,029
these first three days.

1207
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:25,571
>> Yeah, you can say that.

1208
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,157
She... kind of took that

1209
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,158
position.

1210
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,618
She did know how to start the

1211
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,036
fire.

1212
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,996
Um, she found the water.

1213
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,622
>> PROBST: Those are two huge

1214
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,874
things.

1215
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,250
Starting fire and finding

1216
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,127
the water are gigantic.

1217
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:40,753
>> Well, if Tina didn't find the

1218
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,797
water, I'm sure one of the three

1219
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,381
of us could have found the

1220
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,758
water; and I believe we can

1221
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,134
start fire.

1222
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,552
She just stepped up and started

1223
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,678
doing things, so, I mean,

1224
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,263
what do you do, break her arm,

1225
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,306
don't do that, don't start

1226
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,307
the fire?

1227
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,351
Don't go fish?

1228
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:55,935
>> TINA: Do you think these

1229
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,436
other three are pulling their

1230
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,646
weight?

1231
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,231
>> Um, not as much as I would

1232
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,774
like to.

1233
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,442
I have a really huge work ethic.

1234
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,069
But I feel like if I keep

1235
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,113
saying, let's get more firewood,

1236
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,280
let's go find a fishing spot,

1237
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,573
they're going to look at me as

1238
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,075
a bigger leader than I am, and

1239
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,284
then my head's on the chopping

1240
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,327
block.

1241
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,870
So I just go out by myself and

1242
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,372
work hard and have a good life.

1243
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,456
>> PROBST: Melinda, any

1244
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,749
disagreement on that?

1245
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,875
>> Um, no offense to Tina,

1246
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,335
because she really has been out

1247
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:22,002
there working, but it's not like

1248
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,712
she's out there working and the

1249
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,297
three of us are taking a nap.

1250
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,590
I mean, all four of us are

1251
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,259
constantly doing something.

1252
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,635
It's just that we might not be

1253
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,678
doing the same thing Tina's

1254
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,097
doing.

1255
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,306
>> PROBST: Okay, well, three

1256
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,975
days in, only four people;

1257
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:36,976
sadly, there is very little room

1258
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:37,977
to hide.

1259
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,395
One of the four of you is about

1260
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,604
to go home.

1261
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,021
It is time to vote.

1262
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,316
Melinda, you're up.

1263
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,040
>> I wish I could've learned

1264
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,168
more about you.

1265
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,379
We just didn't click.

1266
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:18,392
>> Somebody has to go, and your

1267
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,227
fear of leaves was my biggest

1268
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,146
factor because we have to go in

1269
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,940
the leaves too.

1270
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,031
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1271
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,450
votes.

1272
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,917
Once the votes are read, the

1273
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,418
decision is final.

1274
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:45,586
The person voted out will be

1275
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,670
asked to leave the Tribal

1276
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,422
Council area immediately.

1277
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:49,673
I'll read the votes.

1278
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,721
First vote: Tina.

1279
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,390
Cirie.

1280
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,435
One vote Tina, one vote Cirie.

1281
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,440
Tina.

1282
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,525
Two votes Tina, one vote Cirie,

1283
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,569
one vote left.

1284
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:14,949
First person voted out of

1285
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,910
<i>Survivor: Exile Island.</i>

1286
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,078
Tina, would you bring my your

1287
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,538
torch.

1288
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,092
Tina, your tribe has spoken.

1289
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,553
Time for you to go.

1290
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,764
>> Have fun.

1291
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,025
>> PROBST: Well, you're only

1292
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,027
three days in to what all of you

1293
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,737
have agreed is already the

1294
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,322
toughest thing you've ever done,

1295
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,824
and yet, you vote out the one

1296
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,284
person who could make your life

1297
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,952
a little easier.

1298
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,995
Be interesting to see how it

1299
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:01,996
plays out.

1300
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,997
Grab your torches, head back to

1301
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,998
camp.

1302
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:08,836
Good night.

A twist on Exile Island raises

the stakes.

1312
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,229

be doing this.

1317
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,568

1318

>> This place breeds bad luck.

1322
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,284
(thunder crashes)

1323
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,123
>> I think the girls made a huge

1324
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,916
mistake, voting me out.

1325
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,709
I hope they do terribly.

1326
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,337
Working hard is what I do, and I

1327
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,880
think it worked against me on

1328
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,257
this one, but I would not have

1329
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,260
been able to change a thing,

1330
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:58,886
'cause that's just who I am.

1331
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,679
That was really a great

1332
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:00,971
experience.

1333
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:01,764
I have no regrets.

1334
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,767
I was just with the wrong girls.
