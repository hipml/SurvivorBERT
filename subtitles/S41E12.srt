169
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,948
like, heroes
that look like them.

170
00:06:56,015 --> 00:07:00,119
<i>It's like a moral dilemma</i>
<i>that I think everybody faces,</i>

171
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,421
but, like,
Deshawn was just the first one

172
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,956
brave enough to talk about it.

173
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,526
It's not just about color

174
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,728
and just about gender
and just about...

175
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,630
Like, it goes...
it goes deeper than that.

176
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,165
In this game,
it goes deeper than that.

177
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:16,068
<i>This experience has been</i>
<i>truly a beautiful mess becaue</i>

178
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,805
the mess came, but the beauty
is-is on the rise,

179
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,207
and-and I see the... the meaning

180
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,642
in everything
that's happened so far.

181
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,443
So I'm-I'm thankful.

182
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,224
All right, day 22.

183
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,393
Ready to get
to today's reward challenge?

184
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,394
-Yep.
-Sure.
-ERIKA: Yep.

185
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,595
For today's challenge,

186
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,596
<i>you're gonna be divided</i>

187
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,364
<i>into two teams of three.</i>

188
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:50,203
<i>On my go, one player from each</i>
<i>team will leap off the net ramp,</i>

189
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,338
<i>dive down,</i>
<i>and release a set of buoys.</i>

190
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,207
<i>You'll bring one to the finish.</i>

191
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,741
<i>Then the next person goes.</i>

192
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,643
<i>Once you have all</i>
<i>three buoys here,</i>

193
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,214
<i>you'll attempt to land them..</i>
<i>in three baskets.</i>

194
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,351
First team
to finish wins reward.

195
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,353
-Want to know
what you're playing for?
-(all assent)

196
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,522
Today, the winning team
will have their choice.

197
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,124
You can enjoy
grilled chicken and veggies,

198
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,995
or cake, cookies and candy.

199
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,865
-Worth playing for?
-XANDER: Yeah.
-ERIKA: Yeah.

200
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,934
Um, I mean, yeah,
I don't need either of them.

201
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,937
I thought we were gonna come in,
and maybe you'd say like,

202
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,806
a letter, family letter
or something like that.

203
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,474
-Ugh.
-PROBST: Every other day,

204
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,978
it's, "No rice? No food?
What is this?<i> Survivor?"</i>

205
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,181
Today I said you get a choice--
chicken and veggies,

206
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,583
which will just fuel you
for the immunity challenge,

207
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,051
or if you really have
a craving for sugar,

208
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,519
you can have that, and you say

209
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,488
-you want a loved one letter.
-Yeah.

210
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,323
PROBST:
I can't figure it out.

211
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,392
All right, let's do it.

212
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,564
All right, going for blue,
it is Ricard,

213
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,633
Heather and Danny.

214
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,870
Going for yellow--
Erika, Deshawn and Xander.

215
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,474
Deshawn's hoping for a miracle
letter from home to drop

216
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,509
-from the sky.
-(laughter)

217
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,411
Survivors ready.

218
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,314
Go.

219
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,316
It's Danny and Xander
in the water first.

220
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,985
They have the biggest job

221
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,955
because they have to dive down
and release the buoys.

222
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,227
Danny's gonna be off first...
with an awkward leap.

223
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,196
Xander with a nice dive.

224
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,403
And releases the buoys
and comes up. Danny dives down.

225
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,407
He's got it.
Now you're looking

226
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,575
for one buoy,
light blue or yellow.

227
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,381
You got to bring it back
and get it in your basket

228
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,618
and get on the platform
before the next person can go.

229
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,089
Go, yellow!
It's Deshawn in the water.

230
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,624
Go, blue!

231
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,993
It's Ricard in the water.

232
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,795
Deshawn struggling up that net.

233
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,764
Nothing is easy on day 22.

234
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,299
Hit it, Deshawn.

235
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,001
That's how you do it.

236
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,135
Ricard's in the water.

237
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,904
DANNY:
There you go.

238
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,908
Deshawn working it.

239
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,943
Ricard's got his buoy.

240
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,511
You got to get up there
and get it in that basket.

241
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,714
Danny, you could help with that.

242
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,316
Go, blue!

243
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,051
It's Heather in the water.

244
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,055
Deshawn completely fatigued.

245
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,158
Go, yellow!
It's Erika in the water now.

246
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,693
XANDER:
You got it, Erika!

247
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,595
RICARD:
Good job, Heather!

248
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,665
PROBST:
Look at Heather on day 22.
Still fighting.

249
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,200
-RICARD: Look at that, Heather!
-DANNY: There you go.

250
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,602
Heather's in the water.

251
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,705
Here comes Erika. She's in the
water, and we got a challenge.

252
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,973
DESHAWN:
You got it, Erika.

253
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,210
PROBST:
Erika has her buoy.

254
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,748
-Heather reaches her buoy.
-XANDER: You got it, Erika.

255
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,915
Now you got to get back
to the platform.

256
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,885
Every second counts in
these challenges.

257
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,353
Help her up.

258
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,688
Heather's just got to get up.

259
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,023
Ricard gonna give her a hand.

260
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,191
-Yes.
-You're good, blue.

261
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,093
You're good, yellow.

262
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,799
It's Ricard and Heather
retrieving for blue,

263
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,770
and it's Xander and Erika
retrieving for yellow.

264
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,040
You've got one buoy at a time.
You got to retrieve that buoy.

265
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,776
-It is Danny shooting for blue.
-Ah.

266
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,512
Deshawn shooting for yellow.

267
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,846
-Deshawn nails the first.
-That-a-boy, Deshawn.

268
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,981
Yellow in the lead with one.

269
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,449
Danny now feeling the pressure.

270
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,718
-(grunts)
-HEATHER: It's all right.

271
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,820
Deshawn going for two.

272
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:28,687
Just misses.
Danny short again.

273
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,992
PROBST:
Blue trying to make a switch.

274
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,294
Ricard's gonna come in.
Danny's in the water now.

275
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,663
Ricard's gonna give it a go.

276
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,434
Heather getting out
of the water now.

277
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,935
What's happening with blue?

278
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,371
-Ah.
-PROBST: Heather gonna wait.

279
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,907
It's gonna be one person in
the water while Ricard shoots.

280
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,942
-Yeah!
-And he nails it

281
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,243
-with his first shot.
-DANNY: There you go.

282
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,846
We are tied one-one.

283
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,683
Deshawn just misses
with the second.

284
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,219
Ricard with his second shot.

285
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,089
Just misses,
but now nobody to rebound.

286
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,690
DANNY:
Oh, you got it.

287
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,593
That buoy is floating
a long ways away.

288
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,898
-Oh!
-A very interesting
and confusing strategy by blue.

289
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,669
Can only be explained
by absolute exhaustion.

290
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,704
Deshawn, is that it?

291
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,639
Yes, it is!
That is two for yellow.

292
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,842
-There you go.
-PROBST: Ricard,

293
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,777
-just short.
-HEATHER: Oh, come on, so close!

294
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,679
Deshawn for the win.

295
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,880
-And he's got it!
-(Erika screams)

296
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,615
-Deshawn...
-ERIKA: Yes!

297
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,218
-...Erika and Xander win.
-Thank you guys so much.

298
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,953
Yes.

299
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,056
All right,
Erika, Deshawn, Xander,

300
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,291
you have a big decision to make.
You have a choice.

301
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,694
You can either have what
some would say would be fuel.

302
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,529
That's chicken and veggies.

303
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:48,734
Or if you got a craving,
cake, cookies, candy.

304
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,302
-We... yeah.
-We should fuel ourselves,
you know?

305
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,770
-Yeah, we need the protein.
-Yeah, we need the protein.

306
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,372
-So, let's do the chicken
and veggies.
-All right.

307
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,875
Chicken and veggies will be
waiting for you back at camp.

308
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,710
Heather, Ricard, Danny,

309
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,178
got nothing for you.
Everybody, grab your stuff,

310
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,114
-swim out, enjoy your afternoon.
-Thanks, Jeff.

311
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,918
<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>This is the first moment</i>

312
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,355
after my little Do or Die win
that I can prove

313
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,923
<i>that, like,</i>
<i>now I'm about to start winnin.</i>

314

<i>a whole new version of me.</i>

315
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,294
<i>And having Xander and Erika</i>
<i>offers me a chance to say,</i>

316
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,962
<i>"Let's talk about</i>
<i>if you guys have your head</i>

317
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,998
on your shoulders again, and if
you're ready to get Ricard out."

318
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,007
XANDER:
That was sick.

319
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,441
-DESHAWN: Time to eat, y'all.
-ERIKA: Wow.

320
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,844
-Let's do it.
-Sustenance. Let's do it, man.

321
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:32,945
-Let's dig in.
-Wow.

322
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,413
The reward--
chicken and vegetables--

323
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,415
<i>this is Xander candy.</i>

324
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,050
This is, like, my kind of food.

325
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,019
Oh, gosh, Xander, this is, like,
perfect for your diet.

326
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,021
-Oh, my God, you guys.
-DESHAWN: Oh, my God.

327
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,289
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>So, this is</i>

328
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,857
like a little taste of home.

329
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,893
Thank you, rocks, for putting
me on the winning team.

330
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,030
<i>And the beauty of the reward is</i>
<i>food is put on the table,</i>

331
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,098
but also new potential allies

332
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,100
and new plans are put
on the table.

333
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,538
I see you guys
are strong in your voting,

334
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,906

-Yeah.

407

Like, you and I were

the game the same way.

if you bring Heather, you guys
kind of have a similar story.

00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,351
The consequence for moving so
quickly is, now you are dizzy.

501
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,220
Very, very tricky.

502
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,522
You can shinny across
if you want.

503
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,391
There goes Ricard.

504
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,427
He has won
two individual immunities.

505
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,563
Ricard starts
to untie his puzzle piece.

506
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,400
Xander's working on his.
Danny's working on his.

507
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,803
Erika getting there.
Deshawn inching slowly.

508
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,938
You are all dizzy from the game,

509
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,907
and you're dizzy
from this challenge.

510
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,343
-Oh, my God.
-Heather drops.
She's got to go back.

511
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,551
Ricard is the first out.

512
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,020
He can start
working that puzzle.

513
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,388
You're working from the bottom

514
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,191
to the top, but it reads
from the top to the bottom.

515
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,759
Here goes Heather.
Now she's got it.

516
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,028
Danny's got his... Ooh!

517
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,364
No, you got to come back.
Big fall by Danny,

518
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,132
but he's got the puzzle piece.

519
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,803
Xander's good.
Danny drops again.

520
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,239
<i>Survivor</i> can get anybody
on any given day.

521
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:25,844
Erika's good. Deshawn is good.
Danny's good.

522
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,913
Keep working, Heather.
You're in this.

523
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,482
This puzzle is difficult.
It's going to take a minute.

524
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,517
You got a shot.

525
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,221
That is how you do it, Heather.

526
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,490
Everybody is in this.

527
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,294
Now you're solving
a seven-word phrase.

528
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:47,165
23 days out here.
This gets you to final five.

529
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,067
Only two people in the game that

530
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,269
have not won individual immunity

531
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,405
are Heather and Deshawn,
side-by-side.

532
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,808
Erika has won it,
Xander's won it, Danny's won it.

533
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,376
Ricard has won it twice.

534
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,747
Ricard is working quickly,
checking

535
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,583
to make sure it's the same on
the front as it is on the back,

536
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,684
because it must be.

537
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,420
Deshawn trying to look down.

538
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,791
You better hope you're stealing
from somebody who is right.

539
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:18,930
Ricard takes his apart now
and starting over.

540
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,399
Deshawn making a little
progress.

541
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,102
If he's right, it would be
a big win, his first.

542
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,205
Xander trying to get into it.

543
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,741
Erika trying to get into it.

544
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,345
Ricard is back on the move.
So is Deshawn.

545
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,448
Right now, it is Deshawn
and Ricard.

546
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:40,585
Ricard checking again.
We are neck and neck right now!

547
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,154
Who's going to get there first?

548
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,989
When you think you have it,
step back and call it.

549
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:54,566
-Got it.
-Ricard thinks he has it.
Call it!

550
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,768
"Don't make this next vote
your last."

551
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:01,406
That's it! Ricard wins
his third individual immunity.

552
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,175
What a performance.
Cannot be voted out,

553
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,777
guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

554
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,446
Wow. That was fast.

555
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,116
-♪ ♪
-What clued you in on that?

556
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,751
Because you got it very quickly.

557
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,587
Um, the entire time
I was unspooling,

558
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,088
I was thinking
of every four-letter word

559
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,591
I can in this game,
until I had them all,

560
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,326
and I just needed to rearrange
them when I got here.

561
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,627
That's impressive.

562
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,497
-(laughs)
-Let me get your necklace.

563
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,065
Ricard, come on over.

564
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,834
-Good job.
-Good job, bro.

565
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,506
For the third time this season,
you've won individual immunity.

566
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,175
That's already a small club.
Most importantly,

567
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,910
you cannot be voted out
of this game.

568
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,079
You are guaranteed a spot
in the final five,

569
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,148
that much closer to the end.

570
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,284
As for the rest of you,
after 23 days,

571
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,220
Tribal Council tonight,

572
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,322
somebody will be
the 13th person

573
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,123
voted out and the sixth member

574
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,959
of our jury.
Grab your stuff, head back.

575
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,628
See you tonight at Tribal.
Congrats.

576
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,830
-Good job.
-Good job, bro.

577
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:02,167
<i>ERIKA: Before the challenge,</i>
<i>everybody was just thinking,</i>

578
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,936
"We just have to beat Ricard,
we have to beat Ricard."

579
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,173
<i>But we were so focused</i>
<i>on plan A</i>

580
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,141
<i>that when Ricard actually</i>
<i>pulls out the win,</i>

581
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,543
we're like, "Oh, crap.

582
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,012
<i>Time to put together a Plan B."</i>

583
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,655
<i>-ERIKA: Congrats, Ricard.</i>
<i>-DESHAWN: Congrats, Ricard.</i>

584
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,724
-Congratulations, Ricard.
-Congrats, man.

585
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,570
Liana.

586
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,742
Hmm.

587
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,543
<i>DANNY:</i>
<i>Ricard wins the challenge,</i>

588
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,847
<i>and I kind of go back</i>
<i>into my "I told you so."</i>

589
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,317
<i>We had the perfect opportunity</i>
<i>to do this at the last Tribal.</i>

590
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,653
And now we sit here
with Ricard immune

591
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,822
and possibly
me or Deshawn going home.

592
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,624
<i>At the end of the day, I'm still</i>
<i>a competitor, and I still</i>

593
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,092
<i>want to be in the game,</i>
<i>and I'll still</i>

594
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,794
<i>do everything that I need to do</i>

595
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:03,929
to keep myself in this game.

596
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,730
To come clean.

597
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,935
When you came back humming
and skipping along yesterday

598
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,137
after we got back,
and I was trying

599
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,471
-to make that fire...
-When did...?

600
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,441
-I was like, "Hmm. Interesting."
-Oh, no.

601
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,946
-(laughs)
-All right.

602
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,948
<i>DANNY:</i>
<i>Yesterday, after leaving</i>
<i>the reward challenge,</i>

603
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,283
<i>I decide to go search</i>
<i>for an idol,</i>

604
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,818
<i>and I find absolutely nothing.</i>

605
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,754
<i>Uh, some spiderwebs,</i>
<i>some burlap and some wood.</i>

606
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,890
<i>But I don't find the idol, but</i>

607
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,792
my search, uh, actually paid off

608
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,927
because people assumed
that I have found something.

609
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:43,168
Should I? I know
it wouldn't be there, but...

610
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,170
<i>DANNY:</i>
<i>I think them assuming</i>

611
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,272
<i>that I have an idol</i>
<i>is a pretty strong weapon,</i>

612
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,407
<i>and I think I can use it</i>
<i>to my advantage.</i>

613
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,977
<i>It's just trying to figure ot</i>
<i>how far to push it</i>

614
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,345
and not get myself eliminated.

615
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,413
Okay.

616
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,518
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>If we keep Danny,</i>

617
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,255
he's another person that could
beat Ricard in a challenge.

618
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,192
Like, it would be great
if Danny beat Ricard.

619
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,597
But we really don't want
Ricard winning another immunity.

620
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,399
Deshawn is the one that was
closer to the puzzle today.

621
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,201
-He was two letters away.
-Really?

622
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,603
He was the one that played
basketball the other day

623
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,705
-and beat Ricard.
-That's true.

624
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,140
-Like...
-But Danny's the only one

625
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,875
who's won another
immunity challenge.

626
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,243
And it was balance.

627
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,278
<i>Everybody was obviously upset</i>

628
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,280
<i>that Ricard won.</i>

629
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:33,284
<i>I think we might have made a</i>
<i>mistake when we kept him around.</i>

630
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,853
So, this is a huge decision
to make,

631
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,289
because if Ricard's able to win
all the immunity challenges

632
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,158
from here on out, then

633
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,861
<i>he's got by far the best résumé</i>
<i>in the game.</i>

634
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,096
<i>So it's important</i>
<i>that we make sure</i>

635
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,998
<i>that the people</i>
<i>we keep around are</i>

636
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,733
ones that could
potentially beat him.

637
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,936
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>I think that we can</i>

638
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,740
tell Ricard, let's split
between Danny and Deshawn

639
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,208
and vote out Danny.

640
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,376
If we keep Deshawn, we'd have...

641
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,677
We'll have a better chance.

642
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,579
-We have options.
-Yes.

643
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,716
<i>ERIKA: I want to keep Deshawn</i>
<i>in the game because I know tht</i>

644
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,619
Deshawn wants to go
to the endgame with me.

645
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,855
<i>But honestly Deshawn is</i>
<i>a bigger threat than Danny.</i>

646
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,824
<i>No one really knows</i>
<i>Danny's game.</i>

647
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,826
<i>Whereas Deshawn is someone</i>
<i>who's likable,</i>

648
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,530
<i>who has tried to make moves</i>
<i>and has overcome things.</i>

649
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:22,033
So there is a bit of work there
to figure out

650
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,569
<i>how to convince my alliance</i>
<i>that it's actually</i>

651
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,938
<i>in our best interest</i>
<i>to get rid of Danny,</i>

652
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,941
<i>when really it's everybody's</i>
<i>best interest</i>

653
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,609
<i>to get rid of Deshawn,</i>

654
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,977
except for mine.

655
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,983
I don't think so
'cause I feel like the things

656
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,820
that, like, Deshawn can do,
you can do them.

657
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,354
And Deshawn hasn't won anything.

658
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,889
I feel like
we could beat Deshawn.

659
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,192
I think that, like, Danny could,
like, weirdly do something

660
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,260
that, like, one of us can't.

661
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,730
Hmm.

662
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,233
<i>The only thing I'm really</i>
<i>nervous about is,</i>

663
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,403
<i>you know, Erika and Heather.</i>
<i>I don't know them.</i>

664
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,872
We've only known each other,
like, ten days.

665
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,341
<i>But Deshawn has had</i>

666
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,211
<i>with Heather and Erika</i>
<i>throughout this,</i>

667
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,745
so I would prefer Deshawn go.

668
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,115
I just, like,
cannot have Danny idol himself

669
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,649
into the final four.

670
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,651
<i>RICARD:</i>
<i>If it was Danny, Heather, Erika,</i>

671
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,187
<i>I don't feel there's a threat</i>

672
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,990
<i>that the three of them</i>
<i>could get together.</i>

673
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,927
<i>But I feel the slightest threat</i>
<i>if Deshawn was here,</i>

674
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:23,995
that could happen.

675
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,900
DESHAWN:
So as it stands now,

676
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,135
we're just voting
for each other.

677
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,437
-Yeah...
-Honestly, bro, either way,

678
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,272
we played...
we played a good game.

679
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,573
-We played a good game.
-Yeah.

680
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,308
Okay. Well, I also
should just tell you this,

681
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,677
-since one of us
is gonna be going home.
-Mm-hmm.

682
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,981
That I used to play
for the Cowboys for five years.

683
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,415
(laughs):
What?

684
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,884
I think I did a good job
of hiding it, though.

685
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,452
-You did a great job.
-I did a good job of hiding it.

686
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,887
The walk-on stories, though.

687
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,321
-So which-which team
did you play for?
-I did...

688
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,423
I played five for the Cowboys
and one for the Bears.

689
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,459
That's dope, bro. (laughs)

690
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,528
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-You ... did ..., bro.

691
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,530
<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>Danny's kind of become</i>
<i>like an older brother to me,</i>

692
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:02,433
<i>so tonight it sucks that it has</i>
<i>to be either Danny or me,</i>

693
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,036
<i>but one of us has to go,</i>
<i>and I don't want it to be me.</i>

694
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,139
<i>Survivor</i> is always based on
the foundation of a social game,

695
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,375
a strong social bond
with the players in the game.

696
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,510
<i>When you create</i>
<i>that social capital</i>

697
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,212

698
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,447

<i>Danny didn't do that.</i>

699
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,016
So now I'm trying
to cash in on that capital.

700
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:21,152
I really did mean
what I said with you and Erika,

701
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,488
that I think that would be
a good final three.

702
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,324

-Oh, my God.
-You...

somebody's about

and you walk in
with a grin on your face.

728
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,779
First of all,
I'm just so grateful to be here.

729
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,648
I made it to final six,
but, like,

730
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,783
I'm a wise guy,
and I understand

731
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,618
that I'm heavy
on the chopping block tonight.

732
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,121
I don't know what exactly
is going to happen, but

733
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,656
the four of them
are voting together,

734
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,324
and they're going to split.
They want to see if Danny

735
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,959
has the idol or if he doesn't.
I guess

736
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,627
they'll have to wait and see.
And then they're probably

737
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:12,163
gonna put all the votes on me
or maybe Danny.

738
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,033
-Wow.
-I'm ready for it all.

739
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,535
I'm here to just take it all in,
Jeff. I'm excited for this one.

740
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,070
PROBST:
Ricard, what's fascinating is

741
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,140
that I'm watching everybody else
react to Deshawn's prediction

742
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,708
that he might be in trouble,

743
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,843
and you get
very different looks.

744
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,945
Yeah, I don't want
to give anything away

745
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,348
with answering
that question, um,

746
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,817
but he and I had
a great day together.

747
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,420
So could you have a great day
with Deshawn

748
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,689
and write his name down tonight?

749
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,825
Yes. They did it to me
two days ago.

750
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,495
Yeah, Jeff, so if I can just
back it on up to the last vote.

751
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,131
I thought it was
absolutely asinine

752
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,133
for a group of people
to have somebody

753
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,002
as big a threat as Ricard

754
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,637
on the chopping block
and let him run free.

755
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,639
And my logic behind that was,

756
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:55,973
he's beat you three times
in competitions,

757
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,275
and he'll do it again.

758
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,910
PROBST:
Danny, you were nodding.

759
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,244
DANNY:
Absolutely.

760
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,046
I won the challenge,
Deshawn did the Do or Die.

761
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,182
I feel like
everything worked perfectly

762
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,884
to get the best player out of
the game. And everybody said,

763
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,853
"Hey, what we're going to do is,
we're going to beat him today."

764
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,421
That's how they woke up
this morning.

765
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,924
And then we look this way, and
this man got this necklace on.

766
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,659
So he earned
everything that he had.

767
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,227
So I'm not mad at him.

768
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,963
I'm not mad. I'm not mad at them
for making the decision.

769
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,366
Jeff, I-I think that it's,
like, what's considered a threat

770
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,901
is pretty relative
to each person

771
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,403
and where they are
in the game, right?

772
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,171
Of course,
Ricard has played a great game.

773
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,841
There's no denying it.
At the same time,

774
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,576
like, Ricard and I have
built a trust.

775
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,312
I know at least up
until this point, like,

776
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,280
Ricard hasn't betrayed me,

777
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,682
and I have no reason to believe

778
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,150
that he's going to
moving forward.

779
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:42,220
Whereas with Liana,
Liana's voted for me before.

780
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,021
So I made the decision

781
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,391
that could get me
a few more steps in the game.

782
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,293
And, Heather,
where do you sit right now

783
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,529
with six people left
and clearly

784
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,131
some fractures
Within the group?

785
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,399
(sighs)
That's a good question.

786
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,402
Uh, being told
that we made the wrong move,

787
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:01,406
not voting out Ricard,
it's so subjective.

788
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,040
We all have a reason
for what we're doing,

789
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:06,144
if we are really playing
this like a chess game

790
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,813
of where you are, where you hope
to get to next, and how.

791
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,715
So that was the reason
why I did it.

792
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,050
-It was for my game.
-ERIKA: Jeff,

793
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,619
everything here is risk
and reward,

794
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,155
and we'll see if it pays off,
or we'll see if,

795
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,389
you know, if it's a mistake,

796
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,191
but there's still game
left to be played.

797
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,527
PROBST:
Xander, to Erika's point,

798
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,663
who you vote out is important
to you because

799
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,998
you're either getting rid
of somebody

800
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:28,399
that you think will beat you

801
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,067
and/or you're getting rid
of somebody

802
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,370
that you think and hope
will vote for you.

803
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,173
So how do you navigate that
when you've got four people

804
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,041
and you're walking around,
saying, "Well,

805
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,543
"it's one of the two of you.
Don't know which.

806
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,077
Let you know tonight"?

807
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,713
XANDER:
Yeah, if I knew the exact answer
to that question,

808
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,049
then I'd get a million dollars
in the end

809
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,884
because that is the true trick.

810
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,519
Trying to pitch to the jury

811
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,154
of peers that you voted out

812
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,490
that you deserve the money
in the end.

813
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,659
So that jury management phase
has started.

814
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,695
PROBST:
So, Danny,
if you guys are right,

815
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,831
and it's one of the two of you,
what is the end?

816
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,700
How does it go down?
What's the last sentence?

817
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,870
Huh. The last sentence
for me would be,

818
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,674
"I came out here, and I left
my soul out here with<i> Survivor."</i>

819
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,275
I competed the hardest
that I could.

820
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,111
I've left it all out there
on the sand and in the water,

821
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,080
and I'm proud of what I did,
and I had a chance

822
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,950
to win today and save myself,
and I can accept the fact

823
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,152
that I lost
if-if that's the end for me.

824
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,386
PROBST:
How about you, Deshawn?

825
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,622
How do you write
the last paragraph for you?

826
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,591
Of course, I came into this game
thinking that would be dope

827
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,493
if I made it to final Tribal
and if I won.

828
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,161
But I'm still so proud

829
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,996
of everything
that I've been able to do.

830
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,465
And if I do go tonight,
I would like to just

831
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,768
throw out some more information
just to spice up

832
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,470
the game a little bit.
No false information.

833
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,973
This is all very true.

834
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,008
-Before you throw it out,
can I just do a gut check?
-Okay.

835
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,078
-How nervous are you, Xander?
-I'm fine.

836
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:49,113
-How about you, Erika?
-I'll deal with
whatever he says.

837
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,550
PROBST:
How about you, Heather?

838
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,652
-(sighs)
-DESHAWN: Listen, like,
it's gonna be

839
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,420
a tough road for me to get
to the end regardless.

840
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,489
So I'm just gonna say this
right now.

841
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,191
Erika will not be taking you
to the end, Heather.

842
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:03,227
She told me
at the water well, like,

843
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,830
"I can't bring Heather
to the end of the game

844
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,065
"because if I do,
she might steal some of my votes

845
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,268
'cause we played
identical games."

846
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,203
So that's what was said,
and I'm saying it

847
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,105
in front of everybody,
so you know it's the truth.

848
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:16,007
Erika has played
a very smart game,

849
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,609
and I think this is the point
where the rubber meets the road.

850
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,879
Let's see what you do when all
of your coins are out there.

RICARD:
I just find
the gameplay interesting

855
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:34,292
to try and do this truth bomb
in the middle of Tribal Council

856
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,294
when you don't know if you
were the one going or staying,

you're saying is true.

to take her to the end,

what if you were the one
to be by her side,

860
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:43,935
and now you just ruined it?

861

game left to play.

And I mean, with Heather and I,

out of this world to think

869

PROBST:
You and Danny have declared
that you're the two.

882
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,050
Danny's approach tonight was,
"I'm still in it.

883

"I'm still fighting.
Don't take it personally,

886
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,424
"If it is me,
I want to be ahead of it,

887
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,026
"and say that I already knew
it was gonna be me,

888
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,594
so I'm gonna blow up
the truth bomb."

889
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,229

what Erika is saying is

890
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,198
that if it is you,
you may never know

891
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,266
if it was intended
to be you or not.

892
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,036
Listen, Jeff, I've learned
a lot about myself thus far,

893

and this is maybe
another lesson, right?

894

this game with my gut,
