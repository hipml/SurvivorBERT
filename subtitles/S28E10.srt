2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,010
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,780
All clashed 
around the idols,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,140
and it was Spencer 
who found one.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,980
He's a simple idol, but 
I potentially bought some time.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,960
But the idol 
with different powers

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,280
remained to be discovered.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,020
It's protection 
I would love to have.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,530
I have to find this idol.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,580
Moreover, 
two alliances clashed.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,000
We have a majority of six.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,280
Tasha, Spencer and Jeremiah 
are easy targets.

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,980
But at the last reward, 
Tony saw an opportunity

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,520
to use the minority alliance 
to their advantage.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,900
LJ is shady.

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,110
I'll just need them 
when it's time to eliminate LJ.

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,880
Then I will join my alliance.

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,920
- Let them kill each other. 
- Yeah.

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,010
And everything will go just fine.

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,770
And at the council, 
he got what he wanted.

21
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,500
Ninth Person Eliminated 
- LJ.

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,330
He took LJ and his alliance by surprise .

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,710
LJ, the tribe has spoken.

24
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,840
There are eight left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,120
- It was interesting. 
- I love this game.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,260
Who switched sides? 
Just Woo?

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,690
- Or Woo and Tony? 
- Woo and me.

28
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,970
- And Tony? 
- Yeah.

29
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,850
They offered us 
to be five against LJ.

30
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,140
Why?

31
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,450
- I have many. 
- Alright, let's talk about it.

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,140
I couldn't tell you, 
or Trish, or Kass,

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,870
because you like LJ, 
you wouldn't have understood my reasons.

34
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,770
Tony completely mystified LJ.

35
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,300
First, I said to myself: 
"I would have liked to know".

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,500
But I immediately understood 
why he hadn't told me anything.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,640
He feared 
the plan would fall through.

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,630
So I wasn't mad. 
I still trust Tony,

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,100
and Tony still trusts me.

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,050
Is it a one-time alliance?

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,860
So I'm not 
down the covenant?

42
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,340
It does not exist.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
Every time we promise 
a six-man final,

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,360
it does not work.

45
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,050
It's true.

46
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,720
I like to try to anticipate 
the actions of others.

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,910
Tony is not so predictable. 
He likes to do big hits,

48
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,770
and I'm not complaining about it, 
because it benefited me,

49
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,100
but he could 
start again later,

50
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,960
and I can't 
always count on him.

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,240
Could we tell Woo 
we were eliminating Cliff? Nope!

52
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
Sometimes you can't 
say everything to some,

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,260
because it creates chaos.

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,350
The sooner we can act against Tony, 
the better.

55
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,540
I'm very united 
with Jeremiah and Tasha.

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,300
Now it's a matter of knowing, 
among those who are lagging behind,

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,520
who we can board 
to make a hit.

58
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
My warning flag is up,

59
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,120
because I eliminated 
LJ by surprise.

60
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm in trouble

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,980
I have to 
do something to get out of it.

62
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,760
Most people, myself included, 
we go the water way,

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,000
because it's a bit far from the camp,

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,300
away from the ears,

65
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,140
and this is where we talk about strategy.

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,660
So I started to work

67
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,360
to a small cabin 
near the well.

68
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,730
The well is here. 
There is a tree there.

69
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,050
I put bushes, 
shrubs, branches,

70
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,920
so that I could hide there 
less than two meters away.

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,180
This is where I will wait,

72
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,680
sitting in my spy hut.

73
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,290
Sorry, but I don't want 
to be fooled by Tony,

74
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,730
because honestly, I think 
he's playing us, Trish.

75
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,510
I would like to know 
how you see our situation.

76
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,780
Is there only one covenant?

77
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,580
I believe him. It's us five...

78
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,520
I think the alliance 
remains strong without LJ.

79
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,310
OK.

80
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,570
Because then, we continue 
to eliminate the three, huh?

81
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,480
But Tony 
took the wrong career.

82
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,980
He deserves an Oscar.

83
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,200
I say. 
We have to be careful.

84
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,570
During my watch, 
I overheard Jefra and Trish talking.

85
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,740
Trish said Tony deserved 
an Oscar for his acting skills.

86
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,230
Eliminate LJ, okay,

87
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,140
but that's his way of doing it

88
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,140
Which means 
I don't trust Tony.

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,210
He lied to me, 
and he wants us to be allies?

90
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,960
At this point, 
I trust Trish.

91
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,660
I trust Woo. 
I trust Kass.

92
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,420
And that's all.

93
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,830
I no longer trust Jefra 
because she no longer trusts me,

94
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,040
and if she doesn't trust me, 
I won't trust her.

95
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,060
So for now, 
I'm in trouble.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,900
Survivor Season 28 Episode 10 
Sitting in My Spy Shack

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,700
Over here, everyone!

98
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,530
Ready for 
today's reward event?

99
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,610
- Yes. 
- We are.

100
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,180
Today you will be divided 
into two teams of four.

101
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,460
On my signal, you will race 
to collect oars.

102
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,200
When you have them all,

103
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,600
two team members will use it

104
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,380
to solve a word puzzle.

105
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,480
Want to know what's at stake?

106
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,830
The four winners will leave from here

107
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,660
for a place of the most 
- the Kalau caves,

108
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,970
where you will enjoy a barbecue.

109
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,520
Chicken.

110
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,640
- Sides. 
- Oh my God.

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,690
- Potato salad. 
- Oh my God.

112
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,030
Chocolate chip cookies.

113
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,280
Is it worth it?

114
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
Absolutely.

115
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,770
We will create the teams 
and we will start. Let's go!

116
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,760
We have our two teams.

117
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,370
Tasha, Jephra, Spencer and Jeremiah.

118
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,750
Here we go, for the reward. 
Survivors, ready?

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,140
Mounted! Come on, Jeremiah!

120
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,820
Jefra struggles from the start,

121
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,000
she didn't board fast enough,

122
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,470
which slows down the purple quartet.

123
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,960
The Oranges go 
in all directions.

124
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,720
These large boats are not 
easy to maneuver.

125
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,840
Stay in the same place!

126
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,770
Go on! To the right!

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,630
It's teamwork. 
You have to go all the way

128
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,740
before they can come back 
and pick up the oars.

129
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,280
Let's not panic.

130
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,660
Tasha effectively leads her team.

131
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,150
Tasha, Jefra, Spencer 
and Jeremiah are in the lead,

132
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,020
they approach 
their first box of oars.

133
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,950
There are eight oars in all, 
four boxes.

134
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,860
You have it!

135
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,310
Tasha unties the oars 
for her team.

136
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,620
Woo will do it for his team.

137
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,130
There are two oars per box.

138
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,370
When you have them, 
move on to the next box.

139
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,330
- You got them? 
- Yes.

140
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,710
Tasha has the first oar.

141
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,720
I got it.

142
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,830
Woo has the first oar 
for his team.

143
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,450
Tony helps Woo now.

144
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,670
Tasha does this alone.

145
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,690
Tony and Woo take the lead.

146
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,130
Go on!

147
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,580
Tasha finally has her second oar.

148
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,430
The Oranges picked up the pace.

149
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,240
Woo attacks 
the second box of oars.

150
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,350
The Violets are on their way 
to their second box.

151
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,070
- Sorry, Jefra, how are you? 
- How are you.

152
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,690
No problem, keep going.

153
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,300
Woo and Tony have the second oars 
for the Oranges.

154
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,920
They stay ahead.

155
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,720
Jeremiah always unties those knots.

156
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,800
Tony has lost an oar, 
he has to go back!

157
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,260
It's going to cost 
his team a lot of time.

158
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,330
You need these oars 
to complete!

159
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,250
He must go up.

160
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,180
Carry on, carry on!

161
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,990
No, you have to get back on board!

162
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,510
Spencer and Jeremiah 
have the second oars.

163
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,790
Tony, back on board.

164
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,170
Equality again.

165
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,300
All the way to the right!

166
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,150
Tony has the second oar. 
The Oranges continue.

167
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,590
Let's go!

168
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,060
Tasha and Jefra have the second oar, 
they continue.

169
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,960
It's always neck and neck.

170
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,310
There is one box left. 
Two more oars.

171
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,490
To be!

172
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
You and is?

173
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,540
Tony and Woo are on the 
last two Oranges trains.

174
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,310
The Violets have passed the box.

175
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,250
U-turn, U-turn!

176
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,560
Huge waste of time. 
They must come back.

177
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,220
Tony is on the last 
orange team train,

178
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,580
and he has it. 
Come back, and attack the puzzle!

179
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,060
Spencer and Tasha 
need to straighten things out.

180
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,930
Full left!

181
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,220
Ready?

182
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,080
The Violets have the second oar, 
they are in on it again!

183
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,230
Start bringing the oars up.

184
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,060
Nice teamwork from the Oranges 
to bring all the oars quickly...

185
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,850
- Oars, oars! 
- ...on the platform.

186
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,370
Take the last one, Spencer.

187
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,470
Detach them all, 
then attack the puzzle.

188
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,610
OK, here we go.

189
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,370
The Oranges have all the oars. 
The Violets have all the oars.

190
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,060
Attack the puzzle!

191
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,670
Place them all and watch them!

192
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,250
Place them and watch them!

193
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,700
It's Woo and Kass for the Oranges.

194
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,800
Tasha and Spencer for the Violets.

195
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,880
Nothing. Put an N! NO, NO! 
There is a N?

196
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,850
It's a three-word sentence.

197
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,690
For the first, 
a barbecue afternoon.

198
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,310
The final. The final.

199
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,430
Yes go ahead!

200
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,860
The final. The final.

201
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,820
- Final? 
- They have "final".

202
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,880
- An idea? Give it a shot! 
- Like that.

203
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,620
Spencer and Tasha peep next door.

204
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,100
- Advice? 
- Wrestle. Wrestle.

205
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,300
They try to guess this sentence.

206
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,680
What is the link with the reward?

207
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,690
"It's worth fighting for."

208
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,060
Woo and Kass change their oars,

209
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,880
they have a completely different idea.

210
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,040
They change everything.

211
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,740
Put that at the end!

212
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,940
We have to think for ourselves.

213
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,990
"It's worth playing."

214
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,270
- Okay, okay, okay. 
- Spencer and Tasha are watching.

215
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,090
They think they have found it.

216
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,050
It could be 
a sprint to the finish.

217
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,220
Are you right?

218
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,600
Yes, that's it, that's it!

219
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,430
No that's not it.

220
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,120
But if.

221
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,390
A letter is missing!

222
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,100
It's worth playing!

223
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,700
And they mark, 
"it's worth playing"!

224
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,180
Tasha, Jefra, Jeremiah 
and Spencer win the reward!

225
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,310
Sorry to bump your head.

226
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,090
Shit.

227
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,900
That's what I was saying, 
a letter was missing.

228
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,190
huge win, great reward.

229
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,530
Grab your things, go ahead, 
and enjoy!

230
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,420
I have nothing for you. 
Take your things, return to camp.

231
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,880
We lost the race.

232
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,060
The first thing I say to myself,

233
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,340
we're in trouble.

234
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,660
Tony is in trouble too,

235
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,960
but here, we all have them.

236
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,480
Jefra, who no longer believes in me,

237
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
and no longer believes 
that she belongs to an alliance.

238
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,730
It is a problem. It's going to go wrong.

239
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,580
Home, sweet home.

240
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,860
A defeat has never 
made me so bitter,

241
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,620
but we must 
recognize their merit.

242
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,960
The worst is 
Tash, Jeremiah and Spencer.

243
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,280
Yes, they will absorb... attract... 
They will talk to Jefra.

244
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,570
I'm tired of losing.

245
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,620
But to make a million, 
I have to stick with these five:

246
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,860
- I'm going to get some water. 
- You need help?

247
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,580
No, I'm going alone.

248
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,040
From my point of view,

249
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,270
Tony felt threatened 
and got rid of LJ.

250
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,550
It doesn't hurt me 
that someone makes a move.

251
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,600
Tony is annoying, 
but my philosophy,

252
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,020
it is to keep the annoying ones 
and eliminate the dangerous ones.

253
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,920
If Spencer loses immunity, 
he has to leave.

254
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,590
Me, him, Jefra, Trish and you.

255
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,940
We didn't promise you anything, 
but we promised each other,

256
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,340
and we can include you 
in the promise,

257
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,140
because we didn't break any promises 
to LJ.

258
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,780
Lord, are we strategizing?

259
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,620
You have to, Trish.

260
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,300
Do you know how 
dangerous these rewards are?

261
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,130
Jefra is alone, what do you think?

262
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,700
I don't know, 
but I trust

263
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,200
in these lemons and these papayas 
that I have just found.

264
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,200
If anyone wants to 
come see it with me,

265
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
I'll be back to strategize 
all day.

266
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,100
I tell Trish I'm 
trying to talk strategy,

267
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,980
to act, to enlighten 
him on what is happening.

268
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,520
On the importance of this day.

269
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,740
This could be 
the beginning of our end.

270
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,500
And she asks where are 
the lemons and papayas!

271
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,520
Wanna help me, Woo? 
Because you know how to climb,

272
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,820
you may have to climb.

273
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,840
OK.

274
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,840
So Tony has to strategize alone, 
as usual.

275
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,840
I just need 
a few minutes alone.

276
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,330
I'll go get the idol.

277
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,880
Lemons and papayas!

278
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,990
It must be a joke.

279
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,520
Regarding the idol 
of the banks of the river,

280
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,290
it's very possible that 
Spencer, Tash or Jeremiah have it.

281
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,380
But at the merger, we were told:

282
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,180
"near your camp is hidden 
an idol with special powers".

283
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,670
That's all I know.

284
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,610
Let me find this idol, 
and I'll be Super Tony.

285
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,110
Tony won't be in trouble anymore.

286
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,190
Where the hell is she?

287
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,130
You see that? 
Oh my God, look at them!

288
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,090
Looks like Morgan's breasts.

289
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,170
Don't go any further, just shake.

290
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,740
- It's coming. 
- Lemons and papayas!

291
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,980
I shake this papaya tree,

292
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,670
I shake, I shake, boom!

293
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,620
And I harvest at least 
seven huge papayas.

294
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,610
How are you?

295
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,400
The branch in my right hand

296
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
was dead, 
I didn't realize it.

297
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,410
I tried to play it like 
Sylvester Stallone in Cliffhanger.

298
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,900
I swing my left hand, 
but immediately, crack!, and...

299
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,390
- Ah, my ass! 
- Something broken?

300
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,020
- Whoa, how are you? 
- Yes, I am fine.

301
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,010
- Is it normal that...? 
- It's like a cramp.

302
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,090
Oh no, I hope 
you didn't break your tailbone.

303
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,160
Spencer, Jeremiah, 
Jefra and Tasha, wow!

304
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,720
They live 
an exceptional reward.

305
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,840
that's all 
I didn't want to happen."

306
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,230
No, don't get up!

307
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,120
My ass! Ouch, my ass!

308
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,020
But I was very lucky 
to get away with it.

309
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,640
We got fresh papayas 
and lemons,

310
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,050
so, you know... I'm thrilled.

311
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,080
I'm ready to bust my ass 
every day for papayas.

312
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,240
- It's splendid. 
- That's crazy.

313
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,700
We don't experience this every day.

314
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,920
I had never been 
in a cave.

315
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,810
Pay attention.

316
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,230
- It slips. 
- Everything is fine.

317
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,280
Wow, that's too good.

318
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,170
The reward was really, 
really nice.

319
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,640
The cave was huge, 
it was exceptional.

320
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,020
There is no other word.

321
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,580
It's awesome!

322
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,310
Here is your meal.

323
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,630
- Lord, look at this! 
- Thanks.

324
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,290
I'll leave you, I'll be back soon.

325
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,350
Thanks a lot.

326
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,060
Thanks for the visit.

327
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
Although the cave was beautiful,

328
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,590
the table full of food 
was even more so.

329
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,510
It was a barbecue 
like at home.

330
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,640
Tell me everything. 
How many ribs for you?

331
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,400
- Of them. 
- Do you want two?

332
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,390
- Okay, let's say three. 
- Yeah, that looks good.

333
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,200
- How's the tea? 
- It is good.

334
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,880
I was at the reward, 
with nothing to distract me.

335
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,790
With my main allies, 
Jeremiah and Tasha,

336
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,720
and Jefra, who we have to recruit.

337
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,060
It was perfect, because I need

338
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,840
that Jefra is comfortable with 
this group of four.

339
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,560
How are you feeling, Jefra?

340
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,240
I'm a bit lost at this point.

341
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,180
because there was a big blow,

342
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,280
and I didn't know, 
neither Trish nor Kass.

343
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,680
So good, whatever, 
but I wonder

344
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,020
about my place in the alliance.

345
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,150
I'm wondering.

346
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,290
- Or if you have a place. 
- Exactly.

347
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,500
No one has an interest in keeping Tony.

348
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,690
- We agree? 
- OK.

349
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,420
- Yes. 
- I agree.

350
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,150
Tony must be the first.

351
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,570
Tony first, clearly.

352
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,350
Jefra, how would you like 
to work with us?

353
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,110
I need another rib 
to think about it.

354
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,780
Eat as much as you want!

355
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,740
- Anyone want some? 
- Excuse me.

356
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,900
I have something else for you.

357
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,370
- Oh my God. 
- My God.

358
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,050
Oh my God.

359
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,500
That's what I think?

360
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
- I know what it is. 
- Oh, Lord.

361
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,310
Jefra knows what it is.

362
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,160
Even before having 
the letter of my loved ones in hand,

363
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,550
I was shaking and crying, 
that's exactly what I needed.

364
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:03,760
My mother's words 
touched me so deeply...

365
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,360
Even if we 
really don't want to crack,

366
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,800
even if we 
really don't want to cry,

367
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,080
sometimes we have no choice.

368
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,820
I can't even look 
at my mother's letter.

369
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,840
"Don't let 
your kind heart be your downfall,

370
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,360
don't be afraid to lie, 
even if you're not like that."

371
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,790
It's probably a sign for me.

372
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,060
I should probably 
switch sides at this point.

373
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,510
I firmly believe 
that there is a reason for everything.

374
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,140
I don't doubt it for a moment,

375
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,590
I won the award because

376
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,020
I needed to hear 
what my mother had to say to me.

377
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,780
- Final square? 
- Final square.

378
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,780
- Final square. 
- Let's all shake hands.

379
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,110
Final square, baby.

380
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,170
- You already shook my hand, buddy. 
- I say.

381
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,470
Everyone shakes hands.

382
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,540
You shook my hand before. 
I'll remind you this time.

383
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,020
Over here, everyone!

384
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,260
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

385
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,760
You know what that means, Tasha. 
First of all...

386
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,200
I recover it.

387
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,830
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

388
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,860
Today you will stand 
on a narrow rail,

389
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,200
while keeping a ball 
balanced on a platform.

390
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,140
At regular intervals,

391
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,090
you will descend 
to a narrower part.

392
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,730
Your hands will descend 
along the pole,

393
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,370
making it more difficult to balance.

394
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,060
If you fall off the rail 
or drop the ball,

395
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,720
you are eliminated from the test.

396
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,720
The last person standing 
wins immunity,

397
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,970
ensures a one in seven chance 
of winning this game.

398
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,900
The losers, tribal council, 
where someone will be eliminated.

399
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,030
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

400
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,310
Alright, everybody 
in starting position.

401
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,630
Place your balls 
on your platforms.

402
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,390
Balance them and hold them

403
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,920
waiting for my signal. 
Let's go.

404
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,240
Three, two, one. 
Let go.

405
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,360
This test is launched, 
and from the first second,

406
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,730
the wind picks up, right at the right time.

407
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,750
It stirs many balls.

408
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,660
Kass struggles to keep 
his ball on his platform.

409
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,920
And suddenly, 
Jefra is eliminated from the event.

410
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,430
His ball falls. 
Jefra is the first eliminated.

411
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,780
Tony struggles to hold on.

412
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,330
Trish drops her ball, 
she is eliminated.

413
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,460
Tony drops his ball, 
he is eliminated.

414
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,910
When it happens, it happens quickly.

415
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,930
Suddenly, Kass is eliminated.

416
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,190
There are 
only four people left.

417
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,810
Three minutes elapsed 
in this first round.

418
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,290
This first round 
will last ten minutes.

419
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,650
Then we will increase the difficulty.

420
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,430
Only ten seconds left 
in this round.

421
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,190
I will count. 
Stay focused, it's not over.

422
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,430
Five, four, three, two, one.

423
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,490
You are safe.

424
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,880
Go to the next level.

425
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,390
Lower your hands down 
a notch on the pole.

426
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,800
And replace your balls.

427
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,590
Alright, here we go. I will count.

428
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:25,420
Five, four, three, two, one. 
Let go.

429
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,830
Everyone is now 
in round two.

430
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,150
It will last ten minutes.

431
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,400
Tash has some problems, right off the bat.

432
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,360
But it stabilizes quickly.

433
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,100
Jeremiah fails 
to recover his ball, he is eliminated.

434
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
He won't know 
what it's like to be immune.

435
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,520
All three 
have already won immunity.

436
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,950
All three know 
this feeling of protection.

437
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,740
All three would like 
to know him again.

438
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,670
Only ten seconds left 
in this round.

439
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,190
Here comes another gust of wind.

440
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,230
Hold on, 
don't let go now.

441
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,150
Five, four, three, two, one.

442
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,760
You are safe.

443
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,050
Good work.

444
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,010
Now go to the 
narrowest part of the rail.

445
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,460
This is the 
most difficult part of the test.

446
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,340
Now get your hands down

447
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,740
at the bottom of the pole. 
Everyone looks good.

448
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,640
Put your balls back 
on the platform, I'll count down.

449
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,700
Five, four, three, two, one.

450
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,850
This test resumes.

451
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,510
The rail is narrower.

452
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,340
And you have 
a longer pole to maintain.

453
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,530
This makes balancing 
more difficult.

454
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,050
It will take more control 
to perform a recovery.

455
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,970
Woo is in control, 
but he can't hold on.

456
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,670
Woo falls, 
and there are only two left.

457
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,200
Once again, Tasha and Spencer.

458
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,970
We have seen this clash before.

459
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,100
Spencer had won.

460
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,100
There is no longer a time limit.

461
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,990
We will continue until 
one of you falls.

462
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,830
Nice recovery from Tasha.

463
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,670
There you go, pick yourself up and you'll be fine.

464
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,240
There's a little wind again.

465
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,840
Nice recovery from Spencer,

466
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,520
but he does not succeed, 
Spencer is eliminated.

467
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,450
Tasha wins individual immunity!

468
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,790
She secures a place 
in the last seven!

469
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,240
Tasha, come here.

470
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,600
Tasha, once again, 
safe at tonight's council.

471
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,830
As for you, 
after 28 very difficult days,

472
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,000
someone's dream 
to finish this game

473
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,080
and earning a million, 
will end.

474
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,520
Pack your things, 
head back to camp,

475
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,520
See you tonight at council. 
Congratulation.

476
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,450
Thanks, Jeff.

477
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,920
I don't feel 
safe with Tony.

478
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,780
The rest of the alliance 
believes everything he says.

479
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,580
Like he was Jesus 
or something.

480
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,920
At the moment, I have more confidence 
in Tasha, Jeremiah and Spencer.

481
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,660
And this could be my chance 
to knock Tony out now,

482
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,840
rather than having 
to do it later.

483
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,030
- Well done, Tash. 
- Tash, one more time.

484
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,950
- You did it! 
- Nice job, Tasha.

485
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,810
Yeah, no, no.

486
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,910
- It was good. 
- This third level...

487
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,900
- I wasn't going to last long. 
- Neither do I.

488
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,700
- It wasn't for me. 
- Nope.

489
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,340
For now the plan is that 
Spencer, Jeremiah, me and Jefra

490
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,440
eliminate Tony by surprise. 
But the problem,

491
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,530
is that it could 
be 4 against 4.

492
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,000
We might have to vote again, 
then pull the rocks.

493
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But we think 
the person

494
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,660
the most important one to eliminate 
at this point is Tony.

495
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,420
Once again, 
no collar for Tony.

496
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,580
So today, 
I'm not chopping wood,

497
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,020
I don't make a fire, 
I don't boil water.

498
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,910
I have a mission. 
I need an idol.

499
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,290
In other Survivor seasons, 
it's still an iconic location.

500
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,020
There is a well-worn tree

501
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,440
behind our mailbox.

502
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,550
I had looked there the first time, 
I will look again.

503
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,280
I'm looking for the special idol, 
and you know what?

504
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,290
I will find her.

505
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,460
Please.

506
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,480
Let her be there.

507
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,980
You are really upset.

508
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,540
I see it on your face.

509
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,110
I know you and Tony 
are very close, but...

510
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,570
I don't feel safe 
in our alliance.

511
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,380
Back at camp, I notice

512
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,800
that there is a problem with Jefra.

513
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,580
She does not hide her feelings,

514
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,960
and she was almost 
on the verge of tears.

515
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,320
She thinks she's at the bottom of the wedding ring.

516
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,430
She no longer trusts Tony.

517
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,970
He acts like he's got it 
both ways.

518
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,340
but I'm sick 
of his falsity.

519
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,460
I'm sick 
of his lies about LJ.

520
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,780
It's like... 
He gets on my nerves.

521
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,270
So I'm going to the freak tree. 
There is nothing.

522
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,860
"Let's follow the path,

523
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,460
in case something goes out 
of the lot".

524
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,980
Looks like a rocket.

525
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,700
I come to a tree, 
it looks like a rocket.

526
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,310
It had huge roots, 
I had never seen anything like it.

527
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,470
"I have to search here".

528
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,940
Please.

529
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,330
I start digging, scratching.

530
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,220
Oh, damn it.

531
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,760
And I feel something.

532
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,900
So I grab a stick, 
and I dig, I dig, I dig.

533
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,000
Go on.

534
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,190
There is something.

535
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,880
"Please 
let it be that"!

536
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,100
Oh my God!

537
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,370
I almost fainted, 
I was so happy.

538
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,780
Then I opened it, 
and it's the special idol.

539
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,440
My God!

540
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,180
I love you so much.

541
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,540
This special idol 
is priceless.

542
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,320
"This immunity idol 
will protect you

543
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,900
from elimination to tribal council.

544
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,180
Unlike 
other immunity idols,

545
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,750
it can be played 
after the votes have been read."

546
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,710
Can we use 
it after seeing the votes?

547
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,530
Everyone will do...

548
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
"This idol only protects 
the person who finds it,

549
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,520
you can't give it 
to someone else."

550
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,060
I'll hide it now, 
then I'll go wash up.

551
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,070
I have to go.

552
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,240
I have to go wash up. 
I have to go wash up.

553
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,900
Do you realize 
its power?

554
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,210
I will show you its power!

555
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,780
In this game, every time 
you eliminate

556
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,500
someone who annoys you, 
it plays against you.

557
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,520
But I can't take it anymore.

558
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,340
Like everyone. 
That's why you have to keep it.

559
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,200
So, here's the thing. 
We can't eliminate him tonight.

560
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,700
If we eliminate him tonight, 
we empower all three.

561
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,050
We can't do that, 
because we won't beat them in the end.

562
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,490
We have a much better chance 
of beating Tony and Woo in the final.

563
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,340
Tony, we need to be able 
to trust you.

564
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,050
We need to be able 
to trust you.

565
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,650
- Because otherwise... 
- Don't insult me, Trish.

566
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,950
- I know, I'm just saying... 
- Don't insult me.

567
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,460
Everyone is freaking out 
that you're playing double agent.

568
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,740
Who is that?

569
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,990
Everybody.

570
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,700
- The double agent stunt. 
- It's... It's...

571
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,460
- I'm wondering. 
- It makes people paranoid.

572
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,460
I understand, Trish. 
But if you know who I am,

573
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,530
what kind of man I am, 
and that I gave you my word...

574
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,350
One two three four five. 
All three will leave.

575
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,270
I guarantee it.

576
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,770
I swear on my baby, 
I swear on my father,

577
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,660
I swear it on my mother, 
I swear it on everyone.

578
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,000
I cast doubts 
on Tony's integrity,

579
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,220
and he admitted that playing 
the double agent wouldn't work.

580
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,250
And Jefra needed to see me 
ask her for an explanation.

581
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,990
That's why I did this.

582
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,600
But I believe her to be loyal, 
she will not change sides.

583
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,270
I think Spencer has the idol.

584
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,190
- Yeah. 
- I can read people.

585
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,440
Wow, what do you think?

586
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,670
If Spencer has an idol...

587
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,340
So we have it in the bone.

588
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,140
Tasha is safe tonight,

589
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,700
so eliminating Spencer 
seems obvious.

590
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,860
Considering 
he's good with the jury,

591
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,630
and that he is very capable 
of winning immunity trials.

592
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,400
Jeremiah, on the other hand, 
is an athlete,

593
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,620
which also jeopardizes our chances.

594
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:28,270
But there is one thing 
we are not sure about.

595
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,640
And that's who has an idol.

596
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,070
Jeremiah, can 
I talk to you for a second?

597
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,150
I know I made a commitment 
to you the other day,

598
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,930
- but I will not vote with you. 
- OK.

599
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,300
I hope you understand, 
it's in my interest.

600
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,780
- Nothing personal. 
- Very well.

601
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,160
I saw Jefra in the water 
with all his wedding ring,

602
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,890
so everyone except me, 
spencer and tasha,

603
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,420
and I knew 
something was up.

604
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,370
- OK. 
- Yeah.

605
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,580
- Its good. 
- Sorry.

606
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,040
I had put a little trust 
in her, she shook my hand,

607
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,660
she promised and everything,

608
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,910
but I guess 
the pressure took over.

609
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,110
Everyone knows 
what to expect now.

610
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,410
Can I tell you something 
that I haven't told anyone?

611
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,010
- Are we okay? 
- Yeah.

612
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,890
I am a model.

613
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,560
No wonder you're so hot!

614
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,680
Jeremiah realized 
there was a real chance

615
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,580
let one of us 
go tonight.

616
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,740
He therefore decided to spill the beans 
and reveal that he is a model.

617
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,220
If you google my name, 
Jeremiah Wood,

618
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,040
add "mannequin" at the end, 
and you'll see!

619
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,070
- Jeremiah is a supermodel! 
- You wouldn't have guessed.

620
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,740
I'm not surprised that Jeremiah 
thinks being a model

621
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,060
be very important, a big secret

622
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,910
which he cannot reveal.

623
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,540
This is what is expected 
of the Beauty tribe.

624
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,750
So I decided 
to return the favor.

625
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,600
I also have something to say.

626
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,530
Good...

627
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,870
- So... 
- You have the idol.

628
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,630
- Yeah. 
- Really?

629
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,570
- For a week. 
- It's not true!

630
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,230
I told Tasha and Jeremiah 
about my idol,

631
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,560
because it's time to go for it,

632
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,160
roll the dice, take a risk.

633
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,540
If it works, 
it's a new chance.

634
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,250
The game is not over.

635
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,030
So who are we voting for tonight?

636
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,740
- Wow. 
- Why Woo and not Tony?

637
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,200
It is the most dangerous 
in the tests.

638
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,060
OK.

639
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,120
I can play it for me, 
I can play it for Jeremiah,

640
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,510
I can keep it. 
But if I use it wrong,

641
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,120
I could bite 
my fingers all my life.

642
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,460
Now here are 
the members of the jury.

643
00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:01,030
Sarah, Morgan, and LJ, 
eliminated at the last board.

644
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,680
Spencer, at the last tip, 
it seemed

645
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
that Tasha, Jeremiah and you 
were in trouble,

646
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,680
and then LJ was eliminated 
by surprise.

647
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,010
Is the game open?

648
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,000
It was for a while,

649
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,180
but we three know 
what to expect.

650
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,420
We are the minority.

651
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,410
Jeremiah, are you 
okay with that?

652
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,740
Yes. We were in reward yesterday, 
we chatted a bit with Jefra,

653
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,150
trying to see if we could 
turn the game around.

654
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,110
But she decided 
to go back with them.

655
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,900
Jefra, you seem 
to be very impressionable.

656
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,240
I was still a little bitter 
about this story with LJ,

657
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,490
and wondered 
about my place in my covenant.

658
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,100
And Jeff, the three of us, 
we didn't know.

659
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,900
- Trish, Kass and me. 
- It wasn't just her.

660
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,040
- All of them, we didn't know. 
- So to be honest, Jeff,

661
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,850
I started 
considering my options.

662
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,780
And I prefer

663
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,780
risk being eliminated 
by this alliance,

664
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,680
rather than going to the finals 
with Tasha or Spencer,

665
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,120
who would probably beat me.

666
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,710
Spencer, you're disgusted.

667
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,690
It's frustrating. 
If I was left out of the vote,

668
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,040
I wouldn't come back to the camp 
wondering about my place.

669
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,660
I'll come back to camp knowing

670
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,000
that I'm aloof, 
and down the covenant.

671
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,450
Tony swore on his wife 
and his kid, on everyone.

672
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,430
He broke many of those promises.

673
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,730
It will break others.

674
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,180
Jefra is right, now is the time

675
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,380
to step back 
and examine who you are playing with.

676
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,460
Can you specify 
which promise I broke?

677
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,830
- You broke a lot. Towards LJ... 
- Precise.

678
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,090
And I don't blame you for that.

679
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,040
- I know, but... 
- I did too, and I lied.

680
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,000
- I'm just saying that. 
- I didn't break a promise.

681
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,370
And there's a reason for that.

682
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,060
Let's put it another way.

683
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,590
If Tony and any 
of you go all the way,

684
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,330
- my vote will go to Tony. 
- Mine too.

685
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,880
Because Tony ran this game, 
and you didn't.

686
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,340
Woo, is that good 
news or bad news

687
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,970
what three potential jurors say

688
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,010
that if Tony goes to the final, 
he has three votes?

689
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,180
Yeah, those three are 
for Tony, and if he goes all the way,

690
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,750
they could vote for him.

691
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,770
But he will only succeed 
with our help.

692
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm not for Tony, 
I'm for me.

693
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,120
I'm just saying I think Tony

694
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,120
make sure 
you are in a position to win.

695
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,790
We had 
a discussion today that you know nothing about.

696
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,870
We criticized Tony 
for having it both ways.

697
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,070
We said 
it didn't suit us.

698
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,860
No one looks alarmed.

699
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,840
- It's the case. 
- That's why we talked to him.

700
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,400
He said he was gonna 
stop bullshitting

701
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,850
and I hope he heard us.

702
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,680
- Absolutely, absolutely. 
- High and loud.

703
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,300
Jeff, in this game, 
you have to make big moves.

704
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,310
But at the right time.

705
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,720
Timing is crucial.

706
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,780
Now, that would be inconsistent.

707
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,120
At this stage of the game,

708
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,060
we must stay united to move forward.

709
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,330
At this point, let them say, 
"Come back with us!",

710
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,030
it would be inconsistent.

711
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,590
So if it's five against three, 
and Tasha being immune,

712
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,750
Woo, how do you decide 
between Spencer and Jeremiah?

713
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,460
We examined the possibilities

714
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,020
whether one or the other has an idol.

715
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,840
This is the greatest danger 
at this stage.

716
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,210
So it's going to be tough.

717
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,980
' Cause we might 
vote for a guy

718
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,340
who is going to play an idol.

719
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,520
Jeremiah, the discussions 
are quite frank,

720
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,660
and you're pretty 
sure it's you or Spencer tonight.

721
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,240
What are you doing to divert 
the attention from you, to Spencer?

722
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,340
Spencer is very dangerous.

723
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
I would eliminate him, 
but he's my boyfriend.

724
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,250
He's probably 
more dangerous than me.

725
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
-Spencer. 
- Yeah.

726
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,580
How do you react?

727
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,120
He does what he has to do.

728
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,180
Yes, I don't blame him 
for giving these arguments.

729
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,490
I may be perceived 
as dangerous.

730
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,240
But you also have to 
consider social play.

731
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,720
He's one of the nicest guys

732
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,900
that I have ever met.

733
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,020
Tasha, how do you decide 
who to vote for?

734
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,400
Honestly, last time 
we voted for Tony,

735
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,500
knowing that we would not beat them.

736
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,700
And that pissed him off, so...

737
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,450
- I wasn't mad. 
- We're not voting Tony tonight.

738
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,780
- We'll pick someone and... 
- You can't vote Tony,

739
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,040
because I brought my bag of tricks, 
as usual.

740
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,820
- Yeah, so we'll pick someone. 
- Nope?

741
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
And we'll stick to it, Jeff.

742
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,640
I don't see you taking 
anything out of your bag.

743
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,510
Spencer, Tony is talking about 
his bag of tricks again, and you laugh.

744
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,200
I never leave 
camp without him, Jeff.

745
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,360
I do not know. 
I don't know what he has in his bag.

746
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,970
I would like to find out, 
but I haven't had the chance.

747
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,350
Well, it's time to vote.

748
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,760
Kass, it's up to you.

749
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,020
Bro, 
this vote sucks a lot, man!

750
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,690
You see!

751
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,160
I will count the votes.

752
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,790
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

753
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,720
now is the time to do it.

754
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,960
You can steal 
all the clues you want from me, Woo.

755
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,440
I have it for real.

756
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,060
It's not a real one.

757
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,250
He is indeed an immunity idol.

758
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,590
Votes against Spencer 
will not count.

759
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
You see the inexperience 
of this young boy?

760
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,820
He was going to give his idol to Jeremy.

761
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,470
He thought I was going 
to use mine.

762
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,710
Who is Jeremy?

763
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,530
By the way, it's a fake idol.

764
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,760
Good. I will read the votes.

765
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,930
First vote.

766
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,130
Woo.

767
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,980
Three votes Woo.

768
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,160
Jeremiah.

769
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,270
- Sorry, mate. 
- No problem.

770
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Jeremiah, equality.

771
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,180
Three votes Jeremiah, 
three votes Woo.

772
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,350
Four votes Jeremiah, 
three votes Woo.

773
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,730
Tenth person eliminated 
and fourth member of the jury:

774
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,740
Jeremiah. 
Bring me your torch.

775
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,380
- Jeremiah, the tribe has spoken. 
- Yup.

776
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,070
Goodbye everyone.

777
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,400
Another piece of advice with a big blow.

778
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,430
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

779
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,400
But if you want to win, 
you have to keep doing it.

780
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,830
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

781
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,120
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

782
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,160
In the next episode of Survivor...

783
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,260
To eat!

784
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,960
Welcome to Survivor Auctions.

785
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,350
While everyone 
is focused on auctions,

786
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,000
When she said she wanted to kill you,

787
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,800
she wasn't lying.

788
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,840
...to change the game.

789
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,620
If I can make Tony paranoid,

790
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,970
it's gold.

791
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,230
It will be chaos 
tonight, my friend.

792
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,750
For some reason, 
they targeted me.

793
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,810
Spencer did 
what he had to do, run away.

794
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,440
I thought I would make a million.

795
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,900
I think I played very well.

796
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,410
I think I could have 
gone all the way.

797
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,560
But what do you want...

798
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,460
At 34, I had never 
done anything like this.

799
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,880
I'm glad I 
had the opportunity

800
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,440
to come here and compete.

801
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,060
I did my best.
