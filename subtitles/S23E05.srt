1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:02,210
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,713
"SURVIVOR": WE ARE NECK AND NECK

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,923
IN OUR FIRST IMMUNITY CHALLENGE!

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,758
FOR THE PAST 17 DAYS, IT'S BEEN

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,428
A SEE SAW BATTLE BETWEEN TWO OF

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,054
SURVIVOR'S MOST EVENLY MATCHED

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:13,763
TRIBES.

8
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,848
THIS IS HOW CLOSE THIS CHALLENGE

9
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,432
WAS.

10
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,100
ONE COCONUT AWAY.

11
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:21,271
AT SAVAII, OZZY FOUND A HIDDEN

12
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:21,730
IMMUNITY IDOL.

13
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,064
SOMETHING GOOD!

14
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,066
Jeff: AND THOUGHT HE WAS IN

15
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,151
CONTROL OF THE DOMINANT

16
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:26,609
ALLIANCE.

17
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,277
I AM THE ANCHOR.

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,780
THEY WANT ME TO TELL THEM HOW TO

19
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,281
DO EVERYTHING.

20
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,575
Jeff: BUT ONE OF HIS

21
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,284
ALLIES, JIM, WAS PLOTTING

22
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:34,993
AGAINST HIM.

23
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:40,957
JIM TEAMED UP WITH COCHRAN AND

24
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,000
DAWN TO TARGET OZZY.

25
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,126
IF ELYSE GOES FIRST, THAT

26
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,628
BUYS ME ANOTHER THREE DAYS.

27
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,255
Jeff: AT UPOLU, COACH WAS

28
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,465
SAFE IN HIS ALLIANCE.

29
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,425
I THINK I'M SITTING PRETTY

30
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,050
RIGHT NOW.

31
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:51,468
Jeff: BUT NOT EVERYONE WAS

32
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,177
A COACH FAN.

33
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,639
I'M NOT BUYING COACH'S BS AT

34
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,223
ALL.

35
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,933
Jeff: STACEY WAS ON THE

36
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,310
CHOPPING BLOCK SO SHE LOOKED IN

37
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,521
VAIN FOR THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

38
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,648
TY IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, DAWN

39
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,484
PROVED SHE IS ONE OF THE

40
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,026
COMPETITORS.

41
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,319
DAWN WINS FOR SAVAII!

42
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,488
UPOLU WENT TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

43
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,198
WHERE BRANDON, THE NEPHEW OF THE

44
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,950
NOTORIOUS RUSSELL HANTZ, BROKE

45
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:16,618
DOWN.

46
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,786
YOU FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO

47
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,246
RECLAIM THE FAMILY NAME IN A

48
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,663
POSITIVE LIGHT?

49
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,166
I'M GONNA DO IT.

50
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,793
Jeff: FOURTH PERSON VOTED

51
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,295
OUT THE "SURVIVOR: SOUTH

52
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,004
PACIFIC."

53
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,964
IN THE END, STACEY WAS VOTED OUT

54
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,299
AND SHE PASSED ON A HUG FROM

55
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,219
COACH ON HER WAY TO REDEMPTION

56
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:34,886
ISLAND.

57
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:35,637
TRACY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

58
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,347
WHERE SHE WILL SOON BATTLE WITH

59
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,309
HER OLD FRIEND, CHRIS CHRISTINE.

60
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,894
14 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED

61
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:48,691

62
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,820
HELLO?

63
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,988
CHRISTINE, IT'S STACEY.

64
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,114
HEY!

65
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:55,406
OH, BE CAREFUL.

66
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,366
OKAY.

67
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,409
YOU GOT IT SO COMFY OVER HERE.

68
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,829
I WAS HOPING IT WOULDN'T BE

69
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,162
YOU.

70
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:01,579
I KNOW.

71
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,664
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

72
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,248
HOW ARE YOU?

73
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,917
I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,376
THEM SNAKES OVER THERE.

75
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,586
WHAT HAPPENED?

76
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,212
GIRL.

77
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:09,838
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

78
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,215
CHRISTINE, GUESS WHO IS

79
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,508
RUNNING THINGS?

80
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:13,925
COACH.

81
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,052
I-- I KNEW IT.

82
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,554
EVERYBODY-- THEY WERE AT

83
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,390
TRIBAL ACTING LIKE EVERYTHING IS

84
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:20,932
HUNKY-DORY.

85
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,433
IT AIN'T HUNKY-DORY.

86
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,101
YOU WHO TALK TO.

87
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,227
I TALK TO ALL THE GIRLS, I'M

88
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,895
DOING THIS.

89
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,437
YEAH--

90
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,438
LIES STRAIGHT FROM HELL.

91
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,901
ALL Y'ALL GONNA GO TO HELL WITH

92
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,360
GASOLINE DROPPED ON YOU.

93
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,862
JUST SURVIVE.

94
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,071
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

95
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,616
TRIBAL WAS SO FAKE,

96
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,325
SUFFICIENCY SO FAKE.

97
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,994
THAT IS NOT ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY

98
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,245
ON THE BLUE TRIBE.

99
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,955
COACH COMHERE, AND HE TRY TO ACT

100
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,915
LIKE HE'S JUST ALL HOLIER THAN

101
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,499
THOU.

102
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,584
HE IS NOTHING BUT A JOKE.

103
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,751
WHEN THEY FIND OUT THE REALLY

104
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,380
TRUTH ABOUT HIM... I'M GOING TO

105
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,634
START UP A BEE'S NEST AND LET

106
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,927
THE RED TRIBE KNOW COACH IS IN

107
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,720
CONTROL OVER THERE.

108
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,429
I'M ANYTHING TO SPILL EVERYTHING

109
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,015
I KNOW IS GOING ON OVER THERE.

110
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:05,768
Captioning brought to you by

111
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,437
Survivor Productions, CBS,

00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:30,627
HOW ARE YOU BRANDON?

113
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,421
I'M DOING GOOD.

114
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,130
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

115
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,131
I'M SORRY TO WAKE EVERYBODY BUT

116
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,132
WE HAVE TREE MAIL.

117
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:36,424
TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS EMOTIONAL,

118
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,133
MAN.

119
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,761
THE WAY THAT MIKAYLA ANSWERED

120
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,971
JEFF'S QUESTION WHEN HE ASKED

121
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,972
WHAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE ABOUT ME

122
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,183
THE MOST, SHE SAID, "I DON'T

123
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,435
LIKE HE'S A HANTZ" IT WAS PRETTY

124
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,144
PREJUDICED.

125
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,104
THE WAY SHE HANDLED THAT SHOWS

126
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,606
SHE HAD VERY LITTLE CLASS AT

127
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,315
THAT TIME.

128
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,650
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE

129
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,317
OUT HERE.

130
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,610
THEY HAVE REAL-- THEY HAVE

131
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,444
FEELINGS, YOU KNOW.

132
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,447
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE

133
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,491
THINK ABOUT ME.

134
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,993
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

135
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,535
I MEAN, I'M A GOOD PERSON.

136
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,456
I'M A GOOD GUY.

137
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,791
AND, YOU KNOW, IF I CAN'T WIN

138
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,751
THE GAME LIKE THAT, THEN I DON'T

139
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,545
NEED TO WIN IT.

140
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,674
OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.

141
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,593

00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,513
ATTENTION.

144
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,181
TODAY, CHRISTINE AND STACEY

145
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:25,723
ARE BATTLING IT OUT AND THE

146
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,184
OTHER TRIBE COULD GET

00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:31,479
INTELE FROM US AND AND I'M

148
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,564
HOPING WHEN ALBERT COMES BACK

149
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,191
THAT STACEY AND CHRISTINE KEPT

00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:43,574
THEIR MOUTH SHUT.

151
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,534
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

152
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,037
THE COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S

153
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,497
DUEL.

154
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,873
CHRISTINE WILL BATTLE AGAINST

155
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,752
STACEY VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

156
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,212
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

157
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,880
WELCOME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

158
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,548
ARENA.

159
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,257
STACEY, WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR YOU

160
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,217
TO SEE YOUR FORMER TRIBE MATES

161
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:01,884
WHO VOTED YOU OUT?

162
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,554
THOSE-- THOSE ARE LIARS, SO,

163
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,597
RED TEAM, LOOK OUT FOR THOSE

164
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,682
RIGHT THERE, OKAY?

165
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,017
IT WASN'T A TEAM.

166
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,186
IT IS BENJAMIN, ALBERT, AND

167
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,272
SOPHIE.

168
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,565
BUT WHO ARE THEY ANSWERING TO,

169
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,608
BENJAMIN AND ALBERT.

170
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,651
Jeff: BENJAMIN, COACH.

171
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,945
BENJAMIN IS RUNNING THE TEAM.

172
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,571
BENJAMIN MAKES THE DECISIONS.

173
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,740
MAKES ALL THE DECISIONS.

174
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,116
Jeff: WHEN I SAID COACH,

175
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,076
YOU SAID, NO, BENJAMIN.

176
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,702
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE?

177
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,871
ADULTS CALL HIM BENJAMIN.

178
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,539
WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT,

179
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,081
IT'S BENJAMIN.

180
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,041
Jeff: SO YOUR WAY OF

181
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,542
FIGHTING BACK IS TO SAY I WILL

182
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,960
NOT HONOR THE COACH NAME.

183
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,211
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

184
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,921
WHAT WAS HIS BIRTH NAME?

185
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,882
IT WASN'T COACH.

186
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,467
IT WAS BENJAMIN, WASN'T IT.

187
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,634
AND THE CHILDREN, 26, 22, THEY

188
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,721
LISTEN TO ALL THE BENJAMIN'S

189
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,266
HALLOWEEN JOKES, CHUCK E. CHEESE

190
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:50,725
JOKES.

191
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,603
THEY WANT IT.

192
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,939
COME ON, EVERY DAY HE GOT A

193
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,440
STORY.

194
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,401
I WASN'T BUYING IT.

195
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,819
NO.

196
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,613
SO, LIKE YESTERDAY, LIKE THE

197
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,572
TRIBAL WAS ALL CAHOOTS, LET'S

198
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,282
GIVE A HUG.

199
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,785
KEEP THAT HUG.

200
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,911
FOR ME.

201
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,621
BECAUSE IT WASN'T REAL.

202
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,288
SOUR GRAPES.

203
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,207
Jeff: YOU GUYS READY TO GET

204
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,166
TO TODAY'S DUEL.

205
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:15,792
YEAH.

206
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,376
Jeff: TODAY'S DUEL WILL

207
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,795
REQUIRE CONCENTRATION AND

208
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,504
COORDINATION.

209
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:19,796
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP A BALL DOWN

210
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,505
A CHUTE.

211
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,799
IT WILL SPIRAL DOWNWARD UNTIL IT

212
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,634
FALLS OUT THE BOTTOM WHERE YOU

213
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,302
MUST CATCH IT, PUT IT BACK IN

214
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,345
THE CHUTE.

215
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,679
EVERY FEW MINUTES WE'LL ADD

216
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,388
ANOTHER BALL.

217
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,349
THE BALLS WILL ALTERNATE LEFT

218
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,975
AND RIGHT, MAKING IT MORE

219
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,726
DIFFICULT TO TRACK THEM.

220
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,520
IF AT ANY POINT A BALL HITS THE

221
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,815
GROUND, YOU'RE OUT OF THE DUEL.

222
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,691
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING STAYS

223
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,567
ALIVE ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

224
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:46,447
THE LOSER IS OUT OF THIS GAME

225
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:46,989
FOR GOOD.

226
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,657
THIS IS IT, ONE SHOT.

227
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,998
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

228
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:56,541
YOU GO, GIRL.

229
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,209
YOU, TOO.

230
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:58,626
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE

231
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,168
GO.

232
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,130
TAKE YOUR FIRST BALL.

233
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,548
AND DROP IT IN THE CHUTE.

234
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,217
WE ARE ON.

235
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,717
YOU WANT TO LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER

236
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,845
DAY IN THIS GAME?

237
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,848
YOU MUST WIN.

238
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,473
CONCENTRATION.

239
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,892
THAT IS THE KEY TO THIS

240
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,560
CHALLENGE.

241
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,603
ONE BALL IS PRETTY EASY.

242
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,731
ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS

243
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,401
TO ADD ANOTHER BALL.

244
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,403
REMEMBER TO THINK ABOUT YOUR

245
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,112
SPACING.

246
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,699
IT'S CRITICAL IN THIS CHALLENGE.

247
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,411
TWO BALLS A LITTLE TRICKIER.

248
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,579
AND THEY'RE ALTERNATING LEFT AND

249
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,997
RIGHT.

250
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,916
HARD TO TRACK.

251
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,043
YOU GUYS ARE DOING GREAT.

252
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:48,176
KEEP CONCENTRATING.

253
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,054
ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS.

254
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
THINK ABOUT YOUR SPACING.

255
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,057
STACEY DROPS A BALL RIGHT OFF

256
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,559
THE BAT, NOT PAYING ANY

257
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,102
ATTENTION TO WHAT THE OTHER

258
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,437
BALLS ARE DOING.

259
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,897
YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS AND SHE

260
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,772
JUST THROWS IT IN.

261
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,398
SO STUPID.

262
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,026
Jeff: CHRISTINE TAKING HER

263
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,777
TIME, PLACING IT.

264
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,905
USING THE SPACING.

265
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,323
EVERYBODY'S GOOD.

266
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:10,781
THREE BALLS NOW.

267
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:21,584
VERY DIFFICULT.

268
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,544
ABSOLUTE CONCENTRATION IN THIS

269
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,212
CHALLENGE.

270
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,797
CHRISTINE WITH A NICE SAVE.

271
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,925
THERE ARE NO TOMORROWS FOR THE

272
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,592
LOSER.

273
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,635
YOU WILL BE OUT OF THIS GAME FOR

274
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,722
GOOD.

CHRISTINE WITH ANOTHER NICE

276
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:37,725
SAVE.

277
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,646
JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

278
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,273
Jeff: YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD

279
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:44,857
RHYTHM GOING.

280
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:54,242
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.

281
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,993
STACEY DROPS A BALL.

282
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:56,994
CHRISTINE STAYS ALIVE ON

283
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,081
REDEMPTION ISLAND!

284
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,916
( APPLAUSE )

285
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,125
GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

286
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,630

287
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,173
Jeff: STACEY.

288
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:09,715
YEAH.

289
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,342
Jeff: WHAT DID THIS

291
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,261
I CHALLENGED MYSELF.

292
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,136
THIS IS SOMETHING I NEVER WOULD

293
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,720
HAVE DONE.

294
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,764
YOU KNOW, I'M A FUNERAL

295
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,807

I MEAN, I'M A DIVA.

298
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,769
WHO LIVES LIKE THIS?

299
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,271

00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,022

YOUR TRIBE MATES, UP TO YOU.

EVERYTHING AND ALBERT IS HIS

331
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:16,907
RIGHT-HAND MAN.

332
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,700
THOSE WERE THINGS I THOUGHT WE

333
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,993
WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP UNDER THE

00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,202
RADAR PRETTY WELL.

335
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:20,870
IT JUST PISSES ME OFF BECAUSE IT

336
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,872
MAKES US LOOK BAD IN FRONT OF

337
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,082
THE OTHER TRIBE AND I KNOW COACH

00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,209

BAD?

345
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,440
IT WAS BAD, DUDE.

STACEY, SHE SAID WE'RE ALL

00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,026

SHE SAID THAT YOU, SOPHIE,

00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,241
MYSELF WERE CONTROLLING STUFF.

350
00:10:59,325 --> 00:10:59,909
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

351
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,078
STACEY JUST WENT ON A

352
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,411

353
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,037

00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,336

JEFF IS LIKE YOU REFUSE TO

00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,548
DIGNIFY HIM AS COACH.

362
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,549
HE'S BENJAMIN.

363
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,385
IF ANYBODY CALLS ME BENJAMIN

364
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,303
TO MY FACE I'LL GO NUTS.

365
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,347
MY PARENTS CALL ME COACH.

366
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,515
I'VE BEEN CALLED COACH SINCE I

367
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,352

368
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,270

00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,133
THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN ME,

382
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:57,800
OZZY, KEITH, JIM, AND WHITNEY IS

383
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,926
STILL PRETTY STRONG.

384
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,010
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD TO TALK

385
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,346
ABOUT THE VOTE AND WHAT IT WILL

386
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,432
COME DOWN TO AT THE NEXT TRIBAL

387
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,266
COUNCIL, WHICH IS GREAT IF

388
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,600
YOU'RE ONE OF US.

389
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,102
THEN THERE'S OZZY AND MYSELF,

390
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,687
AND I'M KIND OF JUST FOLLOWING

391
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,438
HIS LEAD.

392
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,647
I BELIEVE HE CAN TAKE ME FAR IN

393
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,148
THE GAME AND I THINK WE SEE THE

394
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,983
GAME THE SAME WAY.

395
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,317
WE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE

396
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,611
ALLIANCE, ABOUT THE MERGE, ABOUT

397
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,195
MAKING IT FAR.

398
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,285
WE'RE PALS.

399
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,997
TRIP, CHO-CHO MAN.

400
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,665
GOOD STUFF.

401
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,666
I'M THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT

402
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,375
COULD, MAN.

403
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,042
THE LITTLE COCHRAN THAT

404
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:32,751
COULD.

405
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,670
YEAH, THE LITTLE COCHRAN THAT

406
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,296
COULD.

407
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,839
THE LITTLE COCHRAN THAT

408
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,548
COULD.

409
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,966
HODO YOU SPELL THAT, C-O-C-H.

410
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,843
YOU WON'T HAVE TO SPELL THAT

411
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,927
ANY TIME SOON.

412
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,971
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SPELLING,

413
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:44,680
MAN.

414
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,807
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PHONETICS

415
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,516
OR ANYTHING.

416
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,351
KEEP MY NAME AS FAR OFF YOUR

417
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,019
FINGERS AND YOUR TONGUE AS

418
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:50,352
POSSIBLE.

419
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,690
THEY ARE.

420
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,941
I WORK MY ASS OFF AROUND

421
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,569
CAMP, EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT A BIG

422
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,862
PROVIDER LIKE OZZY OR ANYBODY.

423
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,071
I'M WORKING HARD, AND THEN TO

424
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,907
SEE AS YOUY AND ELYSE SLEEPING

425
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,494
IN EVERY SINGLE DAY, THEY'RE

426
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,370
WRAPPED UP IN THEIR LOVE BLANKET

427
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,079
WELL INTO THE EARLY-- OR LATE

428
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:09,830
MORNING.

429
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,208
I FIND EVERY LITTLE THING ABOUT

430
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,042
THEM IRRITATING NOW.

431
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,376
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

432
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,794
WE'RE BACK!

433
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,422
WE'RE HOME!

434
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,381
READY?

435
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,049
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

436
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,050
WHO WAS VOTED OUT?

437
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,676
MY GUESS, PUPPET DRESS.

438
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,221
THEY VOTED STATE STACY OUT

439
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:25,971
PURPLE DRESS!

440
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:26,639
YES.

441
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,224
I REALLY THOUGHT THEY WOULD

442
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,225
GO FOR WEAK BUT THEY'RE GOING

443
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,601
FOR TEAM COACH.

444
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:30,976
ANYBODY WHO WASN'T WITH COACH IS

445
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,644
GOING OUT.

446
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,437
COACH IS RUNNING THE SHOWY.

447
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,398
ACTUALLY, THEY CALLED HIM

448
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:36,982
BENJAMIN.

449
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,192
SHE'S LIKE, WATCH OUT.

450
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,277
BENJAMIN IS IN CHARGE, ALBERT,

451
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:40,736
SOPHIE.

452
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,403
IT'S NOT UNIFIED.

453
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,738
IT'S NOT--

454
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,198
YEAH.

455
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,408
BASICALLY THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIS

456
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:46,867
PUPPETS.

457
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,409
COACH, ALBERT.

458
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,203
IF COACH IS STOCK MARKET

459
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,871
HE'LL GET RID OF ALBERT SOON.

460
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,414
I THINK ALBERT AND HE ARE

461
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:52,998
ALIGNED.

462
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,750
WHY WOULD HE GET RIDE OF

463
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,417
ALBERT?

464
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,710
IF THEY GET RID OF ALBERT--

465
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,753
BEFORE THE HERM.

466
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,588
OZZY MADE ONE BIG MISTAKE.

467
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,258
HE REVEALED IF HE WERE COACH HE

468
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,050
WOULD GET RID OF ALBERT.

469
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,093
THAT'S HUGE INFORMATION BECAUSE

470
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,470
IF OZZY IS SAYING COACH SHOULD

471
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,013
GET ONE OF THE STRONGER PEOPLE

472
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,891
ON HIS TRIBE, THAT'S SAYING OZZY

473
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,934
SHOULD GET RID OF ONE OF THE

474
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,935
STRONGER PEOPLE ON HIS SIDE.

475
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,312
THE TWO STRONG PEOPLE ARE ME AND

476
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:15,896
KEITH.

477
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,273
STAY HUMBLE, POSITIVE,

478
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:17,898
UNIFIED.

479
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,816
ONCE I HEARD THAT, I KNEW

480
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,400
WHAT I HAD.

481
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,985
NOTHING SELLS LIKE FEAR.

482
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,112
I'M GOING TO PUT THAT FEAR IN

483
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,948
KEITH TELL HIM TO GET ELYSE GONE

484
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,075
NEXT.

485
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,794
THE DUEL WAS DEFINITELY

486
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,462
PAINFUL TO HEAR SOME OF THE

487
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,171
THINGS THAT WERE SAID-- NOT

488
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,173
PAINFUL PERSONALLY BUT PAINFUL

489
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,467
TOWARDS MY CAUSE.

490
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,760
DESPITE HOW STASE SENOT THE

491
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,262
SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED SHE

492
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,472
STILL SAID COACH AND ARE RUNNING

493
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,724
THINGS AND I'M GOING TO HAVE A

494
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,809
TARGET ON MY BACK ONCE WE GO TO

495
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,810
THE MERGE.

496
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:55,936
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY IT GET ME

497
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,979
OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SEE

498
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,814
ME AS A THREAT.

499
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,481
THAT CLUE IS STILL OUT THERE AND

500
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,984
THAT IDOL IS STILL OUT THERE.

501
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:09,033
I NEED TO FIND IT NOW.

502
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,160
THE CLUE!

503
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,169
GOOD STUFF RIGHT HERE.

504
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,004
"IT'S DEFINITELY NEAR THE

505
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,505
JUNGLE, SOMEWHERE BY THE BEACH.

506
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,214
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REALIZE

507
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,177
IS IT'S JUST BARELY OUT OF

508
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,844
REACH.

509
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:29,511
YOU COULD STAY DRY IF THE TIDE

510
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,180
IS RIGHT, BUT YOU'LL NEED TO

511
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,349
CLIMB TO HAVE IDOL IN SIGHT."

512
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:40,522
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

513
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,523
THE CLUE KIND OF TOLD ME THE

514
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,067
LOCATION OF THE IDOL IS

515
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,486
SOMEWHERE ON THE BEACH, WHERE

516
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,987
THE TIDE COMES IN KIND OF HIGH,

517
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,822
AND IT'S SOMEWHERE UP OUT OF

518
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,531
REACH IN THE TREE.

519
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,492
ONE BY ONE, I'M GOING TREE AFTER

520
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,159
TREE AFTER TREE.

521
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,327
THE MORE I'M LOOKING, I'M

522
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,078
STARTING TO GET A LITTLE

523
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:54,745
FLUSTERED.

524
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,205
SO I FIGURED I CAN KILL TWO

525
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,207
BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.

526
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,167
I CAN KIND OF FURNISH GARNER

527
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,252
COACH AND SOPHIE'S TRUST BY

528
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,380
LETEG THEM IN ON THIS IDOL AND I

529
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,382
CAN ALSO HAVE THEM BE HELPERS

530
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,132
FOR ME TO FIND THE IDOL BECAUSE

531
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,385
FRANKLY I THINK I CAN'T DO THIS

532
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,052
BY MYSELF.

533
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,681
I FOUND A CLUE TO THE SECOND

534
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,058
IDOL, AND I KNOW THAT IT'S IN A

535
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:16,433
TREE.

536
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,017
IT'S HIGH.

537
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,228
AND IT'S BY THE BEACH.

538
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,563
I'M ONLY GOING TO TELL YOU TWO

539
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,189
BECAUSE I TRUST YOU TWO THE

540
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:22,856
MOST.

541
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,400
THIS IS A HUGE GAME CHANGER.

542
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,276
YEAH, IT IS HUGE.

543
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,321
ALBERT COULDN'T FIND THE HIDDEN

544
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,114
IMMUNITY IDOL BUT HE'S FOUND A

545
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:30,823
CLUE.

546
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,199
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL THE WHOLE

547
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,410
ALLIANCE SO ONLY THE THREE OF US

548
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,245
KNOW ABOUT THE CLUE, ALBERT,

549
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,454
SOPHIE AND I.

550
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,414
IT WILL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

551
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,249
I CHECKED THIS TREE AND THIS

552
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:40,916
TREE.

553
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,127
I CHECKED TWO TREES OVER THERE

554
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,171
BUT I CAN'T FIND THE IDOL.

555
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,132
IT DEFINITELY SAID IN A TREE?

556
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,216
IT SAYS OUT OF REACH.

557
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,300
YOU WANT TO DO A JOB RIGHT,

558
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,177
YOU DO IT YOURSELF.

559
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,430
SO I JUST SAID TO MYSELF I'VE

560
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,224
GOT TO TAKE THIS INTO MY OWN

561
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:57,474
HANDS.

562
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:10,195
OW!

563
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,489
MAYBE I'M GOING ABOUT THIS THE

564
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,866
WRONG WAY.

565
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,616
I DON'T TROOPS IN IT'S YOUR WILL

566
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,077
THAT I FIND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

567
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,079

COME TO ME.

571
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,461
THIS HAS GOT TO BE IT.

572
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,757
ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE.

573
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,341
COACH WADE HAS FOUND THE HIDDEN

574
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:36,263
IMMUNITY IDOL, AND LO AND

A GOLDEN LITTLE GEM FOR COACH

577
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,270
WADE TO HOLD ON TO.

578
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:47,483
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, ARE THE STARS

579
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,984
ALINING FOR COACH OR WHAT?

580
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,527
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING MOMENT

581
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,904
IN 67 DAYS FOR COACH PLAYING

582
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,197
THIS GAME.

583
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,199
MOMENT OF TRUTH.

584
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,702
WE'VE GOT THIS GAME BY THE

585
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,328
BALLS, GUY.

586
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,204
THIS MORNING I THOUGHT TO

587
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,498
MYSELF, COULD THIS DAY GET ANY

588
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,165
WORSE?

589
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:03,874
BUT NOW COACH IS A HAPPY MAN.

590
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,583
THINGS COULDN'T BE GOING BETTER.

591
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,668
I HAVE TO GET AHOLD OF MYSELF

592
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,796
AND SAY DRAGON, JUST GET BACK IN

593
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,505
THERE.

594
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,214
I'M JUST SO HAPPY I'M PLAYING

595
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,508
THE GAME WITH YOU TWO.

596
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,550
CAN'T GO TOO CRAZY.

597
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,218
I'M NOT RUNNING THE SHOW, BUT AT

598
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,346
THE MOMENT, PRETTY CLOSE.

599
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:32,027
♪ ♪ ♪

600
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,528
ARE YOU READY TO DO THIS?

601
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,030
LET'S DO IT, MAN.

602
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,909
THE OCEAN IS MY CANVAS, AND THE

603
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,911
FISH ARE MY PALETTE.

604
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,539
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY

605
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,248
OUTDOORSY SKILLS, BUT I FIGURE,

606
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,793
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA STEP UP.

607
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,710
I'M SLIGHTLY NERVOUS GOING ON

608
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,419
THE BOAT FOR THE FIRST TIME

609
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,547
BECAUSE I BRING ZERO EXPERIENCE,

610
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,507
ZERO ABILITY, AND ZERO

611
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,049
CONFIDENCE.

612
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:54,508
SO WE SIT ON THE LEFT?

613
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,175
ON THE RIGHT.

614
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,052
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

615
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:57,553
PROVE ANYTHING TOWARDS BEING

616
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,095
ABLE TO CATCH FISH.

617
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,763
THAT'S LEFT TO OZZY.

618
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,472
BUT I HOPE THIS WILL BE A

619
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,390
BONDING EXPERIENCE SO THAT I'M

620
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,892
NOT VIEWED AS ONE OF THE GIRLS

621
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,476
WHO HANGS AROUND CAMP WHILE THE

622
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,729
TRUE MEN GO OUT FISHING.

623
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,416
I THINK MY REPUTATION IN

624
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,543
"SURVIVOR" IS I'VE BEEN THE GUY

625
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,212
THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT AND

626
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,047
HUNT FISH AND PROVIDE PEOPLE

627
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,257
WITH SUSTENANCE, BUT FISHING'S

628
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,925
NOT EASY.

629
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,634
IT MIGHT LOOK EASY TO SOMEBODY

630
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,053
WATCHING AT HOME, PUT IT REALLY

631
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,555
IS VERY DIFFICULT, AND IT TAKES

632
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,431
A LOT OUT OF ME.

633
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,390
I GET CUT UP ALL THE TIME.

634
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,477
JUST THE FACT THAT I'VE GOT TO

635
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,186
HOLD MY BREATH CONTINUOUSLY AND

636
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,272
SORT OF STAY IN ONE POSITION.

637
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,648
IT'S ALMOST LIKE UNDERWATER

638
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,190
YOGA.

639
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:57,112
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

640
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,280
NICE!

641
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:58,989
NICE!

642
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,949
I'M TOTALLY HAPPY TO PLAY THE

643
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,409
PROVIDER ROLE, AND I THINK IT'S

644
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,285
GOING TO PUT ME IN A STRONGER

645
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,329
POSITION THAN ANYONE ELSE.

646
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,914
IT'S LIKE I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

647
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,917
REALLY BECOMING MY TRIBE.

648
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,252
OH, YA!

649
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:17,591
HOLY CRAP!

650
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,008
AWESOME, WOW.

651
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,550
YEAH, WE GOT 11.

652
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,469
HOLY CRAP.

653
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,971
HAVING WATCHED "COOK ISLANDS"

654
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,432
AND "FANS VERSUS FAVORITES" YOU

655
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,477
SEE OZZY AS KIND OF SUPERHUMAN

656
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,941
GUY THAT CAN DO NO WRONG, BUT

657
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,317
OZZY, IT'S THIS MIDDLE AGED OZZY

658
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,152
WHO HAS A FEW MOMENTS OF GLORY

659
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,612
EACH DAY WHERE HE RUNS OUT AND

660
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,197
GETS US SOME FISH BUT OTHERWISE,

661
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,616
HE'S KIND OF A LAZY ASS.

662
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,117
HE'S PACKAGING THE ARROGANT

663
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,786
FISHER BOY, JUNGLE BOY, WHO

00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,537
FEELS LIKE HE CAN DO NO WRONG

665
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,165
AND THAT HE'S ENTITLED TO OUR

666
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:50,832
DEFERENCE.

667
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,000
THE MORE HE ACTS LIKE THIS, IT'S

668
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,835
GOING TO COME BACK TO BITE HIM

669
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,175

I DON'T THINK SO.

906
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,383
GETTING A COLD SORE, THAT'S

907
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,092
HERPES.

908
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,010
I HAVE NEVER HAD A COLD SORE.

909
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,637

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,618
IS THERE JUICE IN IT?

922
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,368

THE CHALLENGE, COCHRAN

927
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,211
DEFINITELY MADE A POINT OF

928
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,754
PUTTING ON A DISPLAY OF WORKING.

929
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,172
I'M TRYING TO PROVE MY WORTH

930
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,381
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

931
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,384
HE WORKED HARDER THAN I'VE

932
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,553
SEEN HIM WORK THE WHOLE TIME OUT

933
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,221

934
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,389

YOU KNOW.

936
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,725

00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,062
WEAKEST LINK, AND I THINK

939
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,396
EVERYBODY FEELS GOOD ABOUT

940
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,689
LETTING HIM GO TONIGHT.

941
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,106
SO THAT'S THE PLAN, RIGHT?

942
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,024
IT'S COCHRAN.

943
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,902
OKAY.

944
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,111
OZZY'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT HE

945
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,405
WANTS COCHRAN GONE, BUT IN MY

946
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,241
OPINION, IT'S TIME TO BREAK UP

947
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,076
THAT ALLIANCE WITH OZZY AND

948
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:28,743
ELYSE.

949
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,120
RIGHT NOW, I THINK YOU, ME,

950
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,997
AND JIM ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE

951
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,251
IN TERMS OF WANTING TO GET RID

952
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:36,876
OF ELYSE NEXT.

953
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,629
RIGHT, ELYSE HAS TO GO.

954
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,964
SHE'S FINE WITH ELYSE FIRST.

955
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,925
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHO THE

956
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,468
LINCHPIN IS GOING TO BE IS

957
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:45,802
KEITH.

958
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,094
REALLY?

959
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:46,553
YEAH.

960
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,262
OKAY.

961
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,430
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE COCHRAN AND

962
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,056
DAWN BUT IN A TRIBE OF SEVEN,

963
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:50,765
YOU NEED FOUR.

964
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,893
I GOTTA FIND THAT FOURTH VOTE TO

965
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,478
GET ELYSE OUT.

966
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,021
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU ABOUT

967
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,648
SOMETHING THAT CAME UP THAT I

968
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,357
DIDN'T LIKE.

969
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,110
SOMETHING KIND OF BIG, ACTUALLY.

970
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,154
IT RAISED MY EYEBROWS A LOT.

971
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,073
THE ONLY THING GOOD THAT CAME

972
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,116
OUT OF THE REDEMPTION ISLAND

973
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,784
INFORMATION IS I GOT A PIECE OF

974
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,619
FEAR THEY CAN PLANT IN KEITH TO

975
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,996
HELP HIM VOTE WITH ME AGAINST

976
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,956
ELYSE TONIGHT.

977
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,582
OZZY IS TALKING ABOUT COACH

978
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,334
NEEDS TO GET OUT ALBERT

979
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,085
BEFOREHAND.

980
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,128
AND I'M LIKE-- SO, IMMEDIATELY,

981
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,588
IF HE'S THINKING THAT COACH

982
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,298
NEEDS TO GET OUT ALBERT, THAT

983
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,007
MEANS HE'S THINKING HE NEEDS TO

984
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,342
GET OUT ONE OF US PREMERGE.

985
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,469
AND I DON'T-- HERE'S THE THING,

986
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,014
HE CAN'T DO IT-- LIKE COCHRAN IS

987
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,473
DRIVING ME FREAKING CRAZY.

988
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,474
I KNOW,.

989
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,019
BUT IF WE GET RID OF ELYSE

990
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,020
FIRST, HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

991
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,979
I KNOW.

992
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:38,646
I AGREE.

993
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,314
WE NEED ELYSE FIRST GONE.

994
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,024
KEITH AND I GET ON THE SAME

995
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,026
PAGE WITHIN ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

996
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,153
SO IT'S LOOKING PRETTY STRONGLY

997
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:50,033
LIKE ELYSE IS NEXT.

998
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,326
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

999
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,329
I DON'T THINK WE TELL OZZY.

1000
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,331
BUT THEN HE'S NOT GOING TO

1001
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,792
TRUST US.

1002
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,962
TONIGHT'S VOTE IS SUPPOSED TO GO

1003
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,507
JIM, DAWN, COCHRAN, AND THEY

1004
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,217
VOTE ELYSE, AND THEN ELYSE AND

1005
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,179
OZZY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR

1006
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:11,888
COCHRAN.

1007
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,848
SO THAT LEAVES ME AND WHITNEY

1008
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,307
FOR A LITTLE ROOM TO PLAY.

1009
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,018
WE GOTTA DO THAT.

1010
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,187
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN KIND OF DO

1011
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,854
WHATEVER WE WANT.

1012
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:21,147
THE FIRST ALLIANCE I MADE WAS

1013
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,691
ME AND OZZY, SO TONIGHT'S VOTE

1014
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,068
IS GOING TO BE REALLY SCARY

1015
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,528
BECAUSE ELYSE GETS BLINDSIDED,

1016
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,698
IN A SENSE, OZZY GETS

1017
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,366
BLINDSIDED.

1018
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,034
SO HOW IS OZZY GOING TO TRUST ME

1019
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,369
WHEN HE THINKS WE'RE ALL VOTING

1020
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,704
FOR COCHRAN?

1021
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,705
THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT I'M

1022
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,749
GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE

1023
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,542
OUT.

1024
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,544
AND YOU'RE, LIKE, 100%

1025
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,254
THINKING WE SHOULD GO WITH ELYSE

1026
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:45,838
NOW?

1027
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,006
YES, NO, I DON'T KNOW.

1028
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,675
YEAH, I JUST WANT TO MAKE

1029
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,676
SURE THAT WE'VE THOUGHT

1030
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,260
EVERYTHING THROUGH.

1031
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,054
ELYSE AND OZZY ARE LIKE THIS.

1032
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,264
AND I DON'T THINK OZZY'S GOING

1033
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,850
TO LIKE IT IF WE ALL VOTE HER

1034
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,395
OFF, AND THERE GOES OUR

1035
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,062
ALLIANCE.

1036
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,107
SO OZZY WANTS COCHRAN RIGHT

1037
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:04,774
NOW.

1038
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,567
WHAT ONE SO BAD IF WE VOTED

1039
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,026
COCHRAN OUT?

1040
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,694
I DON'T KNOW.

1041
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,071
SO IS IT BETTER TO GET ELYSE

1042
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:10,571
OUT NOW OR LATER?

1043
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,073
I DON'T KNOW.

1044
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:12,740
KEITH I ARE STILL TRYING TO

1045
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:17,620
FIGURE OUT HOW TO WEASEL OUR WAY

1046
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,081
AROUND THIS AND STILL COME OUT

1047
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,250
IN OUR ALLIANCE WITH OZZY.

1048
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,126
IT'S HARD.

1049
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,254
I WISH WE COULD LET THOSE THREE

1050
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,423
VOTE FOR ELYSE AND US TWO VOTE

1051
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,591
NOT COCHRAN, JUST SOMEONE ELSE.

1052
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,884
WE'RE ALL GOOD.

1053
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,802
ELYSE IS NEXT.

1054
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,219
REALLY?

1055
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,262
YEAH, YEAH.

1056
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,972
SERIOUSLY?

1057
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:36,723
100%.

1058
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,348
REALLY?

1059
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,808
FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M NOT

1060
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,475
FEELING THAT BAD ABOUT MY

1061
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,270
CHANCES GOING INTO TONIGHT'S

1062
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,020
TRIBAL.

1063
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,439
WORST-CASE SCENARIO, I GET SENT

1064
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,148
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1065
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,442
BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GET

1066
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,110
SENT TO REDEMPTION.

1067
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,111
I DON'T THINK IF OZZY THINKS WE

1068
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,280
ARE ALL AGAINST HIM.

1069
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,658
WE ARE ALL AGAINST HIM.

1070
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,744
HE WILL BE AGAINST ME WHEN WE

1071
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,289
VOTE OUT HIS HAMMOCK SWEETHEART.

1072
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,957
WHICH IS WHAT I HOPE WILL HAPPEN

1073
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:10,673
TONIGHT.

1074
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:15,136
Y

1075
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,305
Jeff: OZZY, WE'RE 14 DAYS

1076
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,264
IN, ROUGHLY A THIRD OF THE WAY

1077
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,475
INTO THE ADVENTURE.

1078
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,309
HAVING PLAYED TWICE BEFORE,

1079
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,686
WHERE ARE WE AT RIGHT NOW FROM A

1080
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,353
GAME POINT OF VIEW?

1081
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,439
YOU KNOW, A THIRD OF THE WAY

1082
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,982
IN, MERGE IS STILL TOO FAR OFF

1083
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:30,693
TO BE THAT WORRIED ABOUT IN

1084
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,402
TERMS OF THE TRUST OF THE GROUP.

1085
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,781
SO IT'S ALL ABOUT KEEPING US A

1086
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,364
STRONG AS POSSIBLE.

1087
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,242
Jeff: ELYSE, HOW DO YOU

1088
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:38,951
DEFINE A STRONG TRIBE MEMBER?

1089
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,496
I THINK IN THIS GAME A STRONG

1090
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,830
TRIBE MEMBER IS SOMEBODY WHO IS

1091
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,332
STRONG ACROSS THE BOARD.

1092
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,292
SO SOMEBODY WHO CAN DELIVER WHAT

1093
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,377
THEY'RE EXPECTED IN A CHALLENGE.

1094
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,129
SOMEBODY WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE

1095
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:50,797
AROUND CAMP LIFE.

1096
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,715
SOMEBODY WHO HAS GOT SOCIAL

1097
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,550
SKILLS AND GRACES THAT CAN HELP

1098
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,135
UNIFY PEOPLE, KEEPING THE GROUP

1099
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:56,677
TOGETHER.

1100
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,678
Jeff: COCHRAN, YOU'VE

1101
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,555
GOTTEN VOTES EVERY TIME WE'VE

1102
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,348
BEEN AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1103
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:00,973
RIGHT.

1104
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,225
Jeff: WHEN YOU HEAR ELYSE

1105
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,684
SAY I WANT SOMEBODY STRONG.

1106
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,853
DOES YOUR ANTENNA GO UP

1107
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,021
THINKING AM I ONCE AGAIN GOING

1108
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,689
TO BE GETTING VOTES BECAUSE MY

1109
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,232
LEGS AREN'T TREE TRUNKS?

1110
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:13,986
YEAH, THE NOVELTY OF

1111
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,695
ATTENDING TRIBAL COUNCIL HAS

1112
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,321
WORN OFF FOR ME.

1113
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,365
IN TERMS OF CHALLENGES,

1114
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,575
CHALLENGES RUN SUCH A HUGE GAMUT

1115
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,284
OF THINGS.

1116
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,869
I THINK WE ALL DID A FANTASTIC

1117
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,204
JOB AT TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

1118
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,540
IT CAME DOWN TO TWO OUNCES.

1119
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,999
THAT MADE IT ESPECIALLY

1120
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:27,583
DEVASTATING.

1121
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,835
Jeff: TWO OUNCES IS ONE

1122
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:29,836
EXTRA WIGHT.

1123
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:30,294
JIM, WAS THERE ANY GOING BACK

1124
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,129
OVER THINKING--

1125
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,714
EVERY SUCCESS ONE OF US DID

1126
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,717
BECAUSE WE ALL SAY WE GAVE 100%

1127
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:42,098
BUT THEN IT'S LIKE

1128
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:42,807
WOULDA-COULD-A-SHOULD-A.

1129
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,558
THIS WAS ONE WHERE IRONICALLY

1130
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,226
ENOUGH WE ALL HAD MORE INJURIES

1131
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,228
DURING THIS CHALLENGE THAN ANY

1132
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,729
OF OUR OTHER CHALLENGES

1133
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,397
COMBINED.

1134
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:49,897
Jeff: GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN.

1135
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,399
WHO HAS AN INJURY.

1136
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:51,983
FROM TODAY'S CHALLENGE?

1137
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,069
FROM TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

1138
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,404
Jeff: JIM, WHAT'S YOUR

1139
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,071
INJURY.

1140
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,865
I HAVE A BUN OF CUTS IN MY

1141
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,240
MOUTH.

1142
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,785
Jeff: ELYSE.

1143
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,244
CUTS.

1144
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,204
Jeff: DAWN.

1145
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,915
BROKEN TOOTH.

1146
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,083
Jeff: WHITNEY?

1147
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,751
JUST LIPS.

1148
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,752
Jeff: COCHRAN.

1149
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,922
I HAVEN'T BEEN WEARING MY

1150
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,757
RETAINER AS A SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

1151
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,092
I DEFINITELY FELT MY TEETH

1152
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:18,676
SHIFTING.

1153
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,343
Jeff: COCHRAN, ARE YOU

1154
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:24,223
BEING SILLY OR ARE YOU 100%

1155
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:24,891
SINCERE.

1156
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:25,766
I'M WARPING THE ARRANGEMENT

1157
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,350
OF MY TEETH.

1158
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,393
Jeff: SMILE, LET ME SEE.

1159
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,477
THAT'S NOT A SMILE.

1160
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,313
IT'S A GRIMACE, BUT...

1161
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,273
Jeff: DAWN, COCHRAN'S NEED

1162
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,441
TO ASSESS AND REASSESS, THAT'S

1163
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,484
NOT A SMILE, THAT'S A GRIMACE.

1164
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,612
HIGHWAY OFTEN IS THAT CHARMING

1165
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,573
AND HOW OFTEN IS IT ANNOYING?

1166
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,408
I THINK COCHRAN'S ENDEARING.

1167
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,784
HE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CHARACTER

1168
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,453
TO ME, BUT I THINK THIS IS ALSO

1169
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,579
A GAME ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE

1170
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,289
TOGETHER THAT WOULD NEVER BE

1171
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:48,998
TOGETHER.

1172
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,333
SO PART OF ME IS LEARNING TO BE

1173
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,000
REALLY TOLERANT.

1174
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,667
LIKE TODAY WHEN WE CAME BACK

1175
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,460
FROM THE CHALLENGE, HE SAID

1176
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,462
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY WE COULD

1177
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,922
HAVE SOME COMMUNICABLE DISEASE

1178
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:56,547
BECAUSE WE ALL HAD OUR MOUTHS

1179
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,257
AGAINST THE SPIT.

1180
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,967
AND I JUST THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW

1181
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,928
WHERE YOU GET THAT.

1182
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,804
IT WAS JUST HILARIOUS BUT NOT.

1183
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,890
Jeff: KEITH, EVERYBODY ELSE

1184
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,682
WAS KIND OF LAUGHING.

1185
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,975
YOU HAD A DIFFERENT REACTION.

1186
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,102
YEAH, IT WAS NASTY.

1187
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:10,728
I DON'T WANT A SUPPOSED DISEASE

1188
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,647
FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH.

1189
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,482
YEAH, THE INTENTIONS WERE TO

1190
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,692
MAYBE MAKE EVERYONE LAUGH, BUT I

1191
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,485
THINK IN THE END, YEAH, IT

1192
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,486
GROSSED EVERYONE OUT.

1193
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,155
Jeff: COCHRAN, YOU CAN'T

1194
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,323
CATCH A BREAK.

1195
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,824
IT'S HORRIBLE.

1196
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,951
IT'S-- IT'S DEVASTATING.

1197
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,661
I KNOW THESE ARE KIND OF

1198
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,828
LIGHT-HEARTED COMMENTS, BUT THEY

1199
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,913
DO HURT.

1200
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,165
I MEAN TRIBAL COUNCIL IS ALWAYS

1201
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,333
LIKE NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO BE

1202
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,084
BETTER.

1203
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:33,668
I COULD OBSESS ABOUT EVERYTHING

1204
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,502
I DO OUT HERE--

1205
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,670
AND PROBABLY WILL TONIGHT.

1206
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,129
I PROBABLY WILL TONIGHT IF

1207
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,506
THERE IS A TONIGHT.

1208
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,299
Jeff: ELYSE, CAN YOU FEEL

1209
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,008
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE COCHRAN?

1210
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,551
OH, I CAN COMPLETELY FEEL FOR

1211
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,260
COCHRAN.

1212
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,387
I KNOW THAT IT'S HARD TO BE IN A

1213
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,472
POSITION WHERE PEOPLE ARE

1214
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,140
LOOKING AT YOU AND POINTING OUT

1215
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,016
THINGS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO

1216
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,725
HEAR.

1217
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,352
I MEAN, WE'VE ALL BEEN IN THAT

1218
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,019
POSITION.

1219
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,479
WE'VE ALL BEEN PICKED LAST FOR

1220
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,563
SOCCER OUT ON THE PLAYGROUND,

1221
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,147
YOU KNOW.

1222
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,524
Jeff: COCHRAN, ARE YOU

1223
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,651
TYPICALLY PICKED LAST FOR

1224
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,235
SOCCER?

1225
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,194
I DON'T PUT MYSELF IN A

1226
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:01,696
POSITION WHERE I'M PLAYING

1227
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,154
SOCCER.

1228
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:02,863
( LAUGHTER ).

1229
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,532
BUT ALL THENEROSES AND SELF-DEP

1230
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,909
RAICATION ASIDE, I THINK I GET

1231
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,536
ALONG WELL WITH PEOPLE.

1232
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,913
I MAY HAVE CERTAIN QUIRKS THAT

1233
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,207
PEOPLE FIND ACNIG, BUT THAT

1234
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:13,874
ASIDE, I THINK PEOPLE, OR AT

1235
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,501
LEAST A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE,

1236
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,919
DO TAKE TO ME.

1237
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,671
Jeff: ELYSE, GIVEN

1238
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,339
EVERYTHING THAT COCHRAN'S GONE

1239
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,382
THROUGH, THE LAST TWO TRIBAL

1240
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,049
COUNCILS AND AGAIN TONIGHT,

1241
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,427
WOULD IT BE HARD TO VOTE HIM

1242
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,136
OUT?

1243
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,887
ONE THING TO APPRECIATE ABOUT

1244
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,890
HIM IS THAT HE SO LOVES AND

1245
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,393
KNOWS THE GAME THAT WHETHER HE

1246
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,060
STAYS, WHETHER HE GOES TO

1247
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,437
REDEMPTION ISLAND, HE'S GOING TO

1248
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,564
APPRECIATE THE EXPERIENCE.

1249
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,524
Jeff: JIM, IS THERE

1250
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,193
ANYTHING ABOUT THE VOTE THAT'S

1251
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,070
PERSONAL OR IS IT ABSOLUTELY

1252
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:43,738
STRATEGY?

1253
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,406
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALWAYS A

1254
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,407
PERSONAL ELEMENT TO IT.

1255
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,742
SO EVEN WHEN I GO BACK THERE AND

1256
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,243
WRITE DOWN A NAME THAT'S IN MY

1257
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:52,079
MIND 100% STRATEGIC, IT'S STILL

1258
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,914
PERSONAL BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IT'S

1259
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,583
GOING TO AFFECT THAT PERSON WHEN

1260
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,545
THEY SEE THEIR NAME ON THERE.

1261
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,422
Jeff: OKAY, IT IS TIME TO

1262
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:01,922
VOTE.

1263
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:10,556
JIM, YOU'RE UP.

1264
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,601
SORRY, ELYSE, THIS HAS MORE

1265
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:28,115
TO DO WITH KEEPING OZZY WEAK.

1266
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,242
THIS IS THE SECOND-TO HISTORY

1267
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,327
LAST STOP ON THE TRAIN.

1268
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,036
SORRY, MAN.

1269
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,872
HOPE YOU GET THAT SECOND CHANCE.

1270
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,763
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1271
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:57,686
VOTES.

1272
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,604
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1273
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,688
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1274
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,482
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1275
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,736
TO DO SO.

1276
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,530
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1277
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,572
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1278
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,157
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1279
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:10,658
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1280
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,200
IMMEDIATELY.

1281
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:15,621
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1282
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:22,002
FIRST VOTE, COCHRAN.

1283
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,547
ELYSE.

1284
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,923
COCHRAN.

1285
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,341
THAT'S TWO VOTES COCHRAN, ONE

1286
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:30,344
VOTE ELYSE.

1287
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:31,011
ELYSE.

1288
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,513
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES COCHRAN,

1289
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,642
TWO VOTES ELYSE.

1290
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,059
DAWN.

1291
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:43,065
ONE VOTE DAWN.

1292
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,191
DAWN, WE'RE TIED.

1293
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,734
TWO VOTES DAWN, TWO VOTES

1294
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,361
COCHRAN, TWO VOTES ELYSE, ONE

1295
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,697
VOTE LEFT.

1296
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,493
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1297
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,537
"SURVIVOR: SOUTH PACIFIC"

1298
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,204
ELYSE.

1299
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:05,713
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1300
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:10,509
ELYSE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1301
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,886
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

1302
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,221
BACK IN THIS GAME.

1303
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,097
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

1304
