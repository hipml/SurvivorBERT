1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:06,256
>> PREVIOUSLY ON SURVIVOR.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,716
>> SO FAR, MATT HAS BEEN THE

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,259
ONLY PERSON TO FIND REDEMPTION

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,760
AT REDEMPTION ISLAND.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,469
>> MATT STAYS ALIVE.

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,221
>> HE HAS WON ALL THREE DUELS.

7
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,307
>> GRAB YOUR STUFF
AND AWAIT YOUR NEXT OPPONENT.

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,103
>> AT MATT'S OLD TRIBE PHILLIP
IS DRIVING EVERYONE CRAZY.

9
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,230
>> IT'S SERIOUSLY
HURTING MY EYES.

10
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,442
>> SO ROB ACTUALLY CONSIDERED
KEEPING HIM AROUND FOR A WHILE.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,902
>> AS LONG AS PHILLIP IS
AGGRAVATING EVERYBODY SO MUCH,

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,155
IT TAKES ALL
OF THE HEAT OFF OF ME.

13
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,531
MAYBE HE NEEDS TO STAY.

14
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,786
>> SINCE THROWING A CHALLENGE
TO GET RID OF RUSSELL --

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,288
>> THIS IS MY LAST TIME
PLAYING THIS GAME.

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,123
>> THE ZAPATERA LOOKS LIKE THEY
LOST THEIR MOJO

17
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,959
AND WERE BICKERING
AMONG THEMSELVES.

18
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,754
>> DAVID UNDER PRESSURE
IS REALLY STRESSFUL.

19
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,464
>> DON'T EVEN GO THERE
WITH THAT.

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,965
I DON'T FREAK OUT.

21
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,468
>> AND EVEN THOUGH SARITA IS
WEARING THIN ON HER TRIBE MATES

22
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,303
THE BIGGER TARGETS
WERE KRISTA AND STEPHANIE.

23
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,139
>> THERE IS NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

24
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,141
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, KRISTEN
AND STEPHANIE VOTED FOR STEVE

25
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,519
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE VOTED KRISTA.

26
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,563
>> KRISTA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

27
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,316
>> Jeff: NOW STEPHANIE HAS TO

28
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,027
SCRAMBLE TO AVOID BEING THE NEXT

29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,946
PERSON SENT TO REDEMPTION
ISLAND.

30
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,830
>> MATT?

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,289
>> WHO IS IT?

32
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,167
>> IT'S KRISTA.

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,210
ARE YOU DRY UNDER THERE?

34
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,462
>> YEAH, FOR SURE.

35
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,505
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'M DEFINITELY

36
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,173
COMING UNDER THERE WITH YOU.

37
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,010
I WAS EXCITED, I SAW HIM IN
THE DUAL AND HE HAS SUCH A

38
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:38,014
POSITIVE ATTITUDE, JUST
REFRESHING, I GUESS YOU COULD

39
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:42,143
SAY, EVEN WITH, WITHIN THE FIRST
FIVE MINUTES I FEEL HE HAS SO

40
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,146
MUCH MORE SUBSTANCE THAN THE
PEOPLE I HAVE BEEN ON THE TRIBE

41
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,357
FOR THE LAST 14 DAYS.

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,441
YOU PRAY A LOT?

43
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,652
>> YEAH, YEAH.

44
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,195
I HAVE BEEN -- WHENEVER I CAN.

45
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,282
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
GOD PUT ME HERE.

46
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,868
>> ME, TOO.

47
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,537
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,373
THAT I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU
A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY.

49
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,416
>> OH, TRUST ME, I KNOW YOU ARE.

50
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,546
>> KRISTA CAME IN TONIGHT, I WAS
PRETTY EXCITED TO SEE HER AT

51
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,715
FIRST, BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED
THAT SHE IS A FIRECRACKER

52
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,551
AND SHE IS HERE FOR BUSINESS.

53
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,053
>> YOU ARE NOT SNEAKING UNDER
THE RADAR, BLONDIE.

54
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,429
>> NEITHER ARE YOU, BLONDIE.

55
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,432
>> HEY!

56
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,077
>> TOO BAD.

57
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,913
YOU MUST HAVE A LOT
OF FAITH IN PEOPLE.

58
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,584
TRIBAL LAST NIGHT GOT A
LITTLE UGLY BUT IN THE END

59
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,253
KRISTA WAS OUR VOTE,
AND TO MY SURPRISE,

60
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,591
KRISTA AND STEPHANIE
BOTH VOTED FOR ME.

61
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,302
THAT WAS KIND OF
A COLD SLAP OF REALITY.

62
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,642
>> PLAYING A TEAM --

63
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,147
>> IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU PER SE.

64
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,568
IT IS ABOUT KEEPING THE TEAM
WITH THE STRONGEST COMPETITORS.

65
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:18,865
I KNOW YOU ARE DIGGING DEEP BUT
IT MIGHT NOT BE THERE TO GIVE.

66
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,451
>> I WAS TRYING TO BE DELICATE.

67
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,663
I AM GOING TO, YOU KNOW, NOT BE

68
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,625
TOO CRAZY ABOUT BASHING PEOPLE.

69
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,252
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET SENT TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND AND RIGHT NOW

70
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,422
I AM AT THE BOTTOM, AS MUCH AS I
HATE SUCKING IT UP WITH PEOPLE

71
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,634
WHO ARE COMPLETE -- I WILL DO IT

72
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,261
BECAUSE I WANT TO GET
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

73
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,140
>> I'M SORRY YOU ARE PERSONALLY
OFFENDED THAT I VOTED FOR YOU.

74
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,767
>> IT IS CRAZY.

75
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,770
WHERE I COME FROM, 13 YEARS IN
THE NFL AND IT IS A GUT CHECK I

76
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,481
AM DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE
TO DIG DEEPER, BUT HER VOTE

77
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,610
AGAINST ME LAST NIGHT,
I CONSIDER IT STUPID.

78
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,821
>> I THINK IT WAS ANOTHER
POOR MOVE YOU HAVE MADE.

79
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,989
>> IT'S OKAY.

80
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:00,990
>> IN ALLIANCES.

81
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,033
>> IT'S OKAY.

82
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:02,992
I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOUR OPINION

83
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,664
AND IF THAT IS YOUR OPINION,
THAT'S FINE.

84
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,999
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR
EXPLAINING.

85
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,921
>> SHE IS BASICALLY TIGHTENING
THE ROPE AROUND HER NECK.

86
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,549
IF WE HAVE TO GO BACK
TO TRIBAL SHE IS OUT.

87
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,697
>> WE SHOULD HAVE
ANOTHER BEACH DAY.

88
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,909
>> I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH NATALIE.

89
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,494
I'M REALLY SCARED RIGHT NOW.

90
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,538
>> OW!

91
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,539
>> SORRY.

92
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,875
>> OW!

93
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,585
>> NATALIE AND I KIND OF STARTED

94
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,088
A LITTLE SPA TODAY, WE ARE LIKE

95
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,550
CLIPPING OUR LEG HAIRS
AND LIKE FIXING OUR EYEBROWS.

96
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,802
>> LIKE WHAT ARE WE
DOING RIGHT NOW?

97
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,764
>> ROB'S MAKING A DAY BED.

98
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,225
ANDREA IS PRETENDING TO HELP.

99
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,227
PHILLIP IS ALWAYS
CHECKING ON THE FIRE.

100
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,897
LIKE EVERY 20, 30 MINUTES.

101
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,399
HOWEVER YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF

102
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,235
SEEM MORE COMFORTABLE, WHY NOT?

103
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,695
I WORKED HARD ALL OF MY LIFE,

104
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,739
I WAS A BASKETBALL PLAYER,
IN PAGEANTS,

105
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,407
IT IS NOT LIKE I AM LAZY,

106
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,952
NATALIE AND I HAVE JUST
BEEN HANGING.

107
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,578
>> YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
A BRAIDY BRAID?

108
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,579
>> YEAH. COME SIT DOWN.

109
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,580
>> OKAY.

110
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,581
>> WHAT YOU GUYS DOING?
HAIR?

111
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,582
>> OH, YEAH.

112
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,044
>> I NEED A FRENCH BRAID
IN THESE DREADS.

113
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,545
RIGHT DOWN THE SIDE.

114
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,588
AND A PART RIGHT HERE.

115
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,714
>> GIVE ME THE SCISSORS.

116
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,382
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT
REAL QUICK.

117
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,592
>> YOU ARE NOT COMING NEAR ME.

118
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,593
>> I WILL GET YOU
WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING.

119
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,095
>> GIRLS, I HAVE A REQUEST.

120
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,263
>> WHAT'S THAT?

121
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:47,930
>> WHAT?

122
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,141
>> AND THAT IS EVERY HALF AN

123
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,726
HOUR OR SO, CHECK ON THE FIRE.

124
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,227
>> YOU KNOW, I DO THAT.

125
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,228
>> I KNOW YOU DO.

126
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,396
>> I AM NOT SINGLING YOU OUT.

127
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,397
>> RIGHT.

128
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,106
>> I AM JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, I

129
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,275
HAVE BEEN OVER THERE LIKE FOUR

130
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,610
OR FIVE TIMES THIS MORNING JUST

131
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,111
DOING IT, SO WHAT I WANT TO TRY

132
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,280
TO DO LIKE EVERY 25 MINUTES,

133
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,490
HALF AN HOUR YOU WORK IT OUT

134
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,283
AMONGST YOURSELF BECAUSE WE HAVE

135
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:07,617
WET WOOD HERE
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

136
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,786
>> OKAY.

137
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,120
>> I HAVE IT STOKING RIGHT NOW.

138
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,246
>> THANK YOU, PHILLIP.

139
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,290
>> THANKS PHILLY.

140
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,668
>> IF I GO TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

141
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,630
BEFORE ASHLEY AND NATALIE, THERE

142
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,631
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE

143
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,300
GAME, BECAUSE THOSE TWO GIRLS,

144
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,760
THEY ARE ON A BEAUTY PAGEANT.

145
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,303
>> THAT'S THEIR WHOLE WORLD, BUT

146
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,013
IT IS HARD TO COMPETE AND DO

147
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,389
ANYTHING WHEN YOU HAVE TWO GIRLS

148
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,390
WHO WON'T GET OFF THEIR BUTTS

149
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,977
AND WON'T GIVE YOU
REAL CREDIT FOR ANYTHING.

150
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,979
IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN SOMEBODY

151
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,148
WHO DON'T LIKE DOGS HAD A DOG.

152
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,400
YOU HAVE SEEN THAT.

153
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,988
I AM THEIR REDHEADED
STEPCHILD.

154
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,157
THESE TWO GIRLS MUST GO.

155
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,034
THEY HAVE BEEN HERE 14 DAYS

156
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,662
AND FRANKLY,
THE PAGEANT IS OVER.

157
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,997
>> I HAVE A HEADACHE.

158
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,416
>> I HAVE A STOMACHACHE.

159
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,678
>> LOOK AT HER COMFORT.

160
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,179
>> IT IS REALLY EXCITING.

161
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,681
>> AWESOME.

162
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,516
>> GREAT.

163
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,851
>> IT WAS GREAT GETTING MY

164
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,644
LUXURY ITEM, PROVIDED SOME

165
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,646
COMFORT AND JUST SOME STRENGTH

166
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,690
OF WORDS OF WISDOM AND NICE,

167
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,109
STRONG RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE LORD.

168
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:27,405
>> IT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN'T
FIND ANYWHERE ELSE.

169
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,574
>> WE GIVE THIS DAY TO YOU,

170
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,035
LORD, AND WE KNOW WHATEVER THE

171
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,413
OUTCOME IS THAT IT WILL BRING

172
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,664
HONOR TO YOU, LORD AND WE THANK

173
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,167
YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING US BE

174
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,710
HERE TOGETHER ON REDEMPTION
ISLAND, LORD, AND HELP US TO

175
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,753
CARRY ON, HONORING YOU.

176
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,881
>> AMEN.

177
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,048
>> AMEN.

178
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,550
>> KRISTA IS DIFFERENT FROM THE

179
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,343
OTHER COMPETITORS I HAVE FACED,

180
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,012
FOR ONE KEY REASON, IT IS BOTH

181
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,221
OF US HAVE REALLY BEEN

182
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,431
STRUGGLING WITH NOT HAVING A

183
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,682
FAITH COMMUNITY AND OTHER

184
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,559
BELIEVERS TO KIND OF LEAN ON AND

185
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,729
TALK WITH ABOUT OUR BELIEFS
AND HOW WE FEEL.

186
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,730
>> IT CERTAINLY MAKES IT A LOT

187
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,607
MORE DIFFICULT
TO COMPETE WITH HER.

188
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,609
LAST SCOOP'S FOR YOU.

189
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,402
>> OH.

190
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,069
>> I DEFINITELY HAVE A LITTLE

191
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,363
ANXIETY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

192
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,450
THAT THIS COULD BE MY LAST DAY.

193
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,758
>> COME ON IN.

194
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:33,429
>> ANDREA, AND NATALIE,
TAKE A SEAT.

195
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:38,059
JULIE AND MIKE, PICK A SPOT
AND GET TO THIS.

196
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:42,271
>> WE ARE NOW BRINGING THE
COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S DUAL.

197
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,943
>> MATT WILL BE BATTLING AGAINST

198
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,946
KRISTA, VOTED OUT AT
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

199
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,575
>> YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO IT?

200
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,576
>> YES.

201
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,577
>> ABSOLUTELY.

202
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,578
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S DUAL YOU

203
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,622
WILL USE A GRAPPLING HOOK
TO GET THREE BAGS.

204
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,791
EACH BAG CONTAINS A BALL, ONCE

205
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,502
YOU HAVE ALL THREE BAGS YOU WILL

206
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,129
USE ONE BALL TO SOLVE
THE TABLE MAZE.

207
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,632
>> FIRST PERSON TO GET IT RIGHT

208
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,467
STAYS ALIVE IN THIS GAME.

209
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,636
>> LOSER IS OUT.

210
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,679
THEIR QUEST FOR A MILLION
DOLLARS KAPUT.

211
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,806
THIS IS IT.

212
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,807
ONE SHOT.

213
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,059
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

214
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,108
>> ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.

215
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,110
IT IS DO OR DIE TIME.

216
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,320
SURVIVORS READY.

217
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,990
GO.

218
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,868
>> YOU HAVE TO RETRIEVE THREE
BAGS USING THE GRAPPLING HOOK

219
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,372
AND STAY ON THE PLATFORM
WHILE DOING IT.

220
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,081
>> MATT WITH THE FIRST TOSS.

221
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,041
>> CAN HE HOOK THE FIRST BAG?

222
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,834
>> JUST MISSES.

223
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,962
>> KRISTA REALLY TAKING
HER TIME.

224
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,715
>> GREAT FIRST TOSS AND WITH ONE

225
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,468
TOSS KRISTA HAS SECURED
HER FIRST BAG.

226
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,014
>> MATT WITH A NICE TOSS.

227
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,682
MATT HAS HIS FIRST BAG.

228
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,268
GENTLY PULLING IT BACK.

229
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,894
DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE IT.

230
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,480
>> KRISTA READIES
HER SECOND TOSS.

231
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,192
>> ANOTHER GREAT TOSS BY KRISTA.

232
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,695
>> TWO TOSSES, TWO BAGS.

233
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,905
>> MATT NOW PANICKING.

234
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,367
>> MATT WITH A NICE TOSS.

235
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,871
CAN HE SECURE A BAG?
IT LOOKS GOOD.

236
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,541
MATT WITH HIS SECOND BAG.

237
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,169
KRISTA HAS MADE THREE THROWS AND

238
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:32,048
WITH THREE TOSSES SHE HAS
GRABBED ALL THREE BAGS.

239
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,883
KRISTA NOW UNWRAPPING.

240
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,218
GET ONE BALL AND START WORKING
ON THE TABLE MAZE.

241
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,887
>> MATT HAS ONE BAG LEFT.

242
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,930
>> BIG ADVANTAGE FOR KRISTA.

243
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,641
THIS COULD DO IT
IF HE CAN HOOK IT.

244
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,103
GOT IT.

245
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,688
GOT TO GET IT BACK.

246
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,398
KRISTA HAS HER BALL AND SHE IS

247
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,900
GOING TO START WORKING.

248
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,694
MATT HAS HIS THIRD BAG AND STILL

249
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,904
LOOKING FOR ONE BALL.

250
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,197
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED.

251
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,991
>> MATT, YOU NEED TO GET
THAT BAG ON.

252
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,455
>> MATT HAS HIS BALL AND WORKING
ON THE TABLE MAZE.

253
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,956
IT IS NOT A SIMPLE MAZE.

254
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,875
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES

255
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,794
THAT BALL CAN FALL INTO A HOLE

256
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,380
AND YOU WILL HAVE TO START OVER.

257
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,215
MATT IS GOING TO HAVE
TO PICK IT UP NOW.

258
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,801
HE DROPS IN A HOLE AND HAS
TO START OVER.

259
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,761
KRISTA COMING UP
ON A TOUGH SPOT.

260
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,097
SHE GETS BY IT.

261
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,890
BOTH MATT AND KRISTA
STILL ALIVE.

262
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,934
KRISTA TOOK AN EARLY LEAD AND

263
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,936
HAS HELD IT THROUGHOUT THIS DUAL

264
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,439
BUT MATT IS CATCHING UP FAST.

265
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,650
MATT IS BY ONE OF THE TOUGHER

266
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,943
SPOTS ONLY TO FIND ANOTHER ONE

267
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,278
AND HE GETS BY THAT ONE.

268
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,740
KRISTA WITH ANOTHER VERY
DIFFICULT SPOT TO GET BY.

269
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,325
SHE IS STILL IN IT.

270
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,954
>> WE ARE NECK AND NECK
IN THIS DUAL.

271
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,872
MATT WITH A NICE JOB.

272
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,291
MATT NOW HAS THE LEAD
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

273
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,752
KRISTA CONTINUES TO FIGHT.

274
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,963
MATT HAS A TOUGH SPOT TO

275
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,799
NAVIGATE, CLOSE TO THE FINISH.

276
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:00,970
KRISTA FALLS IN THE HOLE.

277
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,639
SHE HAS TO START OVER AGAIN.

278
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,641
MATT VERY CLOSE.

279
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,892
GOT TO GET IT IN THAT NETTING.

280
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,024
MATT STAYS ALIVE!

281
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,828
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING, KRISTA?

282
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,871
>> IT IS A REAL REALITY RIGHT

283
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,499
NOW THAT THE GAME IS OVER.

284
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,544
SO IT IS EMOTIONAL.

285
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,713
>> WELL, KRISTA, YOU LASTED A

286
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,506
LONG TIME IN THIS GAME.

287
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,175
YOU ARE OUT OF THE GAME
FOR GOOD.

288
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,219
>> YOU CAN DROP YOUR BUFF
ON THE WAY OUT.

289
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,849
>> YEAH.

290
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,143
>> HE'S A TOUGH COOKIE, BUT --

291
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,354
>> WHAT IS THAT, KRISTA.

292
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,647
>> A LUXURY ITEM.

293
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,815
>> MY BIBLE.

294
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,358
>> I DON'T HAVE MINE SO SHE IS

295
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,443
KIND ENOUGH TO LEAVE IT WITH ME.

296
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,154
>> IS THAT SOMETHING THE TWO
OF YOU GUYS SHARED?

297
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:00,988
>> YEAH.

298
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,907
>> YOU KNOW, MATT
IS AN EXTREMELY

299
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,618
STRONG BELIEVER AND I THINK, YOU

300
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,036
KNOW, THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE

301
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,163
REASONS HE IS DOING
SO WELL OUT THERE.

302
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,874
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, KRISTA.

303
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,877
>> BYE.

304
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,340
>> MATT AND I AGREED AT THE END

305
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,174
OF THE DUAL TODAY IT WOULD BE

306
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,385
GOD'S WILL THAT WAS DONE
AND IT WAS.

307
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,930
IT WAS MY TIME TO GO.

308
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,101
>> KRISTA LEFT HER BIBLE
TO ME AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW

309
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:35,064
MUCH THAT MEANT TO ME, BECAUSE
THAT BOOK JUST BREATHES LIFE.

310
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,150
I CAN NEVER THANK HER ENOUGH.

311
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,947
>> Jeff: MATT, ONCE AGAIN,
YOU SEIZED THE MOMENT.

312
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,907
FOUR DUELS, FOUR WINS.

313
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,743
YOU CAN HEAD BACK TO REDEMPTION

314
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,203
AND AWAIT YOUR NEXT OPPONENT.

315
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,205
>> THANKS.

316
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,584
>> KRISTA GAVE HIM HER LUXURY

317
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,294
ITEM, A BIBLE ON HER WAY OUT,

318
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,088
AND THEY WERE SO CLOSE, AND THEN

319
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,591
MY WHOLE IMAGE OF MATT CHANGED.

320
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,261
I HAD A GOOD VIBE WITH HIM BUT

321
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,096
OBVIOUSLY HE BONDED
WITH KRISTA JUST AS WELL.

322
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,224
SO EVEN THOUGH INITIALLY I WANT
MATT TO STAY IN AS LONG AS

323
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,728
POSSIBLE, HE CAN BE A VERY
DANGEROUS AS WELL.

324
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,338
>> IS YOUR TOOTH BOTHERING YOU?

325
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,048
>> YEAH.
IT'S NOT MY TOOTH.

326
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,175
I CLEANED IT A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

327
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,429
AND I GOT BACTERIA IN IT.

328
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,514
IT WILL GO AWAY.

329
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,892
>> IT HURTS.

330
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,478
>> POOR SARITA, SHE THOUGHT SHE

331
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,939
HAD A CAVITY AND SAID SOME

332
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,442
BACTERIA GOT INTO IT, I DON'T
KNOW HOW SHE KNOWS THAT.

333
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:05,613
SHE IS KIND OF A DRAMA QUEEN
PRINCESS.

334
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,202
>> SARITA, SHE IS A TWO-FACED

335
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,372
GIRL FOR THIS KIND OF GAME.

336
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,750
SHE CLEANED HER TEETH
WITH A PIECE OF DIRTY STICK

337
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,168
AND GOUGED HER GUM.

338
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,546
THAT'S A GOOD WAY
TO REALLY GET OUT OF

339
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,506
THE GAME ON YOUR OWN.

340
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,216
OUT HERE, EVERYTHING IS NASTY,

341
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,594
AND STICKING STUFF LIKE THAT
IN HER MOUTH.

342
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,638
I MEAN WHO IN GOD'S NAME WOULD

343
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,348
WORRY ABOUT YOUR BACK TEETH.

344
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,058
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

345
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,852
SARITA'S WEARING ON ME.

346
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,520
>> SARITA IS GOING NUTS TOO.

347
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,188
>> I MEAN, OH, MY GOD.

348
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,733
>> YES, REALLY IS.

349
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,196
>> YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO UNSEAT HER IN THE GROUP.

350
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,157
>> BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY, IF IT

351
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,495
IS ME IN A FIGHT WITH THEM,
I WILL SHOOT MYSELF.

352
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,373
>> STEPHANIE IS A
CAPABLE COMPETITOR IN THE

353
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,541
CHALLENGES AND I THINK
UNQUESTIONABLY

354
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,378
SARITA IS THE WEAKEST PLAYER
IN THE TRIBE.

355
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,173
>> IF THERE IS A WAY TO GET
STEPHANIE TO BE MORE A PART

356
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,217
OF THE GROUP
AND ULTIMATELY KEEP HER

357
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,888
I WOULD DO THAT
TO SACRIFICE SARITA.

358
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,057
SO I THINK YOU, IN THE SENSE

359
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,393
THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF

360
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,227
TIME, YOU SHOULD TRY AND TALK TO

361
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,854
EVERYONE INDIVIDUALLY TODAY.

362
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,232
>> I MEAN YOU CANNOT
BE PUSHY ABOUT IT.

363
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,274
>> I CAN'T BE PUSHY AT ALL.

364
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,861
>> I'M GONNA GO HAUL
SOME WOOD IN.

365
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,606
> I SEE THE CLOUDS COMING IN,

366
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,275
PROBABLY GOING TO GET AN EARLY
RAIN LIKE WE DID LAST NIGHT.

367
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:10,279
I CONSIDER THIS THE CALM
BEFORE THE STORM.

368
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,282
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED

369
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,284
WITH NATALIE AND ASHLEY, THEY

370
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,994
LAY AROUND WHEN THEY SEE THAT

371
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,495
THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE, THAT I

372
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,247
MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE
SOME ASSISTANCE.

373
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,957
>> HE DOESN'T ASK.

374
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,250
HE SAID, "START GATHERING WOOD."

375
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:28,130
THAT IS NOT ASKING,
THAT IS DICTATING.

376
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,257
>> AND THE GIRLS ARE GETTING THE
FRUITS OF MY LABOR BUT THEY ARE

377
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,929
NOT GIVING ME ONE IOTA
OF CREDIT FOR IT, ZERO.

378
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,767
>> AND I AM NOT GOING TO STAY
THERE AND SAY, GIRLS, CAN'T YOU

379
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,393
SEE HOW HARD I AM WORKING,
GIVE ME SOME LOVE TOO.

380
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,605
I AM NOT GOING TO PLAY
THAT GAME.

381
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,814
>> WHAT CAN THE GIRLS DO?

382
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,190
WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO DO?

383
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,317
>> NOTHING.

384
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,985
BUT THEY ARE 19, 20-YEAR-OLD

385
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,904
GIRLS, THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO DO ANYTHING.

386
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,156
>> THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO
ANYTHING.

387
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,118
>> AND I AM NOT GOING TO BE
THE ONE TO TRY AND TELL THEM.

388
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,454
>> I AM NOT GOING
TO SUGARCOAT IT ANYMORE.

389
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,457
>> IT IS LIKE I ASKED YOU GUYS
FOUR TIMES TO HELP OUT WITH THE

390
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,709
WOOD, YOU HAVE BEEN
LIKE STATUES STANDING HERE.

391
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,336
>> WHY DO YOU TALK TO THE GIRLS

392
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,338
A CERTAIN WAY BUT NOTHING
TO THE GUYS.

393
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,381
>> I DO.
IN FACT I SAID WOULD YOU HELP

394
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,009
GATHER WOOD AND THEY IMMEDIATELY
STARTED DOING IT.

395
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,260
>> AM I WRONG?

396
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,513
>> DID YOU ASK THEM A DIFFERENT
WAY, YOU COME UP TO US AND SAY,

397
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,348
"STORM IS COMING, GATHER WOOD."

398
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,682
>> I AM TIRED OF IT.

399
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,352
>> I TELL YOU WHAT,
TOMORROW I AM FIRE FREE DAY.

400
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,561
>> I WON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING

401
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,522
TO THE BOYS BECAUSE THEY PULL
THEIR WEIGHT.

402
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,399
WE PULL OUR WEIGHT
AND SO DOES ANDREA.

403
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,861
>> SHE MAKES IT RIGHT AND GOES

404
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,863
GET WATER AND DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE TOLD.

405
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,573
YOU LAY HERE LIKE BEAUTY QUEENS.

406
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,285
>> I AM TIRED OF BEING
THE RED STEPCHILD TO YOU TOO.

407
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,330
>> GET OFF YOUR BUTT
AND HELP OUT AROUND HERE.

408
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,706
>> ARE YOU STILL TALKING?

409
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,291
>> YES, I AM.

410
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,376
>> YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A NEW
ATTITUDE OF ME AROUND HERE.

411
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,878
>> A NEW ATTITUDE, PHILLIP,
WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE.

412
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,587
>> COOL.

413
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,381
>> GET USE TO IT, BEAUTY QUEENS.

414
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,927
>> THANK YOU.
THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.

415
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,512
>> YOU SEE THE FIRE IS GOING,

416
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,681
WHATEVER AND YOU WON'T DO IT
UNTIL SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING.

417
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,224
>> WE ARE GOING TO WALK AWAY.

418
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,434
>> WALK AWAY AND I WILL FOLLOW
YOU IF YOU WANT ME TO.

419
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,270
>> IF YOU WANT ME TO FOLLOW YOU,
I WILL FOLLOW YOU.

420
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:10,315
>> HE IS LIKE MENTAL,
HE LITERALLY HAS A MENTAL --

421
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,068
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DIAGNOSE HIM.

422
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:16,488
>> YOU LAY AROUND THE ENTIRE DAY
IN YOUR R AND R MODE.

423
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,073
>> IT IS JUST ANNOYING.

424
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,366
I AM DONE WITH HIM, DONE.

425
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,953
>> IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
GET TOUGH.

426
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,459
>> I THINK THIS IS GOING TO END
UP SPLITTING THE TRIBE.

427
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,377
>> THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO

428
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,754
IS KEEP WINNING AND NOT GET RID

429
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,882
OF ANYONE, SO IMMEDIATELY I SAID

430
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,800
I NEED TO TAKE PHILLIP ASIDE AND

431
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,385
I NEED TO SQUASH THIS THING
RIGHT AWAY.

432
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:42,431
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T
WANT TO TAKE IT ANYMORE AND I

433
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,725
FULLY LIKE I HAVE BEEN IN THAT
POSITION AND I GET IT, I JUST

434
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,393
THINK AT THIS POINT THE MOST

435
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,436
IMPORTANT THING
HAS TO BE TEAM UNITY.

436
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,647
>> IT IS LIKE A PEACE PROCESS TO

437
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,274
BRING THE TRIBE BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN.

438
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,445
>> PHILLIP WAS RIGHT, THE GIRLS
WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING BUT THE

439
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,488
LESS THEY DO THE HAPPIER I AM.

440
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,949
I DON'T WANT THEM TO WORK HARD

441
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,492
AND, YOU KNOW, GIVING US A
REASON TO WRITE THEIR NAME DOWN

442
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,287
AND WIN A MILLION DOLLARS.

443
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,291
>> I WANT TO BORE THE HECK OUT
OF EVERYONE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

444
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,461
>> THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE IT.

445
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,171
>> GUYS.

446
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,007
>> HE IS NOT GOING TO BE
VERY HAPPY.

447
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,440
>> THE FIRST THING
ON MY TO DO LIST

448
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:38,779
OF TRYING TO GET BACK INTO
THIS TRIBE IS TO TALK TO STEVE,

449
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,866
BUT I HATE APOLOGIZING FOR STUFF
LIKE THAT, SO IT IS LIKE, OKAY.

450
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,660
SUCK IT UP.

451
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,286
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING?

452
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,330
>> HEY, I AM NOT REALLY GOOD AT
THIS, BUT I WANT TO SAY I'M

453
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,333
SORRY FOR VOTING FOR YOU.

454
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,793
I KNOW I KIND OF HURT YOUR

455
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,003
FEELINGS BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

456
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,549
>> STEPHANIE TOOK A MOMENT AND
REALLY TRIED TO EITHER PLAY THE

457
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,011
GAME A LITTLE BETTER OR TRY TO

458
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,431
WIN ME OVER OR REALLY COMING

459
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,476
FROM HER HEART, I AM NOT SURE.

460
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,811
>> I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT.

461
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,020
THANK YOU.

462
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,522
>> THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

463
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,357
>> BRINGING US TOGETHER,
YOU KNOW.

464
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,316
>> I KNOW.

465
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,485
AND IT IS GOOD TO HAVE
A POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

466
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,237
>> I KNOW SHE IS WORKING HARD,

467
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,864
SO I AM GOING TO KEEP THAT DOOR
OPEN WITH STEPHANIE.

468
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,867
I ALWAYS TRY TO BELIEVE IN
PEOPLE UNTIL THEY ABSOLUTELY,

469
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,245
YOU KNOW,
UNTIL I GET STOMPED ON.

470
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,371
>> YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
THE HONEST TRUTH?

471
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,498
>> YEAH.

472
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,541
>> THE NAME I DO WANT
TO WRITE DOWN.

473
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,961
I WANTED TO WRITE DOWN
SARITA'S NAME.

474
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,715
>> I JUST SEE HER AS THE WEAKEST
PERSON IN THE TRIBE,

475
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,593
BUT IT'S JUST THE POSITION
I AM IN--

476
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,597
IT'S LIKE I HAVE TO KEEP THAT
TO MYSELF.

477
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,599
>> I AM THINKING IT TOO.

478
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,893
YOU'RE STRONGER
IN THE CHALLENGES,

479
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,728
YOU'RE STRONGER AROUND CAMP,

480
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,063
YOU'RE STRONGER
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

481
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,773
>> STEVE AGREES WITH ME THAT

482
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,900
SARITA IS A WEAKER COMPETITOR,

483
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,444
SO I WOULD LOVE TO GO INTO A

484
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,905
CHALLENGE WHERE I COULD SHOW OFF

485
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,741
EVERYTHING I HAVE AND THEN

486
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,659
SARITA IS LACKING AND PICK UP
HER SLACK AND WIN THE CHALLENGE

487
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,371
AND EVERYONE IS REALLY HAPPY
WITH ME AND I WOULD FEEL GREAT.

488
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,749
>> ANY SINGLE THING
WOULD HELP ME AT THIS POINT.

489
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,460
I MEAN, NEED TO DRAG HER DOWN
AND BRING ME UP.

490
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,567
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

491
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,167
MIKE, WHERE IS THE ANIMOSITY

492
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,253
LEVEL RIGHT NOW BETWEEN
OMETEPE AND ZAPATERA?

493
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,964
>> I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE
CLASH GOING ON RIGHT NOW, JEFF.

494
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,967
YOU KNOW, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS COMPETITION AND BOTH

495
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,803
TRIBES DESPERATELY WANT TO WIN,

496
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,971
SO I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE
A GOOD CHALLENGE TODAY.

497
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,807
>> Jeff: PHILLIP,
ARE YOU FEELING THAT?

498
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,475
THAT THERE REALLY IS A RIVALRY?

499
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,018
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

500
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,520
>> Jeff: WHICH ANIMAL
ARE YOU USING TODAY?

501
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,562
>> BOTH.

502
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,522
>> Jeff: BOTH. BOTH?

503
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,523
>> BOTH.

504
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,690
>> Jeff: STEVE, A LITTLE

505
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,484
CONCERN HE HAS THE GORILLA
AND THE LION?

506
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,320
>> OH, FOREARM.

507
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,155
>> Jeff: YOU CATCH THAT,
PHILLIP?

508
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,156
>> I CAUGHT IT.

509
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,699
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

510
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,326
I AM READY TO GET
TO THIS CHALLENGE.

511
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,702
SHALL WE? ALL RIGHT.

512
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,622
FIRST THINGS FIRST, I WILL TAKE
BACK THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

513
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,547
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, TWO
MEMBERS OF EACH TRIBE WILL BE

514
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,050
RESPONSIBLE FOR LAUNCHING BALLS
OUT ON TO THE BEACH WHERE THE

515
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,511
REMAINING TRIBE MEMBERS
WILL CATCH THE BALLS.

516
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,805
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT COLOR A BALL IS.

517
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,183
IF YOU CATCH A BALL, YOU SCORE
A POINT FOR YOUR TRIBE.

518
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,479
FIRST TRIBE TO FIVE
WINS IMMUNITY.

519
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,982
THE LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

520
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:05,026
WHERE ONE PERSON WILL BE VOTED
OUT OF THIS GAME AND SENT TO

521
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,195
REDEMPTION ISLAND, IN ADDITION

522
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,822

NOT A LOT OF LIP SERVICE
BY STEPHANIE

639
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,360
AND NOT A LOT OF
UPTOWN GIRL LIKE SARITA.

640
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,113
IT IS GOING TO BE
A TOUGH DECISION.

641

661
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,925
>> THERE'S WATERMELON
DOWN HERE, TOO.

662
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,180

663
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,223
>> OH, EVEN BETTER.

664
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,724

665
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,352
WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS GOING
TO BE A CLUE TO THE HIDDEN

666
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,022
IMMUNITY IDOL, BECAUSE THERE IS
ALWAYS A CLUE SO RIGHT AWAY

667
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,233
I SPOT THE CLUE UNDERNEATH
THE LOBSTER TAILS

668
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,943
IN THE CENTERPIECE OF THE TABLE.

669
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,070
AT THIS POINT
THERE IS NOT ANY REASON

670
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,781
FOR ME TO DO IT, SO I REALIZE IF

671
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,574
I CAN'T GET IT WITHOUT ANYBODY

672
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,951
ELSE SEEING THAT I GOT IT, I AM

673
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,120
GOING TO LET ONE OF THEM GET IT.

674
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:35,375
SO GRANT STICKS HIS HAND UNDER
AND HE GRABS THE NOTE.

675
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,546
>> LET'S CHECK OUT THE VIEW.

676
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,799
>> THIS IS AMAZING.

677
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,053
>> LET'S LOOK AT IT
TO MAKE SURE IT IS NOT HERE.

678
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,273
SO AS GRANT IS SHOWING ME THE

679
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,816
NOTE, PHILLIP ENDS UP WALKING UP

680
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,776

AND SEES THE NOTE TOO.

681
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,737
>> THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF
LIKE, GRANT AND I AND WE GOT

682
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,489
BUSTED BY THE PRINCIPAL.

683
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,074
>> WHAT DOES IT SAY?

684
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,117

685
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,411

686
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,453

687
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,831

CAUGHT THE STEALTH, I AM THE

690
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,133
SPECIALIST, ROB IS THE MENTALIST

691
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,595

692
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:32,015
>> REMEMBER, BOYS, STEALTH.

693
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,975
AND YET TODAY, WHEN ROB AND

694
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,269
GRANT FOUND THE CLUE FOR AN IDOL

695
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,145
THEY TRIED TO HIDE IT.

696
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,149
>> WELL, HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE

697
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,528
A LION OR A GORILLA WHEN HE

698
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,615
THINKS HE HAS BEEN PROVOKED.

699
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,534
IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE AN
ALLIANCE WITH ME YOU BETTER

700
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,411
ADHERE TO IT BECAUSE I AM
ALL ABOUT INTEGRITY.

00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,372
I SERVED MY COUNTRY FOR DUTY,

702
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,666
HONOR, COUNTRY, THAT MEANS

703
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,375
SOMETHING TO ME, AND WHEN YOU

704
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,919
TRY TO TRASH ON THAT, ME AND THE

705
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,962
UNITED STATES GOT SOMETHING FOR

706
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,005
YOU WHEN YOU TRY THAT ONE, BABY.

707
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,174
I COULD DWELL ON A PLACE OF

708
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,343
NEGATIVITY RIGHT NOW BASED ON

709
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,803
WHAT I JUST SAW,
I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

710
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,348
I AM GOING TO SMILE AND WHEN THE

711
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,391
TIME COMES, I AM GOING TO KICK A

712
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,852
LITTLE ASS AROUND HERE.

713
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,542
>> AS A RESULT OF THE LOSS TODAY

714
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,044
WE ARE HEADED TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

715
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,422
TONIGHT AND IT IS GOING
TO BE INTERESTING.

716
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,551
I HAVE LOBBIED FOR STEPHANIE
TO STAY AND SARITA TO GO.

717
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,221
SARITA IS MORE LIKE A TEAM MOM
THAN A MEMBER OF THE TEAM.

718
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,722
THAT'S NOT WHO WE NEED.

719
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,890
WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO CAN

720
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,183
ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE
ON THE FIELD.

721
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,018
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT ONE,
YOU ALL.

722
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,895
>> WE JUST WEREN'T MEANT
TO WIN THAT ONE.

723
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,730
THAT WASN'T HAPPENING.

724
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,232
WE JUST GOT SMOKED.

725
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,274
>> YEAH.

726
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,740
>> IT IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT NOW.

727
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,076
THINK ABOUT THAT.

728
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,913
>> WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW IS THAT DAVID AND

729
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,207
STEPHANIE ARE DOING THEIR
DAMNEDEST TO TRY TO SWAP HER

730
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,085
NAME ON THE DOCKET WITH MY NAME.

731
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,088
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE STEPHANIE

732
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,297
LEAVE, BUT I AM NOT REALLY GOING

733
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,426
TO GO CAMPAIGNING BECAUSE I AM

734
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,635
THE MOST LOYAL PERSON THAT MY

735
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,888
TRIBE WILL EVER SEE
AND THEY ALL KNOW THAT.

736
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,064
>> MEANING WE CAN'T
SIT OUT ANY PLAYER.

737
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,607
AND THE TRUTH IS, I KNOW WHO THE

738
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,444
WEAKEST PLAYER IS PHYSICALLY
AND THAT IS SARITA.

739
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,612
>> THE GUYS LIKE YOU
MORE THAN SARITA.

740
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,156
>> IT IS A TRUST THING.

741
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,657
THEY REALLY TRUST HER.

742
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,410
>> BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS
GOING IN THE MERGE --

743
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,786
>> I KNOW.

744
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,288
>> -- YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE
WIPED OUT.

745
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,456
>> IT IS NOT A DONE DEAL YET.

746
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,957
WE HAVEN'T TALKED YET --

747
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,292
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

748
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,127
THE BEST I CAN DO IS SHOW HOW

749
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,628
COMMITTED I AM IN THESE

750
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,297
CHALLENGES AND YOU KNOW
WHAT IS IMPORTANT.

751
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,425
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP
OUR NUMBERS.

752
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,260
THEY KNOW THAT I WANT IT JUST AS

753
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,137
BAD AS THEY DO, BECAUSE I DO.

754
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,476
>> i CAN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE
EXCEPT FOR WHO I AM.

755
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,937
>> WELL, YEAH, THAT IS JUST
YOUR PERSONALITY.

756
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,898
>> STRONG WOMAN.

757
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,276
>> THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

758
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,029
>> IF THEY DON'T KEEP ME, THEY

759
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,405
ARE GOING TO LOSE EVERY SINGLE

760
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,365
CHALLENGE, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT

761
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,201
GOING TO BE ABLE
TO CARRY SARITA ANYMORE.

762
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,161
>> THEY ARE NOTICING THAT.

763
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,415
I KNOW DAVE IS ON MY SIDE.

764
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,754
>> I AM SICK OF LOSING.

765
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,380
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON NOW?

766
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,217
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING.
WINNING.

767
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,511
TRUST COMES LATER.

768
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,054
>> SORRY, GUYS.

769
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,014
>> WE KNOW WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE.

770
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,391
>> WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR
TONIGHT?

771
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,351
>> STEPHANIE IS DEFINITELY

772
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,686
STRONGER IN THE CHALLENGES,

773
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,315
SARITA, I HAVE MORE TRUST IN
SO IT GOES EITHER WAY.

774
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,442
>> I THINK THEY ARE BOTH
VERY WEAK.

775
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,654
I GIVE THEM BOTH
A ONE OUT OF TEN.

776
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,531
I JUST DISAGREE.

777
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,365
I MEAN, I'M SORRY.

778
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,034
I JUST FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE

779
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:23,704
LIKE -- ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS WINNING.

780
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,290
LIKE SERIOUSLY ALL I
CARE ABOUT IS WINNING.

781
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,259
AS WE GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, ONE

782
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,679
THING WE HAVE GOT TO WEIGH
IS IF STEPHANIE GOES HOME,

783
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,056
SARITA IS GOING TO BE
IN THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

784
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:46,394
SARITA JUST
HAS KIND OF BEEN CRUISING.

785
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,896
STEPHANIE HAS MORE FIGHT IN HER.

786
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,733
IF STEPHANIE CAN PROVE
THAT WE CAN TRUST HER,

787
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,736
I AM NOT TOTALLY OPPOSED
TO KEEPING HER AROUND.

788
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,115
IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT SET
IN STONE TONIGHT.

789
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,888
>> Jeff: DAVID, TAKE ME BACK

790
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,264
TO THE FIRST CHALLENGE
THAT YOU THREW.

791
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,434
VOLUNTARILY LOST
TO GET RID OF RUSSELL.

792
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,187
HOW BIG OF A REGRET IS STARTING
TO SETTLE IN NOW?

793
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,440
>> OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE PAYING THE
PRICE NOW FOR HAVING GIVEN THEM

794
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,276
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN TERMS
OF MOVING FORWARD IN THE GAME.

795
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,238
HAD WE KEPT OUR FOOT ON THE
THROTTLE THINGS MAY BE TOTALLY

796
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,073
DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF MOMENTUM.

797
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,450
>> Jeff: RALPH, LET'S TALK

798
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,451
ABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE, BECAUSE

799
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,621
YOU GUYS JUST GOT DESTROYED
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

800
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,291
>> I THINK WE STARTED
THE GAME OUT WRONG TODAY.

801
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,335
WE HAD NO BALLS COMING OUR WAY.

802
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,795
IF I HAD BEEN SHOOTING I BELIEVE

803
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,964
I COULD HAVE DONE
A LITTLE BETTER.

804
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,341
>> SARITA, WHY SIT YOU OUT?

805
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,803
>> I WOULD LIKED TO HAVE BEEN
OUT IN THE FIELD CATCHING.

806
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,765
>> I THOUGHT SHE WAS SHAKING IN
HER BOOTS WHEN SHE FOUND OUT WE

807
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,477
WERE GOING TO DO A CONTACT
SPORT, BUT I AM FINE WITH HER

808
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,812
SITTING OUT
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

809
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,439
SHE IS THAT GREAT
DURING CHALLENGES.

810
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,317
>> Jeff: WHEN YOU SAY YOU
THOUGHT SHE WAS QUAKING IN HER

811
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,693
BOOTS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING
PHYSICAL --

812
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,111
>> SHE WAS WORRIED SHE WAS GOING

813
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,863
TO HAVE TO GET IN THERE
AND PHYSICAL

814
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,074
AND I WAS JUST LIKE,
I DON'T CARE, LET'S DO THIS.

815
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,117
LET'S GO, YOU KNOW?

816
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,620
>> BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE
ONE THAT SAID OKAY I CAN

817
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:31,332
DEFINITELY DO IT AND END UP NOT
BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH.

818
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,168
>> Jeff: SO THEN YOU ARE
SAYING YOU WERE GLAD TO SIT OUT

819
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,795
BECAUSE THEN YOU COULDN'T
BE A GOAT?

820
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,129
>> WELL, NO.

821
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,130
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID.

822
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,967
>> I AM HEARING THE SAME THING
YOU ARE HEARING.

823
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,551
THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO PUT A
FIGHT ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN THE

824
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,345
CHALLENGE BECAUSE SHE KNEW
SHE WAS THE WORST,

825
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,556
AS A RESULT OF THAT
SHE IS NOT GOING TO BE IN

826
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,392
TROUBLE NOW BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T

827
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,185
HAVE ANY PART IN THE CHALLENGE
AND THE FAILURE.

828
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,520
>> BUT I AM NOT SAYING
I AM NOT GOOD.

829
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,521
I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE
TO BE OUT THERE.

830
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,482
>> BULL ...

831
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,568
>> I AM A BIG ACTIVE MEMBER
OF THIS TRIBE

832
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,696
AND IT IS HORRIBLE
TO WATCH THAT LOSS.

833
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,573
I MEAN, I WAS REALLY UPSET ABOUT
THE CHALLENGE AS WELL, YOU KNOW,

834
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,867
IT IS SAD TO LOSE SOMEONE,
BOTTOM LINE.

835
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,536
>> Jeff: DO YOU BUY THAT,
STEPHANIE?

836
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,579
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

837
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,624
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE COMPLAIN
AS MUCH AS SHE DOES.

838
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,211
SO FOR ME, MY IMPRESSION IS,
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE HERE.

839
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:18,879
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA --

840
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,258
>> I AM NEAR YOU
WHEN YOU LIVE --

841
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,511
>> IF THAT'S YOUR OPINION
YOU ARE FINE IF YOU THINK THAT

842
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,554
BUT YOU ARE WAY OFF BASE.

843
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,889
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

844
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,598
>> WELL, THAT'S FINE
BUT YOU ARE.

845
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,560
>> OKAY.

846
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,687
>> Jeff: STEVE, IS THERE ANY

847
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,564
PART OF YOU THAT WONDERS, MAYBE

848
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,734
STEPHANIE'S SPUNK ALONE IS WORTH

849
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,360
KEEPING HER AROUND?

850
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,862
>> ON THE PRO SIDE
FOR STEPHANIE,

851
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,281
SHE IS A WARRIOR AT HEART.

852
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,950
SHE WORKS HARD
AROUND THE CAMPSITE.

853
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:52,580
SARITA, ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,
IS A TRUSTWORTHY CONFIDANT.

854
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,416
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER DO
MORE AROUND THE CAMPSITE

855
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,879
AND SEE HER PICK UP
THE CHALLENGE AS WELL.

856
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,257
YOU KNOW, SHE IS A BIT OF AN
UPTOWN GIRL THAT I DON'T THINK

857
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,551
HAS GOTTEN HER FOOTING OUT HERE
IN THE WILDERNESS YET.

858
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,387
>> Jeff: SOUNDS LIKE TWO OF
THE POSITIVES ARE ACTUALLY

859
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,765
NEGATIVES THERE BUT THAT COULD
HAVE BEEN JUST MY PERCEPTION.

860
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,683
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, JEFF,

861
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,436
THE TRIBE IS TOO OBSESSED WITH
TRUSTING ONE ANOTHER AT A TIME

862
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,438
WHEN TRUST IS NOT THE MOST
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

863
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,733
THE STAGE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW
FOCUSES ON PUTTING THE BEST SIX

864
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,568
OUT IN THE FIELD TO DO WHAT WE
NEED TO DO TO WIN, TRUST WILL

865
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,072
COME WITH TIME, RIGHT NOW WE
NEED TO FOCUS ON WINNING.

866
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,241
>> Jeff: RALPH WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THAT STRATEGIC LAYOUT?

867
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,118
>> SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

868
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,580
SOUNDS REAL GOOD.

869
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,665
>> Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S
VOTE IS CLEARLY A BIG VOTE.

870
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,668
WHICH DIRECTION
IS THIS TRIBE GOING TO GO?

871
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,796
LET'S FIND OUT.

872
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,005
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

873
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,466
RALPH, YOU ARE UP.

874
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,975
>> MAYBE IF YOU SPENT
MORE TIME THINKING

875
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,478
ABOUT YOUR ACTIONS AND HOW YOU
FIT IN WITH YOUR TRIBE,

876
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,730
YOU WOULD STILL BE AROUND.

877
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,997
>> I WILL SEE YOU
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

878
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,541
I WILL KICK YOUR ASS THEN.

879
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,676
>> I MADE THE BEST ARGUMENTS
FOR YOU, STEPHANIE,

880
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,387
HOPEFULLY THIS WORKS.

881
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,476
>> Jeff: I WILL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

882
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,986
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL,

883
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,654
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE

884
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,406
TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

885
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,366
I WILL READ THE VOTES.

886
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,662
FIRST VOTE, SARITA.

887
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,667
STEPHANIE, ONE VOTE,
ONE VOTE SARITA.

888
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,797
>> SARITA, TWO VOTES SARITA.

889
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,218
STEPHANIE, THAT'S TWO VOTES

890
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,512
STEPHANIE, TWO VOTES FOR SARITA.

891
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,349
STEPHANIE, THREE VOTES

892
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,643
STEPHANIE, TWO VOTES SARITA.

893
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,731
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

894
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,608
SURVIVOR REDEMPTION ISLAND,
STEPHANIE.

895
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,026
THAT'S FOUR, THAT IS ENOUGH.

896
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,153
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

897
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,743
STEPHANIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

898
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,124
BUT YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET BACK IN THIS GAME.

899
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,793
GRAB YOUR TORCH.
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

900
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,096
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU MADE THE
DECISION TO GO WITH SOMEBODY

901
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,098
YOU THINK YOU CAN TRUST
VERSUS KEEPING SOMEBODY

902
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,309
THAT MIGHT HAVE DONE
BETTER AT CHALLENGES.

903
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,727
WE WILL KNOW SOON ENOUGH
IF YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL.

904
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,438
GRAB YOUR TORCHES
AND HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

905
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:06,482
GOOD NIGHT.

906
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,870
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

907
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,793
NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR.

908
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,128
>> ONE OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT ASPECTS

909
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,464
OF THE GAME OF SURVIVOR
IS MENTAL FATIGUE.

910
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:31,715
>> I AM LOSING MY MIND.

911
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,843
>> DAVE IS BUGGING ME.

912
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,303
HE'S A LOOSE CANNON.

913
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,973
>> CRAZY, CRAZY, CRAZY.

914
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,183
>> ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB.

915
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,143
>> IF WE LOSE,
THE TARGET IS ON ME.

916
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,228
>> WOW.

917
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,487
MY STRATEGY OUT HERE IS TO BE

918
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,823
BRUTALLY HONEST
ABOUT ZAPATERA TRIBE.

919
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,200
>> NO WAY.

920
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,660
YOU DON'T WANT TO ALIGN
WITH MY PEOPLE.

921
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,287
>> I DON'T THINK I DO.

922
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,998
>> THEY ARE NOT NICE PEOPLE,
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT.

923
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,791
>> WHEN I WIN, I AM NOT
GOING BACK TO THEM.

924
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:09,253
THAT IS OBVIOUS.
