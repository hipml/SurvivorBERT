00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,252
- (Jeff Probst)
Previously on<i> Survivor...</i>

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,672
All bets were off when the game
took a drastic twist.

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,258
Silas, Teresa, Frank, you
guys are now members of Boran.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,428
Kelly, Lex, Tom, you guys are
now members of Samburu.

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,470
- No, what?

6
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,013
- (Probst)
At Samburu, Lindsey,

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,766
Brandon and Kim were shocked to
meet their new tribe mates.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,767
- I'm just, like...

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,144
- (Probst)
At Boran, Ethan, Kim

10
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,354
and Clarence had the same
surprise.

11
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,731
- Hey, you got
a nice holster.

12
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,441
- I'm definitely on the other
side right now.

13
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,734
I was on the good side,
now I'm on the bad side.

14
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,194
- Frank and I looked at each
other and thought, "You know..."

15
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,863
- We're alive again.

16
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,282
- (Probst) Boran won three
egg-laying chickens

17
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,951
and a rooster
at the reward challenge.

18
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:35,994
Boran wins!

19
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,203
- Boran!

20
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,164
- (Probst) But Samburu won
the immunity challenge...

21
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,666
(cheering)

22
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,126
...sending Boran
to Tribal Council,

23
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,629
where Silas was voted
out of the tribe.

24
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,465
Well, there's been
a lot of assumptions made by you

25
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,508
guys so far in this game.

26
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,095
One of them is that in three
days there will be a merge.

27
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,638
11 are left.

28
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,182
Tonight,
one more will go.

29
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,437
♪♪

30
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,454
♪♪

31
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:13,383
(clucking)

32
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,556
- You know, during our
questioning, Jeff's, like,

33
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,599
"Ethan, with this
merger coming up,

34
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,560
are you vulnerable getting
voted off?"

35
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,228
So the merger is coming up.

36
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,438
- My gut feeling would be, if
the merger was changed from the

37
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,234
norm, that it would be sooner
rather than later.

38
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,610
- Well,
I think either way,

39
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,571
beginning tomorrow morning we're
just going to have to be ready

40
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,655
for whatever comes.

41
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,865
- Right.

42
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,534
- The whole thing with the
merge is driving me insane.

43
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,953
At the end of Tribal Council the
other night, Jeff said,

44
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:46,082
"You guys assume
the merge is in three days."

45
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,750
So, you know, he throws
the question out there.

46
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
He throws
the thought out there.

47
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,462
Put it in our head that, like,
oh, my God, maybe the merge

48
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,923
<i>isn't</i> in three days.

49
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,259
We rationed our food so we're
ending all our food at

50
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,844
the merger,
which is in three days.

51
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,096
If we eat all our food and
there's no merger after three

52
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,015
days, we have no food.

53
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,933
- We have three chickens.

54
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,435
- We need to decide,
do we stay

55
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,438
with our normal
food intake, do we ration?

56
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,440
I mean, how do you guys
want to proceed?

57
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,108
- We prepa- Yeah.the worst.

58
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,735
- I mean, what happens
if it's in ten days?

59
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,944
We're screwed.

60
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,502
(crickets chirping)

61
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,171
- I got another hour
before daylight.

62
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,923
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,140
- (whispers) We got, like,
five-hour watch.

64
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,477
I think we came out
about 1:00 in the morning.

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,146
Tom and I took in a long night
shift last night.

66
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,857
Everyone else took about an hour
and a half, two hours, and we

67
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,484
got, like... we got stuck with
about five hours.

68
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,486
We've been staying up all night
for over two weeks.

69
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,990
These guys have no concept
of what a three-hour shift is.

70
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,492
They just throw a log on
the fire and go to bed.

71
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,494
- That sucks.

72
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,828
- I know, it's terrible,

73
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,414
but she just does
not want to do it at all.

74
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,250
- I think Lindsey's heart is in
the right place.

75
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,919
- Oh, yeah,
she's a sweet girl.

76
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,005
- She's just a big...

77
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,841
- It was painfully obvious the
moment we stepped foot in camp

78
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,177
here that, you know, we had
three people here that...

79
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,846
they were here for
a little resort vacation.

80
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,764
They weren't here
to do anything

81
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,934
but nap and eat
and make a couple meals.

82
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,269
- How was your guys'
last shift?

83
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,853
Was it
too long, too short?

84
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,896
- It was at least
five hours.

85
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,772
- Was it, really?

86
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,360
Everyone is
stressed out right now.

87
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,903
This whole switcheroo
thing has made

88
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,905
everyone's mind
kind of go crazy.

89
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,615
Everyone is thinking, "Oh, we're
two new tribes now.

90
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,783
Let's not think
of our old tribes."

91
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,909
But it's inevitable,

92
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:45,952
you're going to think of
your old tribe.

93
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,538
- I want to know who the hell
got the boot.

94
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,706
- Frank is a target.

95
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,167
- I think everyone
will vote for him.

96
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,585
- I hope so.

97
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,213
- People just want to see
what's shaking up at Boran,

98
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,382
because what goes on over there
could totally affect

99
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,050
what happens over here.

100
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,385
- What do you think?

101
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,554
- I'm concerned that Kim may
have gotten canned.

102
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,725
- We know if we get beat in a
challenge, we've got our vote,

103
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,394
and we know it's going to be
three-three.

104
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,645
They're going to pick out
somebody on us, and we're going

105
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,732
to pick out somebody
on them.

106
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:20,111
But the key to the vote
is what's happened before.

107
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,238
- If we have to go to
Tribal Council,

108
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,531
it's all
about past votes.

109
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,577
If we have a tie, it comes down
to who has more votes, then I

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,247
already have four votes
against me, so I'd be gone.

111
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,207
- Three more nights y'all have
got with us.

112
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,334
- God, I'm glad
we got you guys.

113
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,460
- Yeah, we lucked out,
we did really, really well.

114
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,588
- I'm really trying to save my
own butt, you know?

115
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,591
I don't want them to have any
clue about my situation.

116
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,761
I mean, I set a goal for myself,
and I am the kind of person that

117
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,221
when I set a goal,
I'm going to achieve it.

118
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,947
- I can't stop
thinking about food.

119
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,324
I dream about food.

120
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,825
I think about food when I'm
eating food.

121
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,037
I think about food 24/7.

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,164
Any - No.yet?

123
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,541
- Ah, you know what that
means-- chopping-block day.

124
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,960
- Since we got those
chickens,

125
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,003
we'll have to
keep an eye on you.

126
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,130
Every time you walk
by the cage,

127
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,173
we'll have to
keep an eye on you.

128
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,299
- I will not deny that I'm

129
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,885
having homicidal feelings about
those damn chickens.

130
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,053
- What do
you guys think?

131
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,555
What do you and Kim think about
the chicken situation?

132
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,681
- I don't know.

133
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,683
I mean, you just
want to eat them?

134
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,228
- I'- Yeah, me, too.gs.

135
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,147
- For some reason I don't know
that that's going to happen.

136
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,148
- Yeah.

137
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,566
Some people want to eat
the chickens right away,

138
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,570
like Clarence,
and some people want to wait

139
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,322
to see if they'll lay
some eggs.

140
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,491
It's just, the problem is, if we
go to the merger and we're not

141
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,618
allowed to take the chickens,
then it's a waste.

142
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,621
- Chicken nuggets.

143
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,374
- Clarence, are they acting
like they're thinking about

144
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:56,833
laying eggs?

145
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,919
- Hell, no.

146
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,838
I'm breaking straw for your
little asses.

147
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,215
Lay some eggs.

148
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,176
- The chickens are presently
still up for debate, but we're

149
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,512
going to wait till today's
reward challenge to see

150
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,180
what's available
today and then probably

151
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,473
make a decision
tonight.

152
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,857
- Whatever it is,
I hope there's no animals.

153
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,859
No goats, chickens.

154
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,569
The only animal I want is
something that's going to be on

155
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,864
a plate, that I could eat.

156
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,365
That's all I want,
just food.

157
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,951
- Good old food.

158
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,870
- Yep, there is mail.

159
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,580
You ready?

160
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,291
- Yeah.

161
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,625
- "Stick with your tribe.

162
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,586
"Make your
way to the bottom.

163
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,548
"Just give us your answers,
that is, if you got 'em.

164
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,217
"You must work as
a team, confer with your bunch.

165
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,802
Make a wrong move and watch
the others eat lunch."

166
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,138
- Oh, that's good.

167
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,224
- The reward they said is
"lunch," so the food-- maybe,

168
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,100
we'll go someplace,
and have a

169
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,061
nice sit-down
lunch-slash-dinner.

170
00:07:59,145 --> 00:07:59,729
- "Make your way to
the bottom."

171
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,731
That's the clue in there.

172
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,567
- Maybe it's, like, a giant
board game or something.

173
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,819
- How comfortable are you guys
with all the stuff in the book?

174
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,070
Pretty good with
all that?

175
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,488
Today's tree mail indicates

176
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,116
that it's probably something
sort of cerebral.

177
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,118
We've been studying
all the things we learned in our

178
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,828
survival manual-- the desert out
here, and the plants and

179
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,999
the animals-- hoping that
we can win us a free lunch.

180
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,509
- Silas is gone,
Silas is gone.

181
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,682
Oh, my God.

182
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,767
- (Probst)
Hey, guys.

183
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,768
Samburu, getting
your first look

184
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,646
at the latest member of Boran
to be voted out.

185
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,689
Silas is gone.

186
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,941
Reactions? Surprised?

187
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,650
-- No.h.

188
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,985
- No... no.

189
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,530
- All right, today for
your reward challenge, I'm going

190
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,576
to ask you a series of questions
about Africa, and you'll answer

191
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
each question as a tribe.

192
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,373
Each time you get one right,
you move one step down on

193
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,416
the bleacher, one step
closer to the finish.

194
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,878
First tribe to reach the finish
gets the reward.

195
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,672
Want to know what
you're playing for?

196
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,465
- Yes, sir.

197
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,883
- Oh...

198
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,802
- Oh, my God.

199
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,844
(excited shouts)

200
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,972
- (braying)

201
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,139
- It's cold, too.

202
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,683
- Oh...

203
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,644
- (Probst) Just to
whet your whistle,

204
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,355
I'm going to give you
guys a little taste.

205
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,692
Tell me that's not going to
taste good, huh, Clarence?

206
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,860
(chuckling)

207
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,655
- Ah, it's so good.

208
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,656
- Yeah!

209
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,490
- (Probst) Okay,
the Mountain Dew

210
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,200
is just a little bit
of a tease.

211
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,827
Here's the rest of what you're
playing for.

212
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,912
Got a nice little
buffet set out for you here.

213
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,373
- - Wow.d.

214
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,666
- Oh, my God.

215
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,835
- (Probst) Fresh pasta
with vegetables.

216
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,255
We got a huge
tray of sandwiches.

217
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,007
And a big old plate of
cookies...

218
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,508
- Oh-ho-ho!

219
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,592
- (Probst)
...for dessert.

220
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,262
Not to mention, all the Mountain
Dew you can drink.

221
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,180
- O- Oh...!d!

222
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,349
- (Probst) How good is that
going to taste for somebody?

223
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,977
All right, Samburu, 'cause you
have one extra person,

224
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,604
you've chosen
Tom to sit out.

225
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,690
Guys, head to the top
of the bleachers.

226
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,107
Wait for my start.

227
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,361
Here we go.

228
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,696
First question.

229
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,115
True or false?

230
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,660
"The closest ocean
to Kenya is the Atlantic."

231
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,542
Okay, show me
your answer.

232
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,044
Boran says "false."

233
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,295
Samburu says "false."

234
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,713
You're both right.

235
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,048
Indian Ocean,
closest ocean.

236
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,966
Move down a level.

237
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,885
True or false?

238
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,972
"To save the elephant population
in Kenya, military rangers are

239
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,977
instructed to
shoot to kill ivory poachers."

240
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,896
True or false?

241
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,272
(inaudible whispering)

242
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,607
Let's reveal.

243
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,149
"True," says Samburu.

244
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:50,858
Boran says "true."

245
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,904
You're both right.

246
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,739
Next question.

247
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:02,578
"On safari, the animals known as
the 'Big Five' are the elephant,

248
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:08,584
rhino, lion, buffalo,
and what other animal?"

00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,421

(inaudible whispering)

252
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:20,846
- (whispers)
I know this, I know this.

253
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,641
- (Probst) Reveal.

254
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,644
A, says Samburu,
"leopard."

255
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,978
D, says Boran. "Hippo."

256
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,273
Correct answer,
A) leopard.

257
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,025
Samburu moves
one step closer.

258
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,110
- I'm sorry, guys.

259
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,444
- (Probst) Next question.

260
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,115
"Diurnal is a term
to describe what?"

261
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:44,328
A) Animals that must eat plants
as well as meat to stay healthy,

262
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,289
B) Animals that
hunt in groups,

263
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,043
C) animals that are more
prevalent by day,

264
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,464
or D) Animals that do not eat
humans but pose a threat through

265
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,342
the diseases
they may carry.

266
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,052
Diurnal.

267
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,639
(inaudible whispering)

268
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,599
Let's reveal.

269
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,519
Samburu says
C) More prevalent by day.

270
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,061
Boran says C.

271
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,896
You're both right.

272
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,981
You guys need to stand.

273
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,192
Samburu is now
at their last step.

274
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,485
One more correct answer,

275
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,656
you guys are having
a nice, big old fat lunch.

276
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,157
Here we go.

277
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,826
True or false?

278
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,414
"Kenya's Lake Victoria is the
world's largest saltwater lake."

279
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,338
(inaudible whispering)

280
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,007
All right, Samburu.

281
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,008
Reveal.

282
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,052
Samburu says "false."

283
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,679
Boran
says "false."

284
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,016
It is actually not the largest,
and it is freshwater.

285
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,100
Bon appétit, Samburu.

286
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,185
(cheering, whooping)

287
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,853
- Yeah!

288
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,230
- Oh, my God!

289
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,190
- Oh, my God!

290
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,859
- (Probst) Samburu,
your food's waiting.

291
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,443
- I'm, like, all nervous.

292
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,403
Like it's a first date.

293
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,363
I'm, like, is the food
going to reject me?

294
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,531
- Oh, God.

295
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,742
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
chocolate!

296
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,201
- Mayonnaise. Mustard.

297
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,035
- Oh, my Gosh.

298
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,954
Oh, look at
this sandwich.

299
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,039
- Oh, my God,
an ice cube.

300
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,081
- Tell me what you want.

301
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,458
- Shortbread.

302
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,126
- This is the best cheese
sandwich I've ever had.

303
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,713
- I swear to God, it's the best
thing I've ever tasted.

304
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,715
- Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

305
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,884
- It's just like a picnic.

306
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,636
- Hey, we're breaking bread
together... great.

307
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,053
- Proper, we're
breaking bread proper.

308
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,054
- Proper.

309
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,890
- - Bon appétit.s.

310
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,141
- Have a nice weekend.

311
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,559
- Oh, my God.

312
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,602
- It has been
a real pleasure.

313
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,686
- Our new team.

314
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,729
(cheering, whooping)

315
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,981
- Remember the Dew!

316
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,107
(man belches)

317
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,193
- Oh, that was a good one.

318
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,956
- Oh, my God.

319
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,957
- You'll be okay,
just go slow.

320
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,083
- I am sweating.

321
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,709
My heart is racing.

322
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,087
My stomach hurts like I have
never felt before in my life.

323
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,424
- The food reward was amazing,
I mean, we just pigged out.

324
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,510
And our stomachs, you know,
they've shrunk,

325
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,096
so it's-- it's
hard to stuff food in there and

326
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,973
let them expand, but we sure
found a way.

327
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,099
- Just take it real slow
and easy, then.

328
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,768
- Oh, my God.

329
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,689
- Better to hold
this down if you can.

330
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,858
- Kim gorged on stuff her body
wasn't used to, and her tiny

331
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,027
little, you know,
five foot one figure

332
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,154
isn't going to hold all
that very well.

333
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,323
So she was
pretty close to vomiting.

334
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,616
- (groans)

335
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,617
- Just stick your finger
down your throat.

336
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,453
- No, no, no,
just let her take her time.

337
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,164
Let her take her time.

338
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,249
- Look at her belly!

339
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,460
(laughter)

340
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,713
- It is pooching out.

341
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,548
- Oh, do- It's okay. laugh.

342
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,967
- You're going to be a vomit
launch extravaganza.

343
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,635
- Kim, if you barf,
just barf a little bit of it out

344
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,137
and then keep the rest.

345
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,388
- Oh, my God.

346
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,264
- Luckily, we were all
able to hold it down.

347
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,265
We were all
very proud of ourselves.

348
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,392
And having all this energy

349
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,978
stored up should definitely give
us an edge, I hope.

350
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:56,604
- Oh, I feel good.

351
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,397
- That felt really good.

352
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,273
- (groans)

353
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,692
- The weather today has been
awesome.

354
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,069
We got a full meal,
and we got rid of Silas.

355
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,156
- Oh, he's probably
just fuming!

356
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,868
When I saw that
Silas was gone, my heart sank.

357
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,244
I was definitely shocked.

358
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,455
- I never would have guessed he
had votes against him, and you

359
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,456
would think it would come down
three and three.

360
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,499
- You know why
Silas has votes against him?

361
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,709
'cause Frank tried to get Silas
in an alliance

362
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,711
and - Really.d no.

363
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,087
- So Frank went ballistic.

364
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,255
- That is bizarre.

365
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,506
- Yeah. It was awful.

366
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,050
It was a total showdown.

367
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,678
When we had the upper hand, we
treated Frank and Teresa poorly.

368
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,264
Especially me, I gloated, and
I was excited and I felt like

369
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:37,019
I was the queen of the land,
which was a bad move on my part.

370
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,312
And I think they were definitely
out for some kind of revenge.

371
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,939
- Frank must have totally sold
out Silas, 'cause there's no way

372
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,232
they would have known
to vote for him.

373
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,734
- Oh, yeah, that's exac--
that's what I mean.

374
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,110
- What a little pig.

375
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,072
- I told Lindsey that probably
was a big part of them switching

376
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,033
to Silas, you know, because
y'all got in their face, and you

377
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,952
have to really think about it,
if they're backed into a corner.

378
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,538
Looks to me like we're the ones
kind of over the pit now.

379
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,799
- I think for
the rest of my life,

380
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,467
I want to be a food
critic.

381
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,053
I'm going to be called
the "man's man's food critic."

382
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:11,970
You know what I'm saying?

383
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,555
The "meat-and-potatoes
food critic."

384
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,724
When people see me coming,
they better be on their game.

385
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,393
Your French fries better be
extra greasy.

386
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,228
Your pancakes
better be extra fluffy.

387
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,729
- Let the rest of them fools

388
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,190
critique all those fancy French
sushi places.

389
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,610
- Clarence, if anyone,
is probably having the most

390
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,278
difficult time controlling
wanting to get his fingers on

391
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,989
some fried chicken, more or
less, you know.

392
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,951
Which I don't blame him, but
it's no way to play the game and

393
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,079
for down the road, for a
valuable resource, so...

394
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,330
Hey, we'll still all get an
egg, maybe.

395
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,959
We'll get an egg
or two, hopefully.

396
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,293
- The members of my tribe,
they're of the opinion that

397
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,214
given the right environment, our
chickens are going to lay eggs,

398
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:51,385
which is completely...
a joke to me.

399
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,431
(chickens clucking)

400
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,350
- Believe it or not, I think
we're all unsure what the hens

401
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,893
need to do to lay
the eggs.

402
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,728
Frank wants to
put a net out there

403
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,314
so they can run around
and play.

404
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,315
(quiet laugh)

405
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,447
- Oh, giving
you something nice.

406
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,281
I think that's better for them,
don't you?

407
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,159
- One of you say
your good-byes.

408
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,994
Don't get mad.
Don't get mad, man.

409
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,120
- Oh, she's telling you.

410
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:18,912
- Don't get mad.

411
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,582
Tribal Council
for you tonight.

412
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,958
- As much as we're
joking about it,

413
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,002
I am serious about killing
one of those chickens.

414
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,712
(knife scraping)

415
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,342
You know, I've talked to each
one of the chickens personally,

416
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:36,138
and I've informed them that,
you know, they're on notice.

417
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,307
- Last night you told them you
loved them and...

418
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,477
- I do, man. I also told them,
you know, you got 24 hours to

419
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,311
lay an egg,
and now technically,

420
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,814
it'll be 48 hours, so that's
on them.

421
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,067
- What if they lay an egg by
tomorrow morning?

422
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,318
- Then we spare them.
How's that?

423
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,319
- I swear.

424
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,653
- You hear that,
you guys?

425
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,572
Clarence says if
we find an egg in the morning,

426
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,491
the chicken lives.

427
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,535
- All they have to do
is lay an egg, one egg.

428
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:11,256
- I mean, we don't know what's
happened over there.

429
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,382
I mean, we have no idea,
like, they have no idea that all

430
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,802
of us are over here totally
getting along.

431
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,385
- Yeah, that's true.

432
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,428
- I'm kind of loving it.

433
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,015
I kind of think it's cool.

434
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,142
- I've had some moments with
Kelly that I feel like we've

435
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,062
sort of bonded and we've had a
good time, and she has expressed

436
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,439
that she's fearful of her
demise, so...

437
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,400
She seems pretty genuine.

438
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,028
- (whispers)
I think Kelly really likes her.

439
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,072
- I think they really like
all three of us.

440
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,366
But that has
nothing to do with it.

441
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,576
We cannot vote for Lindsey.

442
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,704
If she gets voted against, I'm
gone in the next six days.

443
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,124
And that's
the same with you.

444
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,084
And that's not
good enough.

445
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,545
- If we have to go to a Tribal
Council, we're assuming that it

446
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,213
will go to a tiebreaker and

447
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,631
they'll ask us questions from
this handbook.

448
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,549
- Which is what
they did the last time.

449
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,884
- Which is what they did
the last time.

450
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,719
- But, see, you're not, I mean,
you don't see the big picture.

451
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,389
They are not... they are not
going to vote for you.

452
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,308
They like you more than me,
'cause I have haven't been

453
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,727
trying to be
all that extra nice to them.

454
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,145
I just haven't.

455
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,397
I mean, I don't care.

456
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,361
(rooster crowing)

457
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,617
(chickens clucking)

458
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,419
- Good morning,
boys and girls.

459
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,337
Did you guys
leave us any eggs?

460
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,506
(chickens clucking)

461
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,259
I went into the cage this
morning, and I didn't see

462
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,595
anything in the beginning at
all, and I thought, "Oh, damn,

463
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,432
these chickens didn't lay
any eggs again."

464
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,439
(quietly)
Yay. Look at this.

465
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,025
Look at this,
you guys. Yay.

466
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,818
Yes, yes.

467
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,444
Yes, we have eggs.

468
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,362
- Oh, don't tell...

469
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,447
She's got
something in her hand.

470
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,531
- (whistling a tune)

471
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,659
- I'll be damned.

472
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,202
Look at that, see?

473
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,831
You've got an egg,
right?

474
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,042
Oh, yeah!

475
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,084
Great.

476
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:11,793
- Isn't that cool?

477
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,921
Let's just put it right there.

478
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,548
- Just let it sit there.

479
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,134
- So we're just going to keep
it right on the tray there until

480
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,303
Clarence wakes up
and sees the egg.

481
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,638
(imitates Clarence)
Oh, damn!

482
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,473
Damn, those chickens.

483
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,016
We finally
have an egg.

484
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,144
- I loved it this morning when
Kim brought over that egg.

485
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:31,855
'cause last night Clarence was,
like, "Well, one of them have an

486
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,565
egg, we don't have to
eat the chicken."

487
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:37,527
- An egg!

488
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,573
- Shh.

489
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,574
- (whispers) Wow!

490
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,994
- Shh. He's coming.

491
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,500
- What's up?

492
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,545
- What's up,
Clarence?

493
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,756
- Aw, hell, no!
Come on!

494
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,508
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

495
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,844
(whooping, cheering)

496
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,595
- No chicken for you!

497
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,099
- I hate you
and you and you

498
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,560
and you, and you did it just to
spite me, so whatever.

499
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,479
And you laid... and they laid
the smallest egg possible, too.

500
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,232
(laughter)

501
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,401
If you scramble that egg,
it might disappear.

502
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,778
(laughter)

503
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,363
Oh, I hate those
chickens.

504
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,322
- Truth is,
I don't think any

505
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,116
of us mind killing a chicken
for dinner.

506
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,703
- We tormented him a little
bit, but we decided we were

507
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,870
going to kill a chicken and eat
it for dinner anyway.

508
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,798
- You can come to my house

509
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,050
and carve a Thanksgiving
turkey anytime.

510
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,427
- Mmm.

511
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,554
- Oh, my God.

512
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,431
The chicken tastes great.

513
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,726
Everyone had a hand in preparing
it, and, I mean, I was just,

514
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,644
wow, it was just... mwah!

515
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,896
- Oh.

516
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,398
(chuckling)

517
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:56,898
- Oh, God.

518
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,942
- Oka- Wow.l...

519
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,985
- How good is that?

520
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,153
- Mmm.

521
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:05,407
- Since our arrival, Teresa and
I, we've been smiling.

522
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,284
It's been a very
comfortable transition.

523
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,076
Thank you, everyone.

524
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,494
You know,
I wish we would have

525
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,246
been here from day one with
these people.

526
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,664
- Y'all, that was
very delicious.

527
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,627
♪♪

528
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,520
- (whispering)
That makes sense.

529
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,606
I can't believe I never thought
of that, why Kim was doing it.

530
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,776
- No, I didn't know she was
doing this.

531
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,277
- She did it at the...

532
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,904
- All I saw her do
is this.

533
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:44,696
- She did
that yesterday, too.

534
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,490
- I'm such an idiot.

535
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,700
All this time, Kim, at the
challenges, she was doing this.

536
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,952
I'm, like, what does
this mean, lose?

537
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,621
Do you want me
to throw the challenge?

538
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,289
What's the L? The L?

539
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,042
Then I'm sitting there, and I'm,
like, "Oh, Lindsey."

540
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,627
Obviously, she thinks
Lindsey has votes against her.

541
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,297
And also I think she was trying
to tell me Brandon.

542
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,007
Because if she was doing
something like this, I don't

543
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:04,925
know, I think it's "B"
in sign language.

544
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,968
She knows sign language.
I don't know it.

545
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,804
- They were totally
communicating,

546
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,348
and I was like...
"What's going on?"

547
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:15,185
And she kept going...

548
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,853
- They were trying to
tell them something.

549
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,815
I don't know if it was, you
know, vote for Lindsey,

550
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,484
she has votes, or...
I don't know.

551
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,160
- I... I think
we need to go

552
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,079
with the safest bet,
as we've said all along.

553
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,164
- I mean, we're playing
hard ball now.

554
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,666
- Yeah, that's true.

555
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,626
- We're pretty sure that

556
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,545
Brandon already has votes
against him.

557
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,380
We suspected that
from the start.

558
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,507
Knowing that Frank had been
in the same tribe with him,

559
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,926
we figured if there was anybody
that Frank was just going to

560
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,969
throw a vote at just on

561
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,805
principal alone, it would have
been Brandon.

562
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,519
- I don't know what they're
thinking, but I don't have any

563
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,646
votes, so I still think I have
a really good chance.

564
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,691
But if they vote for Lindsey,
then it's done, she's gone.

565
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,944
Out of the three of us, they're
gonna be most likely to think

566
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,196
that I have a vote from Frank,
you know what I mean?

567
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,240
- That's why they think they're
sitting pretty, it's because

568
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,366
they assume
that you have a vote.

569
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,034
- They just assume that I have
a vote from Frank.

570
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,703
- Should we just vote
for Tom and stick to it?

571
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,787
- We stick with it.

572
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,124
That's it, period.

573
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,043
- (loud snoring)

574
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,379
- We're totally confident that
if it's a three-and-three tie

575
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,715
against Brandon and Tom, that
Brandon can win the questions.

576
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,386
- (groaning)

577
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,847
- I mean, Kelly, she's like
a walking thesaurus, and Lex

578
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,766
probably is too much
of a chance, too.

579
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,936
So we think we're going to vote
for Tom, knowing that Brandon

580
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,104
could probably
beat him in trivia.

581
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,732
- I'm going to do it,
there's just no way around it.

582
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,276
There's no way I can lose to
him, unless it's...

583
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,903
I can't imagine what question
they would ask that he would

584
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,446
know and I wouldn't.

585
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,655
I mean, I told the girls this
is what we would do.

586
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,741
I'll have to just
take a bullet for her.

587
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,619
Let's have a group hug.

588
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,038
Come here.

589
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,920
- It looks like they're still
a little divided, so it probably

590
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,796
will be a three-three vote on
their side.

591
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,298
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

592
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,634
- And hopefully they got
the clue that Lindsey has four

593
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,928
votes, and they'll vote her.

594
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,305
- Yeah.

595
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,895
- Oh, yes!

596
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:26,775
- (both) "To bring home
the bounty, the key is to aim.

597
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,654
"If you can't hit the mark,
there's no one to blame.

598
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,991
"It may seem
so easy, but lest ye confuse,

599
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,827
the last tribe to do it
will pick one to lose."

600
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,870
- So everyone's
got to do it.

601
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,622
- Yep.

602
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,958
- So Frank can teach us all
how to do it, which is good.

603
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,626
- Oh, that's right,
he's a hunter.

604
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,629
- You know, immediately they
read the mail, and it was going

605
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,297
to take a team effort
by all of us.

606
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,717
So being what I consider
proficient somewhat in archery,

607
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,804
I was immediately thrust right
into the limelight.

608
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,306
Okay, T, here's
the line, right here.

609
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,058
Point your left foot
right at the target.

610
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,142
Got it?

611
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,769
Index finger on top,
let it seep.

612
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:07,482
Lean a little forward, draw
back, and hold that form until

613
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,068
the arrow hits the ground.

614
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,152
Okay.

615
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,570
That's a start.

616
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,405
- Frank, I'm starting
to figure

617
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,532
out about Frank
is he's a teacher.

618
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,742
He loves instruction.

619
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,120
You know, I think that probably
comes from a little bit, mostly

620
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,871
from the military,
in terms of giving orders.

621
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,999
- Now, wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

622
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,667
Are you plan- No.on shooting?

623
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,836
- Oh, okay, because you are
loaded right now.

624
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,046
It's like having
a gun right now in your hand.

625
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,923
- Frank, definitely, I mean,
this is Frank's thing.

626
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:37,012
He's very, you know, vocal and
giving us all the help he can.

627
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,347
- Okay.
It's a timing issue.

628
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,765
- Without him, you know,
I wouldn't know all the little

629
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,852
stuff that could bring us
the win later on.

630
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,188
- Very good,
straight arrow.

631
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,732
See how nice and straight
that went?

632
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,067
- (whoops)
Beautiful!

633
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,694
- That's very nice,
nicely done.

634
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,945
- This immunity challenge is
important, because right now,

635
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:59,868
although on paper the old Boran
tribe has a one-person edge,

636
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,538
you still don't
know what's going on.

637
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,041
- Yes.

638
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,390
- (Probst)
First things first.

639
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,935
Lindsey, got to take back
immunity idol.

640
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,438
Immunity is
back up for grabs.

641
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,107
As you can see, we have some
fires, nice and smoky, burning.

642
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,735
Those will come into play for
today's immunity challenge.

643
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,486
We're going to test your

644
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,988
proficiency with
a bow and arrow.

645
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:41,159
Each tribe has five targets,
ranging from 30 to 70 feet.

646
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,828
You'll square off against each
other, one member from each

647
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,332
tribe taking one shot,
then the next pair will go.

648
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:51,002
First tribe using lighted arrows
to light up all five targets

649
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,796
wins immunity,
avoids the vote.

650
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,924
Pick your first shooter
and wait for my go.

651
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,967
Samburu, because you have one
extra member, you've chosen

652
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,096
Kelly to sit out.

653
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,640
First shooters,
take your spot.

654
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,682
- All right, Kim!

655
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,309
- Let's go!

656
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,936
- (whooping)

657
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,272
- (Probst)
Grab an arrow, guys.

658
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,607
Ready.

659
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,526
Take your aim.

660
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,362
And fire.

661
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,446
- Close.

662
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,281
- Good job, good job.

663
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,449
- Good shot.

664
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,243
- Nice try.

665
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,452
- (Probst)
Next two.

666
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,832
- All right, Lindsey!

667
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,083
- (Probst)
Take your aim.

668
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,836
And fire.

669
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,631
- All right!

670
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,841
(cheering, whooping)

671
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,052
- (Probst)
Samburu up one-oh.

672
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,971
Ethan and Brandon,
you're up.

673
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,515
Ready.

674
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,683
Take your aim.

675
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,976
And fire.

676
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,060
- Aw.

677
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,063
- Close.

678
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,523
- (yells)

679
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,649
Sorry.

680
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,151
- (Probst)
Lex and Clarence.

681
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,486
Take your aim.

682
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,863
Fire.

683
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,324
(cheering)

684
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,534
That's a hit!

685
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,870
- Great!

686
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:11,499
- (Probst) Samburu two,
Boran one.

687
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,168
- All right, Big T!

688
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,170
- (Probst)
Fire at will.

689
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,050
Two good shots,
two misses.

690
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,304
Samburu two,
Boran one.

691
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,347
Round two.

692
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,267
- Come on,
you can do this.

693
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,394
- (Probst) Take your aim.

694
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,647
And fire.

695
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,194
No.

696
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,366
That's a hit.

697
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:45,909
Boran connects, two-two.

698
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,035
- Yeah!

699
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,455
- Nice, Ethan.

700
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,290
- All right, Lex.

701
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,374
(cheering)

702
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,375
- (Probst) Samburu hits.

703
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,294
Samburu up three-two.

704
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,755
And fire.

705
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,889
- Oh, my...

706
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,599
- (Probst)
That's a hit.

707
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,601
Three-three.
Tied up.

708
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:14,938
(cheering)

709
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:15,980
- Good job!

710
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,108
- All right, Tom!

711
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,820
- (Probst) Here's where we're
at-- Samburu leads four-three.

712
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:25,740
Almost, Frank.

713
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:28,076
Next round, guys.

714
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,118
Take your aim.

715
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,954
Fire.

716
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,414
- Oh!

717
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,918
- Okay, you were close.

718
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,253
- All right, Lindsey, you got
it, you got it.

719
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,254
You almost hit
this one last time.

720
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,380
- (Probst) Next two.

721
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,422
- You got it, Lindsey.

722
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,507
- All right,
Lindsey.

723
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,551
- Take your aim.

724
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,304
And fire.

725
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,430
- Yeah!

726
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,016
(whooping)

727
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,270
- Here's where we're at--

728
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,772
tied up, Samburu four,
Boran four.

729
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,987
Lindsey, you could win
immunity right here.

730
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,491
- Oh!

731
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,995
- (Probst) Next target hit
wins immunity.

732
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,038
All right, guys.

733
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,666
Fire at will.

734
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,880
- (speaks inaudibly)

735
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,513
- Yeah!

736
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,807
(cheering)

737
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,183
- (Probst)
Immunity for Boran!

738
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:38,646
- Yes! Yes!

739
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,357
- (Probst) Samburu, you know
what this means, right?

740
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,151
See you at Tribal Council.

741
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,998
♪♪

742
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,387
- We gave it
our best shot.

743
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,515
So we find ourselves faced with
Tribal Council today, which puts

744
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,686
us all in a potentially
vulnerable position.

745
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,397
Because now, you know,
we find ourselves having to...

746
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,107
to vote
someone out.

747
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,196
- You and I have not talked at
all about this thing tonight.

748
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,740
- Right, and you're trying to
figure out if I have a vote?

749
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,408
- No, I'm not... I'm not
here to ask you or gather

750
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,660
any information
from you.

751
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,370
That's not...
that's not what I'm...

752
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,414
I just wanted you guys to go
into this thing knowing however

753
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,166
we vote is not going
to be easy

754
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,751
for us, because we
like all of y'all.

755
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,878
- Right. I'm not taking
anything personal, and if y'all

756
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,046
vote for me, that's cool.

757
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,715
I mean, that's part of the game,
that's part of the game.

758
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,092
I'm totally prepared for it.

759
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,551
- All right.

760
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,970
- They are very likely to vote
for me, and that's fine.

761
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,723
I mean, I'm not going
to lose sleep about it.

762
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,392
I'm not going to lose sleep
about it anymore.

763
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,561
If we could just do the thing
tonight, it's going to be me,

764
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,648
and I can beat him, okay?

765
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,237
We were talking about going to
Tribal Council, and Kelly was

766
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,905
standing on
the other side of

767
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,573
the hut and we didn't
realize it.

768
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,244
So now Lindsey thinks that they
know she has votes.

769
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,745
- She heard everything.

770
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,996
Positive.

771
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,917
She went right over to Big Bear,
and they started talking.

772
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,420
I just, I can't believe that
Brandon didn't whisper, and she

773
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,963
was standing right there.

774
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,341
- That may have
just... me.

775
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,259
- He's, like, "I'm going to
make it through this, it's okay,

776
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,594
da-da-da-da-da."

777
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,763
So they've got this plan, and
they sound like they've had it

778
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,181
for, like, two or three
days now.

779
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,267
- If that's the way they're
going to vote, that's the way

780
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,309
they're going to vote.

781
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,770
There's nothing
we can do.

782
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,147
- Yeah, there is
something we can do.

783
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,273
- What?

784
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,984
- Vote with them.

785
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,320
- Vote with them?

786
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,656
You know, we made a pact with
Brandon in the beginning of this

787
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,451
game, but he screwed me over by
letting them overhear that

788
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,078
I have votes,
so I was... I was upset.

789
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,329
So right now,
I feel like this

790
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,124
is a selfish game and I'm
in it for myself.

791
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:03,750
We're not
Samburu anymore.

792
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,793
- You know what I mean?

793
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,296
- So you guys are going to...
relinquish Brandon?

794
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,298
- Yeah, I mean,
I just feel so bad, like,

795
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,634
selling someone out,
but...

796
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,512
- Everyone would look
really positively at it.

797
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,972
- Let me think about it.

798
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,016
- Yeah, just think about it,
we can talk after lunch.

799
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,976
Okay, that's fine.

800
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,812
- I just thought, oh, my God,
if this can secure them not

801
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,565
voting for me, I'll do it,
and this isn't cheating.

802
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,608
I'm not sticking
a card up my sleeve.

803
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,736
This is just making the right
move for myself.

804
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,198
So what if we vote against
Brandon, then what happens?

805
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,493
- It sounds like a kind of
a merger to me.

806
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,495
- And if we don't?

807
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,332
- Well, if not, it's going to
hurt everybody later.

808
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,460
- They're basically saying
align with us, we'll take you

809
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,712
further, and I'm just not
going to do it.

810
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,172
I'm not comfortable with it.

811
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,715
I know Brandon
wouldn't do it to me.

812
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,343
He wouldn't do it to me,
no matter what.

813
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,346
- I'm kind of in a no-win
situation.

814
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,183
I mean, do I go against my
personal morals and values

815
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,976
and vote against Brandon?

816
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,939
Or do I vote with Brandon and
Kim and risk being the next one

817
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,273
voted out of here?

818
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,859
I don't know what I'm going to
do, and I don't think I'll know

819
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,903
until I get to Tribal Council.

820
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,803
- How's it going, guys?

821
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,137
First time we've
had this configuration

822
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,598
here at Tribal
Council.

823
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,935
Lex, take me back to when you
had this new tribe formed.

824
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,186
How is that working out?

825
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,605
- It was a real shocker to
begin with, but I think we've

826
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,232
all acclimated pretty well.

827
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,316
We've kind of
come together as a tribe,

828
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,695
which makes a night like
tonight pretty tough.

829
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,405
- (Probst) Brandon,
at this point,

830
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,322
do you trust
these other five?

831
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,742
- I think that
as far as trust goes,

832
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,910
you don't trust anybody
in the game.

833
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,413
It's just, it's a fact of life,
one of us has to go,

834
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,332
and it may be me, may be
somebody else, we'll just see.

835
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,459
- (Probst) Kim, is this game
more ethically challenging

836
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,254
than you anticipated?

837
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,132
- Yes. I think that you either
decide that you're going to play

838
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,635
this for me, and I'm going to
get myself to be number one and

839
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,139
as far as I can, or you decide
I'm going to do this with value

840
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,100
and integrity and all of my own
ethics, and I don't think

841
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,518
that there's
a middle road anywhere.

842
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,354
- (Probst) Kelly, what started
out as Samburu and Boran,

843
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,106
are those
tribes just gone now?

844
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,773
- I wouldn't say they're
just gone.

845
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,775
Obviously, you know, we...

846
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,819
we're very close with some of
the people that were on Boran,

847
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,987
and we still have
loyalties to them,

848
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,906
but it just really opened up our
eyes that these people

849
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,948
are great,
and it's really changed up

850
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,116
the game in a lot of ways.

851
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,620
It's made everything
a lot harder.

852
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,121
- It's time to vote.

853
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,372
Brandon,
you're up first.

854
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,416
- (whispering) I hate having
to vote for this person.

855
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,671
I'd rather vote for myself right
now, 'cause this is miserable.

856
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,469
- I'll go tally the votes.

857
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,364
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

858
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,365
The person will be asked to

859
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,201
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

860
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,495
I'll read the votes.

861
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:14,041
First vote...

862
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,335
Big Tom.

863
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,425
Big Tom.

864
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,432
Lindsey.

865
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,646
Lindsey.

866
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,570
Tom.

867
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,654
- Hey.

868
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,448
- I'm so sorry.

869
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,409
- It's okay. Stop it.

870
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,661
It's me. Go.

871
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,582
- (Probst) Lindsey.

872
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,084
- Guys, it's a game!

873
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,961
- (Probst) Lindsey,
where are you going?

874
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,004
Sit it.

875
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,255
- (laughing)

876
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:03,758
- (Probst) That's three votes
Lindsey, three votes Tom.

877
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,842
We're going to vote again.

878
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,010
- Okay.

879
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,219
- (Probst)
But before we vote,

880
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,181
I'm going to give you guys
a chance to plead your case.

881
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,599
You're fighting for your life in
this game right now.

882
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,600
Be convincing.

883
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,603
Tom, you first.

884
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,607
- Well, only thing I can say
is, I'm who I am, I'm nobody

885
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,817
different, and I'm not
going to change.

886
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:26,572
So... that's... you got Big Tom
here, and that's the way it is.

887
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:30,451
- Lindsey, obviously tribal
lines coming into play here.

888
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,455
This is a chance for you to turn
somebody's vote around.

889
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,209
- Um, all I really want to say
is that I came to Tribal Council

890
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:42,463
tonight thinking, um,
the majority of them were going

891
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,299
to vote for Brandon,
and I considered it.

892
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,968
I considered joining with them
and voting for Brandon.

893
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,305
And on the way here, um...

894
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:55,184
(voice breaking)
...my dignity took over.

895
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:00,147
I don't care if I'm voted out
tonight, because I didn't vote

896
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,983
for a friend of mine, and that
makes me the happiest person on

897
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:03,818
the face of the Earth.

898
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,403
So I'm not
going to convince you

899
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:10,783
to keep me, 'cause I'm leaving
with my pride.

900
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,576
That's all.

901
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,829
- (Probst) Obviously, a tough
vote for you guys.

902
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,163
I believe that.

903
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,499
We got to do it again.

904
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,042
Lindsey and Tom,
you won't vote this time.

905
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,669
The other four of you will,

906
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,339
and you have to vote, obviously,
for Tom or for Lindsey.

907
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,361
I'll go tally the votes.

908
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,831
I'll read the re-vote.

909
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,212
First vote...

910
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,339
Big Tom.

911
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,136
Tom.

912
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,224
Lindsey.

913
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:26,525
And we're deadlocked.

914
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,906
Well, as you guys know, Tribal
Council is a place where you

915
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,157
account for your actions.

916
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,366
In the case of a deadlock,

917
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,286
we go to votes cast at previous
Tribal Councils.

918
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,955
Tom, how many votes have
you had cast against you?

919
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,582
- None that I know of.

920
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:41,999
- (Probst) Lindsey?

921
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:42,750
- A couple.

922
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,751
- (Probst) Four?

923
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,753
- Maybe.

924
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,087
- (Probst)
That's enough.

925
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,006
You need to bring me
your torch.

926
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,674
- Oh, stop it.

927
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,676
(speaking inaudibly)

928
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,601
It's okay.

929
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,770
It's a game, guys.

930
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,771
You're the best.

931
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,773
- I love you, too.

932
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:16,283
- Lindsey,
the tribe has spoken.

933
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,788
It's time for you to go.

934
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,789
Good night.

935
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,165
- Bye.

936
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,667
- We'll miss you.

937
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,798
- Well, clearly, in spite of
what was said tonight,

938
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,716
tribal lines still playing a big
part, because this was the most

939
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,886
emotional Tribal Council I think
we've ever had.

940
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,556
You guys can
head back to camp.

941
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,865
Stay tuned for scenes from our
next episode.

942
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,954
- (Probst) Next time on
<i>Survivor...</i>

943
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,999
The tribes eagerly anticipate
the traditional merge,

944
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,667
but anxieties run high.

945
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,836
- It is absolutely
horrible.

946
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,840
- (Probst) Because no one knows
how or when it will happen.

947
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,258
- Kind of like
standing on a corner

948
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,676
and the bus didn't
come by.

949
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,135
- Wake up, wake up.

950
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:16,844
Yo, we got mail.

951
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,471
It is big
and it is nasty.

952
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,271
- Tonight's vote was a
surprise.

953
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,023
I thought that they
would vote for Brandon.

954
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,066
I honestly don't think I could
have gone on much longer,

955
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,736
because this game is a serious
emotional roller coaster ride.

956
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,948
And, you know, I'm an athlete,
but I'd much rather do it in a

957
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,368
civilized environment, where I'm
not battling malicious behavior.

958
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,911
I don't like that aspect
of this game at all.

959
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,039
See you on the dark side.
