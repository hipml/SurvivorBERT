1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,752
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,587
>> JEFF, I'M A FORMER
SPECIAL AGENT.

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,755
>> YOU ARE A CRAZY PERSON.

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,048
>> Jeff: BEFORE THE MERGE,

5
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,925
BOTH TRIBES WERE RIFE
WITH INFIGHTING.

6
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,260
>> DAVID UNDER PRESSURE
IS REALLY STRESSING.

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,762
>> YOU'RE WRONG THERE.

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,930
DON'T EVEN GO THERE WITH THAT.

9
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,932
I DON'T FREAK OUT.

10
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,059
>> Jeff: BUT AFTER THE MERGE,

11
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,771
THE FORMER OMETEPE TRIBE AND THE
FORMER ZAPATERA TRIBE SET ASIDE

12
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,773
THEIR INTERNAL SQUABBLES BUT

13
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,775
STAYED DIVIDED
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,447
>> I WANT MY GROUP
TO HATE ZAPATERA.

15
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,490
>> Jeff: AND MATT WAS CAUGHT

16
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,285
BETWEEN THE TWO SO ROB
IMMEDIATELY TOOK HIM OUT.

17
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,788
>> HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED SO
BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GIVING HIM

18
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,458
A ONE-WAY TICKET BACK TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

19
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,333
>> WHAT THE HELL, GUYS.

20
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,335
>> Jeff: DOWN 6-5, THE FORMER

21
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,589
ZAPATERA HATCHED
A DESPERATE PLAN.

22
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,632
>> WE TOSSED AROUND THE IDEA OF

23
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,344
TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN WOO
SOME OF THE OMETEPE TRIBE.

24
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,346
>> Jeff: AT BACK-TO-BACK
TRIBAL COUNCILS THEY TRIED TO

25
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,308
CONVINCE THE OMETEPE LOW MAN
TO JUMP SHIP.

26
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,310
DAVID, OF THE SIX,
WHO IS ON THE BOTTOM?

27
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,353
>> WE THINK PHILLIP.

28
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,897
>> Jeff: BUT PHILLIP WOULDN'T

29
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,356
BUDGE AND PLAYED
THE HONOR AND DUTY CARD.

30
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,776
>> I SERVED IN THE
UNITED STATES ARMY

31
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,443
AND HAD THE SECOND
HIGHEST MEDAL

32
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,361
THEY GIVE DURING PEACE TIME.

33
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,488
>> GIVE IT UP.

34
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,489
>> I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP.

35
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,531
>> YOU SOUND LIKE A LUNATIC.

36
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,991
>> PHILLIP NEVER CEASES
TO AMAZE ME.

37
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,951
>> Jeff: SO MIKE WAS VOTED OUT.

38
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,329
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

39
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,580
AND SO WAS DAVID.

40
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,373
YOU WILL NOW HEAD TO REDEMPTION
ISLAND WHERE YOU WILL HAVE A

41
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,751
CHANCE TO GET BACK IN THE GAME.

42
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,710
ALL RIGHT.

43
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,753
>> Jeff: GOOD LUCK.

44
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,130
NOW RALPH, JULIE, AND STEVE FACE

45
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,675
A UNITED OMETEPE TRIBE
WHILE FOR THE FIRST TIME

46
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,679
THREE COMPETITORS FACE A DUEL
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

47
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,701
>> I CAN'T SLEEP.

48
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,953
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I'M

49
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,040
GOING TO PULL MYSELF UP BY MY
BOOTSTRAPS AND KEEP MY SANITY.

50
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,345
I JUST LICKED MY WOUNDS
AND BLEED FOR A LITTLE WHILE

51
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,764
AND HURT, BUT I WAS READY
TO KIND OF

52
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,393
GET IN THE MINDSET OF ALL RIGHT,
REDEMPTION ISLAND, PART TWO.

53
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,227
LET'S DO IT.

54
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,272
AND THEN CURVEBALL.

55
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,191
>> GOD, MY BROTHER
WOULDN'T QUIT.

56
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,443
MY DAD WOULDN'T QUIT.

57
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,071
YOU WOULD NEVER QUIT,
LORD JESUS,

58
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,073
AND YOUR SPIRIT LIVES IN ME.

59
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,449
>> TO MY ARRIVAL
AT REDEMPTION ISLAND

60
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,411
MATT AND MIKE ARE BOTH
STILL HERE SO LET'S SEE

61
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,037
IF I CAN MAKE SOME NOISE HERE

62
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,581
AND MAYBE GET BACK
INTO THE GAME.

63
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,582
>> OH, MY GOD.

64
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,624
>> WHO IS THAT?

65
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,959
>> IT'S MURPHY, DAVID MURPHY?

66
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,085
>> WHAT!

67
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:49,586
>> I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

68
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,420
WHERE AM I GOING?

69
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,590
>> WHAT IN THE WORLD, MAN?
WHAT...

70
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,468
DAVID ROLLS UP, AND, I MEAN,
MY MIND IS COMPLETELY

71
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,803
BLOWN AT THIS POINT.

72
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,679
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

73
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,640
LIKE, WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON.

74
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,060
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE--
WE HAVE TO HAVE A DUEL TOMORROW.

75
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,980
>> DUELS NOW ARE ALL
GOING TO BE THREE-PERSON DUELS.

76
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,691
>> OR WHAT IF THERE ISN'T--
I MEAN--

77
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,735
>> WHAT IF THIS IS THE LAST ONE?

78
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,403
>> I GUESS IF WE'RE ALREADY ALL

79
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,405
ON THE JURY-- THAT'S JUST WEIRD.

80
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,699
>> YEAH.

81
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,243
>> CAN YOU-- CAN YOU HAVE A DUEL
BETWEEN THREE PEOPLE?

82
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,495
>> THAT WOULD BE A TRIAL.

83
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,622
>> A TRUAL.

84
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,165
>> A TRUAL?

85
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,250
>> THIS IS CERTAINLY
AN INTERESTING CHOICE.

86
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,294
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
TO MAKE OF IT.

87
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,796
WHO KNOWS WHAT
THE OTHER TWIST MAY BE.

88
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,797
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE
WILL BE A DUEL

89
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,635
OR WHAT THE DUEL WILL BE
OR WHO WILL BE IN IT,

90
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,095
SO DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD
TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

91
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,139
>> GOOD NIGHT, ZAPATERA.

92
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,349
>> GOOD NIGHT, TEAM ZAPATERA.

93
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,977
>> THE ZAPATERA REJECTS.

94
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,486
>> ISN'T THE SKIN GOOD?

95
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,488
>> YUMMY, HUH?

96
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,158
>> I'M GLAD MY MOOD
CHANGED AROUND.

97
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,326
I WAS REALLY HAPPY DAVE
WENT OFF INSTEAD OF ME.

98
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,536
I WASN'T READY TO GO YET.

99
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,164
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY.

100
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,124
>> NO, THE WHOLE THING
WAS OCCUPIED BY PHIL.

101
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,668
>> UH-HUH.

102
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,795
>> FLAPPING HIS GUMS.

103
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,507
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL LAST NIGHT
WAS SIX ON 4, NOW SIX ON THREE

104
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,176
AGAINST RALPH, JULIE AND I,

105
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,220
AND AFTER DAVE'S PERFORMED
SO WELL

106
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,722
THE LAST COUPLE OF CHALLENGES,
WE LOSE DAVE.

107
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,016
AND WE JUST THREW
ALL FOUR OF OURS AT ROB

108
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,894
AND WOMP-WOMP.

109
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,401
>> AND I JUST HAVEN'T REALLY
FIGURED PHILLIP OUT.

110
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,529
I CAN'T IMAGINE SOMEBODY
ALWAYS BEING THAT STRANGE.

111
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,366
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
HE DOES BUGS US,

112
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,536
BUT THE REST OF OMETEPE
ARE STICKING TO HIM LIKE GLUE.

113
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,623
BOSTON ROB'S GOT THEM ALL
VERY TIGHT.

114
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,545
I'M NOT SURE IF PHILLIP IS EVEN
A GOOD GUY AT HEART,

115
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,047
BUT HE'S DOING HIS THING.
HE'S OUT HERE SURVIVING.

116
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,383
I TAKE MY HAT OFF TO HIM.

117
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,055
THE ONLY HOPE
WE CAN HANG OUR HAT ON

118
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,018
IS HOW IRRITATED THEY
COULD BE WITH PHILLIP.

119
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,477
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE.

120
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,925
>> WHEN I GOT INTO BUDDHISM,

121
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,137
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU LEARN
IS YOUR SPIRIT

122
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,431
IS INTERCONNECTED
TO EVERY SINGLE LIVING THING,

123
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:54,479
INCLUDING THE TATHAGATA,
WHICH YOU MIGHT CALL GOD

124
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,440
OR ALLAH OR BUDDHA.

125
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,609
IT WILL MANIFEST ITSELF
IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

126
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,778
YOU CAN HEAR IT.

127
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,987
YOU CAN FEEL IT.

128
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,530
AND YOU JUST HAVE
TO BE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT

129
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,866
FOR WHAT IT IS AND CHANNEL THAT.

130
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,578
I DID A MEDITATION THIS MORNING.

131
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,331
I WAS FOCUSING ON MY ANCESTORS.

132
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,083
YOU KNOW, I HAD A PREMONITION

133
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,586
THROUGH MY GRANDFATHER AND I

134
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,464
TOOK THAT AS AN INDICATION THAT

135
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,175
AS MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ROB.

136
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,302
I THINK IT HAS FINALLY COME TO

137
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,595
WHAT I CALL THE FULL CIRCLE
OF TRUST.

138
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,431
AND I'M GOING TO PLAY MY ROLE.

139
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,474
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT
PURSUING THE MILLION DOLLARS

140
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,977
BECAUSE I'LL BE HERE
AT THE END OF THE GAME.

141
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,946
>> IT'S READY.

142
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,571
DO YOU WANT TO EAT IT?

143
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,990
>> YEAH.

144
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,034
>> THE FOOD SITUATION FOR THE

145
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,619
OLD ZAPATERA TRIBE IS--
IS GREAT.

146
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,372
WE HAVE A TON OF RICE LEFT.

147
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,124
AND WE'RE EATING IT.

148
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,625
>> THERE'S SO MUCH RICE LEFT.

149
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,043
>> PRETTY GOOD.

150
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,002
>> AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO EAT

151
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,713
AND ENJOY AND AT LEAST
WE WON'T BE HUNGRY.

152
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,842
THE HUNGER HAS BEEN TOUGH
BUT WE'RE HAPPY NOW.

153
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,136
WE'RE HAPPY IN THE FOOD FIELD.

154
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,137
>> YOU GOOD?

155
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,179
>> YEAH, I'M GOOD.

156
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,848
>> YOU WERE JUST EATING
TO FINISH IT?

157
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,516
>> I WOULDN'T WANT IT
TO GO TO WASTE.

158
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,852
>> LIFE'S PRETTY GOOD, MAN.

159
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,062
>> THE RICE SITUATION
IS PRETTY UGLY.

160
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,856
THIS MORNING, JULIE WAS ABLE TO

161
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,483
SCOOP SEVEN AND A HALF SCOOPS OF

162
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,860
RICE OUT OF THAT COOKED POT.

163
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,987
IN OUR OLD TRIBE WE WOULD HAVE

164
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,824
TWO OF THOSE SEA SHELLS,
ONE, TWO.

165
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,075
DONE.

166
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,664
>> I WANT TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET EVEN.

167
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,500
>> I CONTEND THAT SHE'S TRYING

168
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,043
TO USE UP THE RICE
BEFORE THEY GO.

169
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,879
>> I PLAN ON SCOOPING QUITE A
BIT OF RICE

170
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,754
OUT OF THEIR TIN
AND PUTTING IT IN OURS.

171
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,840
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

172
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,676
ALL RICE HERE BELONGS
TO ALL OF US.

173
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,179
>> PHILLIP IS THE RICE POLICE.

174
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,559
>> I'M NOW WATCHING
THE ZAPATERA LIKE A LION.

175
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,852
IT'S TRIVIAL.

176
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,811
BUT, APPARENTLY, THAT'S THE

177
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,732
STATE OF THE WORLD TODAY
AND MURLONIO TRIBE.

178
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,110
>> PLEASE BE TREE MAIL.

179
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,070
PLEASE BE TREE MAIL.

180
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,572
>> WE GOT SOMETHING.

181
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,742
>> YAY!

182
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,077
>> "AS COMFORTABLE
AS YOU ALL MAY BE,

183
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,413
IT'S TIME AGAIN
FOR YOU ALL TO SEE

184
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:20,208
A BATTLE BETWEEN THOSE OUTCAST

185
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,709
WHO WILL LEAVE
AND WHO WILL LAST."

186
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,628
>> "TIME AGAIN FOR ALL TO SEE."

187
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,838
>> SWEET!

188
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,269
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

189
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,939
THE COMPETITORS
FOR TODAY'S DUEL.

190
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,651
MATT, MIKE, AND DAVID.

191
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,244
WELCOME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND
ARENA.

192
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,622
WE INVITED THE REST OF THE TRIBE
TO WITNESS YOUR DUEL.

193
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,709
MATT, BACK-TO-BACK BLINDSIDES.

194
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,796
WHERE'S YOUR EMOTIONAL
STATE OF MIND RIGHT NOW?

195
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,800
>> I NEVER KNEW THAT STRANGERS
COULD HURT ME SO DEEPLY.

196
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,511
UM, I MEAN, I GUESS SHAME ON ME

197
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,513
FOR LETTING THEM FOOL ME
TWICE, YOU KNOW.

198
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,975
IT HURTS, BUT I'M READY
TO KEEP GOING IF I CAN.

199
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,810
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SHOULD WE
GET TO TODAY'S DUEL?

200
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,811
>> YES.

201
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,812
>> ABSOLUTELY.

202
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,980
>> Jeff: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

203
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,482
EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE
150 WOODEN TILES.

204
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:30,111
YOU WILL USE THOSE TILES
TO BUILD A HOUSE OF CARDS.

205
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:34,156
THE FIRST TWO TO REACH
EIGHT FEET STAY ALIVE.

206
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,783
LOSER IS OUT FOR GOOD AND WILL

207
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,911
BECOME THE FIRST MEMBER
OF OUR JURY.

208
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,621
>> WOOO!

209
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,294
>> Jeff: YOU GUYS READY
TO GET TO THIS?

210
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,295
>> YEAH.

211
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,296
>> YES.

212
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,297
>> Jeff: THIS IS IT.

213
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,298
ONE SHOT.

214
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,300
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

215
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,346
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

216
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,722
SURVIVORS READY?

217
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,433
GO.

218
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,521
THE ONLY BASIC RULE IS YOU

219
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:08,691
CANNOT STACK THESE JUST FLAT
ONE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

220
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,902
YOU HAVE TO BUILD
A TRADITIONAL HOUSE OF CARDS.

221
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,053
>> Jeff: MIKE NOT
MESSING AROUND,

222
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,388
RIGHT AROUND THE SIX-FOOT MARK.

223
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,224
MATT AROUND THE FIVE-FOOT MARK.

224
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,726
>> OH, BOY.

225
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,228
>> Jeff: DAVID HOVERING
AROUND THREE FEET.

226
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,649
THIS STACK IS SO TALL, MIKE IS
NOW MOVING TO THE LADDER.

227
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,403
GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER
TO THAT EIGHT-FOOT MARK.

228
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,781
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FIRST.

229
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,575
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO BE LAST.

230
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,993
MIKE GETTING VERY CLOSE.

231
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,787
>> NICE, MIKE.

232
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,747
>> Jeff: ALMOST THERE.

233
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,292
ONE MORE STACK
WILL DO IT FOR MIKE.

234
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,129
IF HE CAN JUST REMAIN CALM.

235
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:12,922
MATT DOING VERY WELL.

236
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,258
DAVID CATCHING UP QUICKLY.

237
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,885
MIKE IS JUST SHORT.

238
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,930
THIS WILL DO IT.

239
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,358
GOTTA GET THAT TO LAY
ON ITS OWN.

240
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,034
MIKE FLIRTING WITH DISASTER,
BEING VERY CAREFUL,

241
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,953
DOES NOT WANT TO LOSE
THIS STACK.

242
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,038
NOT WITH MATT BREATHING
DOWN HIS NECK

243
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,957
AND DAVID RIGHT BEHIND.

244
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,376
DAVID IS NOW BACK IN IT.

245
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,961
DAVID'S ON HIS LADDER.

246
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,089
MATT GETTING CLOSER.

247
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,175
MIKE HAS A VERY TALL STACK.

248
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,305
JUST DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE IT.

249
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,686
MATT GETTING VERY CLOSE NOW
TO FINISHING.

250
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,147
DAVID GETTING CLOSER
TO FINISHING.

251
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,525
MIKE IS LESS THAN A HALF
AN INCH AWAY.

252
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,611
GOTTA REACH THE TOP OF THE POST.

253
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,326
IF HE CAN STACK IT AND GET
HIS HANDS AWAY AND HE DOES.

254
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:24,869
MIKE IS GOOD.

255
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,911
MIKE STAYS ALIVE.

256
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,330
MATT IS VERY CLOSE.

257
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:28,998
CAN HE DO IT RIGHT HERE?

258
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,667
DAVID TRYING TO GET IN IT.

259
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,005
MATT DOES IT.

260
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,799
MIKE AND MATT STAY ALIVE!

261
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,509
( APPLAUSE )

262
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,844
>> NICE TRY, DAVE.

263
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,012
>> GOOD CHALLENGE, EVERYBODY.

264
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,353
>> GOOD TRY, DAVID.

265
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,438
>> NICE TRY, DAVE.

266
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,693
>> Jeff: MIKE, FIRST DUEL,
DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

267
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,194
YOU STAY ALIVE.

268
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,028
>> IT FEELS GOOD.

269
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,447
THANK YOU, JEFF, THANK YOU.

270
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,033
>> Jeff: MATT, SEVEN STRAIGHT
DUELS YOU HAVE STAYED ALIVE.

271
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,535
SEIZING THAT MOMENT ONCE AGAIN.

272
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,080
DAVID, AFTER 25 VERY TOUGH DAYS

273
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,875
IN THIS GAME, YOUR SHOT
AT THE MONEY IS OVER.

274
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,126
YOU WILL RETURN TO THE NEXT

275
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,046
TRIBAL COUNCIL AS THE FIRST
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

276
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,008
YOU CAN TOSS YOUR BUFF
IN THE URN ON YOUR WAY OUT.

277
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,051
>> BYE, DAVID!

278
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,136
( APPLAUSE )

279
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,681
>> I SAW REDEMPTION ISLAND AS

280
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,892
A CHANCE TO FURTHER MYSELF
IN THE GAME.

281
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,935
UNFORTUNATELY, MY PLAN DIDN'T

282
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,605
WORK AS WELL AS I WOULD
LIKE FOR IT TO HAVE.

283
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,233
I THINK THIS HAS GIVEN ME
A REALLY FRESH OUTLOOK

284
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,026
AND DETERMINATION TO TACKLE

285
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,071
EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO AND JUST
VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR THAT.

286
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,449
>> DAVID'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST
MEMBER OF THE JURY.

287
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,409
WE'LL TRY TO SEND PEOPLE
TO THE DUEL

288
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,537
TO BEAT OTHER PEOPLE
WHO ARE ALREADY THERE--

289
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,246
NAMELY, MATT.

290
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,914
WE SENT MIKE AND WE SENT DAVID,

291
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,626
AND DAVID FAILED SO MATT
IS STILL IN THERE.

292
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:00,089
IF HE COMES BACK AND BEATS ME,
IT'S OVER.

293
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,715
>> Jeff: MATT AND MIKE,
CONGRATULATIONS.

294
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,050
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE IN THIS GAME.

295
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,718
YOU CAN HEAD BACK
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

296
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,596
AND AWAIT YOUR NEXT DUEL
AND YOUR NEXT OPPONENT.

297
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,681
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

298
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,765
>> GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

299
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,101
>> SEE YOU, GUYS.

300
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:12,977
>> GOD'S CONTINUED TO GIVE ME

301
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,771
THE STRENGTH DAY AFTER DAY.

302
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,106
HE'S GIVEN ME NEW HOPE, AND IF

303
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,818
IT'S HIS WILL,
THEN I'LL CONTINUE TO WIN.

304
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,571
AND TRY TO TAKE ROB OUT.

305
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,084
>> I WANT, LIKE, A POT.

306
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,128
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

307
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,588

316

ROB, WE HAVE, LIKE, MAGGOTS
OR SOMETHING IN HERE.

317
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,276
>> WHAT?

318
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,986
>> I OPENED THE RICE, AND I

319
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,112
DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE
SOME MAGGOTS.

320
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,156
>> SICK.

321
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,824
>> PHIL DECIDED HE WANTED TO

322
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,659
DUMP ALL THE RICE
ON TO A BLANKET.

323
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,661
SO WE SEPARATED THE MAGGOTS AND

324
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,998
WE DUMPED THE REST OF THE BAD
RICE INTO THE OCEAN.

325
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,499
>> LET'S PUT IT
IN THEIR CONTAINER

326
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,417
AND WE'LL JUST ALL USE
THE SAME CONTAINER.

327
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,127
>> THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO WANT TO DO THAT.

328
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,795
I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT
IF I WERE THEM.

329
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,005
>> WE HAVE NOWHERE
TO PUT OUR RICE.

330
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,132
OUR RICE IS ON THE BLANKET WITH

331
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,051
ALL THE BUGS AND DIRT
GETTING INTO IT.

332
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,970
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO EAT
FOR THE REST OF THE TIME?

333
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,013
>> BON APPETITE.

334
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,265
>> HOW NASTY MUST THAT BE.

335
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,893
>> OUR RICE IS ALL, LIKE--
THERE'S, LIKE, MAGGOTS

336
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,811
AND MOLD IN IT,
SO WE JUST DUMPED OUT

337
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,188
ALL THE GOOD RICE
AND SEPARATED IT.

338
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,939
COULD WE PUT ALL OF OUR RICE
IN YOURS?

339
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,274
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

340
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,193
I DON'T THINK SO.

341
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,987
I DON'T THINK RALPH
WOULD GO FOR IT, EITHER.

342
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,573
>> I'LL TELL THEM.

343
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,240
>> I DON'T THINK SO, DO YOU?

344
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,576
>> NO.

345
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,203
>> IT'S AN EYE OPENER
TO SEE INDIVIDUALS

346
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,122
BEHAVE THE WAY THEY
ARE CURRENTLY BEHAVING,

347
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,960
EVEN IN A "GAME SURVIVOR"
ENVIRONMENT.

348
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,128
SO TO ME, YOU COULD PROBABLY

349
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,714
LEAVE HERE WITH SOME DAMAGES

350
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,341
POTENTIALLY TO SEE JUST HOW BAD

351
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,258
HUMAN BEINGS WILL CONDUCT

352
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:12,888
THEMSELVES IN AN ENVIRONMENT
LIKE THIS.

353
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,684
>> THE OTHER RICE
IS PERFECTLY FINE.

354
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,602
OUR CONTAINER HAD A LEAK
IN THE BOTTOM OF IT.

355
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,729
IT GOT WET AND IT MOLDED,
BUT THE RICE

356
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,773
THAT'S ON THAT TOWEL
IS PERFECTLY GOOD RICE.

357
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,732
THAT'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.

358
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,401
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

359
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,735
I'M GOING TO TALK
ABOUT IT WITH RALPH.

360
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,278
>> LOOK, YOU GUYS
AREN'T BEING REASONABLE.

361
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,822
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT
LOGICALLY.

362
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,782
IT'S NOT A ZAPATERA DECISION.

363
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,741
IT'S OUR RICE.

364
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,076
ANYWAY, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THIS ARGUMENT.

365
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,620
ONCE THE TRIBES MERGED,

366
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,247
ONLY THE REWARDS ARE SEPARATE.

367
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,083
THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE.

368
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,919
>> WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN SMART
TO TALK ABOUT THIS

369
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,254
BEFORE YOU DUMPED IT
ALL OUT, PHILLIP?

370
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,214
>> NO, BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THAT DEBATE WITH YOU.

371
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,758
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE RICE
OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAINER.

372
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,595
I ASKED, UNLESS YOU WALK
WITH THAT CAN,

373
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,430
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I HAVE

374
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,473
TO TAKE THAT CAN
AND HIDE IT, I WILL.

375
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,267
>> SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'D
BE THREATENING MY TRIBE

376
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,769
WITH PHYSICALLY
TAKING SOMETHING.

377
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,146
>> YOU'RE THREATENING THE TRIBE
RIGHT NOW BY SAYING

378
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,273
GO AHEAD AND LET THAT
ON THE GROUND SPOIL.

379
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:09,236
THE LONGER IT IS OUT HERE
MOISTURE IS GETTING TO IT.

380
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,404
>> YOU ( BLEEP ).

381
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,822
>> I'LL PUT IT BLUNT TO YOU.

382
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,116
UNLESS YOU WALK WITH THAT
( BLEEP ) CAN EVERYWHERE YOU GO,

383
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,576
I'M GOING TO PUT
THE RICE IN THERE

384
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,535
AND YOU WILL COME ASK ME
FOR THE RICE.

385
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,912
I'M A VERY REASONABLE PERSON
TO DEAL WITH.

386
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,247
>> YOU'RE NOT REASONABLE
AT ALL, DUDE.

387
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,498
YOU'RE A ( BLEEP ) LUNATIC.

388
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,958
>> I KNOW I AM.

389
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,626
THAT'S THE ONE THING
YOU NEVER WANT TO FORGET.

390
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,335
>> YOU'RE A DANGEROUS MAN.

391
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,296
>> YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT.

392
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,757
YOU NEED TO KEEP THAT
IN YOUR MINDSET.

393
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,385
THAT'S YOUR PERCEPTION,
ANY TIME SOMEBODY OF MY COLOR

394
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,388
GETS UP IN ONE OF YOUR FACES,

395
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,140
THEN YOU FEEL LIKE I'M
A LUNATIC. I'M CRAZY.

396
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,350
>> HE JUST BROUGHT IN
THE RACE CARD.

397
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,477
>> DID HE REALLY?

398
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,978
>> NOW YOU'RE MAKING IT
A BLACK THING?

399
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:43,771
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S
WHAT THIS

400
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,606
IS ALL ABOUT
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

401
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,524
YOU'RE THE ONE RAISING THE ISSUE
CALLING ME A LUNATIC.

402
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,525
>> PHILLIP--

403
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,652
>> EXCUSE ME.

404
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,739
>> YOU'RE BRINGING THIS TO
A BLACK AND WHITE THING NOW?

405
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,865
WOW.

406
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,158
>> I MADE THE ARGUMENT
WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP THE RICE

407
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,994
OUTSIDE OF THAT CAN
AND YOU TOLD ME I'M

408
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:01,497
A BLEEP LUNATIC BECAUSE
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

409
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,373
AND THAT'S NOT
A RATIONAL ARGUMENT.

410
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,333
YOU MAKE THE DECISIONS
YOU NEED TO MAKE

411
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,335
AND I'LL MAKE THE DECISIONS
I NEED TO MAKE.

412
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,046
MANO A MANO IF WE HAVE TO.

413
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,673
I'M THE CHIEF
OF COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE.

414
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,387
WANG CHUNG KUNG FU EXPERT HERE.

415
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,267
>> IT'S LIKE WATCHING
DIVORCE COURT.

416
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,063
>> HE FEELS LIKE HE'S
BETTER THAN ME,

417
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,356
YOU KNOW, AND I THINK
IT HAS SOME SLIGHT

418
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,817
RACIAL UNDERTONES TO IT.

419
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,362
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT GO TO THE
NEXT LEVEL TO "YOU'RE CRAZY."

420
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,197
WHEN HE SAID THAT, I SAID,
"DON'T FORGET THAT.

421
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,865
I AM CRAZY."

422
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,702
>> HE WAS OVER HERE
JUST FREAKING OUT.

423
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,579
>> I'M LIKE A LOT OF BLACK MEN.

424
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,581
WE'RE PREPARED TO SELF-DESTRUCT
AT ANY MOMENT

425
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,167
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
TO A LOT OF BLACK MEN.

426
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,670
THEY DO SELF-DESTRUCT,
AND BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM!

427
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,214
I'M NOT LOOKING
TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

428
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,884
YOU DON'T START NONE,
THERE WON'T BE NONE.

429
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,719
BUT IF YOU START IT
I'M GOING TO FINISH IT

430
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,930
BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'VE GOT ANYTHING TO LOSE

431
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,723
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET
ON THE JURY

432
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,349
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO VOTE FOR ME.

433
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,518
THEY'RE GOING TO ASK ME,

434
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,895
GET DOWN ON THEIR KNEES
AND BEG FOR THE RICE.

435
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,898
"PLEASE, LET ME HAVE SOME RICE,
MR. CHARLIE."

436
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,775
>> RALPH, RALPH,
HE WAS MAKING DECISIONS

437
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,194
FOR THE TRIBE
AND KEPT PUSHING THE ISSUE

438
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,404
AND THEN HE TOOK IT
TO BLACK AND WHITE,

439
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:20,742
LIKE WE WERE HAVING SOME
RACIAL ISSUE OR SOMETHING.

440
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,661
>> I JUST NOTICED
THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME

441
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,872
I MAKE AN ISSUE
WITH THE PEOPLE

442
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,791
OF THE FORMER ZAPATERA TRIBE,
SUDDENLY A GUY

443
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,377
WHO IS ABLE TO BECOME
A FEDERAL AGENT--

444
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,962
>> WHATEVER.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

445
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,089
>> SUDDENLY BECOMES
( BLEEP ) CRAZY.

446
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,257
YOU NOW CALLED ME CRAZY.

447
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,593
YOU ARE CRAZY.

448
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,761
EVERY TIME I MAKE THAT ARGUMENT,
SUDDENLY I'M CRAZY.

449
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,390
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WITH SOME WHITE FOLKS.

450
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,934
THEY LIKE TO TAKE A BLACK MAN
AND MAKE THEM CRAZY

451
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,270
WHEN HE MAKES AN ARGUMENT
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

452
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,313
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT
TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

453
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,232
RIGHT THERE, BUDDY.

454
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,946
>> NO, EVERY TIME I MAKE AN
ARGUMENT WITH ONE OF THOSE GUYS

455
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,448
IT'S I'M ( BLEEP ) CRAZY.

456
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,824
THAT'S ( BLEEP ) CRAZY.

457
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,409
GET OUT OF MY FACE WITH THAT.

458
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,327
I'M TIRED OF HEARING
THAT ( BLEEP ).

459
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,871
I'M TIRED OF
HEARING THAT ( BLEEP ).

460
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,248
EVERY TIME I MAKE AN ARGUMENT
WITH SOMEBODY AROUND HERE.

461
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,750
THAT ( BLEEP ) HAS TO BE CRAZY.

462
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,002
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

463
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,629
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO JAIL.

464
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,505
I'VE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED.

465
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,092
BUT SUDDENLY I'M CRAZY
ON A LITTLE ISLAND

466
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,844
WITH A COUPLE OF DUDES
BECAUSE I'M TELLING THEM

467
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,304
HEY, MAN, I HAVE SOME BAD RICE.

468
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,306
I WANT TO PUT IT
IN A GOOD CONTAINER.

469
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,976
>> CRAZY, CRAZY,
PHIL BEING CRAZY PHIL,

470
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,772
TAKING IT TO THE "N" WORD
IS PRETTY WACKY.

471
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,106
IT'S DEGRADING.

472
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,107
IT'S NOT A CHIP.

473
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,442
IT'S A LOG ON HIS SHOULDER.

474
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,320
I'D JUST AS SOON TURN MY BACK
AND WALK AWAY FROM IT.

475
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,280
>> WE'RE VOTING FOR PHIL
TOMORROW.

476
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,910
JUST A THOUGHT.

477
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:45,452
>> HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.

478
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,163
HE'S A LOOSE CANNON.

479
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,373
AND A LITTLE SCARY, TOO.

480
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,668
SO THE QUICKER WE CAN GET HIM
OUT OF HERE,

481
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,297
I THINK THE WHOLE TRIBE
WOULD BE IN BETTER SHAPE.

482
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,675
>> ZERO SOCIAL SKILLS.

483
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,177
HE'S UNSTABLE, MAN.

484
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,637
>> YEAH.

485
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,555
>> SOMETHING LIKE THAT DOESN'T
LAST IN THE C.I.A.,

486
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,017
OR ANY
INVESTIGATION THING.

487
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,687
>> MAYBE THAT'S WHY
HE'S NOT WORKING FOR THEM.

488
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,855
>> MAYBE HE WAS DISCARDED
OR SOMETHING.

489
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,359
>> I DON'T MIND SO MUCH HIM
PICKING ON THE OTHER TRIBE,

490
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,361
BUT YOU CAN JUST SEE
THAT ONCE THEY'RE GONE,

491
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,530
THAT OLD PHILLIP'S
COMING BACK.

492
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,865
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

493
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,158
>> UH-HUH.

494
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,327
>> WHAT STARTED OFF
AS A FRIENDLY LITTLE SONG

495
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,206
BETWEEN GRANT AND I
TURNED INTO AN EXPLOSION.

496
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,542
PHILLIP SOMEHOW MANAGED

497
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:38,922
TO MAKE A WAR ABOUT
WHITE RICE RACIAL.

498
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,882
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.

499
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,591
IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.

500
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,552
>> I WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

501
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,012
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE

502
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,555
WITH HIM BRINGING UP
THE RACE CARD, TOO.

503
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,431
>> AND DROPPING THE "N" WORD.

504
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,392
AT THE END OF THE DAY, PHILLIP

505
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,227
WILL BE PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.

506
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,937
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO TO MAKE

507
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,063
PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER TWO.

508
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,693
>> I'D STILL RATHER DIE
THAN KEEP HIM AROUND, THOUGH.

509
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,094
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

510
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,355
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

511
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,440
>> ABSOLUTELY.

512
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,150
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
ANDREA.

513
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,568
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT UP.

514
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,077
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY

00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:02,644

STEVE VERY CLOSE.

597
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,528
ROB STEPS AWAY.

598
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,529
THINKS HE HAS IT.

599
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,571
>> STEVE'S DONE.

600
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,572

601
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,073
ROB WINS IMMUNITY!

602
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,493

>> WAY TO GO, BABY!

604
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,915
>> ROBBIE.

605
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,127
>> Jeff: ROB, COME ON OVER.

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,794
( APPLAUSE )

607
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,130
NICE WORK.

608
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,840
FINISHED FIRST IN EACH ROUND.

609
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,342
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

610
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,678
ROB IS SAFE AT TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

611
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,721
( APPLAUSE )

612
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,180
>> YA!

613
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,724
>> Jeff: GUARANTEED AT LEAST
ONE MORE DAY IN THIS GAME.

614
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:45,186
EVERYBODY ELSE, AFTER 27 DAYS,

615
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,688
ONE OF YOU WILL BE VOTED OUT

616
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,523
AND SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

617
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,525
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE
OUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.

618
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,695
I WILL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

619
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,031
>> THE CHALLENGE
WAS A CLOSE ONE FOR ME.

620
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,033
BUT I DROPPED THE BALL.

621
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,909
THERE'S THREE OF US RIGHT NOW
LEFT IN ZAPATERA.

622
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,537
OUR TARGET IS PHIL.

623
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,497
IF TWO OF THEM WOULD CHANGE

624
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,833
THEIR MIND AND VOTE
FOR PHIL, BAM.

625
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,835
IT'S THE ONLY SHOT WE GOT.

626
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:29,856
>> I DON'T KNOW.

627
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,863
>> DAMN, THAT'S GOOD.

628
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,325
>> I HAVE NEVER EATEN SO MUCH
RICE IN MY LIFE.

629
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,080
TONIGHT'S GOING TO BE
AN EASY VOTE.

630
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:45,997
THERE ARE JUST THREE OF US.

631
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,792
OLD ZAPATERA,
AND THERE ARE SIX OF THEM.

632
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,752
SO THE THREE OLD ZAPATERA
ARE VOTING FOR PHILLIP.

633
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,755
REALLY, WE ONLY NEED
TWO MORE VOTES,

634
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,716
OR ONE OF US OLD ZAPATERA
ARE LEAVING.

635
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,386
THE OMETEPE TRIBE
HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS NOW

636
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,222
WHERE THEY CAN GET RID
OF SOMEBODY, SO TONIGHT

637
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,848
WOULD BE A GREAT NIGHT
TO GET RID OF PHILLIP.

638
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,899
PHILLIP'S RIGHT-- IT'S WAR.

639
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,320
PHILLIP IS GOING TO HAVE
TO HANG OUT

640
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,864
IN HIS CUTE LITTLE UNDERWEAR
FROM NOW ON.

641
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,833
I DON'T THINK HE'LL EVER
FIND THOSE.

642
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,812
>> MY SWIM TRUNKS
WERE ON THE LINE.

643
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,188
DID ANY OF YOU GIRLS MOVE THEM?

644
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,440
>> NO.

645
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,983
>> DID ANY OF YOU GUYS
MOVE MY SWIM TRUNKS?

646
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:55,817
>> I DIDN'T SEE THEM.

647
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,986
>> OKAY, THEY MUST HAVE GOT LEGS

648
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:02,323
AND WALKED AWAY
ALL ON THEIR OWN.

649
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,616
THAT'S OKAY.

650
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,993
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

651
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,871
IT CAN GET REAL FUN
AND EXCITING AROUND HERE.

652
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:12,333
>> EVERYBODY IN CAMP
IS OVER PHILLIP.

653
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,336
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS I KNOW
MY TRUNKS WERE TAKEN.

654
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,672
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
I CAN PLAY THAT GAME.

655
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,507
I CAN PLAY THAT GAME.

656
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,009
>> PHILLIP SAYS ALL THE TIME

657
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,553
THAT, YOU KNOW,
HE WAS A SPECIAL AGENT

658
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,264
AND HE KNOWS HOW TO READ PEOPLE.

659
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,558
>> YOU'RE FROM
THE BIG HOUSE, RIGHT?

660
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,311
YOU FROM THE BIG HOUSE?

661
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,688
>> CRAZY PHILLIP
WHO WEARS FEATHERS

662
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,523
AND PINK UNDERWEAR.

663
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,901
HONESTLY, I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET RID OF PHILLIP.

664
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,319
>> I HOPE MY SHORTS
COME UP TONIGHT

665
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,695
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T
COME UP TONIGHT,

666
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,030
IT'S GOING TO GET REAL
INTERESTING AROUND HERE.

667
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,699
>> I'M FEELING THREATENED.

668
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,367
>> I'M FEELING THREATENED TOO.

669
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,036
>> YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL
THREATENED BY ME.

670
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,163
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY
THREATEN PEOPLE.

671
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,249
I JUST GO OFF LIKE THAT.
I JUST GO OFF LIKE THAT.

672
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,584
>> THAT'S KIND OF SCARY.

673
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,085
>> IT SHOULD BE.

674
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,088
YOU KEEP TELLING ME I'M CRAZY.
YOU KEEP TELLING ME I'M CRAZY.

675
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,719
>> THIS AIN'T THE NFL.

676
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,054
IN THE NFL, THEY GOT RULES.

677
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,474
THEY GOT REFEREES.

678
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,568
>> CHECK HIM OUT.

679
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,079
>> PHIL MADE A TOTAL ASS
OUT OF HIMSELF,

680
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:36,000
GETTING RACIAL ABOUT RICE
AND CRAZY STUFF,

681
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,045
AND I WOULD REALLY THINK
WITH ANY KIND OF DIGNITY,

682
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:43,675
HE'D APOLOGIZE
FOR YOUR ASININE BEHAVIOR

683
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,761
BUT HE HASN'T SAID A WORD.

684
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,764
THE OMETEPE TRIBE
DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM, EITHER.

685
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:54,185
MAYBE SOMEBODY MIGHT SWAY
THE VOTE AND VOTE OUR WAY.

686
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,940
>> TONIGHT, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO WE TARGET, REALLY.

687
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,944
YOU GOT RALPH, YOU GOT STEVE,
AND JULIE.

688
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,154
BUT, I DON'T KNOW.

689
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:10,368
I LOVE PHILLIP, BUT, I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS HEAD IS.

690
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:14,581
THERE IS ROOM TO PLAY,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE.

691
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,294
ONE MAN SHOULD NOT HAVE
THIS MUCH POWER ON AN ISLAND,

692
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,463
BUT I'M GRATEFUL THAT I DO.

693
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:34,767
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

694
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,855
THE FIRST MEMBER
OF OUR JURY, DAVID.

695
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,113
PHILLIP, BASED ON WHAT
YOU'RE WEARING,

696
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,699
I'M GUESSING YOU HAD
ANOTHER MEDITATION.

697
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,994
>> I ACTUALLY HAD A FORMER ZAP.

698
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,205
THINK IT WAS CUTE AND
STEAL MY CLOTHES.

699
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,915
THOUGHT IT WAS REAL FUNNY.

700
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,375
>> Jeff: DID YOU LOOK AT STEVE?

701
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,170
>> YEAH, I LOOKED AT STEVE
BECAUSE I COULD TELL

702
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,380
THAT HE WAS THE ONE
WHO REMOVED MY CLOTHES.

703
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,673
>> Jeff: AND YOU COULD TELL--

704
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,507
THIS GOES BACK
TO YOUR FORMER TRAINING?

705
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,302
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I CONFRONTED STEVE

706
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,219
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY
WERE DELIBERATELY

707
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,847
CONSUMING ALL THE RICE.

708
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:16,017
SO IT'S BEEN WAR
BETWEEN THE TWO TRIBES.

709
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,185
>> Jeff: SO, STEVE,
PHILLIP IS ASSERTING

710
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,646
THAT THE THE FORMER
ZAPATERA ARE EATING

711
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,690
A LOT MORE RICE
THAN ANYBODY ELSE, TRUE?

712
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,566
>> WELL AS THE MOUTHS STARTED

713
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,985
DISAPPEARING FROM
THE ZAPATERA TRIBE,

714
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,737
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO RATION AS MUCH

715
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,032
SO WE'RE EATING OUR FOOD
THE WAY WE CHOOSE TO.

716
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,202
>> Jeff: ANDREA, THE ZAPATERA
TRIBE IS MAKING THE ARGUMENT

717
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,871
THAT IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
HOW MUCH RICE WE EAT.

718
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:39,540
>> IT IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING
BECAUSE WE WILL LOOK OUT AND

719
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,585
THEY WILL HAVE THIS BOWL FULL
OF RICE FOR THREE OF THEM.

720
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,295
IT JUST SUCKS
BECAUSE WE HAVE MAGGOTS

721
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,089
IN THE BOTTOM OF OUR CONTAINER.

722
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,549
>> PHILLIP WAS BRINGING THIS
INTO A WHOLE RACIAL

723
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,593
BLACK AND WHITE THING
ABOUT THE RICE.

724
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,719
>> Jeff: WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

725
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,263
>> I WAS RELAXED AND YOU WENT
INTO A RACIAL TIRADE

726
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,224
AND BRINGING THE "N" WORD UP
ABOUT YOURSELF.

727
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,852
>> Jeff: WHOA.

728
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,395
WHAT HAPPENED?

729
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,230
>> JEFF, IT GOT UGLY.

730
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,606
HE STARTED THREATENING STEVE.

731
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,857
>> Jeff: HOW SO?

732
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,858
>> HE STARTED THREATENING ME

733
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,944
WITH TAE KWON DO
OR JUJITSU OR SOMETHING.

734
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,112
HE GOES, "WHEN I SNAP, I SNAP."

735
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,240
>> SO HE GOES YOU'RE CRAZY

736
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,908
AND THEN THE "N" WORD CAME OUT.

737
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,535
>> Jeff: WHO BROUGHT UP
THE "N" WORD?

738
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,244
>> PHILLIP BROUGHT UP
THE "N" WORD.

739
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,080
>> I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT HERE.

740
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,582
STEVE LIKES TO CALL ME CRAZY

741
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,751
WHENEVER I BRING
A RATIONAL ARGUMENT,

742
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,253
THIS RICE IS SPOILING,

743
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,254
WE CAN PUT IT ALL
IN THE SAME CAN.

744
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,464
WE CAN'T DO IT.
WHY NOT?

745
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,257
YOU'RE CRAZY, YOU'RE CRAZY,

746
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,259
YOU'RE CRAZY.

747
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,969
HE RESORTS TO CALLING ME CRAZY

748
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,554
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO SAY THE "N" WORD.

749
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,597
HE SAYS CRAZY, CRAZY, CRAZY.

750
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,600
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, YOU'RE SAYING
WHEN STEVE CALLS YOU CRAZY

751
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,394
HE'S SAYING THE "N" WORD.

752
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,979
>> YOU KNOW, RICHARD PRYOR MADE

753
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,731
A MOST FAMOUS COMEDY ALBUM
OF ALL TIME.

754
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,442
YOU KNOW WHAT THE NAME OF IT IS?
"THAT 'N' IS CRAZY."

755
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,986
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES
WHEN WE CONFRONT

756
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,613
CERTAIN TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS,
THAT'S ONE WAY

757
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,282
THAT THEY TRY TO REPRESENT THAT.

758
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,575
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

759
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,327
WHERE YOU'RE MAKING THAT LEAP,
THE CRAZY EQUALS THE "N" WORD

760
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,914
BECAUSE IT'S VERY TRICKY
WHEN YOU HAVE

761
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,707
A WHITE GUY AND A BLACK GUY

762
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,792
TALKING ABOUT RACE
AND THE "N" WORD

763
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,336
BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH AN UGLY
HISTORY TO IT.

764
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,923
>> YOU KNOW, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE A WOMAN?

765
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:11,466
>> Jeff: I DON'T.

766
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,593
>> RIGHT, YOU DON'T.

767
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,303
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN.

768
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,304
>> Jeff: OKAY, PHILLIP--

769
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,305
>> LET ME FINISH.

770
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,389
YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION.

771
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,432
I'M GOING TO GO THERE.

772
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,808
WHEN I WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT

773
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,769
AS A FEDERAL AGENT IN THE
DEPARTMENT THAT WORKED IN

774
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,437
I WAS THE ONLY ONE OF 67.

775
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,606
I CAN'T SUM IT UP
FOR YOU IN WORDS,

776
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,315
BUT I KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.

777
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,942
JUST LIKE A WOMAN KNOWS IT WHEN

778
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,778
A GUY MAKES
AN INAPPROPRIATE REMARK.

779
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,280
SHE CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS BUT
SHE KNOWS SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT

780
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,032
AND I'VE SEEN IT MANY TIMES
IN MY LIFE,

781
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,326
AND THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

782
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,120
>> Jeff: LET ME USE
YOUR SAME LOGIC ON YOU.

783
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,498
YOU'RE SAYING I'M NOT BLACK
SO I DON'T KNOW.

784
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,291
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE MEANS
WHEN HE SAYS "CRAZY?"

785
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,668
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO GET AT.

786
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,213
THERE'S A JUMP IN LOGIC
THAT I NEED THE GAP FILLED.

787
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,883
>> WHEN MY FATHER AND I MOVED TO
UPSTATE NEW YORK

788
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,677
HE AND I WENT
TO THE GROCERY STORE TOGETHER

789
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,221
AND THE MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
SAID TO ME FATHER,

790
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,598
"WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, BOY?"

791
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,349
"YOU TALKING TO ME?"

792
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,391
"YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU.

793
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,393
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, BOY?"

794
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,270
HE DIDN'T USE THE "N" WORD

795
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:10,358
BUT HE TOOK MY FATHER DOWN
TO A VERY LOW LEVEL.

796
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,361
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY--

797
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,988
>> YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT
WHEN I'M FINISHED.

798
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,698
>> I PLAYED 13 YEARS IN THE NFL,

799
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,243
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS
WITH THE LOS ANGELES RAIDERS

800
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,411
WHERE ONE FIFTH
OF THE TEAM WAS WHITE.

801
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:26,249
THERE IS NO LINE OF
BLACK AND WHITE IN MY HEART.

802
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,544
>> Jeff: I'M STARTING
TO GET SOME CLARITY.

803
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,213
IF STEVE SAID, "I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S A CRAZY ARGUMENT.

804
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,422
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE
ANY SENSE TO ME."

805
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,550
YOU WOULD SAY, "THAT'S A GUY

806
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,343
SAYING HE DOESN'T LIKE
MY THOUGHT PROCESS."

807
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,595
BUT WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS,
"YOU'RE CRAZY"

808
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,891
IT'S ALMOST BRINGING UP
EVERY UGLY ASSOCIATION

809
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,853
YOU CAN THINK OF IN ONE WORD.

810
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,354
SO TELL ME IF THIS
IS RIGHT SO FAR.

811
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,190
THERE'S BEEN A BIG DEBATE

812
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,733
BREWING ABOUT LIVING TOGETHER.

813
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,901
IT CULMINATED WITH THE RICE,

814
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,363
AND YOU THREW AN IDEA OUT
THAT YOU FELT WAS REASONABLE.

815
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,364
STEVE SAID, "I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S FIGURE IT OUT.

816
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,408
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT."

817
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,285
AND THEN AS THE ARGUMENT
ABOUT THE RICE CONTINUED,

818
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,620
STEVE MADE A COMMENT THAT SAID,

819
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,497
"I DON'T LIKE IT.
YOU'RE CRAZY."

820
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,207
AT THAT POINT YOU EQUATED THAT

821
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,750
WITH YOU'RE CALLING ME
THE "N" WORD

822
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,294
AND NOW WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW
WORLD WE'RE DEALING WITH.

823
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,421
>> ABSOLUTELY.

824
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,423
>> Jeff: OKAY,
NOW I'M CAUGHT UP.

825
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,424
TWO PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS

826
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,051
HAD AN ARGUMENT.

827
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,303
YOU TOOK IT ONE WAY.

828
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,471
NOBODY CAN QUESTION
THE WAY YOU TOOK IT

829
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,389
AND IT'S BASED
ON YOUR EXPERIENCES

830
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,142
AND THOSE OF PEOPLE
BEFORE YOU.

831
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,310
NOBODY KNOWS STEVE'S INTENTIONS,

832
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,979
OTHER THAN STEVE RIGHT NOW,

833
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:30,897
BECAUSE NOBODY HERE
REALLY KNOWS STEVE.

834
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,899
WE DON'T HAVE ANY BACKGROUND
ON STEVE.

835
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,526
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE BOTH OF YOU
ARE TELLING THE TRUTH.

836
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,945
THAT THAT FELT VERY MUCH LIKE
THE "N" WORD

837
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,114
AND HE ABSOLUTELY
DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.

838
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,115
IS THAT A FAIR ASSESSMENT?

839
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,116
>> SURE.

840
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,117
>> YES.

841
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,118
>> YES.

842
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,620
>> Jeff: SO, ROB, HOW DO YOU

843
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,914
GO FORWARD AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

844
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,665
WHEN ALL OF THIS IS IN THE

845
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,835
CONTEXT OF A MILLION-DOLLAR
PRIZE?

846
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,961
>> NOT EASY.

847
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,088
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT TONIGHT.

848
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,590
IS THIS GOING TO FACTOR IN?

849
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,467
I'M GUESSING MAYBE
ON SOME LEVEL,

850
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,968
CONSCIOUS OR SUBCONSCIOUS.

851
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,678
>> I MEAN, PHILLIP
IS A GROWN MAN.

852
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,304
HE SAYS AND FEELS WHAT HE WANTS.

853
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,472
STEVE IS A GROWN MAN.

854
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,807
HE SAYS AND FEELS WHAT HE WANTS.

855
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,685
I MEAN, IT'S PROBLEMATIC,
BUT IT'S REAL.

856
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,271
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THINGS,

857
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,857
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS

858
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,652
NOT FACTORING INTO OUR DECISION.

859
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,655
>> Jeff: NATALIE, HOW DOES IT
IMPACT THE GAME?

860
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,324
>> IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME
TO SIT HERE AND JUST LISTEN

861
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,494
BECAUSE I FEEL FOR STEVE
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

862
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,330
THAT HE HAS ANY PREJUDICE
IN HIM.

863
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,333
AND THEN I FEEL FOR PHILLIP,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

864
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,503
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN.

865
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,882
>> Jeff: OKAY. LAST QUESTION.

866
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:40,633
SHORTS-- WHERE ARE THEY?

867
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,135
WHO TOOK THEM?
WHO HAS THEM?

868
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:43,678
>> I TOOK THE SHORTS!

869
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,553
>> Jeff: THANK YOU.

870
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,306
>> NOBODY WILL EVER FIND THEM.

871
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,476
I DUG A HOLE AND BURIED THEM
AND A ROCK ON TOP OF THEM.

872
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,355
>> Jeff: IF THIS WERE THERAPY
I WOULD SAY VERY GOOD SESSION.

873
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,900
WE'LL COME BACK WEDNESDAY
AND DO IT AGAIN.

874
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,360
JULIE, IF YOU'RE
A ZAPATERA MEMBER

875
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,947
YOU'RE HOPING FOR A CRACK
IN THE OMETEPE.

876
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,532
MAYBE YOU JUST FOUND IT.

877
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,367
>> YEAH, HOPEFULLY
THEY'RE SEEING

878
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,410
THAT WE WOULD BE A HAPPY FAMILY

879
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,579
IF THERE JUST WASN'T
THIS ONE DIVISION.

880
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,541
>> Jeff: STEVE, CLEARLY,
YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE

881
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,710
BEING LABELED AS A RACIST.

882
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,003
>> YEAH.

883
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,713
>> Jeff: BUT IN A GAME
FOR A MILLION DOLLARS

884
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,548
WOULD YOU BE FINE
IF AS A RESULT

885
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,591
OF THIS ARGUMENT
YOU WERE A PART OF,

886
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,011
PHILLIP GETS VOTED OUT?

887
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,679
>> I WOULD BE HAPPY
BUT NOT CONCERNING

888
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,222
ANY BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE.

889
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,598
WE HAVE THREE VOTES GOING
THAT WAY,

890
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,059
AND HOPING ONE OR TWO OTHERS

891
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,687
MIGHT BE GETTING TIRED
OF HIM AS WE ARE.

892
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,480
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, IF YOU ARE

893
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,858
VOTED OUT TONIGHT
AT THIS MOMENT,

894
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,402
DO YOU BELIEVE IT WOULD
BE BASED ON ANYTHING RACIAL?

895
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,030
>> IF FOR SOME REASON TONIGHT
THEY FELT LIKE

896
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,407
OH, WE NEED TO LET PHILLIP GO
AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

897
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,826
THEN THAT'S THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

898
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,080
>> Jeff: WELL, THIS HAS
DEFINITELY BEEN

899
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,416
A FASCINATING TRIBAL COUNCIL
BECAUSE IT ILLUSTRATES

900
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,419
HOW YOU LIVE TOGETHER
IN A SOCIETY

901
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,172
AND GET ALONG IN A GAME
IN WHICH YOU

902
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,424
THEN HAVE TO VOTE PEOPLE OUT,
SEND THEM TO A JURY,

903
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,552
AND GET THEM TO VOTE FOR YOU
FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.

904
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,473
YOU ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.

905
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,766
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

906
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,933
CANNOT VOTE FOR ROB.

907
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,101
HE HAS THE NECKLACE.

908
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,895
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

909
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,147
STEVE, YOU'RE UP.

910
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,154
>> I HOPE YOU FIND PEACE
IN YOUR HEART SOME DAY, BROTHER.

911
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,699
THERE'S NO PREJUDICE INVOLVED
WITH THE CRAZY COMMENT.

912
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,459
>> IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO

913
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,835
WITH THE COLOR
OF YOUR SKIN, PHIL.

914
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,338
YOU ARE ONE CRAZY DUDE.

915
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:52,681
>> PHILLIP, I HOPE YOU HAVE

916
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,850
A GREAT NIGHT
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND

917
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,812
WITH THE UNDERWEAR
AND YOUR TWO FEATHERS.

918
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,878
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

919
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,847
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL

920
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,558
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

921
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,729
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

922
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,647
PERSON VOTED OUT
WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE

923
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,024
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

924
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,818
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

925
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,864
FIRST VOTE, PHILLIP.

926
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,577
PHILLIP.
TWO VOTES PHILLIP.

927
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,997
PHILLIP.
THREE VOTES PHILLIP.

928
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,252
JULIE.
ONE VOTE JULIE.

929
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,714
JULIE.
THAT'S TWO VOTES JULIE.

930
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,342
JULIE. WE'RE TIED,

931
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,345
THREE VOTES PHILLIP,
THREE VOTES JULIE.

932
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,225
JULIE.
THAT'S FOUR VOTES JULIE.

933
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,686
THREE VOTES PHILLIP.

934
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,897
11th PERSON VOTED OUT OF

935
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,900
"SURVIVOR: REDEMPTION ISLAND,"
JULIE, THAT'S ENOUGH.

936
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,194
>> I GUESS YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO FIND YOUR SHORTS.

937
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,778
>> Jeff: YOU NEED TO BRING ME
YOUR TORCH.

938
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,120
JULIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

939
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,582
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

940
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,293
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND,
GOOD LUCK.

941
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,258
WELL, TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL
IS INDICATIVE

942
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,927
OF HOW THIS GAME
IS GOING TO GO

943
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,303
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.

944
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,763
EVERYTHING YOU SAY,
EVERYTHING YOU DO

945
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,475
MAY HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT
ON WHETHER OR NOT

946
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,727
YOU GET A SHOT AT WINNING
THE MILLION DOLLARS.

947
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,145
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

948
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,313
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

949
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,190
GOOD NIGHT.

950
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,202
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR
SCENES FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

951
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,542
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR.

952
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,627
>> I'M TRULY BLESSED.

953
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,504
>> Jeff: PHILLIP HAS HIS
GREATEST DAY YET.

954
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,421
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING RID

955
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,923
OF THE RIGHT PERSON
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

956
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,383
>> Jeff: WHILE ANDREA COULD BE

957
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,926
SCHEDULED FOR AN EARLY
DEPARTURE.

958
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:34,635
>> I'M JUST SO OVER
THIS GAME, MAN.

959
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,012
>> Jeff: AND MATT PLUMBS TO

960
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,139
THE DARKEST DEPTHS
OF HIS SOUL.

961
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,808
>> I'M OUT HERE WASTING AWAY.

962
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,143
GOD HAS LITERALLY
BEEN CARRYING ME.

963
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,775
>> HERE I AM AT REDEMPTION.

964
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,152
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS.

965
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,446
I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BE STEVE OR RALPH.

966
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,823
BUT I'M OKAY WITH IT.

967
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,825
IT JUST WAS AN UGLY TRIBAL.

968
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,867
THERE'S POISON IN THAT TRIBE,

969
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,703
AND HIS NAME IS PHILLIP.

970
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,248
AND IT'S KIND OF NICE
TO BE REMOVED FROM IT.

971
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,332
AARRGGHHH! DID I SCARE YOU GUYS?
