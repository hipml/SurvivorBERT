00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,293
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously,

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:05,046
on<i> Survivor:</i>
While Rupert went fishing

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,090
for sharks, Jon and Burton
hatched a plot

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,884
with the former Morgans
to vote him out.

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,303
>> The five of us have
to stick together.

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,431
>> PROBST: At the reward
challenge, the tribe played

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,558
in pairs for an afternoon
on a luxury boat.

8
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,686
>> Aw!
>> PROBST: Go!

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,022
Rupert across.
Jon across.

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,275
>> Yes!
>> PROBST: Burton and Lill win

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,610
reward!
Lill kept her reward,

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,487
but Burton gave his away
to Jon.

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,781
>> I didn't want to give
this reward to Rupert because

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,451
I don't want Rupert to have
any more food than he can.

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,245
>> I might not be as secure
as I think I am.

16
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,123
>> PROBST: Before leaving on the
boat, Jon plotted with Burton.

17
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,625
>> As long as the two of us can
get Lill to vote with us...

18
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,627
>> PROBST: But Sandra was
listening in.

19
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,963
Jon is going to work his magic
on Lill the whole boat ride.

20
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,758
>> I'm going to ask her
exactly what he talked about,

21
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,427
and she will tell me.
>> PROBST: On the boat,

22
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,138
Jon and Lill celebrated
with pizza and beer.

23
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,766
>> I am the scoutmaster.
>> You're drunk, Lill.

24
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,351
>> PROBST: And Jon pushed Lill
to vote out Rupert.

25
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,937
>> But I have a lot of guilt.
>> PROBST: Upon her return,

26
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,690
Rupert tried to secure
Lill's loyalty.

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,110
>> I know now Lill will be
wholehearted with me.

28
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,113
>> PROBST: At the immunity
challenge, Burton blew away

29
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,992
the competition.
Burton wins immunity again!

30
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:19,704
Back at camp, Rupert, Christa
and Sandra remained confident

31
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,123
in their control of the tribe.
>> Everybody's agreed upon

32
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,210
Darrah going home.
>> PROBST: But at Tribal Council

33
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,837
they were shocked...
Rupert.

34
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,341
...when Rupert was voted out...
The tribe has spoken.

35
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,177
...and Rupert became the second
member of the jury.

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,349
Seven are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

(thunder rolling)
>> I'm shocked that Rupert

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,260
got voted off tonight.
I can't believe it.

41
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,929
Maybe I've been too cocky
all along, thinking I know

42
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,807
what's going on.
>> Where's that snake mother...

43
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,393
Jon?
I'll tell you what.

44
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,562
Can't nobody trust that bitch
right there.

45
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,439
I never trusted you
from day one,

46
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,566
and you can't be trusted.
Ladies, he cannot be trusted.

47
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,277
He will backstab you in a ...
heartbeat like he did

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,779
everybody here.
>> And what game are

49
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,615
you playing here?
Oh, you're not playing any game.

50
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,116
You're riding on Rupert's
coattails.

51
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,285
Guess what?
That coat just left.

52
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,622
>> Every time a plan went down,
you put it together.

53
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,124
>> I thought tonight's
Tribal Council was probably

54
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,586
one of my proudest moments
in this game thus far.

55
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,422
The one factor that you can
always count on is greed.

56
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,301
The greed of the two Morgan
girls was enough to know

57
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,304
that I could trust them
to, uh... take out Rupert.

58
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,432
>> I hope these three ladies
turn on your ass,

59
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,601
'cause you cannot be trusted.
>> Okay.

60
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,480
>> Who threw the fish out?
>> Not me.

61
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,856
>> Sandra, did you throw
the fish out?

62
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,108
>> No. I'm hungry.
What the ... I'm going

63
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,655
to do with throwing fish out?
Okay, someone threw fish out.

64
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,990
We got back from Tribal
Council, and there was a

65
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,825
bucketful full of fish that
Rupert had caught in the

66
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,494
afternoon.
We go to grab the fish,

67
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,829
and the fish bucket's empty.
Christa, you did it.

68
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,706
>> I didn't, dude.
>> Sandra was talking

69
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,209
the whole time, everyone else...
>> Where is the bucket?

70
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,504
>> The bucket's back here.
They had taken the bucket

71
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,799
of fish, thrown it out, and go,
"I don't know what happened."

72
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,510
Sandra, why are you looking?
You know where they are.

73
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,805
>> How the ... did I know?!
>> Because you probably did it!

74
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,348
You're the one screaming!
>> How the ...!

75
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,850
'Cause I'm screaming at him!
I'm not talking to you!

76
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,851
I was screaming
at that mother ...!

77
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,688
>> You could see Christa
rummage around back there.

78
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,650
>> I didn't take any fish!
I wasn't even in this area.

79
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,860
>> Was I ever here in this area?
>> Yes.

80
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,029
>> Never.
>> No one said anything in this

81
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,740
game to hurt other tribe members
until tonight.

82
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,493
That was the most idiotic,
childish thing I've... I've seen

83
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:50,707
since this game has begun,
and Christa will be penalized.

84
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,502
>> All right. Fine.
I'm going to go to bed.

85
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,630
Now that everybody thinks
that I've tried to devastate

86
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:03,344
the tribe tonight, I think
I stand to be voted off next.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,128
>> I smell the fish, too.
>> Oh, it reeks over by the...

88
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,589
>> Mm-hmm.
>> We'll go get water.

89
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,257
Can you... Will you look
for the fish?

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,926
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Throughout the night,

91
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,220
I was sleeping the closest
to the woods, and I could...

92
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,764
It just reeked of fish,
all night long.

93
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,558
I got up this morning.
I knew the fish were somewhere

94
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,977
behind the camp.
Holy ..., dude!

95
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:59,776
There's a big fish back here.
All the fish.

96
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,779
>> Christa swears
she didn't do it.

97
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:07,283
I think she did it.
She was mad that her good friend

98
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,952
Rupert was gone.
>> You're the only one...

99
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,287
You were the only one
back there!

100
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,997
>> You are the only one
that could have done it!

101
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,999
That's the point!
>> I didn't do it!

102
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,460
>> You're lying, and you have a
reason to lie!

103
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,798
>> I did have about 30 seconds
where I put down my canteen

104
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,343
in the corner of my bed, and
people think, during that time,

105
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,472
I threw out the fish.
I feel horrible for being blamed

106
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,142
and not having any way to prove
that I didn't do it.

107
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,645
>> Listen.
>> I don't even want to hear it.

108
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,146
>> If we're going to share
things, we can't sabotage

109
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,981
the tribe.
>> I don't even want to hear it.

110
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,860
I'm not trying to sabotage...
>> When we got back to camp,

111
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,155
I kept thinking, "You know what?
They're not coming and enjoy

112
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,283
Rupert's fish. Screw that."
So, I got up to camp first,

113
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,453
and I grabbed the bucketful
of fish, and it was so damn

114
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,666
heavy, and I tripped on a vine,
and I spilled all the fish.

115
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,503
And I started arguing with Jon
to the point where it saved me,

116
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,048
because they never pointed the
finger at me as to being the one

117
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,009
dumping the fish.
>> Christa, I saw you behind Jon

118
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,930
in... in the... in the shadows.
Like, I saw your silhouette.

119
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,225
>> Now I'm in a bind.
If I was to tell her,

120
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,228
she'd run off to them,
and there's no doubt in my mind

121
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,356
that I got three days left.
>> (teary): I didn't do it.

122
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,401
And I understand that it looks
like I may have done it, but

123
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:30,158
I didn't do it.
>> I feel very alone.

124
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:35,913
I just want to go home and see
my man, get back to real life.

125
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:47,175
It sucks being here right now.
>> PROBST: Hello, guys.

126
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,052
>> Hi.
>> PROBST: Today's challenge is

127
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,890
based on one of the most brutal
of pirate executions.

128
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,392
Today, six people are gonna walk
the plank.

129
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,604
Jon, appeal to you, the thought
of sending somebody out

130
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,856
into the water?
>> I can't wait to see two

131
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,191
people in particular go
in the ocean.

132
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,234
>> PROBST: Who?
>> Uh, Christa and Sandra.

133
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,904
>> PROBST: Well, today's
challenge is a lot more brutal

134
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,532
than sending Christa
or Sandra out to walk the plank.

135
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,284
Somebody else's gonna
be walking the plank.

136
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:17,079
And the bittersweet of it all
is, these are your loved ones.

137
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,789
(screaming and cheering)
>> PROBST: Sandra, here's

138
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,251
your husband Marcus.
Get on over here, Marcus.

139
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:30,134
Your woman's waiting on you.
>> It's been hard, papi!

140
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,346
I love you, too.
>> PROBST: Get enough

141
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:39,894
to last you, Sandra.
Marcus, take a spot

142
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,314
at the end of the rope.
Welcome to<i> Survivor.</i>

143
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:47,109
T, here's your high school
sweetheart and still great

144
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,446
friend, William.
Get on out here, William!

145
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:57,411
>> Hi, Billy!
Whoo!

146
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:02,291
How are you doing?
>> You look so good.

147
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,668
>> PROBST: Take all the love
you can get, T.

148
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,128
This may be it.
>> All right, let's

149
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,296
kick some butt.
>> We're just gonna

150
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,339
kick ass, girl.
>> All right.

151
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,342
>> PROBST: Burton... somebody
here wants to see you.

152
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:17,306
Here's your mom, Didi.
>> How are you?

153
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,062
>> Good.
>> You're still here.

154
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,648
>> I am still here.
>> Well, you're looking great.

155
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,316
>> PROBST: Didi, you're right
over here.

156
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,946
Lill...
here's your husband, Lonnie.

157
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,574
There you go.
(crying)

158
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,130
>> You're tough, okay, huh?
>> I'm trying. I'm trying.

159
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:53,968
I'm trying.
>> PROBST: Darrah, you're

160
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,928
waiting to see your man.
Here's your boyfriend,

161
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:10,401
Bradley.
>> Oh, Bradley...

162
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,029
(crying)
(sobbing)

163
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,905
>> PROBST: Well, Christa,
here's your fiancé and

164
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:20,745
soon-to-be husband, Pete.
(crying)

165
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:37,053
>> PROBST: Hey, I'm about
to cry. Damn!

166
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,929
>> Oh, my God, we need
to feed you.

167
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,224
>> PROBST: Jon, here's your
buddy, Dan.

168
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,518
I can't wait to meet this guy.
>> Oh, God!

169
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:51,484
>> Whoo!
>> Final... seven?

170
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:20,096
>> You all right, man?
You'll be all right, man.

171
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,227
>> PROBST: Jon, you went from
really happy to really sad.

172
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,105
>> It was either going to be
my buddy or my grandmother

173
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,981
coming, and, uh...
my grandmother's not here

174
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,944
for a reason.
>> PROBST: What happened?

175
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:40,366
>> She's... she's not around.
So...

176
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,494
>> PROBST: Sorry for that news.
I'm sure everybody

177
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,287
here is sorry.
>> I don't know.

178
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,749
I could hope to win this and...
and get some more information.

179
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,807
>> PROBST: All right, guys.
Here's how the challenge is

180
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,642
going to work.
I'm going to ask Survivors

181
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,644
questions about yourselves.
You're going to write down

182
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,813
an answer; your loved ones are
going to write down an answer.

183
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,650
Every time your answers match,
you get to force somebody else's

184
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,487
loved one to take another step
on their plank.

185
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,490
After three steps,
you're out of plank.

186
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,411
The fourth step: in the ocean.
Last one left standing

187
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,081
wins reward.
The reward is: your loved one

188
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,125
gets to come back to camp
with you for 24 hours.

189
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,669
They'll eat with you,
they'll drink,

190
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,380
they'll live in your camp.
For the rest of you,

191
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,215
bye-bye to the loved ones.
All right, loved ones,

192
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,718
get out on your planks.
Survivors, stay where you're at.

193
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,804
We'll get started.
First question:

194
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,308
What is your Survivor's
nickname?

195
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,021
Sandra, reveal your answer.
>> "Changa."

196
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,148
>> PROBST: "Changa."
We have a match.

197
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,484
>> PROBST: T?
>> My mom used to call me this.

198
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,028
My niece used to call me this.
"Tia" or "Aunt Tia."

199
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,364
>> PROBST: Reveal.
>> Oh, "Marissa"! Oh.

200
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,492
>> PROBST: Lill, let's see if
you and Lonnie know each other.

201
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,202
>> "Lill."
>> PROBST: "Lill... Big Lill."

202
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,662
Nice job, Lonnie.
Jon? "Jonny Fairplay."

203
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,414
>> Whoo!
>> PROBST: "Fairplay."

204
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,959
Darrah? "Nub nut."
Bradley, what'd you put?

205
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,004
"D. J." No match.
Burton, let's see what you have.

206
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,673
"Burton."
"Burton" is right.

207
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,092
Christa, you're about
to marry this guy.

208
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,387
How well does he know you?
"Lovie."

209
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,849
Pete says "Lovie."
Another match.

210
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,392
Sandra, first move.
>> Fairplay's buddy.

211
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,102
>> PROBST: Dan,
take one step back.

212
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,730
Lill?
>> I say Sandra.

213
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,274
>> PROBST: Sandra's husband,
Marcus, take a step back.

214
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,944
Jonny Fairplay?
>> I mean, I have about a

215
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,695
million questions I'd like to
know about my grandmother,

216
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,114
but obviously, some people don't
give a... so Sandra's husband.

217
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,824
>> It's not all about you
all the time.

218
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,244
>> Right.
>> His grandmother just died.

219
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,620
>> Sandra's husband is
my choice.

220
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,414
>> PROBST: Marcus...
take a second step.

221
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,958
Burton?
>> T's boy.

222
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,918
>> PROBST: William, take a step
back onto the green.

223
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,586
Christa, who's walking
the plank?

224
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,422
>> Burton's mom.
>> PROBST: No love

225
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,758
for the mother.
Next question: relating to the

226
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:08,305
Survivors: What is their
favorite home-cooked meal?

227
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,144
Sandra, what's your favorite
home-cooked meal?

228
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,980
I can't even pronounce that.
>> It's<i> arroz con gandules,</i>

229
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,606
rice with beans.
>> PROBST: "Rice and beans."

230
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,775
"Rice and beans."
That's a match.

231
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:24,738
T? "Mashed potatoes, chicken."
>> Oh, Grandma J's mac n cheese!

232
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,367
>> PROBST: Lill?
>> Spaghetti.

233
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,661
>> PROBST: Look at that.
"Spaghetti."

234
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,788
Jonny Fairplay?
>> Going with my favorite meal

235
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,164
of all.
>> PROBST: "Steak."

236
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,333
"New York steak." Wow.
Darrah?

237
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,795
"Meat & potatoes."
(Darrah laughs)

238
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:43,257
Bradley? No match.
Burton? "Steak."

239
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,427
"Steak."
Another match.

240
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,470
All right, Christa?
"Roast chicken."

241
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,932
Wow. "Roasted chicken."
Absolute match.

242
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,351
Okay. Sandra?
>> Lill's husband.

243
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,604
>> PROBST: Lonnie, take a step
back on your plank,

244
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,521
into the green.
Lill?

245
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,815
>> I'm sorry, Sandra.
It's got to be Sandra.

246
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,818
>> PROBST: Marcus,
one more step.

247
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,486
You are one step away
from shark bait, brother.

248
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,197
Jonny Fairplay?
>> I got to send him back.

249
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,824
Marcus?
>> You're going down,

250
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:09,992
he's saying.
>> PROBST: Marcus, say good-bye

251
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,493
to your woman.
This is the last time

252
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,954
you're going to see her.
>> I love you, baby.

253
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,332
>> PROBST: First person to walk
the plank: Sandra's husband.

254
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,711
>> I love you.
It's all good.

255
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,129
>> PROBST: Burton, who's walking
the plank?

256
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,214
>> Christa.
>> PROBST: Christa's fiancé,

257
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,385
take a step back.
Christa, payback time.

258
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,638
>> Bradley.
>> PROBST: Bradley, take a step

259
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,181
back, onto the green.
Everybody even up

260
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,517
on their planks now.
>> This is brutal. This sucks.

261
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,562
>> PROBST: Next round:
If your Survivor could do

262
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,023
anything in the world for a
living, what would

263
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,235
that dream job be?
Darrah?

264
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,613
"Modeling."
Bradley?

265
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,365
>> He got it wrong.
>> PROBST: A nurse.

266
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,824
>> Gosh!
>> PROBST: No match.

267
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,993
>> We're going to have
to talk when we get home.

268
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,828
>> PROBST: Lill, who's walking
the plank?

269
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,706
>> I want her to forgive me.
It's got to be Christa.

270
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,750
>> PROBST: Christa's fiancé,
Pete, that's it for you.

271
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:08,050
Say good-bye to your woman.
Next question: What is the one

272
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,387
personality trait
that could cost your Survivor

273
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:22,856
to lose this game?
Who's walking the plank?

274
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,775
>> Bradley.
>> PROBST: Bradley,

275
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:34,785
say good-bye to your woman.
What is your loved one's

276
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:39,540
favorite genre of music?
All right, Lill sends in Didi.

277
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,917
Didi, say your good-byes
to your son.

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,211
>> I'm so sorry.
>> PROBST: You look so elegant.

279
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,796
>> Bye, Burton.
>> Bye.

280
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,256
>> Good to see you.
See you soon.

281
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,552
>> PROBST: You have a great son.
>> Oh...

282
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,721
>> PROBST: Jonny Fairplay?
>> Uh, he did... I got to

283
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,932
go after T's man, Billy.
>> Hey, may condolences, man.

284
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:02,229
>> Thank you.
>> Cannonball.

285
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,605
(laughing)
>> That was awesome.

286
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,942
>> PROBST: A cannonball.
>> That's Billy.

287
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,945
>> PROBST: Well, comes down
to this.

288
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:13,115
Burton, big decision for you.
If you choose Lonnie,

289
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,952
Jonny Fairplay gets his buddy.
If you choose Dan,

290
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:21,123
we go to another question.
>> I'm going to have to go

291
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,624
with Lonnie.
I'm sorry, man.

292
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,878
You've got an amazing wife.
>> PROBST: Why Lonnie?

293
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,630
Um, because Jon's news is...
I mean, it's the worst day

294
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,299
of his life.
I've got to let him

295
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,800
hear it through.
>> Got to.

296
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,510
>> We all support that.
>> PROBST: Lill,

297
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,512
you understand that?
>> Man, I understand that.

298
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,139
It's just been so good
just seeing him.

299
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,641
>> We'll take care of Lill,
Lonnie; we promise.

300
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,310
Have a good dip.
>> Come on, Big Lonnie!

301
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:49,318
Show 'em what you got, baby!
>> Thank you, guys.

302
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,320
Thank you so much, guys.
>> Thank you.

303
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:57,159
>> Of course. Of course.
>> I'm sorry, guys.

304
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,660
I'm so sorry.
>> Don't be sorry.

305
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,162
>> It's okay.
>> PROBST: Jonny, come on over

306
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,164
and say hello.
>> PROBST: Dan, get off that.

307
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,875
>> Whoo!
(crying and laughing)

308
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,173
>> Jon's lost about 30 pounds,
so take it easy on him.

309
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,510
>> I thought he gained ten.
(laughter)

310
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,346
>> PROBST: Okay.
As I said, Jon...

311
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,224
>> I'm so happy right now.
>> PROBST: Your buddy Dan is

312
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,851
coming back to camp with you.
You're going to share in

313
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,812
everything about that camp--
eat their food,

314
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,481
drink their water,
because it is your camp

315
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:31,360
and your camp only tonight.
For 24 hours, the two of you

316
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,862
are going to be on Camp Balboa.
For you guys,

317
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,240
you generously gave up
a chance to spend time

318
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,991
with your loved ones
so that Jon could get

319
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,077
a little more information
about his grandma.

320
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,663
So, we're going to give him
an opportunity to do that.

321
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,874
You're going to another beach.
Let's see what you've learned

322
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,251
after 28 days out here.
>> Oh, my gosh.

323
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,877
>> PROBST: Burton, come over
and get this machete.

324
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,295
>> Does this mean
we have to start over?

325
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,005
>> PROBST: Here's some
waterproof matches.

326
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,175
You're going to a separate beach
tonight for 24 hours

327
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,179
with a machete and some matches.
Great challenge.

328
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,557
Lots to think about.
>> I love you, baby.

329
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,225
>> I love you, guys.
Thank you, every single

330
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,560
one of you.
>> Thank you.

331
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,894
>> What's your name?
>> Thunder D.

332
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,896
>> This is Thunder D, guys.
>> Whoo!

333
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,567
>> Thunder D's the greatest guy
in the world.

334
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:50,606
>> Home sweet home.
>> Jon and his friend

335
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,817
are now at our home.
They have, um, free rein of our

336
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,070
shelter and whatever food was
there, and we are now put on

337
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:01,658
another beach with no food
and no shelter.

338
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,078
We're definitely struggling.
Um, we're starving.

339
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,164
Uh, we found one coconut.
Whoo-hoo!

340
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:12,836
>> Oh, God! So bad.
It's just not a good situation.

341
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,424
>> Jon's grandmother
just passed away.

342
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:21,470
We all kind of agreed that,
"Hey, let's let Jon take this."

343
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:26,725
Our mothers, our husbands,
wives, uh, boyfriends, whatever,

344
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:31,772
will be there when we get home.
>> I wish I could see him and

345
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,649
just talk to him a few more
minutes.

346
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:39,321
But then, Jon got his news
about his grandmother.

347
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,324
I've gotten to know Jon.
He hurts just as much

348
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,701
as anyone.
My husband has to understand

349
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:50,165
that this is what we had to do
for him to have some time

350
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,920
to talk over his grandmother's
death with his friend.

351
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,974
>> Oh, man.
>> That was a brilliant

352
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,517
performance, sir.
>> Like that?

353
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,018
>> Yeah, thank you.
Did you like mine?

354
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,187
>> I couldn't cry. I tried.
I thought I brought on

355
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,356
a couple tears for you.
>> It was sweat.

356
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,693
My grandmother's sitting home
watching<i> Jerry Springer</i>

357
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,697
right now.
So, there's my autograph

358
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,574
right in the center.
There it is, the snake.

359
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,368
This is a game
for a million dollars.

360
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,495
I have one chance
in my life at this.

361
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,831
You should take every
single advantage possible.

362
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,209
If you don't, you're a fool.
So, yeah, I'm final two,

363
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,711
by the way.
Did I mention that?

364
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,588
Yeah, final two.
That's... (laughs)

365
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,216
Thank you. Thank you.
I haven't even come close

366
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,885
to being voted off, dude.
>> Jon called me before he left

367
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,596
and was like, "I've got to have
any sort of leverage

368
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,890
I possibly can."
He said,

369
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,226
"Outsmart and outthink."
He's got to outplay everybody.

370
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,395
And he was like,
"If you come down here,

371
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,897
tell me my grandma died."
Oh, man, They're going

372
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,566
to kill you.
>> I know.

373
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,027
You know, you notice how
everyone gave up their ...

374
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,237
for me?
>> I-I-I shed a tear for you.

375
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,533
>> The fake dead grandmother
could easily go down

376
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,578
as the dirtiest thing ever
to be done in this game.

377
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,747
>> Isn't it crazy?
>> You're going out, man, once

378
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,624
they hear what's going on, dude.
(laughs): You're grandma's

379
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,418
going to hate you.
>> My grandma's going

380
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:26,470
to love it.
>> That's them.

381
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:37,814
to love it.
>> That's them.

382
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,692
You want to walk over?
>> Yeah.

383
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:47,449
Well, back to the game
you go, my man.

384
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:54,039
Ten days, man. Ten days.
>> Hey, hey!

385
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,458
>> What's up, dude?
>> Dan doesn't like it here.

386
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,752
>> You didn't love our home,
Thunder D?

387
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,506
I like mine better, but...
You guys all right

388
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,927
somewhere else?
>> No.

389
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,512
>> Depends on your definition of
"all right."

390
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,013
>> It sucked.
>> All right,

391
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,808
I'll walk you over.
>> All right.

392
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,394
Well, nice meeting you guys.
>> Nice meeting you, too.

393
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,313
>> Take care.
>> Bye.

394
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:33,620
>> Thanks, man.
>> Me and Christa have been

395
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,540
looking for ways to just put
stuff in Tijuana's head,

396
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:40,168
because right now we feel like
Tijuana has the power

397
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,547
to make a move either
against us or with us.

398
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,716
My only hope is for them to
realize that they cannot trust

399
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,970
Jon and Burton.
Jon used to always say that

400
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,014
Christa was the strongest female
on both tribes.

401
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,892
That's why, if Christa goes...
That's why Christa's going.

402
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,519
>> Right.
>> Darrah's going before, 'cause

403
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,230
they don't worry about Darrah.
>> Right.

404
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,817
>> They know you're physical and
you might be Jon's competition.

405
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,153
As strong as Burton is,
I wouldn't doubt if that ...

406
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,654
is going to win all these
immunities.

407
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:11,324
If you don't watch your back,
it's going to be those three

408
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,703
against just you two.
He's a force to reckon with.

409
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,415
And Tijuana just looked at us
and just listened to the whole

410
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:22,210
thing, and she didn't comment
on anything.

411
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:31,178
>> Well, let's go for a walk.
>> Burton and Jon decided

412
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,223
to go off on a walk.
And a lot of the times,

413
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,893
I sneak up, just to hear
what's going on.

414
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,561
That's how I always
have a working knowledge

415
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,521
of what's going on,
what's going to happen next.

416
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,857
>> I'm like, "I'm trying
to help you here..."

417
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,068
>> And this time, when I saw
them getting ready to go, I went

418
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,530
over to Tijuana and I said,
"You got to come with me now."

419
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,533
She's like, "I want you to hear
what I think is going on

420
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:58,163
and, um, you can be the judge
versus listening to me."

421
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,215
>> I hope it will go
smoothly tomorrow.

422
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,468
>> I'm not majorly concerned.
>> I just want it to be the two

423
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,721
of us in the final two.
And then, when the time is

424
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,431
right, we'll talk to Lill
about the top three.

425
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,267
>> I thought I heard something
along the lines

426
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,479
of "Lill, Burton and Jon,
an alliance of three."

427
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:26,524
>> I mean, if we just guarantee
those two girls top five,

428
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,610
which we have done,
and then, you're guaranteeing

429
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,864
T all the way...
Final two.

430
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,324
Then they've got to vote with us
tomorrow.

431
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,118
>> Well, I think it should be
no problem.

432
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,121
>> The timing was perfect.
It was better for her to hear

433
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,958
with her own ears coming out of
their mouths than for me to put

434
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,751
things in her head
and for her to have doubts.

435
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,630
There's no doubts now.
>> I'm not worried about you.

436
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,924
I'm not worried about me.
>> So... I'm not worried

437
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,261
about Lill, actually.
>> You keep working T.

438
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,971
It sounds like you got
a good connection there.

439
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,515
>> Uh-huh.
>> I'm going to talk to D.

440
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,518
>> It just kind of let me
refocus on how to play

441
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,686
this game.
It's given me a... I think,

442
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,606
a heads up on things and how I
would like to play the game.

443
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,945
So, thereafter, I told Darrah
everything that I heard

444
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,614
and I let her know that
we need to regroup.

445
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,783
We need to have a different
plan, because our alliance

446
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,411
is going to be kicking us out,
most likely, fourth and fifth.

447
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:50,692
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Let's get to today's

448
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,193
immunity challenge.
First things first.

449
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,657
Burton.
There you go.

450
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,414
Immunity, back up for grabs.
All right, you been out here

451
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,999
30 days.
You're tired, you're hungry,

452
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:10,003
not sleeping.
One of the hardest things to do

453
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,588
in this situation is
think clearly.

454
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,174
Today's challenge is going
to test just that.

455
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,593
It is a word scramble.
Here's how it works.

456
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:20,430
On your board are three words.
You will use the letters

457
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,558
from these three words
to form 20 new words:

458
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,395
three three-letter words,
four four-letter words,

459
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,398
five five-letter words,
six six-letter words,

460
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,861
and two words
that are seven letters or more.

461
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,905
Here are the rules.
Words must be English.

462
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,241
No plurals.
No personal or proper names.

463
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,286
No names of cities or states.
When you think you've completed

464
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,248
the word puzzle, yell out,
"I'm done," game stops.

465
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,084
I'll check your board.
If you're right,

466
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,960
you win immunity.
If you're wrong,

467
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,755
you're out of the game.
Take a spot at your board,

468
00:27:53,838 --> 00:28:00,970
wait for my go.
Here we go, guys, for immunity.

469
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:05,225
Survivors, ready?
Go!

470
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,143
You're using all the letters
to form new words.

471
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,272
And in case you're wondering,
"survivor," "pearl," "islands"

472
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,983
cannot be any of your words.
Christa on a tear,

473
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:24,077
ripping through this board.
>> Stop.

474
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:38,758
ripping through this board.
>> Stop.

475
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,469
>> PROBST: Everybody stop,
turn around.

476
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,848
Christa's made her call,
thinks she's finished her board.

477
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,814
Board's wrong.
This word right here, "er"

478
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,816
not "ar."
You're out of the game,

479
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,154
have a seat.
Everybody else, resume.

480
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,490
>> Got it.
Everybody stop.

481
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,492
Turn around.
T's called it.

482
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:10,874
Check T's board.
No plurals.

483
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,459
T, you're out of the game.
Have a seat.

484
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:19,340
Everybody resume.
Christa's out, T is out.

485
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,386
>> Got it.
>> PROBST: Everybody stop,

486
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,682
turn around.
Jon has called it.

487
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,727
This word here-- misspelled.
Jon's out of the game.

488
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,522
Have a seat with the girls.
Everybody resume.

489
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:41,112
Down to Lill, Burton,
Darrah and Sandra.

490
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,994
>> Done.
>> PROBST: Everybody turn

491
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,871
around.
Burton's called it.

492
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:58,713
Check his board.
Burton wins immunity!

493
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:04,052
Nicely done.
>> Thank you.

494
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:10,058
>> PROBST: Burton, come on over.
>> Mother...

495
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,852
>> PROBST: Once again, you're
safe from tonight's vote.

496
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:17,023
Everybody else, very vulnerable
at tonight's Tribal Council.

497
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,400
Gather your stuff and head on
back to camp.

498
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:33,748
I'll see you guys tonight.
Yo! Survivors, come back!

499
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:37,794
Huddle up right in here.
You guys headed out.

500
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,587
I know I've already
given you immunity.

501
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,923
Do you see what word I'm
looking at that's wrong?

502
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:47,095
I didn't catch it.
"Liaison" has another "I".

503
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:51,933
L-i-a-i... s-o-n.
That, I'm sorry...

504
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,936
is not yours.
So, here's what we're gonna do.

505
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,230
Unfortunately,
when you guys left,

506
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,440
everybody walked through, you
looked at each other's boards

507
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,110
you probably started talking
about words you had.

508
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,279
This game is done.
You're now out, Burton.

509
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,739
Christa, you're still out.
T, you're still out.

510
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,577
Jon, you're still out.
Sandra, Darrah, and Lill

511
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,121
are still in the game.
It's a new game.

512
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,872
I'm gonna give you
three new words,

513
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,667
and it's a timed trial.
You'll have one minute to come

514
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,462
up with words that are either
four letters or more in length.

515
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,922
I'm gonna add up
how many words are right.

516
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,466
Person with the most wins
immunity.

517
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,260
Are you guys good with this?
>> This is good.

518
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,137
>> PROBST: It's fair?
>> Fair.

519
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,264
>> PROBST: Okay, so, the four
that are out, take a

520
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,474
seat back where you were.
The other three, take

521
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,143
your spots at your board.
Immunity...

522
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:39,606
it's back up for grabs.
Here we go, guys-- for the first

523
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,692
time, a woman will be
wearing immunity.

524
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:47,488
Survivors ready?
Go.

525
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,991
Same rules apply.
No plurals, proper names,

526
00:31:50,074 --> 00:32:00,084
cities, states.
Five, four,

527
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:11,054
cities, states.
Five, four,

528
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:15,516
three, two, one.
Everybody step away

529
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:29,322
from your board.
Lill has ten right.

530
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:36,913
Darrah has 14 right.
Sandra has 12 right.

531
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,915
Not enough.
Darrah wins immunity. Nice job.

532
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,584
>> You go, girl.
(cheering)

533
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,711
>> Anybody but him.
>> PROBST: Darrah,

534
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,422
get over here.
First woman to wear this.

535
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:53,846
Turn around and put this on.
I misspoke earlier.

536
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,099
<i>You</i> are the only person safe
at tonight's Tribal Council.

537
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,560
Everybody else, vulnerable.
Head on back to camp.

538
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:09,612
So long, guys.
>> We've got Tribal Council

539
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:24,085
So long, guys.
>> We've got Tribal Council

540
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,463
tonight, and, uh, ironically,
the strongest player

541
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,592
has now lost the chance
for immunity.

542
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,429
So, we'll really sway votes.
We'll either support having

543
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,557
the strongest player leave
or we will support the two

544
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,769
most antagonist players
in the game leave.

545
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,147
This is a perfect opportunity to
get rid of the strongest player.

546
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,107
>> It's the only opportunity.
>> The only opportunity.

547
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,526
>> And then I don't know who
should be our next after that.

548
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,445
>> I would think that Christa
would be the next to go.

549
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,571
Hey, we gave her three extra
days.

550
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:55,450
Jon, he's not clueless.
He knows that it's a pretty good

551
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,951
chance that Burton's going
to go out.

552
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,162
He has no other option
but to be on our side.

553
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,788
>> Right.
>> Well, let's get rid

554
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,874
of Burton first.
>> Mm-hmm.

555
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,209
>> And then we'll move
to plan number two.

556
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,295
>> Right.
>> Okay?

557
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,798
But for right now, the objective
is for Burton to go home,

558
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:15,470
so he can be crushed tonight.
Just like Rupert was crushed,

559
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,097
he'll be crushed.
>> I understand the decision,

560
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,309
but, you know, I prefer Christa.
But I understand why.

561
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,394
>> Right and because you got
majority, you have to go

562
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,313
majority or it's...
your butt's on the line.

563
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,440
>> Exactly.
>> All right, cool.

564
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,692
>> It's a huge deal that-that
Burton's under the microscope

565
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,153
right now.
Burton's someone that I want

566
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,655
here for a while, 'cause he's
one of, uh, my best allies.

567
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,949
So, I thought it was
crazy to get rid of him.

568
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:41,329
So, I got to just roll the dice.
I don't think he deserves to go

569
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,957
anywhere and I'd rather keep
Burton and keep eating.

570
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,502
You guys owe me nothing.
You guys owe me a big ...

571
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,378
finger to the face.
>> What'd she say to you?

572
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,005
>> She wants Burton
to go home tonight.

573
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:54,008
In exchange for my vote, she-she
promises you on a ...

574
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:58,387
silver platter.
She ... hates your guts.

575
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,516
>> And if Burton doesn't go,
then who do you want to go?

576
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,643
>> I want T to go.
I don't think she ...

577
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,353
deserves it.
She pissed me off.

578
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,188
>> And what would you do
with Lill and Darrah?

579
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,357
>> I'm scared. I'm scared
to make a move with you.

580
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,067
>> I understand. I understand...
>> I'm so ... scared.

581
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,361
You just don't know.
Would you promise us four?

582
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,822
Would you get rid of Lill?
>> I'll, I'll get rid of Lill.

583
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,824
>> Jon comes out and says,
"We want to fix things

584
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,202
between you guys again.
I want you to help me

585
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,330
save Burton today
in exchange for Tijuana."

586
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,581
And we're like,
"Well, we're listening,

587
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,209
but you have done us wrong
so many times before."

588
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,586
>> All right, look.
If we go final four,

589
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,881
us four, that's fair.
Is that not fair?

590
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,967
>> Jon, you just don't know
how much we distrust you.

591
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,844
>> I swear on...
I-I swear on my grandmother.

592
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:42,223
That-that's a big freakin' deal.
And I wouldn't break that.

593
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,286
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
the members of our jury,

594
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:08,332
Ryan and Rupert, voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

595
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:15,047
30 days you guys have lasted.
30 days.

596
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,925
First question:
T, what is going on

597
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,386
with this tribe right now?
>> There's chaos.

598
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:23,890
There's... just a lot going on.
>> PROBST: Sandra, where is

599
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,934
this tribe?
>> Um, after the last Tribal

600
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,604
Council, we went straight to
camp and there was so much

601
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,732
shouting, fighting, cursing,
I mean, the works.

602
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,109
All of a sudden,
they're looking for the fish to

603
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,445
fire it up and have a good meal,
and somebody tossed

604
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,530
the fish in the jungle.
And they start pointing

605
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,575
the finger at Christa
'cause she put her water canteen

606
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,410
under the shelter.
We were all hungry, we wanted

607
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,747
to eat Rupert's fish,
but nobody ate jack.

608
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,957
>> PROBST: So, Christa, you're
still taking the blame for this.

609
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,752
>> I-I was gone for 30 seconds.
I didn't do it.

610
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:57,256
I don't know who did it.
I-I can't prove anything.

611
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,383
>> PROBST: Let's talk about
the reward challenge where you

612
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,971
got to see your loved ones.
Christa, that had

613
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,433
to warm your heart.
>> It gave me so much energy

614
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:14,315
and hope right when I needed it.
Made me so happy.

615
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,651
>> PROBST: Then Jon shares some
information with us that,

616
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,611
lo and behold,
his grandmother's passed away.

617
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,822
And we have this sudden change
of events again in which you

618
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,825
guys decide to let Jon win
so that he can be

619
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,954
with his friend.
Did you get the information

620
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,455
you wanted?
>> Yeah.

621
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,457
Definitely one of the saddest
days of my entire life.

622
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,628
But I have to say, uh,
it-it really meant a lot to me,

623
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,047
uh, for everyone to-to
come together like that

624
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,050
for-for me, and, uh...
I'll never be able

625
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,511
to thank them enough for that.
>> PROBST: T, is this tribe

626
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,055
closer as a result of everything
that happened the last

627
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,015
three days?
>> I think, for the moment,

628
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,686
um, at least for myself,
the game no longer mattered

629
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,021
to me.
It was about Jon and him needing

630
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,524
information to live outside
of this game.

631
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,152
After that, it went back to the
game, and after that, we are now

632
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,155
still... there's a lot of
tension between, um, some of us.

633
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,867
And, um, it's-it's-it's...
it's definitely chaos.

634
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,537
>> PROBST: Burton, who do you
trust in this game?

635
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,081
>> I would like to think
I could trust a lot of people.

636
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,084
But you don't have to trust
someone to have an alliance

637
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,627
with them.
You just have to have

638
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,504
the same interests.
You could hate someone's guts,

639
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,715
but if you could help them get
farther and they could

640
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,217
help you go farther,
hey, we've got an alliance.

641
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,428
>> PROBST: You know, after 30
days, you form relationships

642
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,097
with people.
And, obviously, it's hard to

643
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,558
trust people because it's a
game, but at a certain point,

644
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,394
Jon, are you willing to betray
anybody in this game

645
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,897
to get what you want?
>> Several days ago, yes.

646
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,401
At this point, I don't think so.
>> PROBST: Why the change

647
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,278
of heart?
>> I-I've had a...

648
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:47,074
I've had a rough few days, man.
I mean, I'll be honest with you,

649
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,535
you know, uh...
priorities changed a little bit.

650
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,787
You know?
>> PROBST: Darrah, you have

651
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,582
immunity.
I'm sure it feels good.

652
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,584
It is yours to give away
if you'd like to.

653
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,587
Is there anybody you want
to give that up to?

654
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,589
Darrah is the only person
you cannot vote for.

655
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,591
Everybody else is fair game.
It's time to vote.

656
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:13,684
Sandra, you're up.
>> Burton, I'm voting for you

657
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:21,442
Sandra, you're up.
>> Burton, I'm voting for you

658
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:26,906
only because you're the biggest
threat we have right now.

659
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,292
>> T, I know it's your birthday
tomorrow, and I don't think

660
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,671
one of us is going to be here
to see it.

661
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,390
>> Burton, I heard you and Jon
talking and you had a lot of

662
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,518
differences in what you were
telling us versus

663
00:39:55,601 --> 00:40:05,611
what you told Jon.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally

664
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:14,036
what you told Jon.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally

665
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:27,675
the votes.
Once the votes are read,

666
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,136
the decision is final.
The person voted out will be

667
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,513
asked to leave the
Tribal Council area immediately.

668
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:40,312
I'll read the votes.
First vote:

669
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:48,445
Burton.
Tijuana.

670
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,952
Burton.
That's two votes Burton.

671
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,584
Tijuana.
A happy birthday.

672
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,670
That's two votes T,
two votes Burton.

673
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,343
T. Three votes T,
two votes Burton.

674
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:19,018
Tenth person voted out
of the tribe: T.

675
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,061
You need to bring me your torch.
That's four votes.

676
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,149
That's enough.
Last vote will remain a mystery.

677
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:40,039
T, the tribe has spoken.
Burton said it best.

678
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:50,090
T, the tribe has spoken.
Burton said it best.

679
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,676
It's not about trust anymore.
It's about mutually

680
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,223
beneficial interests.
You guys can head back to camp.

681
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,225
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i> A few lucky tribe
mates experience the ultimate

687
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,626
getaway.
And a shift in power begins...

688
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,753
>> I want the guys to go.
>> Yeah, yeah.

689
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,089
>> You think that'll work?
>> PROBST: ...while old

690
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,924
alliances crumble.
>> Are you still thinking

691
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,759
that we're the final two?
>> I don't want to think

692
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,636
that far in advance.
>> You're telling me, now,

693
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:44,311
that you've had second thoughts.
>> Well, it looks like, um, I

694
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,523
think I tried to make some
decisions in this game and to

695
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,484
try to make things work to my
advantage and take that

696
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:53,988
leadership role, I think, cost
me the game.

697
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,323
And for the rest of the tribe
members in the game,

698
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,450
I have no animosity
to any of them.

699
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,536
Um, I've made it to the jury.
I'm proud of myself.

700
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,705
So, with that being said, peace.
