00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:04,337
LAST WEEK ON

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:04,879
"SURVIVOR": WE ARE MERGED.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,507
AFTER THE TRIBES MERGE, THE

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,133
RETURNING PLAYERS AND LOVED ONES

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,968
WERE FINALLY REUNITED.

6
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,220
>> THIS IS WHERE "SURVIVOR"

7
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,431
REALLY BECOME "SURVIVOR."

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,765
>> Jeff: BACK AT CAMP, TYSON

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,308
FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

10
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,226
>> I'M DEFINITELY NOT SHARING

11
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,687
THIS WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

12
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,229
>> Jeff: AND TWO PAIRS OF

13
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:26,359
LOVED ONE, ARAS AND VYTAS, AND

14
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,235
TINA AND KATIE THOUGHT THEY WERE

15
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,446
SITTING PERFECT.

16
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,405
>>.

17
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,906
BUT THAT WAS FAR FROM THE TRUTH.

18
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,282
>> YOU'RE WITH US.

19
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,201
WOO TAKE ARAS OUT FIRST.

20
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,913
>> Jeff: EXPAT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

21
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,125
ARAS WAS THE VICTIM OF A VIRS

22
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,001
BLINDSIDE.

23
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,544
>> ARAS, YOU NEED TO BRING ME

24
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:44,836
YOUR TORCH.

25
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,839
>> WELL PLAYED, GUYS, WELL

26
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,089
PLAYED.

27
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,591
>> Jeff: ARAS, THE TRIBE HAS

28
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:49,799
SPOKEN.

29
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,467
10 ARE LEFT.

30
00:00:50,550 --> 00:01:00,727
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

31
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,395
>> WELL, YOU GUYS, THAT WAS A

32
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,229
GREAT MOVE.

33
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,732
AS A FAN OF THE SHOCK, ARAS DID

34
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,776
NOT SEE THAT COMING, MAN,

35
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,693
NEITHER DID I.

36
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,652
SO CONGRATULATIONS.

37
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,195
THAT WAS AWESOME.

38
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,322
IT SUCKS TO SEE MY BRO GO,

39
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,114
THOUGH, I WILL SAY THAT.

40
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,992
>> I LOVED ARAS, TOO, WE ALL

41
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:16,159
DID.

42
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,202
>> HEY, HEY, IT'S THE GAME, MAN.

43
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,622
>> ARAS MYSELF AND TINA AND

44
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,208
KATIE GOT COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED.

45
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,417
VENGEANCE IS GOING TO BE MINE AT

46
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:24,709
SOME POINT.

47
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,086
KNIVES OUT, BRO.

48
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,505
LET'S GET IT ON AND I WILL SEE

49
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,881
HOW BAD I CAN GET YOU.

50
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,342
>> WELL, I CAN'T KEEP MY MOUTH

51
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:32,842
SHUT.

52
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,260
SO I'VE GOTTA SAY SOMETHING.

53
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,845
BRAVO TO YOU.

54
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,099
THAT WAS A GREAT MOVE.

55
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,226
MONICA AND TYSON, YOU WON THE

56
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:41,476
BATTLE.

57
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,144
BUT YOU DIDN'T WIN THE WAR.

58
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,980
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT FIVE JURY

59
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,149
VOTES THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET FOR

60
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,567
FLIPPING.

61
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:49,776
AND--

62
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,568
>> TINA?

63
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,694
>> WHAT?

64
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,906
>> YOU, KATIE, AND VETEAS PUSHED

65
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,156
US OUT.

66
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,325
>> I DIDN'T PUSH ANYBODY OUT.

67
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,910
>> WELL, THAT WAS ARAS' PLAN.

68
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,245
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS

69
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:00,829
HIS PLAN.

70
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,205
BUT THE THING IS, THAT YOU ALL

71
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,915
WERE NEVER IN THE ALLIANCE.

72
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,374
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

73
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,376
I HAD AN ALLIANCE WITH ARAS.

74
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,711
>> HAD AN ALLIANCE WITH ARASA

75
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:08,878
WELL.

76
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,421
>> WE ALL DID, TINA.

77
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,257
>> EVERY PERSON?

78
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,549
EVERYBODY?

79
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:12,882
>> YES, FIVE.

80
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,342
>> THAT'S THE CRAZIEST PART,

81
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:14,551
TINA--

82
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
>> LOOK, WE ALL FELT LIKE WE

83
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,971
WERE HIS TOP THREE.

84
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,055
THERE WAS ONE PERSON THAT WAS

85
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,557
FLIPPING ON EVERYBODY, AND HE'S

86
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,474
OUT OF THE GAME RIGHT NOW.

87
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,141
>> UNDERSTAND THAT.

88
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:22,725
>> AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

89
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:22,934
THAT.

90
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,893
>> I UNDERSTAND.

91
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,436
>> BECAUSE YOU ACCUSED ME OF

92
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,355
SOMETHING I AM NOT GUILTY OF.

93
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,524
"SURVIVOR'S" BROKEN MY HEART

94
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,441
TWICE, AND I THINK TONIGHT I

95
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,442
FELL BACK IN LOVE.

96
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,944
I KNEW ARAS WASN'T GOING TO TAKE

97
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,363
ME TO THE END, AND I KNEW TINA

98
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,073
HAD PRIORITIZED KATY IN FRONT OF

99
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,491
ME, SO FOR HER TO COME OUT AND

100
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,285
SAY, "YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF

101
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,286
YOURSELF BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE

102
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,955
WAY I PLAY THE GAME," OOIK LIME,

103
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,540
"TINA, IF EVERYONE PLAYED THE

104
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,167
GAME YOU DO, I WOULD WIN 100% OF

105
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:53,256
THE TIME."

106
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,299
>> NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR THE HOME

107
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,217
TEAM, AND I REALLY AM SORRY.

108
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,386
THE THING SI CHOSE WHICH

109
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,305
ALLIANCE I WAS GOING TO GO WITH,

110
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,764
AND I STUCK WITH IT.

111
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,100
AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

112
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,977
BUT THAT'S JUST MY GAME.

113
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,270
>> IT PUTS US ON THE OUTS.

114
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,107
>> YEAH, ME, YOU, AND VETEAS.

115
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,358
YOU NEED TO FURTHER YOUR GAME

116
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,110
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A MUCH, MUCH

117
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,237
BIGGER TARGET ON ME.

118
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,281
DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO PULL

119
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,157
ME INTO ANYTHING.

120
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,491
IF YOU CAN FURTHER YOURSELF IN

121
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,035
THE GAME, PLEASE, DO SO.

122
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,412
I WANT THAT FOR YOU.

123
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,456
>> MY MOM MENTIONED THAT I NEED

124
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,583
TO HAVE A GAME PLAN BECAUSE IF

125
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,918
TRIBAL HAPPENS AND I'M A SITTING

126
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,377
DUCK, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

127
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:31,628
PRETTY.

128
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,713
SO SHE TOLD ME TO TRY TO BUILD

129
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,049
MY OWN INDIVIDUAL ALLIANCE AND

130
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,676
TALK TO PEOPLE AND SELL MY VOTE.

131
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,136
HOW I DO SELL MYSELF WHEN I HAVE

132
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,137
MY MOM ON THE LINE?

133
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,971
>> I LOVE YOU.

134
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,766
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

135
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,350
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME, ARE YOU?

136
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,477
>> NO!

137
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,394
THE IDEA OF BLOOD VERSUS WATER,

138
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,313
IT'S HARD TRYING TO SELL MYSELF

139
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,357
WITHOUT FLOWING MY LOVED ONE

140
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,232
UNDER THE BUS.

141
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,484
AND THAT'S KIND OF THE ISSUE I'M

142
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,151
FACED WITH.

143
00:03:55,234 --> 00:04:00,448
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAY,

144
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,535
"KEEP ME INSTEAD OF HER."

145
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,078
Captioning brought to you by

146

151
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,615
>> YES.

152
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,493

00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,538
I'LL TAKE THE NECKLACE BACK.

00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,206
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

156
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,082

TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO

THIS GOES BACK TO SEASON ONE.

161
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,756
GERVASE WAS A PART OF IT.

162
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,134
IT IS A FOOD EATING COMPETITION

163
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,177
IN WHICH YOU WILL RACE TO GET

164
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,430

SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT AND

GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE TOP OFF.

180
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,840
>> OH!

181
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,507
>> Jeff: THESE ARE MEAL WORMS.

182
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,467
THERE ARE 40 OF THEM.

183
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,136
THESE ARE EATEN OUT HERE ALL THE

184
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:45,344
TIME.

185
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,305
IN FACT, FISHERMEN ARE OUT, THEY

186
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,223
USE THESE.

187
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,391
IF THEY GET HUNGRY, THEY TAKE A

188
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,518

00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:00,534
SEASON ONE.

376
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,077
YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THIS.

377
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,745
>> GOTTA GO FOR IT.

378
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,454
>> GOTTA.

379
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,705
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE

380
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:04,872
GO.

381
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,624
THIS IS IT, FOR IMMUNITY.

382
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:06,916
>> GOLLY.

383
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,586
>> Jeff: SURVIVORS READY?

384
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:15,132
GO.

385
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,467
>> COME ON GERVASE.

386
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,009
>> Jeff: COME ON, GERVASE!

387
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,970
CHANGE HISTORY RIGHT HERE!

388
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:24,016
>> GET IT, GERVASE, COME ON.

389
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,435
>> Jeff: FIGHT THROUGH IT,

390
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:26,685
CULPEPPER.

391
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,606
KEEP IT DOWN!

392
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,149
MONICA HAS THE FIRST ONE DOWN.

393
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:32,775
MONICA WORKING ON HER SECOND.

394
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,069
GERVASE PUT BOTH OF THEM IN AT

395
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:35,277
ONCE.

396
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,862
>> GERVASE, YOU GOT IT.

397
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,489
TWO DIFFERENT STORIES.

398
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,824
FOR GERVASE A SHOT AT

399
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,867
REDEMPTION, FOR MONICA IT WOULD

400
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,910
BE HER FIRST INDIVIDUAL

401
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,995
IMMUNITY.

402
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,666
>> Jeff: MONICA HAS IT!

403
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,626
MONICA WINS IMMUNITY!

404
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,753
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

405
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,921
>> I'M SO HAPPY.

406
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,091
GERVASE, I LOVE YOU, AND I'M

407
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:02,263
SORRY, BUT THIS HAS BEEN... OF

408
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,556
MINE FOR A LONG TIME.

409
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,390
THANKS FOR HELPING ME.

410
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,766
>> GOOD TRY, JERV.

411
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,351
>> Jeff: MONICA WINS IMMUNITY.

412
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,310
SAFE TONIGHT AT THE VOTE.

413
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,438
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, 22 DAYS

414
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,772
INTO THIS GAME, SOMEBODY WILL BE

415
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,815
VOTED OUT, SENT TO REDEMPTION

416
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,899
ISLAND.

417
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,775
IT WON'T BE YOU.

418
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,151
CONGRATULATIONS.

419
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,652
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

420
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,653
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

421
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,613
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

422
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:25,244
( APPLAUSE )

423
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,555
GIRLS ARE DOING KATIE.

424
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,724
TONIGHT, THE PLAN IS FOUR VOTES

425
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,809
VISE' WAY, THREE VOTES KATIE'S

426
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:48,976
WAY.

427
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,561
AS OF RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW

428
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:54,648
IF ANYBODY HAS FOUND THE HIDDEN

429
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:54,857
MILE.

430
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,151
VYTAS MAY HAVE IT.

431
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,111
KATIE MAY HAVE IT.

432
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,654
TINA MAY HAVE IT.

433
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,864
>> I WASN'T THE ONE WHO CAME UP

434
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,866
WITH THE IDEA TO SPLIT THE

435
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,366
VOTES.

436
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,202
LAURA M. WAS LIKE, "IF THERE'S

437
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,661
AN IDOL OUT THERE WE NEED TO

438
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,079
SPLIT THE VOTES."

439
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,456
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS DO I

440
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,667
TELL THEM I HAVE THE IDOL SO WE

441
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,793
DON'T WORRY ABOUT SPLITTING

442
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,836
VOTES OR IS THAT GOING TO MAKE

443
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,213
ME TOO BIG OF A TARGET?

444
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:17,838
I DON'T WANT TO TELL PEOPLE I

445
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,924
HAVE THE IDOL SO I HAVE TO JUST

446
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:20,925
ROLL WITH IT.

447
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,051
HE'S COMING UP THE BEACH RIGHT

448
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:22,218
NOW.

449
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,054
>> HOW WAS YOUR SHOWER.

450
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,722
>> HOW WAS THE TALK?

451
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,681
>> GREAT.

452
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,643
>> WHICH ONE OF US IS NEXT?

453
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,977
>> ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

454
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:32,311
( LAUGHTER ).

455
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,355
>> GOING INTO THAT CHALLENGE, I

456
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,232
KNEW I NEEDED TO WIN IMMUNITY TO

457
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:36,899
ENSURE MY STAY.

458
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,317
AND I LOST IT.

459
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,110
SO RIGHT NOW, I'VE GOT PLENTY OF

460
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,278
WORK TO DO IF I WANT TO BE ABLE

461
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,696
TO STAY AROUND HERE JUST ANOTHER

462
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,906
DAY OR TWO.

463
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,617
WELL AT LEAST GIVE IT TO ME

464
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:46,992
STRAIGHT.

465
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,410
AM I GOING HOME TONIGHT?

466
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,078
YOU OWE ME THAT.

467
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,746
>> I'M GOING TO SHOOT STRAIGHT

468
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,872
WITH YOU 100%.

469
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,415
IT'S GOING TO BE YOU OR KATIE.

470
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,125
>> WE SPLIT FOR THE IDOL.

471
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,377
>> THIS IS THE WAY THE VOTE IS

472
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,669
GOING TO BE.

473
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,254
>> SO THERE ARE SEVEN.

474
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,797
SO IT'S GOT TO BE 4-3.

475
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,089
>> RIGHT.

476
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,425
>> SO HOPEFULLY, FOUR WILL GO TO

477
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,592
KATIE.

478
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,802
JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE, MAN.

479
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,680
>> I CAN'T.

480
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,306
>> IT'S A LITTLE LOW TO BEG FOR

481
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,516
MY POSITION ON THE TRIBE BUT I

482
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,809
REALLY HAVE NO OTHER PLAY.

483
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,977
JUST ANOTHER TWO DAYS ONN THIS

484
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,020
GAME COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER 12

485
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,105
DAYS IN THIS GAME, COULD LEAD TO

486
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,648
$1 MILLION.

487
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,274
IT'S SCRATCHING AND CLAWING TO

488
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,066
GET THROUGH TONIGHT'S TRIBAL.

489
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,695
AT THIS POINT, I'LL PUT KATIE'S

490
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,447
NAME DOWN IF IT GETS ME FURTHER.

491
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,782
I THINK IN THE END IT'S JUST

492
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,284
ABOUT NOT TURNING ON EACH OTHER.

493
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,077
I'M NOT TURNING OW GIRLS.

494
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,246
>> WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUS, BUT

495
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,746
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

496
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,790
>> I'M IN A VERY TIGHT JAM.

497
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:35,374
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALLIANCES

498
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:35,958
PEOPLE HAVE RIGHT NOW.

499
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,752
MY MOM TOLD ME THAT I HAVE TO DO

500
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,545
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

501
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,338
SO I NEED TO FIGURE OUT A

502
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,715
DIFFERENT GAME POLICEMAN PLAN.

503
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,008
WHETHER THAT INCLUDES JUST ME OR

504
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:49,305
MY AND MY MOTHER.

505
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,098
>> I'M GETTING NERVOUS.

506
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,183
SEVEN US MADE A PACT THAT WE

507
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,935
WILL SPLIT THE VOTE BETWEEN

508
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,354
VYTAS AND KATIE.

509
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,815
SO THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN WAS.

510
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,693
HOWEVER, I'M NOT REALLY QUITE

511
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,194
SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING OR WHO IS

512
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,281
SAYING WHAT OR WHO'S DRIVING THE

513
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:07,489
BOAT.

514
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,700
BUT WHY THE SUDDEN SCRAMBLE?

515
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,327
IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY

516
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:11,660
UNCOMFORTABLE.

517
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,953
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE WAS IT ME

518
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,122
GOING HOME TONIGHT.

519
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,249
SO THERE'S THIS MAD SCRAMBLE.

520
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:17,541
>> YOU WON.

521
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,668
>> THE BOYS ARE VOTING VYTAS.

522
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,128
>> AND WE'RE ALL WRITING KATIE.

523
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,004
>> ALL RIGHT, KATIE.

524
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:22,504
>> THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I'M

525
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,673
LAYING HERE THINKING THERE'S A

526
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,759
WHOLE LOT OF SCRAMBLING GOING

527
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:26,925
ON.

528
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,720
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ME TONIGHT.

529
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,765
>> MONICA'S ASKING WHY EVERYBODY

530
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,223
IS SCRAMBLING AROUND?

531
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,185
WHY THE DOES SHE CARE?

532
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,311
SHE HAS THE NECKLACE.

533
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,771
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.

534
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,898
THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW

535
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,526
PARNOTIFIED A PERSON MONICA IS.

536
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,070
>> I KNOW THERE'S SEVEN YOU

537
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,278
GUYS.

538
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,946
YOU GOTTA SPLIT FOUR TO THREE

539
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,156
SOME WAY.

540
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,116
SPLIT THREE ON ME, PLEASE.

541
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,534
>> MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

542
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:52,701
DOING.

543
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,495
>> BUT I JUST KIND OF ADD A

544
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,996
LITTLE SALT IN THE WOUND TO GO

545
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,289
RIGHT AFTER ARAS LIKE THAT.

546
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,249
>> AND THERE'S ALSO ONE LESS

547
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,959
PAIR OUT IF I STAY.

548
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,629
AS EVIDENCED BY LAST TRIBAL, YOU

549
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,547
KNOW, PAIRS ARE DANGEROUS.

550
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,715
>> ALL VALID POINTS.

551
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,341
>> AND I'LL PROMISE YOU THIS, IF

552
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,802
YOU KEEP ME AROUND ANOTHER ONE,

553
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,346
I'M MUCH MORE OPEN TO GIVING YOU

554
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,389
MY JURY VOTE AT THE END.

555
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,391
AT THIS POINT, THAT'S ALL I HAVE

556
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:15,557
LEFT.

557
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,101
>> VYTAS MADE SOME VALID POINTS

558
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,477
BUT THE MAIN CONCERN FOR ME

559
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,146
RIGHT NOW IS IF THE GIRLS WISE

560
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,816
UP, THEY COULD PERHAPS FORM AN

561
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,984
ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE, SENDING A

562
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,528
GIRL HOME WOULD KEEP VYTAS HERE

563
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,196
AND STILL KEEP THE GUYS IN THE

564
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:29,571
STRONG MAJORITY.

565
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,449
SO MY LIST OPT MALE RIGHT NOW

566
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,537
WOULD BE TO HAVE KATIE GO NEXT.

567
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,996
>> SINCE KATIE IS PLAYING HARDER

568
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,248
RIGHT NOW, WE SHOULD SEND HER.

569
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:39,873
>> THAT'S TRUE.

570
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,543
>> BUT IF WE'RE SOLID IT DOESN'T

571
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,127
MATTER WHAT ORDER WE DO IT IN.

572
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,379
>> RIGHT, BUT WE SHOULD DECIDE

573
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:45,629
RIGHT NOW.

574
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,214
THEN YOU CAN LET YOUR MOM KNOW.

575
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,173
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

576
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,717
>> I'LL DO WHATEVER.

577
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,843
>> THIS IS WHEN IT GETS

578
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,427
DANGEROUS FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME,

579
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,053
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO COME OFF

580
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,848
AS THE KINGPIN OR THE DECISION

581
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,056
MAKER.

582
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,474
I WANT EVERYONE TO FEEL THEIR

583
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,560
INPUT IS WHAT MATTER MATTERS ANT

584
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,060
JUST MINE.

585
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,687
SO RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO BE VERY

586
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,565
CAREFUL ABOUT THIS VOTE TONIGHT.

587
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,130
>> Jeff: TINA, AFTER YOU GET

588
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,924
BACK TO CAMP AFTER THE LAST

589
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,217
TRIBAL, ARAS HAS BEEN

590
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:32,801
BLINDSIDED, WHAT WENT DOWN?

591
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,137
>> WELL, JEFF, IT WAS ONE OF

592
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,388
THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE I SHOULD

593
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,181
HAVE JUST KEPT MY BIG MOUTH

594
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:37,389
SHUT.

595
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:45,314
BUT I JUST COME OUT CUSSING

596
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:45,522
MONICA.

597
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,983
>> Jeff: VYTAS, IT WAS YOUR

598
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,776
BROTHER THEY TOOK OUT.

599
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,569
>> I WAS REALLY HAPPY TINA SAID

600
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,445
WHAT SHE DID.

601
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,196
I WAS FEELING IT.

602
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,282
YOU VOTED OUT MY BROTHER.

603
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,200
LIKE, I'M GOING TO ( BLEEP ) YOU

604
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,910
UP, MAN.

605
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,037
HOW DARE YOU VOTE OUT MY LITTLE

606
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,287
BROTHER.

607
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,163
I'M MY BROTHER'S KEEPER, AND IF

608
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,499
YOU DO THAT IN THIS GAME, I'LL

609
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,750
DO THE BEST TO GET YOU BACK.

610
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,002
I COULDN'T SAY THAT THEN, I'M

611
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:07,544
STILL STILL IN THIS GAME.

612
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,087
>> Jeff:YOU JUST SAID IT.

613
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,089
>> I'M SAYING THAT'S A NATURAL

614
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:11,340
FEELING.

615
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:11,924
EVERYBODY HAS IT.

616
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,884
I WANTED THE FEELING TO COME OUT

617
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,093
FIRST, HEY, I GET IT.

618
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,136
I TOTALLY GET IT.

619
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,888
>> Jeff: GERVASE, YOU CAN

620
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,139
RELATE A LITTLE TO VYTAS?

621
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,350
>> OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND HIS

622
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,142
ANGER, HIS RESENTMENT, ALL HIS

623
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,270
EMOTIONAL FEELINGS TOWARDS VYTAS

624
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,314
BEING VOTED OUT.

625
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,775
WHEN MARISSA GOT THROWN OUT, I

626
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,902
SAID I'M GOING TO WIN EVERY

627
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,945
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

628
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,154
I UNDERSTAND YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

629
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,659
>> I KNOW IT'S A GAME ABOUT

630
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,034
BETRAYAL.

631
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:39,618
THEY'RE SAYING ARAS HAD ALL OF

632
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,869
THESE ALLIANCES.

633
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,246
HE HAD A COUPLE AND PEOPLE

634
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,413
INTIMIDATED BY ARAS OR MYSELF

635
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,040
BLEW A LITTLE BIT OF AIR INTO

636
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:45,374
THAT FIRE.

637
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,626
NUMBER LIKE MONICA, WHO IS

638
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,253
ALREADY SO PARANOID OUT HERE,

639
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,588
SHE FELL FOR IT RIGHT AWAY.

640
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,715
YOU TELL HER SHE'S A DOOR MAT,

641
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,468
AND YOU SAY, TELL ME I'M A WORD

642
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:56,718
MAT.

643
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,177
>> I GAVE YOU MY WORD.

644
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,471
AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE IS MY

645
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,139
INTEGRITY OUT HERE.

646
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,434
I THINK YOU FLOPPED ON MY

647
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,894
HUSBAND, AND MY HUSBAND IS GONE,

648
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,106
BUT I STUCK MY NECK OUT TO GET

649
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,983
THRU TO LIVE VICARIOUSLY THROUGH

650
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,233
YOU ALL.

651
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,737
>> YOU WERE GETTING FURTHER TOO.

652
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,740
THIS MONICA THE BENEVOLENT

653
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:18,949
THING.

654
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,285
WOO WH WE LEFT GALANG, IT WAS

655
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,078
I'M TRUSTING YOU AND YOU'RE

656
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,371
TRUSTING ME, AND YOU BROKE THAT

657
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:24,580
TRUST.

658
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,248
>> Jeff: KATIE, IS IT SAFE TO

659
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,292
ASSUME THAT IT'S YOU, YOUR MOM,

660
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,127
OR VYTAS TONIGHT?

661
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,503
>> YES.

662
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:31,795
ABSOLUTELY.

663
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,671
IT COULD BE ME TONIGHT.

664
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,173
AND IF NOT, THEN I'M GOING TO

665
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,716
LOOK FOR THE CRACKS.

666
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,384
AND HOPEFULLY, THERE'S SOMEONE

667
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,095
HERE THAT WILL MAKE A MOVE.

668
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,263
>> Jeff: VYTAS, WHAT DO YOU

669
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,431
SAY TO THESE GUYS?

670
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,891
WHAT'S YOUR CASE?

671
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,017
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

672
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,642
WHAT IF THE GIRLS TRY TO MAKE A

673
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,394
MOVE, AND YOU DON'T HAVE A GUY

674
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,604
LEFT, AND THE GIRLS ARE GOING TO

675
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,938
HAVE THAT NUMBER.

676
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,899
I THINK THAT IF GITONIGHT, THE

677
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,734
WOMEN WOULD BEHOOVE THEMSELVESES

678
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,360
TO REALLY, AND I THINK TYSON AND

679
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,029
GERVASE HAVE THE MOST POWER IN

680
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:57,905
THEIR ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW.

681
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,323
AND THOSE SHOULD BE THE GUYS

682
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:03,452
THAT THESE GIRLS SHOULD GET OUT.

683
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,244
>> Jeff: OKAY.

684
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,329
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

685
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:21,219
LAURA, YOU'RE UP.

686
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,973
>> WHAT UP, BRAD?

687
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,869
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

688
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,830
VOTES.

689
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,558
HIDDEN MILEAND YOU WANT TO PLAY

690
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:13,313
TNOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

691
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,648
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

692
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,399
DECISION IS FINAL.

693
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,608
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

694
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,526
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

695
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:17,818
IMMEDIATELY.

696
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,321
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

697
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:28,537
FIRST VOTE, VYTAS.

698
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,958
KATIE.

699
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,004
THAI SUN.

700
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,588
VYTAS.

701
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:38,880
VYTAS.

702
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,590
THAT'S THREE VOTES VYTAS, ONE

703
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,385
VOTE KATIE, ONE VOTE TYSON.

704
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,390
THAT'S FOUR VOTES VYTAS.

705
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:56,606
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

706
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,820
"SURVIVOR: BLOOD VERSUS WATER."

707
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,946
VISE VYTAS.

708
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,990
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

709
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,659
VYTAS, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

710
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,952
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET

711
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,078
BACK IN THIS GAME.

712
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,497
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

713
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,166
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

714
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,669
GOOD LUCK.

715
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,465
WELL, KATIE AND TINA, THE BAD

716
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,675
NEWS FOR YOU TWO IS THAT IT'S

717
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,635
VERY CLEAR YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM.

718
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,262
THE BAD NEWS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE,

719
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,806
IT MEANS YOU HAVE NOTHING TO

720
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,223
LOSE.

721
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,349
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

722
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,768
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

723
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,854
DPNT.

724
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,480
GOOD NIGHT.

725
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,212
>> WENT TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND I

726
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,546
WAS TOLD TO VOTE KATIE, BUT WITH

727
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,757
THE PRESSURE THAT I HAD BEEN

728
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,093
GIVEN BY VYTAS, AND THE VITRIOL

729
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,719
ATTACK THAT I HAD BEEN GIVEN BY

730
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,763
HIM AT TRIBAL, I CHOSE TO WRITE

731
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,472
DOWN VYTAS.

732
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:16,603
I WROTE HIS NAME DOWN.

733
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,524
HEY, HAYDEN, WHEN I WROTE VYTAS,

734
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,566
I SAID, "WHAT UP, BRAD?"

735
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,112
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

736
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,072
>> MONICA AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

737
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,198
DECIDED TO SWITCH HER VOTE.

738
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:28,782
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO VOTE FOR

739
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,700
KATIE, BUT SHE DECIDES TO VOTE

740
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,578
FOR VYTAS.

741
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,454
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED AND THAT

742
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,249
WAS THE REASON WHY TYSON GOT

743
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,500
VOTE OUT, I GOT VOTED OUT, OR

744
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,169
ANYBODY ELSE IN MY ALLIANCE, I

745
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,963
WOULD HAVE LOST IT.

746
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,798
IT'S SIMPLE-- DON'T ROCK THE

747
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,006
BOAT.

748
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,633
MOVES LIKE THAT MAKE ME SAY YOU

749
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:46,883
KNOW WHAT?

750
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,552
LET'S GET RID OF MONICA NEXT.

751
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,888
ONE MORE STRAW, AND THE CAMEL'S

752
00:23:51,972 --> 00:24:01,523
BACK WILL BE BROKEN.

753
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,067
>> I DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE YOU

754
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,360
LAST NIGHT, MAN.

755
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,737
>> YOU'RE THE ONE THAT GOT US

756
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,613
OUT OF THE GAME, BRO, COME ON.

757
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,532
>> THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD HAVE

758
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,449
SEEN IT.

759
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,284
>> THERE WERE SIGNS.

760
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,368
>> I THINK ARAS IS RESPONSIBLE

761
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,870
FOR GETTING ME HERE BECAUSE HE

762
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,245
SAID HE WAS GOOD.

763
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,998
I MEAN, I'M NOT GOING TO BRING

764
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,457
ANYBODY INTO AN ALLIANCE WITH MY

765
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,001
BROTHER AND SAY WE'RE 100% IF

766
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,127
WE'RE NOT 100%.

767
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,461
HE MADE THAT MISTAKE.

768
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,132
AND NOW I'M HERE GUILT BY

769
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:27,424
ASSOCIATION.

770
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,384
>> I'M STILL IN THIS GAME, BRO.

771
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,927
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT.

772
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,429
>> IT'S DIFFERENT, WE'RE NOT

773
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:32,929
ACTUALLY IN THE GAME.

774
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:33,597
>> WE'RE IN THE GAME.

775
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,598
>> IT'S PURGATORY.

776
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,433
>> IT'S NOT PURGATORY.

777
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,309
I'M IN THE GAME.

778
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,685
IF I WASN'T IN THE GAME, I WOULD

779
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,728
BE EATING A CHEESEBURGER RIGHT

780
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:39,895
NOW.

781
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,647
I'M NOT EATING A CHEESEBURGER SO

782
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,023
I'M IN THE GAME.

783
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,692
I'M GOING TO COME BACK AND WIN

784
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,027
THE GAME OR I WON'T.

785
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,402
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

786
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,571
>> MY BROTHER HAS A VERY

787
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,614
NEGATIVE ENERGY AND I HAVE A

788
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,573
MUCH MORE POSITIVE ENERGY.

789
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,657
I LOVE HIM NO MATTER WHAT, BUT

790
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,035
BEST THINGS DON'T COME WHEN

791
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:55,577
YOU'RE PESSIMISTIC.

792
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,912
THEY COME WHEN YOU'RE OPEN AND

793
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,666
YOU'RE LIGHT.

794
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,709
>> THAT WILL BE GREAT.

795
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,003
IF YOU GET OUT OF REDEMPTION, I

796
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,130
WOULD BE JUST AS HAPPY AS IF I

797
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,173
GOT OUT OF REDEMPTION.

798
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,549
>> I CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR YOU.

799
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,762
I'M SORRY.

800
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:24,856
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

801
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,199
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

802
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:34,616
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

803
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,951
>> YES, SIR.

804
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,285
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

805
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,163
MONICA, TAKE IT BACK.

806
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,873
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

807
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,333
FOR GRABS.

808
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,252
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL

809
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,796
BALANCE THE SWORD ON A CHEELD.

810
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,589
WITH THE OTHER HAND, YOU WILL

811
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,716
STACK COINS ON THE HANDLE.

812
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,134
WHEN THE STACK BECOMES TOO HIGH,

813
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,096
IT WILL BECOME HARD TO BALANCE.

814
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,222
THE COINS WILL FALL.

815
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,723
AND WHEN THE COINS FALL, YOU'RE

816
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,891
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

817
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,561
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

818
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,355
IMMUNITY, IS SAFE AT THE VOTE.

819
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,773
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE

820
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,316
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,234
THIS TRIBE AND SENT TO

822
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,610

WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND WE'LL

824
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,617
GET STARTED.

825
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,661
HERE WE GO.

826
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,246
EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR SWORD.

827
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:27,627
PLACE IT ON THE SHIELD.

828
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,212
FIRST COIN YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE

829
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:34,175
IS A SMALL COIN.

830
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,262
NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD A MEDIUM

831
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:37,721
COIN TO THAT.

832
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:43,351
GOING TO ADD ANOTHER SMALL COIN.

833
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,147
WE'RE GOING TO ADD A LARGE COIN.

834
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:47,689
BIGGEST ONE IN YOUR PILE.

835
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:55,655
YOU'VE NOT USED IT YET.

836
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,698
CIERA, LEFT HAND ALREADY SHAKING

837
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,619

838
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:07,709
GOING TO ADD ANOTHER SMALL.

839
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,338
AND JUST LIKE THAT, MONICA DROPS

840
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,172
HER COIN.

841
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,298
MONICA IS OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.

842
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,343
>> WOW.

843
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,927
>> Jeff: CIERA DROPS HER COIN.

844
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,095
SHE IS OUT.

845
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:19,387
>> CRAZY.

846
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:19,971
>> Jeff: YOU CANNOT LOSE YOUR

847
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,639
FOCUS IN THIS CHALLENGE.

848
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,933
IF YOU DRIFT A LITTLE, AND THAT

849
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,560

850
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:44,329

COIN DROPPED ON TINA.

00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,924
TINA IS OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE.

855
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,217
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

856
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,302
TAKE A STEP BACK.

857
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:05,642
AND WE ARE DOWN TO SIX.

858
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:21,157

>> AWESOME.

931
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,112
>> WELL, I'VE GOT FIVE HOURS TO

932
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:46,988
FIND THAT IDOL.

933
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,573
THE REST OF THE DAY, THAT'S WHAT

934
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,907
I'M DOING.

935
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,283
>> OKAY.

936
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,911
>> AND I DON'T CARE IF THEY KNOW

937
00:31:53,995 --> 00:32:00,251
IT.

938
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,506
>> THERE SHE GOES.

939
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,550
>> TINA JUST TOOK OFF THAT WAY.

940
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,426
>> OKAY.

941
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,094
>> WE'RE ALL GOING TO FOLLOW

942
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,513
TINA, EVERYBODY.

943
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,098
>> I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY CLUES

944
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,226
TO WHERE THE IDOLS ARE, EXCEPT

945
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,896
KATIE SAID THAT IT WAS BETWEEN

946
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,066
SALT WATER AND FRESH WATER.

947
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:27,362
IT'S LIKE FINDING A NEED NEL A

948
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,198
HAYSTACK.

949
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,992
>> I DON'T THINK SHE'S UP THIS

950
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:33,201
HIGH.

951
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,702
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

952
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,411
SHY WOULD HAVE HAD TO RUN.

953
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,538
>> WE HEAD OUT, AND WE LOSE HER.

954
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,707
WE LOST HER ON THE WATERFALL

955
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,667
TRAIL.

956
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,251
I'M THINKING, WHAT THE HECK.

957
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,169
SHE DID GET THE SLIP ON US.

958
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,045
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

959
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,215
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD SPLIT UP?

960
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,008
>> WANT TO DO THAT?

961
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:49,967
OKAY, DO IT.

962
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,135
THE IDEA WAS PEOPLE WOULD FOLLOW

963
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,263
TINA AROUND IN CASE SHE FIND THE

964
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:54,472
IDOL.

965
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,181
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

966
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:59,185
I GO TO EVERYBODY AND SAY I HAVE

967
00:32:59,268 --> 00:32:59,560
THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

968
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,729
WE CAN ALL TAKE NAPS.

969
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,356
BUT THEN I BECOME A TARGET.

970
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,857
TODAY, WE HAVE TO BABY SIT TINA

971
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,566
ALL THE TIME.

972
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,192
SHE LOOKED IN THE RIGHT SPOT BUT

973
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,277
IT WAS GONE BECAUSE I MOVED IT

974
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,197
TO A SAFE PLACE.

975
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,532
>> ARE WE READY TO GO BACK?

976
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,741
>> WE ARE.

977
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,367
>> OKAY!

978
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,326
READY TO GO BACK AND EAT?

979
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:15,576
>> YEAH.

980
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,745
>> OKAY.

981
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,122
>> OR YOU CAN STAY.

982
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:19,455
WE DON'T CARE.

983
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,165
>> OKAY.

984
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,042
>> WE'LL STAY WITH YOU.

985
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:30,675
>> OKAY.

986
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,884
>> HOW'S IT GOING?

987
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,136
>> GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

988
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:33,428
>> I'M GOOD.

989
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:43,229
>> GOOD.

990
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,898
>> I'M DEFINITELY IN A MEXICAN

991
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,191
STANDOFF, AND I'VE GOT TO FIND

992
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,319
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

993
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,988
THEY DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE IT OR

994
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,073
NOT, AND IF I START SEARCHING

995
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,074
FOR TTHEN THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW

996
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,743
I DON'T HAVE IT.

997
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,536
SO I'M JUST GOING TO STAY HERE

998
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,287
FOR A WHILE.

999
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:06,961
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.

1000
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:15,011
.>> SHE FIND THE IDOL, WHAT?

1001
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,638
>> SPLIT VOTES BETWEEN-- IF SHE

1002
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:22,059
FINDS THE IDOL, AND HER

1003
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:22,810
DAUGHTER'S GOT IMMUNITY.

1004
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,687
>> I'M NOT SURE WHOSE HAPPENING.

1005
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,229
WE'LL SPLIT VOTES.

1006
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,272
BETWEEN WHO?

1007
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,566
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO GO HOME.

1008
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:33,488
THE QUESTION IS COULD IT BE ME.

1009
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,782
>> THEY'RE NOT GOING FIND IDOL.

1010
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,240
WE'LL WATCH THEM.

1011
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,700
>> ALL RIGHT, WE'RE STICKING TO

1012
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:37,909
THEM.

1013
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:38,868
>> TONIGHT, IT'S MORE

1014
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,994
COMPLICATED THAN I THOUGHT IT

1015
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:40,787
WAS GOING TO BE.

1016
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,455
THE THING IS, IS WE CAN'T SPLIT

1017
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,706
THE VOTES.

1018
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,625
BECAUSE THEN MONICA FEELS LIKE

1019
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,793
SHE'S ON BOTTOM.

1020
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,712
AND SHE'S A REAL WILD CARD, THAT

1021
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:49,921
GIRL.

1022
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,047
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING

1023
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,298
TO DO, AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES HER

1024
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,424
DANGEROUS.

1025
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,261
>> MONICA HAS SHOWN TO US THAT

1026
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,387
SHE'S GETTING SUPER PARANOID,

1027
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,180
WHICH SHE HAS A REASON TO BE

1028
00:34:59,263 --> 00:34:59,430
PARANOID.

1029
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,099
>> AS LONG AS WE STICKS WITH THE

1030
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,226
DAMN PLAN AND STOPS GOING

1031
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:03,518
RENEGADE.

1032
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,268
>> KNOW.

1033
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,939
>> WHAT DID YOU WRITE VYTAS FOR.

1034
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,149
THE PLAN WAS NOT TO WRITE
VYTAS'

1035
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:10,399
NAME DOWN.

1036
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,069
LOOSE CANNONS WILL ALWAYS SHOOT

1037
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:13,236
OFF.

1038
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,737
AND WHEN THEY DO, NINE TIMES OUT

1039
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,782
OF 10 THEY WILL SINK SOMETHING

1040
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,825
YOU'RE RIDING ON.

1041
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,743
I WOULDN'T MIND VOTING MONICA

1042
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:20,910
OUT.

1043
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,038
>> ON THE OFF CHANCE, TINA DID

1044
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:26,582
FIND THE IDOL, WE ALL JUST

1045
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:26,833
MONICA.

1046
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,919
>> WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE GOING

1047
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,211
RENEGADE.

1048
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,045
YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN.

1049
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,880
>> MONICA IS ON THE OUTS BECAUSE

1050
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,257
WE CAN'T TRUST HER.

1051
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,174
EVEN IF TINA DOES NOT HAVE THE

1052
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,343
IDOL, WE MIGHT HAVE TO CUT OUR

1053
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,970
DISPIEZ SAY, SORRY, MONICA.

1054
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,304
WE HAVE TO CUT YOU LOOSE.

1055
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,306
>> MAYBE IT IS MONICA.

1056
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,685
MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO GO NEXT.

1057
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,167
>> Jeff: OKAY, SO AT THE LAST

1058
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,544
TRIBAL COUNCIL, THERE WAS A VERY

1059
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,462
CLEAR ALLIANCE OF SEVEN.

1060
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,714
VYTAS WAS VOTED OUT.

1061
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,424
SO UNLESS SOMETHINGS THAT

1062
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,676
CHANGED THAT WOULD LEAVE TINA

1063
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,094
AND KATE NETROUBLE.

1064
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,470
KATIE WINS IMMUNITY TODAY, AND

1065
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,181
PUTS IT ALL OW, TINA.

1066
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:23,931
>> OH, YEAH.

1067
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,141
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

1068
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,642
>> Jeff: SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

1069
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,519
>> WELL, I ALL I COULD DO WAS

1070
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:35,985
TRY TO FIND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1071
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,820
IDOL BUT WHAT WAS SO HYSTERICAL

1072
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,114
IS I HAD BABY SITTERS ALL DAY.

1073
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,490
THEY WENT EVERYWHERE I WENT SO I

1074
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,284
HAD TO PULL A FAST ONE AND GET

1075
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,619
AWAY FROM THEM AND AND RUN HIDE

1076
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,328
FOR A WHILE.

1077
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:45,870
>> Jeff: DID YOU HAVE TIME

1078
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,164
FREE OF YOUR CAPTORS?

1079
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,540
>> TWICE TODAY.

1080
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,626
>> Jeff: BOY, TEEN AYOU JUST

1081
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,920
DROPPED THAT, TWO WORDS "TWICE

1082
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:54,128
TODAY."

1083
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,756
READ INTO THAT WHATEVER YOU

1084
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:56,964
WANT.

1085
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,300
TINA, THE OTHER AVENUE YOU HAVE

1086
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,094
WITH SEVEN PEOPLE IS TO FIND A

1087
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:02,303
CRACK.

1088
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,721
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT, BECAUSE

1089
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,306
IT CANNOT BE ALL OF THESE

1090
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:05,514
PEOPLE.

1091
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,683
I'M SORRY.

1092
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,351
AND, YOU KNOW, POOR MONICA,

1093
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,144
GUESS WHAT?

1094
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,898
YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM.

1095
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,025
>> Jeff: WOW.

1096
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,485
MONICA, TINA'S SAYING, LADY,

1097
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,611
YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM.

1098
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,528
>> THAT'S FINE.

1099
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,905
PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OPINIONS.

1100
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,157
BUT I'M ALSO WORKING INSIDE THE

1101
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,408
ALLIANCE OF SEVEN.

1102
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,577
AND I'VE HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH

1103
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,371
PEOPLE FROM DAY ONE.

1104
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:28,996
HOPEFULLY, THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

1105
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,415
WILL PULL THROUGH, AND WE'LL SEE

1106
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,291
WHERE WE STAND.

1107
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,626
>> SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU

1108
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,086
DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON THE

1109
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:35,336
BOTTOM?

1110
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:39,590
>> UM, YOU KNOW-- WHETHER OR NOT

1111
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,175
I'M ON THE BOTTOM, IT'S CLEAR

1112
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,510
AND APPARENT THAT TYSON AND

1113
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,844
GERVASE ARE TOGETHER.

1114
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,638
THAT HAYDEN AND CALEB ARE

1115
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:45,888
TOGETHER.

1116
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:46,514
AND THAT BOTH SETS OF MOTHERS

1117
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,475
AND DAUGHTERS ARE TOGETHER.

1118
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,144
SO DO I SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE I'M

1119
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,312
NUMBER SEVEN?

1120
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:53,521
SURE.

1121
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,107
>> Jeff: TINA, THERE'S YOUR

1122
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,315
CRACK.

1123
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,150
>> AND, JEFF, EVERY TRIBAL

1124
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,443
COUNCIL, SHE'S THE LAST ONE TOLD

1125
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,696
WHO TO VOTE FOR BECAUSE MONICA,

1126
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,321
SHE JUST TALKS WAY TOO MUCH.

1127
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:06,450
AND IT MAKES PEOPLE SCARED TO

1128
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:06,659
DEATH.

1129
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,536
>> Jeff: GERVASE, WHEN DOES

1130
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,413
SOMEBODY TALKING TOO MUCH BECOME

1131
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,707
A LIABILITY?

1132
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,291
>> INSTANTANEOUSLY.

1133
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,168
I DON'T LIKE WILD CARDS BECAUSE

1134
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:16,752
THEY CAN RUIN EVERYTHING JUST

1135
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,878
LIKE THAT.

1136
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,089
SO I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY HAND

1137
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,341
LOOKS LIKE ALL THE TIME.

1138
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,301
>> Jeff: SO, MONICA, WHAT IF

1139
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,303
THEY JUST GET RIFD YOU TONIGHT?

1140
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,847
THEY CAN GET RID OF TINA

1141
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,264
WHENEVER THEY WANT.

1142
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,890
>> SURE, YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT

1143
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:30,474
LITTLE BIT OF DOUBT.

1144
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,935
EVEN TODAY, EVERYBODY SAY, OKAY,

1145
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,353
SO WE'RE GOING TO VOTE TINA

1146
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:34,562
TONIGHT.

1147
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,397
AND I SAID HAS ANYBODY THOUGHT

1148
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,733
IF TINA HAS THE IDOL?

1149
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,359
AND THE RESPONSE WAS, "WE'LL

1150
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,235
SPLIT VOTES."

1151
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,070
I SAID IF SHE PLAYS THE IDOL AND

1152
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,197
ONE HAS THE NECKLACE, WHO ARE WE

1153
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,073
SPLITTING VOTES WITH?

1154
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:46,615
AND THEN IT WAS, "OH, YEAH,

1155
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,284
YOU'RE RIGHT."

1156
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:48,868
>> Jeff: DOES IT CONCERN YOU

1157
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,369
THAT MAYBE YOU'RE THE BOTTOM?

1158
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,498
>> IT COULD VERY WELL MEAN I'M

1159
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:54,999
THE BOTTOM.

1160
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:55,750
>> Jeff: HAYDEN WHAT,

1161
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,084
SITUATION WOULD IT MAKE SENSE IF

1162
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,419
YOU WERE THINKING OF SPLITTING A

1163
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,380
VOTE TO SAY, "YOU'RE RIGHT, WE

1164
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,339
DON'T NEED TO."

1165
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,466
IF TINA HAD THE IDOL, IT WOULD

1166
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,884
BE ONE OF THE SEVEN OF YOU GOING

1167
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,635
HOME IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BACKUP

1168
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:06,844
PLAN.

1169
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,178
>> OF COURSE.

1170
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,513
WE RUN ALL THE SCENARIOS THROUGH

1171
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,431
OUR MIEPPEDZ, AND IF SHE HAS THE

1172
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,142
IDOL AND WE ALL VOTE FOR TINA,

1173
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,602
IT IS ONE OF US GOING HOME, AS

1174
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,145
YOU SAID.

1175
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,230
ALL WE CAN DO IS THINK ABOUT IT,

1176
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:18,981
SHOULD WE SPLIT THE VOTE AND

1177
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,274
TAKE OUT THE BOTTOM?

1178
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:20,608
MAYBE WE SHOULD.

1179
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,567
>> AND THAT'S A REALLY SILLY

1180
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,863
PLAN BECAUSE I'M EXTREMELY

1181
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:26,155
TRUSTWORTHY.

1182
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:30,326
AND I HAVE NOT OFFERED OR MADE

1183
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,370
ANY PERSON A DEAL HERE AND ASKED

1184
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,288
FOR ONE IN RETURN.

1185
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:36,123
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD ASK

1186
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,125
FOR A BETTER PLAYER.

1187
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:38,667
>> Jeff: TINA, WHY QEEP YOU

1188
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,461
AND GET RID OF MONICA?

1189
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,631
>> WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS

1190
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,341
STRATEGY-WISE I THINK THEY NEED

1191
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,176
TO KNOW, TO LOSE MONICA TONIGHT

1192
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,470
WOULD NOT BE THAT CRUCIAL AS FAR

1193
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,471
AS NUMBERS ARE CONCERNED.

1194
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,140
THEY WERE GOING TO PLAN A

1195
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:53,808
BLINDSIDE ON SOMEBODY, BUT THEY

1196
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,352
DID NOT WANT TO DO IT UNLESS

1197
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,269
THEY ABSOLUTELY HAD TO.

1198
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,563
AND THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE A

1199
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,606
BLINDSIDE TONIGHT WOULD BE IF I

1200
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,274
FOUND THE IDOL.

1201
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,109
SO MAYBE I HAVE.

1202
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,235
MAYBE I HAVEN'T.

1203
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,530
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE.

1204
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:07,655
.

1205
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,615
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1206
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:09,824
TO VOTE.

1207
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:27,508
LAURA, YOU'RE UP.

1208
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,101
>> WHAT AN INSPIRATION.

1209
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,354
THANKS FOR THE FUN.

1210
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:49,905
STWR.

1211
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,199
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1212
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,786
VOTES.

1213
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,497
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1214
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,623
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1215
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,917
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1216
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,501
TO DO SO.

1217
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,670
>> JEFF.

1218
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,255
I WISH I FOUND IT!

1219
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,383
BUT I DIDN'T!

1220
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:10,426

00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,052
VOTES ARE READ, I DECISION IS

1222
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:12,219
FINAL.

1223
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,429
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1224
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,597
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1225
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,598

00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,267
