1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:03,420
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:08,591
"SURVIVOR," AT THE LEVU TRIBE,
THERE WAS A CLEAR DIVIDE.

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,802
>> IT'S 2-2, I'M STICKING WITH
YOU.

4
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,930
>> Jeff: AT THE YAWA TRIBE,
COLE COULDN'T HIDE HIS HUNGER.

5
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,515
>> HE LICKS EVERYTHING.

6
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,934
HE'S LIKE A PIG.

7
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:21,479
>> Jeff: AT THE SOKO TRIBE,
RYAN FOUND HIMSELF CAUGHT

8
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:25,066
BETWEEN A HERO --
>> VOTE FOR ROARK.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,608
>> YEAH.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,943
>> GET RID OF CHRISSY.

11
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:27,819
>> CHRISSY?

12
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:28,987
ALL RIGHT.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,281
>> THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE
PERSON WHO IS GOING TO HATE ME.

14
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:40,457
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
RYAN VOTED WITH CHRISSY.

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:40,915
ROARK.

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,502
AND BETRAYED ALI.

17
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,336
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,921
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

19
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,589
>> Jeff: 13 ARE LEFT.

20
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:55,972
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

21
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,183
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, RYAN?

22
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,601
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

23
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:03,521
YOU SAY, OH, J.P. OR CHRISSY OR
J.P. OR CHRISSY.

24
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,148
>> UH-HUH.

25
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,108
>> WHY CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME?

26
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,819
>> BECAUSE SHE AND YOU WERE
GETTING REALLY, REALLY CLOSE.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,489
>> RYAN, REALLY?

28
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,365
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WENT EXACTLY
AS PLANNED.

29
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:18,661
RYAN DID FOLLOW THROUGH ON HIS
WORD, WHICH IS AMAZING.

30
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,372
IT SHOWED ME THAT RYAN BELIEVES
THAT HE CAN GET FURTHER WITH ME

31
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,625
IN THIS GAME THAN HE CAN GET
WITH ALI.

32
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,460
>> YOU NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING.

33
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,171
LIKE THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE A
TWO-PEOPLE CONVERSATION AND YOU

34
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,172
NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

35
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,132
>> BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE TOO CLOSE.

36
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,008
>> I DON'T CARE.

37
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,301
THIS IS A GAME, RYAN.

38
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,803
YOU TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL.

39
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,553
I TRUST YOU.

40
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,972
I FEEL LIKE I TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING.

41
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,391
>> AND SHE DID NOT TELL ME
EVERYTHING.

42
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,143
>> WHO CARES ABOUT HER.

43
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:42,852
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

44
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,687
>> BECAUSE YOU WERE CLOSE TO
HER.

45
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,856
>> I KNEW THIS GIRL FOR FOUR
DAYS.

46
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,357
THAT'S THE THING.

47
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,691
YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME.

48
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,068
>> I DO TRUST YOU.

49
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,069
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL HER.

50
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:51,611
I DIDN'T TRUST HER.

51
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,029
THAT'S WHY SHE'S GONE.

52
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,364
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

53
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,366
>> YOU WERE REALLY CLOSE TO HER,
ALI.

54
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,700
YOU REALLY WERE.

55
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,576
>> FOUR DAYS.

56
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,410
>> THAT'S ALL IT TAKES.

57
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,996
WE VOTED TOGETHER.

58
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,664
WE WERE TOGETHER FOR SIX DAYS.

59
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,583
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS A SHOCK.

60
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,378
I WAS BETRAYED BY MY CLOSEST
ALLY IN THIS WHOLE ENTIRE THING,

61
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,754
YOU KNOW?

62
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,380
AND IT HURTS.

63
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,881
>> WAIT.

64
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,009
>> YOU THOUGHT I WOULD KICK YOU
TO THE CURB, RYAN?

65
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,886
>> NO, SHE WAS GOING TO.

66
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,764
>> I WOULD NEVER HAVE KICKED YOU
TO THE CURB, SO WHY WOULDN'T YOU

67
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,348
TELL ME.

68
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,558
>> BECAUSE I THOUGHT...

69
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,061
>> I SAID 100 TIMES I WASN'T
GOING TO COME OUT HERE AND CRY,

70
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:29,732
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ROUGH, AND I
JUST WANT TO DO MY BEST.

71
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,901
>> WERE YOU IN AN ALLIANCE WITH
YOU?

72
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,236
>> NEW YORK I WAS IN AN ALLIANCE
WITH HER.

73
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,865
>> I WOULD HAVE DIDN'T WHATEVER
YOU WANTED ME TO DO, RYAN.

74
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,241
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

75
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,411
>> BEING PUSHED DOWN TO THE
BOTTOM, IT'S A WAKE-UP CAULK

76
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,746
BECAUSE MOVING FORWARD, I HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND, IT'S JUST ME,

77
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,916
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I WILL
EVER TRUST RYAN AGAIN IN THIS

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,375
GAME.

79
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:47,876
>> I LOVE CHRISSY.

80
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,710
I THINK SHE'S GREAT.

81
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,087
>> YOU JUST WROTE CHRISSY'S NAME
DOWN.

82
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,300
>> BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED AS WELL.

83
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,259
WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO MAD?

84
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,344
>> HOW AM I GETTING MAD?

85
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:04,726
>> SO ALI RAILS INTO ME, AND IT
WAS A REALLY BAD LOOK FOR HER.

86
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,396
I WAS HOPING I COULD STILL WORK
WITH ALI AT THIS POINT.

87
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,608
UNFORTUNATELY ALI IS INFURIATED
WITH ME BECAUSE I DIDN'T TELL

88
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,111
HER, AND IT STINKS BECAUSE I
CAN'T HAVE ENEMIES IN THIS GAME.

89
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:25,204
SO SHE MAY HAVE TO GO.

90
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:30,376
SO SHE MAY HAVE TO GO.

91
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,469
>> OH, MY GOD, FIRST TIME
CATCHING FISH WITH A SPEARGUN,

92
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,471
IT IS AMAZING.

93
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,513
IT'S LIKE I CAN DO THIS.

94
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:47,018
I CAN DO ANYTHING THAT I PUT MY
HEART AND MIND TO.

95
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:47,644
LITTLE FISH.

96
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,353
IT'S STILL A FISH.

97
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,604
I AM PROVIDING FOR MY TRIBE.

98
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:54,108
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO BE
LIKE, YEAH, DUDE, I CAUGHT THE

99
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:54,400
FISH, TOO.

100
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,193
>> NICE.

101
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,028
>> IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT IT'S
SOMETHING.

102
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:57,487
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE MAN?

103
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,488
>> YEAH.

104
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,492
>> THE SIMPLE THINGS IN LIFE CAN
BE SO REWARDING.

105
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,328
>> FLAME BROILED.

106
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,287
FISH FILET.

107
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,500
>> OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

108
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,878
[LAUGHTER]
>> HE'S GONE, DOC.

109
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,004
>> NO, HE'S NOT GONE.

110
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,255
>> HE'S GONE.

111
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,340
>> THAT'S OKAY.

112
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,635
MY FISH IS NOT GONE.

113
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:25,682
HE JUST COOKED A LITTLE FASTER.

114
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,392
[LAUGHTER]
>> OH, I'M IS GLAD WE'RE ON A

115
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,520
TRIBE TOGETHER, MIKE.

116
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,315
>> MIKEY, THAT POOR GUY, HE WAS
DETERMINED, THOUGH.

117
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,566
THAT MAN NEVER GAVE UP.

118
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,403
THROUGH HELL OR HIGH WATER, MIKE
WAS COOKING THAT FISH, AND

119
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,988
EATING IT.

120
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,030
I'M PROUD OF HIM.

121
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,034
HE'S OUT OF HIS ELEMENT, AN HE'S
DOING GOOD.

122
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,577
WHAT DO YOU THINK, NOT BATTING
RIGHT?

123
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,037
>> NO, MAN.

124
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,539
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD.

125
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,665
THANKS FOR SHARING.

126
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:55,169
YOU KNOW, MIKE CAUGHT A SMALL
FISH AND HE SHARED THAT.

127
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,548
COLE CAUGHT A DECENT-SIZED FISH,
AND HE ATE IT FOR HIMSELF A

128
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,716
COUPLE TIMES THAT.

129
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,885
SHOWS RIGHT THERE WHO YOU SHOULD
WORK WITH IN THIS GAME.

130
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,388
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING THE SHARE
AND THINK ABOUT OTHERS OR

131
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,725
SOMEONE WHO IS JUST GOING TO
THINK ABOUT HIMSELF.

132
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,727
COLE IS SHOWING HIS TRUE COLORS.

133
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,354
AND THEY AIN'T GOOD.

134
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,397
>> SO SHOULD WE GET STARTED ON
THE RICE?

135
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,942
>> THE ONLY THING IS WE DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF RICE.

136
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,568
>> I'M GOOD.

137
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,236
>> I'M NOT EVEN HUNGRY.

138
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,529
>> I'M HAPPY WAITING.

139
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,699
>> I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD CUT
OUT A WHOLE MEAL.

140
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,743
THAT'S NOT HOW YOUR BODY WORKS.

141
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,704
>> THAT'S HOW IT HAS TO WORK
HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT

142
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,413
MUCH FOOD.

143
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,248
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE REALISTIC.

144
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,708
>> PLEASE DON'T CUT ME OFF.

145
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,586
I WAS TRYING TO TALK AND YOU
KIND OF DOMINATE CONVERSATIONS.

146
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,255
>> TALK, BUDDY.

147
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,216
TALK TILL YOUR HEART CAN'T HAVE
NO MORE.

148
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,426
>> EAT BIG WHILE YOU HAVE IT.

149
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,929
>> I'M SAYING NOBODY HERE IS
STARVING TO CHEW, AND WE CAN'T

150
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,930
JUST FEED YOU.

151
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,849
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT THE EAT YOUR
RICE, COOK IT.

152
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,935
>> THAT'S FINE.

153
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,772
>> I SAID WE'LL GO WITH WHAT WE
DECIDED.

154
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,523
I'M NOT GETTING ENOUGH FOOD AT
ALL, AND IT'S STUPID.

155
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,693
I'M NOT GOING TO BE STRONG
ENOUGH AT ANY CHALLENGE TO

156
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,905
GUARANTEE THAT WE'LL COME AWAY
WINNING, AND I REALLY NEED A

157
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,825
BIGGER SERVING BECAUSE WITHOUT
ME, THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY

158
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,163
VICTORY FOR THE YAWA TRIBE.

159
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:12,663
>> I'M SICK OF HIM.

160
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,540
I AM SO SICK OF HIM.

161
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,583
>> HE'S TRIPPING OUT.

162
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,419
>> HE'S A PIECE OF WORK IS WHAT
HE IS.

163
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,590
>> I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT HE'S 24,
BUT WHEN WE WERE 24, WE WEREN'T

164
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,424
LIKE THAT.

165
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,342
>> NO.

166
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,510
WE'LL LET HIM SEAL HIS OWN FATE.

167
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:30,139
>> THE TWO OF THEM, THEY'RE
TRYING TO BE A POWER COUPLE OR

168
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:30,640
WHAT.

169
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,349
>> THEY'RE TOGETHER.

170
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,600
>> YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS
SOMETIMES.

171
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,644
>> WHY DO I MAKE YOU NERVOUS?

172
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:39,315
>> BECAUSE I FORGET HOW TO TALK
TO REALLY PRETTY GIRLS.

173
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,150
>> SHE'S SMART GIRL.

174

00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,798

NO WAY.

349
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,003
>> OH, MY GOSH, THERE'S LIKE
SALAMI.

350
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,005
>> ARTICHOKE AND MUSHROOM.

351
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,966
>> IT'S MORE FUN TO EAT A WHOLE
PIZZA.

352
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,428
>> THIS WAS THE ONE TO WIN.

353
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,139
>> SITTING THERE WATCHING THEM
STRUGGLE AND J.P. DO IT WITH

354
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:50,723
EASE.

355
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,599
>> BASKING IN HIS GLORY.

356
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,976
>> YOU WERE SO GOOD WITH THAT
SLINGSHOT.

357
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,145
>> J.P. IS A TANK IN THESE
CHALLENGES.

358
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,106
I GUESS BEING A FIREFIGHTER HE
HAS THAT STRENGTH TO HIM, BUT HE

359
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,818
IS VERY ATHLETIC.

360
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,862
AND THE MERGE IS GOING TO HAPPEN
VERY SOON.

361
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,615
THE PHYSICAL PART OF THE GAME IS
A VERY BIG ASPECT, AND THAT

362
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,117
RAISES THE THREAT LEVEL OF J.P.

363
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,161
>> MY IDEAL FIRST DATE IS
BONFIRE ON THE BEACH.

364
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:12,953
>> REALLY?

365
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,205
>> YEAH, PICK DINNER UP
SOMEWHERE.

366
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,666
MOST OF THE TIME I DO A SALAD.

367
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,753
>> HE'S ALSO SOMEBODY WHO IS
TOUGH TO READ BECAUSE HE DOESN'T

368
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,004
TALK MUCH STRATEGY AT ALL.

369
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,299
J.P. LIKES TALKING ABOUT CHICKS
AND BARS AND STUFF THAT I DON'T

370
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,092
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

371
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,179
HE REALLY JUST HAS NO CLUE
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS GAME.

372
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,683
>> I PUT IT BACK IN MY TRUCK.

373
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,893
BIG SALAD TO GO.

374
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,687
YOU SIT ON THE BEACH AND SHARE,
MAKE A FIRE ON THE BEACH, HANG

375
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,689
OUT, LOOK AT THE STARS.

376
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,691
>> NOTHING LIKE SOME WOOD IN THE
BACK OF THE TRUCK.

377
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,526
>> YEAH.

378
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,697
>> J.P. DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT
THIS IS A SOCIAL GAME.

379
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,074
AND IT'S AMAZING THAT HE'S STILL
HERE.

380
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:54,370
SO IF WE GO THE TRIBAL COUNCIL,
MAYBE TAKING OUT A BIG, PHYSICAL

381
00:15:54,453 --> 00:16:01,210
THREAT RIGHT BEFORE THE MERGE
SHOULD BE PRIORITY NUMBER ONE.

382
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,796
>> WAIT, WAIT.

383
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,050
>> OUR CAMP, WHEN YOU WERE
LOOKING AT THE WELL, THIS IS

384
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,345
YOUR STOMACH, THIS IS THE WATER,
WHERE WAS THE IDOL?

385
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,013
>> WHERE I LOOKED INITIALLY.

386
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,515
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

387
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,227
>> DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD GO TO
ROCKS FOR EACH OTHER?

388
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,520
OR DO YOU THINK DESI WOULD FLIP?

389
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,106
>> I THINK DESI WOULD FLIP.

390
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:26,527
>> IF THERE IS AN IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE HERE SHORTLY WITH THIS

391
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,695
TRIBE, I AM NERVOUS.

392
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,032
THERE'S ONLY FOUR OFOUS, TWO
YELLOW, JOE AND DESI, AND THEN

393
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,952
ME AND DEVON, WHO ARE PRETTY
MUCH LIKE THIS.

394
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,579
WE'RE KIND OF AN UNBREAKABLE
ALLIANCE.

395
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,081
>> I WANT TO MAKE THE MERGE.

396
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,082
>> DON'T FLIP ON ME.

397
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,918
>> I'M NOT GOING TO FLIP ON YOU.

398
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,963
>> IN THE CASE OF THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL, IT'S LOOK LIKE IT WOULD

399
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,922
BE 2-2.

400
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:56,932
THE PLAN WOULD BE TO GET DESI TO
FLIP ON JOE.

401
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,435
>> HIGH AS WELL TAKE SOME OF
THIS, RIGHT?

402
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,230
>> KEEP YOUR EYES OUT FOR
COCONUTS.

403
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,773
THE ENERGY IS VERY TENSE AROUND
HERE.

404
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,108
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL STILL OUT, THERE

405
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,570
AND JOE IS GOOD AT FINDING
IDOLS.

406
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,779
HE'S ALREADY FOUND ONE.

407
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,947
THAT'S BETTER THAN MY RECORD.

408
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,909
>>BIG HERMIT CROWD SOME EVERYTHI
THAT JOE DOES IS SUSPICIOUS.

409
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,245
WE'RE US A LOOKING OUT FOR HIM
AND LOOKING TO SEE WHERE HE'S

410
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:18,954
LOOKING.

411
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,997
>> BEASTLY.

412
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,624
>> I GOT THE KEEP EAGLE EYES ON
JOE.

413
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,792
HE'S GOT ME NERVOUS.

414
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,963
>> YOU GUYS ARE REALLY CLOSE,
BUT JOE IS THE MOST STRATEGIC

415
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,590
PLAYER WE'VE MET.

416
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,426
HE COULD BE GETTING ANYONE TO
TRUST HIM JUST AS LONG AS IT

417
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,971
WORKS FOR HIM.

418
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,806
>> DEFINITELY HAD THAT THOUGHT.

419
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,349
>> DO YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU
CAN TRUST HIM?

420
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,058
>> YEAH.

421
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:44,313
I MEAN, I TRUST HIM AS FAR AS...

422
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,608
I THING HE'LL STICK WITH US TO A
POINT.

423
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,527
IT'S JUST MATTER OF TO WHAT
POINT.

424
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,990
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WOULD
YOU VOTE HIM OUT?

425
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,116
>> OH, YEAH.

426
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,830
I THINK IF HE DOESN'T GET VOTED
OUT, HE WINS THIS GAME.

427
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,415
ASHLEY BROUGHT UP THE IDEA OF
GETTING RID OF JOE.

428
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:08,337
I MEAN, I TRUST JOE TO THE POINT
THAT HE'LL USE ME AS AN ADVANCE

429
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,630
FOR HIMSELF IN THIS GAME.

430
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,300
BEYOND THAT, JOE IS ARGUABLY THE
MOST STRATEGIC PLAYER OUT HERE,

431
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,970
WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MAKE HIMSELF MOVE FURTHER IN

432
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:17,888
THIS GAME.

433
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,140
THAT'S GOING TO MAYBE NOT ALWAYS
BENEFIT ME.

434
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:26,355
SO IF THE LEVU TRIBE HAS TO GO
BACK THE TRIBAL COUNCIL I AM

435
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,856
ACTUALLY CONSIDERING GETTING RID
OF JOE AT THIS TIME.

436
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,024
>> YOU GOT WATER?

437
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:29,858
>> I'M GOOD.

438
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,902
>> YOU DON'T DRINK ENOUGH WATER,
MAN.

439
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,655
I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON YOU A
LITTLE BIT MORE.

440
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,323
>> FORGET ABOUT THAT STUFF, MAN.

441
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,407
I'M NOT STUPID.

442
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:42,204
I KNOW DEVON IS WATCHING ME
BECAUSE I'M DANGEROUS.

443
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,206
LIKE I'M ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR
IDOLS AND LOOKING FOR IDOLS.

444
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,085
MY GAME IS TO HAVE POWER,
CONTROL, AND TO MANIPULATE.

445
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,421
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING THE FIND A
CLUE.

446
00:18:51,505 --> 00:19:01,431
I JUST NEED SOME TIME ALONE TO
FIND IT.

447
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,516
OH, MY GOD.

448
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,350
IT TOOK FOUR DAYS TO FIND IT.

449
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,269
BUT I FINALLY FOUND A CLUE.

450
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,021
VERY SIMILAR TO THE HEALER CAMP.

451
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,273
I KNEW IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
SAYING?

452
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,440
I KNEW ABOUT THE WELL.

453
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,695
IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE FOUR FEET
AWAY INSTEAD OF FIVE FEET.

454
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,073
I DIDN'T REALLY GIVE DEVON ANY
REACTION.

455
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,116
>> NOTHING.

456
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,410
>> I DEFINITELY WANT TO GET RID
OF THE CLUE LATER.

457
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,204
THIS TIME AROUND, NO ONE IS
GOING TO KNOW THAT I HAVE IT.

458
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,455
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED INITIALLY.

459
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,417
WHEN I FOUND FIRST ONE, COLE.

460
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,086
THIS TIME AROUND IF I GET THE
IMMUNITY IDOL NEW YORK ONE IS

461
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,629
GOING TO KNOW THAT I HAVE THE
IDOL.

462
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,756
THAT RIGHT THERE IS TRUE POWER.

463
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:44,850
I WILL BE GETTING THAT IDOL
TONIGHT.

464
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:55,027
I WILL BE GETTING THAT IDOL
TONIGHT.

465
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,527
THIS IS NOT A VACATION FOR ME.

466
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,612
IT'S WORK.

467
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,071
FIND ANOTHER IDOL THAT
REPRESENTS MOVING FURTHER IN THE

468
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,616
GAME, AND THE FURTHER I GET, THE
CLOSER I GET THE THAT $1

469
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,783
MILLION.

470
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,285
THE CLOSER I CAN PROVIDE THAT
MUCH MORE FOR MY CHILDREN.

471
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,414
YOU KNOW, I TELL MY KIDS ALL THE
TIME, THINGS DON'T COME EASY.

472
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,168
YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK.

473
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,004
AND, YOU KNOW, MY KIDS ARE MY
MOTIVATION.

474
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,255
EVERYTHING I DO IS FOR THEM.

475
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,675
IF I HAD TO DIG A HOLE THE
LENGTH OF TENNESSEE, I'M GOING

476
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,635
TO DO IT.

477
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:26,600
OH, MAN.

478
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,604
HELLO, BABY.

479
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,647
I'VE BEEN AT TWO CAMPS.

480
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,107
THIS IS MY SECOND IDOL I'VE
FOUND.

481
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,317
I'M GOING TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

482
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,320
IF I MOVE ON TO THE MERGE, GUESS
WHAT, I'M GOING TO FIND THE

483
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,699
THIRD IDOL.

484
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:06,932
>> GROSS.

485
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,225
A WORM LITERALLY JUST FELL ON
ME.

486
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,184
DO YOU WANT IT TO EAT.

487
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,060
>> I'M GOOD.

488
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,729
>> A WORM JUST FELL OUT OF OUR
ROOF ON ME.

489
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,230
THAT'S GROSS.

490
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:13,855
>> YEAH.

491
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,523
>> RIGHT?

492
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,527
>> THAT'S WHY I COVER MY EARS.

493
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,445
>> OH, MY GOD.

494
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,699
>> HOW DID YOU DO THAT.

495
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,116
COLE?

496
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:24,491
ARE YOU OKAY?

497
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,534
>> WHAT?

498
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,243
>> COLE?

499
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,077
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

500
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,328
>> JUST LAY DOWN.

501
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,955
LAY DOWN.

502
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:30,914
PUT YOUR LEGS UP.

503
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,208
LAY LIKE THAT WITH YOUR LEGS UP
A LITTLE BIT.

504
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,419
DO WE HAVE WATER FOR HIM?

505
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,212
KEEP YOUR LEGS UP.

506
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:37,879
WHATTING JUST HAPPENED?

507
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,089
>> HE JUST PASSED OUT.

508
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,551
>> I THOUGHT I WAS STANDING UP
OVER THERE, AND THE NEXT THING

509
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,260
I'M DREAMING OR SOMETHING.

510
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,511
>> HE NEEDS TO EAT.

511
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,721
HE CAN HAVE MY PORTION OF RICE.

512
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,930
>> I FEEL GOOD NOW.

513
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,224
>> OF COURSE YOU DO.

514
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,183
YOU JUST PASSED OUT.

515
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,561
>> NO, BUT I'LL JUST CHILL AND
TAKE IT EASY.

516
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,564
>> I'M GOING TO COOK SOME RICE.

517
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,690
COLE FAIPGHTED.

518
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,694
MY INITIAL FEELING IS JUST
STRAIGHT FEAR, LIKE ALL OF US

519
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,070
ARE SCARED.

520
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,448
BUT DR. MIKE AND I WERE IN
CONTROL, WE KNEW TO GET FLUID IN

521
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:04,948
HIM.

522
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,075
WE KNEW TO GET FOOD.

523
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,077
HE DID WITH IT TWO HEALERS IN
THE HEALTHCARE WORLD.

524
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,454
>> I'M REALLY GOING TO BE OKAY.

525
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,289
>> WE KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE
OKAY.

526
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,790
>> I JUST STOOD UP TOO FAST.

527
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,543
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T, YOU ARE
DEPLETED.

528
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,127
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

529
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,087
IT'S A FOOD-RELATED ISSUE.

530
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:19,880
I FELT BAD FOR HIM.

531
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,465
I LITERALLY JUST WANTED TO HOLD
HIM.

532
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:25,594
AND IN THAT MOMENT I REALIZED
THAT I REALLY DO CARE FOR HIM A

533
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,097
LOT MORE THAN I THOUGHT I DID.

534
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,059
I'M NOT READY TO PLAY THIS GAME
PUT COLE.

535
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,435
DINNER IS SERVED.

536
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,520
>> I FEEL SO RIDICULOUS.

537
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,730
I JUST FEEL LIKE A BURDEN.

538
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,941
>> JUST EAT IT.

539
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,609
>> COLE, YOU OKAY OVER THERE?

540
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,611
>> YEAH, I'M GOOD.

541
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,113
>> COLE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

542
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,950
WE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE HE'S
FINE.

543
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,744
BUT COLE HAS BECOME A LIABILITY.

544
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,289
IF YOU DON'T FEEL WELL ENOUGH ON
DAY 16, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

545
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,958
FEEL ON DAY 17 AND 18 OR 23?

546
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,920
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP
PULLING AND PULLING HIM ALONG,

547
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,965
AND AT SOME POINT THE SCALES ARE
LIKE... WE NEED THE GET RID OF

548
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,008
COLE.

549
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,511
NOTHING EXCITING HERE HAPPENED
WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

550
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,595
COLE COULD NOT PASS OUT.

551
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,389
>> HE GOT UP AND PASSED OUT.

552
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,099
>> WOW.

553
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,809
>> FELL LIKE A TRE TRUNK.

554
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,144
>> TAKE IT EASY, BIG GUY.

555
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:16,812
DRINK SOME WATER.

556
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:22,526
>> THANKS FOR HAVING MY BACK.

557
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,946
>> I DON'T KNOW, DOC.

558
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:31,326
HE SHOULD HAVE WORRIED ABOUT HIS
APPETITE MORE THAN HIS SIX PACK.

559
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,036
PACK ON A FEW POUNDS, YOU KNOW?

560
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,662
HE'S A LIABILITY.

561
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,704
>> OH YEAH,.

562
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,373
I AGREE.

563
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,082
WE TAKE OUT COLE.

564
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,459
>> EXACTLY.

565
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,505
WE CAN'T PANDER AND CATER TO HIM
AND BABY HIM ANY LONGER.

566
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,132
>> I AGREE.

567
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,466
>> OUT.

568
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,468
IT'S FUNNY HOW THINGS WORK IN
THIS GAME.

569
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,011
WHEN COLE FELL OVER, HE SEALED
HIS FATE.

570
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,515
I FEEL BAD SAYING, THAT BUT IT'S
TRUE.

571
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,352
I THINK LAUREN AND DOC HAVE THE
SAME AGENDA AS I DO, SO IF WE DO

572
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:03,859
LOSE AND IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,
JESS' BOYFRIEND IS GONE.

573
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,820
>> JUST KNOW THAT AS LONG AS I'M
NOT PASSED OUT ON THE GROUND,

574
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,571
I'M HERE FOR YOU AND I CARE
ABOUT YOU.

575
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:21,042
>> THANKS, COLE.

576
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:36,933
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

577
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:37,809
ALL RIGHT.

578
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,313
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

579
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,773
FIRST THINGS FIRST, I WILL TAKE
BACK THE IDOLS.

580
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,983
DESI, YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT
UP.

581
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,693
>> NEW YORK I'M TAKING GOOD CARE
OF HER.

582
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,361
>> OH, I'M SORRY.

583
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,031
>> Jeff: THANKS, LAUREN.

584
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,743
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

585
00:24:54,826 --> 00:25:00,248
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL
EACH PULL ON A ROPE SUSPENDING A

586
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,374
DISK.

587
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,086
YOU'LL THEN WORK TOGETHER TO
STACK BLOCKS ON THAT DISK

588
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,256
SPELLING "IMMUNITY."

589
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:15,096
IF AT ANY POINT YOU FALL OFF OR
YOUR TACK DROPS, YOU TART AGAIN.

590
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,600
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

591
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,770
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WILL
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH

592
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,564
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

593
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,442
YAWA, ONE EXTRA PERSON, SITTING
SOMEBODY OUT.

594
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,903
DR. MIKE SAT OUT OF THE REWARD
CHALLENGE.

595
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,572
WHO IS GOING TO SIT OUT OF THIS
ONE?

596
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,615
LAUREN TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH.

597
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,783
EVERYBODY ELSE TAKE A MINUTE TO
STRATEGIZE.

598
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:40,747
WE'LL GET STARTED.

599
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,290
ALL RIGHT.

600
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:42,958
HERE WE GO.

COMMUNECATION.

605
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,635

00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,180
>> Jeff: WORKING TOGETHER TO
SPELL IMMUNITY.

607
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,641
REMEMBER, YOU ARE SPELLING IT
FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP.

608
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,143
BEN PLACES THE FIRST BLOCK FOR
YAWA.

609
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,687
>> A LITTLE TIGHTER, RYAN.

610
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,105
>> Jeff: RYAN OUT QUICKLY.

611
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,315
>> PERFECT.

612
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,191
THAT'S RIGHT.

613
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:08,817
>> Jeff: JOE HAS FIRST LETTER
FOR LEVU.

614
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,818
>> I'LL BE NEXT.

615
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,820
>> Jeff: IT'S ALL ABOUT
KEEPING THAT DISK FLAT.

616
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,990

BUDDY.

617
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,865

618
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,660
>> BEN, PULL A LITTLE HARDER.

>> Jeff: AS THIS STACK GROSS,
IT'S GOING TO GET MORE

620
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:22,706
DIFFICULT.

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,124
JESSICA WITH THEIR SECOND
LETTER.

622
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,458
DESI WITH THEIR SECOND LETTER.

623
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,459
>> YOU'RE PULLING IT UP.

624
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,128
>> Jeff: CHRISSY WORKING FOR
THEIR SECOND LETTER.

625
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,171
>> RYAN, PULL A LITTLE, BUDSDY.

626
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,881
>> J.P., I THINK YOU'RE TOO
TIGHT.

627
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,674
>> MY WAY?

628
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,343
>> Jeff: BEN PLACES THE I FOR
YAWA.

629
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,177
LEVU WITH THREE.

630
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,429
SOKO COMING WITH THEIR THIRD.

631
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:45,312
HERE COMES RYAN INCHING CLOSER
WITH THAT I.

632
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,063
ALREADY YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH
MOVEMENT THERE IS.

633
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,065
VERY CLOSE TO LOSING IT EARLY IN
THIS CHALLENGE.

634
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,818
>> RYAN YOU'RE, TOO TIGHT.

635
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,988
>> Jeff: SOKO HAS THE START
OVER, OUR FIRST CASUALTY.

636
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:59,200
LEVU NOW IN THE LEAD WITH THE
FIFTH LETTER.

637
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:03,079
HERE COMES COLE NOW WITH THAT
FIFTH LETTER.

638
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:03,913
SOKO STARTING OVER.

639
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:10,170
ASHLEY PLACES THE SIXTH BLOCK.

640
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,046
LEVU GETTING VERY CLOSE.

641
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,423
PUTTING THE PRESSURE NOW ON
YAWA.

642
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:13,882
THERE'S JESSICA WITH THE SIXTH
BLOCK.

643
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,217
>> THERE YOU GO.

644
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,803
>> Jeff: CHRISSY HAS THE THIRD
BLOCK FOR SOKO.

645
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,387
HERE COMES DESI.

646
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,431
>> NO, NO, NO, DON'T PULL.

647
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,433
>> Jeff: DESI, THEY'RE IN
TROUBLE.

648
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,893
LEVU DROPS JUST LIKE THAT AND
YAWA IS NOW IN THE LEAD.

649
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,937
THAT IS HOW QUICKLY THIS CAN
CHANGE.

650
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,564
>> PULL MORE, RYAN.

651
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,565
>> RYAN!

652
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,359
>> Jeff: AND SOKO DROPS.

653
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,943
BOTH TRIBES NOW STARTING OVER.

654
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,071
>> WE GOT IT, GUYS.

655
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,989
>> Jeff: DR. MIKE NOW FOR
YAWA.

656
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:42,911
THEY HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE, ONLY
ONE BLOCK LEFT TO WIN IMMUNITY

657
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:48,583
AND A LOT OF TIME WHILE SOKO AND
LEVU BATTLE IT OUT FOR THE

658
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,125
SECOND IMMUNITY.

659
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,668
>> KEEP BREATHING, GUYS.

660
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,753
DON'T MOVE YOUR ARMS.

661
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,296
>> Jeff: HERE GOES COLE.

662
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,756
HE'S MAKING HIS MOVES.

663
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,424
COLE CAN WIN IT FOR YAWA RIGHT
HERE.

664
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,426
>> GO AHEAD, COLE, SLOWLY.

665
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,429
>> Jeff: CAN COLE FINISH IT
RIGHT HERE?

666
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,600
>> SHE -- SLOW AND STEADY.

667
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,268
>> Jeff: COLE HAS THE I.

668
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,478
THEY ARE STEADY.

669
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,440
NOW HE JUST HAS TO GET BACK TO
THE FINISH WITHOUT ANY MOVEMENT

670
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,608
AND THERE GOES THE MOVE.

671
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,776
AND YAWA IS OUT.

672
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,569
YAWA HAS TO START OVER.

673
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,448
THEY WERE JUST A FEW FOOTSTEPS
AWAY FROM IMMUNITY.

674
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,908
THE DOOR IS BACK OPEN.

675
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:27,747
IT IS NOW LEVU AND SOKO DEAD
EVEN WITH FIVE BLOCKS EACH.

676
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:32,085
THIS IS HOW FAST THIS GAME
CHANGES.

677
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,003
BEN IS NEW RACING OUT WITH THAT
FIRST BLOCK.

678
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,798
IT IS NOW ASHLEY WITH THE SIXTH
BLOCK.

679
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,215
>> THERE WE GO.

680
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,133
WE STRAIGHT NOW.

681
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,593
>> Jeff: HERE COMES ALI WITH
THE SIXTH BLOCK.

682
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,010
THIS WOULD TIE THEM WITH LEVU.

683
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,053
>> WE GOT THIS.

684
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,473
>> Jeff: YAWA WITH TWO,
QUICKLY CHASING EVERYBODY.

685
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,308
HERE COMES COLE WITH THE THIRD
LETTER.

686
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,936
>> Jeff: CHRISSY NOW WITH THE
SEVENTH LETTER FOR SOKO.

687
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,981
LEVU RIGHT ON THEIR HEELS WITH
THEIR SEVENTH LETTER.

688
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,483
>> WE GOT THE TENSION, MIKE.

689
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,067
YOU JUST WALK.

690
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,152
>> MIKE, WE GOT THE ROPE.

691
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,363
>> Jeff: YAWA WITH A
COMPLETELY NEW STRATEGY, RACING

692
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,281
TO CATCH UP.

693
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,158
MIKE NOW WITH THE FOURTH LETTER.

694
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,662
WE HAVE LEVU AND SOKO BOTH WITH
SEVEN LETTERS, JUST ONE LETTER

695
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:08,329
LEFT.

696
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:08,997
YAWA IS ALREADY HALFWAY THERE.

697
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,957
MIKE WITH THEIR FIFTH.

698
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,168
YAWA'S STRATEGY MAY BE PAYING
OFF.

699
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,169
>> JUST WALK IT BACK, MIKE.

700
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,505
>> Jeff: HERE COMES J.P. WITH
THAT FINAL LETTER.

701
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,590
>> JUST GO SLOW.

702
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,801
>> Jeff: HE CANNOT MOVE AS
FAST AS YAWA IS BECAUSE THE

703
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,053
STACK IS SO TALL.

704
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:24,929
DEVON MOVING VERY SLOWLY.

705
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,265
>> WHOA, WHOA, DEVON.

706
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,643
>> Jeff: JESSICA COMING OUT
NOW WITH THEIR SEVENTH LETTER.

707
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,144
>> YOU GUYS GOT IT?

708
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,021
>> YEP, WE HAVE IT.

709
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,522
>> Jeff: J.P. VERY CLOSE.

710
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,773
>> CAREFUL, J.P.

711
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,067
>> Jeff: BUT THAT TOWER IS
LEANING.

712
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,196
JESSICA PLACES THE SEVENTH
LETTER FOR YAWA.

713
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,155
DEVON NOW MAKING HIS MOVE.

714
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,531
>> SLOWLY.

715
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,700
>> CAREFUL, J.P.

716
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:46,868
>> J.P.

717
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,370
>> Jeff: J.P. PLACES THE I,
BUT HE'S GOT TO GET IT TO STICK.

718
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,371
>> TAKE YOU TIME.

719
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,957
>> DREW: JESSICA NEW RACING OUT
WITH THE I.

720
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,042
EVERYBODY IS IN IT NOW.

721
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,251
>> GET IT.

722
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,754
>> YOU'RE DOING GOOD, DEV.

723
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,382
>> Jeff: DEVON PLACES THE I,
BUT HE KNOWS IT IS WOBBLY.

724
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,092
>> DO NOT LET IT DROP.

725
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,053
>> Jeff: JESSICA PLACES IF I
FOR YAWA.

726
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,263
>> EVERYBODY HAS THEIR BLOCKS.

727
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,598
IT'S NOW A RACE TO THE FINISH.

728
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,893
>> GET BACK, JESS.

729
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,936
>> DON'T MOVE.

730
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,730
NOBODY MOVE.

731
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:17,732
>> WE WIN.

732
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:18,733
>> WE GOT IT.

733
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,027
>> Jeff: YAWA WINS IMMUNITY.

734
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,862
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SECOND.

735
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,113
SOAK SECOND DROPPED.

736
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,365
SOKO IS OUT NOW.

737
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,077
LEVU HAS A SHOT RIGHT HERE.

738
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:35,250
LEVU WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

739
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:46,928
SENDING SOKO FOR THE SIXTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

740
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,721
YAWA, CONGRATULATIONS.

741
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,974
NOBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

742
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,978
LEVU, EVERYBODY WILL LIVE TO SEE
ANOTHER DAY.

743
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,062
ALL RIGHT.

744
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,523
YAWA, LEVU, NO TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.

745
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,108
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

746
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,944
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

747
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,279
ALL RIGHT.

748
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,446
SOKO, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

749
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,156
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SIXTH

750
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,784
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

751
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:14,289
>> AFTER TRIBAL I HAD A BLOW-UP
WITH RYAN, SO I KNOW THAT MY

752
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,125
NAME HAS BEEN ON THE LINE, AND
I'M MORE NERVOUS THAN I PROBABLY

753
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,504
EVER HAVE BEEN.

754
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,101
>> I THINK JEFF LIKES US.

755
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:40,106
WE ALWAYS HAVE A LOT OF DATES
WITH HIM, HUH?

756
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,067
>> YEP.

757
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,987
>> WELL, TODAY'S CHALLENGE
DIDN'T GO SO WELL, BUT LOSING

758
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,281
FOR US RIGHT NOW IS JUST NOT A
BIG DEAL.

759
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,826
ALI IS NEXT, AND SHE HAS NOTHING
SHE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

760
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:56,956
SIMPLE AS THAT.

761
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,166
>> SUCKS TO LOSE, BUT
SOMETIMES...

762
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,125
>> I DID NOT WANT TO LOSE.

763
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,128
>> IT ALL WORKS OUT FOR THE
BETTER.

764
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,339
>> YEAH.

765
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,051
ALI IS THE OBVIOUS NEXT TARGET,
BUT J.P. IS A HUGE PHYSICAL

766
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,302
THREAT.

767
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,013
I MEAN, HE HAS LITERALLY CARRIED
US, HE'S CARRIED ME THROUGH A

768
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,014
CHALLENGE, LITERALLY.

769
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,683
TAKING THAT GUY INTO A MERGE,
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

770
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,185
>> AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME, I
REALLY DON'T CARE.

771
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,895
MY VOTE IS ALI.

772
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,688
>> ME TOO.

773
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,191
AND SO IS CHRISSY.

774
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,402
BUT IN ORDER TO VOTE OUT J.P., I
NEED TO MAKE UP WITH ALI.

775
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,530
SHE TRUSTED ME A LOT, AND I DID
BACKSTAB HER.

776
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,156
I NEED HER TO GET RID OF J.P.

777
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:38,039
FOR THIS VOTE.

778
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,832
>> I'M SORRY.

779
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,792
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

780
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,085
>> YEAH.

781
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,587
>> THAT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.

782
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,089
I WAS PETRIFIED OF ROARK.

783
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:52,428
>> I'M JUST PETRIFIED I'M GOING
HOME.

784
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,055
>> I DO NOT THINK THAT.

785
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,223
I HAVE YOUR BACK.

786
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:59,060
AND I KNOW THAT'S INCREDIBLY
HARD FOR YOU TO ACCEPT RIGHT

787
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,561
NOW, BUT THAT'S TRUE.

788
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,815
>> AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, I WAS DEFINITELY ON THE

789
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,025
OUTS, BUT I THINK I FOUND MY
CRACK.

790
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,861
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT ONE MORE
VOTE UNTIL THE MERGE, ONE OR TWO

791
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:09,904
AT THE MOST.

792
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,572
>> WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD DO J.P.

793
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,907
>> HE WAS DOMINANT TODAY.

794
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,743
>> HE'S WITHIN DOMINANT EVERY
DAY.

795
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,912
>> AND HE LAYS LOW A LOT.

796
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,372
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS HEAD
IS.

797
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,581
>> THAT'S SCARY.

798
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,127
>> I STILL CAN'T TRUST RYAN, BUT
HE DEFINITELY SEES J.P. IS A

799
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:24,836
THREAT.

800
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,878
>> WE NEED CHRISSY TO COME OVER.

801
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,298
>> I'LL TALK TO HER FIRST AND
SEE WHAT SHE THINKS.

802
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,925
NOW I NEED TO GET WITH CHRISSY.

803
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:35,054
I KNOW THAT I VOTED FOR CHRISSY,
BUT THE THING IS, I KNOW THAT

804
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,305
CHRISSY IS A VERY SMART PERSON.

805
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:41,936
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO
KEEP J.P.

806
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:45,314
>> I THINK SO FAR IN THIS GAME
MY DOWNFALL HAS BEEN MY LOYALTY.

807
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,443
I THINK THAT I JUST PUT IT IN
THE WRONG PERSON.

808
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,739
I KNOW I HAVE LAUREN 100%.

809
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,451
AND I KNOW I HAVE A GREAT
RELATIONSHIP WITH DEVON.

810
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,121
GOING FORWARD I AM LOYAL, AND I
WANT THE PROVE IT TO YOU.

811
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,499
>> I WAS THINKING THIS IS
PROBABLY THE LAST VOTE OUT

812
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,792
BEFORE THE MERGE.

813
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,796
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHAT
MAKES THIS FOUR-MAN TEAM STRONG.

814
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,342
WHAT MATTERS TO ME IS WHO CAN I
BEAT ONCE WE GET TO THE MERGE.

815
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,137
>> I DEFINITELY THINK THAT
J.P.'S GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND

816
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,972
STRUT.

817
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:18,973
YOU SEE HOW HE IS.

818
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,808
HE'S GOING THE TRY AND WIN
EVERYTHING.

819
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,018
>> YES, YES.

820
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:26,397
>> YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I COULD
PUT THE LOYALTY THAT I PUT IN

821
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,482
RYAN IN YOU.

822
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,443
>> ALI TOLD ME THAT SHE'S
EXTREMELY LOYAL AND GOING

823
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,780
FORWARD SHE REALLY WANTS TO WORK
TOGETHER AND GET RID OF J.P.

824
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:38,367
I THINK THAT J.P. IS A THREAT,
BUT TRUTHFULLY, ALI VOTED FOR ME

825
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:43,498
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, SO I DON'T
KNOW IF I CAN EVEN TRUST ALI

826
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,792
MOVING FORWARD.

827
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,253
THE ONE PERSON I AM MOST CLOSELY
ALIGNED WITH IS RYAN, AND

828
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,672
TOGETHER WE NEED TO MAKE THE
DECISION ON WHICH OF THE TWO

829
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,884
GOES HOME TONIGHT.

830
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,387
>> I WANTED TO PLAY WITH PEOPLE
WHO LIKE...

831
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,389
>> LIKE LOVE THE GAME, WANT THE
PLAY THE GAME.

832
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,307
>> YEAH, YEAH.

833
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,018
>> EITHER WAY WE'RE GOOD.

834
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,353
>> I'M IS HAPPY.

835
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,356
I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO PLAY THE
GAME WITH YOU.

836
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,440
I KNOW.

837
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:13,194
J.P. AND ALI ARE POLAR
OPPOSITES, YET CONCURRENTLY THEY

838
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,363
BOTH WANT TO WORK WITH ME AND
CHRISSY.

839
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,366
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY WANTS
TO WORK WITH ME.

840
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,828
I THINK I'M A FREAKIN' WEASEL,
BUT THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO

841
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,915
SOMEBODY, THEY CAN'T REALLY SEE
YOU GO BEHIND THEIR BACK AND

842
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:38,636
BACKSTAB THEM.

843
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,898
>> Jeff: SO THE ROLLER COASTER
CONTINUES FOR THE SOKO TRIBE.

844
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,360
RYAN, AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL,
WHICH WAS CLEARLY A BLIND SIDE,

845
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,278
WHAT HAPPENED BACK AT CAMP.

846
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:59,282
>> YEAH, SO ALI WAS NOT PLEASED.

847
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,368
YOU KNOW, SHE HAD BEEN ON THE
WRONG SIDE OF THE ROARK VOTE, SO

848
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:06,289
I HAD JUST TOLD HER MY REASONING
BEHIND IT.

849
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:10,543
I REALLY FELT ROARK WAS GOING TO
FLIP BACK TO THAT STRONG HEALER

850
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,628
CONTINGENCY THAT'S STILL IN THE
GAME UP TO THIS POINT.

851
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,464
>> Jeff: ALI, I'M GUESSING YOU
SAID, YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME

852
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,257
THAT.

853
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,759
>> YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I
FELT.

854
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:23,055
IF HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME FROM
THE GET-GO, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

855
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:23,764
WETTER.

856
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,725
I APOLOGIZED AND HE APOLOGIZED.

857
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,936
I THINK IT'S SWEPT UNDER THE RUG
AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD NOW.

858
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,314
>> Jeff: SO CHRISSY, WE'RE
ALMOST HALFWAY THROUGH THE GAME.

859
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,234
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THAT
POINT.

860
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,360
WHAT'S THE FEELING?

861
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,779
>> THE FEELING IS WE ALL BELIEVE
THERE IS A MERGE THAT IS

862
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,782
IMMINENT, AND ALL FOUR OF US
WANT TO MAKE IT TO THE MERGE.

863
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,660
CLEARLY THAT'S NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN.

864
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,287
>> Jeff: SO ALI, DOES THAT
INFLUENCE TONIGHT'S VOTE?

865
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:51,292
>> YEAH, BECAUSE ONCE WE GET
INTO A MERGE, YOU NEED NUMBERS.

866
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,795
YOU NEED PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST
GOING FORWARD.

867
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,964
NOT ONLY PEOPLE THAT WILL FIGHT
FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR YOU, AS

868
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,049
WELL.

869
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,343
>> Jeff: J.P., THAT'S WHERE
YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE

870
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,470
CONCERNED, BECAUSE WHEN YOU
REACH THE MERGE, THEN IT'S ABOUT

871
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,638
GETTING RID OF CONTENDERS.

872
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:08,976
>> TRADITIONALLY, THE BIGGER
GUYS OR THE GUYS THAT SEEM TO DO

873
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,271
A LITTLE BETTER AT THE
CHALLENGES TEND TO GET VOTED OFF

874
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:12,813
AROUND THIS TIME.

875
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,898
WHY NOT GET RID OF J.P.

876
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,524
SO IT'S DEFINITELY A LITTLE
SCARY TO BE SITTING HERE

877
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,150
TONIGHT.

878
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:18,277
>> Jeff: SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

879
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,570
YOU HAD TO THINK ABOUT THAT
TODAY WITH TRIBAL COMING

880
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,821
TONIGHT.

881
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,991
>> YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO
SAY THE MAKE YOU CASE, BUT AT

882
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,328
THE END OF THE DAY, IT COMES
DOWN THE WHAT'S IN EVERYBODY'S

883
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,788
BEST INTEREST TO MOVE THEIR GAME
FORWARD.

884
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,083
>> Jeff: ALI, J.P. GAVE AN
INTERESTING ANSWER TO A VERY

885
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:32,833
SPECIFIC QUESTION.

886
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,961
BY SAYING NOTHING.

887
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:39,090
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE PLAYING
AS LAID BACK RIGHT NOW AS J.P.

888
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,341
WHAT DO YOU READ INTO THAT?

889
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,344
>> YEAH, HE DIDN'T SAY, WELL, I
BRING THIS AND I BRING THIS OR

890
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,390
WHAT HE'S GOING TO OFFER IF HE
DOES END UP WINNING ALL THESE

891
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,265
CHALLENGES.

892
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,185
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE'S
THINKING, EVER.

893
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,521
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, SURPRISED
THAT J.P. DIDN'T SAY, LET ME

894
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,232
TELL YOU WHY I'M NOT A GOOD
PERSON TO GET RID OF?

895
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,694
>> NO, I'VE KNOWN J.P. SINCE DAY
ONE, AND J.P. PLAYS A QUIET

896
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,903
GAME.

897
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,281
>> Jeff: RYAN, CAN YOU
APPRECIATE WHY J.P. WOULD BE

898
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,534
RELUCTANT TO DEFEND HIMSELF,
BECAUSE IT ONLY JUST SHINES THE

899
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:11,664
LIGHT BRIGHTER ON THE OBVIOUS
THING, HE'S CLEARLY THE MOST

900
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,581
PHYSICAL GUY HERE.

901
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,875
>> AS CHRISSY SAID, IT'S A VERY
QUIET GAME.

902
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,085
SOMETIMES THAT'S SCARY, AS WELL.

903
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,088
IF I CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH YOU AND I SEE YOU AT THE

904
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,675
REWARD CHALLENGE LIKE BASKING IN
THE IMLORRY, I MEAN, HE'S NOT

905
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,884
MISSING MUCH.

906
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,721
THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE PIECES
REQUEST FOR THIS GUY TO BECOME A

907
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,680
SUPER PLAYER.

908
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,640
SO DO I WANT TO GO AGAINST THAT?

909
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,559
DO I WANT TO WORK WITH THAT?

910
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,768
IT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

911
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,603
>> Jeff: J.P., I GOT TO GIVE
YOU CREDIT, BECAUSE THROUGH THIS

912
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:39,108
ENTIRE TRIBAL, YOU ARE LIKE THE
PIECE OF GRANITE YOU APPEAR TO

913
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,234
BE CARVED FROM.

914
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:40,901
YOU HAVE NOT PROVED.

915
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,028
YOU ARE COMMITTED.

916
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:45,031
SO IF IT'S YOU TONIGHT, WILL YOU
SAY, THIS IS MY GAME.

917
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,240
I'M FINE WITH IT?

918
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:51,370
>> I THINK IF I WAS TO WALK DOWN
THAT PATH, I PROBABLY SHOULD

919
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,916
HAVE BEEN MORE SOCIAL AND OPEN
WITH THE GAME.

920
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,752
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE
THAT.

921
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:03,424
MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD WAKE-UP
CALL FOR ME.

922
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,094
>> Jeff: ALI, IS THIS A
REMINDER OF HOW REAL IT ALL IS?

923
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,431
>> OH YEAH,, IT'S THE ATMOSPHERE
BEING HERE.

924
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,894
MY BODY IS TRICKING ME THE THINK
I'M COLD, I'M SHAKING.

925
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,103
BUT I THINK IT'S THE
NERVOUSNESS.

926
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,689
I'M IN A NERVOUS POSITION ANYWAY
BECAUSE I WAS NOT INCLUDED ON

927
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,067
THE LAST VOTE.

928
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,904
I'M STILL HOPING THAT WHAT I
THINK ARE MENDED RELATIONSHIPS

929
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,113
ARE REALLY MENDED.

930
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,950
WE'LL FIND OUT WHERE THE TRUST
LIES WHEN THE VOTE IS REVEALED.

931
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,453
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, YOU SEEM TO
BE NODDING YOUR HEAD.

932
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,081
>> IT'S TERRIBLE WHEN THE
NUMBERS GET SMALL BECAUSE THERE

933
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,582
ARE NO EXTRAS TO VOTE OUT.

934
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:40,336
WITH WE'RE FOUR GREAT PLAYERS,
ALL OF US WANT THIS SO BADLY, SO

935
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,505
I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL JUST
CONSTANTLY EVALUATING RIGHT NOW,

936
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,800
WHO DO I WANT TO VOTE OUT.

937
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,177
EVERY SINGLE PERSON HERE
BENEFITS MY GAME AND HURTS MY

938
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,138
GAME.

939
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:51,806
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

940
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,933
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

941
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:58,229
J.P., YOU'RE UP.

942
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,607
>> I GOT MY GAME.

943
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,775
YOU GOT YOU GAME.

944
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:10,825
SEE WHO WINS.

945
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:24,672
>> WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE
STRONG.

946
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:34,140
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

947
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,351
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

948
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:41,021
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

949
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,022
OKAY.

950
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,692
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

951
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,652
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

952
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,696
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

953
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,531
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

954
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:55,327
FIRST VOTE, ALI.

955
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:55,703
J.P.

956
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,996
ONE VOTE ALI.

957
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,667
ONE VOTE J.P.

958
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,710
ALI.

959
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:08,883
THAT'S TWO VOTES ALI, ONE VOTE
J.P., ONE VOTE LEFT.

960
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,552
SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT...

961
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,179
>> YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

962
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:26,400
ALI, YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.

963
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:31,614
>> GOOD LUCK BEATING HIM.

964
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,616
WOW.

965
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:38,704
>> Jeff: ALI, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

966
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:48,047
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

967
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,926
WELL, YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF TRIBE
MEMBERS AND YOU ARE CLEARLY

968
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:52,635
COUNTING ON A MERGE.

969
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,636
GOOD LUCK.

970
00:41:53,719 --> 00:42:00,768

00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,488
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

976
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:19,620
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," A BOMB IS DROPPED.

977
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,913
>> YOU ARE MERGED.

978

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> THE MERGE, THAT'S WHAT YOU

979
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:23,958
DREAM OF.

980
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,959
THIS IS THE PLAYOFFS NOW.

981
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,835
>> Jeff: THE TARGET IS IN
SIGHT.

982
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,420
>> COLE IS THE BIGGEST THREAT.

983
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,631
>> THE BATTLE LINE IS DRAWN.

984
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,675
>> HE'S GOING TO FLIP ON YOU
ALL.

985
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:33,926
>> I EXPECT A WAR.

986
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:40,349
>> I GUESS I LET A LITTLE TWERP
LIKE RYAN RUIN MY WHOLE GAME,

987
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,477
AND CHRISSY IS THE LIAR OF ALL
LIARS.

988
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,146
IF SHE LIES THAT WAY THE REST OF
THE GAME, SHE'S GOING TO WIN.

989
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,984
I CAME INTO THIS GAME THINKING I
WAS GOING TO PLAY WITH MY HEAD,

990
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,986
AND MAYBE I DID USE MY HEART A
LITTLE BIT.

991
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,861
MAYBE I TRUSTED PEOPLE TOO MUCH.

992
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,905
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME.
